         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis second Volume of the second Part of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> had long since been made Publick, had it not been for an unfortunate Accident which befel me when it was almost fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, by which I was necessitated almost to begin again, and cast the whole into a different Method from what I first designed; for according to my first Draught, this second Volume had not ammounted to much above half of what it now is, only I intended to have added some Notes at the end of it, for the fuller proof and explanation of several Points therein handled, which now I am forced to leave out, the Book
<pb facs="tcp:58668:3"/>
being already swell'd so much beyond my first Intention, only three or four of them I am forced to Print with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I had referr'd to them in two of the Sheets which were Printed before I new model'd the whole Design. I pray God prosper this Work, according to its honest Intention, and that will be an abundant compensation for all the Pains and Labor I have undergone in composing it.</p>

been <hi>made known,</hi> and sufficiently <hi>proposed,</hi> we cannot be <hi>good men</hi> unless we <hi>believe it,</hi> and if we believe it we cannot be <hi>good Christians</hi> unless we <hi>practise</hi> upon it. And since Christianity hath <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi> the duties of <hi>Natural Religion</hi> upon new <hi>Principles,</hi> and <hi>enforced</hi> them with new <hi>Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> to render our Piety and Vertue <hi>strictly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> Christian, it is necessary we should <hi>believe</hi> these new Principles, and <hi>act</hi> upon these new Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations; otherwise we are at best but meer <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men,</hi> in the true sence of the Apostle, <hi>i. e.</hi> men who are meerly conducted by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason, and have not <hi>received the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> that is, the <hi>new</hi> Principles and Obligations which <hi>Christianity superadds</hi> to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</p>
            <p>In handling therefore of this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> Principle of <hi>Christian Life, viz.</hi> the <hi>belief</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment</hi> of Christ's being the <hi>one</hi> and <hi>only</hi> Mediator, I shall endeavour these <hi>three</hi> things:</p>
            <p>First, To shew what it is that we are to believe in <hi>general</hi> concerning the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of this <hi>Mediator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, What are the particular <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of his <hi>Mediation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, What <hi>Evidence</hi> there is to induce us to <hi>believe</hi> him to be this <hi>one</hi> and <hi>only</hi> Mediator.</p>

               <head>SECT. I. What it is that we are to believe <hi>in general</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</hi>

               <p>THE Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate <hi>Mediator,</hi> signifies one that <hi>interposes</hi> between <hi>two</hi> Parties, either to <hi>obtain</hi> some <hi>favour</hi> from the <hi>one</hi> Party for the <hi>other,</hi> or to <hi>adjust</hi> or <hi>make up</hi> some <hi>difference</hi> between them. And this undertaking of his, is either, first, of his <hi>own head</hi> and <hi>voluntary,</hi> undertaking without any <hi>Warrant</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> from the <hi>Parties</hi> between whom he interposes, in which case he acts altogether <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariously,</hi> and as a meer <hi>Orator,</hi> and can only <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade</hi> and <hi>intreat</hi> on both sides; or secondly, it is <hi>Authoritative,</hi> and this is two ways; first, when the Person who <hi>mediates</hi> is <hi>Authorized</hi> thereunto by the <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>designation</hi> of <hi>both</hi> Parties, both being <hi>equal,</hi> and consequently having an equal <hi>right</hi> to Authorize him. For when the Parties are <hi>equal,</hi> he must be authorized by <hi>both</hi> before he can pretend to any right to <hi>oblige</hi> and <hi>determine</hi> them; but when once both Parties have <hi>agreed</hi> to put their case into <hi>his</hi> hands, and refer themselves to <hi>his</hi> determination, he from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth commences a <hi>Mediator</hi> by <hi>Office,</hi> and is the <hi>Legal Representative</hi> of both, as being Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by them to act in <hi>their</hi> stead in all those points that are <hi>referred</hi> by them to his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that whatsoever <hi>he</hi> doth in the matter
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58668:14"/>
before him is in effect the act of <hi>both</hi> Parties, who having both submitted <hi>their</hi> wills to <hi>his,</hi> and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily impowered him to will <hi>for</hi> them both, are thereupon as effectually <hi>concluded</hi> and <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi> by what <hi>he</hi> doth, as if it were their own <hi>personal</hi> Will and Action. And in this sence a <hi>Mediator</hi> is the same with that which we in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish call an <hi>Vmpire,</hi> who is one that <hi>acts</hi> for <hi>both</hi> Parties by <hi>Authority</hi> from <hi>both,</hi> and in whose <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>determination</hi> both have obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>agree.</hi> But then secondly, the Mediation is <hi>authoritative</hi> when he who <hi>mediates</hi> is <hi>Authorized</hi> thereunto by a <hi>superiour</hi> Party, who hath a just <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> over the <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour.</hi> For when a Mediator acts the part of two <hi>unequal</hi> Parties, whereof the <hi>one</hi> is <hi>superiour,</hi> and hath a just dominion over the <hi>other,</hi> it is sufficient that he be Authorized by the appointment of the <hi>superiour,</hi> and the <hi>subject</hi> or <hi>inferiour</hi> Party will be as much <hi>obliged</hi> by his <hi>determination,</hi> as if he had <hi>voluntarily</hi> referred <hi>himself</hi> to him. For a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between a <hi>Superiour,</hi> as such, and a <hi>Subject,</hi> is one who is Authorized to act on the part of the Superiour in <hi>requiring</hi> the Subjects <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and to act on the part of the Subject in <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrating</hi> the Superiour's <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>protection</hi>; and there can be no doubt but every <hi>absolute</hi> Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour hath <hi>right</hi> to Authorize a Mediator between <hi>him</hi> and his <hi>Subjects,</hi> to act for <hi>him</hi> in <hi>ruling</hi> them, and for <hi>them</hi> in <hi>soliciting</hi> his favour. For he who Mediates between a <hi>Sovereign</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi> is the Sovereign's <hi>Vicegerent</hi> and the Subject's <hi>Advocate</hi>; and he who <hi>without</hi> our <hi>consent</hi> hath a right to our <hi>duty,</hi> and to all the <hi>favours</hi> he bestows upon us,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58668:15"/>
may, whether <hi>we</hi> consent to it or <hi>no, demand</hi> our <hi>duty</hi> by what Vicegerent, and <hi>bestow</hi> his <hi>favours</hi> by what Advocate he pleases. And as for the <hi>Subject,</hi> he will be <hi>obliged,</hi> whether it be <hi>by</hi> his consent or no, to <hi>abide by</hi> the <hi>Mediator</hi> whom the Sovereign <hi>appoints,</hi> and by the <hi>terms</hi> which he shall <hi>impose</hi> on him; otherwise he will be <hi>justly</hi> liable to <hi>punishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having given this <hi>short</hi> account of the <hi>general</hi> Notion of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> I proceed to shew what it is <hi>in the general</hi> that the Scripture proposes to our belief concerning the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of this great <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and men; the whole of which I shall reduce under these six heads:</p>
               <p>First, That he is <hi>Designed</hi> and <hi>Authorized</hi> to this <hi>Office</hi> by <hi>God</hi> who is our absolute <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Sovereign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That this Office to which he is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized consists in acting <hi>for</hi> and in the <hi>behalf</hi> of God and men, who are the <hi>parties</hi> between whom he Mediates.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That this his Mediation proceeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certain <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>stipulations</hi> between God and men, which he obtained of God <hi>for</hi> us, and in his name hath published and tendered <hi>to</hi> us.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That as he acts for and in the behalf of God and men, so he partakes of the <hi>natures</hi> of <hi>both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, That as he partakes of the natures <hi>of</hi> both, so, that he might transact personally <hi>with</hi> both, he was <hi>sent down</hi> from Heaven to <hi>us,</hi> and is <hi>returned</hi> again from us to <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, That upon his return from us to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there to Mediate personally for <hi>Men</hi> with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58668:15"/>
                  <hi>God,</hi> he substituted the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Omnipresent Spirit</hi> personally to <hi>promote</hi> and <hi>effectuate</hi> his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation for <hi>God</hi> with <hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. That he is <hi>Designed</hi> and <hi>Authorized</hi> to this <hi>Office</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> who is our absolute <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign.</hi> For since God for <hi>just</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons was resolved not to converse with sinful men <hi>immediately,</hi> they having rendered themselves, through their woful <hi>degeneracy,</hi> utterly <hi>unsit</hi> for, and <hi>unworthy</hi> of any such <hi>near</hi> and <hi>close</hi> access to his most holy Majesty; and since his tender <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>compassion</hi> towards us would not permit him utterly to <hi>reject</hi> and <hi>abandon</hi> us, there was no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, at least that <hi>we</hi> know of, in which the <hi>holiness</hi> of his <hi>Majesty</hi> could so fairly <hi>accord</hi> with the <hi>tenderness</hi> of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> as <hi>this</hi> of transacting with us by a <hi>Mediator,</hi> by whose <hi>inter-agency, he,</hi> though a most <hi>holy</hi> Sovereign, may without <hi>deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> himself <hi>freely</hi> converse with <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>we,</hi> though his <hi>guilty</hi> subjects, may without <hi>terrour</hi> and <hi>anxiety</hi> as <hi>freely</hi> draw near unto <hi>him</hi>; But, by vertue of his essential <hi>Sovereignty</hi> and absolute <hi>Dominion</hi> over us, the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>choosing</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing</hi> this Mediator was wholly in <hi>him,</hi> because, as I shewed just before, he only can have the right of appointing the person who shall be <hi>his</hi> Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent and <hi>our</hi> Advocate, who is the Sovereign <hi>Lord</hi> of our <hi>beings,</hi> and the supreme <hi>dispos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

being anciently the <hi>visible</hi> sign by which the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Priestly,</hi> and <hi>Prophetick</hi> Offices were conferred. This Title of the <hi>Lord's Anointed</hi> therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied to <hi>Iesus,</hi> denotes his being <hi>designed, appointed,</hi> and <hi>authorized</hi> by God to this <hi>great</hi> Office of <hi>Mediator,</hi> in which all those <hi>three</hi> Offices are included. For so, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. we are told, <hi>him, i. e.</hi> Christ, <hi>hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour to give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto Israel, and forgiveness of sins</hi>; And <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. <hi>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Iesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ</hi>; and, 10 name no more, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. <hi>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Iesus every Knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Iesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</hi> The <hi>belief</hi> of which is absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> to create in our minds the <hi>reverence</hi> that is due to our <hi>holy Religion.</hi> For unless we suppose the <hi>founder</hi> of it to be <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized</hi> and <hi>Commissioned</hi> by God, we must <hi>strip</hi> and <hi>disarm</hi> it of all its <hi>authority,</hi> and look upon it at best but as a <hi>Pious Imposture,</hi> contrived on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to <hi>Chouce</hi> men of their <hi>Sins,</hi> and to <hi>train</hi> and <hi>delude</hi> them into <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> For as it is a <hi>Religion,</hi> it can have no <hi>Authority</hi> but <hi>Divine,</hi> and a Divine Authority it cannot have unless the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of it had a <hi>Divine Commission</hi>; but supposing him to be Commissioned from God, we owe the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>God's mouth,</hi> hath delivered to us, than it would have been for a <hi>Iew</hi> to have <hi>laughed</hi> at the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments while God <hi>himself</hi> was proclaiming them from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in a voice of Thunder. For if we <hi>believe</hi> that God authorized <hi>him</hi> to reveal his Will to us, we must believe <hi>his</hi> voice to be the <hi>voice of God,</hi> who spake to us by him as by a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Oracle</hi>; and consequently, that in refusing to <hi>hear</hi> and to <hi>obey</hi> him we stop our ears against <hi>God,</hi> and do in effect declare that we regard what he saith no more than we do the whistling of the Wind. And as the belief of Christ's being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned and appointed by God is highly necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Create in us a due reverence for his Religion, so it is no less <hi>requisite</hi> to create in us a due <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> in his <hi>Intercession</hi> for us. For had he <hi>thrust</hi> himself upon this Office without any <hi>Call</hi> or <hi>Commission</hi> from God, God would have been no way obliged to <hi>hear</hi> him how <hi>earnestly</hi> soever he had <hi>supplicated</hi> in our behalf; but since he <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes</hi> for us by God's <hi>own</hi> Commission, we may <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend</hi> upon it that God will be always <hi>ready</hi> to hear him, and <hi>graciously</hi> accept our <hi>addresses</hi> to him when ever they are <hi>presented</hi> by <hi>his</hi> hand. For since God appointed him to be our <hi>Advocate,</hi> it must be either with an intent to <hi>hear</hi> him in our <hi>behalf,</hi> and if <hi>so,</hi> we may be sure his <hi>Ears</hi> will be always <hi>open</hi> to him; or with a design to <hi>mock</hi> and <hi>ridicule</hi> him, and <hi>recreate</hi> his own <hi>inexorable</hi> spleen with the <hi>spiteful</hi> pleasure of <hi>denying</hi> and <hi>repulsing</hi> him, which to imagine of God is no less <hi>senseless</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:58668:17"/>
than <hi>blasphemous.</hi> Since therefore he <hi>Advocates</hi> for us by God's own <hi>Commission,</hi> we may be sure his <hi>Plea</hi> in our behalf will be always <hi>acceptable</hi> and <hi>successful,</hi> since in repulsing <hi>him,</hi> he must in effect affront his <hi>own</hi> Authority by <hi>which</hi> he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for us.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That this Office to which he is authorized consists in acting <hi>for,</hi> and in the <hi>behalf</hi> of God and Men, who are the <hi>Parties</hi> between whom he Mediates. And this is implied in the very <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of an <hi>authorised Mediator,</hi> who, as <hi>such,</hi> is an Agent between <hi>two</hi> Parties, acting by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for <hi>both,</hi> in order to the <hi>adjusting</hi> some <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> between them, and <hi>reducing</hi> them to a mutual <hi>accord</hi> and <hi>agreement</hi>; and if he act only for <hi>one</hi> Party, he is not a <hi>Mediator,</hi> but an <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourney</hi>; and accordingly the Apostle tells us, that <hi>a Mediator is not a Mediator of one, but God is one,</hi> Gal. 3.20. For the better understanding of which words it is to be considered that in the foregoing Verse the Apostle had asserted, that <hi>the Law was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator,</hi> that is, in the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> who was appointed to Mediate not only for <hi>God</hi> with the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> but also for the <hi>People of Israel</hi> with God; and this, saith he, is implied in the very Notion of a Mediator, for <hi>a Mediator is not of one, but God is one,</hi> that is, God is only <hi>one</hi> of the two Parties between whom this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, and therefore <hi>Moses</hi> must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed not only to act for God with the People as <hi>his</hi> Vicegerent, but also for the People with God as <hi>their</hi> Advocate; in short, he must act for <hi>both</hi> Parties, otherwise he acts not as a <hi>Mediator.</hi> And
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58668:17"/>
accordingly as <hi>Moses</hi> who was the Mediator of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Covenant acted <hi>for</hi> and <hi>between</hi> God and the People, so <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the <hi>Christian</hi> Covenant, is stiled the <hi>one Mediator between God and men,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. that is, that <hi>goes between</hi> the <hi>two</hi> opposite Parties, and transacts for <hi>both</hi> in order to their <hi>accord</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi>; that as <hi>God</hi>'s Vicegerent acts for <hi>him</hi> with <hi>us</hi> in order to the reducing us to our <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>allegiance</hi> to him, and as <hi>our</hi> Advocate acts for <hi>us</hi> with <hi>God</hi> in order to the inducing him to be <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>favourable</hi> to us; that so having <hi>prevailed</hi> with us to <hi>lay down</hi> our <hi>enmity</hi> against God, and <hi>obtained</hi> of God to <hi>remit</hi> his <hi>displeasure</hi> against us, he may effect a happy <hi>Reconciliation</hi> between us. <hi>Both</hi> which parts of his Mediation are expressed in those words of the Apostle, Heb. 7.25. <hi>Wherefore he is able to save to the utmost those who come unto God by him,</hi> that is, who by submitting to <hi>him,</hi> as <hi>mediating</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> submit to God <hi>himself, seeing he ever lives to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for them,</hi> or to <hi>Mediate</hi> with God in their <hi>behalf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>belief</hi> of which carries with it the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable <hi>Obligations</hi> to <hi>Christian Piety</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>; but while we look upon Christ as acting only for <hi>one</hi> Party, whether it be for <hi>God</hi> or <hi>our selves,</hi> we do in a great measure <hi>enervate</hi> the <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> For thus while we look upon him as acting only for <hi>God,</hi> that is, as God's <hi>Vicegerent,</hi> we must necessarily conclude that he is concerned only for God's <hi>Authority,</hi> and that when he hath secured or vindicated <hi>that</hi> by <hi>reducing</hi> us to our <hi>duty,</hi> or <hi>punishing</hi> our <hi>disobedience,</hi> he will have no
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58668:18"/>
more to do with <hi>us</hi> or our <hi>concerns,</hi> but even leave us to <hi>shift</hi> for our selves, and to seek our <hi>reward</hi> where we can find it; that he is substituted by his Father for no other end but to <hi>exact</hi> our <hi>Homage,</hi> or <hi>revenge</hi> our <hi>Rebellion,</hi> but that as for <hi>us,</hi> he is no way concerned either to procure us any <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for our <hi>past sin,</hi> or <hi>reward</hi> for our <hi>future</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and while we look upon <hi>him</hi> by whom alone we have access to God, as one that is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>unconcerned</hi> for our welfare, we must look upon <hi>our selves</hi> as <hi>desperate</hi> and <hi>abandoned</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that are utterly forsaken of all <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements.</hi> For what hope can we have, when not only the <hi>Deity</hi> we are to address <hi>to</hi> is highly <hi>offended</hi> at us, but also the <hi>Mediator</hi> we are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress <hi>by</hi> is utterly <hi>regardless</hi> of us? And in such a <hi>hopeless</hi> condition all the <hi>arguments</hi> in the World are <hi>void</hi> and <hi>insignificant.</hi> And so on the other hand, while we look upon Christ as acting only for <hi>us,</hi> that is, as our <hi>Propitiation</hi> and <hi>Advocate</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we must unavoidably conclude that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned only for <hi>our</hi> preservation and happiness; that his Office requires no more of him but only to <hi>pay off</hi> the <hi>scores</hi> of our sins with his bloud, and by <hi>pleading</hi> that payment in Heaven to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our actual <hi>release</hi> from the rigorous demands of divine Justice; in short that he hath nothing else to do but only to <hi>purchase</hi> and <hi>sue</hi> out our pardon, and to <hi>justifie</hi> and set us <hi>right</hi> in the Court of Heaven; but as for reducing us under his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Authority, and subduing our <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> to his <hi>obedience,</hi> that is no part of his <hi>Mediatorship,</hi> nor consequently is he at all <hi>concerned</hi> about it; and if so, all that his <hi>Mediation</hi> can <hi>oblige</hi> us
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58668:18"/>
to (supposing that he hath <hi>effectually</hi> discharged it) is to <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>relie</hi> upon it for our <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Iustification</hi> with God; and if out of pure <hi>grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> we will be <hi>dutiful</hi> and <hi>obedient</hi> to him for the future, he will <hi>kindly</hi> accept it, but if not, he hath no <hi>remedy</hi> against us; and what likelihood is there that any <hi>argument</hi> of Religion should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>prevail</hi> with us to <hi>submit</hi> to the divine <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> so long as we <hi>presume</hi> upon Christ's <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation</hi> for Pardon and Justification <hi>without</hi> it, and believe it to be left wholly to our own <hi>Ingenuity</hi> whether we will submit or no. Thus while we consider Christ's Mediation <hi>by halves,</hi> and mistake <hi>either</hi> part of it for the <hi>whole,</hi> we <hi>pervert</hi> and <hi>deprave</hi> it, and instead of what it <hi>is, viz.</hi> a most <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> inducement to <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> render it an inevitable <hi>temptation</hi> either to <hi>Despair</hi> or <hi>Presumption,</hi> both which are <hi>equally</hi> and <hi>utterly</hi> inconsistent with a <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>Christian Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we consider this Doctrine in its full <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> as it takes in <hi>both</hi> parts of Christ's Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it inforces our <hi>duty</hi> upon us with the most <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> obligations. For it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses it self to every <hi>passion</hi> in us that is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being <hi>moved</hi> and <hi>perswaded,</hi> and at once proposes to our <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> which are the most <hi>vigorous</hi> principles of action, the most <hi>encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi> and <hi>dreadful</hi> considerations. For since his Office obliges him to act for God and men <hi>toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> we may depend upon it, that through the whole course of his Mediation he will be most <hi>just</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> to <hi>both,</hi> and that as on the one hand he will not so act for his Father's <hi>Authority</hi> as to neglect our <hi>safety</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:58668:19"/>
and <hi>welfare,</hi> so neither on the other will he so concern himself for <hi>our</hi> safety and welfare as to expose his <hi>Father</hi>'s Authority; and if he proceed with this exact <hi>equality</hi> between the Parties he acts for, we have all the reason in the World to conclude, that if we <hi>submit</hi> our selves to God we shall be graciously <hi>received</hi> and <hi>rewarded,</hi> but that if we <hi>persist</hi> in our <hi>Rebellion</hi> against him we shall be most severely <hi>punished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For in the first place his being concerned for <hi>us</hi> as well as for <hi>God,</hi> gives us the most ample <hi>security,</hi> that if we will <hi>submit</hi> to his Fathers <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> which he stands ingaged to <hi>secure</hi> or <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,</hi> he will have a most <hi>zealous</hi> regard to <hi>us</hi> and our <hi>concerns,</hi> and be as mindful of <hi>our</hi> interest as if it were his <hi>own.</hi> For in undertaking to be our <hi>Advocate</hi> he assumed our <hi>Persons,</hi> and took our <hi>Affairs</hi> into his <hi>own</hi> hands, so that now he is <hi>another our selves,</hi> and stands obliged to act for us with as much <hi>care</hi> and <hi>concern</hi> as if <hi>our</hi> Persons and Interests were <hi>his</hi>; and therefore we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it that <hi>he</hi> will act as much for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage as we <hi>our selves</hi> could do if we were in <hi>his</hi> place, and had the same <hi>power</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> with his Father that <hi>he</hi> hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that if we were sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>his</hi> room at the right hand of God, and there interceding for <hi>our selves,</hi> we could not justly <hi>wish</hi> for, or <hi>desire</hi> more or greater instances of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> than he will <hi>ask</hi> and <hi>obtain</hi> for us. And what greater encouragement can we have to <hi>return</hi> to our <hi>duty</hi> than <hi>this</hi> very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that all our concerns with our <hi>offended</hi> God are <hi>deposited</hi> in the hands of a most <hi>faithful</hi> Mediator, who upon our return will concern
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58668:19"/>
himself as <hi>zealously</hi> for <hi>our</hi> Good as for his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s Authority, and <hi>solicit</hi> our cause in the Court of Heaven as <hi>Industriously</hi> as we <hi>our selves</hi> could do if we were admitted to be our <hi>own</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates? But then in the second place his being concerned for his <hi>Father</hi>'s Authority as well as for <hi>our</hi> Interest, gives us as full <hi>assurance,</hi> on the other hand, that he is no <hi>less</hi> obliged by his Office to <hi>reduce</hi> us to our <hi>duty</hi> to his Father, or <hi>avenge</hi> him upon us for our <hi>disobedience</hi> than he is to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store</hi> us to his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi>; and if he should so attempt the <hi>later</hi> as to be any way deficient in the <hi>former,</hi> he would not perform the part of a <hi>just</hi> Mediator, which consists in acting <hi>impartially</hi> for <hi>both</hi> Parties. For should he favour our <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> beyond his Father's <hi>Authority,</hi> he would be so far partial to <hi>us</hi> against his <hi>Father.</hi> Now though he loved us so <hi>well</hi> as to <hi>sacrifice</hi> his <hi>life</hi> for us on <hi>Earth,</hi> and in the vertue of that Sacrifice to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear our <hi>Advocate</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet we can never be so <hi>fond</hi> sure as to imagine that he loves us <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> than his own <hi>Father</hi>; and if he doth not, we may build upon it that he is as <hi>zealously</hi> concerned to <hi>assert</hi> his Authority as to <hi>prosecute</hi> our interest, and to <hi>provide</hi> that he be <hi>obeyed</hi> or <hi>avenged</hi> as that we be <hi>pardoned</hi> and <hi>rewarded</hi>; but for us to <hi>rely</hi> upon Christ as mediating for <hi>us,</hi> without <hi>submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> to him as mediating for <hi>God,</hi> is in effect to hope that he will be so <hi>exceeding</hi> gracious to us as to <hi>betray</hi> his Father's <hi>trust</hi> for <hi>our</hi> sake, and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <hi>his</hi> authority to <hi>our</hi> safety. For should he <hi>take</hi> our <hi>part</hi> with God, and <hi>solicite</hi> him to <hi>favour</hi> us while we <hi>persist</hi> in our <hi>rebellions</hi> against him, he would in effect abandon the <hi>cause</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> of

Whilst therefore we obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>refuse</hi> to hearken to him in his Mediation for <hi>God,</hi> that is, to <hi>submit</hi> to his <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>return</hi> to our <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>allegiance,</hi> he will be so far from interceding <hi>for</hi> us in the <hi>vertue</hi> of his <hi>meritorious sacrifice,</hi> that he will appear <hi>against</hi> us as an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed</hi> Judge in the <hi>quarrel</hi> of his Father's <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and <hi>dearly</hi> revenge upon our <hi>guilty</hi> heads all those shameless <hi>affronts</hi> and <hi>indignities</hi> we have offered it, and by making us <hi>everlasting</hi> Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his <hi>Vengeance,</hi> convince us by <hi>woful</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that he is no less a <hi>just</hi> Mediator for <hi>God</hi> than a <hi>merciful</hi> Mediator for <hi>Men.</hi> So that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to <hi>persist</hi> in our <hi>rebellion</hi> against <hi>God,</hi> we do in effect <hi>renounce</hi> the <hi>Mediation</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and <hi>proclaim</hi> before God and Angels that we will not be <hi>beholden</hi> to the <hi>one</hi> and <hi>only</hi> Advocate of sinners. And when we have flung our selves out of <hi>this</hi> Protection, Lord! whither shall we <hi>go</hi> for <hi>sanctuary</hi> from thy vengeance? When there is but this <hi>one</hi> Mediator and <hi>he</hi> hath <hi>discarded</hi> me, O my wretched Soul, whither wilt thou <hi>betake</hi> thy self? <hi>Call now and see if there be any will hear thee, to which of all the Saints or Angels wilt thou turn thee?</hi> What <hi>Favourite</hi> of Heaven will <hi>plead</hi> thy <hi>cause</hi> when the <hi>only</hi> Advocate of Souls hath <hi>reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> thee? For if he who is my <hi>only</hi> Mediator, be <hi>incensed</hi> against me, who shall <hi>Mediate</hi> between <hi>me</hi> and <hi>him?</hi> When God <hi>alone</hi> was <hi>angry</hi> with me, there was some hope, because my <hi>Saviour</hi> stands as a living Screen between <hi>me</hi> and <hi>his</hi> displeasure, to <hi>guard</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> me from it; but when <hi>that</hi>

is kindled against me too, what is there to <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> between me and the devouring flame? <hi>Be wise therefore,</hi> O ye sinners, <hi>be instructed,</hi> ye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate Rebels against God; <hi>Kiss the Son lest he be angry and ye perish from the way; for if his wrath be kindled but a little, blessed are all they that put their trust in him,</hi> but Wo be to them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him.</p>
               <p>Thus the Mediation of Christ <hi>addresses</hi> to our <hi>fear</hi> as well as <hi>hope,</hi> in order to the <hi>subduing</hi> us to the Will of God, and <hi>presses</hi> at once upon <hi>both</hi> these great Avenues of our Souls with the most <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible</hi> Motives.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That this his Mediation proceeds upon certain <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>stipulations</hi> between God and Men, which he <hi>obtained</hi> of God for us, and in his name hath <hi>published</hi> and <hi>tendered</hi> to us. For when Mankind, by reason of the <hi>degeneracy</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, were cut off from all <hi>immediate</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse with God, and this most <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Method of conversing with us by a <hi>Mediator</hi> was resolved on by the Divine Council, God, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of what our Mediator had <hi>ingaged</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>suffer</hi> for us <hi>in the fulness of time,</hi> granted to him in our behalf a most <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Covenant, whereby he ingaged himself to <hi>bestow</hi> his <hi>spirit</hi> upon us to <hi>inable</hi> us to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>return</hi> to him, upon condition that we should <hi>seek</hi> it, and <hi>co-operate</hi> with it; to <hi>pardon</hi> all our <hi>past</hi> sins, upon condition that we should unfeignedly <hi>repent</hi> of them; and to <hi>crown</hi> us with <hi>eternal life,</hi> upon condition we should <hi>persevere</hi> to the end in <hi>well-doing.</hi> This is the substance of that <hi>gracious</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which God hath <hi>granted</hi> to us for the <hi>sake</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:58668:21"/>
of our Mediator; who hath accordingly assured us from God, that he <hi>will give his holy Spirit unto them that ask,</hi> Luke 11.13. That if <hi>we will repent and be converted, our sins shall be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord,</hi> Acts 5.19. And that <hi>if we will be faithful to the death we shall receive a Crown of life,</hi> Rev. 2.10. And upon this <hi>Covenant</hi> it is that our blessed Saviour proceeds in his <hi>Mediation</hi> between God and Men. For our <hi>Baptismal Vow</hi> is nothing else but only a <hi>solemn</hi> engagement of our selves to <hi>perform</hi> the <hi>condition</hi> of this Covenant, upon which there results to us a <hi>conditional</hi> right to all that God hath <hi>promised</hi> in it; and when by this <hi>fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> solemnity of Baptism <hi>God</hi> and <hi>we</hi> have once <hi>obliged</hi> our selves to <hi>each other,</hi> by mutual <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>engagements,</hi> Christ's Office, as <hi>Mediator</hi> between us, is to solicite on <hi>both</hi> sides for mutual <hi>performance</hi>; and accordingly in Mediating for <hi>God</hi> with <hi>us,</hi> he <hi>requires</hi> nothing of <hi>us</hi> but what we promised to <hi>God,</hi> and in mediating for <hi>us</hi> with <hi>God</hi> he <hi>claims</hi> nothing of <hi>God</hi> but what God promised to <hi>us.</hi> And hence he is called, <hi>The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of this better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8.6. and <hi>The Mediator of the new Covenant,</hi> Heb. 12.24. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he transacts between <hi>both</hi> Parties to solicite the <hi>performance</hi> of their <hi>mutual</hi> engagements. For so the same Author in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, 15. seems to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it, <hi>How much more,</hi> saith he (having spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the vertue of the bloud of Bulls and Goats) <hi>shall the bloud of Christ, who through the eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit offered himself without spot to God, purge our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences from dead Works to serve the living God; and for this cause he is the Mediator of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58668:21"/>
that by means of death for the Redemption of transgressions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they which are called might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promise of eternal Inheritance</hi>; where those words [and for this cause] seem as well to refer to what went <hi>before</hi> as to what <hi>follows,</hi> and then the sence will be this, <hi>For this cause he is the Mediator of the New Covenant,</hi> both that he might take care <hi>that our Consciences being purged from dead works we might serve the living God,</hi> and that having redeemed us by his Death, <hi>we might receive the promise of eternal Inheritance.</hi> And accordingly he proceeds in his Mediation; for in acting for <hi>God</hi> as his <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Vicegerent,</hi> he hath <hi>enacted</hi> the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> which this Covenant <hi>requires</hi> of us into the <hi>Laws</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>exacts</hi> them of us under the <hi>fearful</hi> Penalty of <hi>eternal Damnation</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath taken <hi>effectual</hi> care that we shall either <hi>perform</hi> these <hi>conditions,</hi> or undergo a punishment as great as the guilt of our neglect and contempt of them; and having thus tied them upon us by the <hi>utmost</hi> force of <hi>Law,</hi> that is, by Law established on the most <hi>dreadful</hi> Penalty, he hath, so far as his Regal Authority extends, compelled us to the <hi>performance</hi> of <hi>our</hi> part of this Covenant; so that if we do <hi>not</hi> perform it, it is not to be attributed to any <hi>neglect</hi> or <hi>omission</hi> of the Mediator, who to <hi>oblige</hi> us to perform it hath most <hi>faithfully</hi> acted for <hi>God,</hi> even to the utmost extent of that power wherewithal he <hi>invested</hi> him.</p>
               <p>And so on the other hand, in acting for <hi>us</hi> as our <hi>Intercessor,</hi> he hath taken no less care to insure <hi>God's</hi> part of this Covenant to <hi>us</hi> than he did to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <hi>our</hi> part of it to <hi>God.</hi> For this Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted to us by God in <hi>consideration</hi> of a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58668:22"/>
                  <hi>valuable satisfaction</hi> for our <hi>sins,</hi> Christ hath not only <hi>rendered</hi> this satisfaction to God by <hi>dying</hi> for us, and thereby <hi>purchased</hi> for us a just <hi>right</hi> and <hi>claim</hi> to all the <hi>blessings</hi> which God hath <hi>promised</hi> on <hi>his</hi> part if we <hi>perform</hi> what he <hi>requires</hi> on <hi>ours,</hi> but in the <hi>vertue</hi> of this satisfaction he also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears for us at the right hand of God, there to <hi>plead</hi> our <hi>right,</hi> and to <hi>prefer</hi> our <hi>claim,</hi> by exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that <hi>vocal</hi> Bloud, and those importunate Wounds with the price of which he purchased and obtained it. So that now we are intitled to all the <hi>blessings</hi> of this Covenant, not only by God's <hi>Promise,</hi> but by Christ's <hi>Purchace</hi> too, and to secure both, we have Christ himself <hi>advocating</hi> for us in Heaven with the price of that Purchace in his <hi>hands.</hi> So effectually hath he transacted for us in his Mediation with God in <hi>our</hi> behalf, that we have the highest security imaginable, that if we perform <hi>our</hi> part of this Covenant, God will not fail to perform <hi>his</hi>; since in so doing he would not only violate his own <hi>truth</hi> which he hath engaged to us by <hi>promise,</hi> but also injuriously defraud his own Son of what he hath duly <hi>purchased</hi> for us by his <hi>Death,</hi> and claims upon that Purchace by his <hi>Intercession.</hi> For he <hi>intercedes</hi> for no other bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings in our behalf but what he <hi>purchased</hi> for us upon a consideration that was not only infinitely <hi>valuable</hi> in it self, but also freely <hi>accepted</hi> by his Father; and he purchased no other blessings for us but what are specified in <hi>this</hi> gracious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; so that he asks nothing for us but what he hath a right to obtain, nothing but what he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by his <hi>bloud,</hi> and is in strict Justice <hi>due</hi> to his <hi>meritoriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58668:22"/>
that his Father can deny him without doing him the most outragious wrong and injury; and therefore this we may be as confident of as we can be of any thing in the World, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath <hi>purchased</hi> for us he will not fail to <hi>ask,</hi> and that whatsoever he asks he will be sure to <hi>obtain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Christ by his Mediation between God and Men hath taken the most effectual care to insure the <hi>mutual</hi> performance of this everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to both Parties. For to insure <hi>God</hi> of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming <hi>our</hi> part, he hath bound it upon us by a Law enforced with an everlasting Penalty; which is the strongest obligation he could lay upon us; And to insure <hi>us</hi> of God's performing <hi>his</hi> part, he duly <hi>purchased</hi> it for us by his <hi>Death,</hi> and in vertue of that just Right he ever lives to claim it by his <hi>Intercession,</hi> which is the strongest obligation he could lay upon God; so that now, as God cannot fail in <hi>his</hi> part without violating his Truth and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, which would be to destroy his own Being, and <hi>un-god</hi> himself, so neither we can in <hi>ours</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exposing our everlasting well-being, and plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves body and soul together into everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wretchedness and calamity. And hence I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it is that our Saviour is called <hi>the surety of a better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 7.22. or, as the Greek word may be rendered, the <hi>Trustee</hi> between both Parties, to see that they <hi>mutually</hi> perform their <hi>several</hi> parts of this Covenant to each other; which Office our blessed Lord hath faithfully performed, in that he hath taken the utmost care to oblige both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>us</hi> mutually to make good our several engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to each other. For though he hath not

this inward and spiritual Government rests, challenges to himself this <hi>divine Prerogative</hi> which is so necessary a qualification for it; <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23. <hi>And all the Churches shall know,</hi> saith he, <hi>that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts, and will give to every one of you according to his works.</hi> Nor is it less requisite to qualifie him for this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Empire that he should be Almighty than that he should be Omniscient; for to enable him to rule the hearts and souls of men it is necessary that he should have the Command and Disposal of all those outward Events and Accidents in which they are any way concerned, since it is by these in a great measure that their hearts are swayed, their affections formed, their intentions and resolutions squared and regulated, and in a word, their good and evil actions rewarded and punished in this World; and to wield and manage, moderate and dispose such infinite numbers of Events as concern such infinite numbers of Men so vastly distant from one another in place, condition, and temper, requires a power that can <hi>do whatsoever it pleases both in Heaven and Earth,</hi> which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates to the <hi>divine Power</hi> as its peculiar <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,</hi> Psal. 135.6, 7. and if it be only a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power that can manage and dispose all the affairs of all men, what can be more requisite than that he who rules and governs them should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of the divine Omnipotence? And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly our Saviour, upon whom this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is devolved, assures his Disciples that <hi>all power was communicated to him both in Heaven and Earth,</hi> Matt. 28.18. which being the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the <hi>divine Power</hi> seems impossible to have been
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58668:25"/>
communicated to any but a <hi>divine Person.</hi> And therefore the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> speaking of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christ, tells us, that his name <hi>should be called Wonderful, Counsellour, the mighty God, Isa.</hi> 9.6. where by <hi>Counsellour</hi> and <hi>mighty God</hi> he seems to design his infinite <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> whereby he should be qualified for this his <hi>divine</hi> Government; for so <hi>Mighty God</hi> doth always in the Scripture-phrase signifie <hi>Almighty God</hi>; so in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.1. <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.18. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.12. and elsewhere. By all which it is evident, that to Mediate <hi>Authoritatively</hi> for God with men is a Province so <hi>sublime</hi> as that it requires no less than <hi>divine</hi> perfections in the Person that <hi>undertakes</hi> and <hi>manages</hi> it, and consequently that it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site he should be <hi>God.</hi>

gives him such Stiles and Characters, as cannot without <hi>extreme</hi> force be applied to any but a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>divine</hi>; he stiles him <hi>The brightness of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Glory, and the express Image of his Person</hi>; the <hi>Founder</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Maker</hi> of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and the <hi>Vpholder of all things by the word of his power,</hi> Vers. 3.10. he tells us, that he was set <hi>far above the Angels,</hi> and that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ordered <hi>all his Angels to worship him,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring him to be God in these terms, <hi>Thy Throne O God is for ever and ever</hi>; and then he concludes all with this application, <hi>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard of him,</hi> Chap. 2. v. 1. which shews that in the Apostle's sense to Mediate for God is a station so <hi>sublime</hi> that it was very fit it <hi>should</hi> be supplied (as it <hi>was</hi>) with a Person of the <hi>highest Dignity,</hi> that so his <hi>Person</hi> might <hi>reflect</hi> a Majesty on his <hi>Office,</hi> and render it more <hi>awful</hi> and <hi>venerable</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>And as to accomplish him for this high Office of Mediating for God with Men, it was most fit he should be <hi>God,</hi> so it was no less requisite he should be <hi>Man.</hi> For Man being naturally a <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> as well as a <hi>rational</hi> Creature, in this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi> state of his nature, wherein his sensitive part is <hi>predominant,</hi> there are no sorts of objects do so vigorously <hi>impress</hi> and <hi>affect</hi> him, as those which strike immediately on his <hi>senses</hi>; and hence it is that he so greedily prefers <hi>carnal</hi> before <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi> and <hi>sensitive</hi> before <hi>spiritual</hi> goods, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the <hi>later</hi> are in themselves infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>eligible,</hi> and that in his conceptions of <hi>spiritual</hi> objects he is so prone to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58668:26"/>
                  <hi>blend</hi> and <hi>intermix</hi> them with <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi> Phantasms, because his mind is so <hi>estranged</hi> from spiritual objects by its continual <hi>intimacy</hi> and <hi>familiarity</hi> with sensual ones, that it can hardly frame any <hi>Idea</hi> of them without <hi>disguising</hi> them into some <hi>bodily</hi> semblance. God therefore being a <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>invisible</hi> Essence, and upon this account far removed out of the <hi>Ken</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> of our sense, our <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>depraved</hi> minds must either be naturally indisposed to think seriously of, and consequently to be duly affected by him, which renders us prone to <hi>Irreligion,</hi> or to <hi>sophisticate</hi> our conceptions of him with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Phantasms</hi> which renders us prone to <hi>Idolatry</hi>; to prevent both which God in great condescension to this deplorable weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of humane minds hath always thought meet to converse with us under some <hi>sensible</hi> appearance or <hi>visible</hi> Symbol of his <hi>Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi> Thus when God conducted his Chosen People through the <hi>Red Sea</hi> and <hi>Wilderness,</hi> he went before them in a <hi>Pillar of Cloud by day,</hi> and <hi>in a Pillar of Fire by night,</hi> and when afterwards he gave them his <hi>Law,</hi> he descended upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in a <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> flame, overcast with <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>solemn</hi> clouds, in which <hi>illustrious</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance he afterwards made his entrance into the Tabernacle, where he made his constant abode, and from whence he frequently exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himself to the Peoples <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>senses</hi> in a body of <hi>visible light</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> which visible light is in holy Scripture very often called the <hi>Glory of the Lord.</hi> And since God in condescension to the <hi>weakness</hi> of humane minds thought it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58668:26"/>
meet to present himself to the <hi>senses</hi> of men in some <hi>visible</hi> appearance, there is the same reason why the Mediator should assume some <hi>visible substance</hi> to his <hi>invisible Godhead,</hi> that therein he might exhibit himself to our <hi>sense,</hi> and thereby at once affect our minds with a great <hi>love</hi> and <hi>dread</hi> of his divine Majesty, and by vouchsafing us a <hi>visible presence</hi> prevent our fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>false Images,</hi> and <hi>Representations</hi> of him in our own minds. Now of all <hi>sensible</hi> substance there was none so proper for this end as <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> which is that above all others that we are most <hi>intimately</hi> acquainted with and most <hi>accustomed</hi> to <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>reverence,</hi> and <hi>obey.</hi> It is true, had his design been to Govern us by <hi>terrors</hi> and <hi>affrightments,</hi> as he did the <hi>Iews,</hi> it would have been more proper for him to assume that dreadful appearance of a <hi>consuming fire,</hi> in which he was wont to converse with <hi>them</hi>; but his design being to erect his <hi>Empire</hi> in mens <hi>Souls,</hi> and to <hi>captivate</hi> their <hi>Wills</hi> into a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> obedience, he could not have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in any visible substance so proper for <hi>this</hi> end, so apt to <hi>oblige</hi> and <hi>aw,</hi> to <hi>indear</hi> and <hi>terrifie</hi> us together, as <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> And accordingly as God dwelt of old in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Tabernacle, and thence <hi>displayed</hi> himself before the <hi>Eyes</hi> of that People in a visible Glory; so <hi>the Word,</hi> as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells, <hi>was made flesh, and tabernacled among us,</hi> (for so the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies,) <hi>i. e.</hi> as in condescension to the weakness of the <hi>Iews</hi> he pitched his Tabernacle among them, and thence frequently <hi>appeared</hi> in a visible Glory to their <hi>sense,</hi> so in condescension
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58668:27"/>
to ours he pitched his Tabernacle in our flesh or nature, from whence, as he proceeds, <hi>we behold his Glory (i. e.</hi> at his Baptism and Transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>as the glory of the only begotten Son,</hi> or in which the only begotten Son was wont to <hi>display</hi> himself from between the <hi>Cherubins, Iohn</hi> 1.14. In short therefore since in Mediating for God with us it was very needful that in compliance with our weakness he should address to our sense in some visible appearance, and since there was no visible appearance in which he could so advantagiously address to us as that of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> it hence evidently appears how requisite it was that he should assume our Nature to his Deity, and be Man as well as God.</p>
               <p>And as it was requisite he should be <hi>God-man</hi> in order to his Mediating for <hi>God</hi> with <hi>us,</hi> so was it also no less requisite in order to his Mediating for <hi>us</hi> with <hi>God</hi>; because, as I shall shew hereafter, to Mediate for us with God implies, first, his making an <hi>atonement</hi> for our <hi>sins</hi> with his <hi>Bloud</hi>; Secondly, his appearing for us as our Advocate in Heaven. Now as for the first, it was highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that he should be Man, that so he might <hi>suffer</hi> for us, his Divinity being wholly impas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; and this reason the Apostle himself assigns, Heb. 2.14. <hi>Forasmuch then as the Children are partakers of flesh and bloud, he also himself</hi> (speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ) <hi>took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him who hath the power of death</hi>; and seeing he was to assume another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to his Divinity, that so he might suffer for us, it was most fit and proper that he should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume <hi>ours</hi> rather than any <hi>other.</hi> For since God
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58668:27"/>
in mercy had consented to accept of <hi>another</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's suffering for <hi>our</hi> sins, it was very requisite that what he suffered for us should come as near to our own personal suffering as it was possible, that so it might be more exemplary to us, and more nearly affect us with dread and horrour for our sins; and next to our own personal suffering is the suffering of our Nature: and therefore since the punishment of our sins was to be transferred from our Persons, it was highly fit it should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on our Nature, which it could not have been had not he been Man who endured it.</p>
               <p>And as it was requisite that he should be Man, that so he might suffer, and that so the Nature at least that had sinned might suffer, so it was no less requisite that he should be <hi>God-man</hi> in one and the same person; to render his sufferings a valuable Consideration for all that Punishment that was due to God upon the score of the infinite sins of an infinite number of sinners. For how could the bloud of one man, though never so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent or excellent, have amounted to a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able commutation for the forfeited lives and souls of a world of guilty sinners? Or what less than the bloud of <hi>God-man</hi> could have been any way equivalent to that Eternal Punishment that was due to God from the whole Race of Mankind? And yet that it should be in some measure equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent was highly requisite, as I shall shew hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both to satisfie the divine <hi>Iustice</hi> for what is past, and to secure the divine Authority for the future; and accordingly we are said to be <hi>purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the bloud of God,</hi> Acts 20.28. not that the Divine Essence can suffer or bleed, but being
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58668:28"/>
united into one Person with the Humane Nature, the Properties of this Nature, and also the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Passions thence proceeding, may be truly attributed to it; and therefore since in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ God was united to Man, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Humanity suffered may be truly called the suffering of God; and being so, it was a suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every way equivalent to the Eternal damnation of the whole world of sinners.</p>
               <p>Lastly, As he was to appear as our Advocate at the right hand of God, it was very fit he should be Man, that so, as the Apostle discourses, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an High Priest that was in all points tempted like as we are,</hi> as having been placed in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Circumstances, he might be the more affectionately <hi>touched with the feeling of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> Heb. 4.15. <hi>i. e.</hi> that so our nature being a part of himself, and that himself having experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced its weakness and infirmity, he might be the more nearly concerned for it, and be touched with a more tender compassion towards it, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently solicite its cause and interest at the right hand of God with greater zeal and importunity. For so the same Author reasons, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the People, for in that himself hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that he should be God as well as Man is no less requisite to create in us the greater confidence of the success of his Advocation. For what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Argument could be great enough to satisfie
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58668:28"/>
our guilty, and therefore anxious minds, that ever a meer man, who had nothing beyond our selves to recommend him to God but only his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Vertue, should be able to obtain such a prevailing interest in Heaven, as not only to reconcile the Almighty Father of all things to a world of sinful men, against whom he was so justly and so highly incensed, but also to obtain of him to imbrace them with infinite Love, and crown them with eternal Favours; which is such a stupendous success as we could scarce have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly hoped for from the most importunate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, not only of the best man that ever was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, but of the highest Angel in Heaven? For unless we could reasonably suppose God to be more pleased with one innocent man or Angel than he is displeased with a world of guilty sinners, which is hardly supposable, we could have no just ground to hope that the cries of the ones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions should be more prevalent with him than the cries of the others guilts. But when we consider, that he who hath undertaken our cause is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the Son of his <hi>natural Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> that from all Eternity was begotten of his <hi>Essence, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God,</hi> what may we not expect from the Prayers of one so near and dear to the Eternal Father, that is fit either for him to ask, or for the Eternal Father to bestow? For this we may be confident of, that he can never be so highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with us as he is pleased with his own Son, who is the stamp of his very Essence, and express Character of his Person, and that therefore his pleasure in him will be far more prevalent than

all his displeasure against us; and while it is so, we have all the security in the world that he will succeed in his Advocation, and prevail in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. Thus that Christ should be <hi>God-man</hi> was in it self highly expedient to qualifie him for all the Parts and Offices of his Mediation, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the holy Scripture expresly declares him to be so.</p>
               <p>For first, That he is God is as plainly asserted as any Proposition in the Bible.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58668:29"/>
something greater than a <hi>Nominal</hi> or <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Deity,</hi> which our Adversaries in this Article allow was frequently given to the <hi>Angel of the Lord</hi> in the Old Testament. If therefore that Angel of the Lord were a meer created Angel, as they affirm, he had as much attributed to him as our <hi>Saviour,</hi> unless we suppose this stile, <hi>O God,</hi> to import real and essential <hi>Deity,</hi> and not meerly <hi>nominal.</hi> So also <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> For the clearing of which noble Text, which our Adversaries with a world of Art have indeavoured to perplex and intangle, it is to be considered that this Phrase, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:58668:30"/>Now it is hardly to be imagined by any one whose mind is not deeply tinctured with <hi>Heretical Pravity,</hi> but that had the Apostle used this Tech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nological Phrase in any <hi>different</hi> sence from its common acceptation, he would have told us of it, and not have given us such an unavoidable occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to mistake in so great a Doctrine, by clothing its sence in such Phrases as in the Language of the Age he wrote in signified so <hi>differently</hi> from what he <hi>meant</hi> and <hi>intended</hi> by them.</p>
               <p>And as in the above-named Texts he is expresly stiled <hi>God,</hi> so other Texts, to convince us that he is not a meer <hi>titular</hi> Deity, attribute sundry things to him which are peculiar to God <hi>Essential.</hi> For so the <hi>making of the World</hi> is in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces expresly attributed to him, (which as the Apostle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.4. is peculiar to God; <hi>For he,</hi> saith he, <hi>that made all things is God</hi>;) for so in the above-named Text we are told, <hi>That by him were all things made, and that without him was not any thing made which was made</hi>; where by <hi>all things</hi> we must necessarily understand the <hi>whole World,</hi> unless we will suppose the Apostle to <hi>equivocate,</hi> because it was then a common and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Doctrine that <hi>the Word</hi> was the <hi>maker of the World.</hi> For so, besides the above-cited Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase upon <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.12. instead of <hi>I made the Earth, and created man upon it, saith the Lord,</hi> renders it, <hi>I by my word made the Earth, and created man upon it</hi>; and on <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. instead of <hi>God created man,</hi> the <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem Targum</hi> renders it, <hi>The Word of the Lord created man,</hi> and so in several other places. This therefore being the Doctrine of the Age, <hi>S. Iohn</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:58668:30"/>
could not but apprehend that they would certainly understand these words of his in their own sence, because in all appearance they are so to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; if therefore he meant them in any other sence, he ought immediately to have explained himself, which since he hath not, it is plain either that he meant according to the <hi>common</hi> sence, or that he intended to <hi>equivocate</hi>; but that he meant according to the common Doctrine of the Age is sufficiently evident from other Texts of Scripture. For <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. the Apostle expresses this Article to the Jews in their own Language, <hi>through Faith we understand that the Worlds were made by the Word of God</hi>; now that by this <hi>Word</hi> he meant <hi>Christ,</hi> is plain from <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>In these last days God spake unto us by his own Son, by whom also he made the Worlds</hi>; and that by these <hi>Worlds</hi> he means the <hi>whole Creation</hi> is evident from the 8, 9, and 10. verses of this Chapter, <hi>But unto the Son he said, thy Throne O God is for ever and ever,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. speaking still of the <hi>Son,</hi> and then it follows, <hi>And thou Lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of thine hands</hi>; for the conjunction (<hi>And</hi>) here plainly connects these words to the foregoing, <hi>viz. But unto the Son he said,</hi> &amp;c. so that still it is the same <hi>Son</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>Thy Throne O God,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>thou Lord in the beginning,</hi> &amp;c. the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>whose Throne</hi> in verse 8. is said to <hi>be for ever and ever,</hi> that is said in verse 10. to have <hi>laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the earth.</hi> So also <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. <hi>Who is the Image of the invisible God, the first-born of every Creature, for by him were all things created
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58668:31"/>
that are in Heaven, and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be Thrones, or Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Principalities, or Powers, all things were created by him, and for him, and he is before all things, and by him all things do consist</hi>; where to shew that he means a proper and literal creation, the Apostle describes it in those very words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Moses</hi> describes the creation of the World, <hi>For by him were all things created that are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that are on Earth</hi>; and to shew that he doth not mean by creating, <hi>renewing</hi> or <hi>regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> as the <hi>Socinians</hi> will needs understand him, he tells us, that not only <hi>Men</hi> were created by him, who are the only Subjects of this new <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical</hi> creation, but <hi>all things</hi> in general <hi>that are on Earth,</hi> and not only all things that are on Earth, but <hi>all things that are in Heaven</hi> too, where there never was any thing <hi>new-created</hi> or <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi>; for the <hi>Thrones and Dominions, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers, i. e.</hi> Orders of Angels that are here said to be created by him have never been <hi>renewed</hi> or <hi>regenerated,</hi> but those of them that <hi>fell</hi> fell for <hi>all eternity,</hi> and they which <hi>stand</hi> have <hi>always</hi> stood, and shall stand <hi>for ever</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his <hi>creating</hi> them must be meant his giving them their <hi>being</hi> and <hi>existence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the creation of the World is in Scripture attributed to Christ, which speaks him a <hi>divine Being,</hi> so there are other things ascribed to him which are <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>Divinity,</hi> as particularly his being <hi>Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last,</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.13. and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other places, which is a stile that God hath appropriated to himself, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.6. <hi>Thus saith
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58668:31"/>
the Lord the King of Israel, and his Redeemer the Lord of Hosts, I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no God.</hi> If then Christ be <hi>the first and last,</hi> as he himself declares he is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.17. he must be that <hi>Lord the King and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto we have been proving that he is <hi>God,</hi> but then there are other Texts that do as plainly prove him to be <hi>God-man.</hi> For so in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Without controversie great is the mystery of Godliness, God was manifested in the flesh,</hi> which is the same with that of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> John 1.18. <hi>And the Word</hi> (which in the first verse he saith <hi>was God) was made flesh</hi>; so also <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the form of God he thought it not Robbery to be equal with God, but emptied himself, and took upon him the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men</hi>; from which words it is plain that Christ was <hi>in the form of God</hi> before ever he was <hi>in the form of a servant,</hi> for it was by taking on him the form of a Servant that <hi>he emptied himself,</hi> and his being in the form of a servant consisted in being <hi>made in the likeness of men,</hi> so that his being in the form of God doth as much imply that he was <hi>God,</hi> as his being in the form of a servant doth that he was <hi>Man,</hi> and since in becoming man he <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied</hi> himself, it necessarily follows, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he became so he was <hi>full,</hi> and also that that fulness of his consisted in being in the form of God; if then he was full by being in the form of God, before he emptied himself into the form of a servant by being made in the likeness of men, it is certain that he was in the form of God <hi>before</hi> he was in the form of man, and that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58668:32"/>
his being in the form of God doth as much signifie his being <hi>really</hi> God as his being in the form of men doth his being <hi>really</hi> man: But for further satisfaction concerning these two last cited Texts I refer the Reader to that most learned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Treatise, <hi>Pearson</hi>'s Exposition of the Creed, <hi>fol.</hi> 121, and 127. where the Cavils of the <hi>Socinians</hi> are all shamefully baffled with clear and convincing reasons.</p>
               <p>Thus as it is highly requisite in it self that the Mediator should partake of the Natures of both the Parties between whom he interposes, so we are sufficiently assured that he doth, by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Testimony. So that now in his Mediation for <hi>God</hi> with <hi>us</hi> we have all the reason in the world to dread and reverence his Authority, and also to resign up our selves to its conduct with a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>chearful</hi> mind. For being <hi>God,</hi> we are sure that he hath an <hi>all-seeing</hi> Eye that <hi>inspects</hi> our hearts, and <hi>pries</hi> into the inmost thoughts and purposes of our Souls, and an <hi>Almighty</hi> Arm that can <hi>stretch forth</hi> it self to the remotest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and <hi>reach</hi> us even to the bottomless Pit; and being thus exposed to the <hi>inspection</hi> of an all-seeing Eye, and the <hi>vengeance</hi> of an Almighty Arm, how <hi>dare</hi> we harbour any <hi>thought</hi> or <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi> any <hi>desire</hi> or <hi>affection</hi> with which that Eye is offended, or that Arm provoked? But then being <hi>Man</hi> as well as God, his Authority comes armed to us with equal <hi>Sweetness</hi> and <hi>Majesty,</hi> and is every whit as apt to affect our <hi>love</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,</hi> as our <hi>dread</hi> and <hi>reverence.</hi> For how can we refuse to <hi>obey</hi> him when he commands us in our <hi>own nature</hi>; a nature which is most <hi>intimate</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:58668:32"/>
and <hi>familiar</hi> to us, and which we are most inured to <hi>love</hi> and to <hi>obey</hi>; and above all, a nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he <hi>bled</hi> and <hi>died</hi> for us, and chearfully exposed himself to <hi>sorrow,</hi> and <hi>shame,</hi> and <hi>torment,</hi> that we might <hi>live</hi> and be <hi>happy</hi> for ever? And so on the other hand, in his Mediation for <hi>us</hi> with <hi>God</hi> we have all the reason in the World <hi>stedfastly</hi> to relie upon his <hi>meritorious</hi> Sacrifice and <hi>powerful</hi> Intercession; for as he was <hi>man,</hi> he was not only <hi>capacitated</hi> to suffer for us, but he <hi>actually</hi> suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>our nature,</hi> that very nature wherein <hi>we</hi> had justly deserved to suffer for ever. So that what <hi>he</hi> suffered for us came as near to <hi>our</hi> suffering for our selves, and consequently did as much satisfie the <hi>ends</hi> of divine Justice in exacting <hi>punishment</hi> of Offenders, as it was possible for any <hi>substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> or <hi>vicarious</hi> punishment to do. For though our <hi>persons</hi> escape, our <hi>nature</hi> hath been punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>him.</hi> But then being <hi>God</hi> as well as Man, what <hi>he</hi> suffered for us was not only <hi>instead</hi> of what <hi>we</hi> ought to have suffered, but <hi>equivalent</hi> to it. So that our <hi>ransom</hi> from eternal punishment being <hi>paid</hi> with the bloud of one of our <hi>own</hi> kind, <hi>hypostatically</hi> united to <hi>God,</hi> we did as much suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in <hi>him</hi> as we <hi>could</hi> do without suffering in our <hi>own persons,</hi> and what we suffered in him was every way <hi>equivalent</hi> to what we had <hi>deserved</hi> to suffer in our own persons. So that now we have all possible assurance that the Divine Justice is so far <hi>satisfied</hi> by what Christ hath suffered for our sins, that if we <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>forsake</hi> them, we shall be freely <hi>discharged</hi> from all that infinite <hi>Debt</hi> of punishment which we have justly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted</hi> by them. And then again being <hi>Man,</hi> we
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58668:33"/>
may be secure that he hath a most <hi>tender</hi> sympathy with the whole Mass of <hi>humane nature</hi> by what distances soever of time or place <hi>divided</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd,</hi> and consequently that having in himself experienced its <hi>weaknesses</hi> and <hi>temptations,</hi> so far as was consistent with his <hi>innocence,</hi> he must needs be a very <hi>concerned</hi> and <hi>zealous</hi> Advocate for us with the Almighty Father. And then being <hi>God-man,</hi> the Son of the Almighty <hi>Father</hi>'s <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> as well as the Son of <hi>man,</hi> we may be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly secure that he cannot <hi>fail</hi> being <hi>successful</hi> in his <hi>Advocation,</hi> especially when he pleads for us, as he <hi>doth</hi> in the <hi>right</hi> of his own <hi>meritorious</hi> Bloud by which he <hi>purchased</hi> our admission into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour.</hi> So that considering all these things, it is evident that there could have been no Mediator between God and us so every way <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> to govern us <hi>for</hi> God, and intercede for us <hi>with</hi> God, none in whom both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>we</hi> could have reposed that <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,</hi> as a <hi>Theanthropos</hi> or God-man.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Another thing which the Scripture propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to our belief concerning this Mediator, is that as he partakes of the natures of both the Parties between whom he mediates, so, that he might transact <hi>personally</hi> with <hi>both,</hi> he was sent down from <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> and is returned again from <hi>us</hi> to <hi>Heaven.</hi> For since he was appointed to Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate between God and Men, it was highly expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that he should <hi>personally</hi> address to <hi>both</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that so he might more <hi>closely</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> solicite a <hi>mutual</hi> reconciliation between them, and that being personally <hi>known</hi> to both, they might both repose their <hi>trust</hi> in him with greater
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58668:33"/>
                  <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>assurance.</hi> He was well known to the <hi>Father,</hi> in whose bosom he dwelt from all Eternity, to be a Person every way <hi>fitted</hi> to be intrusted with his <hi>authority</hi> and the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Government,</hi> as communicating with him in the same <hi>divine Essence,</hi> and consequently <hi>essential Dominion</hi>; by reason of which no person in the World could be so much <hi>concerned</hi> for his Father's <hi>Authority</hi> as <hi>he</hi> was, and consequently no Person could be so proper to be <hi>intrusted</hi> with it; and therefore when upon the first <hi>breach</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men there arose an occasion for a <hi>Mediator,</hi> God could not but be infinitely <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> that there was none so <hi>fit</hi> to act on <hi>his</hi> part, or Mediate for <hi>him,</hi> as his own Son. But then since he was neither <hi>known</hi> to us by <hi>person,</hi> nor <hi>allied</hi> to us by <hi>nature,</hi> as he was to his <hi>Father, we</hi> could have no such reason as the <hi>Father</hi> had to place our <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> in him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though when he <hi>first</hi> undertook his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship between God and us he <hi>was</hi> not <hi>related</hi> to us by nature as he was to the Father, yet it was upon an <hi>agreement</hi> between the Father and him that he <hi>should</hi> hereafter assume this <hi>relation</hi> to us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Son of <hi>Man</hi> as well as the Son of <hi>God,</hi> that he was admitted to this Office. So that though from our <hi>Fall</hi> to his <hi>Incarnation</hi> he was not <hi>Man</hi> but only <hi>God,</hi> yet all that time he Mediated as <hi>God-man</hi> between God and Men; he Mediated for God as <hi>actually</hi> subsisting in the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature, he Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated for men as he was <hi>infallibly</hi> to subsist in the <hi>humane</hi> nature also. He having therefore <hi>vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> and <hi>intentionally</hi> assumed our nature from his very first entrance on his Mediatorship, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58668:34"/>
become <hi>equally</hi> related to <hi>both</hi> Parties, but till he had <hi>actually</hi> assumed our natures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>manifested</hi> himself unto us, we could not have that <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> nor of his <hi>relation</hi> to us, that the Father had, nor consequently that reason to repose our <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> in him; and therefore that <hi>we</hi> might have the same reason to confide in him in his Mediation for <hi>us</hi> as <hi>God</hi> had in his Mediation for <hi>him,</hi> God so ordered it, not only that he should assume our nature, which, if he had so thought meet, he might have done without either being <hi>seen</hi> of us, or <hi>born</hi> among us, but also that he should <hi>so</hi> assume it as to be visibly <hi>born</hi> of humane kind, and <hi>manifested</hi> in it in the open <hi>view</hi> and <hi>sight</hi> of the World. For in the <hi>fulness of that time,</hi> which was long before prefixed in the Eternal Council of God, the Holy Ghost by an <hi>immediate, invisible,</hi> and <hi>miraculous</hi> operation on the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>Immaculate</hi> Womb of a Virgin called <hi>Mary</hi> of the Lineage of <hi>David,</hi> inabled her without any Congress of Man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Child of <hi>humane kind,</hi> consisting of a <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> Soul in a <hi>mortal</hi> body, which the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> or natural <hi>Son of God,</hi> who was before all Worlds, immediately <hi>assumed</hi> into a <hi>personal Vnion</hi> with himself, whereby he became <hi>God-man</hi> who before was only <hi>God</hi>; and this without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commixing his <hi>two</hi> natures into <hi>one,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting <hi>either</hi> of them into the <hi>other,</hi> but under their Personal Union preserving them still <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> and <hi>separate</hi>; which <hi>God-man</hi> the blessed Virgin that <hi>conceived</hi> him actually <hi>brought forth</hi> after the natural time of Women, and <hi>Nursed</hi> and <hi>Educated</hi> till he arrived to the <hi>Age of man,</hi>

at which time he began personally to <hi>treat</hi> with men in his <hi>Father</hi>'s behalf, and, in order to the <hi>reducing</hi> them to their bounden <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> to the Throne of Heaven, <hi>revealed</hi> his Mind and Will to them with his own mouth, and <hi>pressed</hi> and <hi>inforced</hi> it upon them with the most <hi>powerful</hi> Motives that ever were urged to mankind, and by his own <hi>miraculous</hi> Works and most <hi>holy</hi> Example abundantly <hi>demonstrated</hi> to them that what he revealed to be the Will of his Father was <hi>true</hi> and <hi>practicable.</hi> Thus far in his <hi>own person</hi> he Mediated for his <hi>Father</hi> with <hi>Men,</hi> as I shall shew more fully hereafter.</p>
               <p>The consideration of which ought in all reason and conscience to render his Mediation more <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi> with us. For when God the <hi>Father</hi> hath condescended so far as to send down his only Son from Heaven on an Embassie to us to propose to <hi>us</hi> terms of reconciliation who had so highly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed</hi> and <hi>affronted</hi> him; when God the <hi>Son</hi> hath condescended so far as to cloath himself in <hi>our</hi> nature, that therein he might <hi>indear</hi> himself to us, and thereby <hi>oblige</hi> us to listen more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to his <hi>gracious</hi> proposals, what a <hi>stupendous</hi> height of obstinacy will it be in us to <hi>stop</hi> our <hi>Ears</hi> against him, and <hi>reject</hi> those terms of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> he proposes to us, by persisting in a <hi>wilful</hi> rebellion? Had God sent but one of the <hi>lowest</hi> Angels in Heaven to us to promise <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>eternal life</hi> to us upon condition we would but sincerely <hi>submit</hi> to his Will, one would have thought a proposal so infinitely <hi>reasonable</hi> in it self, and <hi>advantagious</hi> to us, should have been imbraced by us with <hi>transports</hi> and <hi>raptures</hi>; but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58668:35"/>
to reject it <hi>now</hi> when he hath sent it to us by his own <hi>Eternal Son,</hi> whom all his Angels <hi>adore,</hi> and by his Son <hi>incarnate</hi> in our own natures, is such a degree of <hi>obstinacy</hi> and <hi>ingratitude</hi> together, as no <hi>Devil</hi> was ever guilty of. Suppose that you beheld this most <hi>glorious</hi> Person coming down to you from the right hand of God to tender you a <hi>Pardon</hi> and a <hi>Crown</hi> upon condition you would <hi>submit</hi> to his Father's Will, and denounce <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting vengeance</hi> against you if you persist in your <hi>rebellion,</hi> would you dare by refusing to submit, to <hi>reject</hi> that Pardon and that Crown, and <hi>defie</hi> that vengeance to his face? One would think it were <hi>impossible</hi>; but yet <hi>in effect</hi> you do the same thing, who believe that <hi>that</hi> Jesus who preached this Gospel to the World 1600. years ago was the Son of God in Humane Nature, and yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately refuse to submit to its proposals. Hence from this very Topick, that <hi>God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his own Son,</hi> Heb. 1.2. the Apostle himself makes this inference, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip,</hi> Heb. 2.1.</p>
               <p>And now having finished his <hi>Personal</hi> Treaty or Mediation <hi>with</hi> us <hi>for</hi> God, he lays the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his <hi>everlasting</hi> Intercession <hi>for</hi> us <hi>with</hi> God before our own <hi>Eyes, viz.</hi> in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of himself for the sins of the World. He might, if he had pleased, have suffered death for us in the <hi>invisible</hi> state, and received those tortures from the malice of <hi>Devils</hi> which were inflicted on him by the malice of <hi>devilish men,</hi> but that would not have given so great a <hi>satisfaction</hi> to our <hi>Faith.</hi> For
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58668:35"/>
for the <hi>Son of God</hi> to lay down his life for <hi>Sinners,</hi> is such a <hi>stupendous</hi> instance of <hi>love,</hi> as would have <hi>exceeded</hi> the <hi>belief</hi> of Mankind, had it not been <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>visibly</hi> transacted; and therefore he rather chose to resign up himself into the hands of the <hi>Iews</hi> his <hi>cruel</hi> Persecutors, and by <hi>them</hi> to offer up his Life upon the Cross in the <hi>Publick view</hi> of the World. And now having given this <hi>sensible</hi> evidence to our <hi>Faith</hi> that he <hi>died</hi> for us, to satisfie us farther that his death was <hi>accepted</hi> by his Father as a <hi>full</hi> atonement for our sins, he <hi>rose again</hi> from the dead the third day after his Crucifixion, which was a plain evidence that his Father was fully <hi>satisfied</hi> with what he had <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> for us, because he <hi>exacted</hi> no more, but by his <hi>Resurrection</hi> actually <hi>discharged</hi> him from any <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> suffering <hi>for ever.</hi> So that the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ is not only an <hi>evidence</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of his <hi>Religion,</hi> under which notion I shall discourse of it hereafter, but also of the <hi>acceptation</hi> of his <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> For so the Apostle intimates in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who then shall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again, i. e.</hi> Who is there now that can presume to denounce eternal condemnation against any good Christian, since Christ himself hath <hi>laid down his life</hi> for him, <hi>yea rather</hi> since he is <hi>risen again from the dead,</hi> and hath thereby given sufficient evidence that God hath <hi>accepted</hi> his <hi>death</hi> as our <hi>ransom</hi> from eternal condemnation? And now having satisfied our Faith in these <hi>two</hi> great points, that he <hi>died</hi> for our sins, and that God hath <hi>accepted</hi> his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58668:36"/>
death in lieu of that eternal punishment that was due for them, all the <hi>farther</hi> satisfaction we can <hi>ask</hi> or <hi>need</hi> is, that as he <hi>came down</hi> from the Father to Mediate personally <hi>with</hi> us <hi>for</hi> him, so he should <hi>return</hi> back again to the Father to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate personally <hi>for</hi> us <hi>with</hi> him, to <hi>exhibite</hi> and <hi>plead</hi> his <hi>meritorious</hi> Sacrifice in our behalf, and in <hi>vertue</hi> thereof to <hi>solicite</hi> our <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with God. And therefore to satisfie us in <hi>this</hi> also, after he had abode some time upon Earth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and satisfied his Disciples by <hi>frequent</hi> converses with them that he was <hi>really</hi> risen, and given them all <hi>necessary</hi> Orders for their <hi>future</hi> conduct in the propagation of his Gospel, he carried them out to <hi>Bethany,</hi> where after he had lift up his hands and blessed them, he ascended before their eyes into Heaven, upon which it is said, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.52. <hi>That they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him, and returned to Ierusalem with great Ioy</hi>; surely not because their dear Lord was gone from them, never in this World to be seen by them more, <hi>that</hi> was cause of <hi>sorrow</hi> rather than <hi>joy</hi> to them; but because he was gone to the right hand of the Father, there to <hi>intercede</hi> in Person for them, and for ever to <hi>exhibite</hi> that <hi>wounded</hi> and <hi>bleeding</hi> body of his, by which he had made <hi>expiation</hi> for the sins of the World, and <hi>purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> the <hi>promise</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of <hi>eternal life</hi>; upon <hi>this</hi> account indeed they had great cause to <hi>rejoyce,</hi> because now they knew they had a <hi>sure</hi> Friend in Heaven where their main <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> lay, even that very Friend who not long before had freely exposed himself to a most <hi>shameful</hi> and <hi>tormenting</hi> death to rescue them from <hi>death
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58668:36"/>
eternal,</hi> and who after such an instance of <hi>love</hi> they could not but conclude would employ his utmost interest with the Father in their behalf, and, in a word, who being the <hi>only begotten</hi> of the Father, whose precious Bloud he had graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously <hi>accepted</hi> as a <hi>ransom</hi> for the sins of the World, could not but have an <hi>interest</hi> with him <hi>infinitely</hi> sufficient to obtain for them all the <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>favours</hi> that were fit either for them to ask, or for his Father to bestow. So that now if we heartily comply with him as Mediating for his <hi>Father</hi> with <hi>us,</hi> we have all the encouragement in the world to <hi>depend</hi> on him as Mediating for <hi>us</hi> with his <hi>Father,</hi> since he doth not Mediate with him by a <hi>second hand,</hi> or at <hi>a distance,</hi> but in his <hi>own Person,</hi> in <hi>that</hi> very Person which is not only infinitely <hi>dear</hi> to the Father as being his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, but hath also infinitely merited of him by offering him his own life at his command as a Sacrifice for the sins of the World. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly upon this consideration the Apostle founds the hope of Christians, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>My little Children these things write I unto you that ye sin not, but if any man sin,</hi> let him not presently give up himself as hopeless and irrecoverable, for <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the Righteous, and he is the Propitiation for our sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. And lastly, Another thing which the Scripture proposes to our belief concerning this Mediator is that upon his return from us to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there to Mediate Personally for <hi>Men</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> he <hi>substituted</hi> the <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>Omnipresent Spirit</hi> Personally to <hi>promote</hi> and <hi>effectuate</hi> his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58668:37"/>
for <hi>God</hi> with <hi>Men.</hi> When he went up to Heaven, there to Mediate for <hi>us</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> he did not thereby <hi>abandon</hi> his Mediation for <hi>God</hi> with <hi>us,</hi> but immediately <hi>substituted</hi> a certain <hi>mighty, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Being to act for him, whom he calls the <hi>Advocate,</hi> or, as we render it, the <hi>Comforter</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and who was to Mediate with Men in his behalf even as he Mediated with them in the behalf of his <hi>Father,</hi> and to Advocate for his Authority as he Advocated for his <hi>Father</hi>'s. For so he tells his <hi>Ministers,</hi> whom he left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him to assert and propagate his Authority in the World, <hi>I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter</hi> or Advocate, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>plead</hi> for, and <hi>inforce</hi> your Ministry in <hi>my</hi> behalf, whose Ministers you are, <hi>that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will not leave you comfortless,</hi> or without an Advocate. <hi>I will come to you,</hi> that is, by this Spirit of Truth who is to be <hi>my</hi> Vicegerent even as I am my <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16, 17, 18. But for the fuller explication of this great and necessary Article I shall, first, shew what this <hi>divine Spirit</hi> is which Christ hath substituted to Mediate for God with us in his absence. Secondly, I shall explain his <hi>subordination,</hi> and <hi>substitution</hi> to Christ in <hi>this</hi> part of his Mediation. Thirdly, I shall shew what it is that he <hi>hath</hi> done, and still <hi>continues</hi> to do in order to the <hi>effecting</hi> this Mediation.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>What</hi> this <hi>divine Spirit</hi> is which Christ hath substituted to Mediate for God with us in his absence. I answer, it is the <hi>third Person</hi> in the <hi>Tri-une</hi> Godhead. For that besides the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> there is a third <hi>divine Person</hi> subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </ref>, and is most plainly and expresly asserted in holy Scripture; which third Person is known in Scripture by the name of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or the <hi>Spirit of the Lord.</hi> For that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> so often named in the New Testament is the same with that <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> so much celebrated in the Old, <hi>S. Peter</hi> expresly asserts, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>For the Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost</hi>; from which words it is evident that this <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> whom <hi>S. Peter</hi> here mentions is the very same with that <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of the Lord,</hi> by whom, as we are told in the Old Testament, the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were inspired, <hi>vid. Isa.</hi> 63.11. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.2. <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.7. and abundance of other places; and accordingly <hi>S. Peter</hi> applies that Prophecy of <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.28. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,</hi> to that miraculous descent of the Holy Ghost on the day of <hi>Pentecost, Acts</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>but this is that,</hi> saith he, <hi>which was spoken by the Prophet Ioel,</hi> &amp;c. which could not be <hi>true</hi> if <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> were not the same with <hi>Ioel</hi>'s <hi>spirit of the Lord.</hi> But it is most certain that the Holy Ghost whom <hi>S. Peter</hi> and the New Testament so often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was in the first place, a <hi>real Person,</hi> and not a meer <hi>Quality,</hi> as the <hi>Socinians</hi> vainly dream. For so we every where find personal properties and actions attributed to him. Thus he is said to speak, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.25. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. yea, and his <hi>speeches</hi> are frequently <hi>recorded</hi>; so Acts 10.20.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58668:38"/>
                  <hi>The Spirit said unto Peter, arise therefore, get thee down, and go with them, for I have sent thee</hi>; and Acts 13.2. <hi>The Holy Ghost said, separate me Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them</hi>; and how can we without horrible <hi>force</hi> to such plain, historical relations, which ought to be <hi>literal</hi> and not <hi>figurative,</hi> attribute these speeches to a meer <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Quality?</hi> And else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he is said to <hi>reprove the world, Iohn</hi> 16.8. and <hi>to search into and know the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10, 11. and <hi>to divide his Gifts severally to every man as he will,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. And not only so, but such things and actions are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him as can in no sence be attributed to the <hi>Father,</hi> which would be non-sence if he were only the <hi>vertue</hi> or <hi>power</hi> of the Father, and not a real <hi>Person, distinct</hi> from him. Thus the Holy Ghost is said to <hi>come,</hi> as <hi>sent</hi> from the Father, in the <hi>name</hi> of Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.26. and in <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. he is said to come, as <hi>sent</hi> from Christ, <hi>verse</hi> 7. And when he comes, Christ promises them, <hi>that he shall guide them into all truth, for he shall not speak of himself,</hi> saith he, <hi>but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak,</hi> ver. 13. Again, <hi>he shall glorifie me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you,</hi> verse 14. And to name no more, the Holy Ghost is said to <hi>make Intercession for the Saints according to the Will of God,</hi> Rom. 8.27. none of which things can in any tolerable sence be said of God the <hi>Father.</hi> Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only <hi>personal</hi> actions, but <hi>such</hi> personal actions also as cannot be attributed to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> are frequently attributed to the Holy Ghost; it hence necessarily follows, that he is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58668:38"/>
not meerly the <hi>vertue</hi> or <hi>power</hi> of the Father, but a <hi>distinct</hi> principle of action from him, that acts from and by himself, and consequently is a real <hi>person</hi> or <hi>subsistence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It being evident therefore, from what hath been said, that the Spirit of the Lord in the Old Testament is the same with the Holy Ghost in the New, and that the Holy Ghost in the New is a <hi>real person</hi> distinct from the Father, it hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the second place, that this Holy Ghost is a <hi>divine</hi> person, because in the Scripture-forms of <hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Benediction</hi> he is always ranked with <hi>divine</hi> persons, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father and the Son; thus Baptism is <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Matth. 28.19. And <hi>the Grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, and the love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all,</hi> is the usual form of Benediction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. Now that the <hi>Father</hi> is a <hi>divine</hi> person <hi>all</hi> acknowledge, and that the <hi>Son</hi> is so <hi>too</hi> hath been proved at large, and therefore since the Holy Ghost is ranked with the Father and the Son, both in our Baptismal Dedication and form of Benediction, that is a sufficient evidence that <hi>he</hi> is a <hi>divine</hi> person also. For what likelihood is there that in such <hi>solemn</hi> acts of Religion a meer <hi>Creature</hi> should be taken into <hi>copartnership</hi> with the <hi>divine Father</hi> and <hi>Son?</hi> But besides both in the Old and New Testament divine <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>perfections</hi> are attributed to him. Thus in <hi>Iob</hi> 33.4. Creation is ascribed to him, <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</hi> So also <hi>Iob</hi> 26.13. <hi>By his Spirit he hath garnished the Heavens.</hi> Since
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58668:39"/>
therefore to <hi>Create</hi> is a <hi>divine</hi> Act, and since eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Act flows from the <hi>Essence</hi> of the <hi>Agent,</hi> it follows that the Essence of this Spirit from which this divine Act of Creation flows, is <hi>divine.</hi> Again, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.7. <hi>Omnipresence</hi> is attributed to this divine Spirit; <hi>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?</hi> And if there be no place whither we can go from him, as the Question plainly implies there is not, then he must necessarily fill all places, and be Omnipresent. So again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Omniscience</hi> is attributed to him, <hi>for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God</hi>; and that by searching here is not meant <hi>Enquiry,</hi> but <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Comprehension,</hi> the next verse will inform us, <hi>For what man knows the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, save the Spirit of God.</hi> If then the Spirit's <hi>search</hi> be <hi>knowledge,</hi> and his Knowledge comprehends <hi>all things,</hi> what else is this but <hi>Omniscience</hi>? And as the <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> which the Scripture attributes to the Holy Ghost are <hi>divine,</hi> so are the <hi>Honours</hi> also. For so 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. our bodies are said to be <hi>the Temples of the Holy Ghost which is in us</hi>; now since there is nothing can make a <hi>Temple,</hi> which as <hi>such</hi> is the <hi>house of God,</hi> but only the Inhabitation of a <hi>divine Person,</hi> and since no person can have right to the <hi>honour</hi> of a Temple, which as <hi>such</hi> is made for <hi>divine Worship,</hi> but he to whom divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is <hi>due</hi>; it will hence necessarily follow, both that the Holy Ghost is a <hi>divine Person,</hi> and that he hath right to <hi>divine Worship</hi>; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. the Apostle makes the <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of God's Spirit in us to be that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58668:39"/>
us <hi>Temples of God,</hi> but how could his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's dwelling in us constitute us Temples of God, unless he himself were <hi>God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides all which he is in express words affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be God. So in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. <hi>Even unto this day when Moses is read, the Vail is upon their h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So also <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3, 4. <hi>Why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie unto the Holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God, i. e.</hi> in Lying to the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who is <hi>God</hi>; for if he were not <hi>God,</hi> as we are sure he is not <hi>man,</hi> it might as well have been said, thou hast not lied unto <hi>men</hi> only, no nor to the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> only, but unto <hi>God</hi>; and indeed it ought to be so expressed, supposing that by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> and <hi>God</hi> he did not mean the <hi>same</hi> thing, because the design of the words was to aggravate <hi>Ananias</hi> his crime, from the consideration of the greatness of the <hi>Person</hi> against whom it was committed, and therefore had the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> been any thing less than God, as we are sure the <hi>Apostles</hi> were, to whom the lye was immediately told, he ought

From all which Testimonies it is very apparent that this great <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> whom Christ hath substituted to carry on his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation for God with men in his absence, is no other than the <hi>third divine Person</hi> subsisting in the <hi>eternal Godhead.</hi> And indeed considering the <hi>mighty</hi> part he was to act, <hi>viz.</hi> to Mediate <hi>under</hi> Christ for God with men, the same reason which rendered it necessary for Christ to be God to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie him for this Office, <hi>vide</hi> Page 24. do render it altogether as necessary for the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to be so.

               <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To explain his <hi>subordination</hi> and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> to Christ, in this part of his Mediatorship for God with men. In order to which it is to be considered that this <hi>subordination</hi> of the sacred
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58668:40"/>
Persons in the holy Trinity proceeds not from any <hi>inequality</hi> of <hi>Essence,</hi> but from the inequality of their <hi>personal Properties.</hi> For as to their Essence they are all of them <hi>God,</hi> i. e. <hi>infinite</hi> in <hi>being</hi> and <hi>perfections</hi>; and being infinite, they must all be equal, there being no such thing as <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> in infinity; and then being equal in <hi>Essence,</hi> they must necessarily be equal in essential <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and consequently, as such, are no way subject or subordinate to one another. But as to their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Properties</hi> it cannot be denied but they are <hi>unequal</hi>; for the <hi>Father</hi> who <hi>begot,</hi> must in that respect be superiour to the Son, who was <hi>begotten,</hi> and the Holy Ghost who <hi>proceeded,</hi> must in that respect be <hi>inferiour</hi> to the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> from whom he proceeded; and upon this inequality their subordination is founded. For as there is a stated Number in the Trinity, by which the sacred Persons are determined to Three, so there is also a stated <hi>Order,</hi> by which they are ranked into a <hi>First,</hi> a <hi>Second,</hi> and a <hi>Third</hi>; which Order is not made by mutual consent or arbitrary constitution, but founded in the nature of those <hi>personal proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> by which they are distinguished from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For as the <hi>Father,</hi> being the <hi>Fountain</hi> of Godhead to the <hi>Son,</hi> must be <hi>first</hi> in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and as the <hi>Son</hi> together with the <hi>Father</hi> was the <hi>Fountain</hi> of Godhead to the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and therefore must be <hi>second</hi> to the Father, and in order of nature <hi>before</hi> the Holy Ghost; so the Holy Ghost <hi>proceeding</hi> from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> must of the Three be in order of nature the <hi>Third.</hi> For so the Scripture expresly asserts that he <hi>proceeded from the Father,</hi> John 15.26. and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58668:41"/>
also that he is <hi>the Spirit of the Son, Gal.</hi> 4.6. and <hi>the Spirit of Christ,</hi> Rom. 8.9. and the <hi>Spirit of Iesus Christ,</hi> Phil. 1.19. And being the Spirit both of the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> he must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to proceed from <hi>both.</hi> And where-ever the Holy Ghost is in the Old Testament called <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> it is in the Hebrew <hi>Ruach Elohim</hi> in the <hi>Plural,</hi> which seems to intimate that he proceeded not from <hi>one,</hi> but from <hi>two</hi> divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <hi>i. e.</hi> not from the Father <hi>alone,</hi> but from the Son <hi>also.</hi> So that though, as to their <hi>Godhead,</hi> they are all <hi>equal,</hi> yet in order of <hi>nature,</hi> and in respect of their <hi>personal properties,</hi> the third is <hi>inferiour,</hi> the second <hi>superiour,</hi> and the first <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi>; and being <hi>unequal</hi> in those personal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties by which they stand related to each other, it is very reasonable that according to these their personal <hi>inequalities</hi> they should be <hi>subordinate</hi> to one another, and consequently that the <hi>Father,</hi> who is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of the <hi>Divinity,</hi> should be <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> in the Divine Monarchy, and that the <hi>Son,</hi> who was <hi>begotten</hi> of him, should minister to him, and that the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who proceeded from the Father and the Son, should minister to <hi>both.</hi> And accordingly in all its <hi>external</hi> actions and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations <hi>this</hi> hath ever been the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> for the <hi>Father</hi> to act by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> by the Ministry of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> For so before the <hi>Fall</hi> of man, and consequently, before this <hi>Mediation</hi> of the Son commenced, it is evident that even in <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> the World the <hi>Father</hi> acted by the <hi>Son,</hi> and therefore is said to have made the World by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. and the <hi>Son</hi> acted by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> who
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58668:41"/>
is said to have moved upon the face of the <hi>Chaos, Gen.</hi> 1.2. for that by the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> there is meant the <hi>third Person</hi> in the Holy Trinity, we have reason to believe, because he is elsewhere said to have made man, and to have garnished the Heavens, as hath been already shewn. And in the same Method of <hi>subordination</hi> the Godhead hath always proceeded in its transactions with the world, and that more <hi>especially</hi> and <hi>remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably</hi> in this great affair of <hi>Mediating</hi> with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; wherein the <hi>Father</hi> hath always used the Ministry of the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> the Ministry of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; but in the matter of the <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it is evident that this <hi>subordination</hi> of these sacred persons was founded not only in these their <hi>personal inequalities,</hi> but also in a mutual <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> between them, in which the Son <hi>agreed</hi> with the Father that in case he would be so far <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> to Rebellious Mankind as to grant them a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>mercy,</hi> and therein among <hi>other</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings to promise them his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> he himself would assume <hi>our</hi> natures, and therein not only <hi>treat</hi> with us <hi>personally</hi> in order to the <hi>reducing</hi> us to our bounden Allegiance, but also die a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> for our sins; upon which agreement the Father long before the Son had <hi>actually</hi> performed his part of it, even from our first <hi>Apostasie,</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his <hi>Spirit</hi> to mankind, which Spirit was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>this</hi> end, that under the Son he should Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate with <hi>men</hi> in order to the reducing them to their due <hi>subjection</hi> to the Father. For all that heavenly <hi>influence</hi> which the Holy Ghost <hi>sheds</hi> forth upon the minds of men is wholly <hi>Mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> in God's behalf, and in order to the <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:58668:42"/>
men's minds unto him; and therefore in this his Mediation he must be supposed to act in <hi>subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> to the <hi>Son</hi> who is <hi>supreme</hi> Mediator; and accordingly as the Son <hi>hath</hi> been, and <hi>will</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Mediating with men by <hi>this</hi> blessed Spirit, even from his <hi>Ascension</hi> to the <hi>end of the World,</hi> so I make no doubt but he always Mediated with them by the <hi>same</hi> Spirit, even from the <hi>Fall</hi> of man to his <hi>Incarnation.</hi> For so in the time of the Old World, we read of the <hi>Spirit's striving with men, i. e.</hi> in order to the subduing their stubborn Wills to a due <hi>subjection</hi> to the Will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. in doing of which he even <hi>then</hi> Mediated for God with Men under the <hi>Great</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and so he hath <hi>continued</hi> to do through all <hi>successive</hi> Ages of the World. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more apparent from Scripture than that it is <hi>under</hi> Christ that the <hi>Spirit</hi> acts in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, upon which account he is called <hi>the Spirit of Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.11. even as by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Jews he is called the <hi>Spirit of the Messias,</hi> as was observed before; and this Spirit whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls the Spirit of Christ, was, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self there tells us, the Spirit which was in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophets; by which it is evident that long <hi>before</hi> Christ came, this Spirit was <hi>his,</hi> and that he acted by him. And even when he came down into the World to transact <hi>personally</hi> with men, he <hi>generally</hi> acted by this holy Spirit. For so at his <hi>Baptism</hi> we are told that <hi>the Holy Ghost descended on him in a bodily shape,</hi> Luke 3.22. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it is said, that he went away <hi>full of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Luk. 4.1. after which it is plain that it was <hi>by</hi> this Holy Ghost in him that he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58668:42"/>
                  <hi>Prophesied</hi> and wrought his <hi>Miracles</hi>; for so <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.1. the Prophet attributes the whole Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Christ to <hi>the Spirit of the Lord which was upon him</hi>; and in <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.28. our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self affirms, that <hi>he cast out Devils by the Spirit of God,</hi> and therefore he calls the Jews attributing his miraculous works to the Devil, <hi>blasphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Holy Ghost,</hi> Matt. 12.31. because it was by the power of the Holy Ghost that he wrought them. Now as the <hi>Father</hi>'s acting by the <hi>Son</hi> implies the Son's <hi>Subordination</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> so the <hi>Son</hi>'s acting by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> implies the Spirit's <hi>subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> which subordination of the Spirit in his <hi>Mediatorial Office</hi> is immediately founded in that <hi>Compact</hi> of the Son with the Father, upon which he undertook the Mediation. For the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>purchace</hi> of the Son's Bloud, and whatsoever he purchased he purchased of the Father by <hi>compact</hi> and <hi>agreement</hi> with him; so that <hi>now</hi> he hath a <hi>right</hi> to the Spirit's <hi>Ministry,</hi> not only by vertue of his <hi>proceeding</hi> from <hi>him,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Father,</hi> but also by the <hi>purchace</hi> of his own Bloud, whereby he obtained the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> of him from the Father. For so the Holy Ghost is said to be <hi>shed on us abundantly through Iesus Christ our Saviour, i. e.</hi> through the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> he makes in <hi>vertue</hi> of his <hi>meritorious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> Tit. 3.5, 6. For whatsoever comes to us from God <hi>through</hi> Christ, is part of what he hath <hi>purchased</hi> for us, and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5, 6. he makes <hi>Christ's dying for the ungodly</hi> the reason of the giving the Holy Ghost to us. The <hi>promise</hi> of the Holy Ghost therefore being part of the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace</hi> of Christ's bloud, he by his <hi>Advocation</hi> in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58668:43"/>
Heaven obtained the <hi>performance</hi> of it of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even as he doth the performance of all his <hi>other</hi> promises. For the Father being the <hi>supreme</hi> person in the Holy Trinity is the <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> Fountain of all our blessings, and every good thing we receive is derived from <hi>him</hi> to us <hi>through</hi> the Son, and <hi>by</hi> the Holy Ghost; and even the Holy Ghost <hi>himself</hi> is derived to us <hi>from</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>through</hi> the Advocation of the Son. For so he himself tells us, <hi>I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter,</hi> namely, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16. So that though Christ hath purchased the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> of the Father as he hath also all the <hi>other</hi> blessings of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> yet it is plain this Purchace <hi>vests</hi> him not with a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>bestow</hi> and <hi>send</hi> him <hi>without</hi> the Father, but only to <hi>obtain</hi> him <hi>of</hi> the Father upon his <hi>Prayer</hi> or <hi>Advocation</hi>; and so of all those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blessings. So that still the Father is the <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> Source from whence the Spirit and all those blessings are <hi>derived</hi> to us, and it is from <hi>his</hi> hands that the Son procures them by his powerful <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession</hi>; in short therefore, Christ by his death purchased a <hi>right</hi> of the Father to <hi>obtain</hi> of him by his <hi>Intercession</hi> Authority to send the Holy Ghost to Minister <hi>for</hi> and <hi>under</hi> him in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation for God with men; and accordingly he promises his Disciples that when he departed this World he would send the <hi>Comforter</hi> to them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.7. where he uses the very same phrase as he did when he Commissioned his Apostles to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster under him, <hi>As the Father hath sent me, so send I you,</hi> John 20.21. and accordingly his <hi>sending</hi> the Comforter must denote his <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioning</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58668:43"/>
him by the Authority he had <hi>received</hi> from the Father to minister under him in his Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Father. For so in <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.26. <hi>When the Comforter is come whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the Father, he shall testifie of me</hi>; where first, the Son is said to <hi>Commission</hi> or <hi>send</hi> him; Secondly, to Commission or send him <hi>from</hi> the Father, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Authority from him; And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to Commission or send him to <hi>testifie</hi> of him, and therein to <hi>minister</hi> to him; and so in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. when he was just ascending into Heaven he tells his Disciples, <hi>Behold I send the promise of my Father upon you, i. e.</hi> the promise of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; and accordingly, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33. St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us upon that miraculous descent of the Holy Ghost, that Christ <hi>being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Holy Ghost, (i. e.</hi> having by his <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> received <hi>authority</hi> of the Father to <hi>send</hi> the Holy Ghost, according to that promise which he had before <hi>purchased</hi> of him with his bloud) <hi>he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear, i. e.</hi> this <hi>Miraculous</hi> Gift of the Holy Ghost; in all which places it is evident that the Holy Ghost was <hi>substituted, commissioned,</hi> and <hi>sent</hi> by the Son, <hi>authorized</hi> thereunto by the Father, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister <hi>under</hi> him. For as the Son acts <hi>by</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Authority as he is <hi>his</hi> Minister, so all that authority which he <hi>communicates</hi> to others to act <hi>under</hi> him, he must derive Originally <hi>from</hi> the Father, and consequently that Authority by which he <hi>sent</hi> the Spirit to act as <hi>his</hi> Minister, he must have derived from the Father whose Minister <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:58668:44"/>
is; and hence the Father is said <hi>to send the Spirit in the name of the Son, i. e.</hi> to appoint the Spirit to act <hi>under</hi> the Son, and by <hi>his</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.26. as the Son is said <hi>to send the Spirit from the Father, i. e.</hi> by the authority which he had received <hi>of</hi> the Father; and this I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe is the reason why the Apostle in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. quotes the Psalmist with that variation, <hi>he ascended up on high,</hi> saith he, speaking of Christ, <hi>he led Captivity Captive, he gave gifts unto men,</hi> whereas the words of the Psalmist are, <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived gifts for men,</hi> Psal. 68.18. to denote that that gift of the Holy Ghost which Christ <hi>gave</hi> to his Church, was nothing but what he himself had first <hi>received</hi> from the Father; so that though it was from the <hi>Father</hi> that the Son had his <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> to send the Holy Ghost, yet it was from the <hi>Son</hi> that the Holy Ghost had his <hi>Mission immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</hi> And accordingly you may observe, that after Christ's departure from this World, the Holy Ghost acted <hi>immediately</hi> under Christ as the <hi>supreme Vicegerent</hi> of his Kingdom. For <hi>next</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> under Christ he Authorized the Bishops and Governours of the Church, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted them overseers of the flock of Christ,</hi> Acts 20.28. it was <hi>he</hi> that chose their <hi>Persons,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them their <hi>Work,</hi> Acts 13.2. and gave them their several <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Directions,</hi> Acts 15.28. Acts 16.6. in all which it is evident he acted <hi>under</hi> Christ, and still continues to act as his <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Substitute</hi> and <hi>Vicegerent</hi>; and accordingly he is stiled by <hi>Tertullian, the Vicarious vertue or power,</hi> as he was the supreme <hi>Vicar</hi> and <hi>Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of Christ in mediating for God with Men;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58668:44"/>
so that now the Holy Ghost is <hi>subordinated</hi> to the Son, not only by vertue of his <hi>procession</hi> from <hi>him</hi> together with the <hi>Father,</hi> but also by vertue of his being <hi>purchased</hi> and <hi>obtained</hi> by him <hi>of</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his meritorious <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Intercession.</hi> I proceed,</p>
               <p n="3">III. To shew <hi>what</hi> it is that this Holy Spirit <hi>hath</hi> done, and still <hi>continues</hi> doing in order to the <hi>effectuating</hi> this his Mediation. For there are some things which he <hi>hath</hi> done, and now <hi>ceases</hi> to do, and some things which he hath <hi>always</hi> done, and will <hi>still</hi> continue doing to the end of the World, of <hi>both</hi> which I shall give some brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in order to the fuller explication of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Holy Ghost under Jesus the great Mediator. First therefore there are some things which he <hi>hath</hi> done, and now <hi>ceases</hi> to do, and of this sort were those <hi>extraordinary</hi> operations he performed in order to the <hi>Planting</hi> and <hi>Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating</hi> Christ's Gospel in the World, <hi>upon</hi> and <hi>after</hi> that his Miraculous Descent, of which we read in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. For when Christ was departing from his Disciples into Heaven, he ordered them <hi>to stay at Ierusalem,</hi> and not to undertake that mighty work of <hi>Planting</hi> his Gospel through the World <hi>till they were endued with power from on high, Luke</hi> 24.49. which power from on high was no other than that <hi>miraculous</hi> assistance which upon his <hi>Descent</hi> the Holy Ghost did afterwards vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe them; upon which Order they return to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and there continue till the day of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost, fasting</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> together in an Upper Room, when all of a sudden the Holy Ghost <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended</hi> upon them in a <hi>visible</hi> body of bright

shining fire, and <hi>endowed</hi> them with all those <hi>Heavenly</hi> powers which were requisite to <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie</hi> them for the <hi>propagation</hi> of Christ's Gospel through the World. For as they were to be the first Planters of the Gospel, it was requisite, First, that they should be able to <hi>speak</hi> the several <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi> of those Nations to whom they were to preach; Secondly, that they should be <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>clearly</hi> instructed in the Doctrines which they were to preach; Thirdly, that they should be able to give the most <hi>convincing</hi> evidence of the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>divinity</hi> of their Doctrines; Fourthly, that they should be conducted by <hi>Infallible</hi> advice through all the <hi>emergent</hi> difficulties of their Ministry; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all which necessities the Holy Ghost abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly supplied <hi>them:</hi> For,</p>
               <p>First, He <hi>inspired</hi> them with the <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,</hi> without which they must have spent a <hi>great</hi> part of their lives, before they could have been capable of preaching the Gospel to the World, in <hi>learning</hi> the several Languages of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Nations</hi> they were to preach to; which must have very much <hi>retarded</hi> the <hi>progress</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. And therefore the Holy Ghost upon this his miraculous <hi>Descent,</hi> did in an <hi>instant</hi> infuse into them the <hi>Habit</hi> of speaking <hi>several</hi> Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; insomuch that all of a <hi>sudden,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Grammar</hi> or previous <hi>instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> they were heard to <hi>speak,</hi> to the great <hi>asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> of their Auditors, in the fifteen several <hi>Tongues</hi> of fifteen several <hi>Nations,</hi> Acts 2.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though they were immediately <hi>dispersed</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the World, and some of them into <hi>remote</hi> Countries, whose names perhaps they had never
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58668:45"/>
heard of, yet still where-ever they came they were <hi>inspired</hi> with the <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Country,</hi> which they spake as <hi>freely</hi> as their own <hi>Mother Tongue.</hi> And this was a vast advantage to them in their Ministry, because they were not only <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled</hi> by it to preach the Gospel to all Nations, but were enabled in <hi>such</hi> a manner, as gave a mighty <hi>confirmation</hi> to their <hi>Doctrine.</hi> For their very <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>speaking</hi> being a <hi>miraculous</hi> effect of divine power was an <hi>undeniable</hi> demonstration that what they spake was <hi>divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Holy Ghost <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>clearly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed them in the <hi>Doctrines</hi> which they were to preach; and this was no more than what was necessary. For what they preached, who were the first <hi>Planters</hi> of the Gospel, was to be the standard of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>falshood</hi> to all succeeding Generations, and therefore it was highly necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they should be fully and clearly <hi>instructed</hi> in the Doctrine of the Gospel, that so their <hi>Successors</hi> in all Ages might safely relie on their Authority. But whilst they were under the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal</hi> Discipline of our Saviour, who instructed them by <hi>Humane</hi> Methods, <hi>i. e.</hi> by <hi>proposing</hi> his Doctrine to their <hi>Ears,</hi> and through their Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> it is plain they made but very <hi>slow</hi> and <hi>slender</hi> improvements. For after all his pains with them, they continued very <hi>ignorant</hi> of some of the most <hi>material</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, and at best they had but <hi>gross</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of the nature of <hi>Christ's Kingdom,</hi> and of the <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>reasons</hi> of his Death, and were very <hi>diffident</hi> even of his <hi>Resurrection</hi>; and the reason was, that <hi>Christ</hi> taught them as a <hi>man</hi> doth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58668:46"/>
a <hi>man, i. e.</hi> by <hi>words,</hi> which are only the audible <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Representations</hi> of things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liable to <hi>misapprehension</hi> and <hi>oblivion,</hi> some of them they <hi>utterly</hi> fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>got, and some of them they <hi>grosly</hi> misunderstood. But when the <hi>Spirit</hi> came upon them, a wondrous <hi>Light</hi> broke all of a sudden into their <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> by which they <hi>discovered</hi> farther into the Gospel <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> in <hi>an instant</hi> than they had done under <hi>all</hi> our Saviour's teaching. For though the Spirit taught them no <hi>new</hi> Doctrines, but did only <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat</hi> and <hi>explain</hi> to them what our Saviour had taught them before, (<hi>for he shall receive of mine,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> of my Doctrine, <hi>and shall shew,</hi> or explain <hi>it unto you,</hi>) yet it is evident he taught them much more <hi>effectually</hi> than our <hi>Saviour.</hi> For he spoke not to their <hi>Ears,</hi> but to their <hi>Minds,</hi> and represented things more <hi>nakedly</hi> and <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> to their understandings; he <hi>conversed</hi> with their <hi>spirits,</hi> even as <hi>Spirits</hi> do with <hi>Spirits,</hi> without invol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing his <hi>sense</hi> in <hi>articulate</hi> sounds, or <hi>material</hi> representations, but <hi>objected</hi> it to them in its own <hi>naked</hi> light, and <hi>characterized</hi> it <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> on their understandings. And as he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately proposed the divine light to their minds, so he also <hi>illuminated</hi> their minds to <hi>discern</hi> and <hi>comprehend</hi> it; he <hi>raised</hi> and <hi>exalted</hi> their intellectual faculties, and, as a <hi>vital form</hi> to the light of their reason, did <hi>actuate,</hi> and thereby <hi>enable</hi> it to comprehend his Revelations. And hence, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6. we are told that the Disciples who upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s laying his hands on them received the Holy Ghost, spake with Tongues, and <hi>Prophesied,</hi> i. e. <hi>explained</hi> the deep Mysteries of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58668:46"/>
the Gospel; for so <hi>Prophesying</hi> in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth most commonly signifie; hence 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. the Apostle makes <hi>Prophecy</hi> to consist in <hi>understanding</hi> divine <hi>Mysteries</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and in ver. 9. <hi>We know in part,</hi> saith he, <hi>and we Prophesie in part</hi>; so that the effect of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Holy Ghost, you see, was <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that is, a clear <hi>understanding</hi> of, and <hi>ability</hi> to <hi>explain</hi> the Mysteries of Religion. A plain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence how effectually he taught them, in that they no sooner became his <hi>Scholars,</hi> but they were fit to be the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the World. For though it seems probable that <hi>he</hi> as well as <hi>our Saviour</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed them <hi>gradually</hi> in the knowledge of the Gospel, since it was some time <hi>after</hi> this first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent that the Mystery of the <hi>calling of the Gentiles</hi> was revealed to them, yet it is very apparent that he instructed them much <hi>faster</hi> than our Saviour had done, and much <hi>fuller,</hi> and that those <hi>impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of divine truth which he made upon their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings were much more <hi>vigorous</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> and therefore could not be so easily either forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or mistaken by them. And accordingly our Saviour himself tells them, that <hi>he had many things to say unto them, but they could not bear them,</hi> such was the narrowness of their capacity, and the way of <hi>his</hi> teaching: <hi>Howbeit,</hi> saith he, <hi>when the spirit of truth is come, he shall lead you into all truth,</hi> John 16.12, 13. <hi>and teach you all things,</hi> John 14.20. Thus the Holy Ghost fully instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them what Doctrines they were to preach to the World, and by his immediate inspirations enabled them to deliver down the truth to us, the <hi>whole</hi> truth, and nothing <hi>but</hi> the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:58668:47"/>Thirdly, The Holy Ghost enabled them to give the most <hi>convincing</hi> evidence of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> of their Doctrines; without which it was impossible they should ever have <hi>succeeded</hi> in their Ministry. But the only <hi>certain</hi> evidence they could give that their Doctrine was <hi>divine,</hi> was the testimony of <hi>Miracles.</hi> For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which <hi>pretends</hi> to be divine can any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>evidence</hi> it self to <hi>be so,</hi> but by something that is <hi>apparently</hi> divine; and there being nothing apparently divine but what is <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>evidently</hi> a <hi>miraculous</hi> effect of <hi>divine power,</hi> it follows that Miracles <hi>only</hi> can attest the <hi>Divinity</hi> of any <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</hi> Wherefore to enable the first Planters of the Gospel to convince the World that their <hi>Doctrine</hi> was <hi>divine,</hi> it was highly requisite that they should be endowed with this <hi>divine power</hi> of working <hi>Miracles</hi>; and accordingly so they were upon this miraculous descent of the Holy Ghost upon them. For so, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.43. upon this coming of the Holy Ghost on them we are told that <hi>many wonders and signs were done by the Apostles</hi>; so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.30, 31. that upon their praying that God would <hi>stretch forth his hand to heal, and that signs and wonders might be done by the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>; God in answer to their Prayer <hi>filled them with the Holy Ghost,</hi> that is, enabled them by <hi>his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> to effect these <hi>signs,</hi> and <hi>wonders</hi> they had prayed for. It is true indeed, they had in <hi>some measure</hi> this gift of the Holy Ghost <hi>before</hi> this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Descent, even while our Saviour was among them, but that was very <hi>sparingly,</hi> and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon some particular <hi>occasions,</hi> and for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting some particular <hi>Miracles</hi>; but our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58668:47"/>
promised them that upon his going to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to send the Comforter to them, <hi>They who believed on him should not only do the Works which he did, but greater works than those,</hi> John 14.12. and accordingly when after his <hi>Ascension</hi> the Holy Ghost came upon them, he <hi>continued</hi> with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon <hi>all</hi> occasions impowered them to do <hi>all</hi> kinds of Miracles for the confirmation of their Doctrine; so that whereas before the greatest part of these <hi>miraculous</hi> signs of the <hi>divinity</hi> of the <hi>Christian Doctrine</hi> were performed by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his <hi>own Person,</hi> and by that means confined to the place of his <hi>Personal</hi> habitation, which was too <hi>narrow</hi> a Theatre for many Spectators to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, the Holy Ghost by working Miracles in <hi>his</hi> name of <hi>all</hi> sorts, and upon <hi>all</hi> occasions <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> his Ministers, who were presently to be <hi>dispersed</hi> over the face of the whole Earth, did much more <hi>amply</hi> display his divine power, and with greater <hi>speed</hi> spread the renown of it through the World, and by constantly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering so <hi>many</hi> persons in so <hi>many</hi> parts of the World to perform so <hi>many</hi> miraculous things in <hi>Christ</hi>'s name, did as it were carry him in open <hi>Triumph</hi> through the World, and at once display his <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> over the face of the whole Earth. For what Christ did in his <hi>own Person</hi> while he was on Earth, <hi>that</hi> and <hi>much more</hi> the Holy Ghost did in the persons of all his <hi>Ministers</hi>; and the Holy Ghost did that at the <hi>same time</hi> in a <hi>thousand</hi> parts of the World which Christ did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>one</hi>; and by these <hi>miraculous</hi> effects, which are therefore called <hi>the evidence and demonstration of the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. the Holy Ghost asserted
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58668:48"/>
to the World the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>divinity</hi> of those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Jesus taught. For this gift of Miracles <hi>expired</hi> not with those <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Ministers, but was continued down to their <hi>Successors</hi> for several Generations together, until the Christian Doctrine was <hi>propagated</hi> through the World; and then, when it had done its <hi>work,</hi> and accomplished its <hi>end,</hi> it was <hi>withdrawn,</hi> as being no longer <hi>necessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly and lastly, The Holy Ghost conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by his own <hi>infallible</hi> advice through all the <hi>emergent</hi> difficulties of their <hi>Ministry.</hi> For the work wherein they were ingaged was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>difficulties</hi> that were utterly <hi>insuperable</hi> to Humane <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> For first their work being such as required an <hi>invincible</hi> courage and <hi>firm</hi> integrity of mind, a <hi>watchful</hi> prudence and <hi>spotless</hi> purity of manners, it was highly need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, especially <hi>at first</hi> (a good <hi>beginning</hi> being of vast <hi>importance</hi> to all great <hi>undertakings</hi>) that they should be <hi>infallibly</hi> directed what <hi>persons</hi> were fit to be <hi>ordained</hi> to it, and <hi>which</hi> of those were mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> for the several <hi>Countries</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> of the World; and then through the whole course of their Ministry they were fain to <hi>contend</hi> with all the united <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> of the World, and were very often sent to preach among <hi>strange</hi> Nations, whose <hi>Tempers</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> they understood not, and still where-ever they came they had <hi>Spies</hi> upon them to <hi>watch</hi> their Designs, and <hi>observe</hi> their actions, and ever and anon they were <hi>accused</hi> and <hi>impleaded</hi> by <hi>subtil</hi> and <hi>insinuating</hi> Orators before the <hi>Tribunals</hi> of their Enemies, and there forced to answer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58668:48"/>
Besides that they being to <hi>convert</hi> both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> between whom there was an <hi>inveterate</hi> aversion, and to <hi>unite</hi> them together into <hi>one</hi> communion, it could not be otherwise expected but that great <hi>dissentions</hi> should arise among their <hi>own</hi> Converts, as accordingly it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; which if not managed with infinite <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> must needs give a great <hi>disturbance</hi> to them, and <hi>interrupt</hi> the course, and <hi>hinder</hi> the success of their Ministry. And in such <hi>difficult</hi> circumstances it was almost impossible for them not to <hi>miscarry</hi> without being conducted by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>circumspection</hi>; under all which <hi>exigencies</hi> the Holy Ghost served the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church in the same capacity as the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> did the ancient <hi>Iews, i. e.</hi> as an <hi>Oracle</hi> to <hi>advise</hi> them in all cases of <hi>difficulty,</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> them in the management of all their <hi>great</hi> and <hi>weighty</hi> affairs. Thus in that difficult case, which of the Apostles should be sent forth to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> the Holy Ghost either by a <hi>Bath Col, i. e.</hi> Voice from Heaven, or an immediate <hi>inspiration,</hi> thus directs them, <hi>Separate me Paul and Barnabas for the work whereunto I have called them,</hi> Acts 13.2. and when they went forth among the Gentiles, the Holy Ghost advises them where they <hi>should</hi> preach, and where <hi>not, Acts</hi> 16.6. and so also in the choice of their Bishops they had always the <hi>Direction</hi> of the Holy Ghost; so in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. it is said that it was the <hi>Holy Ghost that set them over the Flock,</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Episcopal Office</hi> wherewith he was invested, was given him <hi>by Prophecy, i. e.</hi> by the <hi>immediate</hi> direction of the Holy Ghost; and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58668:49"/>
                  <hi>S. Clemens,</hi> who was a Disciple of the Apostles, tells us, that in those times they ordained Bishops, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>discerning</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> who should be ordained; and again, that they did it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, having a perfect <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> who they should chuse. And thus also for composing the differences which arose between their <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts, they had the <hi>immediate</hi> advice of the Holy Ghost, who direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to that <hi>wise</hi> expedient, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. by which the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> was secured for the <hi>present,</hi> and <hi>afterwards</hi> maintained in despite of all the attempts of <hi>seditious</hi> Incendiaries to <hi>break</hi> and <hi>divide</hi> it. And thus having <hi>recourse</hi> upon all occasions to this <hi>infallible</hi> Guide, they were never at <hi>a loss</hi> either <hi>what</hi> to say, or <hi>how</hi> to behave themselves; the Holy Ghost <hi>making good</hi> to them what our Saviour had <hi>promised</hi> them, <hi>When they bring you before Magistrates, take no thought what ye shall answer, for the Holy Ghost shall teach you at the same hour what ye ought to say,</hi> Luke 12.11, 12.</p>
               <p>These are the extraordinary things which the Holy Ghost acted <hi>for</hi> and <hi>under</hi> Christ, in order to the <hi>planting</hi> and <hi>propagating</hi> his Gospel through the World, and which he <hi>continued</hi> to act so long as it was <hi>necessary</hi> for that end. For as for the first, the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Tongues,</hi> it seems to have been continued no longer than till the Gospel had been preached <hi>to,</hi> and some Converts made <hi>in</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations, the <hi>First-fruits</hi> of whom were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ordained to the work of the Ministry; and when once the several Nations had <hi>Natives</hi> of their own to preach the Gospel to them in their
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58668:49"/>
                  <hi>own</hi> Languages, there was no farther necessity of this miraculous Gift of Tongues. And then as for the second, the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Revelation,</hi> it seems to have been continued no longer than till the whole <hi>New Testament</hi> was revealed, and the several parts of it were collected into <hi>one Volume,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed to the several Churches, after which there was no farther necessity of any <hi>new</hi> revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But as for the third, the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi> it seems to have been continued much longer than either of the <hi>former,</hi> as indeed there was long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er occasion for it, especially for that of ejecting <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> who for many Ages had been the Gods of the World, and detecting their <hi>frauds</hi> and <hi>impostures,</hi> that so by beholding the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Triumphs of Christ's power over them, the Heathen might be at length convinced of the <hi>false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> Religion, and of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s; and accordingly <hi>this</hi> gift, as I shall shew hereafter, was continued in the Church for above two hundred years together, till it had wrought its designed effect, <hi>i. e.</hi> had sufficiently detected the <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> of those Idol Gods, to the conviction of all that were convincible, and then it was withdrawn as being no farther necessary. And then as for the last, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Direction,</hi> it seems to have been continued no longer than till the Government of the Church was every where <hi>established,</hi> and its Affairs redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a stated <hi>course</hi> and <hi>method,</hi> by which suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient provision being made against those emergent difficulties with which the state of Christianity was perplexed, <hi>this</hi> Gift also ceased, together with the <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> of it. Thus by these
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58668:50"/>
extraordinary <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> the Holy Ghost continued to <hi>sollicite</hi> the cause of Christ and his Religion in the World, till by their invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible evidence he had baffled the <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> of a <hi>deluded</hi> World, and <hi>captivated</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into the <hi>belief</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> of the Gospel; and this being effected he discontinued those <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaries,</hi> and now proceeds to solicite the same cause in a more <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>standing</hi> way and method, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>co-operating</hi> with mens minds and wills in a more <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by joyning in with their <hi>Reason,</hi> and thereby influencing their <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi>; which brings me to the</p>
               <p n="2">2. Second sort of the Holy Ghost's operations, <hi>viz.</hi> that which he <hi>ordinarily</hi> doth, and always <hi>hath</hi> done, and <hi>will</hi> always continue to do. For upon the cessation of these his <hi>miraculous</hi> operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Holy Ghost did not wholly <hi>withdraw</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from mankind, but he still <hi>continues</hi> Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with us under Christ in order to the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling our <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> to God, and subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that inveterate <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Enmity</hi> against him, which our <hi>degenerate</hi> nature hath contracted. For it is by this blessed Spirit that Christ hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to <hi>be with us to the end of the World,</hi> Matth. 28.20. and Christ himself hath assured us that upon his Ascension into Heaven he <hi>would pray his Father, and he should give us another Comforter,</hi> meaning this Holy Ghost, <hi>that he might abide with us for ever,</hi> John 14.16. and accordingly the Holy Ghost is <hi>vitally united</hi> to the Church of Christ, even as Souls are united to their bodies. For as <hi>there is one body, i. e.</hi> Church, so <hi>there
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58668:50"/>
is one Spirit, i. e.</hi> one Holy Ghost which <hi>animates</hi> that body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4. and hence the Unity of the Church is in the foregoing verse called the <hi>Vnity of the Spirit,</hi> because as the soul by <hi>diffusing</hi> it self through all the parts of the body <hi>unites</hi> them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and keeps them from <hi>flying abroad</hi> and <hi>dispersing</hi> into atomes, so the Holy Spirit by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing himself throughout this <hi>mystical</hi> body <hi>joyns</hi> and <hi>unites</hi> all its parts together, and makes it one <hi>separate</hi> and <hi>individual</hi> Corporation. So that when by Baptism we are once incorporated into this body we are intitled <hi>to,</hi> and do at least <hi>de jure</hi> participate <hi>of</hi> the vital influence of the Holy Ghost, who is the <hi>Soul</hi> of it; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, as Baptism joyns us to that <hi>body</hi> of which this divine Spirit is the <hi>Soul,</hi> so it also conveys that divine Spirit to us. So that as in <hi>natural</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies those Ligaments which <hi>unite</hi> and <hi>tie</hi> the parts to one another, do also convey <hi>life</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> to them all; so also in this <hi>mystical</hi> body those <hi>federal</hi> rights of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, which are as it were its <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,</hi> that <hi>joyn</hi> and <hi>confederate</hi> its members to one another, are also the conveyances of that <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> life from the Holy Ghost which <hi>moves</hi> and <hi>actuates</hi> them all. And hence <hi>the washing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> and <hi>the renewing of the Holy Ghost,</hi> the <hi>being born of water and of the Holy Ghost</hi> are put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as concurrent things, and in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is affirmed to be necessary to our receiving the Holy Ghost; and if by Baptism we receive the Holy Ghost, that is, a <hi>right</hi> and <hi>title</hi> to his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Influence,</hi> then must the Holy Ghost be still supposed <hi>vitally united</hi> to the Church,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58668:51"/>
whereof we are made members by our Baptism, and like an <hi>Omnipresent Soul,</hi> to be <hi>diffused</hi> all through it, and to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>actuate</hi> every part of it by his heavenly <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Influence.</hi>

               <p>It is true, he doth not move and actuate us by meer <hi>force</hi> and irresistible <hi>power,</hi> so as to <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate</hi> us, or to <hi>determine</hi> our natural liberty one way or t'other; nor doth he ordinarily work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men in such a <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>miraculous</hi> way as he did in the first Ministration of the Gospel, when he frequently transformed men in an instant from <hi>Beasts</hi> and <hi>Devils</hi> into <hi>Saints,</hi> and as it were at one act turned the whole <hi>Tide</hi> of their natures into a quite contrary <hi>Current.</hi> For so <hi>Origen</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Celsus</hi> very often triumphs in these <hi>sudden</hi> and <hi>miraculous</hi> Conversions wrought by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion; so <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 21. should any man, saith he, release men's Souls from all sorts of wickedness, from Lust, and Unrighteousness, and Contempt of God, and this but in a hundred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, surely no man would imagine that he could ever have inspired so many men with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons strong enough to conquer so many Vices without a <hi>divine</hi> assistance; but if you enquire into the lives of those that have imbraced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, you will find that whereas before they lived in all impurities and lusts, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>But since Christianity hath been <hi>spread</hi> through the World, and <hi>prevailed</hi> so far as to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Nations, the divine Spirit doth not <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily</hi> work upon men in such a <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous</hi> way, nor produce in them such <hi>sudden</hi> Changes and <hi>instantaneous</hi> Conversions, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds more <hi>gradually,</hi> and more suitably to the Methods of Humane Nature, by joyning in with our <hi>understandings,</hi> and leading us on by <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>persuasion</hi> from <hi>Acts</hi> to <hi>Dispositions,</hi> and from <hi>Dispositions</hi> to <hi>Habits</hi> of Piety. So that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Grace</hi> he <hi>now</hi> affords us, it ordinarily works on us in the same <hi>way,</hi> and after the same <hi>manner</hi> as if all were performed by the strength of our <hi>own</hi> reason; so that in the <hi>Renovation</hi> of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we cannot certainly distinguish what is done by the <hi>Spirit</hi> from what is done by our <hi>natural Reason</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> co-operating with <hi>him</hi>; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this we do most certainly know, that in this blessed work the Spirit is the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> Agent; that <hi>without him we can do nothing</hi>; and that <hi>he is the Author and Finisher of our faith,</hi> who <hi>worketh in us to will and to do according to his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58668:52"/>
own pleasure</hi>; but yet that he doth not work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us as a <hi>Mechanick</hi> upon <hi>dead</hi> materials, but as upon <hi>living</hi> and <hi>free</hi> Agents, that <hi>can</hi> and <hi>must</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with him; that he acts not on us by any <hi>necessary</hi> causality, but in such a way as is fairly consistent with the <hi>natural liberty</hi> of our Wills; and doth not renew us whether we <hi>will</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> but takes our free <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>endeavour</hi> along with him; and that having done all on <hi>his</hi> part, that is necessary to perswade us, he expects that we should <hi>consider</hi> what he saith, and upon that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to his <hi>gracious</hi> Motions, and express this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in a constant course of <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>vertuous</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour; and that unless we do <hi>thus</hi> concur with him, we shall for ever <hi>remain</hi> and <hi>perish</hi> in our sin, notwithstanding all that grace which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us. But as for the particular <hi>manner</hi> of the Holy Ghost's operation on our mind, it is not to be expected that we who know so little of the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>intercourse</hi> of Spirits should be able to render a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> account of it; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus much may be said, that our Soul being a <hi>thinking</hi> Spirit, whose very Essence consists in a power or principle of <hi>cogitation,</hi> seems natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incapable of any other passion from any <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Agent, but only the impression of <hi>Thoughts.</hi> For how can a <hi>Spirit,</hi> whose very Essence is <hi>thinking,</hi> be any otherwise affected by any thing <hi>without</hi> it, but only by being made to <hi>think,</hi> or by having such <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>considerations</hi> impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on it? And by the same reason that bodies which are <hi>material</hi> substances are impressible on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>matter,</hi> Souls which are <hi>thinking</hi> substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces must be impressible only by <hi>Thought.</hi> And
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58668:53"/>
hence we find by experience that there is no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject we converse with can any otherwise affect our <hi>Mind,</hi> than by suggesting such <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>cogitations</hi> to it, and that all the <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>torment</hi> of our minds consists in <hi>joyful</hi> and <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting</hi> thoughts; which are plain Arguments that our mind is a sort of Being which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but thought can <hi>strike</hi> or <hi>touch,</hi> and which hath no <hi>sense</hi> or <hi>feeling</hi> of any thing but only of <hi>dreadful</hi> or <hi>hopeful, pleasant</hi> or <hi>painful</hi> Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And if this be so, then the way of the Holy Spirits working upon our minds, supposing that he works sutably to their natures, must be by <hi>inspiring</hi> or <hi>impressing</hi> them with thoughts. For as he is an infinite Spirit, he is <hi>always</hi> and <hi>every where</hi> present with our Spirits, and hath an <hi>immediate</hi> access to them, by vertue of which he can speak to our minds <hi>whenever</hi> and <hi>whatever</hi> he pleases, and also <hi>urge</hi> what he speaks with that <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> as to excite our most <hi>serious</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and attention; and by this it is that he <hi>ordinarily</hi> works upon us in order to the reducing us to God, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>inspiring</hi> such good thoughts into our minds as are most apt to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade</hi> us to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> the Gospel, and by a continued repetition of them <hi>urging</hi> and <hi>pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> them upon us in order to the reducing our <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>roving</hi> minds to a <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>serious</hi> attention to them. For it is very apparent that our <hi>Faith</hi> and all our good <hi>Resolutions</hi> are the <hi>immediate</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>serious</hi> consideration, <hi>I conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my ways,</hi> saith <hi>David, and turned my feet unto thy Testimonies.</hi> So that in reducing us to <hi>God</hi> the great work of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is to reduce us to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58668:53"/>
a <hi>fix'd</hi> and <hi>steady</hi> consideration; which being once effected, there naturally follows a <hi>good</hi> reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, unless the Will be <hi>invincibly</hi> obstinate; and to this as naturally succeeds the <hi>actual</hi> return of the Soul to God. Now to reduce us to this fix'd consideration the Holy Ghost, in the first place, <hi>suggests</hi> good thoughts to our minds, and then to keep our minds <hi>fix'd</hi> and <hi>intent</hi> on them, that so our worldly <hi>cares</hi> or <hi>pleasures</hi> may not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us from them, he most importunately <hi>urges</hi> and <hi>repeats</hi> the same thoughts, or <hi>seconds</hi> them with a <hi>train</hi> and <hi>succession</hi> of new ones to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; so that unless we are <hi>incorrigibly</hi> obstinate against <hi>all</hi> good motions, we cannot avoid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them into our most <hi>serious</hi> consideration, and when they are <hi>there,</hi> they cannot fail of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in us good <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> which if we carefully <hi>cherish</hi> will soon determine in holy <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses</hi> and <hi>resolutions.</hi> In all which things, you see, it is only by <hi>impression</hi> of <hi>thoughts</hi> that the Holy Spirit operates on our minds. But this will more plainly appear by considering those <hi>particular</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations on our minds which the Scripture attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the Holy Ghost, all which may be ranked under these five Heads:

               <p>First, <hi>Illumination</hi> or <hi>informing</hi> our minds with the <hi>light</hi> of heavenly truth; thus <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 18.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58668:54"/>
the Apostle prays <hi>that the God of our Lord Iesus Christ, the Father of Glory, would give unto them the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him, that the eyes of their understanding being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, they might know what is the hope of Christ's calling, and what the riches of the glory of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the Saints</hi>; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. we are told, that it is by <hi>receiving the Spirit of God that we know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> Now this illumination of the Spirit is two-fold; first, External, by that <hi>revelation</hi> which he hath given us of God's <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and that <hi>miraculous</hi> evidence by which he <hi>sealed</hi> and <hi>attested</hi> it; <hi>for all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. or as it is elsewhere expressed, <hi>was delivered by holy men, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21. And all those <hi>miraculous</hi> testimonies we have to the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> of Scripture are, as hath been already proved, from the Holy Ghost, and upon that account are called, <hi>the demonstration of the Spirit.</hi> So that all that <hi>light</hi> we receive from Scripture, and all the <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> we have that <hi>that</hi> light is <hi>divine,</hi> we derive <hi>originally</hi> from the Holy Spirit. But besides this <hi>external</hi> illumination of the Spirit, there is also an <hi>internal</hi> one, which consists in <hi>impressing</hi> that external light and evidence of Scripture upon our <hi>understandings,</hi> whereby we are enabled more clearly to <hi>apprehend</hi> and more effectually to <hi>believe</hi> it. For though the divine Spirit doth not (at least in the <hi>ordinary</hi> course of his operation) illuminate our minds with any <hi>new</hi> truths, or <hi>new</hi> evidences of truth, but only presents to our
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58668:54"/>
minds those <hi>old</hi> and <hi>Primitive</hi> truths and evidences which he at first revealed and gave to the World, yet there is no doubt but he still continues not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>suggest</hi> them both to our minds, but to <hi>urge</hi> and <hi>repeat</hi> them with that <hi>importunity,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to imprint them with that <hi>clearness</hi> and <hi>efficacy,</hi> as that if we do not through a <hi>wicked</hi> prejudice against them <hi>wilfully</hi> divert our minds from them to <hi>vain</hi> or <hi>sinful</hi> objects, we must unavoidably <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend</hi> them far more <hi>distinctly,</hi> and <hi>assent</hi> to them far more <hi>cordially</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we <hi>should</hi> or <hi>could</hi> have done. For alas! our minds are naturally so <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>stupid,</hi> so <hi>giddy, listless,</hi> and <hi>inadvertent,</hi> especially in <hi>spiritual</hi> things which are <hi>abstract</hi> from common sence, as that did not the Holy Spirit frequently <hi>present,</hi> importunately <hi>urge,</hi> and thereby <hi>fix</hi> them on our minds, our <hi>knowledge</hi> of them would be so <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> and our <hi>belief</hi> so <hi>wavering</hi> and <hi>unstable,</hi>as that they would never have any <hi>prevailing</hi> influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on our <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi> So that our <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>belief</hi> of divine things, so far forth as they are <hi>saving</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> to our renovation, are the fruits and products of this <hi>internal</hi> illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another of these ordinary operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit is <hi>Sanctification</hi>; which consists in the <hi>purifying</hi> our Wills and Affections from those wicked <hi>Inclinations</hi> and inordinate <hi>Lusts,</hi> which <hi>countermand</hi> God's Will in us, and set us at <hi>enmity</hi> against him; and <hi>this</hi> also the Scripture attributes to the Holy Spirit. So <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>For according to his mercy he saveth us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost</hi>;

and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified, in the name of our Lord Iesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> And this is the meaning of our being <hi>sealed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> so often mentioned in the New Testament, <hi>viz.</hi> our receiving his <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Impression</hi> from him; which consists in <hi>holiness</hi> and <hi>righteousness,</hi> and by this Image or Impression we are <hi>discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> and <hi>set apart</hi> from the rest of the World, as <hi>a chosen Generation, a royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, and a peculiar People,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. <hi>and made Kings and Priests unto God,</hi> Rev. 1.6. upon which account we are said to be <hi>anointed by the Spirit,</hi> 1 John 2.20. and by the same Image we are also <hi>intitled</hi> to, and <hi>secured</hi> of all the blessings of the New Covenant: upon which account it is called, <hi>The earnest of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>the first-fruits of the Spirit.</hi> And this Image of himself the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost produces in us by suggesting to our minds the powerful <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> of Religion, and by often reiterating, imprints them upon us with all their native <hi>force</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> in the most <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>affecting</hi> Characters; and by these his blessed suggestions he by degrees <hi>perswades</hi> and <hi>bends</hi> our <hi>stubborn</hi> Wills, <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And accordingly we find the Ages of <hi>Persecution</hi> abounding with <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable</hi> instances of <hi>this</hi> operation of the Holy Ghost. For whereas constant <hi>Persecutions</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed to exterminate <hi>false</hi> Religions from

the World, witness the <hi>Heathen</hi> Religion and the Christian <hi>Heresies,</hi> the <hi>Priscillians, Arians,</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi> which whilst they were <hi>tolerated</hi> or <hi>connived</hi> at, did mightily <hi>encrease</hi> and <hi>multiply,</hi> but under <hi>vigorous</hi> persecutions immediately <hi>shrunk,</hi> and in a little time <hi>dwindled</hi> into nothing; the <hi>true</hi> Christianity, on the contrary, <hi>bore up</hi> its head under the <hi>heaviest</hi> oppressions, and <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed</hi> in the midst of <hi>flames,</hi> and was so far from being <hi>vanquished</hi> by all the <hi>barbarous</hi> cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of its Persecutors, that the more they <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted</hi> it, the more it <hi>conquered</hi> and <hi>prevailed,</hi> which doubtless is in a great measure to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to this <hi>supporting</hi> influence of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which still accompanied its <hi>Confessors</hi> and <hi>Martyrs.</hi> For how was it possible that a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>tender</hi> Virgins, <hi>delicate</hi> Matrons, and <hi>aged</hi> Bishops could ever have endured those <hi>long</hi> and <hi>dolorous</hi> Martyrdoms, as many times they did, when their Tormentors <hi>took</hi> their <hi>turns</hi> from morning to night, and <hi>plied</hi> them with all <hi>kinds</hi> of cruelties, till they were oftentimes forced to <hi>give over,</hi> and <hi>confess</hi> that they had not <hi>heart</hi> enough to <hi>inflict</hi> the Tortures which those poor Sufferers had <hi>courage</hi> enough to <hi>endure?</hi> How could they have <hi>sung</hi> in the midst of Flames, <hi>smiled</hi> upon Racks, <hi>triumphed</hi> upon Wheels and <hi>Catastaes,</hi> and there <hi>challenged</hi> their Executioners, as they often did, to <hi>distend</hi> their Limbs to the <hi>utmost</hi> stretch, to <hi>tear</hi> their flesh with <hi>Vngulae,</hi> to <hi>scorch</hi> their tender parts with fires, and <hi>rake</hi> their bowels with <hi>Spikes</hi> and <hi>Gaunches?</hi> How, I say, could they have endured all these <hi>miserable</hi> harrasings of their tender flesh with the most <hi>witty</hi> and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58668:58"/>
                  <hi>exquisite</hi> Tortures, and this sometimes for sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry days <hi>together,</hi> when for one <hi>base</hi> and <hi>coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> word they might have been <hi>released</hi> when they <hi>pleased,</hi> had they not been <hi>supported</hi> with an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible</hi> hand, and <hi>refreshed</hi> with such <hi>strong</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations, as not only <hi>abated,</hi> but sometimes quite <hi>extinguished</hi> their pains? And the <hi>same</hi> comforts, though not perhaps in the same <hi>degree,</hi> other good men have <hi>frequently</hi> experienced; sometimes upon their undertaking some <hi>great</hi> and <hi>Heroick</hi> Office of Piety or Vertue, sometimes in their <hi>conflict</hi> with some <hi>great</hi> Temptation, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when they have been sorely <hi>oppressed</hi> with some <hi>mighty</hi> sorrow or affliction, and sometimes in the <hi>hour</hi> and <hi>extremities</hi> of Death; for it is only upon <hi>these</hi> or such like <hi>extraordinary</hi> occasions that the Holy Spirit usually administers these <hi>great</hi> Consolations to our minds. And this he also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms in the <hi>same</hi> manner as he doth the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named operations, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>suggesting to,</hi> and vigorously <hi>impressing</hi> comfortable thoughts <hi>upon</hi> our minds; for there is no doubt but that as he can impress on us what <hi>thought</hi> soever he pleases, so he can also impress it with what <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour</hi> soever he pleases, and accordingly as he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses a comfortable thought on us <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> vigorously, it must of necessity be a <hi>greater</hi> or a <hi>less</hi> consolation to us; if he think <hi>fit,</hi> and our state <hi>require</hi> it, he can imprint a comfortable thought on us with that <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>vehemence,</hi> as that it shall even <hi>ravish</hi> us from our <hi>sense,</hi> and so <hi>ingross</hi> all our attention to it as that we shall be altogether <hi>mindless</hi> and <hi>insensible</hi> of any <hi>pain</hi> or <hi>pleasure</hi> of the body. For thus it is usual
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58668:58"/>
for <hi>serious</hi> Contemplators in their <hi>profound</hi> Muses to collect and call together <hi>all</hi> their animal spirits to attend that work, so as that many times there are <hi>none,</hi> or not <hi>enough</hi> at least remaining to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Offices of their <hi>sense,</hi> and carry on the <hi>inferiour</hi> operations of Nature; and if we our selves by <hi>intense</hi> thinking can thus <hi>alienate</hi> our minds from <hi>sense,</hi> we may easily suppose that the Holy Ghost, who hath the <hi>command</hi> of our minds, can when he pleases stamp a <hi>joyous</hi> thought so <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously</hi> upon them, as that it shall instantly <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport</hi> them into an <hi>ecstasie,</hi> and <hi>ravish</hi> them from all <hi>Corporeal</hi> sensation. And that <hi>thus</hi> he <hi>hath</hi> done is notoriously evident in the above-named <hi>Martyrs,</hi> whose <hi>Senses</hi> were many times so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranced</hi> by the <hi>rapturous</hi> contemplations their <hi>minds</hi> were <hi>seised</hi> with, that they lay <hi>smiling</hi> and sometimes <hi>singing</hi> under the bloudy hands of their Tormentors, without any <hi>apparent</hi> sense of those <hi>long</hi> and <hi>exquisite</hi> cruelties that were practised upon them. And though the blessed Spirit sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom applies these <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> Cordials to pious minds but in such <hi>great</hi> and <hi>urgent</hi> extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, it being much more for their interest to be kept <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>lowly</hi> than to be <hi>ravished</hi> with continued comforts, yet <hi>ordinarily</hi> he administers a <hi>standing</hi> peace and satisfaction to them, and when ever their necessities <hi>call</hi> for it, he inspires them with such <hi>degrees</hi> of joy and consolation as their case and condition <hi>requires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly and lastly, Another of these ordinary operations of the Holy Spirit on Men's minds is <hi>Intercession,</hi> by which he <hi>enables</hi> us to offer up our Prayers to God with such <hi>ardent</hi> and <hi>devout</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58668:59"/>
as are in some measure sutable to the <hi>matter</hi> we pray for. For Prayer being the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>converse</hi> of our Souls with God, wherein our minds are obliged to <hi>withdraw</hi> themselves from <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> things, and wholly to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi> themselves from those Objects to which they are most <hi>endeared</hi> and <hi>familiarized,</hi> into the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> world, there is no one duty whatsoever to the due performance of which our <hi>carnal</hi> affections are naturally more <hi>listless</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi>; and therefore as herein we have most <hi>need</hi> of the Holy Spirit's assistance, so herein he more <hi>especially</hi> operates on our minds, <hi>exciting</hi> in us all those <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> which are proper to the several parts of our Prayer, such as <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>sorrow</hi> in the <hi>confession</hi> of our sins; a <hi>sense</hi> of our <hi>need</hi> of mercy, and a <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>obtaining</hi> it in our <hi>supplications</hi> for <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>forgiveness; resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to God's <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> on his <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> in our address for <hi>temporal</hi> mercies and deliverances; <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirst</hi> after <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in our <hi>Petitions</hi> for his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>assistance</hi>; and in a word, <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of God in our <hi>praises</hi> and <hi>thanksgivings</hi> for <hi>mercy</hi>; and in these <hi>divine</hi> affections the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> of Prayer consists. And accordingly in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. the Apostle tells us, <hi>Because ye are Sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father</hi>; that is, by kindling <hi>devout</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> affections in your Souls, enabling you to cry to God with all <hi>earnestness</hi> and <hi>assurance,</hi> as to a <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Father; and hence also we are said to pray <hi>in</hi> or <hi>by</hi> the Holy Ghost, <hi>Iude</hi> 20. because all the proper <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:58668:59"/>
of Prayer are <hi>excited</hi> in us by him. And this his excitation of the graces of Prayer in us is called his <hi>making Intercession for us, Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. which imports no more than his <hi>enabling</hi> us to offer up the <hi>matter</hi> of our Prayers to God in a most <hi>devout</hi> and <hi>affectionate</hi> manner, or as he there explains himself, <hi>with sighs and groans that are not to be uttered,</hi> that is, with such <hi>earnest</hi> and <hi>fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant</hi> affections as are too <hi>big</hi> for <hi>words</hi> to express. And this is properly to <hi>intercede</hi> for us. For as Christ, who is our Advocate in <hi>Heaven,</hi> doth <hi>offer up</hi> our Prayers to the Father, and <hi>enforce</hi> them with his own <hi>Intercessions</hi>; so his Spirit, who is our Advocate on <hi>Earth,</hi> begets in us those <hi>affections</hi> which render our Prayers <hi>prevalent,</hi> and wings them with <hi>fervour</hi> and <hi>ardency</hi>; the one pleads with God for us in our <hi>own hearts,</hi> by <hi>kindling</hi> such <hi>desires</hi> there as render our Prayers <hi>acceptable</hi> to him, and the other pleads with him for us in <hi>Heaven,</hi> by <hi>presenting</hi> those <hi>desires,</hi> and <hi>soliciting</hi> their <hi>supply</hi> and <hi>acceptance.</hi> Now this <hi>Intercession</hi> of the Holy Spirit is also performed, as all the aforegoing operations, by <hi>suggesting to,</hi> and <hi>imprinting</hi> such thoughts <hi>upon</hi> our minds, as are most apt to <hi>raise</hi> and <hi>excite</hi> our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which thoughts he often <hi>urges</hi> with that <hi>vehemence,</hi> and <hi>presses</hi> with that reiterated <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,</hi> that if we do not wilfully <hi>repel</hi> them from our <hi>minds,</hi> and <hi>refuse</hi> them admittance to our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> they cannot fail to stir up in us all the <hi>graces</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>enflame</hi> our Souls with a servent devotion; and accordingly whenever we <hi>harbour</hi> these suggestions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by seriously attending to them <hi>cherish</hi>

               <p>And thus I have given a brief account both of what the Holy Spirit <hi>hath</hi> done, and of what he still <hi>continues</hi> to do towards the <hi>promoting</hi> and <hi>effectuating</hi> of Christ's Mediation <hi>for</hi> God <hi>with</hi> men. And by what hath been said it abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears that he hath done for us, and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to do all that our <hi>case</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> requires; and that there is nothing imaginable wanting on <hi>his</hi> part towards the <hi>reducing</hi> and <hi>reconciling</hi> our minds to God. So that now he may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say to us what God doth to his Vineyard, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.4. <hi>What could I have done more for my Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard that I have not done?</hi> Or, as the Hebrew expresses it, <hi>What is to be done more?</hi> Not but that by his <hi>omnipotent</hi> power <hi>absolutely</hi> considered, the Holy Spirit <hi>can</hi> do more for us than he <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily</hi> doth; he <hi>can</hi> in an <hi>instant</hi> infuse a <hi>new</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into us in despite of all the <hi>resistance</hi> of our <hi>Wills,</hi> and make such <hi>irresistible</hi> impressions on our minds as our most <hi>inveterate</hi> prejudice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity against God shall never be able to <hi>withstand</hi>; but then his <hi>power</hi> always acts by the direction of his <hi>wisdom,</hi> and can do no <hi>otherwise,</hi> that is, it can do no more than it can <hi>wisely</hi> do; and it is certain that <hi>ordinarily</hi> and <hi>regularly</hi> it cannot <hi>wisely</hi> so act upon men as to <hi>determine</hi> their natural <hi>liberty</hi> to good and evil; since by so doing he must not only commit a perpetual <hi>violence</hi> on the <hi>frame</hi> of our <hi>Beings,</hi> and thereby

                  <hi>reverse</hi> the established <hi>course</hi> of our <hi>natures,</hi> but also destroy the very <hi>being</hi> of <hi>Vertue</hi> in us, which is no longer Vertue than while it is <hi>free</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constrained.</hi> But whatsoever he can <hi>wisely</hi> do, or, which is all one, <hi>consistently</hi> with the liberty of <hi>our</hi> nature, he <hi>hath</hi> done, and still <hi>continues</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So that now to the reduction of our Souls to God there is nothing wanting but our own <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> and free <hi>co-operation,</hi> which if we <hi>will</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse we <hi>may</hi>; for for desperate <hi>obstinacy</hi> there is no <hi>remedy</hi>; if <hi>we</hi> will <hi>not</hi> comply with the blessed Spirit, it is certain <hi>he</hi> will not <hi>save</hi> us whether we <hi>will</hi> or <hi>no.</hi> So that when <hi>inquisition</hi> shall be made for the <hi>bloud</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> the utmost we can charge <hi>him</hi> with is, that he did not <hi>drag</hi> us to Heaven in <hi>spite</hi> of our <hi>teeth,</hi> and <hi>bind</hi> up our <hi>hands</hi> in the Cords of an <hi>irresistible</hi> Fate to <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> us from <hi>murdering</hi> our selves; but if <hi>we</hi> have so <hi>little</hi> regard of <hi>our selves</hi> as to <hi>spurn</hi> at our own happiness, it is by no means fit that <hi>he</hi> should <hi>force</hi> it upon us, and it would be a very <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> condescension in him to <hi>prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> his grace to such as <hi>scorn</hi> and <hi>refuse</hi> it.

               <head>SECT. II. Concerning the <hi>particular</hi> Offices of Christ's Mediation.</head>
               <p>FOR the clearer stating what are the <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Offices of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> it will be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry briefly to enquire into the <hi>state</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> of the <hi>Parties</hi> between <hi>whom</hi> he Mediates, as they stand <hi>related</hi> to one another. For he being to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate <hi>for,</hi> and <hi>between</hi> God and Man, to be sure his Offices must be such as their <hi>respective</hi> states and conditions do <hi>require.</hi> For how can he offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate <hi>effectually</hi> between them, unless he performs all those good Offices on <hi>both</hi> sides, which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering their states as they stand <hi>related</hi> to one another, are necessary to create a mutual <hi>accord</hi> and <hi>agreement</hi> between them? Now the state of <hi>God</hi> as he stands related to <hi>us,</hi> is that of a <hi>supreme</hi> and <hi>absolute</hi> Sovereign over <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>rebellious</hi> Subjects, who were so far <hi>depraved</hi> and <hi>degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> as that we neither <hi>understood</hi> his Will, nor were at all <hi>disposed</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> it. Wherefore that he might officiate effectually for <hi>God</hi> with <hi>us,</hi> his <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> and <hi>rebellious</hi> Subjects, it was necessary, First, that he should perform the Office of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> in <hi>revealing</hi> God's Will and pleasure to us, of which the whole Race of Mankind was so <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorably</hi> ignorant. Secondly, That he should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Office of a <hi>King,</hi> in <hi>exacting</hi> our <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to God, and <hi>subduing</hi> our <hi>stubborn</hi> Wills to his heavenly <hi>pleasure</hi>; so that in officiating for
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58668:61"/>
                  <hi>God</hi> with <hi>us,</hi> it was necessary that he should both <hi>teach</hi> us as God's <hi>Prophet,</hi> &amp; <hi>rule</hi> us as God's <hi>King.</hi> And then the state of man as it respects God, is that of a most <hi>guilty</hi> and <hi>criminal</hi> Subject, who by a continued course of Rebellion had justly and highly <hi>incensed</hi> and <hi>provoked</hi> his Sovereign Lord against him, in which state of things it was highly necessary that in officiating for <hi>us</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> our Mediator should in the first place, render him some <hi>great</hi> and <hi>honourable</hi> reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>our</hi> behalf, such as he in his infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom should think meet to <hi>exact</hi> for those <hi>high</hi> and <hi>manifold</hi> affronts and Indignities which <hi>we</hi> had offered to his <hi>Sacred</hi> Person and Authority. For without some <hi>such</hi> reparation he could not well have admitted of <hi>any</hi> reconciliation with us, without <hi>prostituting</hi> his own Authority, and rendring it <hi>cheap</hi> and <hi>vile</hi> in the eyes of <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>insolent</hi> Offenders. Now the <hi>greatest</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration he could make for us was to take <hi>our</hi> punishment on <hi>himself,</hi> by offering up his <hi>own life</hi> to God as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the sins of the World. And then, secondly, it was necessary that having made this reparation for us, he should thereupon become our <hi>Advocate,</hi> and <hi>plead</hi> his Sacrifice to God in <hi>our</hi> behalf, that for the <hi>sake</hi> thereof he would be so far <hi>propitious</hi> to us as to <hi>admit</hi> us upon our <hi>unfeigned</hi> repentance, to his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour.</hi> Both which are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>Priestly</hi> Office, which consists, as I shall shew hereafter, in <hi>atoning</hi> God with <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> So that the <hi>particular</hi> Offices which the <hi>respective</hi> states of God and Man require of him that Mediates <hi>between</hi> them, is to <hi>teach</hi> and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58668:62"/>
                  <hi>rule</hi> for God, and to <hi>expiate</hi> and <hi>Advocate</hi> for men.</p>
               <p>But for the better understanding of these particular Offices it is necessary we should briefly consider the <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of them, and explain in what <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> the Mediator hath <hi>proceeded</hi> and <hi>advanced</hi> in the <hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>administration</hi> of them. Which in short was thus; by <hi>Commission</hi> from God the Father he <hi>came down</hi> into this World, where the <hi>first</hi> Mediatorial Office he undertook was that of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> in the discharge whereof he made a full <hi>revelation</hi> of God's Mind and Will to the World. And having <hi>performed</hi> this, at least so far as was <hi>needful</hi> in his <hi>own</hi> Person, he next enters upon the first part of his <hi>Priestly</hi> Office, which was to make an <hi>expiation</hi> for the sins of the World, by the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of himself; and this being finished, he a little after proceeded to the <hi>other</hi> part, which was to make an <hi>Oblation</hi> of his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and in <hi>vertue</hi> thereof to <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> for us, and <hi>solicite</hi> our Pardon and admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion into the divine <hi>favour</hi>; upon the <hi>performance</hi> of all which, and as a glorious <hi>reward</hi> of it, he was admitted to <hi>sit down</hi> at the <hi>right hand</hi> of God in the Throne of <hi>Regal</hi> Authority <hi>next</hi> and <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> to the Father. For so <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. the Apostle tells us, <hi>He humbled himself, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient to the death, even the death of the Cross; wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name, that at the name of Iesus every Knee should bow.</hi> And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. his <hi>sitting down at the right hand of the Throne of God</hi> is the consequence of his <hi>enduring
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58668:62"/>
the Cross, and despising the shame of it.</hi> So that in short, the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> in which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his Mediatorial Offices was this; First, he <hi>Prophesied,</hi> then he made <hi>expiation</hi> for our sins on the Cross, then presented his Expiation in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and therein began to <hi>Advocate</hi> or <hi>intercede</hi> for us; and then he received that <hi>Regal</hi> Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by which he is to reign till the <hi>Consummation of all things.</hi> And therefore for the more <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> explication of these particular Offices, it will be most proper to treat of them in the same order wherein they are placed in the divine Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, beginning first with the <hi>Prophetick,</hi> thence proceeding to the <hi>Priestly,</hi> and thence to the <hi>Kingly</hi> Office.</p>

               <p>COnsidering the manifold <hi>Errors,</hi> and the deep <hi>Ignorance</hi> in which Mankind was almost universally <hi>lost</hi> and <hi>bewilder'd,</hi> it was absolutely necessary that he who Mediated for <hi>God</hi> with <hi>men,</hi> in order to the <hi>reconciling</hi> them to him, should in the first place take care to <hi>inform</hi> them of the <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>instruct</hi> them in the <hi>Will</hi> of God; without which it was impossible for them so much as to know what it is to be reconciled to him. And accordingly this was the <hi>first</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial Office that our Saviour undertook,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58668:63"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Prophesie</hi> to the World, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>reveal</hi> and <hi>publish</hi> the Gospel to Mankind, wherein the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> of God, and the <hi>Method</hi> of our Salvation, are plainly <hi>stated</hi> and <hi>described,</hi> so far forth at least as it is necessary to <hi>our</hi> reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to him. Upon which account he is called <hi>the Light of the World, the Sun of Righteousness, the Way,</hi> and <hi>the Truth,</hi> and <hi>the bright Morning Star</hi>; all which refer to his <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office, which is the fountain of all that <hi>spiritual</hi> light that shines through the World. For long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour was born, it was <hi>foretold</hi> of him that he should execute the Office of a <hi>Prophet</hi>; so <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. <hi>The Lord thy God shall raise up unto thee a Prophet, from the midst of thee, of thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, like unto me, unto him ye shall hearken</hi>; which prophecy <hi>S. Peter</hi> applies to our Saviour, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. And upon this and other Prophecies of the Old Testament it is evident, it was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>anticipation</hi> among the <hi>Iews</hi> in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's time, that the Messias should be a <hi>Prophet.</hi> For thus upon Christ's feeding five thousand men with five Loaves and two Fishes, they cried out, <hi>This is of a truth that Prophet that should come into the world,</hi> John 6.14. so upon his resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Centurion's Servant, <hi>they were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and glorified God, saying that a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was risen up among them,</hi> Luke 7.16. And so also his own Disciples stile him, <hi>A Prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office of Christ consisted not so much in <hi>foretelling</hi> of <hi>future</hi> events (though this he also did so far as it was <hi>needful</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:58668:63"/>
for the Church) as in <hi>expounding, declaring,</hi> and <hi>making known</hi> the Will of God to us by divine <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> For so, to <hi>Prophesie</hi> signifies no more than to speak <hi>from,</hi> or in the <hi>stead</hi> of another; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Prophet is only an Interpreter, but an Interpreter of God. And so also <hi>Dionys.</hi> the <hi>Areop.</hi> stiles the Prophets <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Fathers of secret wisdom, <hi>Epist.</hi> 9. because they discovered those things to the World which were discoverable only by divine inspiration. And in this <hi>large</hi> sence of the word, Christ's <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office is to be understood, <hi>viz.</hi> as a <hi>declaring</hi> and <hi>signifying</hi> the Will of God to Mankind, concerning the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of our <hi>reconciliation</hi> to God, and eternal <hi>salvation</hi> by him. But for the fuller ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this his Mediatorial Office, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour first, to shew how <hi>excellently</hi> he was <hi>fitted</hi> and <hi>accomplished</hi> for it; and secondly, how <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> he hath <hi>discharged</hi> it. As for the first, how <hi>excellently</hi> he was <hi>fitted</hi> and <hi>accomplished</hi> for this Office will evidently appear by these three considerations:</p>
               <p n="1">I. That when he came down to <hi>Prophesie</hi> to us, he came <hi>immediately</hi> from the bosom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For as he was the <hi>Eternal</hi> Son of God he was always <hi>with</hi> him from all Eternity, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>intimate</hi> and infinitely <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar</hi> to him; and therefore as <hi>such,</hi> must not only be supposed fully to <hi>comprehend</hi> his <hi>Nature,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:58668:64"/>
and perfectly to <hi>know</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> but also to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to his most secret <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Councils.</hi> And it is upon this account perhaps chiefly that he is called the <hi>Logos,</hi> or <hi>Word of God,</hi> because as <hi>S. Gregory Nazianzen</hi> discoursed, <hi>Orat.</hi> 36. he hath the same relation to God the Father that a <hi>word</hi> or <hi>inward thought</hi> hath to the <hi>mind</hi>; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of his <hi>generation</hi> without any <hi>passion,</hi> but because of his intimate <hi>conjunction</hi> with him, by which he perfectly <hi>understands</hi> him, and so hath full power to <hi>declare</hi> him. For the <hi>Father</hi> is known, saith he, by the <hi>Son,</hi> and the Son is a <hi>brief</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> demonstration of the Father, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is begotten is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent word</hi> of that which begat it. So that as it is the Office of our <hi>Speech</hi> to <hi>declare</hi> our <hi>Minds</hi> to one another, so it is the Office of this <hi>Eternal Word</hi> of the Father to declare his <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> to the World; and who can be so proper to declare the Father's mind to us as he who from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath been so familiar to his inmost <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>purposes?</hi> Hence <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> John 1.18. <hi>No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him</hi>; and indeed his being in the <hi>bosom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, i. e.</hi> being most <hi>near</hi> and <hi>intimate</hi> to him, did perfectly qualifie him to <hi>declare him</hi>; for in that <hi>nearness</hi> and <hi>intimacy</hi> he could not but have a most perfect knowledge of him, and this not by the <hi>Instructions</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> nor by <hi>Dreams</hi> or <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> as other Prophets had; no nor <hi>meerly</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> neither, but by an immediate <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Intuition</hi> of his Father's <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> which from all Eternity were exposed to his <hi>view</hi> and <hi>prospect.</hi>

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:58668:65"/>II. It is also to be considered, that as he came down immediately <hi>from</hi> God, to Prophesie to us, so he came down into our <hi>own</hi> nature, which gave a vast advantage to his ministry. For had he preached to <hi>us,</hi> as he did to the <hi>Iews,</hi> from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in his divine person, the Glory and Majesty thereof would have so <hi>amazed</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded</hi> us, that like them we should not have been able to <hi>attend</hi> to him, and our minds would have been so <hi>struck</hi> with the terrible <hi>manner</hi> of his Ministry, that we could never have fixed our thoughts as we ought upon the <hi>matter</hi> of it. For so the Jews upon God's preaching <hi>personally</hi> to them, in the proper equipage of his divine Majesty, were struck with such a sacred <hi>Horrour,</hi> as that they were not able to <hi>bear</hi> it, but made it their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest that they might not hear the <hi>voice of the Lord</hi> any more, and that for the future he would speak with them by <hi>Moses,</hi> whose voice they could more easily <hi>bear,</hi> and better <hi>attend</hi> to; which request of theirs God thought so reasonable, that he promises to raise up unto them a Prophet of their own Brotherhood, like unto <hi>Moses,</hi> meaning the <hi>Word incarnate,</hi> and bids them <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to him, Deut.</hi> 18.15, 16. <hi>i. e.</hi> since you cannot <hi>endure</hi> to hear me speaking to you in the <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi> of my <hi>Divinity,</hi> I will hereafter <hi>allay</hi> and <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie</hi> it, by <hi>assuming</hi> one of your own <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>kindred</hi> into <hi>personal union</hi> with it; <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> whom I will vouchsafe to speak to you in such a <hi>familiar</hi> and <hi>condescending</hi> manner, as that you shall be able freely to attend without any <hi>terrour</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance.</hi> And indeed the most <hi>natural</hi> way of instructing <hi>humane</hi> minds is by <hi>humane</hi> means;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58668:65"/>
as for <hi>voices</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> or from <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> appearances on <hi>earth,</hi> they are more apt to <hi>confound</hi> than to <hi>edifie</hi> our understandings, and therefore for <hi>this</hi> reason, among <hi>others,</hi> Christ thought meet to assume our natures, that so he might treat with us in such a way as is most <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate</hi> thereunto, and deliver his <hi>divine</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to us in a humane <hi>form</hi> and <hi>voice,</hi> that so being conveyed to us in the most <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar</hi> manner, they might not so <hi>alarm</hi> our <hi>dread</hi> as to <hi>confound</hi> our <hi>attention,</hi> but might <hi>instruct</hi> our minds instead of <hi>scaring</hi> and <hi>amusing</hi> them. And therefore he did not only <hi>qualifie</hi> the <hi>terrour</hi> and <hi>dreadfulness</hi> of his divine Majesty by putting on <hi>our</hi> nature, but together <hi>with</hi> it he put on all the <hi>condescensions</hi> and <hi>sweetnesses</hi> of a most <hi>familiar</hi> and <hi>endearing</hi> conversation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed among men in such a <hi>generous, friendly,</hi> and <hi>courteous</hi> manner, as <hi>charmed</hi> and <hi>enamoured</hi> all <hi>ingenuous</hi> minds, and thereby <hi>attracted</hi> their <hi>attention</hi> to his Doctrine. So that as Christ was the Son of <hi>God</hi> he perfectly <hi>understood</hi> his Father's Will, and as he was the Son of <hi>Man</hi> he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fitted to <hi>reveal</hi> and <hi>declare</hi> it to Mankind.</p>
               <p>And as by being <hi>God-man</hi> he was most perfectly <hi>accomplished</hi> to <hi>declare</hi> God's Will to us, so he was also to give us a perfect <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to it; which, as I shall shew hereafter, was a necessary part of his <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office. For without assuming <hi>humane Nature</hi> he could never have been an example of <hi>humane Vertue,</hi> which consists in acting sutably to the nature of a <hi>Man,</hi> who is a Compound of <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Matter, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>Sense, Angel</hi> and <hi>Brute,</hi> from which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58668:66"/>
                  <hi>Principles</hi> there arise in him contrary <hi>incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> in the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof all humane <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists. How then could he have practised those vertues which consist in the dominion of <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> faculties over <hi>brutal</hi> and <hi>sensitive,</hi> such as <hi>Temperance, Chastity, Equanimity,</hi> and the like, had he not assumed that nature which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of <hi>both</hi>? How could he have shewn us by his <hi>own</hi> example how to govern the <hi>Passions,</hi> and conduct our selves in the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> had he not communicated with us in the Passions and Circumstances of <hi>humane Nature?</hi> He might have come down from the Heavens to us inrobed with <hi>splendor</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> or have preached his Gospel to the World in the midst of a <hi>Choir of Angels</hi> from some bright Throne in the Clouds, and it would have been more convenient for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> to have done so, because more sutable to the natural <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Majesty</hi> of his Person; but he consulted not so much his <hi>own</hi> convenience as <hi>ours</hi>; he knew well enough that his appearance among us in such an <hi>illustrious</hi> equipage would have been more apt to <hi>astonish</hi> than to <hi>instruct</hi> us, to have <hi>amused</hi> our thoughts into a profound ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his glories, than to have <hi>directed</hi> our steps in the paths of Piety and Vertue, and that it would be much more for <hi>our</hi> interest that he should <hi>conduct</hi> us by his <hi>example</hi> than <hi>amaze</hi> us by his <hi>appearance</hi>; and therefore he rather chose to appear to us in our <hi>own</hi> nature, that so by going before us as a <hi>man,</hi> he might shew us by his <hi>example</hi> what became <hi>men</hi> to do, and <hi>trace</hi> out to us the <hi>way</hi> to our happiness with the <hi>print</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:58668:66"/>
of his own <hi>footsteps.</hi> So that his coming among us in our <hi>own</hi> nature was of vast moment to his <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office, both in <hi>declaring</hi> his Father's <hi>Will</hi> to us, and setting us an <hi>example</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> to it.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And lastly, It is farther to be considered, that as he came down <hi>immediately</hi> from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Prophesie</hi> to us in our <hi>own natures,</hi> so while he abode among us he was <hi>always</hi> endued with the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; the <hi>Spirit of the Lord,</hi> from whom all <hi>Prophetick</hi> Inspiration proceeds <hi>rested</hi> on him, and made its constant <hi>residence</hi> and <hi>abode</hi> in his humane nature. So that whereas it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended upon other Prophets only at certain <hi>times,</hi> and upon certain <hi>occasions,</hi> by reason of which it was not in their power to Prophesie when they <hi>pleased,</hi> but they were fain to attend the <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> motions of the Holy Ghost, and, like dead Organ Pipes, were <hi>mute</hi> and <hi>silent</hi> as oft as he <hi>withdrew,</hi> and <hi>ceased</hi> to <hi>breath</hi> into them his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Enthusiasms</hi>; our blessed Saviour had the Prophetick Influx at <hi>command,</hi> and could Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie <hi>whensoever</hi> he pleased. For the Holy Ghost <hi>resided</hi> in his mind, and like an assisting <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Genius</hi> was <hi>always</hi> present with his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being, as was shewed before, <hi>subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> to him, both by personal <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> with the Father, it operated in him <hi>when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, howsoever,</hi> and <hi>whatsoever</hi> he pleased; and was as <hi>intirely</hi> at his disposal as his own most <hi>voluntary</hi> motions. So that whensoever he had occasion for a <hi>Revelation,</hi> he no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>willed</hi> it, but the Holy Ghost immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>inspired</hi> it into him, and whensoever he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58668:67"/>
wanted a <hi>Miracle</hi> to confirm a Revelation, he no sooner <hi>called</hi> for it but the Holy Ghost immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>exerted</hi> it by him. For, as I shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he did both <hi>Prophesie</hi> and effect his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> by the Holy Ghost that was <hi>in</hi> him, and that was so entirely <hi>subject</hi> to him through the <hi>whole</hi> course of his Ministry, that he could Prophesie, and do Miracles by him <hi>whensoever</hi> he pleased; and hence he is said to be <hi>anointed with the Holy Ghost, and with power,</hi> Acts 10.38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, to be consecrated to the Prophetick Office by the descent of the Holy Ghost upon him, by whom he was impowered to <hi>Prophesie,</hi> and to <hi>confirm</hi> his Prophecy by <hi>Miracles</hi>; for so it follows, <hi>He went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed with the Devil, for God was with him</hi>; and accordingly at his Baptism he was solemnly <hi>consecrated</hi> the great Prophet of God by a visible <hi>Vnction</hi> of the Holy Ghost, who, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, descended on him <hi>in a bodily form or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> Chap. 3. ver. 22. which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> thus expresses, <hi>the Spirit of God descended like a Dove, and light upon him,</hi> Chap. 3. ver. 16. not as if he descended in the <hi>form</hi> of a <hi>Dove,</hi> but, as it seems most probable, he assumed a body of <hi>light</hi> or <hi>fire,</hi> and therein came down from above, just as a Dove with its Wings spread forth is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to do, and gathering about our Saviour's head crowned it with a <hi>visible Glory.</hi> For so in the <hi>Nazaren</hi> Gospel, as <hi>Grotius</hi> observes, it is said that upon this descent of the Holy Ghost, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> there imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately shone a great light round about the place; and <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> tells us, that when Christ was
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58668:67"/>
Baptized, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that there was a fire lighted in the River <hi>Iordan,</hi> that is, by the reflection of that <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>flaming</hi> appearance, in which the Holy Ghost descended, the River seemed to be all on fire. So that as God did sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize his presence in the <hi>Old</hi> Tabernacle by a visible <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Glory,</hi> so the Holy Ghost by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending on our Saviour in this <hi>shining</hi> appearance, declared him to be the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of his divine Presence, wherein he meant from thenceforth to <hi>reside</hi> and make his constant <hi>abode,</hi> and from <hi>whence</hi> and by <hi>whom</hi> he would for the future com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himself to Mankind. And accordingly the sign which God gave to <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> by which he might know the Messias when he saw him, was this, <hi>Vpon whom thou shalt see the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit descending and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost, i. e.</hi> who from <hi>himself,</hi> or from his <hi>own</hi> fulness shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Holy Ghost to the World, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.33. For so <hi>full</hi> was Jesus of the Holy Ghost, that he not only prophesied <hi>himself,</hi> and did miracles by it whensoever he <hi>pleased,</hi> but he also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it to his own immediate <hi>Disciples,</hi> and impowered <hi>them</hi> to communicate it to <hi>others</hi>; and hence it is said, that <hi>God gave not the Spirit by measure to him,</hi> John 3.34. <hi>i. e.</hi> with <hi>limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>restrictions</hi> to such particular <hi>times,</hi> or <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>purposes,</hi> but in that <hi>unlimited</hi> manner, as that he could not only act by it himself <hi>when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever</hi> or <hi>howsoever</hi> he pleased, but also commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it to <hi>others</hi> in what <hi>degree</hi> or <hi>measure</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleased. For so <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.22. it is said, that <hi>he breathed upon his Disciples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bid them
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58668:68"/>
receive the Holy Ghost</hi>; and <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. we are told, that upon their <hi>laying their hands</hi> upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>they</hi> also <hi>received the Holy Ghost.</hi> And by this <hi>unlimited</hi> fulness of the Holy Ghost, which our Saviour received at his <hi>Baptism,</hi> he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly accomplished for his <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office. For the Holy Ghost <hi>abode</hi> in him <hi>after</hi> that visible glory in which he descended, <hi>disappeared,</hi> even throughout the <hi>whole</hi> course of his Ministry; and hence <hi>Luke</hi> 4.1. we are told, that <hi>being full of the Holy Ghost he returned from Iordan</hi>; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had finished his forty days Fast in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, he returned from thence <hi>in the power of the Spirit into Galilee,</hi> ver. 14. where in his own City of <hi>Nazareth</hi> he began to Prophesie, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and manifesting that <hi>the Spirit of the Lord was upon him,</hi> vers. 18, to 23. and at <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee</hi> he began to work Miracles, and thereby to <hi>manifest forth his Glory,</hi> Joh. 2.11. Thus by <hi>Prophesying,</hi> and confirming his Prophecies by <hi>Miracles,</hi> he exerted that <hi>fulness</hi> of the Holy Ghost which was communicated to him at his Baptism. And now, since <hi>before</hi> he came down to Prophesie to us he was from Eternity in the bosom of the Father, and since <hi>when</hi> he came down he was clothed in <hi>humane</hi> nature, and in that nature was inspired with such an <hi>unbounded</hi> fulness of the Holy Ghost, as that he could not only Prophesie <hi>himself,</hi> and confirm his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by <hi>Miracles,</hi> when he pleased, but also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate these his Gifts to <hi>others</hi> in what <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> and <hi>proportions</hi> he thought fit, to enable them to Prophesie for him wheresoever he thought meet to send them, what can we imagine farther
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58668:68"/>
necessary to <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>accomplish</hi> him for the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office?</p>
               <p>I proceed therefore in the next place to shew how <hi>throughly</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> he discharged this Office; which will plainly appear by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring briefly what those things were which as a <hi>Prophet</hi> he performed; all which are reducible to these six Heads:</p>
               <p>First, He made a full <hi>Declaration</hi> of his Father's <hi>Will</hi> to the World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He <hi>proved</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> what he had declared by <hi>Miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, He gave a perfect <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to what he had declared and proved to be his Father's Will.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He <hi>sealed</hi> his declaration with his <hi>own Bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, He <hi>instituted</hi> an <hi>Order</hi> of men to <hi>preach</hi> what he had declared to the World.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, He sent his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> when he left the World, to <hi>recollect</hi> and <hi>explain</hi> to those men what he had declared, and to enable <hi>them</hi> also to <hi>prove</hi> and <hi>assert</hi> it by <hi>Miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. He made a full <hi>Declaration</hi> of his Father's Will to the World, <hi>viz.</hi> in those <hi>Sermons, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,</hi> and <hi>Discourses</hi> of his which we find recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the four Evangelists, in which the <hi>whole</hi> Will of God concerning the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of our Salvation is <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>perfectly</hi> revealed. For thus <hi>S. Paul</hi> declares to the Elders of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that <hi>he had kept back nothing that was profitable for them, but had testified both to the Iews and Greeks repentance towards God, and Faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Lord Iesus Christ, Acts</hi> 20.20, 21. and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58668:69"/>
ver. 27. he tells them, that <hi>he had not shunned to declare unto them all the Counsel of God.</hi> Now it is certain that this <hi>whole Counsel of God,</hi> which he had preached, was only that account of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's <hi>Discourses</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> which <hi>S. Luke</hi> gives us in his Gospel, who, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us, was a follower of <hi>S.

Paul</hi> had <hi>taught</hi> and <hi>delivered</hi>; and if so, then <hi>the whole Counsel of God</hi> must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Gospel; and accordingly <hi>S. Luke</hi> tells his <hi>Theophilus</hi> in the beginning of his Gospel, <hi>That forasmuch as many had set forth a declaration of those things that were surely believed among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, it seemed good unto him also, having had a perfect understanding of all things from the first, to write them down in order, that he might know the certainly of those things wherein he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.</hi> From whence I infer, that supposing that <hi>S. Luke performed</hi> what he <hi>promised,</hi> his Gospel must contain a <hi>full</hi> declaration of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion.</hi> For, first, by promising to give an account of those things that were <hi>surely belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> among Christians, he engaged himself to give an <hi>entire</hi> account of <hi>Christianity,</hi> unless we will suppose that there were some parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity which the Christians of that time did not <hi>surely believe.</hi> Secondly, In promising to give an account of those things of which he had <hi>perfect understanding from the first,</hi> and in which his <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> had <hi>been instructed,</hi> he also engaged himself to give a <hi>compleat</hi> account of the <hi>whole</hi> Religion, unless we will suppose that there were <hi>some</hi> parts of this Religion which <hi>S. Luke</hi> did not <hi>perfectly

understand,</hi> and in which <hi>Theophilus</hi> had not been before <hi>instructed.</hi> And the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me may be said of the three other Evangelists, <hi>viz.</hi> that their Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels do severally contain <hi>all</hi> the <hi>necessary</hi> Articles of Christianity, though the <hi>last</hi> of them seems to have been wrote upon a more <hi>particular</hi> design<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And if the <hi>whole</hi> of Religion be contained in these Gospels, which are only <hi>Histories</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> then it cannot be denied but that he made a <hi>full</hi> revelation of God's Will to the World. It is true, there are sundry <hi>other</hi> divine Writings annexed to these Gospels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which together with them <hi>compleat</hi> the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Epistles</hi> of the Apostles; but these pretend not to declare any <hi>new</hi> Religion to the world. For as for the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> it is only an <hi>Historical</hi> account of the <hi>Preparations</hi> of Christ's <hi>Ministers</hi> for the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Gospel to the World which <hi>he</hi> had taught them, and of the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure in it, in despite of all those oppositions they met with. And as for the <hi>Epistles,</hi> they are partly <hi>Comments</hi> and <hi>Enlargements</hi> on our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Discourses,</hi> and partly <hi>Decisions</hi> of such <hi>Controversies</hi> as arose among them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Analogie</hi> of that <hi>Faith</hi> which our Saviour had before <hi>declared</hi> and <hi>revealed</hi>; but in all these Writings there is no <hi>one</hi> Article of Faith but what was <hi>before</hi> declared and defined in the <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Discourses</hi> of our Saviour. And then as for the <hi>Primitive Writers,</hi> who lived <hi>in</hi> or <hi>near</hi>

suspected of <hi>lying</hi> whose whole life was such an illustrious example of <hi>goodness</hi> and unspotted <hi>integrity</hi> of manners?

               <p n="4">IV. As a Prophet also he <hi>sealed</hi> his Doctrine with his <hi>bloud</hi>; which is the <hi>highest</hi> pledge that any Mortal can give of his <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>integrity.</hi> While he was <hi>preaching</hi> his Doctrine to the World, he foresaw all along that he must either <hi>recant</hi> it, or <hi>die</hi> for it; and therefore it is not imaginable that he would have proceeded to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge</hi> it, had he not <hi>believed</hi> it to be <hi>true.</hi> For what man in his wits would ever publish a <hi>lye</hi> to the world, when he knows beforehand he must either <hi>recant</hi> it with <hi>shame,</hi> or <hi>assert</hi> and <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> it with his <hi>bloud?</hi> But such was the nature of his Doctrine, that he could not <hi>believe</hi> it to be <hi>true,</hi> unless it <hi>were</hi> so; because the <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> of it depended upon matters <hi>of fact,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he could not be <hi>deceived</hi>; namely, that he was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> that he <hi>came down</hi> from him, and had <hi>dwelt with</hi> him in unspeakable glory and happiness from the foundations of

the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.5. upon the <hi>truth</hi> of which <hi>facts</hi> depended the <hi>Authority</hi> of his whole <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>; but whether these were <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false</hi> he could not be ignorant if he were in his wits, which no body can doubt, that considers the <hi>exactness</hi> of his <hi>Conversation,</hi> and the <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Now if he were <hi>first</hi> in Heaven, and was sent down from <hi>thence</hi> to preach to the World, there is no <hi>doubt</hi> to be made of the <hi>truth</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine</hi>; and whether he were or no <hi>he</hi> could not be ignorant; if he were <hi>not</hi> there, he not only died with a <hi>wilful</hi> lye in his mouth, which is not reasonably imaginable of a person of his <hi>unspotted</hi> Piety and Vertue, but he also pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished it to the World in his life, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he <hi>knew</hi> it to be a lye, and <hi>foresaw</hi> he must either <hi>dye</hi> for it, or shamefully <hi>recant</hi> it, which is not imaginable of a person of his <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>soundness</hi> of <hi>mind.</hi> So that considering that he could not but <hi>certainly</hi> know whether his Doctrine were <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> his sealing it with his bloud is an <hi>unanswerable</hi> attestation of the <hi>truth</hi> of it; and accordingly his <hi>bloud</hi> is made a great Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the truth of his Gospel, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.8. and <hi>S.

               <p n="5">V. As a Prophet he also <hi>instituted</hi> an <hi>Order</hi> of men to <hi>publish</hi> and <hi>declare</hi> his Doctrine to the World. Whilst the gift of Prophecy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58668:73"/>
in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, there were certain Schools called the <hi>Schools of the Prophets,</hi> in which men were trained up under some <hi>great</hi> and <hi>eminent</hi> Prophets, who were the Masters of those Schools, in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of divine things, and the <hi>practice</hi> of Piety and Vertue, that so being educated in <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> they might be the better <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> and <hi>qualified</hi> to receive the Prophetick <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux,</hi> and deliver God's Messages to the people. For out of these schools God <hi>ordinarily</hi> called those persons whom he <hi>imployed</hi> and <hi>sent forth</hi> to prophesie to their <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>People</hi>; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly our Saviour, when he began to <hi>revive</hi> the spirit of Prophecy in his <hi>own</hi> Person, (which from <hi>Malachi</hi> till then, which was for the space of four hundred years, had been utterly <hi>extinct</hi>) immediately erected a <hi>School of Prophets</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of his twelve <hi>Apostles</hi> and seventy <hi>Disciples,</hi> to whom, as it seems, he afterwards added thirty eight more, <hi>Vide Acts</hi> 1.15. over whom he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>presided</hi> as the great <hi>Master Prophet,</hi> in order to the <hi>instructing</hi> their <hi>minds</hi> in all divine wisdom, and <hi>forming</hi> their <hi>manners</hi> by the strictest rules of Piety and Vertue; that so, when ever occasion required, they might be duly qualified to <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> to the World. And accordingly as those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Masters of the <hi>Prophetick Schools</hi> had ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily <hi>their</hi> Scholars <hi>personally</hi> attending on them, and, upon emergent occasions, did frequently <hi>send</hi> them forth as their <hi>Ministers</hi> upon Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>Messages, Vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.1. and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>35. so our blessed Saviour kept <hi>his</hi> in ordinary <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance</hi> about him, that so they might <hi>hear</hi> his Doctrine, and <hi>see</hi> his Miracles, and <hi>observe</hi> his
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58668:73"/>
Conversation; and, upon particular occasions, he <hi>sent</hi> them forth as his <hi>Ministring Disciples</hi> to Prophesie in his name; <hi>Vid. Luke</hi> 10.1. And out of this <hi>Prophetick School</hi> of our Saviour the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Prophets of our Religion were <hi>called</hi> and <hi>sent</hi> forth to preach the Gospel through the World. For that his Gospel might be taught through all <hi>succeeding</hi> Ages to the end of the World, he <hi>first</hi> erected this <hi>sacred School,</hi> and when he was to <hi>leave</hi> it, he deposited a standing <hi>Commission</hi> in the hands of his twelve Apostles, whom he ordained to <hi>preside</hi> in it in <hi>his</hi> room, by which he impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not only to <hi>ordain</hi> and <hi>send</hi> forth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Disciples of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> to <hi>teach</hi> his Gospel to all Nations, but also to <hi>derive</hi> down the same authority to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors through all Generations to come; <hi>For as the Father hath sent me,</hi> saith he, <hi>so send I you, Iohn</hi> 20.21. and as <hi>he</hi> sent <hi>them,</hi> so <hi>they</hi> still sent <hi>others,</hi> and so in an <hi>uninterrupted</hi> line of <hi>Succession</hi> hath this Commission been <hi>handed</hi> and <hi>derived</hi> from one Generation to another; the <hi>Bishops</hi> who next succeeded the Apostles in presiding over the <hi>Sacred School,</hi> not only still ordaining <hi>other</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to succeed them, but also still admitting <hi>other</hi> Presbyters and Deacons, who are as the <hi>Disciples</hi> of that School to <hi>Minister</hi> under them in the propagation of the Gospel. Thus Christ as the Great <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Church hath erected a <hi>standing</hi> Prophetick <hi>School</hi> or <hi>Order</hi> of men autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>declare</hi> his Gospel to all succeeding Ages of the World.</p>

Indeed, as the Apostles were placed in a <hi>higher</hi> station than any of the <hi>rest,</hi> as being authorized by Christ to <hi>superintend</hi> and <hi>preside</hi> over them, so they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a <hi>peculiar</hi> Gift of the Holy Ghost, in which none of the rest <hi>communicated</hi> with them, and that was conferring by <hi>imposition of hands</hi> the Holy Ghost upon others.

of <hi>Samaria,</hi> he could not <hi>confer</hi> the Holy Ghost on them, but <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> are <hi>sent</hi> thither for that purpose, who <hi>laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost,</hi> verse 17. Now by thus deriving his Holy Spirit on his <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Disciples,</hi> the blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> still proceeded <hi>by them</hi> to <hi>Prophesie</hi> to the World, till through <hi>their</hi> Ministry he had fully <hi>consummated</hi> his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Office, and <hi>revealed</hi> and <hi>explained</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> Doctrine of the Gospel.

                  <hi>those</hi> who were to <hi>declare</hi> it to the <hi>World</hi>; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is impossible it should <hi>ever</hi> have been <hi>known</hi> to Mankind; but when once he had fully <hi>revealed</hi> it <hi>to</hi> them, and <hi>declared</hi> it <hi>by</hi> them, and transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their declaration by a <hi>standing Scripture</hi> to all succeeding Generations; to what end should he <hi>still</hi> proceed to make <hi>new</hi> Revelations of it, unless it were to gratifie mens <hi>sloth</hi> and <hi>idleness,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them from the trouble of <hi>searching</hi> and <hi>study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that Scripture in which he had taken care to <hi>transmit</hi> his Gospel to them? But though that blessed Spirit hath never been <hi>wanting</hi> to Mankind in any <hi>necessary</hi> assistance, yet when once he hath put things within our <hi>own</hi> power, he always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that <hi>we</hi> should do them, and not sit still with our hands in our Pockets, expecting that <hi>he</hi> should do them for us. Since therefore by <hi>transmitting</hi> to us the <hi>Scripture,</hi> he hath put it within the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of its Ministers to <hi>understand</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, he expects that they should exercise that power in a diligent <hi>study</hi> of those things which lead to the true understanding of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not depend upon <hi>new</hi> Revelations for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of that which he hath already <hi>sufficiently</hi> revealed to them. For thus till the whole <hi>Old Testament</hi> was finished, God continued the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi> in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, after which he immediately <hi>withdrew</hi> it, and wholly remitted his People to the conduct of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> who in their forty eight <hi>Cities,</hi> which were so many <hi>Vniversities</hi> for their education in divine Learning, diligently <hi>read</hi> and <hi>studied</hi> the Law, and thereby accomplished themselves to <hi>preach</hi> and <hi>explain</hi> it to the People. And in like manner
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58668:75"/>
God continued the <hi>same</hi> Spirit of Prophecy in the <hi>Christian</hi> Church till the whole <hi>New Testament</hi> was <hi>revealed</hi> and <hi>written,</hi> and <hi>Copies</hi> of it <hi>dispersed</hi> through all the Churches, and from thenceforth the Spirit of Prophecy <hi>ceased,</hi> and in the room of its first <hi>inspired</hi> Ministers there succeeded an <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary standing</hi> Ministry, who by their <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Industry,</hi> and diligent <hi>search</hi> of Scripture were to supply the defect of immediate <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and to qualifie themselves to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>instruct</hi> the several Flocks that were committed to their Charge. In short therefore, the <hi>Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> remained upon the Ministers of Christ till such time as it had fully <hi>revealed</hi> and clearly <hi>explained</hi> the Gospel to them, and when <hi>this</hi> was done, and they had <hi>transmitted</hi> its <hi>Revelations</hi> to writing, there could be no farther need of it, unless it be supposed either that he had not <hi>sufficiently</hi> reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gospel to them, or that he hath some <hi>new</hi> Gospel to reveal. And thus you see what it is that our Saviour hath done in the discharge of his <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office. And considering all, I know not what farther he could have <hi>added</hi> to <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> it, and to render his Prophecy <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>instruct</hi> the World. So that if after all these <hi>mighty</hi> performances we still remain in <hi>darkness</hi> and <hi>ignorance,</hi> the <hi>blame</hi> of it wholly redounds upon <hi>our selves</hi>; for <hi>he</hi> hath in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects <hi>abundantly</hi> performed <hi>his</hi> part towards the <hi>enlightening</hi> of the World, and <hi>chalked</hi> out to us the <hi>way</hi> to our happiness with such <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> lines, that if we are but <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>walk</hi> in it, we cannot <hi>mistake</hi> or <hi>wander</hi> from it; but if we will be so <hi>supine</hi> and <hi>negligent</hi> as to concern our

selves no more about it than if it were only a <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful</hi> description of the <hi>Road</hi> to <hi>Vtopia,</hi> or the <hi>High-way</hi> to the <hi>World</hi> in the <hi>Moon,</hi> it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible we should be <hi>throughly</hi> acquainted with it how <hi>plainly</hi> soever it is described. It is true, there are <hi>some</hi> Doctrines in Christianity which are not so <hi>clearly</hi> revealed, but that the most <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi> minds may be <hi>mistaken</hi> about them; but then <hi>these</hi> are such as are far remote from the <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> Articles, upon which our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends, all which are so <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> revealed, that there is nothing but a <hi>perverse</hi> Will, that is either <hi>prejudiced</hi> against them by some <hi>sinful</hi> affection, or through a <hi>profane</hi> disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of God and Religion utterly <hi>unconcerned</hi> about them, can hinder men from <hi>apprehending</hi> them; and if when the divine <hi>Light</hi> shines so <hi>clearly</hi> round about them, men will be so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as to <hi>shut</hi> their <hi>eyes</hi> against it, it is at their own <hi>eternal</hi> peril, and they are as justly accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for their <hi>ignorance,</hi> as if they had sinned against the clearest <hi>knowledge.</hi> For <hi>this,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>is the condemnation of the World, that light is come into the World, and men love darkness more than light.</hi> If therefore through any wicked <hi>prejudice</hi> against the truth, or through a profane <hi>neglect</hi> to enquire after it, we continue <hi>ignorant</hi> of it, this will be no <hi>excuse</hi> at all for our sinning <hi>against</hi> it, but we shall be as certainly condemned for our <hi>affecting</hi> Ignorance, and <hi>loving darkness more than light,</hi> as if we had sinned against the clearest <hi>light</hi> and <hi>conviction.</hi> For what a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous instance is it of <hi>stupidity</hi> and <hi>impiety</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to shut our eyes against <hi>that</hi> light which is of

Good God! what <hi>reverence</hi> have these wretched Creatures for <hi>thee,</hi> or what <hi>regard</hi> for <hi>themselves,</hi> that can thus receive <hi>thy</hi> Messages, and with them their <hi>own</hi> Eternal Fate, with the same <hi>unconcern</hi> and <hi>indifferency,</hi> as they would the most impertinent Tales of <hi>Bedlam?</hi> Wherefore as we regard either <hi>God</hi> or our <hi>own</hi> Souls, let us from henceforth be perswaded seriously to attend to this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>momentous</hi> Revelation of our Saviour, and throughly to <hi>inform</hi> our minds with its <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi>; for which end let us avoid, as much as in us lies, <hi>busying</hi> and <hi>entertaining</hi> our thoughts with <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>curious</hi> Speculations, or <hi>remote</hi> and <hi>disputable</hi> Opinions; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our selves to the study of things upon which

               <p>IN treating of which <hi>great</hi> and <hi>momentous</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I shall endeavour, first, to shew what the <hi>ancient</hi> Priesthood <hi>was,</hi> and in what <hi>Acts</hi> it consisted. Secondly, To prove that the ancient Priesthood in its proper Acts was a <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of the Priesthood of our Saviour. Thirdly, To explain the Priesthood, and Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Acts of our Saviour <hi>corresponding</hi> to that <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Priesthood, in which they were prefigured.</p>
               <p>First, What the ancient Priesthood <hi>was,</hi> and in what <hi>Acts</hi> it consisted. In the first Ages of the World it is evident, that in matters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>himself</hi> alone, every man was his <hi>own</hi> Priest. For thus in <hi>sacrificing</hi> to God upon their own <hi>particular</hi> accounts, both <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for <hi>themselves,</hi> but in <hi>Family-Sacrifices</hi> the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58668:77"/>
                  <hi>Father</hi> of the Family was the <hi>Priest,</hi> as is evident by <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Iob, Gen.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.5. And when Families were multiplied into <hi>Tribes</hi> and greater <hi>Societies,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of each Society was also the Supreme <hi>Priest</hi> of it; and hence before <hi>Aaron</hi> was consecrated, <hi>Moses,</hi> who was the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> officiated also as the <hi>Priest</hi> in that solemn Sacrifice by which the Covenant with <hi>Israel</hi> was confirmed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.6. And long before <hi>Moses, Melchisedeck,</hi> King of <hi>Salem,</hi> was also <hi>Priest of the most High God, Gen.</hi> 14.18. And it is evident that originally <hi>Kings</hi> were the <hi>High-Priests</hi> of their Countries. For so <hi>Aristotle</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> That they had the Government of all Sacrifices and Sacred Rites, and whatsoever was to be done to the holy Gods was done by them. And therefore the reason why <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> here is more particularly taken notice of under the Character of a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Priest,</hi> was, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there were no <hi>other</hi> Kings so but <hi>he,</hi> but perhaps because all other Kings that were Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with him were revolted to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> so that he only remained a <hi>Priest</hi> of the most <hi>High God.</hi> And in being a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Priest</hi> together, he was a Type of our Saviour, who was a <hi>Priest,</hi> not after the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but after the Order of <hi>Melchisedeck. Heb.</hi> 5.10. For in <hi>Aaron</hi> the <hi>Priestly</hi> Office was <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi> from the <hi>Kingly,</hi> which later remained in <hi>Moses,</hi> after he by the command of God had <hi>devolved</hi> the Priesthood, which was <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally</hi> in himself, upon his Brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> and so according to divine institution the <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:58668:78"/>
was to continue in the Family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> separate from the <hi>Regal</hi> Power, till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour, who reunited those Offices in <hi>himself,</hi> and became a <hi>Royal Priest</hi> after the ancient Order of <hi>Melchisedeck.</hi> For upon the separation of these Offices none could be a Priest of the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Order, but such as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from the Family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ could not be a Priest of <hi>that</hi> Order, because he descended from the Family of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and being of the <hi>Royal</hi> Lineage he resumed the <hi>Priestly</hi> Office from the House of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and joyned it to the <hi>Kingly</hi> Office again, with which it was <hi>originally</hi> united; by which he abrogated the Priesthood of the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Order, and in its room restored the ancient <hi>Melchisedecan</hi> or <hi>Royal</hi> Priesthood. And hence the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> observes, that Christ <hi>pertaineth to another Tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, for it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Iudah, of which Tribe</hi> Moses <hi>spake nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Priesthood,</hi> Heb. 7.13, 14. and therefore by being a Priest of a <hi>different</hi> Tribe from that to which the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Order was confined, he disannulled <hi>that</hi> Order, and erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>another</hi> in the room of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the ancient Order of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> which was <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Aaronical.</hi> Hence <hi>S.

Why from one Tribe to another, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Sacerdotal to the Regal, that so it might be both Regal and Sacerdotal; and this is the Mystery; the first Priesthood of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was <hi>Regal</hi>; the second was <hi>Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> in <hi>Aaron</hi>; the third was <hi>Regal</hi> again in Christ. For that which distinguished the <hi>Melchisedecan</hi> from the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Priesthood, was not, as some imagine, the difference of their <hi>Sacrifice, viz.</hi> that <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> sacrificed only <hi>inanimate</hi> things, whereas <hi>Aaron</hi> sacrificed <hi>Animals</hi> also; for that <hi>Melchisedeck sacrificed,</hi> there is no doubt, because he was Priest of the most high God, but that he sacrificed <hi>inanimate</hi> things only, such as <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> there is not the least intimation in Scripture; only it is said, that when he met <hi>Abraham he brought forth Bread and Wine, Gen.</hi> 14.18. that is, to refresh <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Soldiers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Battel with <hi>Chedorlaomer,</hi> as the manner was in those Countries, <hi>Vide Deut.</hi> 23.4. and <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8.15. and 6.15. And what is all this to his <hi>Sacrificing?</hi> But that he sacrificed <hi>Animate</hi> as well as <hi>Inanimate</hi> things, is evident, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause animal Sacrifices were <hi>generally</hi> used <hi>before</hi> the institution of the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Priesthood, and it is very improbable that he who was so eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Priest of the most High God should never offer the <hi>accustomed</hi> Sacrifices; but also because Christ's Sacrifice was an <hi>animate</hi> one, who was a Priest after <hi>Melchisedeck</hi>'s Order, and not of the Order of <hi>Aaron, Heb.</hi> 7.11. so that if the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between these two Orders consisted in this difference of their <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> Christ must be rather
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58668:79"/>
a Priest of the <hi>Aaronick</hi> than the <hi>Melchisedecan</hi> Order. And how could the Acts of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Aaron</hi> be <hi>Typical</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s, which is <hi>Melchisedecan,</hi> as the Scripture all along makes them, if they were of a <hi>different</hi> nature from those of <hi>Melchisedeck?</hi> How could <hi>Aaron</hi>'s <hi>bloudy</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices be Typical of our Saviour's Priesthood, which was after the Order of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> if <hi>Melchisedeck</hi>'s Priesthood admitted <hi>no</hi> bloudy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice? As to the <hi>Acts</hi> of their Priesthood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for any thing that appears to the contrary, these two Orders were the <hi>same,</hi> but in <hi>this</hi> they apparently differed, that whereas the <hi>Regal</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was <hi>united</hi> to <hi>Melchisedeck</hi>'s Priesthood, it was wholly <hi>separated</hi> from <hi>Aaron</hi>'s, who in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was the first <hi>High Priest</hi> in the World that was not a <hi>King</hi> as well as a <hi>Priest.</hi> The Priestly acts therefore of these two different Orders being the <hi>same,</hi> we shall better understand the nature of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Priesthood, though it be of the Order of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> by the account we have of the <hi>Aaronical,</hi> than by that of the <hi>Melchisede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Order; because the <hi>former</hi> is far more <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> than the <hi>later.</hi> For of the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Functions</hi> of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi>'s Priesthood there is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>little</hi> mention in Scripture, whereas those of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s are described <hi>at large</hi> in all their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Circumstances.</hi> The <hi>Priestly</hi> Office therefore in general consists in officiating <hi>for</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men <hi>with</hi> God, in order to the <hi>reconciling</hi> of God to them, and obtaining for them his <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Benediction.</hi> To which end there are two Offices necessary to be performed, First, to offer <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for them, and thereby to make some fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

                  <hi>reparation</hi> to God for their past <hi>sins</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations</hi>; Secondly, To <hi>present</hi> that Sacrifice to God, and in the <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> of it to <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> with God in their behalf in order to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing</hi> them to his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we read of the <hi>Iewish</hi> High Priest, who of all their other Priests was the most perfect <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Representative</hi> of Christ in his <hi>Priestly</hi> Office, and this more especially in Celebrating the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the great day of <hi>Expiation,</hi> that on this day he was appointed to bring the Beast to the door of the Tabernacle, which was set apart to <hi>die</hi> for the <hi>Sins</hi> of the People, and to <hi>kill</hi> it there with his <hi>own</hi> hands; by which action he did, as the Peoples <hi>Representative,</hi> offer a <hi>life</hi> to God as a <hi>reparation</hi> for those manifold sins, by which they had justly forfeited their <hi>own</hi> lives to <hi>him</hi>; after which he was to take the Bloud of it, and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> it before the Lord in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> sprinkling it seven times with his finger <hi>upon</hi> and <hi>before</hi> the Mercy-Seat, by which action he <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded</hi> with God to accept <hi>that</hi> Bloud in <hi>lieu</hi> of the <hi>forfeited</hi> lives of the People; and accordingly the whole performance is called <hi>making an Atonement for the Children of Israel for all their sins once a year,</hi> Lev. 16 34. But for the <hi>fuller</hi> explication of the <hi>Priestly</hi> Office, it is necessary we should briefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain these two essential <hi>Acts</hi> of it, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing,</hi> and <hi>presenting</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God by way of <hi>Intercession</hi> for the People.</p>
               <p>As for the first of these the Apostle tells us, that <hi>every High Priest is ordained to offer gifts and Sacrifices,</hi> Heb. 8.3. And that he <hi>is ordained for men in things pertaining unto God, that he may
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58668:80"/>
offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for sins,</hi> Heb. 5.1. It is true indeed to <hi>sacrifice,</hi> in a strict sence, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>kill</hi> the Sacrifice, seems not to have been so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the <hi>Priestly</hi> Office, as to <hi>present</hi> the <hi>bloud of the Sacrifice</hi> before the Lord by way of <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi> the <hi>later</hi> of which was so <hi>appropriate</hi> to the Priesthood, as that it was never allowed upon any occasion whatsoever for any but a <hi>Priest</hi> to perform it; but as for <hi>killing</hi> the Sacrifice, it seems that not only the <hi>Priests,</hi> but sometimes the <hi>Levites, vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.17. yea, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>People</hi> themselves were allowed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, <hi>vid. Lev.</hi> 4.24, 29, 33. though it is probable that the <hi>Levites</hi> were allowed it only in cases of <hi>necessity,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> only in <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> sacrifice; but in the <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>general</hi> Expiation wherein Christ's dying for the sins of the World was more eminently <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed</hi> and <hi>represented,</hi> not only the <hi>presenting</hi> the bloud of the Sacrifice, but the <hi>killing</hi> it too, was peculiarly <hi>appropriated</hi> to the <hi>Priesthood.</hi> So that though in <hi>private</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> Expiations the <hi>People</hi> had a right to sacrifice, or <hi>kill</hi> the <hi>Victim,</hi> yet in all <hi>publick</hi> ones, such as our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>'s was, that right was <hi>incommunicably</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Priesthood. Now the killing of those sacrifices which were designed for <hi>expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of sin, was a <hi>transferring</hi> of punishment from the <hi>People</hi> to the <hi>Victim</hi>; for, you must know, the <hi>Iews</hi> had two sorts of Laws, <hi>viz. Civil</hi> and <hi>Ritual</hi>; their <hi>Civil</hi> Laws were enforced according to their <hi>strictest</hi> sanction, with the <hi>Penalty</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> which Penalty, in many cases, allowed by God, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of this mitigation, that the life of a <hi>Beast</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:58668:81"/>
should be accepted in exchange for the forfeited life of the <hi>Offender.</hi> Their Ritual Laws were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with the Penalty of legal uncleanness, and being <hi>separated</hi> upon that account from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> and <hi>Publick Worship</hi>; which Penalty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was thus far relaxed, that if they offered the life of a <hi>Beast</hi> in Sacrifice, their uncleanness should be thereby <hi>purged,</hi> and themselves <hi>restored</hi> to the benefit of the publick Worship. In both which cases the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was evidently <hi>substituted</hi> to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the <hi>Offender,</hi> and in the first case he was substituted to suffer that <hi>very</hi> punishment which the Offender had incurred. And therefore you find that the <hi>greater</hi> Crimes were no otherwise to be expiated, but by the bloud of the Offender <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> whereas for <hi>lesser</hi> ones the bloud of a <hi>Beast</hi> was accepted, which is a plain Argument, that that punishment which in <hi>greater</hi> sins was <hi>exacted</hi> of the Criminal <hi>himself,</hi> was in the case of <hi>smaller</hi> sins <hi>transferred</hi> from the <hi>Criminal</hi> to the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and that the punishment of the <hi>Beast</hi> was <hi>instead</hi> of the punishment of the <hi>Man.</hi> And this is most evident in the case of the <hi>Scape-Goat,</hi> who upon the High Priest's laying his hands upon his head had the sins of the People <hi>transferred</hi> on him, and was thereby so <hi>polluted,</hi> that he <hi>defiled</hi> the <hi>man</hi> that led him into the Wilderness, who was therefore obliged before he returned to the Camp to <hi>lustrate</hi> himself by <hi>washing his Cloaths, and bathing his flesh in water, Lev.</hi> 16.26. And so also those <hi>expiatory</hi> Sacrifices, whose <hi>bloud</hi> was carried into the <hi>Holy place,</hi> and their <hi>bodies</hi> burnt <hi>without</hi> the Camp, had the sins of the People so <hi>imputed</hi> to them, and were so <hi>defiled</hi> by that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58668:81"/>
that they were ordered to be carried without the Camp <hi>immediately,</hi> lest they should defile the <hi>whole</hi> Congregation, and those who <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried</hi> them out and <hi>burnt</hi> them, were so far <hi>actually</hi> defiled by them, that it was unlawful for them to return to the Camp, till they were legally <hi>purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; which is a plain argument, that in these <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificial Expiations</hi> the <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>guilt</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> was still <hi>transferred</hi> upon the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that the death of <hi>these</hi> Sacrifices was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the death of <hi>those</hi> Criminals; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.11. we are told that <hi>it is the bloud, i. e.</hi> of the Sacrifice <hi>that maketh an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Soul.</hi> And indeed this was the sence which all Nations had of <hi>Expiatory Sacrifices, viz.</hi> that their <hi>death</hi> was instead of the <hi>Punishment</hi> due to the <hi>Offenders</hi> that offered them. For thus the <hi>Iews</hi> by making <hi>Expiation</hi> generally understand suffering <hi>Punishment</hi> for <hi>another</hi> in order to <hi>his</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>released</hi> from suffering it <hi>himself.</hi> For thus whereever it is said by them, <hi>Ecce me in Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem,</hi> the meaning is, <hi>En me in ejus locum, ut por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chijah</hi> and his Sons, <hi>i. e.</hi> Let the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions that happen to me be for an expiation of <hi>R. Chijah</hi> and his Sons. So when all the People were to say to the High Priest, <hi>Simus nos expiatio tua,</hi> the meaning was, <hi>In nobis fiat expiatio tua, nosque subeamus tuo loco quicquid tibi evenire debet:</hi> Let us be thy Expiation, that is, let thy Expiation

be made upon us, and let us undergo in thy stead whatsoever evil thou hast deserved, of which see more, <hi>Buxt. Lexic. Chald. p.</hi> 1078. And accordingly in the Form of Prayer they used at the <hi>killing</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> they plainly expressed the <hi>substitution</hi> of it in the <hi>room</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited lives, <hi>Obsecro Domine, peccavi, rebellis fui,</hi> &amp;c. O Lord I obsecrate, I have sinned, I have been rebellious, I have acted perversly, I have done this and that evil, of which I now heartily repent, let <hi>this</hi> be my <hi>Expiation,</hi> and let those evils which might justly fall upon <hi>my</hi> head fall upon the head of my <hi>Sacrifice, Outram de sacrif. p.</hi> 273. And so also for the Gentiles, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius Demonst. l.</hi> 1. tells us, that they looked upon their <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58668:82"/>
God by way of <hi>Intercession</hi> for the People. For when the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was <hi>slain,</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi> was to take the <hi>bloud,</hi> and <hi>sprinkle</hi> some of it round about the Altar of <hi>burnt Offerings</hi>; and the rest of it, say the Jews, was <hi>poured out</hi> by the Priest on the Southside Floor of the Altar, where there were two holes through which it ran into a Channel that conveyed it into the Valley of <hi>Kidron</hi>; but in the <hi>Sin-Offerings</hi> for the <hi>High Priest</hi> and the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> he was to carry the bloud <hi>within</hi> the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and to <hi>sprinkle</hi> of it seven times before the Vail of the Sanctuary, and to put some of it upon the Horns of the Altar of <hi>Incense,</hi> after which the Remainder of the bloud was to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of, as was said before, on the Altar of Burnt Offerings. And at the <hi>great</hi> day of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation,</hi> the <hi>High Priest</hi> himself, having <hi>slain</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> was to carry the <hi>bloud</hi> of it into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and there with his finger to <hi>sprinkle</hi> the bloud of it seven times before the <hi>Mercy-Seat.</hi> Now this <hi>sprinkling</hi> of the <hi>bloud</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a solemn <hi>presenting</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> of the <hi>sacrificed</hi> Animal to God, as an <hi>exchange</hi> or <hi>price</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> for the <hi>forfeited</hi> life of the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender.</hi> For whatsoever was <hi>offered</hi> upon the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> was always looked upon as <hi>religiously</hi> presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God; so that by sprinkling the <hi>bloud</hi> on the Altar, which is the <hi>Vehicle</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is sometimes called the <hi>Life, vide</hi> Gen. 9.4. the <hi>Life</hi> was solemnly <hi>tendered</hi> and <hi>presented</hi> to God as to the <hi>supreme Lord</hi> of life and death; and the meaning of this <hi>tendry,</hi> was to <hi>move</hi> God by way of <hi>Intercession</hi> to accept of <hi>that</hi> life instead of the <hi>Offenders,</hi> which was <hi>forfeited</hi> into his hands.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58668:83"/>
For since, as a Learned Author of our own hath observed, all Divine Worship, whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>instituted,</hi> was either to <hi>implore</hi> or to <hi>comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate</hi> God's <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> this solemn <hi>sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of the <hi>bloud</hi> in <hi>expiatory</hi> Sacrifices must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily respect the <hi>imploring</hi> of God's <hi>Pardon</hi> of those sins for which the <hi>Expiation</hi> was designed. So that in performing this <hi>Rite</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi> was a silent <hi>Intercessor</hi> with God in the behalf of the People, and his <hi>action</hi> was a solemn <hi>Deprecation,</hi> of which <hi>this</hi> was the natural <hi>language</hi> and <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; O Lord I beseech thee be merciful to these <hi>guilty</hi> Supplicants, in lieu of whose <hi>bloud,</hi> which I acknowledge is justly <hi>forfeited</hi> to thee, I here present thee the <hi>life</hi> of this <hi>sacrificed Animal,</hi> whose <hi>bloud</hi> I am <hi>sprinkling</hi> on thy Altar, humbly imploring thee to accept it as a <hi>ransom</hi> for their lives, and in <hi>consideration</hi> of it to <hi>release</hi> them from that <hi>mortal</hi> penalty in which they stand <hi>bound</hi> to thy <hi>Iustice.</hi> Upon which <hi>Intercession</hi> of his, God's high displeasure was <hi>atoned,</hi> and the <hi>Priest</hi> thereupon Authorized to <hi>bless the People, i. e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to declare that God was <hi>appeased</hi> and <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>And thus you see what the Office of Priesthood <hi>is,</hi> and in what <hi>acts</hi> it <hi>consists</hi>; in sum therefore it consists in <hi>sacrificing</hi> to God for the <hi>sins</hi> of the People, and <hi>interceding</hi> with him in the <hi>vertue</hi> of the Sacrifice to be <hi>propitious</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>I proceed now in the second place to shew that <hi>both</hi> these Acts of the <hi>Priestly</hi> Office among the <hi>Iews,</hi> were <hi>designed</hi> and <hi>intended</hi> by God for <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:58668:83"/>
For as for the <hi>first,</hi> viz. <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> the Scripture plainly tells us that it was instituted for a <hi>Typical</hi> representation of the <hi>death</hi> of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> For so the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> makes the <hi>Sacrificed body</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> to <hi>answer</hi> to, and <hi>succeed</hi> in the room of the whole body of the <hi>Iewish Sacrifices,</hi> as the true <hi>Antitype</hi> of those <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows, Heb.</hi> 10.5, 6, &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the World,</hi> speaking of Christ, <hi>he saith, Sacrifice and Offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me,</hi> that is, a body to be sacrificed in the room of that former Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Offering; <hi>In burnt Offerings and Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thou hast had no pleasure; Then said he,</hi> verse 9. <hi>Lo I come to do thy will O God</hi>; that is, to die a Sacrifice for the sins of the world; and hereby, saith he, <hi>he taketh away the first,</hi> that is, those Typical Sacrifices, <hi>that he may establish the second,</hi> that is, that great Sacrifice of Christ's body; for so it follows, verse 10. <hi>By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Iesus Christ once for all,</hi> in which words he plainly makes <hi>all</hi> the Jewish Sacrifices <hi>in general</hi> to be <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of the <hi>great Sacrifice</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's <hi>Death.</hi> And indeed as those Sacrifices were all of them to be <hi>slain,</hi> and to be all <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>immaculate,</hi> they were so far forth at least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <hi>Types</hi> of our Saviour, both as to his <hi>death,</hi> and unspotted <hi>innocence</hi> and <hi>purity.</hi> But then as for <hi>those</hi> Sacrifices whose <hi>bodies</hi> were burnt <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> the Camp, <hi>they</hi> were more <hi>peculiarly</hi> Types than any of the rest, of our <hi>Saviour's Sacrifice,</hi> because they had not only <hi>all</hi> those things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to them by which the <hi>other</hi> Sacrifices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented

it, but besides <hi>that</hi> they were <hi>Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> for <hi>sin,</hi> as well as the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and by their being burnt <hi>without</hi> the <hi>Camp</hi> did more <hi>eminently</hi> prefigure our Saviour's being Crucified <hi>without</hi> the <hi>City.</hi> Hence the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10, 11, 12. <hi>We have an Altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle; for the Bodies of those Beasts whose bloud is brought into the Sanctuary by the High Priest for sin are burnt without the Camp,</hi> lest they should <hi>pollute</hi> the Congregation, as being <hi>defiled</hi> and <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> upon the account of the Peoples <hi>guilts</hi> which were <hi>transferred</hi> upon them; <hi>Wherefore Iesus also that he might sanctifie the People with his own bloud suffered without the Gate,</hi> that is, as an <hi>Expiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrifice,</hi> that took upon him the <hi>guilts</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and thereby became <hi>polluted</hi> and <hi>accursed</hi>; in which words the <hi>death</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represented as the true <hi>Antitype</hi> of the <hi>Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> Sacrifices of the <hi>Iews</hi>; and accordingly, as all <hi>Types</hi> have much <hi>less</hi> in them of that which they <hi>prefigure</hi> than their <hi>Antitypes,</hi> so those <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory</hi> Sacrifices had <hi>something</hi> of <hi>real</hi> Expiation in them, though much <hi>less</hi> than the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> For so <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>For if the bloud of Bulls and of Goats and the ashes of an Heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifie to the purifying of the flesh,</hi> (by which it is evident that there was a <hi>real</hi> Expiation made by <hi>those</hi> Sacrifices, so far as concerned <hi>the purifying mens flesh, i. e.</hi> relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them from <hi>corporal</hi> punishments and <hi>legal</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesses;) <hi>How much more,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall the bloud of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himself without spot to God, purge your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences

from dead works</hi>; where the <hi>same</hi> expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>kind,</hi> that was made by those <hi>Legal</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, is expresly attributed, though in a much higher <hi>degree,</hi> to the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi>; which plainly argues the <hi>former</hi> to be a <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Shadow</hi> of the <hi>later.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then as for the <hi>second</hi> Act of the Jewish Priesthood, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>presenting</hi> the <hi>bloud</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God by way of <hi>Intercession</hi> for the <hi>People,</hi> this was also instituted for a <hi>Typical</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s presenting the bloud of <hi>his</hi> sacrificed body to God by way of <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> for <hi>Mankind.</hi> And hence his bloud is called <hi>the bloud of sprinkling, which speaks better things for us than the bloud of Abel,</hi> Heb. 12.24. which is a plain allusion to the High Priest's <hi>sprinkling</hi> the <hi>bloud</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> before the <hi>Mercy-Seat</hi> on the <hi>great</hi> day of Expiation, by which action, as I shewed before, he <hi>interceded</hi> with God to be <hi>propitious</hi> to the People in <hi>consideration</hi> of that <hi>bloud</hi> which he there <hi>presented</hi> in <hi>their</hi> behalf.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58668:85"/>
the Jewish High Priest did, <hi>but by his own bloud, Heb.</hi> 9.12. where the High Priest's entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy of Holies <hi>with the bloud of Bulls and Goats</hi> is plainly opposed, as a Type to its Anti-type, to Christ's entering into Heaven <hi>with his own bloud,</hi> and therefore the High Priest's interceding for the <hi>People</hi> in the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> in vertue of the bloud of <hi>their</hi> Sacrifices must necessarily be Typical of Christ's interceding for <hi>us</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> in the vertue of <hi>his.</hi> Thus as God <hi>cast</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived</hi> the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Jewish <hi>Law</hi> in general into a <hi>prefiguration</hi> or visible <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> of the Mysteries of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that so by those <hi>Emblematical</hi> Predictions he might <hi>intimate</hi> before-hand those <hi>glorious</hi> truths to <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive</hi> minds, which he intended afterwards more <hi>plainly</hi> to <hi>reveal, (vid.

the Jews were in some measure instructed in the nature of the Priesthood of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and lastly, I shall now proceed to explain the <hi>Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Priestly</hi> Acts of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>corresponding</hi> to that <hi>ancient</hi> Priesthood in which they were <hi>prefigured.</hi> In General there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Priesthood of our Saviour corresponding to that ancient Priesthood consists in <hi>offering up</hi> himself a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for our <hi>sins,</hi> and in <hi>presenting</hi> that Sacrifice to God in <hi>our</hi> behalf, and thereby <hi>interceding</hi> with him to be <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>propitious</hi> to us. So that the Priesthood of our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in these <hi>two</hi> acts:</p>
               <p>First, In <hi>offering up</hi> himself a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for our <hi>sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In <hi>presenting</hi> that Sacrifice to God by way of <hi>Intercession</hi> for us; of each of which I shall discourse at large.</p>

            <div n="4" type="section">
               <head>SECT. IV. Concerning the Sacrifice of our Saviour.</head>
               <p>IN handling the first of these, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our Saviour, I shall endeavour, first, to shew that the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> had in it all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite conditions of a most <hi>real</hi> and <hi>compleat Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> for <hi>sin.</hi> Secondly, To make appear how <hi>effectually</hi> God's exacting <hi>such</hi> a Sacrifice in order to his being <hi>reconciled</hi> to <hi>sinners</hi> conduces to their <hi>reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:58668:86"/>First, That the death of Christ had in it all the requisite conditions of a <hi>real</hi> and most <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Sacrifice</hi> for <hi>sin.</hi> Now to make both a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>perfect expiatory</hi> Sacrifice, there are five things indispensibly necessary:</p>
               <p>First, That in being <hi>sacrificed</hi> it should be <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted</hi> in the <hi>room</hi> of an <hi>Offender</hi> to be punished <hi>for</hi> him in order to <hi>his</hi> being <hi>released</hi> from his own <hi>Personal</hi> obligation to punishment. For in all those <hi>Legal</hi> expiations which <hi>prefigured</hi> this <hi>great</hi> Expiation of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> the <hi>killing</hi> of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> was, as I shewed before, a <hi>real</hi> transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and inflicting upon <hi>it</hi> the punishment <hi>due</hi> to the <hi>Offender</hi> that offered it, in order to <hi>his</hi> being <hi>excused</hi> from suffering it in his own <hi>person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Another necessary condition of an Expiatory Sacrifice is that it should be <hi>pure, sound,</hi> and <hi>unblemished</hi>; and indeed <hi>this</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is required in <hi>all</hi> kinds of Sacrifices, whether <hi>Expiatory,</hi> or <hi>Eucharistical,</hi> that they should be <hi>pure</hi> or Legally <hi>clean,</hi> and that they should be <hi>sound</hi> and without <hi>blemish.</hi> For so <hi>Lev.</hi> 22.20. <hi>But whatsoever hath a blemish that shall ye not offer, for it shall not be acceptable for you</hi>; and ver. 21. <hi>It shall be perfect, i. e.</hi> sound and entire, <hi>to be accepted: there shall be no blemish therein</hi>; and then he goes on to particulars, it shall not be <hi>blind, or broken, or having a W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, or scurvy, or scabbed,</hi> verse 22. Now though the <hi>legal</hi> uncleanness and the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> blemishes here forbidden in <hi>Sacrifices</hi> had nothing of <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>immorality</hi> in them, yet the <hi>prohibition</hi> of these <hi>natural</hi> blemishes in Sacrifices that were incapable of <hi>moral</hi> ones, denotes the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58668:86"/>
necessity of a <hi>moral</hi> cleanness and unblemished<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in that <hi>great Expiatory</hi> Sacrifice for the sins of the World which they <hi>Typified</hi> and <hi>prefigured</hi>; and hence Christ is called, <hi>A Lamb without blemish and without spot,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another necessary condition to a perfect Expiatory Sacrifice is, that it should be of such an intrinsick <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>value</hi> as that its <hi>death</hi> may be, in some measure, an <hi>equivalent</hi> Commutation for the <hi>punishment</hi> which the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender</hi> deserves. For the end of <hi>punishing,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the <hi>Offender</hi> himself, or <hi>another</hi> in his stead, is to <hi>secure</hi> and <hi>maintain</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi>; in order whereunto it is highly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site that the <hi>punishment</hi> should <hi>ordinarily</hi> be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the <hi>demerit</hi> of the <hi>Crime</hi>; otherwise it will not be a sufficient motive to <hi>warn</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> men from committing it. And herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the <hi>imperfection</hi> of the <hi>ancient</hi> expiatory Sacrifices, that what <hi>they</hi> suffered was much <hi>short</hi> of what the <hi>Offenders</hi> they suffered for <hi>deserved</hi>; for they only substituted the life of a <hi>Brute</hi> in the room of the life of a <hi>Man,</hi> which is of far <hi>greater</hi> worth and value; and therefore by how much <hi>less</hi> valuable the life of a <hi>Beast</hi> is than the life of a <hi>Man,</hi> by so much <hi>less</hi> was the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>transferred</hi> upon the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> than the guilt <hi>contracted</hi> by the <hi>Offender.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another necessary condition to the making of a true and perfect Sacrifice was that it should be <hi>free</hi> and <hi>unforced</hi> on the part of the <hi>Offerer.</hi> For since he had <hi>deserved</hi> the punishment in his <hi>own</hi> Person, it was very fit, both that the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> that was to undergo it <hi>for</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:58668:87"/>
him should be something that was his <hi>own,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he could have no <hi>right</hi> to <hi>substitute</hi> it in his <hi>own stead,</hi> or to <hi>offer</hi> its <hi>life</hi> to God in <hi>exchange</hi> for his <hi>own</hi>; and that he should <hi>freely</hi> offer it to be <hi>killed</hi> in his stead, otherwise he had not been <hi>consenting</hi> to the exchange, without which it must have been <hi>invalid,</hi> and consequently the Expiation <hi>void</hi>; and hence <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.3. it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that <hi>he should offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is also a necessary condition to a true and perfect Sacrifice for sin that it should be <hi>admitted</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi> by God in the <hi>room</hi> and <hi>stead</hi> of the <hi>punishment</hi> that is due to him from the Offender <hi>himself.</hi> For by <hi>violating</hi> his <hi>Laws</hi> we give God a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>exact</hi> the <hi>Penalty</hi> of them at our <hi>own</hi> hands; so that if he pleases he may refuse to admit of any <hi>Substitute</hi> to suffer <hi>for</hi> us, and if he will insist upon his right to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish us in our <hi>own</hi> persons, and refuse to admit of any <hi>exchange</hi>; what <hi>another</hi> suffers for us will signifie nothing to our <hi>discharge</hi> or <hi>acquittal,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not our <hi>own</hi> suffering who stand <hi>perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> obliged to God to suffer the utmost evil that our sin deserves; and therefore to admit <hi>another</hi> to suffer for us is an Act of pure <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> in him, which he may <hi>grant</hi> or <hi>refuse</hi> as he pleases. So that the <hi>Expiatory</hi> vertue of <hi>all</hi> Sacrifice lies in God's <hi>admitting</hi> and <hi>accepting</hi> it in exchange for that <hi>personal</hi> punishment we owe him; and hence he is said to have <hi>given them the bloud upon the Altar to make an atonement for their Souls,</hi> Lev. 17.11. that is, to have <hi>admitted</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi> that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58668:87"/>
Bloud which was offered on the Altar as an <hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for their lives which were <hi>forfeited</hi> to him. And thus you see what are the <hi>necessary</hi> conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a <hi>real,</hi> and <hi>perfect, Expiatory</hi> Sacrifice; all which, as I shall now shew you, do fully <hi>concenter</hi> in the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> As</p>
               <p n="1">I. In <hi>dying</hi> or being <hi>sacrificed</hi> he was <hi>substituted</hi> in the <hi>room</hi> of sinful men to be <hi>punished</hi> for them in order to <hi>their</hi> being <hi>released</hi> from their <hi>personal</hi> obligation to punishment. And hence, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. he is said to have <hi>given himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works,</hi> that is, he gave <hi>his</hi> life in exchange for <hi>ours,</hi> and thereby became our <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For by what follows, it is plain that his giving himself <hi>for</hi> us here is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by way of an <hi>expiation,</hi> for it was, first, <hi>to redeem us from all iniquity,</hi> which is the very phrase by which the <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of <hi>Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory</hi> Sacrifices is expressed; for so <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which signifies to <hi>redeem</hi> in the Greek, is the same with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which signifies to <hi>expiate</hi> by <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in the Hebrew; and accordingly the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in the Greek signifies the price of <hi>redemption,</hi> is frequently used for the Hebrew Copher, which signifies a price to <hi>reconcile</hi> or <hi>propitiate.</hi> So that Christ's giving himself for us to <hi>redeem</hi> us from all iniquity, must signifie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common acceptation of the Phrase, his laying down his life <hi>for</hi> us as the price of <hi>our</hi> propitiation with <hi>God.</hi> For so among the Jews that common form of speech, <hi>Let me be your redemption,</hi> was as much as to say, let <hi>me</hi> bear <hi>your</hi> Iniquities, and undergo the punishment of them that <hi>you</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:58668:88"/>
may escape, <hi>Buxt. Lex. Chald.</hi> 10.78. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to which in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. Christ is said to <hi>die for the redemption of transgressions,</hi> that is, to <hi>buy off</hi> the <hi>punishment</hi> of them with his own <hi>bloud.</hi> For so he is said to have given himself <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> a <hi>ransom</hi> or <hi>price</hi> of <hi>Redemption for all,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, 6. and to have given his life as a <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies, to <hi>cleanse</hi> from <hi>guilt</hi> by <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Thus <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.30. <hi>On that day shall the Priest make Atonement for ye to purifie ye, that ye may be pure from all your sin before the Lord</hi>; and so the word is generally taken not only in the Writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> but also in all other Authors, by whom <hi>Expiatory</hi> Sacrifices are promiscuously called <gap reason="foreign">

For it was from <hi>that</hi> that the bloud of Sacrifices did <hi>immediately</hi> purifie men. And hence he is said to <hi>have died for our sins,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.3 to <hi>have given himself for our sins,</hi> Gal. 1.4. and to <hi>have once suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our sins, the just for the unjust,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.8. and his <hi>Bloud</hi> is said to <hi>be shed for many for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins,</hi> Matth. 26.28. and to be <hi>a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our sins,</hi> 1 John 4.10. by which expressions it is evident that our sins were the <hi>cause,</hi> and the expiation of them the <hi>end</hi> of Christ's suffering; and it is upon this account that he is said to <hi>bear our sins in his own body on the tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. that is,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58668:88"/>
to undergo the punishment of them in those exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site torments he endured upon the Cross, and to <hi>be made sin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. even as the <hi>Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory</hi> Sacrifices were made <hi>sin,</hi> i. e. <hi>Piacula,</hi> that underwent the <hi>punishment</hi> of sin for the <hi>Offenders</hi> that offered them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.3, 29. and also to <hi>be made a curse for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. that is, by having the <hi>guilts</hi> of our <hi>sins</hi> transferred on <hi>him,</hi> even as the Sacrifices were <hi>cursed,</hi> as was shewed before, by the very <hi>translation</hi> of the guilts of the people upon <hi>them</hi>; and accordingly, as by <hi>this</hi> Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>those</hi> Sacrifices were rendered <hi>cursed</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi> and as <hi>such,</hi> were to be burnt <hi>without</hi> the Camp, so our Saviour upon the same account <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without the Gate,</hi> Heb. 13.11, 12. And to name no more, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. we are told, <hi>That he should bear our griefs, and carry our sorrows, and be wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities; that the Chastisements of our peace were upon him, and that by his stripes we should be healed; that the Lord hath laid upon him the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of us all, and that for our transgressions he was stricken, that his Soul was made an Offering for sin; that he should bear our iniquities, and be numbred with the transgressors, and bear the sins of many, and make intercession for the transgressors</hi>; all which expressions do as <hi>plainly</hi> denote him to be <hi>substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted</hi> to be punished for <hi>us,</hi> in order to our <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease,</hi> as it is <hi>possible</hi> for words to do; and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we will admit <hi>that</hi> to be the sence of Scripture, which the words of it <hi>do</hi> as plainly import as they <hi>could</hi> have done if it <hi>had</hi> been its sence, it will be impossible to determine it to <hi>any</hi> sence whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; because men may <hi>prevaricate</hi> upon the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58668:89"/>
                  <hi>plainest</hi> words, and with quirks of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism</hi> pervert them to a <hi>contrary</hi> meaning. And I dare undertake by the <hi>same</hi> Arts that our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries use to avoid the force of <hi>these</hi> Testimonies, to <hi>elude</hi> the <hi>plainest</hi> words that the Wit of man can invent to express <hi>this</hi> Proposition, that <hi>Christ's Death was a punishment for our sins</hi>; which to any reasonable man is a sufficient answer to all the <hi>Socinian</hi> Cavils. And indeed the whole <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> of Scripture runs so <hi>clear</hi> against them, that they do as good as acknowledge, that according to the most <hi>common</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> acceptation of its words, it fairly implies the Doctrine we contend for, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Death of Christ was a real pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for the sins of the World; but their main Plea is, that it is <hi>unjust,</hi> in the nature of the thing, to punish <hi>one</hi> man for the sins of <hi>another,</hi> and therefore we ought rather to impose <hi>any</hi> sence on the words of Scripture, how <hi>forein</hi> soever, than attribute to God so great a piece of <hi>injustice,</hi> as the punishing his <hi>own Son</hi> for the <hi>sins</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> But as for the <hi>Iustice</hi> of this procedure, I shall endeavour by and by to <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>vindicate</hi> it.</p>

And therefore <hi>herein</hi> the Apostle places the <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of Christ's bloud, by which it was rendred sufficiently <hi>precious</hi> to be a ransom for the sins of the World, that it was <hi>of a Lamb without spot or blemish, i. e.</hi> the bloud of a most <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> person, who never deserved the least evil on his <hi>own</hi> account, and therefore was truly <hi>precious,</hi> and sit to be a ransom for the sins of <hi>others,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18, 19.

that was due from them to his Justice, was that he might <hi>preserve</hi> and <hi>maintain</hi> the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi> For had he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted the punishment from the sinners <hi>themselves,</hi> he must have <hi>destroyed</hi> the whole Race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and had he <hi>pardoned</hi> them, on the other hand, without <hi>any</hi> punishment at all, he must have exposed his <hi>authority</hi> to the <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>outrage</hi> of every <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>insolent</hi> Offender; and therefore to avoid these <hi>dangerous</hi> extremities of <hi>severity</hi> and <hi>impunity,</hi> his infinite wisdom found out <hi>this</hi> expedient, to admit of some <hi>exchange</hi> for our <hi>persons</hi> and <hi>punishment,</hi> that so some <hi>other</hi> thing or person being <hi>substituted</hi> in <hi>our</hi> stead, to suffer and be punished <hi>for</hi> us, neither <hi>we</hi> might be <hi>destroyed,</hi> nor our <hi>sins</hi> be <hi>unpunished.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being the <hi>reason</hi> of God's <hi>admitting</hi> of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> it was highly requisite that the <hi>punishment</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> should bear some <hi>proportion</hi> to the <hi>guilt</hi> of the <hi>Offenders</hi>; otherwise it will not <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> God's <hi>reason</hi> of <hi>admitting</hi> it. For since the reason of his admitting it was the <hi>security</hi> of his <hi>Authority,</hi> the <hi>less</hi> he had admitted, the <hi>less</hi> he must have secured his Authority by it. For to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted a <hi>small</hi> punishment for a <hi>great</hi> demerit, would have been within a <hi>few</hi> degrees as destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to his Authority as to have exacted <hi>none</hi> at all; to punish but <hi>little</hi> for <hi>great</hi> Crimes, is within <hi>one</hi> remove as mischievous to Government as <hi>total</hi> impunity; and therefore to support his own Authority over us, it was highly requisite that he should exact not only a <hi>punishment</hi> for our sin, but also a punishment <hi>proportionable</hi> to the <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>demerit</hi> of it. For there is no doubt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58668:90"/>
but the <hi>nearer</hi> the punishment is to the demerit of the sin, the <hi>greater</hi> security it must give to his Authority. And upon <hi>this</hi> account the Sacrifices of the <hi>Iews</hi> were infinitely <hi>short</hi> of making a <hi>full</hi> expiation for their sins; because being but <hi>brute Animals,</hi> their <hi>death</hi> was no way a <hi>proportionable</hi> punishment to the <hi>great</hi> demerit of the sins of the People. For what proportion could there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>momentany</hi> sufferings of a <hi>Beast,</hi> and those <hi>eternal</hi> sufferings which the sins of a <hi>man</hi> do deserve? The death of a <hi>Beast</hi> is a punishment <hi>very</hi> short of the death of a <hi>Man,</hi> but <hi>infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> short of that <hi>eternal</hi> death to which the man's <hi>guilts</hi> do <hi>oblige</hi> him; and accordingly the Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations which were made for <hi>Men</hi> by the death of those <hi>Beasts</hi> were very <hi>short</hi> and <hi>imperfect.</hi> For so the Apostle tells us, that they only <hi>sanctified to the purifying of the flesh, Heb.</hi> 9.13. that is, to the <hi>acquitting</hi> them from their <hi>Corporal</hi> Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and <hi>legal Vncleannesses</hi>; but could not at all <hi>make them perfect as pertaining to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, i. e.</hi> could not <hi>expiate</hi> the <hi>guilt</hi> of any <hi>wilful</hi> sin, by which their <hi>Consciences</hi> were laid <hi>waste</hi> and <hi>wounded,</hi> ver. 9. And accordingly the <hi>Heathen</hi> seem to be aware how <hi>short</hi> the death of <hi>Beasts</hi> was of the <hi>punishment</hi> which was due for the sins of <hi>Men.</hi> For though in ordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <hi>they</hi> sacrificed <hi>Beasts,</hi> as well as the <hi>Iews,</hi> yet in <hi>great</hi> extremities, when they conceived their Gods to be <hi>highly</hi> displeased with them, even the most <hi>civilized</hi> of them sacrificed <hi>Men</hi>; which shews, that they thought the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Beasts</hi> to be an <hi>insufficient</hi> expiation for the <hi>sins</hi> of <hi>men.</hi> And indeed it cannot be denied but that the Sacrifice
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58668:91"/>
of a <hi>Man,</hi> as <hi>such,</hi> is much more <hi>proportionable</hi> to the punishment which the sins of men deserve, than the Sacrifice of a <hi>Beast</hi>; because a Man is a much <hi>nobler</hi> Creature, as being far advanced <hi>above</hi> a Beast by the Prerogative of his <hi>Reason</hi>; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently <hi>his</hi> death, considered as a <hi>Man,</hi> must be a much more <hi>valuable</hi> exchange for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is due to those he dies for. But <hi>herein</hi> the Heathen were miserably <hi>mistaken,</hi> that they did not consider that the <hi>men</hi> whom <hi>they</hi> sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, were <hi>sinners</hi> as well as <hi>themselves,</hi> and that it is a much <hi>greater</hi> flaw in an <hi>Expiatory</hi> Sacrifice to be a <hi>Sinner</hi> than to be a <hi>Brute.</hi> For whereas the <hi>latter</hi> only renders it less <hi>effectual</hi> and <hi>valuable</hi>; the <hi>former,</hi> as was shewn before, renders it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>void</hi> and <hi>insignificant</hi>; and therefore though the death of a <hi>Man,</hi> considered as such, is of much more <hi>value</hi> than the death of a <hi>Beast,</hi> yet to <hi>expiate</hi> for the sins of men, there is more inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> in the death of an <hi>innocent</hi> Beast, than of a <hi>sinful</hi> Man; because the <hi>latter</hi> can expiate only for his <hi>own</hi> sin, whereas the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> can have <hi>no</hi> sin but that of <hi>others</hi> to expiate. Since therefore men were all <hi>spotted</hi> and <hi>blemished</hi> with Sin, there was <hi>no</hi> life so fit for them to <hi>offer</hi> to God, in <hi>commutation</hi> for their <hi>forfeited</hi> lives, as that of <hi>innocent Brutes</hi>; so that the <hi>best</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation they could make was infinitely <hi>short</hi> of their demerit. And suppose that the <hi>men</hi> which the Heathen offered had been all <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> yet their <hi>lives</hi> would have been only an <hi>equivalent</hi> commutation for the <hi>forfeited</hi> lives of an <hi>equal</hi> number of sinners; unless therefore <hi>one</hi> half of Mankind had been <hi>innocent,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> had been sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58668:91"/>
for the <hi>other</hi> half that was <hi>guilty,</hi> it had not been an <hi>equal</hi> Commutation so much as for the <hi>temporal</hi> punishment which was due to God from the <hi>guilty</hi>; but then for their <hi>eternal</hi> punishment a <hi>Hecatomb</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> had been <hi>short</hi> and <hi>insufficient.</hi> For what <hi>proportion</hi> is there between a <hi>temporary</hi> death and an <hi>eternal</hi> misery? Since therefore, in great compassion to us, God hath thought meet to accept of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in lieu of that <hi>punishment</hi> which was due to him from <hi>Mankind,</hi> and since to <hi>secure</hi> his own <hi>Authority,</hi> it was highly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site that what <hi>this</hi> Sacrifice suffered for us, should be in some measure <hi>equivalent</hi> to what we had <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,</hi> and since we had deserved to suffer <hi>for ever,</hi> it necessarily follows that this Sacrifice must be something <hi>infinitely</hi> more <hi>precious</hi> and <hi>valuable</hi> than the bloud of <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Goats,</hi> yea, than the lives of <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi>; and what can that be but the <hi>bloud</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Son of God,</hi> the infinite <hi>dignity</hi> of whose <hi>Person</hi> rendered his <hi>sufferings</hi> for us <hi>equivalent</hi> to the infinite <hi>demerit</hi> of our <hi>sins.</hi> For it was the dignity of his Person that gave the <hi>value</hi> to his sufferings, and <hi>inhanced</hi> his <hi>temporary Death</hi> to a full equivalence to those <hi>endless miseries</hi> which we had deserved. For if the life of a King be (as <hi>David</hi>'s People told him) <hi>worth ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand lives,</hi> of what an <hi>infinite</hi> value must the life of <hi>the Lord of glory</hi> and of the <hi>Prince of life</hi> be, who being the <hi>Son of God,</hi> of the same <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Essence</hi> with his <hi>eternal Father,</hi> must from <hi>thence</hi> necessarily <hi>derive</hi> upon his Sacrifice an <hi>immensity</hi> of <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>efficacy.</hi> And hence we are said to be <hi>purchased</hi> with the <hi>bloud of God,</hi> Acts 20.28. and to have the <hi>life of God laid down</hi> for us, <hi>Iohn</hi>

3.16. and to be <hi>redeemed</hi> not <hi>with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, but with the precious bloud of Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. and accordingly the Author to the Hebrews makes the <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of Christ's bloud to consist in the <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>value</hi> of it; <hi>For if the bloud of Bulls and Goats,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>sanctified to the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the bloud of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your consciences from dead works to serve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9.13, 14. By all which it is evident that it was the infinite <hi>dignity</hi> of Christ's <hi>Person</hi> which derived that infinite <hi>merit</hi> on his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> whereby it became an <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi> to the infinite <hi>demerit</hi> of our <hi>sins.</hi> Nay, of <hi>such</hi> an infinite value and worth was his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, that it not only <hi>countervailed</hi> for the punishment due for our sin, but did abundantly <hi>preponderate</hi> it; upon which account God inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himself, not only to <hi>remit</hi> that <hi>Punishment,</hi> in consideration of it, but also to <hi>bestow</hi> his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and <hi>eternal life</hi> on us; <hi>both</hi> which, as hath been shewn before, are as well the <hi>purchace</hi> of Christ's <hi>bloud,</hi> as the remission of our sins. For God might have <hi>remitted</hi> our <hi>punishment</hi> without <hi>superadding</hi> the gift of his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>eternal life</hi> to it; and therefore since, in consideration of Christ's bloud, he hath superadded <hi>these</hi> Gifts to the remission of our punishment, it is evident that his bloud was <hi>equivalent</hi> to <hi>both, i. e.</hi> that it was not only a <hi>valuable</hi> consideration for the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> of our <hi>sins,</hi> but also for the <hi>assistance</hi> of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and our <hi>eternal happiness.</hi>

                  <hi>unforced.</hi> For since as a Sacrifice he was to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,</hi> and yet to undergo the <hi>punishment</hi> of our sin, he could not <hi>be</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>do</hi> the <hi>other</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his own free <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>approbation.</hi> For no <hi>innocent</hi> person can be justly made obnoxious to <hi>punishment</hi> but by his own <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Choice</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>punishment</hi> bears a necessary respect to <hi>sin,</hi> and the desert of <hi>suffering</hi> evil doth originally spring out of <hi>doing</hi> evil.

For though he hath no sin of his <hi>own</hi> to be punished for, yet he may by his own act <hi>oblige</hi> himself to undergo the punishment of <hi>another</hi> man's. And therefore though <hi>merely</hi> as an <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> person he cannot <hi>deserve</hi> to be punished, either upon his <hi>own</hi> account, or any <hi>other</hi> man's, because having no sin of his <hi>own</hi> he cannot be guilty of <hi>another</hi> man's; yet so far as he hath the <hi>free</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of <hi>himself,</hi> he may <hi>substitute</hi> himself in the <hi>room</hi> of one that is <hi>guilty,</hi> and thereby render himself <hi>obnoxious</hi> to <hi>his</hi> punishment.

tells, that <hi>all have sinned,</hi> and that <hi>the wages of sin is death.</hi> Christ's life therefore being in his <hi>own</hi> free disposal, he had an undoubted right to exchange it with God for the lives of our Souls, and the lives of our souls being in <hi>God</hi>'s free dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, he had as undoubted a right to exchange them with Christ's for his life upon the free <hi>Tendry</hi> which he made of it. And in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change <hi>neither</hi> Party could be <hi>injured,</hi> because they both received an <hi>equivalent</hi> for what they gave; <hi>Christ</hi> gave his own life to God, for which God gave him the lives of our Souls in exchange, which were far <hi>dearer</hi> to him; <hi>God</hi> gave the lives of our Souls to Christ, for which Christ gave him his own most precious life in exchange, which, considering the infinite <hi>dignity</hi> of his <hi>Person,</hi> was at the least <hi>tant-amount.</hi> It is true indeed, <hi>both</hi> Parties having a <hi>right</hi> to the free <hi>disposal</hi> of the goods which they exchange with each other, to render the exchange <hi>just</hi> and <hi>valid</hi> it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that <hi>both</hi> should be freely <hi>consenting</hi> to it; now that <hi>God</hi> was freely consenting I shall shew by and by; and that <hi>Christ</hi> was so too the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture expresly testifies; for so we are told, that <hi>he gave himself for our sins,</hi> Gal. 1.4. and that <hi>he gave his life a ransom for many,</hi> and <hi>gave his flesh for the life of the World,</hi> Matt. 21.28. and in a word, that <hi>he gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity,</hi> Tit. 2.14. and that <hi>he laid down his life for us,</hi> 1 John 3.16. all which plainly imply, that by his own <hi>voluntary consent</hi> he substituted himself to suffer in <hi>our</hi> stead that <hi>we</hi> might escape, and freely exchanged his <hi>own</hi> life with God for the lives of <hi>our</hi> Souls which were

And therefore notwithstanding that Christ hath <hi>suffered</hi> for us, and God hath <hi>admitted</hi> his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ours, yet this being out of meer <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> to us, he is still truly said to pardon and <hi>forgive us for Christ's sake,</hi> Eph. 4.32. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause for the sake of <hi>Christ</hi>'s suffering he graciously remits to <hi>us</hi> the Obligation of his Law which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the punishment of our sin at our <hi>own</hi> hands; and since his remitting to us the Obligation of his Law for the sake of Christ's suffering was pure <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> he was not at all obliged to remit it <hi>unconditionally,</hi> but being absolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of his own graces and favours he might remit it upon what <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> he pleased. So that though if we had suffered in our <hi>own</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons the <hi>utmost</hi> of what our sin doth <hi>deserve,</hi> he had been obliged in <hi>justice</hi> to discharge us <hi>without</hi> any farther <hi>condition,</hi> yet since out of his own <hi>free grace</hi> he hath admitted <hi>another</hi> to suffer for us, he may admit it with what <hi>limitations</hi> he pleases,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58668:95"/>
and if he shall think meet (as he <hi>hath</hi> done) to limit it to our <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>amendment,</hi> all that Christ hath suffered for us will be <hi>insignificant</hi> to our discharge from our obligation to punishment unless we <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend.</hi> So that the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> you see, doth not expiate mens sins as their <hi>personal</hi> punishments do, by their <hi>own</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural vertue, but by vertue of God's <hi>accepting</hi> it upon his own <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>conditions.</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God's <hi>accepting</hi> it, it would not have been at all an expiation for the <hi>sins of the World,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>conditions</hi> upon <hi>which</hi> he accepteth it, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>amendment,</hi> it will not be at all an Expiation for <hi>ours.</hi> Now God hath so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declared his <hi>acceptance</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Death as an <hi>Expiation</hi> for our sins; for it was God that <hi>laid upon him the iniquities of us all,</hi> Isa. 53.6. that <hi>gave his only begotten Son,</hi> John 3.16. and <hi>sent him to be a propitiation for us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.10. which plainly imply his free acceptance of him; And therefore Christ is said to have <hi>given himself for us an Offering and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour,</hi> Eph. 5.2. <hi>i. e.</hi> for an Expiation that was highly <hi>grateful</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> to him. So that <hi>now</hi> the expiation of our sins by the bloud of Christ wholly depends on <hi>our</hi> performing the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> on which God hath accepted it, and since it is upon condition that we <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend,</hi> that God hath accepted the bloud of Christ in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for the eternal punishment we owe him, unless we perform <hi>this</hi> condition, the Bloud of Christ will not at all <hi>avail</hi> us, but we shall still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as much <hi>obliged</hi> to undergo that punishment, as if he had <hi>never</hi> died for us <hi>at all.</hi> God's <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:58668:95"/>
indeed hath made the Death of Christ <hi>available</hi> for us under those <hi>conditions</hi> and <hi>limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> upon <hi>which</hi> he accepted it, but if when he hath accepted it <hi>conditionally,</hi> we expect that it should avail us <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>unconditionally,</hi> we miserably <hi>deceive</hi> and <hi>abuse</hi> our own souls. Thus far therefore God's <hi>acceptance</hi> of Christ's Death <hi>instead</hi> of the punishment we have deserved hath rendred it an effectual <hi>expiation</hi> and <hi>ransom</hi> for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that if they <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend</hi> they shall be <hi>released</hi> and <hi>acquitted</hi> from the obligation they lie under to suffer eternal <hi>punishment</hi> in their <hi>own</hi> persons, and <hi>entitled</hi> to everlasting <hi>life</hi> and <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</hi> And thus the Death of Christ, you see, had in it all the necessary qualifications of a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>compleat</hi> propitiatory Sacrifice; I proceed therefore in the second place to shew what a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> method this of God's admitting Christ's Sacrifice for sinners is to <hi>reduce</hi> and <hi>reform</hi> Mankind, which will evidently appear by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these five things:</p>
               <p>First, That the Sacrifice of Christ's Death was a most <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>affecting</hi> acknowledgment of the infinite <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>demerit</hi> of our sin. For thus under the Law the offering of <hi>Propitiatory</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices implied a most <hi>solemn</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the <hi>guilt</hi> of the <hi>Offerer.</hi> For his laying his <hi>hand</hi> upon the <hi>head</hi> of his Sacrifice, was a <hi>Symbolical</hi> action by which he solemnly <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged</hi> to God that he had justly <hi>deserved</hi> to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that death <hi>himself</hi> which his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was suffering for him; and accordingly the Jews have this Maxim, <hi>Vbi non est peccatorum confessio, ibi non est impositio manuum, quia manuum impositio
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58668:96"/>
ad confessionem pertinet</hi>; where there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of sins there is no imposition of hands, because the imposition of hands appertains to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. For so <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.5. they are particularly directed to <hi>confess</hi> their sins upon their <hi>bringing their Trespass-Offering before the Lord,</hi> and, as hath been shewn before, they had a set <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Confession</hi> in all their <hi>expiatory</hi> Sacrifices, and particularly in that <hi>solemn</hi> Propitiation, <hi>viz.</hi> the dismission of the <hi>Scape-Goat,</hi> the High Priest is directed to lay both his hands upon the Goat's Head, and <hi>to confess over him all the iniquities of the Children of Israel,</hi> Lev. 16.21. so that as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> is a kind of <hi>audible</hi> Sacrifice, so <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was a kind of <hi>visible</hi> Confession; and the demerit of their sin being thus represented to their <hi>Eyes</hi> by the death of their Sacrifice, was far more apt to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>affect</hi> them with <hi>horror</hi> and <hi>detestation</hi> of it, than any <hi>audible</hi> Confession how <hi>severe</hi> or <hi>pungent</hi> soever. And accordingly our Saviour in <hi>offering</hi> up himself as an expiation for our sin, did as it were, lay his hand upon his <hi>own</hi> head, and, as <hi>our</hi> Representative, solemnly <hi>acknowledge</hi> to God that <hi>we</hi> had justly <hi>deserved</hi> to suffer for our sin a punishment <hi>equivalent</hi> to that which <hi>he</hi> was undergoing for us. And what a <hi>dreadful</hi> one must that be which is <hi>equivalent</hi> to the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Son of God?</hi> What less punishment than our <hi>everlasting</hi> misery can <hi>countervail</hi> the <hi>temporary</hi> death of him who was so <hi>eminent</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> who was <hi>God-man</hi> united in <hi>one</hi> person, and the <hi>Lamb of God</hi> without <hi>spot</hi> or <hi>blemish?</hi> If the <hi>Iews</hi> by sacrificing a <hi>Beast</hi> did make such a <hi>moving</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, that they <hi>themselves</hi> deserved to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58668:96"/>
die, how much more did Christ by sacrificing <hi>himself</hi> for us, acknowledge in our stead that we deserved to die <hi>eternally?</hi> So that whatsoever <hi>vertue</hi> there is in the most <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>pathetick</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to create in mens minds a <hi>horrour</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi> of their sins, all <hi>that</hi> and much <hi>more</hi> there is in the Sacrifice of our Saviour, whose Bloud cried <hi>louder</hi> against our sins, and made a far more <hi>Tragical</hi> confession of their demerit than it's possible for the most <hi>sorrowful</hi> Penitent to do with all the <hi>Eloquence</hi> of his <hi>grief</hi> and bitter <hi>strains</hi> of <hi>self-abhorrence.</hi> And hence our Saviour is said to have <hi>condemned sin in the flesh,</hi> Rom. 8.3. <hi>i. e.</hi> to have solemnly <hi>acknowledged</hi> by his <hi>dying</hi> for it, what a <hi>dreadful</hi> punishment it <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is to be considered also, that the Sacrifice of Christ's Death was a most <hi>ample</hi> declaration of God's <hi>severity</hi> against our <hi>sins.</hi> All <hi>wise</hi> Governours ought so to exercise their <hi>Mercy,</hi> as that it may not be <hi>prejudicial</hi> to their <hi>Authority</hi> by giving Offenders <hi>encouragement</hi> to <hi>kick</hi> against it; but whilst their mercy is <hi>easie,</hi> and apt to be moved by <hi>slight</hi> Reasons and Motives, it will infallibly <hi>expose</hi> their <hi>Authority,</hi> and render it <hi>cheap</hi> and <hi>vile</hi> in the eyes of <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>insolent</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; the <hi>Reasons</hi> therefore which move a Prince to <hi>pardon</hi> Criminals ought to be such, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, as give all manner of <hi>discouragement</hi> to them from <hi>presuming</hi> upon <hi>impunity</hi> for the <hi>future.</hi> God therefore being <hi>inclined</hi> by the infinite <hi>benignity</hi> of his Nature to shew <hi>mercy</hi> to sinners, was obliged in <hi>wisdom</hi> to shew it in <hi>such</hi> a way, and upon <hi>such</hi> reasons as might sufficiently <hi>discourage</hi> them
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58668:97"/>
from <hi>presuming</hi> upon his <hi>Mercy</hi> to the <hi>prejudice</hi> of his <hi>Authority</hi>; and there is no reason could be so sufficient to this end, as a <hi>valuable</hi> Sacrifice to suffer in our <hi>stead,</hi> and <hi>bear</hi> the <hi>punishment</hi> of our sin; which reason carries with it such an <hi>awful</hi> severity, as must needs <hi>dishearten</hi> any <hi>considering</hi> sinner from presuming upon impunity if he <hi>go on</hi> in his sin. For next to exacting the punishment of the Offender <hi>himself,</hi> the most <hi>dreadful</hi> severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he could have expressed was not to remit it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any consideration but <hi>this,</hi> that some <hi>other</hi> should undergo it in his <hi>stead</hi>; and by how much <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>valuable</hi> the person is, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes it for us, so much <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable</hi> God's severity appears in remitting it to us. Since therefore in consideration of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, God would admit no <hi>meaner</hi> Sacrifice than the precious <hi>Bloud</hi> of his own <hi>Eternal Son,</hi> he hath hereby expressed the <hi>utmost</hi> indignation against our sin, that he could possibly do, unless he had absolutely resolved <hi>never</hi> to pardon it <hi>at all.</hi> So that <hi>now</hi> we have all the <hi>reason</hi> that Heaven or Earth can afford us, to <hi>tremble</hi> at his <hi>severity,</hi> even while we are within the <hi>Arms</hi> of his <hi>mercy.</hi> For what man in his Wits would take <hi>encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to <hi>sin on</hi> from a <hi>mercy</hi> that cost the <hi>Bloud</hi> of the <hi>Son of God?</hi> He that can presume upon <hi>such</hi> a reason of mercy hath <hi>courage</hi> enough to <hi>out-face</hi> the flames of <hi>Hell,</hi> and if Hell it self had stood <hi>open</hi> before us, and we had <hi>seen</hi> the damned Ghosts weltering in the flames of it, it would not have given us such a <hi>loud</hi> and <hi>horrible</hi> warning of God's <hi>severity</hi> against our sin as this <hi>tremendous</hi> Sacrifice of the Son of God doth. If then a <hi>mercy</hi> that is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58668:97"/>
so <hi>secured</hi> from being made an <hi>encouragement</hi> to sin by the <hi>terrible</hi> reason and consideration upon which it is <hi>founded</hi> cannot <hi>deter</hi> us from <hi>sinning on,</hi> there is no <hi>wise</hi> mercy that we are <hi>capable</hi> of, and consequently no mercy that the great God can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge with <hi>safety</hi> to his <hi>Authority.</hi> For what <hi>mercy</hi> can be <hi>safe</hi> from our <hi>abuse</hi> and <hi>presumption,</hi> if <hi>this</hi> be not that is thus <hi>guarded</hi> with <hi>thunder,</hi> and <hi>attended</hi> with the <hi>utmost</hi> severity that mercy could possibly admit of? Wherefore if after I have seen my Saviour in his Agony <hi>deprecating</hi> with <hi>fruitless</hi> cries that <hi>fearful</hi> Cup which I deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; if after I have beheld him <hi>hanging</hi> on the <hi>Cross,</hi> covered with <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Bloud,</hi> and in the bitter Agony of his Soul heard him crying out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> And, in a word, if after I have seen that God, to whom he was infinitely <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>precious,</hi> turn a <hi>deaf</hi> ear to his <hi>mournful</hi> cries, and utterly <hi>refuse</hi> to <hi>abate</hi> him so much as one <hi>degree</hi> or <hi>circumstance</hi> of a most <hi>shameful</hi> and <hi>tormenting</hi> death in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>my</hi> Pardon; If, I say, after such a <hi>horrible</hi> spectacle I have <hi>heart</hi> enough to <hi>sin on,</hi> I am a <hi>couragious</hi> sinner <hi>indeed,</hi> or rather a <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> one, not to be <hi>affected</hi> or <hi>restrained</hi> by all the <hi>terrors</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Sacrifice of Christ is also to be considered as a most <hi>obliging</hi> expression of the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Saviour</hi> to us. For if God had so pleased he might have exacted our punishment at our <hi>own</hi> hands, and made us smart <hi>for ever</hi> in our <hi>own</hi> Persons, and this notwithstanding we had heartily <hi>repented.</hi> For though to <hi>repent</hi> is the <hi>best</hi> thing a sinner <hi>can</hi> do, yet it doth not alter the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:58668:98"/>
of the <hi>sin</hi> he repenteth of, so as to render it <hi>less</hi> evil or <hi>less</hi> deserving of punishment; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is Repentance a <hi>sufficient</hi> reason to move the <hi>all-wise</hi> Governour of the World to grant a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Act of <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>indulgence</hi> to sinners; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconsistent with the safety of any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Humane,</hi> so far to <hi>encourage</hi> Offenders, as to <hi>indemnifie</hi> them by a publick <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> meerly upon <hi>condition</hi> of their future <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>amendment.</hi> For all men are naturally apt to presume that God will be <hi>better</hi> to them than his <hi>word,</hi> and therefore had he declared that he would pardon them upon their <hi>repentance</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>other</hi> reason, <hi>this</hi> would have encouraged them to hope that he might pardon them, though they repented not <hi>at all,</hi> or at least though they repented but by <hi>halves.</hi> Wherefore since our <hi>repentance</hi> is not a <hi>sufficient</hi> reason to oblige God to grant a publick <hi>Pardon</hi> to sinners, and since this was the <hi>best</hi> reason we could offer in our own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half to move him thereunto, it hence necessarily follows, that he might have <hi>justly</hi> exacted the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of our sin of <hi>us,</hi> and made us smart for it <hi>for ever,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>best</hi> reason we could have offered him to the <hi>contrary.</hi> But such was his <hi>goodness</hi> towards us, as to admit <hi>another</hi> to suffer in <hi>our</hi> stead, that so neither <hi>we</hi> might be <hi>ruined,</hi> nor our <hi>sins</hi> be <hi>unpunished.</hi> And then that the punishment of our sin might be a <hi>sufficient</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to his <hi>injured</hi> Authority, he <hi>admitted</hi> his <hi>own Son</hi> upon his <hi>voluntary</hi> offering himself to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo it for us, who by the <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>innocence</hi> of his <hi>Person</hi> rendered that <hi>temporary</hi> Death he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent for us <hi>equi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58668:98"/>
which we had deserved. Now what a <hi>Prodigy</hi> of <hi>love</hi> was this, that the God of Heaven whom we had so infinitely <hi>offended,</hi> should part with his <hi>own Son</hi> for us, and freely consent that <hi>he</hi> should undergo <hi>our</hi> punishment! Which while I seriously consider, it <hi>puzzles</hi> my <hi>conceit,</hi> and <hi>out-reaches</hi> my <hi>wonder</hi>; so that though I have infinite reason to <hi>rejoyce</hi> in it, yet while I am contemplating it, I seem to be looking down from some <hi>stupendious</hi> Precipice, whose <hi>height</hi> fills me with a <hi>sacred</hi> hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and almost <hi>oversets</hi> my <hi>Reason.</hi> But Oh! the <hi>amazing</hi> love of the <hi>Son of God</hi> towards us, that he should put <hi>himself</hi> in <hi>our</hi> stead, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his <hi>own</hi> Breast as a <hi>living</hi> Shield between <hi>ours</hi> and his Father's <hi>Vengeance</hi>! which, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the <hi>greatness</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Person, and of <hi>our</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness, is such a <hi>stupendious</hi> expression of <hi>Love,</hi> as no <hi>Romance</hi> of <hi>Friendship</hi> ever thought of! And what is the proper <hi>influence</hi> of all this love, but to <hi>oblige</hi> us for ever to <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> in the <hi>bands</hi> of a <hi>reciprocal</hi> affection; to <hi>melt</hi> down our <hi>stubbornness</hi> and <hi>enmity</hi> against them, and <hi>draw</hi> us on to our <hi>duty</hi> with the <hi>Cords</hi> of an <hi>invincible</hi> indearment? For is it possible my <hi>sins</hi> should be as <hi>dear</hi> to <hi>me</hi> as the <hi>Son of God</hi> was to his own <hi>Father,</hi> and yet the Father left <hi>him</hi> out of love to <hi>me,</hi> and shall not I leave <hi>them</hi> out of love to <hi>him</hi>? And when the Son of God hath been so <hi>kind</hi> to <hi>me</hi> as to lay down his <hi>life</hi> for me, can I be so <hi>ingrateful</hi> to <hi>him</hi> as to <hi>doat</hi> upon those <hi>sins</hi> which he <hi>hated</hi> more than all the <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>torment</hi> which he endured on <hi>their</hi> account; <hi>those</hi> sins that were the <hi>cause</hi> of all his <hi>sufferings,</hi> the <hi>Thorns</hi> that gored his Temples, and the <hi>Nails</hi> that pierced
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58668:99"/>
his hands and feet? Sure if we are not utterly <hi>lost</hi> to all that is <hi>modest</hi> and <hi>ingenuous, tender</hi> or <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive</hi> in Humane Nature, it will be impossible for us to <hi>resist</hi> these <hi>endearing</hi> instances of the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which carry <hi>warmth</hi> and <hi>fervour</hi> enough with them to <hi>melt</hi> the most <hi>obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate</hi> natures.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Christ's Death and Sacrifice is also to be considered as a <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> ground of our <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>pardon,</hi> if we <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend.</hi> For it was upon the <hi>vertue</hi> of <hi>Expiatory</hi> Sacrifices that all <hi>Mankind</hi> depended for their <hi>reconciliation</hi> with God; and therefore <hi>these</hi> Sacrifices were a <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> part not only of the Religion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> too, who besides their <hi>Eucharisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> had their constant <hi>Expiatory</hi> Oblations to <hi>atone</hi> and <hi>pacifie</hi> their Gods. And this more especially in times of publick <hi>Danger</hi> and <hi>Calamity,</hi> when they conceived their Gods to be <hi>most</hi> offended with them; at which Seasons they were wont to offer up their most <hi>costly</hi> Sacrifices, and devote not only Hecatombs of <hi>Beasts</hi> to their Altars, but many times the more precious lives of <hi>Men, Women,</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> imagining that the more <hi>valuable</hi> the life was, the greater <hi>vertue</hi> there was in it to <hi>appease</hi> the <hi>angry</hi> Deity. And upon this sacred Rite did all the World build their <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> with God, as being conscious that by their sin they had <hi>forfeited</hi> their <hi>own</hi> lives to him, and that there was no other way to <hi>redeem</hi> them, but by making a <hi>commutation</hi> with him, and offering him <hi>another</hi> life for their <hi>own,</hi> which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <gap reason="foreign">

But alas so miserably <hi>defective</hi> were the very <hi>best</hi> of their Sacrifices, that they could not rationally <hi>depend</hi> on them with any <hi>confidence</hi> or <hi>assurance.</hi> For as for the <hi>Heathen</hi> Sacrifices, God had never <hi>promised</hi> to <hi>accept</hi> them, and it being an act of pure <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> in him to <hi>admit</hi> of such a <hi>commutation,</hi> it wholly depended on his own <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi> whether he would <hi>admit</hi> it or <hi>no</hi>; and without some <hi>express</hi> revelation it was impossible for them to know <hi>which</hi> way his Will was <hi>determined</hi> in the case. And then even their most <hi>precious</hi> Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were the lives of <hi>Men,</hi> were infinitely <hi>short</hi> in value to <hi>redeem</hi> the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> of those that offered them; those sacrificed <hi>men</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinners <hi>themselves,</hi> and they but a <hi>few</hi> sinners for <hi>many.</hi> And as for the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sacrifices, though God in many cases had <hi>promised</hi> to <hi>accept</hi> them in commutation for the lives of their <hi>Bodies,</hi> yet those being only the lives of <hi>Brutes,</hi> which were but <hi>negatively</hi> innocent, as being <hi>incapable</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Vertue,</hi> could <hi>merit</hi> nothing of God, and consequently were infinitely <hi>short</hi> of a <hi>valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> commutation for the <hi>forfeited</hi> lives of their <hi>Souls.</hi> All which considered, there was no <hi>rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> on them for <hi>Redemption</hi> from the Obligation they lay under to <hi>eternal</hi> punishment. But now all these <hi>defects</hi> are abundantly <hi>supplied</hi> in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie of our blessed Saviour. For his life was not only <hi>infinitely</hi> valuable by reason of his personal Union to the Godhead, and so in it self an <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi> Ransom; he was not only <hi>no</hi> Sinner, which the <hi>best</hi> of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Sacrifices were; he was not only <hi>Negatively</hi> innocent, which was all that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sacrifices were; but he was also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58668:100"/>
                  <hi>righteous,</hi> and by vertue thereof infinitely <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> to God; and, to crown all, God himself both by express <hi>Revelation,</hi> and by <hi>raising</hi> him from the <hi>dead,</hi> hath openly declared his <hi>acceptance</hi> of his precious bloud, as a <hi>Ransom</hi> for the sins of the World. And upon this most <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> ground stands our <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>reconciliation</hi> with God. So that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud of this our <hi>meritorious</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice we openly behold the <hi>mercy</hi> of God <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> us into <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> and with <hi>out-stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> arms ready to <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>embrace</hi> us; which gives us the most effectual <hi>encouragement</hi> in the World to return to our duty. I confess if we had no <hi>such</hi> Sacrifice to depend on, the sence of our <hi>past</hi> guilts might justly <hi>discourage</hi> us from all thoughts of <hi>future</hi> repentance; for though the natural <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>benignity</hi> of God might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily give us some <hi>small</hi> hope, yet on the other hand the consideration of his natural <hi>abhorrence</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> and the mighty Obligations he lies under to <hi>punish</hi> it, as he is a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> Governour, would very much <hi>dash</hi> our hope out of <hi>countenance.</hi> So that the <hi>utmost</hi> encouragement we could have had, would be that which the King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> gave his People, <hi>Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not?</hi> Jonah 3.9. But <hi>now</hi> we can certainly <hi>tell,</hi> that if <hi>we</hi> will turn from <hi>our</hi> sins, <hi>he</hi> will turn from <hi>his</hi> anger; for our hope depends not on a doubtful <hi>peradventure,</hi> but upon a <hi>full, perfect,</hi> and <hi>sufficient</hi> Sacrifice, <hi>paid down</hi> to, and <hi>accepted</hi> of God. What then should hinder <hi>us</hi> from <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning</hi> to him, who are thus <hi>firmly</hi> assured of his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58668:100"/>
gracious <hi>reception,</hi> and do <hi>certainly</hi> know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, that all our <hi>past</hi> provocations shall be <hi>blotted out,</hi> and our <hi>penitent</hi> Souls <hi>embraced</hi> with the same <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> as if we had <hi>never</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and lastly, This Sacrifice of Christ is also to be considered as the <hi>Seal</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> Covenant. For thus of old <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> between God and Men were wont to be <hi>seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>transacted</hi> by <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> So <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> by God's Command, being to strike <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with him, offered a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which he <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> in the middle, laying each <hi>Moyety</hi> one against the other, <hi>between</hi> which God passed in the likeness of a burning Lamp, and so made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, saying, <hi>Vnto thy Seed will I give this Land</hi>; in which Rite of passing <hi>between</hi> the parts, <hi>God</hi> condescended to the manner of <hi>Men</hi>; for so the <hi>Iews,</hi> when they struck Covenant with God, were wont to cut the Sacrifice <hi>in sunder,</hi> and pass <hi>between</hi> the parts thereof, <hi>Ier.</hi> 34.18, 19. by which action they made this <hi>imprecation</hi> on themselves, <hi>Thus let me be divided and cut in pieces if I violate the Oath I have now made.</hi> And accordingly, the bloud of the Sacrifice is called by <hi>Moses, The bloud of the Covenant,</hi> Exod. 24.8. and the <hi>Iews</hi> are said to <hi>make a Covenant with God by Sacrifice,</hi> Psal. 50.5. For all <hi>Expiatory</hi> Sacrifices were regularly attended with <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> in both which the <hi>Priest</hi> or the <hi>People</hi> were God's <hi>Guests,</hi> and in token of <hi>reconciliation</hi> did <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> with him of the provisions of his <hi>Altar</hi> or <hi>Table.</hi> For in the <hi>burnt-offerings,</hi> the <hi>sin-offerings,</hi> and the <hi>trespass-offerings,</hi> the <hi>Priests</hi> only,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58668:101"/>
as the <hi>Proxies</hi> and <hi>Representatives</hi> of the People, were admitted to be God's <hi>Guests</hi>; but then in the <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> which followed them, the <hi>People</hi> themselves were admitted to his <hi>Table</hi> to partake with him of those <hi>sacred</hi> Viands. So that in the first the <hi>Priests,</hi> as the Peoples <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> struck Covenant with God for them, in the second <hi>they</hi> struck Covenant with God for <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> Thus as it was the Custom of all Nations to solemnize their <hi>Covenants</hi> with one another, by <hi>eating</hi> together, so <hi>God,</hi> in <hi>condescension</hi> to the manner of men, and to <hi>confirm</hi> their <hi>Faith</hi> in his <hi>Promises,</hi> did by the <hi>same</hi> Rite engage himself in Covenant with them. And in the same manner the Sacrifice of our blessed Lord was a <hi>Seal</hi> and <hi>Ratification</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> Covenant; upon which account it is called, as the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sacrifices were, <hi>the bloud of the Covenant,</hi> Heb. 10.29. Heb. 13.20. For his Sacrifice upon the Cross was the meritorious <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> in which <hi>he,</hi> as the <hi>High-Priest,</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Representative</hi> of his Church, did solemnize the New Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, and obtained of his Father an inviolable <hi>Ratification</hi> of his <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Eternal life.</hi> For in that <hi>dreadful</hi> transaction God did <hi>solemnly</hi> engage himself to Christ in the behalf of his Church, to <hi>perform</hi> to her what he had <hi>promised,</hi> to the <hi>utmost,</hi> upon the <hi>terms</hi> spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the New Covenant. And therefore Christ is said to have <hi>made reconciliation in his own body on the Cross, and to have slain the enmity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Eph. 2.16. and to have <hi>made peace,</hi> that is, a Covenant of <hi>peace, through the bloud of the Cross,</hi> Col. 1.20. But then to this <hi>Sin-offering</hi> there
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58668:101"/>
follows a <hi>Peace-offering,</hi> and that is the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> in which the Church, for <hi>her self,</hi> by <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> at this Table, strikes <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with God, and upon those holy <hi>signs</hi> of Christ's <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bloud,</hi> gives <hi>to,</hi> and receives <hi>from</hi> God assurance of mutual <hi>Amnesty</hi> and <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>; and hence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 20. this holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is called, <hi>The Communion of the Body and Bloud of Christ,</hi> and <hi>drinking the Cup of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>being partakers of the Table of the Lord.</hi> For when God in this Supper doth by the hand of his Priest <hi>present</hi> his <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to us, he doth thereby <hi>renew</hi> his <hi>Covenant</hi> with us, and when we <hi>receive,</hi> and <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> God's <hi>Viands, we</hi> thereby renew <hi>our</hi> Covenant with <hi>him.</hi> Thus God in great condescension to our <hi>desponding</hi> minds hath been pleased to <hi>ratifie</hi> his <hi>Covenant</hi> with us in our <hi>own</hi> way and manner; not that this ratification doth render his Covenant <hi>surer</hi> in <hi>it self,</hi> for nothing can be surer than his <hi>promise</hi>; and yet for the <hi>confirmation</hi> of our <hi>diffident</hi> minds, he is sometimes pleased to add his <hi>Oath</hi> to his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> and, for the same reason, to his <hi>Promise</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> he hath superadded these <hi>federal</hi> Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which being the same with those legal <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Rituals</hi> by which <hi>men</hi> were wont to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <hi>their</hi> Covenants and Agreements with one another, are upon <hi>that</hi> account more apt to <hi>assure</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> our minds. And now what a <hi>mighty</hi> influence must this solemn <hi>confirmation</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> Covenant have upon us, to <hi>excite</hi> and <hi>quicken</hi> our Piety and Vertue, and render us <hi>actively zealous</hi> of good Works? For when God hath not only <hi>owned</hi> all the promises of the <hi>New</hi> Covenant to be
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58668:102"/>
his, by the many <hi>miraculous</hi> attestations he hath given them, but hath also vouchsafed by all those <hi>federal</hi> Rites, that were most <hi>sacred</hi> among men, to oblige himself to <hi>perform</hi> them, we have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant reason to believe, not only that it is <hi>he</hi> that hath <hi>promised</hi> all the good things of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but also that he is fully <hi>resolved</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> those promises to us, if <hi>we</hi> perform the <hi>conditions</hi> of them; since by the <hi>Bloud</hi> of his <hi>own Son</hi> he hath engaged himself to <hi>him</hi> in <hi>our</hi> behalf, and by the <hi>Sacramental</hi> signs of the Body and Bloud of his Son he hath engaged himself to <hi>us</hi> in our <hi>own</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to perform what he hath promised to the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> punctilio.

For <hi>now</hi> we are not only assured of his <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> reception, but also of the <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> of his <hi>blessed Spirit</hi> to <hi>back</hi> and <hi>enforce</hi> our <hi>pious</hi> endeavours, and to <hi>enable</hi> us to <hi>conquer</hi> all those resistances of flesh and bloud with which we are to <hi>contend</hi>; and to encourage us to contend with <hi>all</hi> our might, we have an <hi>immortal</hi> Crown of Glory <hi>proposed</hi> to us as the <hi>reward</hi> of our <hi>victory,</hi> and are firmly <hi>assured,</hi> that after we have spent a few <hi>moments</hi> here in the practice of Piety and Vertue, we shall be removed from hence into that <hi>triumphant</hi> state of <hi>Immortality,</hi> there to reign in unspeakable <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> among the blessed <hi>Conquerors</hi> above, and sing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> with them
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58668:102"/>
                  <hi>for ever.</hi> For to all these <hi>blessed</hi> things we are <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled</hi> by the <hi>ratifications</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> Covenant. Having therefore these <hi>great</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> Promises <hi>sealed</hi> to us by the <hi>bloud</hi> of <hi>Iesus, Let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord</hi>

               <p>And thus you see how <hi>effectually</hi> the Death of Christ, as it is a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for sin, <hi>contributes</hi> to our <hi>reformation.</hi> But after all, it must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that it contributes only as a <hi>concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> cause with our <hi>own</hi> endeavours; it doth not work upon us as if we were <hi>dead</hi> Machines, that have no <hi>vital</hi> principle of action in us; nor yet as <hi>necessary</hi> Agents, that have no <hi>free-will</hi> or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>self-determination</hi>; it <hi>draws</hi> us indeed, but it is with the <hi>cords of a man, i. e.</hi> with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>perswasion,</hi> but doth not <hi>drive</hi> or <hi>hale</hi> us with any <hi>violent</hi> or <hi>irresistible</hi> Agency. For after all the <hi>powerful</hi> influence of his Death to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> and <hi>amend</hi> us, we are still in our <hi>own</hi> disposal, and so may <hi>resist</hi> and <hi>baffle</hi> the efficacy of his Death, and in <hi>despite</hi> of it continue in our wickedness if we <hi>please.</hi> But if we <hi>do,</hi> it is at our own <hi>eternal</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, and we must one day expect to <hi>answer,</hi> not only for the bloud of our <hi>own</hi> souls, which in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite of the most <hi>powerful</hi> method of saving them we have wilfully <hi>ruined</hi> and <hi>destroyed,</hi> but also for the bloud of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which we have not only <hi>defeated,</hi> but <hi>trampled on</hi>; and if <hi>both</hi> these be brought to our account, it had been better for us, not only that <hi>we</hi> had never been born, but that our Saviour <hi>himself</hi> had never been born, since all that he hath done to save us will be brought in judgment against us, as an horrid <hi>aggravation</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:58668:103"/>
of our <hi>guilt,</hi> to <hi>inflame</hi> the reckoning of our <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi> So that unless we <hi>concur</hi> with this great <hi>design</hi> of Christ, by <hi>endeavouring</hi> our own <hi>reformation</hi> to the utmost of our <hi>power,</hi> his Death will not only be as <hi>insignificant</hi> to <hi>our</hi> happiness as it is to the redemption of <hi>Devils,</hi> but even those <hi>vocal</hi> wounds of his, which were made to <hi>plead for,</hi> will <hi>accuse</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> us, and that <hi>eloquent</hi> Bloud, which in its Native Language speaks better things for us than the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> will like the Souls under the Altar, raise a cry of vengeance on us as high as the Tribunal of God.

               <p>I NOW proceed to the <hi>second</hi> Act of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's <hi>Priesthood,</hi> corresponding to that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Priesthood, in which it was <hi>typified</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, viz.</hi> his <hi>presenting</hi> his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God in Heaven, thereby to <hi>move</hi> God, as our <hi>Advocate,</hi> to be <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>propitious</hi> to us. In discoursing of which I shall endeavour,</p>
               <p>First, To <hi>explain</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> of that <hi>Advocation</hi> which he performs by <hi>presenting</hi> his <hi>sacrificed body</hi> in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To shew the <hi>admirable</hi> tendency of <hi>this</hi> Method of God's communicating his <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>favours</hi> to us, through the <hi>Intercession</hi> and <hi>Advocation</hi> of our Saviour to <hi>reduce</hi> and <hi>reform</hi> Mankind.</p>
               <p>As for the First, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> of this our Saviour's <hi>Advocation</hi> for us in Heaven, it may be thus defined, <hi>It is a solemn address of our blessed Saviour to God the Father in our behalf, wherein by presenting to him his own Sacrificed body, and by continuing and perpetuating the presentation of it, he doth effectually move and solicite him graciously to receive and accept our Prayer, and to impower him to bestow on us all those graces and favours, which
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58668:104"/>
in consideration of his Sacrifice God hath promised to us.</hi> For the better understanding of which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition I shall distinctly explain the several parts of it, which are these four:</p>
               <p>First, It is a <hi>solemn address</hi> of our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to God the Father in <hi>our</hi> behalf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Address is performed by the <hi>presenting</hi> his <hi>Sacrificed body</hi> to the Father in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>perpetuated</hi> by the <hi>perpetual</hi> Oblation or presenting of this his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed body.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In <hi>vertue</hi> of this perpetual Oblation he doth always <hi>successfully move</hi> and <hi>solicite</hi> God; and this,</p>
               <p>First, To <hi>receive</hi> and graciously <hi>accept</hi> our <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> Prayers; and,</p>
               <p>Secondly, To <hi>impower</hi> him to bestow on us all those <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>favours</hi> which in <hi>consideration</hi> of his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> God hath <hi>promised</hi> to us.</p>
               <p n="1">I. This <hi>Advocation</hi> of Christ in Heaven is a <hi>solemn address</hi> to the Father in <hi>our</hi> behalf. And this is implied in the very word <hi>Advocation</hi>; for the proper business of an <hi>Advocate</hi> is to <hi>address</hi> in the behalf of his <hi>Client,</hi> to the <hi>Party</hi> with whom he is <hi>concerned,</hi> or to <hi>plead</hi> the <hi>Cause</hi> of his Client with some Person with whom he hath some <hi>difference,</hi> or from whom he expects some <hi>favour.</hi> Now <hi>S. Iohn</hi> tells us, that <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> 1 John 2.1. which must therefore necessarily imply his <hi>addressing</hi> to the Father in <hi>our</hi> behalf, in order to the <hi>composing</hi> that <hi>difference</hi> which sin hath made between <hi>him</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> and to the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:58668:104"/>
for us his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>favour.</hi> For in this sence the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we here render <hi>Advocate,</hi> is generally used among all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, <hi>vide Outram de Sacrif. p.</hi> 360. And so also the word <hi>Intercession</hi> signifies to address <hi>for</hi> one person <hi>to</hi> another, in order to the <hi>reconciling</hi> some matter of <hi>difference</hi> between them, or to the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> from the <hi>one</hi> some favour for the <hi>other.</hi> And therefore since Jesus Christ is said to <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for us at the right hand of God,</hi> Rom. 8.34. this <hi>Intercession</hi> also must necessarily imply his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>application</hi> to God in <hi>our</hi> behalf.

               <p n="2">II. This address is performed by the <hi>presenting</hi> his <hi>sacrificed body</hi> to the Father in <hi>Heaven.</hi> For thus, as was shewed before, the High Priest's address to <hi>God,</hi> for the <hi>People,</hi> consisted in <hi>present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>bloud</hi> of the <hi>sacrifice</hi> to him, in sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it <hi>upon</hi> and <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> which was the <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>divine Majesty.</hi> For he made no <hi>vocal</hi> Prayer for them in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and consequently he performed not his <hi>intercession</hi> by <hi>words,</hi> but by <hi>actions</hi>; and the <hi>principal</hi> action he performed there was <hi>sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> the <hi>bloud</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which action was a very <hi>significant</hi> Intercession, importing <hi>this</hi> Sense, <hi>O God, I beseech thee, accept this bloud which I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee for the lives of thy People which are forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thee.</hi> And accordingly our blessed Saviour after he had offered up himself a Sacrifice for our sins upon <hi>Earth,</hi> ascends into <hi>Heaven,</hi> the true <hi>Antitype</hi> of the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents not his <hi>bloud</hi> but his <hi>sacrificed body</hi> to the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58668:105"/>
Father, <hi>that</hi> body which not long before <hi>bled</hi> and <hi>died</hi> on the Cross, and which, as it seems <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> carried with it all the <hi>wounds</hi> it received in its <hi>Crucifixion</hi>; for by the story of <hi>Thomas</hi> it is <hi>certain</hi> it retained them after its <hi>Resurrection.</hi> And by thus <hi>presenting</hi> his <hi>sacrificed body</hi> to the Father, he did what the High Priest did when he <hi>sprinkled</hi> the <hi>bloud</hi> of his <hi>Sacrifice, i. e.</hi> he <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded</hi> for us with God; and indeed he interceded more <hi>prevalently</hi> by this <hi>significant</hi> action, than if he had used all the <hi>Eloquence</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels.</hi> For his wounds are <hi>vocal,</hi> and his bloud <hi>speaks,</hi> yea, and not only <hi>speaks better things for us than the bloud of Abel</hi> spoke, but also expresses what it speaks far more <hi>powerfully</hi> and <hi>emphatically</hi> than it is possible for any <hi>verbal</hi> Oratory to do. So that by the presenting to his Father his <hi>wounded</hi> and <hi>bleeding</hi> body, which carries with it an <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible</hi> fountain of <hi>Rhetorique</hi> and <hi>Persuasion,</hi> he makes the most <hi>moving</hi> and <hi>pathetical</hi> interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for us, the <hi>sense</hi> of which is <hi>this,</hi> though the full <hi>force</hi> and <hi>Emphasis</hi> of it no Language can express, <hi>O my Father behold this sacrificed body of mine, which, by thy consent and approbation, hath been substituted to bear the punishment which was due to thee from Mankind; and through the wounds of which I have chearfully poured out the precious bloud of God, as a ransom for the sins of the World; for the sake of this bloud therefore be thou so far propitious to those miserable sinners it was shed for, as, upon condition they shall repent, to accept it in exchange for the lives of their Souls which are forfeited to thee, to release them from the Obligation they are under to die eternally, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58668:106"/>
upon their final perseverance in well-doing to crown them with eternal life; and that this bloud which at thy command I have willingly shed for them may not, through their inability to repent and persevere, be utterly ineffectual to them; O send thy Holy Spirit to assist their weak faculties, to excite their endeavours, and co-operate with them. This</hi> is the <hi>Language</hi> of Christ's <hi>sacrificed body</hi> in Heaven, and <hi>these</hi> are the <hi>better things which his bloud bespeaks for us.</hi> For his bloud bespeaks those good things for us in <hi>Heaven</hi> for which he shed it upon <hi>Earth, i. e.</hi> the <hi>remission</hi> of our <hi>sins,</hi> and our <hi>eternal life</hi>; of which blessings his <hi>bloud</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>price</hi> that God had promised to <hi>accept,</hi> his <hi>presenting</hi> it to him in Heaven not only <hi>speaks for,</hi> but humbly <hi>demands</hi> them, as carrying with it the <hi>unanswerable</hi> claim of an <hi>accepted</hi> Price to a <hi>stated</hi> Purchace. So that this <hi>address</hi> which Christ makes for us to God in heaven is not performed by him after the manner of a <hi>prostrate</hi> Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, with <hi>bended</hi> knees, <hi>up-lifted</hi> hands, and <hi>lowly</hi> supplications, but in such a manner as comports with the <hi>Kingly</hi> Majesty he is advanced to, and so as at the same time to <hi>assert</hi> his own <hi>right</hi> of <hi>purchace</hi> in the blessings he addresses <hi>for,</hi> and yet to <hi>acknowledge</hi> God to be the supreme <hi>fountain</hi> and <hi>disposer</hi> of them. And this the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tells us he performs by <hi>appearing in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God for us,</hi> and <hi>presenting</hi> his <hi>sacrificed body</hi> to him as a <hi>standing</hi> motive to <hi>prevail</hi> with him to be <hi>propitious</hi> to us, and to <hi>crown</hi> us with all those <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>favours</hi> in consideration of which he laid down his life for us. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he is said to <hi>offer himself</hi> to God for us in

heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25. and to <hi>offer his one Sacrifice, i. e.</hi> to God in heaven, <hi>for sin for ever,</hi> Heb. 10.12. By which <hi>offering</hi> or <hi>presenting</hi> his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> to God, he doth at once <hi>claim</hi> for us by the <hi>right</hi> of his <hi>purchace</hi> all those <hi>good</hi> things for which he paid down the price of his bloud, and also by a <hi>silent</hi> desire <hi>pray</hi> to God to <hi>bestow</hi> them upon us, whereby he acknowledges <hi>him</hi> to be the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign <hi>disposer</hi> of them. So that this <hi>significant</hi> action of Christ's <hi>presenting</hi> his <hi>sacrificed body</hi> to God is both a <hi>Claim</hi> and a <hi>Prayer,</hi> or rather it is a Prayer <hi>backt</hi> and <hi>enforced</hi> with a rightful claim to the <hi>blessings</hi> he prays <hi>for.</hi> For so for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular blessing of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> he himself tells us, <hi>I will pray the Father and he shall give you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comforter, that he may abide with you for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> John 14.16. not that he offers up any <hi>other</hi> Prayer to the Father but what his wounds and bloud <hi>continually</hi> make, which with <hi>incessant</hi> importunity do <hi>move</hi> and <hi>solicite</hi> God in our behalf; but his meaning is this, by <hi>presenting</hi> that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to my Father in <hi>Heaven,</hi> which I am going to <hi>offer</hi> on the <hi>Cross,</hi> and by which, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>other</hi> blessings, I shall <hi>purchace</hi> of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> for you, I will <hi>pray</hi> him to send his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to you, I will <hi>pray</hi> him by my <hi>wounds</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> which are a thousand times more <hi>moving</hi> and <hi>eloquent</hi> than any <hi>vocal</hi> Prayer I can offer in your behalf; for while <hi>they</hi> pray him to send his <hi>Spirit</hi> to you, they lay an undeniable <hi>claim</hi> to what they pray <hi>for,</hi> as being the <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>inestimable</hi> price by which I am <hi>purchasing</hi> his <hi>Spirit</hi> for you. From all which it is evident that this <hi>address</hi> which Christ <hi>now</hi> makes for us to his

Father in <hi>Heaven,</hi> consists in the <hi>presenting</hi> his <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed body</hi> to him, by which he both <hi>prays</hi> to him, and <hi>claims</hi> what he prays <hi>for.</hi>

For it is by the <hi>presence</hi> of his <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed body</hi> that he <hi>intercedes,</hi> and therefore <hi>so long</hi> as his body is <hi>present</hi> in Heaven, <hi>so long</hi> he must be <hi>interceding</hi> by it in our behalf. So that between the <hi>Iewish</hi> High Priest's Intercession and <hi>Christ</hi>'s there is <hi>this</hi> vast difference, that the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> presented himself in the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> with his Sacrifice, and consequently interceded <hi>by</hi> it, but <hi>once a year, viz.</hi> on the <hi>great</hi> day of <hi>Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> whereas the <hi>latter continually</hi> presents his Sacrifice in Heaven, and so doth <hi>continually</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede <hi>by</hi> it; and whereas the <hi>bloud</hi> which the High Priest presented was so <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>inconsiderable</hi> that the whole <hi>vertue</hi> of it was still <hi>spent</hi> in <hi>one</hi> Act of Intercession, as not being available enough for him to intercede with it <hi>twice,</hi> insomuch that in every <hi>new</hi> act of Intercession he was still fain to present <hi>new</hi> bloud; the <hi>bloud</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> was of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58668:107"/>
that infinite <hi>moment</hi> and <hi>value</hi> as that though he makes a <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>perpetuated</hi> Intercession by it, yet the <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>efficacy,</hi> the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency</hi> of it with God remains <hi>fresh</hi> and <hi>unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,</hi> so that he needs not sacrifice <hi>again</hi> that so he may have <hi>new</hi> bloud to present, but with that which he shed 1600. years ago he <hi>still</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for us with the same <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>success</hi> as when he <hi>first</hi> presented it to his Father in Heaven. Upon which account there was no need <hi>that he should offer himself often, as the High Priest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the holy place every year, with bloud of others: for then must he have often suffered, since the foundation of the World; but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to take away sin by the sacrifice of himself,</hi> Heb. 9.25, 26. So that Christ's <hi>one</hi> Sacrifice being of <hi>perpetual</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacy, and being, as <hi>such, perpetually</hi> presented to the Father in heaven, he therewithal makes a <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>uninterrupted</hi> Intercession for us, and will <hi>continue</hi> to do so to the end of the World. Hence we are said to be <hi>sanctified through the offering of the body of Iesus once for all,</hi> Heb. 10.10. And <hi>whereas every Priest stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth daily ministring and offering oftentimes the same Sacrifices which can never take away sin, this man after he had offered one Sacrifice for sins for ever sate down on the right hand of God,</hi> vers. 11, 12. and this <hi>offering his one Sacrifice for sins</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven being <hi>for ever,</hi> it is a <hi>perpetually</hi> continued act of Intercession for us. For so it is said that <hi>he ever lives to make intercession for us,</hi> Heb. 7.25. <hi>i. e.</hi> he ever lives in Heaven, so as by his perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>presence</hi> there to make perpetual <hi>Intercession</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:58668:108"/>
for us. And upon the account of the <hi>perpetuity</hi> of this his Priestly Act of Intercession he is said to have <hi>an unchangeable Priesthood</hi> not barely <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he continues for ever,</hi> for so he might have done and yet <hi>

And hence also he is said to be <hi>a Priest for ever after the Order of Melchisedeck,</hi> that is, not only to be a <hi>Royal Priest,</hi> as <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was, which, as I shewed before, was the proper Character of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck</hi>'s Priesthood, but to be a Royal Priest <hi>for ever,</hi> Heb. 7.17. For <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was not only a <hi>Royal</hi> Priest, but also a <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Shadow</hi> of an <hi>eternal Royal</hi> Priest; and that, as he was <hi>without Father, and without Mother, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,</hi> or Genealogy, <hi>having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God, abideth a Priest continually,</hi> Heb. 7.3. where the Phrase <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>without descent,</hi> or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy, explains what is meant by <hi>without Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and without Mother, i. e.</hi> without any Father or Mother <hi>mentioned</hi> in the <hi>Genealogies</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi>; so the <hi>Syriac</hi> version, <hi>whose Father and Mother are neither of them recorded in the Genealogies</hi>; in which he very much differed from the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Priests, whose Fathers and Mothers names were constantly <hi>recorded</hi> in the Jewish Genealogies, as appears from <hi>Esdr.</hi> 11.62. and so also <hi>Philo</hi> on the Decalogue tells us, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> the descent and Progeny of the Priests is kept with all manner of exactness. So that there being <hi>no</hi> Genealogy at all of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58668:108"/>
he is introduced into the History like a man <hi>dropt down from Heaven,</hi> for so the Text goes on, <hi>having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, i. e.</hi> in the History of <hi>Moses,</hi> which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its common usage, when it makes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of great men, takes <hi>no</hi> notice at all of the time, either of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi>'s <hi>birth</hi> or <hi>death</hi>; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is <hi>made like unto the Son of God, i. e.</hi> by the History of <hi>Moses,</hi> which mentions him <hi>appearing</hi> and <hi>acting</hi> upon the <hi>Stage</hi> without either <hi>entrance</hi> or <hi>exit,</hi> as if like the Son of God he had <hi>abode a Priest continually.</hi> So that as <hi>Moses</hi>'s History treats of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> without taking any notice of his beginning or end, as if he were a Royal Priest for ever, so <hi>Christ</hi> in truth and reality <hi>is</hi> a Royal Priest for ever, because by the <hi>perpetual</hi> Oblation and presenting his Sacrifice to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he <hi>perpetually</hi> exercises his Priesthood, and makes a <hi>continued</hi> intercession for Mankind.</p>

               <p>Since therefore the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t was the great <hi>consideration</hi> upon which the Father <hi>granted</hi> to him the <hi>blessings</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> in our behalf, and since it is by <hi>presenting</hi> that Sacrifice, and in the <hi>vertue</hi> of it, that he <hi>intercedes</hi> with the Father <hi>for</hi> those blessings, we may confidently <hi>assure</hi> our selves he cannot <hi>fail</hi> of <hi>success,</hi> because he intercedes with a <hi>righteous</hi> God, of whom by <hi>presenting</hi> to him the <hi>consideration</hi> of his <hi>grant,</hi> he hath acquired a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>obtain</hi> the blessings he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes <hi>for.</hi> For <hi>now</hi> he intercedes for us with the <hi>price</hi> of our <hi>Redemption</hi> in his <hi>hands,</hi> so that he doth not act <hi>precariously,</hi> or as a <hi>meer</hi> Orator, that <hi>begs</hi> and <hi>supplicates</hi> without any <hi>claim,</hi> and so may be <hi>denied</hi> and <hi>rejected</hi> without any <hi>injustice,</hi> but whatsoever he <hi>asks</hi> he asks in the <hi>right</hi> of his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> by <hi>accepting</hi> of which <hi>inestimable</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the Father hath <hi>obliged</hi> himself to <hi>grant</hi> what he aks <hi>for.</hi> So that <hi>now</hi> he cannot be <hi>denied</hi> those Favours which he <hi>craves</hi> in our behalf, without manifest <hi>injustice,</hi> because by mutual <hi>Contract</hi> between himself and his Father he hath <hi>purchased</hi> to himself a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>obtain</hi> them, and hath <hi>bought</hi> and <hi>paid for</hi> them with his own <hi>bloud.</hi> And how can we imagine that the most <hi>just</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> God can ever be so <hi>outragiously</hi> unjust to his <hi>own</hi> Son, as to be <hi>deaf</hi> to his <hi>Intercessions,</hi> while
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58668:110"/>
he intercedes in the <hi>right</hi> of that precious <hi>bloud,</hi> which his Son <hi>freely</hi> paid, and he as <hi>freely</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in consideration of those blessings he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for? It being therefore evident, by what hath been said, that the <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ is a most <hi>effectual</hi> and <hi>successful</hi> address to the Father, to all the <hi>intents</hi> and <hi>purposes</hi> for which it is made, it now remains only that we give an account to what intents and purposes it is that he makes this address to the Father:</p>
               <p>First, Therefore it is to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>solicite</hi> him graciously to <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>accept</hi> our <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> Prayers; and,</p>
               <p>Secondly, To obtain of him <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> to <hi>bestow</hi> on us all those <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Favours</hi> which in consideration of his Sacrifice God hath <hi>promised</hi> us.</p>
               <p n="1">I. One <hi>intent</hi> or <hi>purpose</hi> of Christ's making this address to the Father, is to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>solicite</hi> him graciously to <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>accept</hi> our <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> Prayers. For thus the <hi>Incense</hi> which the <hi>Priests</hi> offered <hi>twice a day</hi> upon the <hi>Golden Altar,</hi> and which the <hi>High-Priest</hi> offered <hi>once a year</hi> in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> was a <hi>Symbol</hi> or <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem</hi> of the Prayers of the People, which they <hi>mystically</hi> offered up to God <hi>with</hi> it; and hence the Psalmist, <hi>Let my prayers be set forth before thee as Incense,</hi> Psalm 141.2. and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> calls the Odours that filled the Golden Vials, <hi>the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 5.8. and that the Prayers of the Saints were offered <hi>with</hi> the Incense upon the Golden Altar, is evident from <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. And accordingly while the High-Priest was offering the Incense in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> the People
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58668:110"/>
in <hi>their</hi> Court offered up their <hi>silent</hi> and <hi>mental</hi> Prayers to God; for so <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 50.15, 18, 19, 21. we read that whiles <hi>Simon</hi> the High-Priest was offering the Incense to God, <hi>all the People fell on their faces to the ground, and besought the Lord most High in prayer, till the Ministry of the Lord was done, i. e.</hi> till the High-Priest had offered the Incense; and <hi>S. Luke</hi> makes mention of the <hi>Peoples praying without in the time of Incense,</hi> Luke 1.10. By all which it is evident, that this <hi>fuming</hi> of the <hi>Incense</hi> by the Priests and High-Priest, was nothing but a <hi>mystical</hi> Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those <hi>Prayers</hi> to God, which the People were pouring out while the <hi>Mystery</hi> was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Since therefore the High-Priest was a <hi>Type</hi> of Christ, and his entrance into the <hi>Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> a <hi>Type</hi> of Christ's entrance into <hi>Heaven,</hi> his offering Incense <hi>there,</hi> which was a <hi>mystical</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the People, must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be a <hi>Type</hi> of Christ's <hi>offering</hi> and <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending</hi> our Prayers to his Father, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised his Disciples he would perform when he came to <hi>Heaven,</hi> John 16.26, 27. <hi>In that day ye shall ask in my name, and I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you,</hi> which in our Saviour's way of expression (which is, when he mentions <hi>two</hi> things, to <hi>pass by,</hi> and seemingly <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> that so he may the more <hi>illustrate</hi> and <hi>amplifie</hi> the <hi>other, Vide</hi> John 12.4. Joh. 5.45, 46, 47.) plainly implies that he <hi>would, for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me.</hi> And therefore it is <hi>through him</hi> that we are said to <hi>have access unto the Father,</hi> Eph. 2.18. and <hi>by him to have access to the divine grace,</hi> Rom. 5.2. and <hi>in him to have
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58668:111"/>
boldness and access with confidence,</hi> Eph. 3.12. and Rev. 8.3. he is represented as that <hi>Angel</hi> of the Covenant, <hi>who at the Golden Altar before God, doth offer up the prayers of the Saints, incensed</hi> by the merit of his Sacrifice. For it is the Sacrifice of Jesus that <hi>hallows</hi> and <hi>consecrates</hi> all our <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>good works,</hi> the <hi>best</hi> of which have so many <hi>sinful</hi> defects and imperfections cleaving to them, as would render them <hi>abominable</hi> to the pure and holy God, were they not <hi>purged</hi> and <hi>expiated</hi> by this great <hi>Propitiation.</hi> And though Prayer be a duty we stand <hi>eternally</hi> obliged to by our continual <hi>dependence</hi> upon God, yet in this <hi>degeneracy</hi> of our <hi>Nature</hi> there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sins do still accompany our Prayers, as that were they not <hi>expiated</hi> by some very <hi>acceptable</hi> and <hi>meritorious</hi> satisfaction, the cry of them would drown the cry of our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and for ever hinder their access to the divine <hi>ear</hi> and <hi>aceptance.</hi> So that it is only in the <hi>vertue</hi> of that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> with which our Saviour <hi>intercedes</hi> for us in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> that our <hi>Prayers</hi> have <hi>admittance</hi> thither; it is his <hi>bloud</hi> alone that <hi>purifies</hi> our <hi>polluted</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and <hi>out-cries</hi> the guilt of those sins that go along with them. For by <hi>presenting</hi> that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to his Father, with which he made <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> for our sins on the <hi>Cross,</hi> he continually <hi>moves</hi> and <hi>solicites</hi> that those sinful defects which cleave to our Prayers may be <hi>pardoned</hi> and <hi>remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>; upon which motion of his our Prayers are continually <hi>purged</hi> from the <hi>guilt</hi> of those <hi>defects,</hi> and thereupon <hi>introduced</hi> into the divine <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> as <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>innocent, spotless</hi> and <hi>unblemished</hi> devotions. And as by <hi>presenting</hi> his <hi>Sacrifice</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:58668:111"/>
he purges the guilt of our Prayers, so he enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and seconds them. For, as hath been shewn before, the very <hi>presenting</hi> his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is a <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical</hi> Prayer for those <hi>very</hi> blessings which we pray <hi>for</hi>; and not only so, but a Prayer that is <hi>enforced</hi> with a just <hi>claim,</hi> and doth <hi>plead</hi> the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Purchace</hi> to all the blessings it sues for, and so cannot justly be <hi>denied</hi> or <hi>rejected.</hi> And when he <hi>thus</hi> prays <hi>with</hi> us, and continually <hi>joyns</hi> the cry of <hi>his</hi> Bloud to the cry of <hi>our</hi> Prayers, we may safely <hi>depend</hi> upon it, that we shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and find free <hi>access</hi> to the Throne of God's <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>acceptance.</hi> And hence we are said to <hi>have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies,</hi> that is, to draw near by Prayer to God, <hi>by the Bloud of Iesus, by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the vail, that is to say, his flesh,</hi> Heb. 10.19, 20. And our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self assures us, that <hi>whatsoever we shall ask in his name, he will do it</hi>; and again he repeats it, <hi>If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it,</hi> John 14.13, 14. that is, he will <hi>procure</hi> it for us, by joyning <hi>his</hi> Intercessions with <hi>our</hi> Prayers, for so <hi>ver.</hi> 16. he explains himself, <hi>I will pray the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The other <hi>intent</hi> and <hi>purpose</hi> of his making this <hi>Address</hi> or <hi>Intercession</hi> for us to the Father, is, to obtain of him <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>bestow</hi> on us all those <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>favours</hi> which in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his Sacrifice God hath <hi>promised</hi> us. It is not to move the Father to bestow on us the blessings of the New Covenant <hi>immediately with his own hand</hi> that our Saviour intercedes, but to impower <hi>himself,</hi> as <hi>Mediator</hi> between the Father and us, to bestow them upon us, according
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58668:112"/>
to the <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> upon which they are <hi>proposed</hi> to us. For though it is most certainly true, that <hi>every good and perfect gift comes down from above, even from the Father of Lights,</hi> yet it is <hi>as</hi> certain that they come not down to us from the Father <hi>immediately,</hi> but are all deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to us through the hands of the <hi>Son,</hi> who by his <hi>continual</hi> Intercession obtains <hi>continual</hi> power and authority of the Father to <hi>derive</hi> and <hi>confer</hi> on us all those heavenly gifts. So that as the <hi>High Priest,</hi> when he had presented the <hi>bloud</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> was <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi> by God to <hi>bless the people, vide</hi> 1 Chron. 23.13. even so our blessed Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by presenting his <hi>meritorious Sacrifice</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and in the <hi>vertue</hi> thereof <hi>interceding</hi> for us with the Father, is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually</hi> authorized by him <hi>effectually</hi> to <hi>bless us, i. e.</hi> to <hi>confer</hi> on us the <hi>blessings</hi> of the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> upon the <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> that they are therein <hi>proposed.</hi> For <hi>this</hi> power he obtains of God by his <hi>perpetual</hi> Intercession; and hence he is said to be <hi>able to save all those to the utmost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for us,</hi> Heb. 7.25. where his <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>ability to save us to the utmost, i. e.</hi> to <hi>confer</hi> on us all the <hi>blessings</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributed to his <hi>ever living to make intercession for us,</hi> which is a plain Argument, that the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> of his <hi>Intercession</hi> is to <hi>move</hi> God to <hi>authorize</hi> him to <hi>save</hi> us, seeing that in <hi>answer</hi> to his <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> he is continually <hi>impowered</hi> and <hi>authorized</hi> thereunto. For it is to be considered, that this <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> and the <hi>exercise</hi> of it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to his <hi>Kingly</hi> Office, which he first arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58668:112"/>
                  <hi>to,</hi> and still continues <hi>in,</hi> by vertue of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession</hi>; and indeed herein consists the <hi>Royalty</hi> of his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> in that by <hi>interceding</hi> for us as <hi>Priest</hi> in the <hi>vertue</hi> of his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>continuing</hi> to do so, he <hi>first</hi> obtained, and <hi>still</hi> continues vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Kingly Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> to bestow on us those heavenly blessings he intercedes <hi>for</hi>; and it is to this purpose that he intercedes, <hi>not</hi> that the Father would bestow them on us <hi>immediately,</hi> but that he would <hi>put</hi> and <hi>continue</hi> it in <hi>his</hi> power to bestow them, as <hi>Mediator</hi> between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and us; so that he <hi>acquired</hi> and <hi>holds</hi> his <hi>Royalty</hi> by his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and that <hi>Kingly Power</hi> by which he gives us the blessings of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, God <hi>gave</hi> and <hi>continues</hi> to him by way of <hi>answer</hi> and <hi>return</hi> to his <hi>Priestly Intercession.</hi> And hence he is said upon his <hi>offering one sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for sin for ever, i. e.</hi> upon the <hi>perpetual</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Sacrifice in Heaven, to have <hi>sate down on the right hand of God, i. e.</hi> in the Throne of his <hi>Kingly Power</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> Heb. 10.12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and accordingly <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. we are told, that upon his <hi>ascending up on high, i. e.</hi> to present his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed body in heaven, <hi>he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men,</hi> which necessarily implies, that he had received <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>give</hi> them; and so <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.18. whence these words are quoted, expresses it, <hi>He received gifts for men, i. e.</hi> upon the <hi>presenting</hi> his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as <hi>Priest,</hi> he <hi>received</hi> of the Father those Gifts for men which by his <hi>Kingly power</hi> he afterwards <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed</hi> among them. So that what he <hi>gives</hi> by his <hi>Kingly</hi> power, he <hi>receives</hi> by his <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and both the gifts <hi>which</hi> he gives, and the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58668:113"/>
authority <hi>by</hi> which he gives them, are the <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>returns</hi> of that <hi>perpetual</hi> Intercession which he makes by his <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> And that by his <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> our Saviour hath <hi>acquired</hi> this <hi>Royal</hi> power of <hi>giving</hi> us the <hi>blessings</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> he himself doth plainly enough intimate; for thus of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is one of those great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, he tells his Disciples, <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away, i. e.</hi> to Heaven to intercede for you, <hi>for if I go not away the Comforter will not come, i. e.</hi> he will not come but upon <hi>my</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; <hi>but if I depart I will send him unto you,</hi> namely, by that <hi>Royal Authority</hi> which upon my Intercession I shall <hi>receive</hi> from the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.7. And accordingly St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the Jews that Christ <hi>being exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, i. e.</hi> upon his Intercession in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear, i. e.</hi> the miraculous vertues of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33. And so for <hi>remission of sins,</hi> he tells us, that <hi>he hath the Keys of hell and death,</hi> Rev. 1.18. <hi>i. e.</hi> power to <hi>bind</hi> or <hi>loose,</hi> to <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi>; and lastly for <hi>eternal life,</hi> he expresly tells the Church of <hi>Laodicea, To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me on my Throne, even as I have overcome, and am sate down with my Father on his,</hi> Rev. 3.21. By all which it is abundantly evident that Christ hath a <hi>Royal</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>delegated</hi> to him from the Father upon his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession,</hi> to <hi>grant</hi> and <hi>bestow</hi> all the <hi>blessings</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> upon those that comply with its <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>conditions.</hi> For so all the <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>favours</hi> of God are in Scripture said to be
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58668:113"/>
derived <hi>in, by,</hi> or <hi>through</hi> Jesus Christ; for so <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. God the Father is said to <hi>bless us with all spiritual blessings in or through Christ</hi>; and Rom. 6.23. <hi>Eternal life</hi> is said to be <hi>the gift of God through Iesus Christ our Lord</hi>; and we are said to be <hi>heirs of God,</hi> or inheritors of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, <hi>through Christ,</hi> Gal. 4.7. which plainly implies, that though it is <hi>from</hi> God the Father <hi>originally</hi> that all our mercies are derived, yet it is <hi>through</hi> God the Son <hi>immediately</hi> that they are all derived to <hi>us,</hi> and that whatsoever God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows upon us he bestows by the <hi>hand</hi> of Jesus Christ, whom upon his <hi>first</hi> Oblation of his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> Sacrifice in heaven, and <hi>continual</hi> interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion with it, he <hi>constituted</hi> and <hi>continues</hi> the <hi>Royal distributer</hi> of all his <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>favours</hi> to the World. And therefore since there is no doubt but that <hi>that</hi> which he <hi>obtains</hi> by his <hi>intercession</hi> is the thing which he intercedes <hi>for,</hi> it necessarily follows, that the thing which he intercedes for is <hi>power</hi> to <hi>bestow</hi> on us the <hi>blessings</hi> of the <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> because he hath <hi>actually</hi> obtained <hi>that</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer by his <hi>Intercession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus given as <hi>plain</hi> and as <hi>brief</hi> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as I could of this <hi>second</hi> Priestly Act of our Saviour, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Intercession</hi> for us in <hi>Heaven</hi> by the <hi>continual</hi> Oblation of his Sacrifice there, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the <hi>second</hi> place to shew the <hi>admirable</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this method, of God's communicating his <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Favours</hi> to us <hi>through</hi> the <hi>interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of our Saviour, to <hi>reduce</hi> and <hi>reform</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; which will plainly appear by considering the following particulars:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:58668:114"/>First, This method naturally tends to <hi>excite</hi> in us a mighty <hi>aw</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> of God's <hi>Majesty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It also tends to give us the <hi>strongest</hi> conviction of God's <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>abhorrence</hi> of our <hi>sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It also tends most <hi>effectually</hi> to <hi>secure</hi> us from <hi>presuming</hi> upon God's <hi>mercy</hi> while we <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi> in our <hi>sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It tends to <hi>encourage</hi> us to <hi>draw near</hi> to God with <hi>Chearfulness</hi> and <hi>freedom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, It tends to give us the most ample <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance</hi> of his <hi>gracious</hi> intentions towards us if we <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>return</hi> to our duty.</p>
               <p n="1">I. This method of God's communicating his Favours to us through our Saviour's intercession is naturally apt to <hi>excite</hi> in us a mighty <hi>aw</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> of the <hi>divine Majesty.</hi> For in this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi> condition wherein our Nature is <hi>inverted</hi> and turned <hi>upside down,</hi> and our <hi>sensitive</hi> facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have got the <hi>ascendant</hi> of our <hi>Reason, rational</hi> Objects have incomparably <hi>less</hi> force <hi>on,</hi> and prevalence <hi>with</hi> us, than <hi>material</hi> and <hi>sensitive.</hi> And hence it is that we are so <hi>unapt</hi> to be <hi>affected</hi> with the <hi>Majesty</hi> of God, though in it self <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> because it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>purely spiritual,</hi> is objected only to our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and doth not <hi>strike</hi> upon our <hi>sense</hi> with the <hi>Rays</hi> of a <hi>visible</hi> glory. And hence it was that under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> God so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhibited himself to mens <hi>eyes,</hi> in <hi>sensible</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, as particularly sometimes in a <hi>humane shape,</hi> and sometimes in a <hi>body of light</hi> or of <hi>shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flame,</hi> that so by making an <hi>impression</hi> of his great Majesty on their <hi>sense</hi> he might affect them
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58668:114"/>
with a sutable <hi>aw</hi> and <hi>dread</hi> of it. And for the same reason that he <hi>conversed</hi> with them in these <hi>sensible</hi> appearances, he also <hi>treated</hi> with them by a <hi>Mediator</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>; for God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that bounds should be set round about the Mountain which the People were forbid upon peril of death to <hi>break through unto the Lord to gaze,</hi> and only <hi>Moses,</hi> their <hi>Mediator,</hi> together with his Brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> were permitted to <hi>ascend</hi> the Mount, and to have <hi>immediate</hi> access to him; and by thus keeping them at a <hi>distence</hi> from his <hi>sacred</hi> presence, and only suffering them to <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> him by their <hi>Mediator,</hi> he took an effectual course to inspire their minds with a reverential <hi>aw</hi> of his <hi>divine Majesty,</hi> which is in it self so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>August</hi> that it seems it would have been an high <hi>Prophanation</hi> in them to have conversed with it <hi>immediately.</hi> And accordingly God by keeping <hi>us</hi> at a <hi>distance</hi> from him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing us to have access to him <hi>only</hi> by our <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> expresses the <hi>greatness</hi> of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> which is too <hi>sacred</hi> to be mingled in conversation with <hi>us,</hi> too <hi>sublime</hi> to admit of the <hi>immediate</hi> addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of poor Mortals, yea, and which no Mortal must approach without the <hi>Mediation</hi> of his own <hi>Eternal Son</hi>; for thus <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Sympos.</hi> gives it as an instance of the Majesty of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>i. e.</hi> God doth not mingle himself with men, but all the converse and intercourse between him and us is transacted by the Mediation of Demons. And if it were thought so great an instance of God's <hi>Majesty,</hi> that he would not be <hi>approached</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:58668:115"/>
by us without the <hi>Mediation</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> to what an <hi>infinite</hi> height must he be <hi>exalted</hi> above us, when no <hi>less</hi> a person than he who is <hi>God-man</hi> can so much as give us <hi>access</hi> to him, or <hi>present</hi> our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> at his feet. O! what an <hi>awful</hi> sense therefore of the <hi>Majesty</hi> of God should this consideration beget in our minds! For how can we think of him without <hi>dread</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> when we consider how he is <hi>secluded</hi> by the infinite <hi>sacredness</hi> of his own Majesty from all immediate <hi>converse</hi> and <hi>intercourse</hi> with us, and how he is <hi>exalted</hi> so infinitely <hi>above</hi> us, as that we cannot have access to him so much as by our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> without the interpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Mediator</hi> who is <hi>greater</hi> than the <hi>greatest</hi> of all the <hi>Kings</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>Heaven?</hi> Surely he who can <hi>thus</hi> think of God without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>struck</hi> into a profound <hi>aw</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> of his Majesty, must have a mind so <hi>hardened</hi> against all the <hi>impressions</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> as that no <hi>wise</hi> thought can ever <hi>move</hi> or <hi>affect</hi> it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This method of God's communicating his favours to us through our Saviour's Intercession tends also to give us the <hi>strongest</hi> conviction of God's <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>abhorrence</hi> of our <hi>sins.</hi> For doubtless to convince us how <hi>deeply</hi> he <hi>resents</hi> our <hi>sinful</hi> behaviour towards him, the most <hi>effectual</hi> course he could take, next to that of <hi>banishing</hi> us from his presence <hi>for ever,</hi> was to <hi>exclude</hi> us from all <hi>immediate</hi> intercourse with him, and not to <hi>admit</hi> of any more <hi>addresses</hi> or <hi>supplications</hi> from us but by the <hi>hand</hi> of some <hi>Mediator.</hi> Hereby he plainly demonstrates how infinitely <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>abhorrent</hi> to sin his nature is, that he
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58668:115"/>
will not suffer a <hi>sinful</hi> Creature to come near him but by <hi>Proxy,</hi> nor <hi>accept</hi> of a <hi>service</hi> from a <hi>guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> hand, nor <hi>listen</hi> to a <hi>Prayer</hi> from a <hi>sinful</hi> mouth, till it is first <hi>hallowed</hi> and <hi>presented</hi> to him by a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Mediator. If therefore we are not infinitely <hi>conceited</hi> of our selves, this proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of his cannot but lay us <hi>low</hi> in our own <hi>eyes,</hi> and make us <hi>deeply</hi> sensible of our own vileness and <hi>baseness.</hi> For how infinitely <hi>detestable</hi> must our <hi>sins</hi> be in his eyes, when notwithstanding all his <hi>kindness</hi> and <hi>benevolence</hi> towards us, he keeps us at such a <hi>distance</hi> from him, and will not be prevailed with, without some <hi>powerful</hi> interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so much as to <hi>hear</hi> our <hi>Prayers,</hi> or to have any kind of <hi>communication</hi> or <hi>intercourse</hi> with us? And accordingly you find that when the three Friends of <hi>Iob</hi> had treated him so <hi>despitefully</hi> and <hi>uncharitably,</hi> God to manifest his <hi>displeasure</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, commands them to make use of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Mediation, <hi>Iob</hi> 42.7. <hi>My wrath,</hi> saith he to <hi>Elephas, is kindled against thee, and against thy two Friends, for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Iob hath: therefore take unto you seven Bullocks and seven Rams, and go to my servant Iob, and offer up for your selves a burnt Offering, and my servant Iob shall pray for you, for him will I accept, lest I deal with you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your folly</hi>; as if he should have said, that you may see how <hi>ill</hi> I resent your <hi>severe</hi> and <hi>cruel</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of that <hi>good</hi> man, know, that if you offer to address to me <hi>immediately</hi> for your selves, I will certainly <hi>throw</hi> your Prayers <hi>back</hi> upon your <hi>faces</hi>; as therefore you hope to be <hi>restored</hi> to my <hi>favour,</hi> go to that <hi>injured</hi> Friend of yours, and

                  <hi>beseech</hi> him to <hi>mediate</hi> for you, and I will hear <hi>him</hi> though I will not hear <hi>you.</hi> And after the same manner doth God manifest his <hi>high</hi> displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against <hi>our</hi> sins, that he will not suffer us to <hi>approach</hi> him <hi>immediately,</hi> to present our <hi>Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to him with our <hi>own</hi> hands, but will have them all presented to him by a <hi>hand</hi> that is <hi>more</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him than our <hi>own,</hi> and not only so, but by the <hi>greatest</hi> and <hi>most</hi> acceptable hand in the World, even that of his own <hi>Eternal Son,</hi> the Son of his <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> in whom he is <hi>for ever well pleased.</hi> For it is through <hi>him</hi> alone that we have <hi>access</hi> to the Father, whom our <hi>sins</hi> have so <hi>horribly</hi> incensed against us, that no <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> less <hi>great</hi> and less <hi>dear</hi> to him than his own Son, can prevail with him to be <hi>reconciled</hi> to us upon our most <hi>unfeigned</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or so much as to <hi>accept</hi> of our <hi>humble</hi> Supplications.

               <p n="3">III. This way of God's communicating his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to us <hi>through</hi> the intercession of Christ is also most apt to <hi>secure</hi> us from <hi>presuming</hi> upon
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58668:116"/>
God's <hi>mercy</hi> while we <hi>continue</hi> in our <hi>sins.</hi> There is no one thing doth more universally <hi>obstruct</hi> the <hi>reformation</hi> of men, than their confident <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,</hi> that God will be <hi>merciful</hi> to them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they persist in their rebellions against him. For <hi>all</hi> men have a <hi>natural</hi> notion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>benevolence</hi> of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, together with which all <hi>bad</hi> men have a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> desire to <hi>sin</hi> without <hi>disturbance</hi>; when therefore their <hi>Conscience</hi> begins to <hi>clamour</hi> against their <hi>wickedness,</hi> and to <hi>vex</hi> and <hi>persecute</hi> them for it, the <hi>mercy</hi> of God is the usual <hi>Sanctuary</hi> they fly to. Peace, <hi>froward</hi> Conscience, cry they, God is a most <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Being, <hi>hard</hi> to be provoked, and <hi>easie</hi> to be <hi>pacified; fear</hi> not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>his</hi> mercy is infinitely greater than my faults, and I am sure so <hi>good</hi> a God as he is can never find in his heart to <hi>destroy</hi> his <hi>Creature</hi> and <hi>Off-spring</hi> for such <hi>Peccadillo's</hi> as these. With such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions as <hi>these</hi> they commonly <hi>lull</hi> their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences <hi>asleep,</hi> and so sin on <hi>securely</hi> in despite of all the <hi>threats</hi> and <hi>warnings</hi> of Heaven that <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> about their ears. Now to <hi>prevent</hi> such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions as <hi>these,</hi> and <hi>dash</hi> them quite out of <hi>countenance,</hi> there is no consideration in the world can be more <hi>effectual</hi> than <hi>this</hi> of God's communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his mercies to us <hi>through</hi> the <hi>intercession</hi> of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> For if, notwithstanding the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of his <hi>nature,</hi> he will not be <hi>propitious</hi> to us, no not upon our <hi>repentace,</hi> without being <hi>moved</hi> thereunto by the <hi>powerful</hi> intercession of his own Son, how can we ever expect that he should be propitious to us whether we <hi>repent</hi> or <hi>no?</hi> Is it likely he should be more indulgent to us for our
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58668:117"/>
                  <hi>own</hi> sake, than he is for his <hi>Son</hi>'s sake and our own <hi>together</hi>; or that, when all that his <hi>Son</hi> can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for us is to <hi>receive</hi> us into <hi>favour</hi> in case we will lay down our <hi>Arms,</hi> that we by our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest should prevail with him to <hi>receive</hi> us while we <hi>persist</hi> in our <hi>obstinacy</hi> and <hi>rebellion</hi>; in short, if our <hi>repentance,</hi> which is the <hi>best</hi> thing we can render him, be not sufficient to move him to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us, without being <hi>seconded</hi> and <hi>enforced</hi> with the powerful <hi>Oratory</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>Intercession,</hi> what should move him when we have neither <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> nor a <hi>Saviour</hi> to <hi>intercede</hi> for us? For our Saviour will not <hi>intercede</hi> for us unless we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and our <hi>repentance</hi> will not prevail for us, unless he <hi>intercede</hi>; what hope have we therefore while we continue <hi>impenitent,</hi> when our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <hi>it self,</hi> which is the best thing we can do to move God to be propitious to us, is <hi>insufficient</hi> without Christ's <hi>intercession,</hi> and when without our <hi>repentance</hi> Christ will not <hi>intercede</hi> for us; and if the <hi>tears</hi> of a <hi>penitent</hi> suppliant will not prevail with him without an <hi>Intercessor,</hi> what hope is there that the <hi>affronts</hi> of an <hi>impenitent</hi> rebel should? But suppose we might reasonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume upon the <hi>benignity</hi> of God's <hi>nature,</hi> that <hi>he</hi> will be propitious to us, <hi>notwithstanding</hi> our <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,</hi> yet it is to be considered, that <hi>now</hi> he hath placed the <hi>dispensation</hi> of his <hi>mercy</hi> in the hand of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> who is not left to dispose of it <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily,</hi> as he shall think <hi>fit,</hi> but is <hi>confined</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi> to dispose of it only to <hi>penitent</hi> offenders. For Christ's <hi>Trust</hi> can extend no farther than to dispence God's mercy to us upon the <hi>terms</hi> of that <hi>Covenant</hi> of which he is <hi>Mediator,</hi> which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58668:117"/>
proposes mercy to us only upon condition of our <hi>repentance.</hi> So that <hi>now</hi> we can expect no mercy from God, but what passes through the hands of Jesus our <hi>Mediator,</hi> who cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>violating</hi> his <hi>trust,</hi> dispence the mercy of God to us except we <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend.</hi> For now <hi>God</hi> cannot dispence his mercy to us <hi>immediately,</hi> without <hi>displacing</hi> his Son from his <hi>Mediatorship,</hi> and his <hi>Son</hi> cannot dispence his mercy to us <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally,</hi> without <hi>transgressing</hi> the <hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits</hi> that are prescribed to him; and therefore since God hath restrained <hi>himself</hi> to dispence his mercy only <hi>through</hi> his Son, and restrained his <hi>Son</hi> to dispence it only to <hi>penitents,</hi> for us to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume</hi> upon the mercy of God while we continue <hi>impenitent,</hi> is the greatest <hi>nonsense</hi> in the world; it is to suppose either that God will <hi>cancel</hi> the <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy</hi> of his mercy for <hi>our</hi> sakes, and <hi>resume</hi> the <hi>dispensation</hi> of it immediately into his <hi>own</hi> hands, meerly to <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> us in our Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against him, or that Christ will <hi>betray</hi> the <hi>trust</hi> which his Father hath reposed in him, and dispence his mercy to us <hi>contrary</hi> to his Orders; that is, either that God the <hi>Father</hi> will <hi>depose</hi> his Son for our sakes, or that God the <hi>Son</hi> will be <hi>unfaithful</hi> to the Father for our sakes, both which suppositions are equally <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>blasphemous.</hi> Whilst therefore God proceeds with us in this <hi>established</hi> method of granting his mercy to us <hi>only</hi> through his Son, and confining his Son to dispence it to us <hi>only</hi> upon the conditions of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; to flatter our selves with hopes of mercy while we continue <hi>impenitent,</hi> is to presume both against <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>possibility.</hi>

                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:58668:118"/>IV. This way of God's communicating his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to us through the <hi>mediation</hi> of Christ is also most apt in it self to <hi>encourage</hi> us to approach him with <hi>Chearfulness</hi> and <hi>freedom.</hi> For it is a <hi>natural</hi> effect of <hi>guilt</hi> to suggest to mens minds <hi>dreadful</hi> and <hi>anxious</hi> thoughts of God, and whilst we are under <hi>such</hi> thoughts of him, how is it possible for us to approach him <hi>immediately,</hi> and without any <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Advocate</hi> to <hi>introduce</hi> and <hi>speak for</hi> us, with any <hi>chearfulness</hi> or <hi>freedom?</hi> For with what <hi>confidence</hi> can I address to an <hi>incensed</hi> and <hi>offended</hi> God, purely upon my own <hi>fund</hi> or <hi>interest,</hi> when I am <hi>conscious</hi> of a thousand times more <hi>evil</hi> in me to <hi>provoke</hi> him against me, than of <hi>good</hi> to <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi> me to his favour? Unless therefore I am se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of some <hi>powerful</hi> friend in Heaven, that is infinitely more <hi>acceptable</hi> to God than I can <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly</hi> hope to be, and that will <hi>agitate</hi> for me, and <hi>solicite</hi> my cause with all his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>interest,</hi> my sense of the innumerable <hi>provocations</hi> I have given him to <hi>turn</hi> his <hi>back</hi> upon me, must either render me quite <hi>desperate</hi> of <hi>success</hi> at the Throne of his grace, or cause me to approach it with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable <hi>horrour</hi> and <hi>confusion.</hi> So that my <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse</hi> with God must either be wholly <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,</hi> or rendred very <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>uneasie</hi> to me; because my <hi>slavish</hi> dread of him must either <hi>chase</hi> me from his Altars, or <hi>drag</hi> we to them with <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> and <hi>reluctancy.</hi> And hence it is, that under the sense of our <hi>guilt</hi> we <hi>naturally</hi> fly to the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions</hi> of <hi>others</hi> whom we believe to have <hi>more</hi> interest with God than <hi>our selves</hi>; because we cannot <hi>modestly</hi> promise our selves a free <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and <hi>access</hi> to him upon our <hi>own</hi> account.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58668:118"/>
Which probably was the Reason of the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Demon-worship</hi> among the <hi>Heathens,</hi> whose minds being <hi>stung</hi> with the sense of their own <hi>guilts,</hi> they were not able to approach God without fearful <hi>despondence</hi> and <hi>anxiety</hi>; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they began to <hi>cast about</hi> (as it is <hi>natural</hi> for <hi>guilty</hi> minds to do) how they might procure some <hi>other</hi> Beings, that were in great favour with God, to interpose with him in <hi>their</hi> behalf; and having learned by an universal Tradition, that there was a sort of <hi>middle</hi> Beings, called <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Demons, between</hi> the Sovereign <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> they began to <hi>address</hi> to these, and to <hi>bribe</hi> them with <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>sacred honours</hi> to <hi>intercede</hi> with God in their behalf. And hence <hi>Apuleius de Daemon.

By which it is evident that they thought it very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, in order to God's <hi>accepting</hi> their <hi>addresses,</hi> that they should be <hi>presented</hi> and <hi>recommended</hi> to him by some <hi>better</hi> Beings than <hi>themselves</hi>; their <hi>guilty</hi> minds, it seems, <hi>suggesting</hi> to them that

it would be high <hi>presumption</hi> for such <hi>great</hi> offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as themselves, to <hi>approach</hi> the divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, without being <hi>introduced</hi> and <hi>Patronized</hi> by some more <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Beings. And I am very apt to think that the great cause of that <hi>Spirit of bondage</hi> which possessed the ancient <hi>Iews,</hi> and rendred them so <hi>diffident</hi> and <hi>tremulous</hi> in all their <hi>approaches</hi> to God, was their want of an <hi>explicite</hi> knowledge of the <hi>Mediator.</hi> For what <hi>dismal</hi> and <hi>melancholy</hi> expostulations do we frequently meet with in their addresses to God; such as, <hi>Wilt thou be angry for ever?

And hence the Apostle op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses this <hi>Spirit of bondage</hi> in them to that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Spirit of Adoption, by which we cry Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, i. e.</hi> by which we approach God with great <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>assurance,</hi> and go to him as <hi>Children</hi> to a <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. Now if you would know from whence this Christian <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>assurance</hi> proceeds, the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> will inform you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.21, 22. <hi>Having therefore an High-Priest over the houshold of God, i. e.</hi> to mediate and intercede for us, <hi>let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith</hi>; and <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16 the Apostle urges our having a <hi>compassionate High-Priest in Heaven</hi> to intercede for us, as an argument to encourage us to <hi>come boldly to the Throne of grace.</hi> And indeed what <hi>greater</hi> encouragement can we have to <hi>draw nigh</hi> unto God with an <hi>humble</hi> confidence, than <hi>this</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:58668:119"/>
consideration, that the <hi>highest</hi> Favourite he hath in <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth</hi> is our <hi>Advocate</hi>; and that he is not only infinitely <hi>concerned</hi> for us, as being <hi>akin</hi> to us by <hi>nature,</hi> and having a <hi>compassionate</hi> sense of our <hi>infirmities</hi>; that he doth not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in <hi>our</hi> behalf all the <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> he hath with God as he is the <hi>Son</hi> of his <hi>Essence,</hi> and the <hi>Object</hi> of his <hi>delight,</hi> but that he <hi>ever</hi> intercedes for us in the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> of that <hi>Meritorious Sacrifice</hi> with which he <hi>bought</hi> and <hi>purchased</hi> all those heavenly blessings he intercedes <hi>for.</hi> So that <hi>now</hi> all we have to do is to <hi>return</hi> to God by an unfeigned <hi>repentance,</hi> which if we <hi>do,</hi> he stands <hi>engaged</hi> to <hi>undertake</hi> our <hi>cause</hi>; and what may we not expect from the <hi>Patronage</hi> of so <hi>great</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> a Mediator? For how <hi>great</hi> soever our past <hi>sins</hi> are, his <hi>interest</hi> in Heaven is far <hi>greater</hi>; how <hi>loud</hi> and <hi>clamorous</hi> soever our past <hi>Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are, his <hi>Bloud</hi> and <hi>Wounds</hi> are far <hi>louder</hi>; and how <hi>importunately</hi> soever our past <hi>guilts</hi> may <hi>imprecate</hi> the divine Vengeance upon us, his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions</hi> do far <hi>more</hi> importunately and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently <hi>deprecate</hi> it. So that now we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably doubt of a <hi>free</hi> admission to God in <hi>any</hi> case whatsoever wherein our Saviour will make use of his interest for us with God, and therefore since in <hi>all</hi> cases he doth continually imploy his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest for us, but <hi>only</hi> in that of our <hi>impenitence,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Penitent</hi> sinner in the World hath a <hi>door</hi> of <hi>access</hi> set open to him by the Intercession of <hi>Iesus,</hi> through which he may <hi>freely</hi> enter, and with an <hi>humble</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence apply himself to God for <hi>mercy,</hi> and for <hi>grace to help him in the time of need.</hi> Thus by the Mediation of our Saviour, God hath taken off that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58668:120"/>
                  <hi>Imbargo</hi> which mens guilts had laid upon their <hi>commerce</hi> with Heaven, and made way for a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> intercourse between <hi>himself</hi> and his <hi>Creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. And lastly, This way of communicating his Favours to us through the Mediation of Christ, is most apt to <hi>assure</hi> our <hi>diffident</hi> minds of God's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>intentions</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> to us all the <hi>good things</hi> which he hath <hi>promised</hi> us upon <hi>our</hi> performing the <hi>conditions</hi> of them. It is true, if God had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>promised</hi> them, we should have had abundant reason to <hi>believe</hi> him on his own bare <hi>word,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther <hi>security</hi>; but alas, to be <hi>diffident</hi> and <hi>distrustful</hi> is the <hi>inseparable</hi> property of <hi>guilty</hi> minds, and so <hi>great</hi> is our <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>ill desert,</hi> and so <hi>inestimable</hi> are the <hi>blessings</hi> and <hi>favours</hi> which God promises us, that when we reflect upon <hi>both,</hi> and compare them <hi>together,</hi> it so <hi>confounds</hi> our <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>astonishes</hi> our <hi>Faith,</hi> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>all</hi> the security God hath given us, we can <hi>hardly</hi> believe without <hi>trembling</hi> and <hi>diffidence.</hi> So that had not God given us some <hi>other</hi> security besides that of his own bare <hi>word</hi> and <hi>promise,</hi> it would have extreamly <hi>puzled</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi> to believe that God <hi>sincerely</hi> intended such <hi>mighty</hi> goods for such <hi>unworthy</hi> Subjects. For when ever we reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on our own <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>ill-desert,</hi> we must have looked upon God as our <hi>adverse Party,</hi> as one that was concerned only for his own <hi>right</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> to <hi>retrieve</hi> from us that natural <hi>homage</hi> we <hi>owed</hi> him, and had hitherto unjustly <hi>detained</hi> from him; and we should have been but too apt to <hi>sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,</hi> that when once he had obtained <hi>this</hi> end of us, he would be much <hi>less</hi> concerned to make
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58668:120"/>
good <hi>our</hi> right to <hi>his</hi> promise, than he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his <hi>own</hi> to <hi>our</hi> duty. Now although this had been a most <hi>unreasonable</hi> suspicion after the <hi>God of Truth</hi> had passed his <hi>word</hi> to the <hi>contrary,</hi> yet there is nothing so unreasonable which <hi>guilty</hi> minds are not apt to <hi>suspect</hi>; and therefore out of great <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension</hi> to this <hi>pitiable</hi> infirmity of his <hi>sinful</hi> Creatures, God thought meet, upon his entrance into a <hi>New Covenant</hi> with us, not only to <hi>oblige</hi> himself <hi>thereby</hi> to bestow on us the most <hi>inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable</hi> favours if we performed <hi>our</hi> part, but also to put the <hi>making good</hi> of his Obligation into a <hi>third</hi> hand, namely, into the hand of a <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> who by the nature of his <hi>Office</hi> is as much obliged to secure <hi>our</hi> right as <hi>God's,</hi> as being <hi>equally</hi> concerned for <hi>both</hi> parties; as well that <hi>God</hi> should make good to <hi>us</hi> what he hath <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,</hi> as that <hi>we</hi> should make good to <hi>him</hi> what he <hi>requires.</hi> So that <hi>now</hi> we have no longer to do with God <hi>immediately</hi> as our <hi>adverse party,</hi> but all our intercourse with him is by a <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> who by his Office is obliged to be on <hi>our</hi> side as well as <hi>God's,</hi> and to see that what he hath <hi>promised</hi> be performed <hi>to</hi> us, as well as that what he <hi>requires</hi> be performed <hi>by</hi> us. And hence our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is called <hi>the Mediator of the New Covenant,</hi> and <hi>the Mediator of a better Covenant</hi>; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions plainly bespeak him to be an <hi>Authorized</hi> security on <hi>both</hi> sides, for the <hi>mutual</hi> performance to each other of what they stand respectively <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> to by this Covenant; and hence also he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Sponsor or surety of a better Covenant,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he stands <hi>engaged</hi> for the performance of <hi>both</hi> Parties, so far as it was <hi>possible</hi> for him

to <hi>oblige</hi> them thereunto; for <hi>us,</hi> to oblige us by the <hi>strongest</hi> motives to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>persevere</hi> in <hi>well-doing</hi>; and for <hi>God,</hi> to oblige him by the most <hi>powerful</hi> pleas to <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>crown</hi> us with <hi>eternal life</hi>; the <hi>later</hi> of which he performs by his <hi>Intercession,</hi> wherein by continually <hi>pleading</hi> that precious <hi>bloud</hi> which God hath long since <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi> in <hi>consideration</hi> of our <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>eternal life,</hi> he continually obtains <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> from God to <hi>bestow</hi> on us the blessings he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes <hi>for.</hi> So that <hi>now</hi> we have not only God's <hi>Word,</hi> but also the <hi>Suretiship</hi> of our Saviour to <hi>depend</hi> on; who not only stands <hi>engaged</hi> to us <hi>for</hi> God, that <hi>he</hi> shall <hi>perform</hi> all his <hi>promises</hi> to us, but hath also <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> upon the just <hi>claim</hi> of his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to <hi>oblige</hi> him to perform them.

as <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>inviolable</hi> as his <hi>God-head,</hi> but also to <hi>question</hi> the <hi>security,</hi> and <hi>arraign</hi> the <hi>fidelity</hi> of a <hi>Mediator</hi> that <hi>died</hi> for us; that <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased</hi> for us with his own <hi>bloud</hi> all the blessings which God hath promised us, by vertue whereof he not only <hi>rightfully</hi> claims them of God, but hath also <hi>actually</hi> received them in <hi>our</hi> behalf.

this proposal doth not effectually <hi>influence</hi> our <hi>hope,</hi> and thereby <hi>excite</hi> and <hi>animate</hi> our <hi>endeavours,</hi> it is impossible that <hi>any</hi> encouragement should ever <hi>move</hi> or <hi>affect</hi> us.</p>
               <p>And thus you see, in all these several particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, how <hi>effectually</hi> this way of God's communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his Favours to us through the <hi>Intercession</hi> of our Saviour, tends to our <hi>reformation</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment</hi>; what a <hi>fruitful</hi> Topick of <hi>motives</hi> it is to induce us to <hi>repentance,</hi> and how <hi>pathetically</hi> it <hi>addresses</hi> to every <hi>affection</hi> in us that is <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of <hi>persuasion</hi>; what <hi>awful</hi> and <hi>reverential</hi> thoughts of Almighty God it <hi>suggests</hi> to our minds, to <hi>dispose</hi> our <hi>stubborn</hi> Wills to an <hi>humble</hi> submission to him; what a <hi>horrible</hi> representation it makes of our <hi>sins,</hi> and of God's <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation</hi> against them, and what a <hi>dreadful</hi> alarm it gives to our <hi>fear</hi> to <hi>rouse</hi> and <hi>awake</hi> us out of our <hi>sinful</hi> security; And, in a word, how <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully</hi> it <hi>encourages</hi> us to <hi>draw near unto God,</hi> and to make our addresses to him with an <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> freedom, and what <hi>vast</hi> assurances it gives to our <hi>hope</hi> of his <hi>gracious</hi> intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, if we <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend.</hi> All which considered, one would think it were <hi>impossible</hi> for any man that <hi>believes</hi> and <hi>understands</hi> this <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi> method of mercy, not to be <hi>moved</hi> and <hi>affected</hi> by it; and certainly that man who hath <hi>obstinacy</hi> enough to <hi>withstand</hi> all its <hi>persuasions,</hi> and <hi>finally</hi> to <hi>defeat</hi> and <hi>baffle</hi> those <hi>powerful</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts which it makes to <hi>reclaim</hi> him, is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not to be moved by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Argument.</hi> For in <hi>this</hi> he hath conquered the <hi>greatest</hi> motives of all sorts that can be urged to <hi>persuade</hi> men, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:58668:122"/>
when once he is got beyond the <hi>reach</hi> of <hi>persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and no motive of <hi>ingenuity,</hi> or <hi>hope,</hi> or <hi>fear</hi> can <hi>affect</hi> him, his condition is <hi>desperate,</hi> and his obstinacy <hi>incurable.</hi> Wherefore, as we would not <hi>finally</hi> disappoint this <hi>wonderful</hi> contrivance of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>reclaim</hi> us, and <hi>thereby</hi> render our selves for ever <hi>desperate,</hi> let us at <hi>length</hi> be persuaded <hi>seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> to consider the <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> it proposes to us, and never to cease <hi>urging</hi> and <hi>pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> them upon our own souls, till they have <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered</hi> our <hi>obstinate</hi> Wills and <hi>prejudiced</hi> Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and finally <hi>captivated</hi> us into a <hi>free</hi> compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with their <hi>powerful</hi> persuasions.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58668:123"/>
as he <hi>began</hi> with his <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office, of which his whole life was a <hi>continued</hi> Ministry, so I have treated of <hi>this</hi> Office in the <hi>first</hi> place; and as from his Prophetick he <hi>proceeded</hi> to his <hi>Priestly</hi> Office, <hi>one</hi> part of which he executed on the <hi>Cross,</hi> where he offered himself a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the sins of the World, and the <hi>other</hi> upon his <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> into Heaven, where he <hi>presented,</hi> and still <hi>continues</hi> to present his Sacrifice to the Father by way of <hi>intercession</hi> for us, so I proceeded in the <hi>next</hi> place to treat of his <hi>Priesthood</hi> in <hi>both</hi> the parts of it; and now in the <hi>last</hi> place, in pursuit of the same order, I proceed to his <hi>Regal</hi> or <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Office, which was the <hi>last</hi> he entered upon, after he had <hi>finished</hi> his <hi>Prophecy, offered</hi> his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and <hi>presented</hi> it to his Father in Heaven.

It is true, <hi>before</hi> his Ascension he tells his Disciples, that <hi>all power was given him in Heaven and Earth,</hi> Matth. 28.18. but this it is evident he spake by way of <hi>Prolepsis</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation,</hi> a very usual <hi>Scheme</hi> of speech in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is to express things of <hi>certain</hi> futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as if they were <hi>actually</hi> existing; according to which Scheme <hi>all power is given me</hi> imports no more than <hi>all power is shortly to be given me, i. e.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my <hi>Ascension</hi> into Heaven. For so it is evident our Saviour must be understood in that <hi>parallel</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.22. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son</hi>; which words he spake long before his <hi>Death,</hi> when it is evident, that <hi>all judgment,</hi> i. e. <hi>Vniversal, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> authority was not <hi>actually committed to him</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but there was only a <hi>certain</hi> futurity of it. For so he himself tells us, that his <hi>sitting down with his Father on his Throne,</hi> or investiture with that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> Authority which he now exercises, was the <hi>reward</hi> and <hi>consequence</hi> of his <hi>overcoming,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate victory on the Cross, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. By all which it is evident, that it was upon his <hi>Ascension</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:58668:124"/>
into Heaven, and Oblation of his Sacrifice <hi>there,</hi> by way of <hi>Intercession,</hi> that Christ was installed in his <hi>Vniversal, Mediatorial Kingdom.</hi> It is true, our Saviour had a <hi>particular</hi> Kingdom in <hi>this</hi> World, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Ascension,</hi> but before his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> as I shall shew hereafter; but as for that Right of Dominion over the <hi>Gentile</hi> world too, by which he became <hi>universal</hi> Lord and King, he was not invested with it till his <hi>Ascension</hi> into Heaven. And therefore he himself tells us, that his <hi>Mission</hi> into this world was purely <hi>to the lost Sheep of the house of Israel,</hi> Matth. 15.24. and accordingly in the pursuance of this his Mission, when he sent forth his Ministers to preach his Gospel, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them <hi>not to go into the way of the Gentiles, nor to enter into the City of the Samaritans, but to go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, Matth.</hi> 10.5, 6. which implies that at that time he was not <hi>actually</hi> authorized to <hi>subdue</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> under his dominion, but that his Authority extended only to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation: but when he had told his Disciples, in that <hi>prolep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> speech after his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> that <hi>all power was given him in Heaven and Earth,</hi> it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, <hi>go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. as if he had said, <hi>now</hi> my Commission and Authority is <hi>inlarged,</hi> and I am made <hi>Vniversal</hi> Lord and King, go ye therefore in pursuance of it, and by your Ministry endeavour to reduce <hi>all Nations</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my dominion. And hence it was that the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> of the <hi>calling</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ was not <hi>revealed</hi> till after his <hi>Ascension</hi>

vid. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. because it was <hi>upon</hi> his Ascension that he received his <hi>Vniversal, Kingly</hi> Authority over them, and till <hi>then</hi> it was to no purpose to reveal it. So that it was over the <hi>Gentile</hi> world <hi>peculiarly</hi> that he received Power and Dominion upon his <hi>Ascension</hi> into Heaven; he was King of the <hi>Iews</hi> long before, but upon his Ascension he was invested with a right of Dominion over the <hi>Gentiles</hi> too, and thereupon became the <hi>Vniversal</hi> Lord and Monarch of the World under the most High God and Father of all things: but this I shall have occasion farther to explain hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <head>SECT. VII. Of the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</head>
               <p>AS for the first, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress</hi> of Christ's <hi>Kingdom,</hi> I shall endeavour to give an account of it in these following Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions:</p>
               <p>First, That the Kingdom of Christ is founded upon the <hi>New Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That the new Covenant <hi>commenced</hi> immediately after the <hi>Fall,</hi> and was afterwards particularly <hi>renewed</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That upon its first <hi>Commencement</hi> Christ was the <hi>Mediator</hi> of it, and so he <hi>continued</hi> all along in that particular <hi>renewal</hi> that was made of it to the People of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Therefore that as <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>this</hi> Covenant Christ was <hi>King</hi> of <hi>all</hi> that were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into it, and <hi>particularly</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Posterity, or the People of <hi>Israel</hi> with <hi>whom</hi> it was renewed.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That after his coming into the world he still retained his Title of <hi>King of Israel</hi> in <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> till they finally rejected <hi>him,</hi> and the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> in which his Kingdom is founded.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That though the <hi>main body</hi> of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>rejected</hi> him, yet there was a <hi>Remnant</hi> of it that <hi>received</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> him as their <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Lord and King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:58668:126"/>Seventhly, That <hi>this</hi> Remnant still continued the same <hi>individual</hi> Kingdom of Christ with the former, though very much <hi>reformed</hi> and <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, That to this individual Kingdom of Christ thus reformed and improved was <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added</hi> all those <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to <hi>Christianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, That the Kingdom of Christ is founded in the <hi>New Covenant.</hi> For it is by the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that <hi>he</hi> engages himself to us to be our <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Lord, and that <hi>we</hi> engage our selves to him to be his <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>obedient</hi> Subjects; and from these <hi>mutual</hi> Engagements results the <hi>relation</hi> of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> between him and us. So that the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ consists of all those <hi>People, Nations,</hi> and <hi>Kindreds,</hi> who have been admitted into this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-relation</hi> to him, wherein by a <hi>solemn</hi> Vow of <hi>Fealty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> they have indispensably obliged themselves to <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him; but of this I shall have occasion to discourse more largely hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Therefore this new Covenant <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced</hi> immediately af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er the <hi>Fall,</hi> and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in a particular manner <hi>renewed</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Posterity. For the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was a Plank thrown forth to Mankind <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> after that woful Shipwreck that was made by the Fall. For no sooner had God denounced his <hi>deserved</hi> Doom on our <hi>lapsed</hi> Parents, but to support them from <hi>sinking</hi> into utter <hi>desperation,</hi> he subjoyns that gracious <hi>promise,</hi> Gen. 3.15. <hi>The Seed of the woman shall bruise the Serpent's head</hi>;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58668:126"/>
where by the <hi>Seed of the woman,</hi> not only <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> but the ancient <hi>Iewish</hi> Interpreters understand the <hi>Messias,</hi> and by the <hi>Serpent</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> who in the form of a Serpent had tempted our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to that <hi>fatal</hi> revolt which drew after it all those <hi>miserable</hi> consequents which their Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity have groaned under ever since; by the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias his <hi>bruising the Serpent's head,</hi> is meant his <hi>assaulting</hi> and <hi>crushing</hi> under foot the very <hi>seat</hi> of all his <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and finally <hi>rescuing</hi> mankind from under his <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Tyranny.</hi> For this Promise was the first <hi>dawning,</hi> the <hi>morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Twilight</hi> of the New Covenant; and, so far as we can find, the <hi>only</hi> discovery of it to the <hi>Old</hi> World, and therefore in all probability was the <hi>sole</hi> ground and object of that <hi>faith</hi> by which <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> were <hi>justified</hi> in the sight of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4, 5. For though that Promise was but a <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>obscure</hi> intimation of the <hi>Gospel-Covenant,</hi> yet thus much it <hi>plainly</hi> proposed to them, that from the first Parents of the World there should <hi>descend</hi> a certain Person, who should conquer the <hi>Devil</hi> that had conquered <hi>them,</hi> and thereby repair the damage of <hi>their</hi> Apostasie; by <hi>believing</hi> of which, it seems, and acting <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,</hi> they found <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> in the sight of God; but however it is apparent that the <hi>New</hi> Covenant was in force in the time of the <hi>Old</hi> World, because it is evident both that the <hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>Ante-diluvian</hi> Patriarchs was <hi>actually</hi> accepted by God, and that their faith could up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no <hi>other</hi> account have <hi>been</hi> accepted by him, but only in the vertue of <hi>this</hi> New Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:58668:127"/>But after the Floud God more <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly</hi> renewed this <hi>gracious</hi> Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2, 3. where he promises <hi>to bless him, to make his name great, and himself a blessing, and to bless them that blessed him, and curse them that cursed him,</hi> and <hi>in him,</hi> that is, in the <hi>Messias,</hi> who should descend <hi>from</hi> him, <hi>vid.</hi> Gal. 3.16. <hi>to make all the Families of the Earth blessed</hi>; which Covenant he <hi>again</hi> renews to him, <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. and <hi>Cap.</hi> 15. and then in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. he <hi>yet</hi> again renews it more <hi>largely</hi> and <hi>solemnly,</hi> assuring him not only that <hi>he should be a Father of many Nations,</hi> &amp;c. but that <hi>that</hi> Covenant should extend to his <hi>Posterity</hi> as well as to <hi>him,</hi> and that <hi>he would be a God to him, and to his Seed after him</hi>; immediately after which he institutes the <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>Circumcision</hi> for a perpetual <hi>Seal</hi> and <hi>Ratification</hi> of his Covenant between him and them; and upon this Covenant it was that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church was founded. For so <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi> which was the standing <hi>Seal</hi> of <hi>this</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, was also the standing <hi>Rite</hi> of admission into <hi>that</hi> Church; which is a plain argument, that to be a <hi>Member</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> and a <hi>Confederate</hi> in this <hi>Covenant</hi> was one and the same <hi>thing,</hi> because they were admitted both by one and the same <hi>Rite.</hi> Now from the New Testament it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that this Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> upon which the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church was built, was the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> or <hi>New Covenant.</hi> For so <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. the Apostle calls the delivery of this Covenant <hi>preaching the Gospel to Abraham,</hi> which must be apparently fals, if <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>Gospel Covenant</hi> were not the <hi>same</hi>; and in <hi>verse</hi> 29. he tells them, <hi>if ye be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:58668:127"/>
Christ's, i. e.</hi> true Christians, <hi>then are ye Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's Seed, i. e.</hi> that spiritual Seed to whom the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> extends, <hi>and heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promise, i. e.</hi> of that Covenant; but how could they be <hi>Abraham's seed,</hi> by being Christians, and <hi>heirs to the promise</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, if the <hi>Seed</hi> with whom <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant was made, were of a different <hi>Religion</hi> from Christians, and the Covenant it self were of a different <hi>kind</hi> from the Christian Covenant? But that it was the very <hi>same,</hi> appears yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because, in the first place, it requires the same <hi>Condition, viz.</hi> an <hi>obediential</hi> or <hi>practical</hi> Faith. For so, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. it is said, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham believed in the Lord, and he accounted it to him for righteousness, i. e.</hi> though he had <hi>formerly</hi> been <hi>guilty</hi> of many <hi>sins,</hi> and at <hi>present</hi> could not <hi>chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge</hi> any <hi>reward</hi> from God, yet upon that <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> faith which he exercised, God <hi>acquitted</hi> and <hi>justified</hi> him, or, which is the same thing, <hi>dealt with</hi> him as if he had been <hi>perfectly</hi> righteous; and accordingly his <hi>Circumcision,</hi> which was the <hi>Ratification</hi> of that Covenant, is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. called <hi>the Seal of the righteousness of faith, i. e.</hi> of his <hi>Iustification,</hi> or being <hi>accounted</hi> righteous, and <hi>dealt with</hi> accordingly by God, upon his <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>practical Assent</hi> to God's Promise. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9. thus concludes, <hi>so then they which be of faith, i. e.</hi> sincere Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, <hi>are blessed with faithful Abraham</hi>; in which words he expresly asserts that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> are blessed upon the <hi>same</hi> terms, <hi>viz.</hi> upon an <hi>obediential</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:58668:128"/>And as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s required the same <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with the <hi>New</hi> Covenant, so it also contained the same <hi>Promises.</hi> For although those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises according to the <hi>outside</hi> and <hi>literal</hi> sence of them, do contain only <hi>temporal</hi> blessings, yet it is apparent, that they had all the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> blessings of that New Covenant <hi>lock'd</hi> and <hi>treasured up</hi> in the <hi>mystical</hi> sence of them. For thus <hi>S.

And as for divine <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> to <hi>inable</hi> men to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>persevere</hi> in well-doing, the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> tells us, that one part of God's <hi>performing his truth unto Iacob, and his mercy to Abraham,</hi> consisted in <hi>his subduing our iniquities, and casting our sins into the depths of the Sea,</hi> Micah 7.19, 20.

Since therefore both the <hi>conditions</hi> required, and the <hi>blessings</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s and the <hi>New</hi> Covenant were in all particulars the <hi>same,</hi> it necessarily follows, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of it there was a vast difference; for whereas in the <hi>Gospel</hi> it is revealed throughout with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <hi>clearness</hi> and <hi>perspicuity,</hi> and in <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> terms, it was delivered <hi>vailed</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Posterity under <hi>general</hi> and <hi>obscure</hi> expressions, which at best exhibited to them but a <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused</hi> apprehension of it.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, From the very first <hi>Commencement</hi> of this Covenant Christ was <hi>Mediator</hi> of it, and so hath <hi>continued</hi> all along under that particular <hi>Renewal</hi> of it, which God made to the People of <hi>Israel.</hi> For the Scripture expresly affirms, that he is the <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Surety</hi> of this <hi>New</hi> and <hi>better Covenant,</hi> that is, that it is he who as our <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> with God <hi>obtains</hi> for us the Blessings of this Covenant, and who as our <hi>King</hi> under God <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For besides that, the <hi>Fall</hi> of man was the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> why God withdrew himself from all <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> converse with him, and that therefore it is reasonably to be presumed, that whatsoever converse he had with him <hi>afterwards,</hi> it was through a <hi>Mediator,</hi> there is nothing more evident
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58668:129"/>
from Scripture than that <hi>this</hi> very Covenant, which is the standing <hi>Medium</hi> of God's <hi>converse</hi> and <hi>intercourse</hi> with men, was granted to us by God in <hi>consideration</hi> of Christ's <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> Since therefore it was granted long <hi>before</hi> Christ <hi>died,</hi> even from the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> it must be granted upon Christ's <hi>obliging</hi> and <hi>engaging</hi> himself to the Father to die for us <hi>in the fulness of time</hi>; which engagement of his was <hi>virtually</hi> and in <hi>effect</hi> an <hi>offering</hi> up himself a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for us; God being as much <hi>secured</hi> of it upon <hi>his</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, as if he had <hi>actually</hi> performed it. Upon which account he is called <hi>the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, Rev.</hi> 13.8. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause upon his <hi>obliging</hi> himself to die for us, which was <hi>immediately</hi> after the Fall, the <hi>Event</hi> became as <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> as if in that very <hi>moment</hi> he had breathed out his Soul upon the Cross. And accordingly God <hi>proceeded</hi> on it as on a <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> Fund, and in <hi>consideration</hi> of it <hi>granted</hi> the new Covenant to the World. Hence the Apostle tells us, that it was <hi>by means of his death</hi> that there was <hi>redemption for the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions that were under the first Covenant, Heb.</hi> 9.15. Since therefore it was in consideration of Christ's <hi>future</hi> Sacrifice that God <hi>first</hi> granted this Covenant to men, it necessarily follows, that upon the <hi>same</hi> consideration he at the same time <hi>appointed</hi> Christ to be the <hi>Mediator</hi> of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as I shewed before, he is Mediator in the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> of his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> by which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it; and therefore since his Sacrifice had the same vertue in it when it was <hi>future,</hi> as it hath now when it is <hi>past,</hi> he had the same right to be
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58668:129"/>
Mediator of it <hi>then,</hi> as he hath <hi>now.</hi> In short, Christ's Sacrifice was as <hi>certain</hi> in God's account, and therefore as <hi>prevalent</hi> with him, <hi>before,</hi> as <hi>after</hi> it was offered; and therefore since his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorship</hi> of the New Covenant is wholly owing to the prevalence of his Sacrifice, there was the same reason why God should admit him to be <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> of it <hi>before</hi> it was offered as <hi>after</hi>; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly long before he offered up his Sacrifice, he is called the <hi>Angel</hi> or Minister <hi>of the Covenant, Mal.</hi> 3.1. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly tells us, that four hundred and thirty years before the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> this Covenant was <hi>confirmed of God</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham in Christ,</hi> Gal. 3.17. and if it was then <hi>confirmed in Christ,</hi> it is certain that then Christ was the <hi>Mediator</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Christ</hi>'s being always <hi>Mediator</hi> of this Covenant necessarily implies his having been always <hi>King</hi> under God of <hi>all</hi> that ever were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into it, and <hi>particularly</hi> of the People of <hi>Israel</hi>; because his <hi>Kingly</hi> Office is so <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> a part of his <hi>Mediatorship,</hi> that he cannot be properly a Mediator <hi>without</hi> it. For to mediate as he doth between God and men, is to act <hi>Authoritatively</hi> for and in the behalf of <hi>both</hi> parties; so that if he act only for <hi>one,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be truly said to be a <hi>Mediator</hi> between <hi>both</hi>; but in his acting <hi>Authoritatively</hi> for <hi>God</hi> consists his <hi>Royalty</hi> or <hi>Kingly</hi> Office, as you may see <hi>p.</hi> 7, 8. and if his <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Office necessarily includes a <hi>Kingly</hi> power, to be sure that power must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>all</hi> that ever were admitted into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant upon which he Mediates. For how can any man be admitted into that <hi>Covenant,</hi> of which he
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58668:130"/>
is the <hi>authorized</hi> Mediator, without being subject to all the <hi>Authority</hi> which his Mediatorship neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily implies?</p>
               <p>Hence therefore it follows, that Christ hath been <hi>always</hi> King of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Society</hi> of the true Worshippers of him, in <hi>all</hi> Ages of the world. For thus in the <hi>Old</hi> world St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. that by that very Spirit whereby Christ rose from the dead <hi>he went and preached to the spirits in prison, i. e.</hi> by <hi>Noah,</hi> who by the immediate inspiration of the Holy Spirit was a <hi>Preacher</hi> or Herald <hi>of Righteousness,</hi> Christ preached to the <hi>Spirits</hi> or <hi>Souls</hi> of men, whilst they were yet <hi>shut up</hi> in, and <hi>united</hi> to their <hi>bodies,</hi> long before that general <hi>separation</hi> of their Souls from their Bodies which was made by the Floud; <hi>vid.</hi> Dr. <hi>Ham.</hi> in <hi>Loc.</hi> at <hi>this</hi> time, I say, whilst they were yet <hi>alive,</hi> Christ <hi>preached to them,</hi> to warn them of that general destruction which was <hi>pursuing</hi> them, and would ere long <hi>overtake</hi> them, unless they spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <hi>repented</hi>; which shews that long <hi>before</hi> the Floud Christ acted as a <hi>King</hi> in issuing out by his Heralds his <hi>Royal</hi> Proclamations to men to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> to them, and <hi>warn</hi> them of the fatal consequence of their <hi>disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>Soon <hi>after</hi> the Floud mankind almost <hi>universally</hi> Apostatized from God to <hi>Idolatry</hi>; so that the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Society</hi> of the true Worshippers of him was quickly reduced into a very <hi>narrow</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass; so that four hundred years after it seems very probable th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was the <hi>only</hi> King in the world who was not an <hi>Idolater.</hi> And
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58668:130"/>
now God seeing his Church almost <hi>totally</hi> extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by this <hi>general</hi> defection of mankind from his Covenant; to <hi>recover</hi> and <hi>repair</hi> it, he calls <hi>Abraham</hi> out of his <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and with him and his Posterity <hi>renews</hi> the New Covenant which the rest of mankind had <hi>renounced</hi> and <hi>deserted</hi>; and to <hi>secure</hi> them from <hi>ever</hi> revolting from it, he <hi>seals</hi> and <hi>ratifies</hi> it with them by a sign in their flesh, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> which he gave them as a mark to <hi>distinguish</hi> and preserve them <hi>distinct</hi> from the Idolatrous Nations round about them. And when afterwards the Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> was multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in <hi>Aegypt</hi> into a numerous Nation, and this <hi>Rite</hi> of <hi>Circumcision</hi> being by <hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> derived to <hi>their</hi> Posterity, and so made common to <hi>other</hi> Nations with <hi>Israel,</hi> God to <hi>renew</hi> this distinction gives them the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> upon their coming out of <hi>Aegypt</hi>; one great design of which, even as that of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> was to <hi>diversifie</hi> them from their <hi>neighbouring</hi> Idolaters by <hi>contrary</hi> rites and observances; and hence the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law is called by the Apostle <hi>a middle Wall of partition, Eph.</hi> 2.14. alluding to that middle Wall in the Temple which <hi>divided</hi> the Court of the <hi>Iews</hi> from the Court of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile <hi>Proselytes of the Gate,</hi> who because they were not <hi>circumcised,</hi> were counted <hi>unclean,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account divided from the Circumcised by a Wall of stone of three Cubits high; and a little after, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. he calls this Law <hi>the enmity</hi> between the Jews and Gentiles, because one great design of it was to <hi>divide</hi> and <hi>separate</hi> the Jews from the Gentiles, and thereby to secure them
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:58668:131"/>
from <hi>revolting</hi> from the New Covenant by <hi>ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> and <hi>confounding</hi> themselves with Idolaters. By which means the New Covenant became in a manner <hi>appropriate</hi> to <hi>Israel,</hi> none being allowed <hi>admission</hi> into it but only such as freely submitted themselves to the <hi>distinguishing</hi> Laws of that Communion by which they were <hi>separated</hi> from all other Nations. Hence the Apostle tells us, that <hi>to them pertained the Covenants,</hi> Rom. 9.4. <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>New</hi> Covenant it self, together with Circumcision the Seal of it, which is also called a <hi>Covenant.</hi> And the same Apostle puts together being <hi>Aliens to the Commonwealth of Israel,</hi> and <hi>strangers to the Covenants of Promise,</hi> as insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Concomitants, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. And hence it is that they are stiled God's <hi>peculiar People, Deut.</hi> 14.2. and his <hi>peculiar Treasure,</hi> Psal. 135.4. because by <hi>this</hi> Covenant which pass'd between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>them</hi> they were <hi>separated</hi> to God from all <hi>other</hi> Nations; and upon the same account also they are called the <hi>Lord's portion, and the Lot of his inheritance,</hi> Deut. 32.9. The New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant therefore being thus <hi>particularly</hi> confined to the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> whilst it continued so, Christ who was <hi>always</hi> the <hi>Mediator</hi> of it must be <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly</hi> the <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Head and King, that under the most High God and Father <hi>ruled</hi> and <hi>governed</hi> that Church and People. But because upon the truth of <hi>this</hi> Assertion this <hi>whole</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depends, I shall endeavour, as briefly as I can, to <hi>evince</hi> and <hi>prove</hi> it in these following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions:</p>
               <p>First, That there was a certain <hi>extraordinary</hi> Angel who frequently <hi>appeared</hi> and <hi>spake</hi> to the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58668:131"/>
Jewish Patriarchs, who is sometimes called <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Angel of Iehovah,</hi> who ordinarily assumed to himself <hi>divine</hi> Appellations, and to whom those holy men ordinarily rendered <hi>divine Honours,</hi> and <hi>Vows,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This extraordinary Angel was a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Person, and no <hi>created</hi> Being.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That he was that divine Person that <hi>descended</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and from thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and thence into the <hi>Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, That this divine Person was not <hi>God the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, That he was <hi>God the Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, That there was a certain <hi>extraordinary</hi> Angel, who frequently <hi>appeared,</hi> and <hi>spake</hi> to the Jewish Patriarchs, who is sometimes called <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> &amp;c. Of which I might give innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, but for brevities sake shall only mention two; the first is that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. where we read of three <hi>men,</hi> that is as all agree, three <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>humane</hi> shapes, one of which in <hi>verse</hi> 13. is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly called <hi>Iehovah</hi>; after which upon their going towards <hi>Sodom,</hi> the same <hi>Iehovah</hi> speaks to <hi>Abraham</hi> again, ver. 17. <hi>And Iehovah said, shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing?</hi> and so again <hi>ver.</hi> 20. then in <hi>ver.</hi> 22. it is said, that <hi>the men turned their faces from thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and went up to Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Iehovah, i. e. two</hi> of the Angels went their way to <hi>Sodom</hi>; for so <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 1. we read <hi>but</hi> of two of them that arrived thither; so that the <hi>Iehovah</hi> before whom <hi>Abraham</hi> stood must be the <hi>third</hi> who
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:58668:132"/>
stay'd behind conferring with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in which Conference <hi>Abraham</hi> several times addresses to him under the name of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and <hi>verse</hi> 25. calls him <hi>the Iudge of all the earth,</hi> and then <hi>verse</hi> 33. it is said, that <hi>Iehovah went away when he had made an end of speaking unto Abraham.</hi> The other instance is in <hi>Genes.</hi> 28. from <hi>verse</hi> 12. where you have recorded the Vision of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Ladder, <hi>above which,</hi> ver. 13. it is said, <hi>Iehovah stood and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy Father,</hi> &amp;c. upon which <hi>Iacob</hi> when he awaked cries out, <hi>Surely Iehovah is in this place,</hi> ver. 16. thereupon he <hi>sacrifices</hi> to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. calls the place <hi>Bethel,</hi> or the <hi>House of God,</hi> ver. 19. and offers a <hi>Vow</hi> to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. wherein he obliges himself to acknowledge him for his <hi>God,</hi> ver. 21. but <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 13. this <hi>divine</hi> Person is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both the <hi>Angel of God,</hi> and <hi>the God of Bethel</hi>; and <hi>Iacob</hi> himself in <hi>Gen.</hi> 48 15, 16. calls him <hi>the God before whom his Father Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed him all his life long, and the Angel which redeemed him from all evil.</hi> And with this <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>form</hi> of a <hi>man</hi> we find <hi>Iacob</hi> wrestling a whole night together, supposing him, as it seems, to be an ordinary Angel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 32. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. but understanding afterwards who he was, he <hi>calls the name of the place Peniel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had seen God face to face,</hi> ver. 30. which God in <hi>Hos.</hi> 12.4, 5. is called both <hi>the Angel,</hi> and <hi>the Lord of Hosts.</hi> And this <hi>divine</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, or <hi>Angel of God,</hi> if you pursue the sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, you will find is the very <hi>same</hi> that afterwards appeared to <hi>Moses</hi> in the <hi>burning bush,</hi> &amp; under him conducted <hi>Israel</hi> through the <hi>red Sea</hi> and <hi>Wilderness</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:58668:132"/>
in the appearance of a <hi>Pillar of fire and cloud.</hi> For so he is all along called promiscuously <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and the <hi>Angel of Iehovah,</hi> vid. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2, 4. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.21. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he was a <hi>divine</hi> Person and no <hi>created</hi> Angel, is evident not only from his <hi>assuming</hi> to himself the incommunicable <hi>Name,</hi> but also the incommunicable <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah.</hi> For so he tells <hi>Iacob,</hi> not only that he was <hi>Iehovah God of Abraham his Father, and the God of Isaac,</hi> Gen. 28.13. not only that he was <hi>the God of Bethel, where he anointed a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and vowed a vow to him, Gen.</hi> 31.13. but also that he was <hi>God Almighty, Gen.</hi> 35.11. whereas the Psalmist tells us, that <hi>Iehovah is God's name alone, Psal.</hi> 83.18. and <hi>Almightiness,</hi> as all agree, is an <hi>incommunicable</hi> perfection of God; so that had this Angel been a <hi>created</hi> Being, it would have been the highest degree of <hi>Sacriledge</hi> and <hi>Profaneness</hi> in him to <hi>arrogate</hi> to himself that incommunicable <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Attribute.</hi> I know it is usually objected, that he assumed God's Name and Attributes, not as due to his <hi>Person,</hi> but to his <hi>Character,</hi> as he was the <hi>Embassador</hi> of God, and so <hi>represented</hi> his Majesty; but where, I beseech you, was it ever heard that an Embassador was allowed to assume the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> of his <hi>King?</hi> Would it not be deemed high <hi>Arrogance</hi> at least, if not High <hi>Treason,</hi> for an <hi>English</hi> Embassador in the delivery of his Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie thus to declare himself, <hi>I am that high and mighty Prince</hi> James <hi>the Second, King of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And can it be thought that <hi>God,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Iewish</hi> Oeconomy was so peculiarly
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58668:133"/>
                  <hi>jealous of his honour,</hi> and had such <hi>peculiar</hi> reason for it, considering the infinite <hi>proneness</hi> of that people to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> would not only <hi>permit,</hi> but <hi>authorize</hi> a <hi>Creature</hi> to assume <hi>his</hi> Name and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and not only <hi>avouch</hi> it self to be <hi>God,</hi> but also arrogate his <hi>incommunicable</hi> Perfections and Prerogatives? The <hi>Prophets,</hi> we know, were God's Embassadors as well as the <hi>Angels,</hi> but yet they never presumed to call themselves <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Iehovah,</hi> or to arrogate <hi>Omnipotence</hi> to themselves, which yet they had as much right to do as <hi>this</hi> Angel, supposing him to be a <hi>created</hi> Being; but on the contrary, whereas this Angel always spake in his <hi>own</hi> name, and delivered what he said as his <hi>own</hi> word, the Prophets always spake in a <hi>different</hi> stile, and still ushered in what they delivered with a <hi>thus saith the Lord</hi>; and the same to be sure this blessed Angel would have done, had he been <hi>only</hi> an Embassador from God. But besides that he assumed God's <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi>; he not only <hi>admitted</hi> but <hi>required</hi> divine honours to be rendered to him. For so, as hath been shewn before, he not only <hi>admitted Iacob</hi> to offer <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and a religious <hi>Vow</hi> to him, and therein to <hi>devote</hi> himself to him as to his <hi>God,</hi> but also <hi>required</hi> him to <hi>make</hi> and <hi>dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> an Altar to him at <hi>Bethel, Gen.</hi> 35.1. so also he admitted <hi>Ioshuah</hi> to <hi>fall on his face to the Earth and worship him,</hi> and not only so, but bids him <hi>loose his shooe from his foot,</hi> telling him that <hi>the place whereon he stood was holy,</hi> as being conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by his divine Presence, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 5.14, 15. and the same <hi>command,</hi> inforced with the same <hi>reason,</hi> he gave before to <hi>Moses</hi> out of the <hi>burning
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58668:133"/>
bush,</hi> Exod. 3.5. and to name no more, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a <hi>burnt-offering,</hi> and a <hi>meat-offering</hi> at the hands of <hi>Manoah</hi> and his Wife, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 13.23. And is it likely that any created <hi>good</hi> Angel would ever have <hi>admitted</hi> these things, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how strictly <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was <hi>forbid</hi> by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, at whose feet he fell down to worship him, <hi>See thou do it not, I am thy fellow servant — wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God, Rev.</hi> 19.10. and so again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That he was also that divine Person that <hi>descended</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and from thence removed into the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and thence into the <hi>Temple,</hi> is evident from what is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.22, &amp;c. where we have the History of the <hi>Angel of the Lord's</hi> meeting <hi>Balaam</hi> on the way as he was going to curse the People of <hi>Israel</hi>; now that by <hi>that</hi> Angel there is meant this <hi>divine</hi> Angel, or Angel <hi>Iehovah</hi> appears, first, from <hi>verse</hi> 32. where he tells <hi>Balaam, Behold I come out to be an Adversary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thy way is perverse before me, i. e.</hi> it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that will of mine which I declared to thee, <hi>verse</hi> 12. where it is said, That <hi>God said unto Balaam, thou shalt not go with them, thou shalt not curse the People, for they are blessed,</hi> which is a plain evidence, that this <hi>God</hi> and that <hi>Angel of Iehovah</hi> were the <hi>same</hi> Person. And then, secondly, <hi>verse</hi> 35. it is said that this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Iehovah said unto Balaam, go with the men, but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak,</hi> whereas he that afterwards <hi>spake</hi> unto him, and <hi>instructed</hi> him what he should say to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak,</hi> is expresly called <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Iehovah</hi>; for so <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.4, 5. it is said, that <hi>God met Balaam,</hi> and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58668:134"/>
that <hi>Iehovah put a word into his mouth</hi>; whence it appears, that this <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Iehovah</hi> was the same Person with that <hi>Angel of the Lord</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ws that this Angel was the <hi>Almighty</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>Now this Angel <hi>Iehovah, Balaam</hi> in his inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Parable calls <hi>Iehovah the God and King of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and the <hi>God that brought them out of Aegypt,</hi> Numb. 23.21, 22. which is the very stile of that. God that descended upon Mount <hi>Sinai, I am Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah thy God that brought thee out of the Land of Aegypt,</hi> Exod. 20.2. which is a plain argument, that it was all but one and the same Person.</p>
               <p>But then <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. we have the History of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Appearance of this great <hi>Angel of Iehovah,</hi> who, as we are told in <hi>verse</hi> 1. <hi>came from Gilgal unto Bochim,</hi> and by what he there saith of <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> it is evident that he was that very <hi>God</hi> that came down upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and afterwards dwelt in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi>; for there he declares, that it was he that <hi>made them go up out of Aegypt, and brought them to the Land which he sware unto their Fathers,</hi> which is the language of that God that dwelt in the Tabernacle, <hi>vid. Exod.</hi> 33.1. that it was he that said, <hi>I will never break Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with you, and ye shall make no League with the Inhabitants of this Land, and that they should throw down their Altars: but,</hi> saith he, <hi>ye have not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my voice; why have ye done this? Wherefore I said, I will not drive them out from before ye, but they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:58668:134"/>
shall be as thorns in your sides, and their Gods shall be a snare to you,</hi> ver. 1, 2, 3. which are the very words of God from the Tabernacle, as you may see <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.12, 13. <hi>Numb.</hi> 33.55. which is a plain Argument, that <hi>this</hi> Angel and <hi>that</hi> God that dwelt in the Tabernacle were one and the same Person.</p>
               <p>And then that he was the God that afterwards fix'd his abode in the <hi>Temple</hi> is very apparent. For, besides that no body questions but that it was the <hi>same</hi> divine Person that brought <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> led them through the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> came down upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> resided in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and that afterward removed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Temple,</hi> we have a <hi>particular</hi> evidence, that <hi>this</hi> person was the <hi>Angel Iehovah,</hi> in <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.1. where the Prophet tells us, that he <hi>saw Iehovah sitting on a Throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the Temple</hi>; by which it is evident that he appear'd to him in a <hi>visible</hi> form, else how could the Prophet have <hi>seen</hi> him? and that <hi>sitting,</hi> which is a <hi>Corporeal</hi> Posture; but this the second <hi>ver.</hi> puts out of all doubt, which attributes to him a <hi>face</hi> and <hi>feet,</hi> implying that his appearance was in a <hi>humane</hi> form, the very same in which this <hi>Angel Iehovah</hi> was wont to make his <hi>appearances</hi> to men; and then that Prophet concludes, that <hi>he should certainly die, because his eyes had seen the King, the Lord of Hosts</hi>; which is the same <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible</hi> apprehension that men always expressed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>appearance</hi> of this <hi>Angel Iehovah.</hi> Thus upon the sight of him <hi>Manoah</hi> cries out, <hi>We shall surely die, because we have seen God,</hi> Judg. 13.22. and so also <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. 6.22. and the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58668:135"/>
Children of <hi>Israel, Exod.</hi> 20.19. and <hi>Moses</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.6. So that among the Ancients it seems it was a <hi>received</hi> opinion, that the <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of this <hi>illustrious</hi> one did commonly <hi>abode</hi> death unto those that <hi>beheld</hi> him. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet had the same <hi>dreadful</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon his <hi>vision</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> that all men had before him upon the <hi>appearance</hi> of this <hi>Angel Iehovah</hi> to them, it is at least very probable that <hi>that</hi> God and <hi>this</hi> Angel were the same divine person.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That this divine Person was not the most High <hi>God the Father.</hi> For besides that our Saviour tells the Jews, <hi>that they had not heard the Father's voice at any time, nor seen his shape or appearance,</hi> John 5.37. which is a plain evidence that that <hi>divine</hi> Person who <hi>spake</hi> and <hi>appeared</hi> to their Fathers in a <hi>humane</hi> voice or shape, was not <hi>God the Father,</hi> of whom the same Apostle tells us, that <hi>no man hath seen God at any time,</hi> John 1.18. whereas it is expresly said of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy Elders of Israel, that they saw the God of Israel, viz.</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and, as it is evident from the Text, it was in a <hi>humane</hi> shape that they saw him, for <hi>there was under his feet as it were a paved work of Saphir stone,</hi> Exod. 24.9, 10. and if he appeared to them with <hi>feet,</hi> it is reasonable to suppose that he appeared with all the <hi>other</hi> parts of a humane body, for though <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> tells the People, that <hi>they saw no similitude</hi> on the Mount, <hi>but only heard a voice, Deut.</hi> 4.12. yet this doth not at all hinder, but that <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>seventy Elders</hi> with him <hi>might</hi> and <hi>did</hi>; for
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58668:135"/>
so when <hi>Moses</hi> desired to see the <hi>glory of God</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mount, God tells him, <hi>thou art not able to see my face, i. e.</hi> by reason of the <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>lustre</hi> of it, <hi>for no man shall see my face and live, i. e.</hi> no man can endure without great <hi>hazard</hi> of his <hi>life</hi> the <hi>brightness</hi> and <hi>splendor</hi> of my countenance, and from this passage in all probability sprang that common opinion in mens minds, that <hi>they should surely die</hi> whenever they saw <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>Angel Iehovah</hi>; and then God proceeds, and tells <hi>Moses,</hi> that he would place him <hi>in the Clift of the Rock, and cover him with his hand whilst he passed by,</hi> and that when he was passed by <hi>he would take away his hand,</hi> and permit him to <hi>see his back parts,</hi> Exod. 33.20, 21, 22, 23. by all which it seems evident that this <hi>Apparition</hi> of God upon the Mount, which <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Elders</hi> saw, was in a <hi>humane</hi> form, since it had not only <hi>feet,</hi> but <hi>face,</hi> and <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>back parts,</hi> which is not only a farther Evidence that this <hi>God</hi> was the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Person with that <hi>Angel Iehovah,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared so often in <hi>humane</hi> shape, but also a plain argument that he was not <hi>God the Father,</hi> who, as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> tells us, was never <hi>seen in any shape or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance whatsoever</hi>; besides all which, I say, how can the <hi>Father,</hi> who is the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>supreme</hi> person in the holy Trinity, from whom both the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>holy Spirit</hi> are <hi>sent,</hi> be in <hi>any</hi> sence stiled (as this <hi>divine</hi> Person of whom we are treating is) <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Iehovah?</hi> For the word <hi>Angel,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a <hi>Messenger,</hi> implies some kind of <hi>Inferiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to him whose Angel or Messenger he <hi>is,</hi> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can in no sence be <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> applied to the <hi>most high</hi> God and Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:58668:136"/>Fifthly, and lastly, That this divine Person was <hi>God the Son.</hi> For, First, that it was <hi>he</hi> who appeared to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and particularly to <hi>Abraham,</hi> those words of our Saviour plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.56. <hi>Your Father Abraham rejoyced to see my day, and he saw it and was glad</hi>; where by <hi>Abraham's seeing of Christ's day,</hi> must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be meant his <hi>real,</hi> and <hi>actual,</hi> and <hi>personal</hi> sight of Christ himself; for so the Jews understood it, <hi>Thou art not yet</hi> (say they in the following verse) <hi>fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</hi> As much as if they should have said, How is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that ever thou shouldest <hi>personally</hi> and <hi>actually</hi> see <hi>Abraham,</hi> or he thee, as thy words do import, when as yet thou art not fifty years old, and it is many Ages since that <hi>Abraham</hi> died. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Jews did not <hi>mistake</hi> Christ's sence, it is plain that by <hi>seeing his day</hi> he meant <hi>personally</hi> and <hi>actually</hi> seeing <hi>himself</hi>; but that they did <hi>not</hi> mistake him is evident, because if they <hi>

                     </gap>ad,</hi> Christ ought to have <hi>corrected</hi> them by <hi>explaining</hi> himself into some <hi>other</hi> sence, and not suffer them to <hi>run away</hi> with such a <hi>gross</hi> mistake in a matter of such <hi>mighty</hi> moment; instead of which he plainly <hi>allows</hi> and <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>untenances</hi> their sence in the Answer which he gave them, <hi>verse</hi> 58. <hi>Verily, verily I say unto you, before Abraham was I am</hi>; as much as if he had said, it is no such <hi>impossible</hi> matter as you imagine that <hi>Abraham</hi> should see <hi>me</hi> and I <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:58668:136"/>
with them, and meerly <hi>plaid</hi> upon their mistake; and if <hi>Abraham personally</hi> saw Christ, it is certain that Christ must be that divine Person that <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared</hi> to him. But then</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it was <hi>he</hi> also that brought <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and descended upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> at the gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing the Law to them, <hi>i. e.</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself to be <hi>the Lord their God that brought them out of the Land of Aegypt,</hi> is apparent from <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26. where it is expresly affirmed, that it was Christ's <hi>voice which then did shake the Earth, i. e.</hi> when the Law was delivered in Thunder from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which is a plain argument, that Christ was that <hi>Iehovah,</hi> who came down upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and whose voice caused <hi>the whole Mount to quake greatly,</hi> Exod. 19.18. the same also is evident from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Wherefore he saith, i. e.</hi> the Psalmist, <hi>Psalm</hi> 68.18. <hi>when he, i. e.</hi> Christ (of whom he had been speaking just before, <hi>verse</hi> 7. <hi>ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men</hi>; so that either Christ must be the <hi>Person</hi> of whom the Psalmist <hi>speaks,</hi> or the Apostle must grosly <hi>mis-quote</hi> and <hi>mis-apply</hi> him; and if he be the <hi>same</hi> Person, then from that <hi>Psalm</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: First, That it was <hi>he</hi> that <hi>went before the People,</hi> and <hi>marched with them through the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi> verse 7. to 15. Secondly, That it was <hi>he</hi> that was <hi>among the thousands of Angels in Sinai in the holy place,</hi> and by their <hi>Ministry</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated the Law from thence; <hi>verse</hi> 17. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That it was <hi>he</hi> who was <hi>the God and King, whose goings were seen in the Sanctuary,</hi> ver. 24. Fourthly, That it was <hi>he</hi> who was the God of the <hi>Temple
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58668:137"/>
at Ierusalem,</hi> vers. 29. For all these things are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly spoken of <hi>him</hi> that <hi>ascended on high, and led captivity captive, and received gifts for men,</hi> vers. 18. which the Apostle tells us was <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That it was he also that conducted them through the <hi>Wilderness</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> appears from that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Neither let us tempt Christ as some of them, i. e.</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness, <hi>also tempted,</hi> or as some Copies read it, <hi>as some of them also tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted him, and were destroyed by Serpents</hi>; and although in most Copies <hi>him</hi> be not <hi>expressed,</hi> yet in all it is necessarily <hi>implied</hi>; for if they <hi>tempted</hi> in the Wilderness, it is certain that they tempted <hi>some body,</hi> and to understand by that some body any other than <hi>Christ,</hi> who is the <hi>only</hi> Person before <hi>mentioned,</hi> is against all <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>reason</hi>; against <hi>Grammar,</hi> which allows no other <hi>Accusative</hi> to be understood by the <hi>Verb</hi> than that of some <hi>thing</hi> or <hi>person</hi> aforesaid in the <hi>same</hi> Sentence; against <hi>Reason,</hi> because if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand any <hi>other</hi> Accusative but <hi>him</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> who is the only <hi>Person</hi> afore-mentioned, we must make the Apostle speak <hi>loosely</hi> and <hi>indeterminately,</hi> whereas otherwise it is evident he speaks most <hi>strictly</hi> and <hi>certainly</hi>; for there is no word in the Text but only <hi>Christ</hi> which determines the Accusative that the Verb <hi>tempted</hi> implies; so that if that doth <hi>not</hi> determine it, it must be left wholly <hi>indeterminate,</hi> but if it <hi>doth,</hi> it must be <hi>him</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi>; and to make the holy Oracles speak <hi>loosely</hi> and <hi>vagrantly</hi> where they may as well be understood to speak <hi>strictly</hi> and <hi>determinately,</hi> is not only <hi>impious</hi> but <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:58668:137"/>
If therefore it was <hi>Christ</hi> that some of the Jews tempted in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> it necessarily follows in the first place, that Christ was <hi>with</hi> them there, and secondly, that he was that God <hi>against</hi> whom they spake, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.5. which is the place the Apostle here refers to, where it is said, that <hi>the People spake against God and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Moses,</hi> for which God <hi>sent fiery Serpents among them,</hi> ver. 6. If therefore Christ was <hi>with</hi> them in the Wilderness, and was that God <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> whom they spake in the Wilderness, there is no doubt but that he was that <hi>God</hi> that led them <hi>through</hi> it, and brought them into <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, That it was he who dwelt in the Jewish <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> is evident from <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.41. <hi>These things said Isaias when he saw his glory and spake of him</hi>; the occasion of which words is this; at <hi>ver.</hi> 37. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> takes notice of the <hi>perverse</hi> Infidelity of the <hi>Iews</hi> in not believing in Christ, notwithstanding all the <hi>Miracles</hi> he had shewn them, <hi>ver.</hi> 38, 39, 40. which he shews was no more than what the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> had long before foretold of them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.9, 10. and then he concludes, <hi>ver.</hi> 41. <hi>These things said Isaiah when he saw his glory and spake of him,</hi> where by <hi>his glory</hi> it is evident the Apostle means <hi>Christ</hi>'s glory, and by <hi>speaking of him,</hi> speaking of <hi>Christ</hi>; for so in <hi>ver.</hi> 37. where the discourse begins, it is plain he means <hi>Christ</hi> when he tells us, that <hi>yet they believed not on him,</hi> and in <hi>ver.</hi> 42. it is as plain that he means <hi>him</hi> still, when he tells us, that <hi>nevertheless among the chief Rulers also many believed in him</hi>; and if by <hi>him</hi> he means <hi>Christ,</hi> as all agree he doth, both in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:58668:138"/>
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 37. and 42. either the four Verses between must be included within a <hi>Parenthesis</hi> (which we have no reason to imagine, seeing there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o <hi>note</hi> of a Parenthesis to be found in any Copy, nor doth the discourse it self <hi>require</hi> it, which from Verse to Verse runs all along in a <hi>close</hi> and <hi>continued</hi> dependence) or by <hi>him,</hi> must be meant <hi>Christ,</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 41. <hi>also</hi>; and if it was <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>glory</hi> which <hi>Isaiah saw,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> of whom he <hi>spake,</hi> then it is evident that Christ was the <hi>God</hi> who inhabited the <hi>Temple.</hi> For so in <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.1. which is the place St.<hi>Iohn</hi> here refers to, <hi>Isaiah</hi> tells us, that <hi>in the year that King Vzziah died he saw the Lord sitting on a Throne high and lifted up, and his Train filled the Temple</hi>; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ was this <hi>Lord,</hi> as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> affirms, it is certain from these words that it was <hi>he</hi> who sate upon the <hi>Throne</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and had his Train or Retinue of Angels there.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and lastly, That Christ also was that <hi>Iehovah</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> Lord and King who under the most <hi>high Father</hi> presided over the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, is evident from several places of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,</hi> compared with the <hi>Old,</hi> from whence they are cited. I shall only instance in two, the first of which is <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Wherefore he saith,</hi> that is the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, awake thou that sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light</hi>; which words are a <hi>Paraphrastical</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.1. <hi>Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee</hi>; but now unless we suppose Christ to be this <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Iehovah,</hi> the Prophet is so far from saying here, that <hi>Christ shall give thee light,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58668:138"/>
that he makes no mention <hi>at all</hi> of him; either therefore <hi>Isaiah</hi> says <hi>no</hi> such thing as, <hi>Christ shall give thee light,</hi> which is to give the <hi>lie</hi> to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or else the <hi>true</hi> sense of that saying of <hi>Isaiah, The glory of the Lord is risen upon thee,</hi> must be, that <hi>Christ shall give thee light</hi>; which it <hi>cannot</hi> be, if <hi>Christ</hi> and that <hi>Lord</hi> were two <hi>distinct</hi> persons; but that they are <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same,</hi> is evident from <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.6. <hi>Thus faith Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts, I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no God</hi>; which <hi>divine</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>I am the first, and I am the last,</hi> he else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where gives himself in <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.4. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 48.12. of this Prophecy. Now this very Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> Christ assumes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.11. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last</hi>; so again, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.8. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.13. Now how can we, with any <hi>reverence</hi> to our Saviour, suppose that he would ever have assumed to himself this <hi>distinguishing</hi> Character of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and that in the very same <hi>words,</hi> and without ever explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into a different <hi>sense,</hi> had he not been the very <hi>same</hi> Person? since he could not but foresee that he should hereby endanger the <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading</hi> of his Church, and <hi>tempting</hi> her into a <hi>false</hi> opinion of his Person. For what man that was not <hi>prepossessed</hi> with a <hi>contrary</hi> opinion, would ever have thought that our Saviour did <hi>not</hi> mean <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> to be the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> when he thus <hi>verbatim</hi> applies to himself his <hi>personal</hi> Character without any kind of <hi>restriction</hi> or <hi>explication?</hi> Should any man hear a voice from an invisible Person seriously
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58668:139"/>
pronouncing, <hi>I am William the Conqueror,</hi> (as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> did this voice from Christ, <hi>I am the first and the last</hi>) would he not presently conclude either that <hi>this</hi> Person was the Ghost of that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Prince, or that <hi>that</hi> voice was a designed <hi>delusion?</hi> Since therefore our Saviour declares, that he is <hi>the first and the last,</hi> which is the <hi>essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Character by which <hi>Iehovah the King of Israel</hi> describes himself, and doth no where intimate a <hi>different</hi> sence of this Character as applied to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> from what it signified as applied to the <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> it necessarily follows, that either he meant not <hi>sincerely,</hi> or that himself and that <hi>Iehovah</hi> the King of <hi>Israel</hi> were the same Person. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. which all agree is a Prophecy of our Saviour, he is expresly called the King of <hi>Israel, Rejoyce greatly, O Daughter of Sion, shout O Daughter of Ierusalem, behold thy King cometh unto thee</hi>; the most <hi>natural</hi> sence of which Phrase <hi>thy King,</hi> is he that is <hi>now</hi> thy King, not he that is <hi>hereafter</hi> to be so; and if <hi>then</hi> when this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was delivered, he was King of the <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion,</hi> or People of <hi>Israel,</hi> to be sure he was <hi>always</hi> so; and therefore the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> calls the Temple which was the Palace of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine King of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Temple of <hi>Christ, Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold I will send my Messenger, i. e.</hi> John Baptist, <hi>and he shall prepare my way before me, and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple, even the Angel of the Covenant whom ye delight in, behold he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts</hi>; from whence I infer, first, that this <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> which is the ordinary stile of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> was <hi>Christ,</hi> whose <hi>Messenger</hi> and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:58668:139"/>
fore-runner <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was, vid. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.76. And secondly, That the <hi>Temple,</hi> which was the abode of this Lord of Hosts, was the Temple of <hi>Christ; the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple</hi>; which cannot be meant of <hi>God the Father,</hi> because in the next words he is called <hi>the Angel of the Covenant,</hi> which all agree is <hi>Christ</hi>; if then the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was the Temple of <hi>Christ,</hi> and he was that <hi>Lord of Hosts</hi> that dwelt in it, it necessarily follows, that he was that divine King of <hi>Israel</hi> who under God the Father governed the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church. And now having proved at large this fourth Proposition, which is the <hi>principal</hi> Hinge upon which the <hi>whole</hi> Argument turns, I proceed,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That <hi>after</hi> his coming into the World he still <hi>retained</hi> this his Right and Title of <hi>King of Israel</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> till they finally <hi>rejected</hi> him, and <hi>Apostatized</hi> from that Covenant on which his <hi>Kingdom</hi> is founded. For he did not at all divest himself by his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> of that <hi>Royal</hi> Authority he was vested with as he was the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> and <hi>Son of God, hereafter</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate. For this his <hi>Royal</hi> Authority, as I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, is necessarily implied in his <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torship</hi> of the New Covenant, of which, as I have also shewed, he was <hi>always</hi> Mediator without any <hi>discontinuance</hi> or <hi>interruption.</hi> So long there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the New Covenant continued in force with the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> so long he was their <hi>Mediatorial</hi> King in <hi>particular,</hi> under God the Father. Now it is certain that the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant continued in force with them so long as <hi>they</hi> continued to be the <hi>Church of God,</hi> because
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58668:140"/>
it was the New Covenant that <hi>made</hi> them so; and it is certain they continued the Church of God many years <hi>after</hi> the Incarnation of our Saviour, even till such time as by their <hi>obstinate</hi> rejecting of our Saviour, and <hi>incurable</hi> Apostasie from that Covenant which made them the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God,</hi> they had finally <hi>incensed</hi> him to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> them, to <hi>break off</hi> his <hi>Covenant-relation</hi> to them, and utterly to <hi>dispark</hi> and <hi>un-Church</hi> them. And therefore we find that for several years both our Saviour and his Apostles conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in <hi>close</hi> Communion with the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, frequented <hi>their</hi> Temple and Synagogues, and joyned with <hi>them</hi> in all the Solemnities of their Publick Worship; by which they owned them to be the <hi>true</hi> Church of God, and consequently to be <hi>yet</hi> in Covenant with him. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>they</hi> continued in the New Covenant <hi>after</hi> Christ's Incarnation, Christ must also continue the <hi>Mediator</hi> of that Covenant to them, and consequently <hi>their</hi> Mediatorial King. And hence he is stiled, the <hi>King of the Iews</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Incarnation; for so the Wise-men in their enquiry after him, <hi>Where is he that is born King of the Iews? Matt.</hi> 2.2. And that he was <hi>born King of the Iews,</hi> not merely as he was descended from the Loins of <hi>David,</hi> but by a Title that he had <hi>Antecedent</hi> to his birth, <hi>viz.</hi> as he was the <hi>Son of God, hereafter</hi> to be Incarnate, is evident by that confession of <hi>Nathanael,</hi> Joh. 1.49. <hi>Rabbi thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel</hi>; where his being <hi>the King of Israel</hi> is consequent to his being <hi>the Son of God</hi>; and so <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.13. they who attended him in his progress to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:58668:140"/>
salute him with a <hi>Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord</hi>; which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> makes the accomplishment of that forementioned Prophecy, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Rejoyce greatly, O daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion — behold thy King cometh unto thee sitting on an Asses Colt,</hi> verse 14, 15. And this Title our Saviour assumes to himself in that good confession he made before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> who asking him, <hi>Art thou King of the Iews?</hi> He answered him, <hi>Sayest thou this of thy self, or did others tell it thee of me?</hi> And when <hi>Pilate</hi> presses him for a more <hi>explicite</hi> answer, he tells him, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world</hi>; as much as if he had said, I know the Jews, mine enemies, have insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to thee, that by assuming to my self this Title of <hi>King of the Iews,</hi> I design to usurp the <hi>temporal</hi> Dominion of <hi>Caesar</hi> thy Master; but let not that trouble thee, for though it is most certain that I am King of the Jews, yet <hi>my</hi> Kingship and <hi>Caesar</hi>'s are of a quite <hi>different</hi> nature, and do no way <hi>clash</hi> or <hi>interfere</hi> with one another; for whereas his Kingdom is <hi>Temporal,</hi> mine is purely <hi>spiritual,</hi> and <hi>not of this world</hi>; and when <hi>Pilate</hi> insists far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Art thou a King then?</hi> Jesus answers, <hi>Thou sayest I am a King, i. e.</hi> thou sayest <hi>truly</hi> so, <hi>to this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth,</hi> John 18.33, 34, 35, 36, 37.</p>
               <p>And as he retained the <hi>Title</hi> of King of the Jews after his Incarnation, so we frequently find him <hi>exercising</hi> his <hi>Royal</hi> Authority among them. For in the first place, he not only authoritatively <hi>explained</hi> to them those <hi>old</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Laws of Morality which he delivered to them
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:58668:141"/>
from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and <hi>inforced</hi> them with new <hi>Sanctions</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi>; but he also gave them two <hi>new</hi> Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Baptism,</hi> and that of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> to be continued in force to the end of the world. Secondly, He erected a <hi>perpetual</hi> form of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> in his Church, and gave Commission to his Apostles to <hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>administer</hi> it, and to derive down <hi>their</hi> Commission to all succeeding Generations. Thirdly, he <hi>actually</hi> forgave sins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.2. compared with the sixth, where he doth not only pronounce to one that was sick of the Palsie, <hi>Son, thy sins are forgiven thee</hi>; but declares that he did it by that <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> which <hi>he had upon earth to forgive sins.</hi> All which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acts of <hi>Regal</hi> power, do sufficiently manifest that, even whilst he was upon Earth, he was vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Royal</hi> Authority, and that by assuming our nature he did not divest himself of his ancient <hi>Royalty,</hi> but still continued <hi>King of the Iews</hi> so long as they continued a Church.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That though the <hi>main body</hi> of the People of <hi>Israel rejected</hi> Christ, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon rejected <hi>by</hi> him, yet there was a <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of them that <hi>received</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> him for their <hi>rightful</hi> Lord and King. For so, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> observes, it is foretold of <hi>Isaiah</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Israel, Though the number of the Children of Israel be as the sand of the Sea, a remnant shall be saved,</hi> Rom. 9.27. and accordingly it <hi>proved</hi> in the <hi>event.</hi> For though the much <hi>greater</hi> part of the Jewish Nation <hi>obstinately</hi> persisted in their <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> their <hi>King,</hi> notwithstanding all those <hi>powerful</hi> Arts and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:58668:141"/>
Methods he had used to <hi>reclaim</hi> and <hi>save</hi> them; yet there was a great number of them that <hi>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> received and <hi>loyally</hi> adhered to him. For not only the <hi>Disciples</hi> which he gathered whilst he was upon <hi>Earth,</hi> but also the first <hi>Converts</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Ascension into <hi>Heaven,</hi> were generally of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, within which not only his own <hi>Personal</hi> Ministry was confined, but also the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of his <hi>Apostles</hi> for some time <hi>after</hi> his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension. For so <hi>S. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> tell the Jews, that <hi>it was necessary the Word of God should first have been spoken to them,</hi> Acts 13.46. But this Proposition is so manifest from the whole Gospel, that I shall not need to insist any farther upon it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Therefore that this <hi>Remnant</hi> still continued the same <hi>individual</hi> Church or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ with the <hi>former,</hi> though very much <hi>reformed</hi> and <hi>improved.</hi> For it still remained upon the same <hi>basis</hi> with the former, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the self-same <hi>Covenant</hi> for its <hi>Charter,</hi> which is the <hi>form</hi> that <hi>Identifies</hi> all Societies, and, notwithstanding the perpetual <hi>change</hi> and <hi>renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their <hi>parts,</hi> still continues them the same <hi>individual</hi> Politick bodies. Since therefore that <hi>remnant</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> who <hi>believed</hi> in Christ, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued still in the <hi>same</hi> Covenant with that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>old</hi> Jewish Church was founded, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follows, that they were not a <hi>new</hi> or <hi>distinct</hi> Church, but still remained the same <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual</hi> sacred society with the <hi>old.</hi> So that they were the <hi>unbelieving</hi> Jews that <hi>revolted</hi> from their <hi>old</hi> Church, by <hi>rejecting</hi> the Mediator of that Covenant by which it was <hi>formed</hi> and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58668:142"/>
                  <hi>constituted</hi>; but as for the <hi>believing</hi> Jews, who <hi>imbraced</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> him, they still <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued</hi> in it, and so remained the same continued Church, as being still <hi>united</hi> and <hi>incorporated</hi> by the <hi>same</hi> Charter.</p>
               <p>But though it was the same continued body with the old Jewish Church, yet was it very much <hi>reformed</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> by our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. For, in the first pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce, whereas before it was extremely <hi>corrupted</hi> through the many <hi>false</hi> glosses and <hi>superstitious</hi> traditions of their Elders, and like an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>est Garden, was all overgrown with <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Weeds,</hi> its Religion being almost <hi>dwindled</hi> away into <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and outward <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances,</hi> and <hi>evaporated</hi> into a dead <hi>shew</hi> and <hi>formality</hi>; our blessed Saviour repaired its <hi>ruines</hi> and <hi>decays,</hi> removed its <hi>rubbish,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed its <hi>disorders,</hi> and restored it to its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>purity.</hi> For the great design of all his Sermons and Parables was to <hi>explain</hi> the Laws of it into their <hi>Genuine</hi> sence, and to <hi>rescue</hi> them from the <hi>false</hi> Glosses and Comments of the Scribes and Pharisees; to <hi>reprehend</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> its <hi>hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>formality,</hi> and to <hi>refine</hi> its Religion from all those <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>heterogeneous</hi> mixtures with which it was <hi>dasht</hi> and <hi>sophisticated.</hi> That <hi>Remnant</hi> of the Jews therefore who <hi>believed</hi> in Christ, and <hi>submitted</hi> to his Doctrine, when all the <hi>rest</hi> of them finally <hi>rejected</hi> him, were the same <hi>individual continued</hi> body with the <hi>Old</hi> Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Church, as <hi>purified</hi> and <hi>reformed</hi> from its <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>corruptions.</hi> For by <hi>submitting</hi> to our Saviour's <hi>regulations</hi> they did not commence into a <hi>new</hi> Church, but still continued the <hi>same</hi> body,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58668:142"/>
only with <hi>this</hi> difference, that whereas before it was <hi>distempered</hi> with sundry <hi>corrupt</hi> humours, now it was throughly <hi>purged</hi> and <hi>recovered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as our Saviour <hi>restored</hi> that Church to its <hi>ancient</hi> purity, so, secondly, he <hi>advanced</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> it to a far more <hi>perfect</hi> state than it was in even under its <hi>primitive</hi> Constitution. It is true, as for the Religion of that Church it was for <hi>substance</hi> the same with that which our Saviour and his Apostles taught; it proposed to them the same <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the same <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and the very same <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> concerning this Mediator, to create in them the same <hi>belief,</hi> and oblige them to the same <hi>practice,</hi> only with <hi>this</hi> difference, that whereas it proposed him to <hi>their</hi> belief as <hi>hereafter</hi> to be <hi>incarnate</hi> and <hi>sacrificed,</hi> to <hi>rise</hi> and to <hi>ascend</hi> into heaven; it proposes him to <hi>ours</hi> as <hi>actually</hi> incarnate and sacrificed, and as <hi>actually</hi> risen and ascended; but this is only a <hi>circumstantial</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, since that, as to all the purposes of his Mediation, his <hi>future</hi> Incarnation and Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had the same <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>influence</hi> with his <hi>actual.</hi> But though as to the <hi>main</hi> the ancient <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion was the same with <hi>ours,</hi> yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>clearness,</hi> and <hi>easiness,</hi> and <hi>amplitude,</hi> there is a <hi>vast</hi> difference between them. For, first, as to <hi>clearness,</hi> it is evident that it was much more <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>obscurely</hi> revealed to the ancient <hi>Iews</hi> than it is to <hi>us</hi>; for to <hi>them</hi> it was revealed only either in general Promises, out of which they were fain to argue and deduce <hi>particulars</hi>; or in <hi>temporal</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, that carried a <hi>mystical</hi> sence with them, and <hi>obscurely</hi> implied the <hi>spiritual</hi> blessings which
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:58668:143"/>
the Gospel proposes; or in dark <hi>Types</hi> and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Emblems,</hi> which were <hi>Prophetick Pictures,</hi> or, as the Apostle calls them, <hi>shadows of good things to come.</hi> For thus in that <hi>general</hi> Promise, <hi>In thy Seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed,</hi> was included <hi>Christ,</hi> and all those <hi>particular</hi> blessings which we receive <hi>by</hi> and <hi>through</hi> him; under those <hi>temporal</hi> promises of deliverance from their enemies, and peace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble possession of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was <hi>couched</hi> their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>hell,</hi> and their <hi>eternal</hi> rest and happiness in <hi>heaven</hi>; and under their <hi>legal</hi> Sacrifices, the <hi>all-sufficient</hi> Sacrifice of the blessed Mediator was <hi>exhibited</hi> and <hi>represented</hi> to them; and in a word, under the High Priest's <hi>offering</hi> the bloud of the Sacrifice in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> was <hi>intimated</hi> the Mediator's <hi>intercession</hi> for them in <hi>heaven.</hi> Thus both the <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion were all of them <hi>obscure</hi> revelations of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which is nothing but <hi>Mystical</hi> Judaism, or Judaism <hi>explained</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its spiritual sence and meaning. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Apostle makes a <hi>Iew,</hi> according to the <hi>spiritual</hi> sence of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion, to be the same with a <hi>Christian; for he is not a Iew,</hi> saith he, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a <hi>spiritual</hi> sence, <hi>that is one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, neither is that Circumcision which is outward in the flesh, but he is a Iew who is one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, i. e.</hi> who is a Jew according to the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> sence of Judaism; <hi>and Circumcision is that of the heart, in the Spirit and not in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whose praise is not of men, but of God, Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. and if the <hi>spiritual Iew</hi> be a <hi>Christian,</hi> then the <hi>spiritual Iudaism</hi> must be <hi>Christianity.</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:58668:143"/>
But though this <hi>obscure</hi> revelation of Christianity was sufficient to enable men, that <hi>sincerely</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, to <hi>grope</hi> out their way to eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; yet it is impossible it should ever give them, without some <hi>farther</hi> revelation, a <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>explicite</hi> understanding of it. In <hi>general</hi> they understood that there was a <hi>rich</hi> vein of spiritual <hi>sence</hi> running all through the <hi>Letter</hi> of their Law; that there were <hi>glorious</hi> myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>wrapt up</hi> within those <hi>weak and beggarly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> like <hi>precious</hi> Diamonds under a rough coat. For so not only the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but also <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew in his <hi>Allegories of the Law,</hi> and almost in all his other Writings, makes the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Jewish Religion to be <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> truths; and particularly the <hi>High Priest</hi> and his <hi>Vestments</hi> to be a figure of the <hi>eternal Word</hi> and his <hi>perfections.</hi> And as they understood this in general, so from sundry passages in the book of the <hi>Psalms</hi> it is apparent that the <hi>good</hi> Jews had a prospect beyond the <hi>outside</hi> and <hi>letter</hi> of their Law, even into the Mystical <hi>sence</hi> and <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it; and that through its dark <hi>shadows</hi> they saw a great deal of the <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> of the Gospel. Hence <hi>David</hi> observes in <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.14. that <hi>the secret, i. e.</hi> mystery, <hi>of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he shall shew them his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>; which implies that there was something of a <hi>Cabala</hi> of the <hi>spiritual</hi> sence of the Law among the <hi>true</hi> Israelites, by which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed a great deal farther than the bare <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>outside</hi> of it; especially considering that Prayer of <hi>David,</hi> Psalm 119.18. <hi>Open thou mine

and <hi>Shadows</hi> which had hitherto <hi>covered</hi> and in a great measure <hi>concealed</hi> it from the sight and view of the world. And therefore we need no longer <hi>grope</hi> after it among <hi>Shadows</hi> and <hi>Vmbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> as the good Jews were fain to do under the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Dispensation, those Doctrines of it which before were <hi>all Mystery</hi> and <hi>overcast</hi> with Types and Shadows, being now brought forth from behind the Curtain into <hi>open view,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented <hi>barefaced</hi> to our understandings in a most <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> and <hi>familiar</hi> sense. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> taught the <hi>same</hi> Religion, and only <hi>he</hi> taught more <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>clearly</hi> what <hi>they</hi> taught more <hi>darkly</hi> and <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriously,</hi> it hence necessarily follows, that those <hi>believing</hi> Jews who <hi>received</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> Christ, espoused no <hi>new</hi> Religion, but still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to that <hi>good old</hi> Religion which the <hi>signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant</hi> Rites and Ceremonies of their Law had <hi>all along</hi> preached to them; and that it was only the <hi>unbelieving</hi> Jews who <hi>rejected</hi> Christ's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that were the true <hi>Apostates</hi> from the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> Judaism, which <hi>preached</hi> and <hi>exhibited</hi> to them all those <hi>holy mysteries</hi> of which the Religion of our Saviour is composed; but as for those of them who <hi>believed</hi> in Jesus, they continued sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast in the <hi>mystick</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> sense of their <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> Religion, and though they forsook their old <hi>School-master,</hi> the Law, under which they had been <hi>trained</hi> and <hi>educated,</hi> yet still they retained their old <hi>Lesson.</hi> For the Doctrine of <hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>standing</hi> Doctrine of their <hi>Legal Types,</hi> which <hi>they</hi> taught <hi>darkly</hi> and <hi>obscurely,</hi> but <hi>he</hi> most <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>distinctly</hi>; and therefore though
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:58668:145"/>
those <hi>believing</hi> Jews still continued in the same <hi>Doctrine,</hi> yet they had very good reason to change their <hi>Teacher,</hi> and from being the Disciples of the <hi>Law</hi> to become the Disciples of <hi>Iesus,</hi> under whose instruction they were sure to improve far <hi>beyond</hi> what they had hitherto done under their <hi>old Master.</hi> Since therefore Christianity is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ancient Judaism <hi>explained</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddled,</hi> it hence necessarily follows, that the <hi>believing</hi> Jews, by <hi>embracing</hi> it, did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence a <hi>new Church</hi> distinct from the <hi>ancient</hi> Jewish one, but were the <hi>same</hi> Church, still <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>improved</hi>; the same <hi>Church,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause founded on the same <hi>Religion</hi>; but the same Church <hi>improved,</hi> because enlightened with a far more <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>explicite</hi> knowledge of that Religion.</p>
               <p>And as our Saviour did very much improve the Religion of the Jewish Church in respect of <hi>clearness</hi> and <hi>perspicuity,</hi> so he did also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>easiness.</hi> For besides those many <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to it, as <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of the Gospel, there were sundry <hi>others</hi> superadded to it by the same Law, partly in <hi>conformity</hi> to the more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> Rites of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> among whom the Jews were <hi>educated,</hi> and of whose Rites and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they were pertinaciously <hi>fond</hi>; and partly in <hi>opposition</hi> to their <hi>Magical</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous</hi> ones, <hi>vid. Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 45, 46. For the <hi>Primitive</hi> Jewish Religion was that which the Patriarchs and their Posterity professed and practised <hi>before</hi> the giving of the <hi>Law,</hi> and to which the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law was but a <hi>superaddition</hi>; but by reason of the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:58668:146"/>
vast <hi>number</hi> of Rites and Ceremonies which this Law contained (which yet considering their <hi>state</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> was very <hi>necessary</hi> for them) their Religion was rendered exceeding <hi>cumbersom</hi> and <hi>grievous</hi> to them; and therefore the Apostle justly calls it <hi>a yoke which neither they nor their fore-fathers were able to bear,</hi> Acts 15.10. But our Saviour when he came into the World, who was the <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>accomplishment</hi> of all those <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Types and <hi>Prophetick</hi> Pictures, <hi>unload<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> it of all those <hi>burthensom</hi> appendages, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by restored it to that ancient <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> in which it was <hi>before</hi> that <hi>yoke of bondage</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on it: nay, and not only so, but also ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it more easie than ever, for whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law it had annexed to it that <hi>painful</hi> Rite of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> which was the <hi>Primitive</hi> Seal of that Religion or Covenant, our blessed Saviour exchanged it for a much <hi>gentler</hi> and <hi>easier, viz.</hi> that of <hi>Baptism.</hi> For whereas <hi>Circumcision</hi> was not only an <hi>infamous</hi> Rite among the greatest part of the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, and upon that account unfit to be the <hi>sign</hi> of <hi>initiation</hi> into the Church of Christ, which was now to be <hi>enlarged</hi> and <hi>propagated</hi> through the World; but also a <hi>blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> and <hi>painful</hi> one, and upon that account more apt to affright men <hi>from,</hi> than to ini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iate them <hi>into</hi> his Church; <hi>Baptism</hi> was a Rite that both Jews and Gentiles <hi>reverenced,</hi> and that is very <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>practicable</hi> in its own nature. So that whereas the <hi>ancient</hi> Judaism was rendered a <hi>yoke of bondage</hi> (as the Apostle calls it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.10.) through those <hi>numerous</hi> Rites and Ceremonies that were superinduced upon it, our Saviour <hi>disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:58668:146"/>
it of them <hi>all,</hi> and thereby rendered it an <hi>easie yoke,</hi> as he himself calls it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.30. Since therefore Christianity, for the <hi>main,</hi> is nothing but the ancient Judaism <hi>released</hi> from the <hi>bondage</hi> of the Ceremonial Law, and <hi>restored</hi> to its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>easiness</hi> and <hi>freedom,</hi> it hence follows, that by <hi>embracing</hi> Christ and his Doctrine the <hi>believing</hi> Jews did not turn to a <hi>new</hi> Religion, nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently constitute a <hi>new</hi> Church, but still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in their <hi>Old</hi> Religion, which our Saviour only <hi>bettered</hi> and <hi>improved,</hi> and rendered far more <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>practicable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly and lastly, Our Saviour very much improved the Jewish Church and Religion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>extent</hi> and <hi>Amplitude</hi> of it. It is true, the Gentiles who <hi>embraced</hi> the Jewish <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> were always allowed <hi>admission</hi> into the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish <hi>Church.</hi> For so at first not only <hi>Abraham</hi> himself and his <hi>Children,</hi> but his <hi>Servants</hi> also were admitted into <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> And in the Reigns of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Selden de Iure l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. observes, there were <hi>vast</hi> numbers of <hi>Converts</hi> to the Jewish Church out of all the <hi>Neighbouring</hi> Nations; and in <hi>Ahasuerus</hi>'s Reign <hi>many of the People of the Land,</hi> of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Persia, became Iews, Esther</hi> 8.17. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in <hi>Hyrcanus</hi>'s Reign the <hi>whole</hi> Nation of the <hi>Idumeans</hi> embraced the Jewish Religion; all which, and many more, as the <hi>true</hi> Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>faith,</hi> were by <hi>Circumcision</hi> initiated into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant God made with <hi>him</hi> and his <hi>Posterity,</hi> and thereby became <hi>Co-members</hi> with them of the same <hi>Corporation,</hi> and <hi>Coheirs</hi> to the same <hi>Promises.</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:58668:147"/>
But though the <hi>Gate</hi> of the Jewish Church was never <hi>shut</hi> against the Gentiles, yet, as I shewed before, there were <hi>sundry</hi> of the Rites of that Church instituted on purpose to <hi>divide</hi> and <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> the Jews from the Gentiles, to create a <hi>distance</hi> and mutual <hi>strangeness</hi> between them, that thereby the Jews might be <hi>preserved</hi> and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured</hi> from <hi>mingling</hi> with the Gentile <hi>Idolatries.</hi> Now by these <hi>distinguishing</hi> Rites, which begat an inveter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te mutual <hi>prejudice</hi> between the Jews and Gentiles, the Jewish Church was very much <hi>narrowed</hi> and <hi>contracted.</hi> For in the first place th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se distinguishing Rites by prejudicing the <hi>Iews</hi> against the <hi>Gentiles</hi> restrained <hi>them</hi> from all <hi>free</hi> converse and communication <hi>with</hi> them, and thereby from <hi>propagating</hi> their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>among</hi> them; and secondly, by prejudicing the <hi>Gentiles</hi> against the <hi>Iews,</hi> they also prejudiced <hi>them</hi> against the Jewish <hi>Religion,</hi> and rendered their minds extremely <hi>averse</hi> to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Thus as these Ceremonious <hi>singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities</hi> of the Jewish Church were to the <hi>Iews</hi> great <hi>preservatives</hi> against the <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the Gentiles, so to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> they were very great <hi>hinderances</hi> of their <hi>conversion</hi> to the <hi>Religion</hi> of the Jews. And therefore our Saviour, in order to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of propagating <hi>Christianity</hi> among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> which is the true <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism,</hi> found it necessary to remove from it these <hi>offensive</hi> Rites, which lay as so many <hi>stumbling blocks</hi> in the way to the conversion of the Gentiles to it, and so by <hi>pulling down this middle Wall of partition</hi> between the Jews and Gentiles, and <hi>abolishing this enmity of Ordinances</hi> which created
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:58668:147"/>
such a vast <hi>distance</hi> between them, he <hi>opened</hi> and <hi>prepared</hi> the way to the conversion of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and took a most <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> course to <hi>make peace</hi> between them and the Jews, and to <hi>reconcile them both into one body in the Cross,</hi> and and hereby to <hi>extend</hi> and <hi>enlarge</hi> the Church into an <hi>universal</hi> Corporation.</p>
               <p>In short therefore Christianity being nothing else but only Judaism <hi>separated</hi> from all those <hi>Appendages</hi> of it, which rendered it <hi>obscure,</hi> and <hi>burthensom,</hi> and <hi>narrow,</hi> it hence follows that that <hi>Remnant</hi> of Jews who <hi>received</hi> and <hi>embraced</hi> it, were so far from <hi>renouncing</hi> their <hi>old</hi> Religion, that they still <hi>admitted,</hi> and <hi>professed,</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered</hi> to it under its greatest <hi>advantages</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements</hi>; that they <hi>renounced</hi> nothing of it but only its comparative <hi>defects,</hi> and did only <hi>admit</hi> of these new <hi>reformations</hi> of it, by which our Saviour advanced it to its utmost <hi>lustre</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> and rendered it infinitely more <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> and <hi>extensive</hi>; and since it was their <hi>old</hi> Religion thus <hi>reformed</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> that they still <hi>embraced</hi> and <hi>continued</hi> in, upon their turning <hi>Christians,</hi> it necessarily follows, that they did not become a <hi>new, distinct</hi> Church, but were only a <hi>continued</hi> succession of the <hi>Old</hi> one. And hence it is that Christians in the New Testament are sometimes called <hi>Iews,</hi> Rev. 2.9. <hi>i. e. reformed</hi> Jews, or, which is the same, <hi>true</hi> Christians; and sometimes the <hi>Israel of God,</hi> Gal. 6.16. and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>the Children of Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3.7. and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>a chosen generation, a Royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people,</hi> which is the proper Character of the <hi>Iews,</hi> because by their <hi>Faith</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:58668:148"/>
and <hi>Religion,</hi> which is nothing but the <hi>true spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> and <hi>mystick</hi> Judaism, they were <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> and <hi>the Children of Abraham,</hi> though they were not <hi>all</hi> so according to the <hi>Flesh,</hi> as the Apostle distinguishes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18. and hence also it is that the Christian Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>new Ierusalem,</hi> Rev. 3.12. because it is nothing but the <hi>Old Ierusalem</hi> or Jewish Church <hi>renewed</hi> and <hi>enlarged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly and lastly, That to this <hi>individual</hi> Church or Kingdom of Christ, thus <hi>reformed</hi> and <hi>improved,</hi> was <hi>superadded</hi> all those <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were <hi>afterwards</hi> converted to Christianity. When the <hi>main</hi> body of the Jews had <hi>rejected</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, his Kingdom was reduced to a very <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> compass, and consisted only of one <hi>single</hi> Congregation of Christians in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which, through the blessing of God upon the <hi>indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable</hi> industry of his <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Disciples,</hi> was by degrees <hi>spread</hi> and <hi>dilated</hi> over all the World. For this <hi>single</hi> Congregation was the Primitive <hi>root</hi> out of which the vast <hi>stock</hi> of the Catholick Church <hi>sprung,</hi> which hath since <hi>branch'd</hi> forth it self into <hi>particular</hi> Churches to all the ends of the Earth; for it is of <hi>this</hi> Church that the Apostle speaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47. when he tells us, that <hi>the Lord added to the Church daily such as should be saved.</hi> So that all that were <hi>converted</hi> to the faith of Christ were but so many <hi>additions</hi> to this <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, so many <hi>living stones</hi> incorporated into this <hi>spiritual building,</hi> which by the industry of its <hi>builders</hi> did soon <hi>encrease</hi> and <hi>multiply</hi> into several <hi>other</hi> Congregations;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:58668:148"/>
and these Congregations, though they were <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> yet were not <hi>separate</hi> or <hi>independent,</hi> but continued all of them <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>first,</hi> as Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous <hi>parts</hi> growing out of the same <hi>body,</hi> or distinct <hi>Apartments</hi> superadded to the same <hi>build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> So that the Christian Church <hi>began</hi> in <hi>one</hi> Congregation, and by degrees <hi>enlarged</hi> it self, like a <hi>fruitful</hi> stock, by <hi>branching</hi> forth it self into <hi>other</hi> Congregations in a continued <hi>unity</hi> with its <hi>own</hi> body, which for the convenience of <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> were afterwards formed into <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> (though not <hi>separate</hi>) particular Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of their particular <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Governours.</hi> And thus all the particular Churches that are now in the World are only so many <hi>Lines</hi> drawn from this Primitive <hi>Centre,</hi> and <hi>united</hi> in it; and it is upon this account particularly that they all of them constitute but <hi>one</hi> Catholick Church, because they all grew out of <hi>one,</hi> and so are but <hi>comparts</hi> of the same <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>branches</hi> of the same <hi>root,</hi> and are only that <hi>one</hi> Primitive Church <hi>multiplied</hi> into several Churches living in the same Catholick <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Vnity.</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Gentile Converts are said to be <hi>graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> into the Jewish Church, which the Apostle calls the <hi>good Olive tree</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17, 18 <hi>For if some of the branches,</hi> that is, the unbelieving Jews, <hi>be broken off, i. e.</hi> rejected from being any more the Church and People of God, <hi>and thou being a wild Olive Tree,</hi> growing in the wild common of the World without the Pale and Inclosure of God's Church, <hi>wert grafted in among them, i. e.</hi> incorporated with the believing Jews, and made a member of the body of their Church, <hi>and with

them partakest of the root and fatness of the Olive Tree, i. e.</hi> communicatest with them in all the blessings of God's Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is the foundation of their Church, <hi>boast not against the branches, but if thou boast,</hi> consider <hi>thou bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not the root, but the root thee, i. e.</hi> the Jewish Church grew not out of <hi>thee,</hi> but <hi>thou</hi> out of <hi>that; she</hi> is no branch of <hi>thee,</hi> but <hi>thou</hi> of <hi>her,</hi> as being ingrafted into <hi>her</hi> Stock, and added to <hi>her</hi> Communion. By which it is evident that the <hi>converted</hi> Gentiles were all but so many <hi>superad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> to that <hi>Primitive</hi> Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was the only <hi>remainder</hi> of the <hi>ancient</hi> Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Church, and which from one <hi>single</hi> Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did by degrees <hi>increase</hi> and <hi>multiply</hi> it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an <hi>infinite</hi> number of <hi>particular</hi> Churches in <hi>Vnion</hi> with <hi>it self</hi> from one end of the World to the other.</p>
               <p>And this, in short, is the <hi>Progress</hi> of Christ's <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>all</hi> such as were <hi>true Worshippers</hi> of God of whatsoever <hi>Kindred</hi> or <hi>Nation</hi>; from <hi>Abraham</hi> to Jesus Christ <hi>principally</hi> of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation; and when the <hi>greatest</hi> part of that Nation had <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted</hi> from Christ, and renounced their relation to him, his Kingdom extended no farther than to the <hi>small</hi> Remnant of the Jews that <hi>adhered</hi> to him, who made up but one <hi>single</hi> Congregation, which Congregation by the <hi>diligence</hi> of its Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and the <hi>blessing</hi> of God <hi>increased</hi> and <hi>propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated</hi> from it self <hi>vast</hi> numbers of <hi>other</hi> Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and these were formed into <hi>particular</hi> Churches, which like so many conquered <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> were still <hi>united</hi> to that Primitive <hi>Kingdom,</hi>

               <head>SECT. VIII. Of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of Christ's Kingdom.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ and the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ are phrases of a <hi>promiscuous</hi> use in holy Scripture, and do import the same thing. Thus <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18, 19. <hi>Thou art Peter, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Rock will I build my Church, and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> where the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> are the same thing. And thus to be <hi>translated into the Kingdom of Christ,</hi> Col. 1.13. and <hi>called to the Kingdom of Christ,</hi> 1 Thess. 2.12. imports no more than to be made a <hi>member</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ. And thus also by <hi>the Kingdom,</hi> Matt. 13.38. by <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> Matth. 21.31. by <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matt. 11.12. and by <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ,</hi> Rev. 11.15. no other thing can be intended but only the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ.</p>
               <p>I confess the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ taken in the <hi>largest</hi> sence extends a great deal <hi>farther</hi> than the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ. For under God the Father he is <hi>universal</hi> Lord and King of the <hi>World,</hi> his <hi>Kingly</hi> power being upon his <hi>Ascension</hi> into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven extended, as was shewn before, to the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> limits of the <hi>Vniverse.</hi> For so he himself tells us by way of Anticipation, that God hath
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:58668:150"/>
                  <hi>given him power over all flesh,</hi> John 17.2. <hi>i. e.</hi> over all <hi>mankind.</hi> For his <hi>Regal</hi> power extends as far as his power of <hi>judging</hi> which is one of the principal <hi>Acts</hi> of his Regality, and his power of judging is over <hi>all mankind</hi>; for so we are assured that God <hi>hath appointed a day in which he will judge the World by the man Christ Iesus,</hi> Acts 17.31. and that Christ is <hi>ordained of God to be the Iudge of quick and dead,</hi> Acts 10.42. and not only so, but that when he shall <hi>sit down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the throne of his glory all Nations shall be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before him, Matth.</hi> 25.31, 32. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the right of his <hi>Royalty</hi> he shall <hi>judge</hi> all <hi>Nations,</hi> it necessarily follows, that <hi>all Nations</hi> are under his <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi>; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Apostle tells us, that God hath <hi>set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this world, but also in that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the Church,</hi> Eph. 1.20, 21, 22. So that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ in a <hi>large</hi> sence extends to <hi>all Nations</hi> in the World, even to the <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> that never heard of his name, and upon this account he is stiled, <hi>The blessed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.15. and so also <hi>Rev.</hi> 17 14.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Church</hi> is more <hi>peculiarly</hi> his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as consisting of <hi>that</hi> part of the World which <hi>owns</hi> and <hi>acknowledges</hi> his <hi>authority,</hi> makes a <hi>visible</hi> profession of <hi>fealty</hi> to him, and <hi>submission</hi> to his Laws and Regulations. As for the <hi>other</hi> parts
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58668:150"/>
of the World, they are all <hi>of right</hi> his <hi>Subjects,</hi> by vertue of that <hi>Vniversal Regal</hi> Authority wherewith the most High God and Father of all things hath <hi>invested</hi> him, but <hi>de facto</hi> they are <hi>Slaves</hi> to the <hi>Prince of darkness,</hi> all whose <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World are nothing but <hi>usurpations</hi> on the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ. But the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>that</hi> part of the World that hath <hi>thrown off</hi> the <hi>yoke</hi> of this <hi>Vsurper,</hi> and by a <hi>solemn</hi> Profession <hi>surrende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> up it self to the <hi>Authority</hi> of Christ its <hi>rightful</hi> Lord and Sovereign; and hence the Members of the Church are said to be <hi>translated out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkness into the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ,</hi> Col. 1.13.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church</hi> therefore being more <hi>peculiarly</hi> Christ's Kingdom, as being that part of the World which is <hi>actually</hi> subjected to him, and under his Government, I shall, with as much brevity as the Argument will admit, inquire into the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>constitution</hi> of it. In general therefore the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ may be thus defined: It is <hi>the one universal society of all Christian People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated by the new Covenant in Baptism under Iesus Christ its supreme head, and distributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lawful Governours and Pastors into particular Churches holding Communion with each other in all the Essentials of Christian Faith, and Worship and Discipline.</hi> For our better understanding of which definition it will be necessary to explain the several parts of it.</p>
               <p>First Therefore it is <hi>the one universal Society of all Christian People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Of all Christian People <hi>incorporated by the New Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:58668:151"/>Thirdly, Of all Christian People incorporated by the New Covenant <hi>in Baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Of all Christian People incorporated <hi>under Iesus Christ its supreme Head and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is a Society of all Christian People <hi>distributed into particular Churches.</hi>

               <p>Sixthly, It is distributed into particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es <hi>under lawful Pastors and Governours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, It is distributed into particular Churches <hi>holding Communion with each other.</hi>

                  </gap>r is,</p>
               <p>First, In all the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christian <hi>Faith</hi>; and</p>
               <p>Secondly, In all the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christian <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In all the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christian <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ is <hi>one universal Society</hi> consisting of all Christian People, who, as was shewn before, were at <hi>first</hi> comprised in one <hi>single</hi> Congregation at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> this single Congregation was the <hi>whole Church</hi> or <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ, which by the continual accession of <hi>new</hi> Converts, <hi>increased</hi> and <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi> by degrees, till <hi>at length</hi> it was <hi>spread</hi> over the whole Earth. So that the Christian Society as it is <hi>now enlarged</hi> is nothing but that <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Church <hi>diffused</hi> and <hi>dilated.</hi> For it was not diffused into <hi>separate</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, but into <hi>similar</hi> parts and members of the <hi>same</hi> Society, and therefore as a man is <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> person when he is <hi>full grown,</hi> as he was when
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:58668:151"/>
he was an <hi>Infant</hi> but of a <hi>span long,</hi> because his growth consists not in an addition of other <hi>persons</hi> to him, but only of other <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; so the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ is the same <hi>individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Church <hi>now,</hi> since it is grown to this <hi>vast</hi> Bulk and Proportion, that it was in its <hi>infant</hi> state, when it extended no farther than one <hi>single</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>egation, because it grew not into other <hi>divided</hi> Churches, but only into other distinct <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> Church; and therefore since its growth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted only in new accessions of <hi>similar</hi> parts to the <hi>same</hi> body, it must be as much <hi>one</hi> Body or Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>now,</hi> as it was at <hi>first,</hi> when it was but one <hi>single</hi> Congregation. For this Congregation was the <hi>root</hi> out of which the Catholick Church <hi>sprang,</hi> or, as our Saviour phrases it, <hi>the grain of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard-seed,</hi> which, though a very <hi>small</hi> seed, shot up into a <hi>mighty</hi> tree, in whose <hi>far-spread</hi> branches the Birds of the Air came and lodged; and therefore as the <hi>stock</hi> and <hi>branches</hi> grow up from the <hi>root</hi> in a continued <hi>Vnion</hi> with it, and <hi>all together</hi> make but <hi>one</hi> Tree, so all the <hi>Christian People</hi> in the World <hi>sprang</hi> out of this <hi>single</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and as they sprang were still <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated</hi> and <hi>united</hi> to it, so as that <hi>all together</hi> they make but <hi>one</hi> Church. And this is that which in our Creeds is called <hi>the holy Catholick</hi> or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal <hi>Church.</hi> For so the Apostle tells us, that there is but <hi>one body,</hi> or Church, as well as <hi>one Spirit, one Lord, one Faith, and one Baptism,</hi> Eph. 4.5, 6. and our Saviour tells us, <hi>Other sheep have I,</hi> meaning the <hi>Gentiles, which are not of this fold,</hi> meaning the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, <hi>and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:58668:152"/>
and one shepherd,</hi> John 10.16. For so the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> added to the <hi>Christian Iewish</hi> Church, are said <hi>of twain to make one new man,</hi> Eph. 2.13. and both together are compared to <hi>a building fitly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med together, growing into an holy Temple in the Lord,</hi> Ibid. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. And indeed since <hi>all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do enjoy <hi>in common,</hi> and without any <hi>distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> the same <hi>priviledges</hi> and <hi>immunities,</hi> they must of necessity be <hi>all</hi> of the same <hi>Community.</hi> For it is by thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

are <hi>met</hi> together in their <hi>Common Halls,</hi> but do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>continue</hi> united after they are <hi>dispersed</hi> abroad to their several homes, because that which unites them is not their being together in the same <hi>place,</hi> but their being obliged together under the same <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>stipulations,</hi> and communicating with one another in the <hi>duties</hi> and <hi>priviledges</hi> of one and the same <hi>Charter</hi>; by reason whereof though they suffer a <hi>continual</hi> defluence of <hi>old</hi> and access of <hi>new</hi> parts, yet still they remain the same <hi>Societies,</hi> (even like <hi>natural</hi> bodies that are under a <hi>perpetual</hi> flux of parts) because they still retain the same <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Charters</hi> which are the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For hence in Scripture it is called <hi>a Kingdom, a City,</hi> or <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a natural <hi>Organized</hi> body, to denote that it is a <hi>Regular</hi> Society, all whose parts are <hi>united</hi> together by legal <hi>bonds</hi> and <hi>ligaments.</hi> Now the legal bond which <hi>unites</hi> the Church, and renders <hi>all</hi> its Members <hi>one</hi> regular Corporation, is the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> by which all Christian People are in <hi>one</hi> body <hi>obliged</hi> to all the <hi>duties</hi> it requires, and <hi>entitled</hi> to all the <hi>Priviledges</hi> it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and by being all <hi>engaged</hi> together in this one <hi>Covenant,</hi> whereby they are all <hi>concerned</hi> together in the same common <hi>duties</hi> and <hi>priviledges,</hi> they are all <hi>incorporate</hi> together into the same <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> And thus it was that the <hi>Iewish</hi> People were all <hi>united</hi> into <hi>one</hi> Church, by their being all <hi>confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated</hi> as one party in one and the same <hi>Covenant,</hi>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58668:155"/>
must be, First, a <hi>solemn</hi> profession of our <hi>belief,</hi> that as we are <hi>buried</hi> under water and <hi>raised</hi> up again, so Christ <hi>died,</hi> and was <hi>buried,</hi> and <hi>raised</hi> up from the dead, which being the <hi>principal</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Christianity do <hi>include</hi> all the rest. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, They also <hi>import</hi> a solemn <hi>engagement</hi> of the Party <hi>baptized</hi> to <hi>die to,</hi> and endeavour ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to <hi>extinguish</hi> all his <hi>sinful</hi> lusts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, even as Christ <hi>died</hi> and was <hi>buried,</hi> and to <hi>rise</hi> from the <hi>spiritual</hi> death of <hi>sin</hi> into <hi>newness</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> even as Christ <hi>rose</hi> from his <hi>natural</hi> death to <hi>live</hi> for ever. Since therefore in their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism they did by the <hi>same</hi> actions signifie their <hi>belief</hi> of the <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Burial,</hi> and <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ, together with their own <hi>resolution</hi> of <hi>dying</hi> to <hi>sin,</hi> and <hi>rising</hi> to <hi>righteousness,</hi> they might very well be said to <hi>dye with Christ</hi> in those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be <hi>buried with Christ,</hi> and to <hi>rise with Christ,</hi> since what is <hi>represented</hi> as done toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>is</hi> representatively done together, and it is usual in Sacraments to call the representing <hi>signs</hi> by the names of the <hi>things</hi> which they represent. For so the <hi>Paschal Lamb</hi> is called the <hi>Passover,</hi> and the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the Lord's Supper the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of Christ; and for the same reason the <hi>plunging</hi> under water and <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> up again in Baptism is here called <hi>dying with Christ,</hi> and <hi>rising with Christ,</hi> because in the <hi>same</hi> actions Christ's <hi>natural</hi> Death and Resurrection and our <hi>spiritual</hi> Death and Resurrection are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented</hi> together. The meaning therefore of the above cited passage is plainly this,
<q>You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant that when you were baptized into Jesus Christ you made a solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58668:155"/>
that you would conform your selves to his Death in dying to sin even as he died for it, so that in your Baptismal immersion you were representatively buried with him, that so as Christ was raised from the dead, so you in conformity thereto might live a new regenerate life; for if we conform to his Death in dying to sin, as we promised to do in our immersion, we shall be sure to conform to his Resurrection also in living to Righteousness, as we promised to do in our rising out of the water again.</q>
By which it is evident that Baptism is on <hi>our</hi> part a solemn <hi>engagement</hi> of our selves to perform the <hi>conditions</hi> of the New Covenant. And indeed the very phrase <hi>Baptized into Iesus Christ</hi> can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no less than a solemn <hi>resignation</hi> of our selves to <hi>Christ</hi> in Baptism. For so the phrase <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into Moses,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.2. plainly denotes the Jews <hi>giving up</hi> themselves to him, to be <hi>governed</hi> by him, as the <hi>Minister</hi> of God. And accordingly the Apostle tells us, that <hi>so many as have been Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Christ have put on Christ,</hi> Gal. 3.27. and <hi>putting on Christ</hi> is opposed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to <hi>making no provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof,</hi> Rom. 13.14. and therefore must necessarily denote an <hi>ingagement</hi> of our selves to a <hi>strict</hi> observance of the <hi>Laws</hi> of Christian <hi>purity</hi>; or, which is the same thing, a <hi>promise</hi> or <hi>stipulation,</hi> on <hi>our</hi> part, of <hi>universal</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>his</hi> Laws. By all which it is evident that in this solemnity of Baptism we put our selves <hi>under</hi> Christ, as our <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with him to be <hi>ruled</hi> by him in our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:58668:156"/>And as in this Ceremony of Initiation <hi>we</hi> strike Covenant with <hi>him,</hi> so doth <hi>he</hi> with <hi>us.</hi> For in this sacred Action the <hi>Minister</hi> is the <hi>authorized Proxy</hi> of Jesus Christ, and therefore <hi>his</hi> giving the holy <hi>Sign</hi> is Christ's <hi>own</hi> action, and doth to all intents and purposes as much oblige him, as if <hi>he</hi> did it in his <hi>own</hi> Person. For since Christ is not upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and so cannot <hi>transact</hi> the New Covenant with us in his own Person, it is necessary he should do it by Authorized Proxies, <hi>impowered</hi> by himself to do it in <hi>his Name</hi>; which Proxies being thus Authorized by him, do as <hi>effectually</hi> oblige <hi>him</hi> by those <hi>federal</hi> Rites which they perform in <hi>his</hi> Name, as if he <hi>himself</hi> had performed them in his own <hi>Person.</hi> For <hi>he</hi> doth what <hi>they</hi> do by <hi>his</hi> Authority, and is as effectually <hi>obliged</hi> by what he doth by them <hi>mediately,</hi> as by what he doth by himself <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</hi> For thus his <hi>Commission</hi> runs, by which he Authorized <hi>them</hi> and their <hi>Successors</hi> to the end of the World, <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost</hi>; where that Phrase, <hi>in the Name,</hi> plainly imports (as it generally doth in other places of Scripture) <hi>by the Authority.</hi> So that by this Commission Christ's Ministers are <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi> and <hi>constituted</hi> the <hi>legal</hi> Proxies of the <hi>holy Trinity,</hi> in the <hi>stead</hi> of those blessed Persons to <hi>seal</hi> the <hi>New Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Baptismal sign</hi> to those whom they baptize, and thereby <hi>legally</hi> to <hi>oblige</hi> the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost</hi> to perform the <hi>Promises</hi> of it to all those Baptized persons who perform the <hi>conditions</hi> of it. For that the Baptismal sign is a <hi>legal</hi> ingagement upon <hi>God</hi> as
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58668:156"/>
well as <hi>us</hi> to perform the New Covenant, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believes and is baptized shall be saved</hi>; where it is evident, that <hi>Baptism</hi> as well as <hi>Faith</hi> doth confer a <hi>right</hi> to Salvation; and therefore since <hi>Faith</hi> confers it only as it is the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Covenant, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> must confer it as it is the <hi>Seal</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And accordingly <hi>S. Peter</hi> exhorts his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts <hi>to repent and be baptized for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost</hi>; from whence it is evident, that <hi>Baptism</hi> as well as <hi>Repentance</hi> has a great influence on our <hi>remission of sins,</hi> and our <hi>communication</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Since therefore <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are the <hi>whole</hi> condition of the <hi>promise</hi> of remission, and of the Holy Ghost, it necessarily follows, that <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> doth not influence it as it is the <hi>Condition,</hi> but as it is the <hi>Seal</hi> of the <hi>Promise.</hi> And so also in Baptism we are said to <hi>wash away our sins, i. e.</hi> the <hi>guilt</hi> of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. because the sign of Baptism <hi>seals</hi> to us on <hi>God's</hi> part the <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>Forgiveness.</hi> By all which it is evident, that Baptism is a <hi>federal Rite</hi> in which <hi>God</hi> and <hi>we</hi> do <hi>seal</hi> and <hi>ratifie</hi> to one another each others <hi>part</hi> of the New Covenant; and it is this <hi>sealing</hi> that makes the Covenant <hi>obliging</hi> to <hi>both</hi> Parties, and gives to <hi>each</hi> a legal <hi>Claim</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to each others <hi>promise</hi> and <hi>engagement</hi>; to <hi>God</hi> it gives a legal Title to all that <hi>duty</hi> which <hi>we</hi> promise, and to <hi>us</hi> it gives a legal Title to all those <hi>blessings</hi> which <hi>God</hi> promises. So that till such time as we are <hi>Baptized,</hi> the <hi>New Covenant</hi> is not <hi>struck</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> nor have we any <hi>right</hi> or <hi>title</hi> to any of the blessings <hi>promised</hi> in it. And
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58668:157"/>
though we should <hi>perform</hi> all that <hi>duty</hi> which the Covenant <hi>requires,</hi> yet this will not at all <hi>intitle</hi> us to the <hi>blessings</hi> it <hi>promises.</hi> For he who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages to walk a <hi>Mile</hi> for me upon my <hi>promise</hi> to give him a <hi>thousand pounds,</hi> hath upon his <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi> a just <hi>claim</hi> and <hi>title</hi> to the <hi>whole</hi> Sum; whereas he that walks <hi>ten</hi> Miles for me <hi>without</hi> any such promise, hath a <hi>right</hi> to no <hi>more</hi> than what in <hi>strict</hi> justice he <hi>deserves.</hi> And therefore since what God <hi>promises</hi> in the New Covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>exceeds</hi> the <hi>merit</hi> of what he <hi>requires,</hi> our <hi>performance</hi> of what he requires doth not at all <hi>oblige</hi> him to <hi>bestow</hi> the <hi>blessings</hi> of his promise on us, unless we perform it upon a <hi>Covenant-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement</hi>; and therefore till this engagement is <hi>made</hi> and <hi>sealed</hi> in our <hi>Baptism,</hi> we can have no <hi>promise</hi> to rely upon; and though we should nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For our admission into this <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which is the Churches <hi>Charter,</hi> is our admission into the <hi>Church</hi> it self; and it is by being <hi>intituled</hi> to all the <hi>blessings</hi> that belong to Christians <hi>in common,</hi> by vertue of the New Covenant, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Members</hi> of the Christian <hi>Community.</hi> And hence we are said to be <hi>Baptized into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> or Church of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. because Baptism, which is our admission into the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Covenant,</hi> is only in other words our admission into the Christian <hi>Church,</hi> which is nothing but the <hi>Body</hi> of Christian People <hi>joyned</hi> and <hi>confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> by the <hi>New Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Church or Kingdom of Christ is one universal Society of all Christian People incorporated by the New Covenant in Baptism <hi>under Iesus Christ its supreme head.</hi> And it is this also that makes all Christian People one <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Society,</hi> because they are all united under one and the same supreme <hi>head</hi> and <hi>Governour.</hi> For as <hi>several</hi> neighbouring Congregations are called in Scripture <hi>one</hi> Church, as I shall shew hereafter; because they were all under the Government of <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> Bishop; so <hi>all</hi> the Churches under <hi>all</hi> the Bishops in the World are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called <hi>one</hi> Church, because they are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>one</hi> Governour, even <hi>Iesus</hi> Christ the <hi>supreme</hi> Bishop of our souls: And accordingly the Apostle tells us, that as there is but <hi>one body, i. e.</hi> one Church, so there is but <hi>one Lord</hi> or supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:58668:158"/>
of that Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4, 5. and in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. he tells us, that Christ <hi>is the head of this body the Church</hi>; and again, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. that <hi>the Husband is the head of the Wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church.</hi> For Christ being Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> by which we are <hi>incorporated</hi> into a Religious Society, it must be under <hi>him,</hi> as our immediate head and Governour, that we are incorporate by it; because as he is Mediator of it for God, his <hi>Office</hi> is to govern us <hi>for</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> God, according to the terms and conditions of it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Church or Kingdom of Christ is <hi>one universal Society</hi> of all Christian People [di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed into particular Churches] which distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution is made for the <hi>convenience</hi> of divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the Catholick Church being a vast Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy composed of <hi>infinite parts</hi> which are separated from each other by vast distances of place, it is impossible for it to celebrate the Offices of Divine Worship in any <hi>one Assembly</hi> or <hi>Congregation.</hi> At first indeed the <hi>whole Catholick Church</hi> was only a <hi>single Congregation</hi>; but this in a little time encreased and multiplied so fast, that they could no longer exercise the Publick Worship of God together in <hi>one place</hi> or <hi>Assembly</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first distribution of it was into several Congregations which in Scripture are called by the name of <hi>Churches,</hi> as being similar parts of the Catholick Church, even as <hi>every breath</hi> of Air is called <hi>Air,</hi> and <hi>every drop</hi> of water, <hi>water.</hi> For thus those Believers who were wont to assemble in any <hi>one particular</hi> house to worship God toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are frequently called <hi>Churches:</hi> as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:58668:158"/>
                  <hi>the Church in the house of Priscilla and Aquila,</hi> Rom. 16.5. <hi>The Church in the house of Nymphas,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.19. <hi>The Church in the house of Philemon,</hi> Col. 4.15. In which houses in all probability there was an <hi>upper Room</hi> Consecrated and set apart according to the Custom of the Jews for divine Worship, in which <hi>upper Rooms</hi> not only the Believers of the <hi>Family,</hi> but several other <hi>neighbouring</hi> Christians were wont to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble for the publick exercise of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. And so where ever the Scripture speaks of several Churches in the same Country; as for instances, <hi>the Churches of Iudea,</hi> Gal. 1.22. <hi>of Samaria and Galile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> Acts 9.31. it is evident, that by these Churches no more is meant but only the <hi>several Congregations</hi> of Believers in those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But these Congregations growing numerous, there was a <hi>second distribution</hi> made of them, by which many of those <hi>Congregations neighbouring</hi> upon one another, were collected into <hi>one body,</hi> under <hi>one head</hi> or <hi>Bishop,</hi> who was the <hi>common guide</hi> and <hi>Pastor</hi> of all the Members, whether Lay or Clergy, appertaining to them. And these Collections of several Congregations under their several Bishops or Governours, are in Scripture also frequently called <hi>Churches</hi>; for thus for instance, the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> contained in it several <hi>Congregations,</hi> and therefore though in the Dedication of his Epistle the Apostle calls it, <hi>the Church of God,</hi> in the singular number, <hi>which is at Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. yet in the Epistle he enjoyns, that <hi>the women should keep silence in the Churches,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is a plain
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58668:159"/>
Evidence, that in that Church there were several <hi>Churches</hi> or <hi>Congregations</hi>; and so also we read of the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Syria, Cilicia,</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> all which were large Countries; and did without doubt contain in them <hi>several Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi> of Christians; and thus also we read of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the singular number, and so of <hi>Antioch, Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now as the <hi>first distribution</hi> of the Catholick Church into distinct Congregations was made for the <hi>convenience of Worship,</hi> it being impossible for the whole Church, when it began to encrease and enlarge it self, to celebrate the divine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices by the Ministry of one and the same Pastor; so this <hi>second d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>stribution</hi> of it into particular Churches, consisting of several Congregations, was made for the <hi>convenience of Government</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi>; it being impossible for the whole Church to maintain its Order, Government, and Discipline, under the single inspection of any <hi>one Bishop</hi> or <hi>Governour:</hi> But yet notwithstanding th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:58668:159"/>
Congregations, and those into several particular Churches or Episcopacies; because they are all incorporate under <hi>one spiritual Head,</hi> even Jesus Christ the supreme Bishop and Pastor of our Souls.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It is the <hi>universal Society</hi> of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian People distributed into particular Churches under <hi>lawful</hi> Governours and Pastors, and it is this indeed that constitutes them <hi>distinct</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, <hi>viz.</hi> their being <hi>joyned</hi> and <hi>united</hi> together under <hi>distinct</hi> Pastors and Governours: For thus a <hi>single</hi> Congregation is a <hi>distinct Church,</hi> because all the Members of it do locally <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate</hi> together in all the Offices of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship administred to them by a <hi>distinct Pastor</hi>; and so also a Collection of several Congregations is a <hi>distinct Church,</hi> because they all <hi>participate</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the direction and conduct of a <hi>distinct Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</hi> For, as I shewed before, the reason of these distributions of the Catholick Church first into single Congregations, was the <hi>Convenience</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> and then into several Collections of several Congregations was the <hi>Convenience</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>; and therefore since that which serves the convenience of <hi>Worship</hi> is the having <hi>distinct Pastors</hi> to administer it, and that which serves the convenience of <hi>Government</hi> is the having <hi>distinct Rulers</hi> to exercise it, it hence necessarily follows, that that which makes a Congregation a distinct <hi>distribution</hi> of the Catholick Church, must be its <hi>worshipping</hi> together under a <hi>distinct Pastor</hi>; and that which makes a Collection of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations a distinct distribution of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, must be its being united together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a distinct <hi>Governour</hi>; because without their
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58668:160"/>
                  <hi>Pastor</hi> or their <hi>Governour</hi> they want the formal reason of their being distributed into <hi>distinct Churches.</hi> And indeed there is no Church what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, whether it be a single Congregation or a Collection of Congregations, can act as a Church without a <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Governour.</hi> No Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can lawfully communicate in the publick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Divine Worship</hi> without a lawful Pastor to administer it: no Collection of Congregations can lawfully exert any act of <hi>Church-Government</hi> without having an authorized <hi>Governour</hi> to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it. For the administration of all Church-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices is committed by our Saviour into the hands of the Churches Officers; it is to them that he hath given <hi>the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, i. e.</hi> Authority to <hi>admit,</hi> or <hi>exclude,</hi> or <hi>readmit</hi> men into the Communion of the Church: It is they alone whom he hath made the Keepers of the <hi>Seals</hi> of the New Covenant, <hi>viz. Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>; they alone whom he hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to <hi>teach</hi> the Gospel, to <hi>bless</hi> the People, and to <hi>offer</hi> up the Publick Prayers of Christian Assemblies. And these are the <hi>proper</hi> acts of a Church considered <hi>as a Church</hi>; so that without Pastors or Governours there is no Church can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any of those acts that are <hi>proper</hi> to a Church: and therefore since all <hi>action</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Essence</hi> of the Agent; <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Governours,</hi> without which Churches as such cannot act, must necessarily be <hi>essential</hi> to Churches: and hence the Apostle tells us, that the great purpose for which Christ ordained Apostles, Prophets, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, and Pastors, and Teachers was, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for the compacting or joyning together the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:58668:160"/>
Saints</hi> as one body in Church-Communion and Society, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. and hence also you find the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> following the number of the <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Rulers</hi> of them; <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. which plainly implies, that therefore they were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven distinct <hi>Churches,</hi> because they had seven distinct <hi>Rulers</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi>; and therefore though the Ordination of Pastors and Bishops is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sined to the Ministry of any particular Church, but extends to the Ministry of the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, for so <hi>S. Paul, Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, all are yours, and you are Christ's,</hi> that is, they are <hi>all</hi> Ministers of the Catholick Church <hi>in common,</hi> of which you are Members, and as such you have <hi>all</hi> a share in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. yet it is the particular application of this their <hi>general capacity</hi> to this or that <hi>particular number</hi> of Christians or Congregations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that constitutes them <hi>particular Churches</hi>; and being first authorized Ministers of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, they carry along with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the particular Church they are sent to, all that <hi>Church-Authority</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> by which it acts and operates <hi>as a Church:</hi> So that without <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Governours</hi> particular <hi>Churches</hi> are nothing but so many <hi>Bodies</hi> without <hi>Souls,</hi> to animate and act them; and therefore as in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies the <hi>form</hi> that acts them doth also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute their <hi>Kind</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> so in these Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical <hi>Bodies</hi> the <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Governours,</hi> that move and act them as Churches, do also constitute them <hi>Churches.</hi> What these <hi>lawful Pastors</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> are, I shall have occasion to discourse hereafter, when I come to treat of the <hi>Ministers</hi> of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:58668:161"/>
                  <hi>Christ's Kingdom</hi>; it being sufficient at present to shew the <hi>necessity</hi> of them to the constituting particular Churches.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The Church is one <hi>universal Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>all</hi> Christian People distributed into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches [holding Communion with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther] by holding Communion with each other, I mean, <hi>owning</hi> each other as <hi>parts</hi> of the same body, and <hi>admitting</hi> each others Members, as occasion serves, into <hi>actual Communion</hi> with them in all their Religious Offices. It is true, in the Primitive Churches there were sundry <hi>pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> acts of Communion pass'd between them, such as their <hi>formed</hi> and <hi>communicatory Letters,</hi> by which the holy Bishops gave an account to each other of the <hi>state</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Churches, and consulted each others <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> about them; but these were not at all <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to that Communion which they were obliged, as true Churches, to maintain with one another. All the Communion which they are obliged to, as they are <hi>similar parts</hi> and <hi>distributions</hi> of the Catholick Church, is that they should not <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide</hi> into separate Churches, so as to <hi>exclude</hi> each others Members from Communicating in each others Worship, when ever they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to travel from one Church to another. For so long as there is no <hi>Rupture</hi> between distant Churches, no declared <hi>disowning</hi> of each other, no express <hi>refusal</hi> of any act of Communion to each others Members, they may be truly said to maintain all <hi>necessary</hi> Communion with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And that this Communion is <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> between all those particular Churches
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58668:161"/>
into which the Catholick Church is distributed will evidently appear from these four considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. First, that by <hi>Baptism,</hi> as was shewed before, all Christian People are made <hi>Members</hi> of the Catholick Church, and by being made <hi>Members</hi> of it they are all obliged to <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with</hi> it; for how can they <hi>act</hi> as <hi>parts</hi> of the whole, that hold no <hi>Communication</hi> with the whole? They who are Members of any Society have not only a <hi>Right</hi> to communicate in all the common <hi>Benefits</hi> of it, but also an <hi>Obligation</hi> to communicate in all common <hi>Offices</hi> of it; and therefore since by Baptism we are made <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> or <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> we are thereby not only entituled to partake with it in all its <hi>Priviledges,</hi> but also obliged to joyn with it in all its <hi>Offices.</hi> But then secondly, it is farther to be considered, that the Catholick Church being all <hi>distributed</hi> into particular Churches, we can no otherwise communicate with <hi>it,</hi> than by communicating with some <hi>particular Church</hi>; for how can we communicate with the <hi>whole,</hi> that is all distributed into <hi>parts,</hi> without communicating with some <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi>? And since the <hi>whole</hi> is nothing but only a <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>parts,</hi> what Communion can they hold with the <hi>whole,</hi> who hold no Communion with any <hi>part</hi> of it? So long therefore as there is any such thing as a <hi>visible</hi> Catholick Church upon Earth, we are obliged by our Baptism, unless <hi>necessity</hi> hinder us, to maintain a <hi>visible Communion</hi> with it; and so long as this Catholick Church is all distributed into so many <hi>particular visible Churches,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not visibly communicate with it, unless we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:58668:162"/>
with some <hi>one</hi> of those <hi>particular</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For how can we be in Communion with the <hi>whole</hi> body, when we are out of Communion with all the <hi>parts,</hi> unless we can find a body to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with without all its parts, or some universal Church without all particular Churches. But then thirdly, it is also to be considered that as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Communicate with the <hi>universal</hi> Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Communicating with some <hi>particular</hi> one, so neither do we Communicate with the <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi> Church by Communicating with any <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> one, unless that particular one be <hi>in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with the Church Universal. For if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not communicate with the <hi>whole</hi> without being in Communion with some <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>whole,</hi> it is impossible I should communicate with the <hi>whole</hi> unless I communicate with some <hi>part</hi> that is <hi>in Communion</hi> with the <hi>whole.</hi> It is as possible for a Finger to <hi>communicate</hi> with a body by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned to an Arm that is <hi>separated</hi> from the body; as it is for a Christian to <hi>Communicate</hi> with the Church Catholick by being <hi>joyned</hi> to a Church that is <hi>separate</hi> from the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick. But then fourthly and lastly, There is no particular Church <hi>can</hi> be <hi>in Communion</hi> with the Catholick, that <hi>separates</hi> it self from the Communion of <hi>any particular</hi> Church that is in Communion with the Catholick. For they who separate from <hi>any part</hi> of <hi>any whole,</hi> must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily separate from the <hi>whole,</hi> because the <hi>whole</hi> is nothing but <hi>all the parts</hi> together; and it is a contradiction to say, that they who are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from any <hi>one part</hi> are yet united to <hi>all.</hi> How then is it possible for <hi>any</hi> Church to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:58668:162"/>
it self from the Communion of <hi>any other</hi> Church, which is a <hi>true part</hi> of the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, without separating it self from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church Catholick <hi>it self</hi>; since the Church Catholick is nothing but a <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>all true</hi> Churches; and to be at the same time <hi>united</hi> to <hi>all</hi> true Churches, and <hi>separated</hi> from <hi>one</hi> true Church, is the same absurdity as to be <hi>separated</hi> from <hi>all</hi> true Churches, and yet <hi>united</hi> to <hi>one.</hi> In short, the Catholick Church is <hi>one,</hi> by the Communion of <hi>all</hi> its <hi>parts,</hi> and therefore they who break Communion with <hi>any one</hi> part must necessarily disunite themselves from the <hi>whole.</hi> For when two Churches separate from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it must be, either because the one <hi>requires</hi> such <hi>terms</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> as are <hi>not Catholick,</hi> or because the other <hi>refuses</hi> such as <hi>are.</hi> Now that Church which requires <hi>sinful</hi> or <hi>uncatholick terms</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> doth thereby exclude not only <hi>one,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> parts of the Catholick Church from its Communion, because they are all equally obliged not to <hi>Communicate</hi> with <hi>any</hi> Church upon <hi>sinful terms</hi> of Communion, and that Church which <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes</hi> all parts of the Catholick Church from its Communion, must in so doing <hi>separate</hi> it self from the Communion of the Catholick Church. And so on the other hand, that Church which <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses</hi> the Communion of any other Church upon <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>Catholick terms,</hi> doth thereby <hi>separate</hi> it self from Communion of all parts of the Church Catholick, because it separates from a part that <hi>is</hi> in <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>all</hi> the <hi>parts</hi> of it; for that Church which may be <hi>lawfully</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with is in Communion with all other
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:58668:163"/>
Churches that are in Communion with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; and therefore that Church which <hi>separates</hi> from its Communion cannot be in the number of those Churches that are <hi>in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with the Catholick Church; and how then can this separating Church be in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Catholick Church, when it is <hi>out</hi> of the Communion of <hi>any one</hi> of those Churches of which the <hi>Catholick Church consists</hi>? All those particular Churches therefore into which the Catholick Church is <hi>distributed,</hi> must be <hi>in Communion</hi> with each other, otherwise they are so far from being <hi>distributions</hi> of the Catholick Church, that they are only so many <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>divisions</hi> from it. For if every Christian is <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> by his Baptism to <hi>Communicate</hi> with the Catholick Church; and if he can no <hi>otherwise</hi> Communicate with it than by Communicating with some <hi>particular</hi> Church, which is in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church Catholick; and lastly, if no particular Church can be in Communion with the Church Catholick which is not in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Churches</hi> of which the Church Catholick <hi>consists</hi>; then it is absolutely necessary that all those Churches into which the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick is distributed should maintain a <hi>Catholick Communion</hi> with one another.</p>
               <p>Eighthly and lastly, The <hi>Communion</hi> which these particular Churches into which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Society of Christians is distributed, <hi>hold</hi> with each other is <hi>threefold:</hi> 1. In <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christian <hi>Faith:</hi> 2.

In all the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christian <hi>Faith</hi>; By the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christian <hi>Faith,</hi> I mean those <hi>Doctrines,</hi> the belief of which is necessary to the <hi>very being</hi> of Christianity; for as in all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> there are some <hi>first Principles</hi> upon which the <hi>whole Scheme</hi> of their Doctrines depends, and the <hi>denial</hi> of which like the removing the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> of a building <hi>dissolves</hi> and <hi>ruines</hi> the whole <hi>structure</hi>; so in Christianity there are some <hi>Principles</hi> so <hi>fundamental</hi> to it, as that the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval</hi> of them <hi>shakes</hi> the whole Scheme of it in pieces. Now the great Fundamental, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle tells us, is Jesus Christ, <hi>for other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Iesus Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. so that by <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> the belief of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> from the Christian Religion, we <hi>necessarily</hi> sink and dissolve the whole structure; and accordingly the Apostle pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces those men <hi>Apostates</hi> from <hi>Christianity</hi> who <hi>hold not the head,</hi> which is Jesus Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. but yet the bare <hi>belief</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> or of this Proposition, that <hi>Christ came from God,</hi> and <hi>was his Messias and Anointed,</hi> is not <hi>all</hi> that is <hi>essential</hi> to the Christian <hi>Faith,</hi> which includes not only his <hi>Mission</hi> from God, but also the <hi>end</hi> of his <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, viz.</hi> to be a <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and Man. For <hi>Christianity,</hi> as it is distinguished from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion,</hi> is nothing but the Religion of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> as consisting wholly of the Doctrine of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> together with the <hi>duties</hi> thence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; so that whatsoever Proposition the <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torship</hi> of Christ necessarily and immediately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, it is a <hi>fundamental</hi> Article of the Christian <hi>Faith,</hi> which no man can deny, without <hi>innovating</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:58668:164"/>
the whole Religion, and turning it into a quite <hi>different</hi> Doctrine from <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real Christianity.</hi> For this Proposition, that <hi>Christ came from God to Mediate between God and Man,</hi> includes the whole Doctrine of the Gospel: and therefore whatsoever Proposition is either so <hi>necessarily included</hi> in it, or so <hi>inseparably conjoyned</hi> with it, as that the <hi>denial</hi> of it doth by necessary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate consequence <hi>overthrow</hi> the <hi>Mediation</hi> of our Saviour, it must be <hi>essential</hi> to the Christian Faith; and the more <hi>necessary</hi> Connection there is between any particular Doctrine, and this <hi>all-comprehending</hi> Doctrine of the Mediation, the more necessary and essential it is to the Christian <hi>Faith.</hi>

               <p>Now whosoever believes not, or at least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies any <hi>Essential part</hi> of the Christian Faith, is not a Christian, and that not only because he wants a part of that Faith which <hi>denominates</hi> men Christians, but also because by disbelieving that part he doth by necessary consequence <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> of Christianity, for so <hi>Tertul. de Praescr. c.</hi> 37. expresly asserts, <hi>Si Haeretici sunt, Christiani esse non possunt, i. e.</hi> they who are Hereticks cannot be Christians; and hence it is that <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who are such as obstinately deny any <hi>fundamental</hi> Article of Christianity, are in Scripture ranked in the same C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if Heresie excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates not only <hi>Heretical Persons,</hi> but <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Societies,</hi> then a common <hi>Agreement</hi> in all the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christian Faith, which is the opposite of <hi>Heresie,</hi> is necessarily included in <hi>Catholick Communion</hi>; and accordingly the Scripture frequently presses all Christian People to this common <hi>agreement,</hi> as to a most <hi>essential</hi> part of their Communion with each other: For so they are required <hi>to mind</hi> or <hi>think one and the same thing,</hi> Phil. 2.2. to <hi>stand fast in one spirit with one mind,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.11. to <hi>walk by the same rule, and think the same thing,</hi> Phil. 1.27. to <hi>be joyned together in the same mind, and in the same judgment,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.10. To <hi>hold fast the form of sound words,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13. to <hi>strive together for the faith of the Gospel,</hi> Phil. 1.27. and to <hi>keep that which is committed to us,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.20. which is <hi>that one form of Doctrine which was delivered to us,</hi> Rom· 6.17. The meaning of all which is not to oblige us to be of <hi>one mind</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:58668:165"/>
in <hi>all</hi> points of Religion; for that is no more in our power than it is to be all of one <hi>stature</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion</hi>; but that we should all unanimously <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> in all those fundamental Articles of which that <hi>one Faith</hi> consists, which is the <hi>common Creed</hi> of Christians: So that it is not the differing of one Church from another in <hi>Doctrines</hi> that are either <hi>remote</hi> from or <hi>near</hi> the foundations of Christianity, that <hi>dissolves</hi> their Communion in the Christian Faith; but so long as the <hi>essential</hi> Doctrines of the Gospel are secured on both sides, no <hi>corrupt Doctrines</hi> on either side can warrant a <hi>breach</hi> of Communion between them. It is true, if the erring Church imposes the belief of its <hi>errors</hi> as a <hi>Condition</hi> of its Communion, no Church or Christian, that believes them to be errors, can <hi>lawfully</hi> Communicate with it, be those errors never so small or inconsiderable; not that in themselves they are a <hi>sufficient</hi> cause of <hi>separation,</hi> but because they who do not believe them cannot profess they do, without telling a <hi>lie,</hi> which is a condition that is <hi>simply unlawful:</hi> And so also when the errors are such as do corrupt the <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> parts of her Worship, so that there is no communicating with her in her <hi>Worship</hi> without communicating in her <hi>corruptions</hi>; all Churches and Christians are obliged to <hi>abstain</hi> from its Communion, not because of the errors simply considered in <hi>themselves,</hi> but because they <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>desecrate</hi> her Worship with those sinful <hi>intermixtures</hi> they infuse into it; so that we cannot joyn with her in her <hi>Worship,</hi> without joyning with her in her <hi>sin:</hi> so that there is <hi>no error</hi> can <hi>separate</hi> any Church or Christian from
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:58668:165"/>
the Catholick Communion of Faith, but only <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,</hi> which is a <hi>perverse</hi> renunciation of some <hi>essential</hi> part or <hi>fundamental</hi> Article of that Faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Communion</hi> which the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, of which the Catholick Church consists, hold with each other is in <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> also of Christian <hi>Worship.</hi> By the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christian <hi>Worship,</hi> I mean the <hi>Invocation</hi> of the one Eternal God through the one Mediator Jesus Christ, and the participation of the two <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> of Baptism and the Lord's Supper. Hence the Apostle tells us, that as there is but <hi>one</hi> common <hi>Faith</hi> wherein all true Christians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with each other, so there is but <hi>one Lord,</hi> Eph. 4.4. and but <hi>one God</hi> for us to address to, and <hi>one Mediator between God and man</hi> for us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress by, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. and therefore to address <hi>to</hi> this <hi>one God by</hi> this <hi>one Mediator,</hi> is an essential part of Christian <hi>Worship.</hi> And the same Apostle tells us, that there is but <hi>one Baptism,</hi> Eph. 4.4. and but <hi>one bread of which we are all partakers,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 17. and therefore to participate of these <hi>Sacraments</hi> must also be <hi>essential</hi> to Christian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; so that all those particular Churches that admit each others Members upon <hi>lawful terms</hi> to communicate with them in worshipping this <hi>one God,</hi> through this <hi>one Mediator,</hi> and in this <hi>one Baptism,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> Eucharistical <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Cup,</hi> are so far in <hi>Communion</hi> with the Church Catholick. For in <hi>these</hi> acts of Christian Worship consists the principal part of Christian Communion, and therefore that Church which <hi>refuses</hi> either to admit other Churches to communicate with her
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:58668:166"/>
in these acts of Worship, or to communicate with them in them upon <hi>lawful</hi> terms, doth so far <hi>separate it self</hi> from the Christian Communion, I say upon lawful terms, because if it either <hi>require</hi> unlawful, or <hi>refuse</hi> lawful ones, it utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excludes all other Churches from its Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. If on the one hand it hath <hi>sophisticated</hi> its <hi>Worship</hi> with any unlawful <hi>intermixtures,</hi> so that there is no participating with her in the <hi>one,</hi> without partaking with her in the <hi>other</hi>; If we cannot pray with her <hi>to</hi> the <hi>one</hi> God <hi>by</hi> the <hi>one</hi> Mediator, without praying <hi>to Creatures</hi> too, or praying <hi>by</hi> other <hi>Mediators</hi> also: If we cannot partake with her in her <hi>Baptism,</hi> without parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with her in some <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>impure Rites</hi> of Baptism: In a word, if we cannot be admitted to receive the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> with her, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it by <hi>halves,</hi> or being obliged to pay di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>homage</hi> to its <hi>Elements</hi>; in this case, I say, all Christians and Christian Churches are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>excluded</hi> by her from communicating with her in the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christian <hi>Worship.</hi> And so on the other hand, if a Church <hi>forbid</hi> its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to <hi>Communicate</hi> upon occasion with any <hi>other</hi> Church in these acts of Christian Worship, upon <hi>lawful</hi> terms, in so doing it divides <hi>it self</hi> from the Communion of the Church Catholick; and though that Church it refuses to communicate with, should through the <hi>neglect</hi> of its <hi>Discipline</hi> have a great many <hi>bad</hi> men as well as <hi>good</hi> in it; though it should require the observation of a great many <hi>indifferent</hi> Rites, Customs, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, yea, and of <hi>contrary</hi> Rites and Customs to its own; yet so long as the <hi>Essentials</hi> of its
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:58668:166"/>
Worship are kept <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>entire,</hi> and are not so blended with unlawful <hi>intermixtures</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that we may <hi>safely</hi> partake of them, without being at all obliged to partake of any <hi>sin</hi>; in this case I say to <hi>refuse</hi> to Communicate with it, is to <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> from the Communion of the Catholick Church. For for the <hi>same</hi> reason that any Church <hi>refuses</hi> to Communicate with <hi>this</hi> Church, it must refuse to Communicate with <hi>all</hi> other Churches in the World, because we cannot to this day, nor ever could Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with any Church in the World in which there was not <hi>some defect</hi> of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, <hi>some intermixture</hi> of bad men with good, and <hi>some indifferent</hi> Modes and Ceremonies of Worship.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and lastly, Another thing wherein those particular Churches into which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church is distributed do communicate with each other, is in the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Regiment</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi>; for though the particular <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Government and Discipline are not <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> by divine Institution, but left for the most part <hi>free</hi> to the prudent ordering and disposal of the Governours of particular Churches; yet there is a <hi>standing form</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> in the Church <hi>instituted</hi> by our Saviour <hi>himself,</hi> which, as I shall shew hereafter, is this, that there should be an <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> or Order of men au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized in a continued <hi>Succession</hi> from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles (who were Authorized by himself) to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> all those particular Churches into
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:58668:167"/>
which the Church Catholick should be hereafter distributed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>Ordain</hi> inferiour Ministers to teach, and instruct, and administer the holy Offices to particular Congregations; and having Ordained them, to <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> them in the discharge of their Functions, to <hi>prescribe</hi> the particular Rules of outward Order and Decency to the People of the respective Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Charge, to <hi>confirm</hi> the weak, and <hi>admonish</hi> the disorderly, and <hi>correct</hi> the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, by excluding them from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of Christ. These things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being all of <hi>divine Institution,</hi> are the <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> of Christian <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> in which all Christian Churches are <hi>obliged</hi> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with each other. And this being the <hi>standing Government</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, no particular Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Christians can <hi>refuse to communicate in it</hi> without dividing it self from the Communion of the Church Catholick; I say, <hi>refuse to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in it,</hi> because it is possible for a Church to be without this Government and Discipline which yet doth neither <hi>refuse</hi> it, nor the Communion of any other Church for the sake of it. A Church may be debarred of it by unavoidable <hi>necessities</hi> in despite of its power, and against its consent, and under this circumstance I can by no means think such a Church to be <hi>separated</hi> from the Church Catholick; it is indeed an <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>defective</hi> part of the Catholick Church, and if this <hi>defect</hi> of it be any way owing to its own <hi>negligence,</hi> it is a very great <hi>fault</hi> in it, as well as an <hi>unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> But though this instituted Government
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:58668:167"/>
is necessary to the <hi>perfection</hi> of a Church, yet it doth not therefore follow that it is necessary to the <hi>being</hi> of it. For even in the Jewish Church, wherein all things were <hi>determined</hi> by <hi>divine institution,</hi> even to the <hi>minutest</hi> Circumstances, there were sundry notorious <hi>deviations</hi> from that Institution, which yet did not <hi>un-church</hi> them. It was a great <hi>deviation</hi> in them to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in their High Places, after God had <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> them to Sacrifice <hi>only</hi> at the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> It was another great <hi>deviation</hi> in them, to make Priests out of <hi>other Families,</hi> after God had <hi>determined</hi> them to the Family of <hi>Aaron</hi>; and yet it is certain, that neither the one nor the other did <hi>un-church</hi> them: And if these deviations from divine Institution, which were the effects of their <hi>negligence,</hi> did not yet <hi>un-church them,</hi> it is not to be imagined that such <hi>deviations</hi> from it as are the pure effects of <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> should <hi>un-church others.</hi> For though no <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> can dispence with the <hi>Eternal Laws</hi> of good and evil, because the observance of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly upon our <hi>Wills,</hi> and there is no such necessity <hi>can</hi> happen to us, as can put them out of the power of a <hi>willing</hi> mind, yet as for <hi>positive Institutions,</hi> there are a thousand <hi>necessities</hi> may occur, any one of which may render them wholly <hi>unpracticable,</hi> and then no man can be <hi>obliged</hi> to do that which is <hi>impossible</hi>; as for instance, the whole Family of <hi>Aaron</hi> might have been extinct, and if it had, it is evident that <hi>positive institution</hi> by which God required the Jews to chuse their Priests out of the Family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> must have been wholly <hi>unpracticable,</hi> and consequently the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58668:168"/>
                  <hi>Obligation</hi> of it must have for ever <hi>expired</hi>; and they must have been obliged, <hi>notwithstanding</hi> that <hi>positive Institution,</hi> either wholly to have dropt their Priesthood, and with that their Publick Worship, (which was much <hi>more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> to them than that their Priests should be all of such a Family,) or to have chosen their Priests out of <hi>other</hi> Families of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi>; and if in <hi>this</hi> exigence they had done the <hi>later,</hi> there is no doubt but that the Divine Providence which <hi>created</hi> the <hi>necessity,</hi> must thereby have designedly <hi>dispensed</hi> with its own <hi>institution,</hi> and so have left them free to make Priests out of other Families. And by the same reason, when ever the divine Providence doth by <hi>unavoidable</hi> necessity deprive any Church of its Episcopacy, it thereby, for the <hi>present</hi> at least, and whilst the necessity <hi>continues, releases</hi> it from the <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of the Institution of Episcopacy, and <hi>allows</hi> it to administer its Government and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline by a <hi>Parity</hi> of Presbyters. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so long as it doth not <hi>renounce</hi> the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, but still continues in Communion with <hi>other</hi> Churches that enjoy it, it ought to be look'd upon and communicated with as a <hi>true</hi> Member (though a <hi>maimed</hi> one) of the Church Catholick; For the Catholick Church never <hi>denied</hi> her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to any Christian or Community of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans upon any <hi>unavoidable deviation</hi> from <hi>positive Institution.</hi> It was without doubt as great a <hi>devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> from <hi>positive Institution</hi> for <hi>Lay-men</hi> to <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,</hi> as for a <hi>Parity</hi> of Presbyters to <hi>Govern</hi> or <hi>Ordain,</hi> &amp;c. and yet in cases of <hi>necessity</hi> the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church always allowed the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:58668:168"/>
as deeming Baptism in <hi>it self</hi> more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than the administration of Baptism by <hi>persons</hi> in <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> and therefore where such persons could not be had, she thought meet rather to admit that <hi>Lay-men</hi> should administer it, than to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer such as were qualified for it to die <hi>unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</hi> And why may we not reasonably suppose that the Catholick Church will admit <hi>Presbyters</hi> to <hi>Govern</hi> and <hi>Ordain,</hi> where there are no <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> to be had, since it hath admitted <hi>Lay-men</hi> to <hi>Baptize,</hi> where there are neither Bishops nor Presbyters to be had? Since the <hi>later</hi> is as great a <hi>deflection</hi> from <hi>positive Institution</hi> as the <hi>former:</hi> And if the Catholick Church may be <hi>reasonably</hi> presumed to allow it in such <hi>necessary</hi> cases, we must acknowledge either that she hath not <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> enough to <hi>provide</hi> against her own <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> which supposes her to be very <hi>defective</hi>; or that her allowance is <hi>sufficient</hi> to authorize such persons to <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Ordain,</hi> as well as to <hi>Baptize,</hi> in case of <hi>necessity,</hi> as are not authorized by <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Institution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though a Community of Christians <hi>may</hi> be a <hi>true</hi> part of the Catholick Church, and in Communion with it, though it hath <hi>no</hi> Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy; yet it is plain case, that if it <hi>rejects</hi> the Episcopacy, and <hi>separates</hi> from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of it, it thereby wholly <hi>divides it self</hi> from the Communion of the Catholick Church. For whether Episcopacy <hi>be</hi> of divine Institution or <hi>no,</hi> this is matter of fact granted on all hands, that for twelve hundred years at least <hi>all</hi> those Churches into which the Catholick Church hath been <hi>distributed</hi> have been subject to the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:58668:169"/>
                  <hi>Episcopal Government</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who now <hi>separate</hi> themselves from the <hi>Episcopal Communion</hi> as such, must in so doing <hi>separate</hi> themselves from the <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>all</hi> Churches for twelve hundred years together, and then either all those Churches must be <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Catholick Church, and consequently during all that time there must be <hi>no</hi> such thing as a <hi>visible Catholick Church</hi> upon Earth; or else those Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Christians which separate from <hi>all</hi> those Churches must be <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Separations</hi> from the Catholick Church.</p>

               <p>First, The <hi>first</hi> and <hi>supreme</hi> Minister by which Christ rules his Kingdom is the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>second</hi> and <hi>next</hi> to him are the <hi>Angels</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>third</hi> are <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:58668:169"/>Fourthly, The <hi>last</hi> are the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The <hi>supreme Minister</hi> by which Christ rules his Kingdom is the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or Third Person in the Holy Trinity, of whose <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry</hi> under our Saviour in his Kingdom I have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at large from P. 49. to P. 98.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Therefore the next Order of Ministers by which Christ rules his Kingdom are the <hi>Angels</hi> of God, that is, the whole world of <hi>Angels,</hi> whether they be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> Angels of <hi>Light,</hi> or Angels of <hi>Darkness.</hi> In the prosecution of which Argument I shall endeavour first to prove the thing, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Angels, both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad, are</hi> the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Christ in the Government of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To shew wherein their Ministry doth consist. First, That the Angels, both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> are Christ's <hi>Ministers</hi> in his Kingdom; For as for the <hi>good</hi> Angels, they are <hi>subjected</hi> to Christ by the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Appointment</hi> of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; who is the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> and to whom they are inviolably obedient: And for the <hi>bad,</hi> they are <hi>subjected</hi> to him by just <hi>Conquest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to their own Wills and Inclinations. Of each of which I shall endeavour to give some brief account.</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>good</hi> Angels are <hi>subjected</hi> to Christ by the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Appointment</hi> of God, to whom they are always inviolably obedient. It seems at least very probable, that <hi>before</hi> our Saviour was Exalted upon his Triumphant <hi>Ascension</hi> into Heaven to the universal Empire of the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58668:170"/>
World under God the Father, the <hi>Angelical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers</hi> were <hi>not all</hi> of them <hi>subjected</hi> to his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Royalty, but that <hi>some</hi> of them had their <hi>distinct Regencies</hi> and <hi>Presidentships,</hi> immediately under God the most high Father, over such and such Nations and Countries as he in his <hi>Grace</hi> thought meet to allot to them, for so it is evident the Septuagint thought, when in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.8. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>he, (i. e.</hi> God,) <hi>set the bounds of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to the number of the Children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> they render it, <hi>He set the bounds of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to the number of the Angels of God</hi>; for as the ancient Jews distributed the <hi>Gentile</hi> world into seventy two <hi>Nations,</hi> so they also reckoned seventy two <hi>Angels</hi> that presided over them; and indeed considering what follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>For the Lord's portion is his People, Iacob is the lot of his inheritance,</hi> it seems very probable that this <hi>translation</hi> of the Septuagint was the true sense of the <hi>Original, viz.</hi> that whereas God distributed the <hi>Gentile</hi> world into so many <hi>Nations</hi> as there were <hi>President Angels</hi> to be their <hi>Guardians</hi> and <hi>Governours,</hi> he reserved <hi>Israel</hi> to <hi>himself</hi> as his <hi>own Lot</hi> and <hi>Portion,</hi> over which he intended to preside <hi>immediately</hi> in his <hi>own</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and therefore, as a learned Writer of our own hath observed, it is not at all improbable but that instead of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> i. e. <hi>the Sons of Israel,</hi> as it is now in our Hebrew Copies the ancient reading whence the Septuagint translated might be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> i. e. <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> and that <hi>El</hi> might either be mistaken by the Transcribers for a final abbreviation of <hi>Israel,</hi> or changed into <hi>Il,</hi> which is the contraction of <hi>Israel,</hi> and if in the ancient
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:58668:170"/>
Hebrew it was <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> it is no wonder that the Septuagint rendered it <hi>the Angels of God</hi>; the <hi>Sons of God</hi> being in Scripture a very common Appellation of <hi>Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whether this be so or not, it is evident, that when God threatned to withdraw his <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal presence</hi> from <hi>Israel</hi> upon their worshipping the golden Calf, and to put them under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of an <hi>Angel,</hi> Exod. 33.2, 3. the meaning of it was, that he would no longer <hi>preside</hi> over them in his <hi>own Person,</hi> but <hi>subject</hi> them to the Government of a <hi>President Angel,</hi> and therefore <hi>ver.</hi> 20. he bids them <hi>beware of</hi> this Angel, <hi>and obey his voice, and not provoke him</hi>; for, saith he, <hi>he will not pardon your iniquities:</hi> which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shews, that this <hi>Angel</hi> was to have had a <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power</hi> over them to <hi>pardon</hi> or <hi>punish</hi> them at his own pleasure; so that that which God here <hi>Threatned</hi> was, that he would put them in the <hi>same</hi> condition with other <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations, who were <hi>subjected</hi> to the Government of <hi>particular Guardian Angels,</hi> and so change their <hi>Theocracy</hi> into an <hi>Angelocracy.</hi> And so as it is evident <hi>Moses</hi> understood him, for <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. he thus prays, <hi>If thy Presence go not with me, carry us not up hence, for wherein shall it be known here that I and thy People have found grace in thy sight, is it not that Thou goest with us, so shall we be separated, I and thy People, from all the People that are on the face of the Earth:</hi> where it is very plain, that that which <hi>distinguished Israel</hi> from all <hi>other</hi> Nations was this, that God himself in his own Person <hi>immediately presided</hi> over them, and that if this distinction were taken away by <hi>God's with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:58668:171"/>
from them, and <hi>subjecting</hi> them to the Presidence of an <hi>Angel,</hi> they would be left in the <hi>same</hi> condition with other <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations, who must therefore be supposed to be under the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Conduct</hi> of <hi>President Angels.</hi> And this is most evident of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Greece</hi> in particular, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.13, 20. where there is mention made of two <hi>Angels</hi> under the Character of <hi>the Prince of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> and <hi>the Prince of Greece,</hi> and also of a Third, viz. <hi>Michael</hi> who is stiled <hi>one of the chief Princes,</hi> and <hi>Michael your Prince,</hi> ver. 21. and elsewhere <hi>the great Prince which standeth for the Children of thy People,</hi> Dan. 12.1. and upon what other account can we suppose them to be stiled the <hi>Princes</hi> of those Countries, but because they <hi>presided</hi> over them as their <hi>Guardians</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</hi> It is true, as for the last of them, viz. <hi>Michael,</hi> he is supposed by very learned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors to be no other than <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> who, as I have proved at large, was always the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Guardian</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi>; but if he were not <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> but merely a created <hi>Angel,</hi> it is certain he was not the <hi>President</hi> or <hi>Guardian</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi>; since, as was shewn before, they had no <hi>other Guardian</hi> but <hi>God himself</hi>; but in all probability he was the <hi>Prince</hi> of those <hi>Angels</hi> that ministred to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> in his <hi>Guardianship</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi>; and consequently that <hi>Angel</hi> of his to whom he intended to <hi>subject</hi> them, when he threatened to <hi>withdraw</hi> his <hi>personal Conduct</hi> from them, upon which account he might be called <hi>their Prince,</hi> because under Christ he had a <hi>Principal</hi> share in the <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Government</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:58668:171"/>
of them. Now these <hi>Guardian Angels</hi> seem to have been <hi>Archangels,</hi> or the <hi>Princes</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct <hi>Orders</hi> of Angels; for so <hi>Michael</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stiled an <hi>Archangel, Iude</hi> 9. but he is also said to have an <hi>Army of Angels</hi> under his Command and Conduct, and with them to have fought <hi>with the Dragon</hi> or Satan (who was also an Archangel) <hi>and his Angels,</hi> Rev. 12.7. Now though <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> (supposing him to be a <hi>created</hi> Spirit) was not a <hi>Guardian Angel,</hi> yet the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> by stiling him <hi>one of the Chief Princes</hi> plainly assures us that he was an Angel of the <hi>same Rank</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> with the <hi>Princes</hi> or Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angels of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi>; from whence it follows, that those <hi>Guardian Angels</hi> were <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels,</hi> as well as he, and consequently that they also had <hi>their Angels</hi> or <hi>appropriate Armies</hi> of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, under their Conduct and Command, in which Armies of theirs (whose <hi>Ministry</hi> without doubt they always used in the Administration of their respective <hi>Guardianships</hi>) there is no question but there was an exact <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which cannot well be supposed without supposing in them particular <hi>Officers</hi> subordinated to each other under their respective <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>Archangels</hi>; and this seems to be implied in that distinction which the Apostle makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these <hi>heavenly Spirits,</hi> Col. 1.16. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or Powers</hi>; where by <hi>Thrones</hi> he seems to mean the respective <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>Archangels</hi> of the several Orders; by <hi>Dominions</hi> or Lordships, the <hi>Reguli</hi> or chief <hi>Dignitaries</hi> under the Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; by <hi>Principalities,</hi> their <hi>Governours</hi> of such
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58668:172"/>
Provinces or Cities as were within their Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anships; by <hi>Powers,</hi> their inferiour <hi>Magistrates</hi> or <hi>Officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Archangels</hi> therefore, who were the <hi>Tutelar</hi> or <hi>Guardian</hi> Angels of Countries, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their respective <hi>Cohorts</hi> or <hi>Armies</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> seem not to have been subjected to the <hi>Mediatorial Dominion</hi> of our Saviour, till <hi>after</hi> his Ascension into Heaven; at which time it seems God totally <hi>dissolved</hi> those <hi>Angelocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> or <hi>Angelical Governments</hi> of Countries and Nations, and subjected both them and the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels</hi> (together with their Armies of Angels) that governed them to the <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Scepter of our Lord and Saviour; upon which he who <hi>before</hi> was King <hi>only</hi> of the <hi>Iews, vid.</hi> P. 224, 225. became <hi>universal</hi> Lord and Emperour of the <hi>World,</hi> for so <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5. we are told, <hi>That to the Angels God hath not put in subjection the World to come,</hi> or future Age, as it is in the Greek; where by the <hi>future Age</hi> it is evident he means the time of the Gospel; for this is the very Phrase used by the Septuagint: to express the State of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.6. where Christ is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The Father of the future Age.</hi> This passage therefore of God's not subjecting the <hi>future age</hi> to the Angels, plainly implies that he had subjected the <hi>past age</hi> to them, by constituting them the Guardians of Nations, but that now in this <hi>age of the Gospel</hi> he hath wholly <hi>dissolved</hi> that Oeconomy by subjecting both the <hi>Guardians,</hi> and the <hi>Nations</hi> they guarded, to the Dominion of our Lord and Saviour; so that <hi>now</hi> the whole world of <hi>Angels</hi> is in the <hi>same subjection</hi> to Jesus
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:58668:172"/>
Christ, as it seems <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels were <hi>before</hi> Christ's Exaltation, that is, they are now no longer subject as <hi>Deputy Governours</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and Nations, who as such were impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do <hi>good</hi> or <hi>hurt</hi> to those who were under their Government, according to their own <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> but as the <hi>immediate</hi> attendants of his person to whom nothing is left arbitrary, but all they do is <hi>determined</hi> by the <hi>sovereign Will</hi> of him who imploys them; for thus the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that upon his <hi>Ascension</hi> into Heaven he was vested with a <hi>new Dominion</hi> over the <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal World</hi>; so 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. we are told, that it was upon his <hi>going into Heaven, and sitting down at the right hand of God,</hi> that <hi>Angels, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and Powers were made subject to him</hi>; and in <hi>Eph.</hi> 20.21. that God <hi>raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places far above all Principality, and Power, and Might, and Dominion, i. e.</hi> above all Angels of what rank and quality soever, <hi>and every name that is named, not only in this World, but also in that which is to come</hi>; and accordingly, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. he is said to be <hi>head of all Principality and power, i. e.</hi> of all the heavenly Hierarchy, as well as earthly Dominions; thus also the Apostle tells us, that upon his Ascension into Heaven God <hi>hath given him a name above every name, that at the name of Iesus every knee should bow, i. e.</hi> that every Being should acknowledge subjection, <hi>either of things in Heaven, or of things on Earth, or things under the Earth; i. e.</hi> whether of Angels, or Men, or Devils. And as all these Angelical Powers are now <hi>subjected</hi> to Christ, so do they all of them <hi>minister</hi>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:58668:173"/>
under him in his Kingdom; for so <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. they are said to be all of them <hi>ministring Spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of Salvation,</hi> and in so doing they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily minister under him who is <hi>the Captain of our salvation</hi>; and accordingly in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6. those seven Angels which in <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ch.</hi> 4.10. are said to be <hi>the seven eyes of the Lord which run to and fro the whole Earth</hi>; and therefore stiled <hi>the Watchers, Dan.</hi> 4.13. as being the chief Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the divine Providence, are called <hi>the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven eyes of the Lamb,</hi> by whose Ministry and Agency he inspects and governs his Kingdom, which plainly implies, that they now minister to the <hi>Exalted Mediator</hi> in the same capacity that they heretofore ministred to <hi>God Almighty</hi> himself.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And then secondly, as the <hi>good</hi> Angels are subjected to Christ by the <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>appointment</hi> of God, so the <hi>bad</hi> are subjected to him by <hi>just</hi> and <hi>lawful Conquest,</hi> for so the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture assures us, that our blessed Saviour <hi>subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> them to his Mediatorial Empire by pure dint of just <hi>force</hi> and <hi>violence</hi>; for so we find in his <hi>life-time</hi> he frequently <hi>contested</hi> with these evil spirits, and in despite of <hi>all</hi> their power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice continually <hi>vanquished</hi> and <hi>repelled</hi> them. Thus in his <hi>Temptation</hi> in the Wilderness with on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that powerful Command, <hi>Get thee hence Satan,</hi> he put the Devil to flight, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10, 11. so also upon his approach towards the two possessed <hi>Gergesens</hi> the Devils that possessed them made a hideous outcry, <hi>What have we to do with thee Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus thou Son of God, art thou come hither to torment
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:58668:173"/>
us before the time?</hi> and were <hi>forced</hi> to depart immediately upon his Command, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.29.— Nor did he only vanquish them himself in all the personal conflicts he had with them, but he also <hi>gave</hi> his Disciples <hi>authority over all Devils,</hi> Luke 9.1. insomuch that, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17. his Disciples acquaint him, <hi>Lord even the Devils are subject unto us through thy Name</hi>; but these were only so many successful <hi>skirmishes</hi> with those Powers of darkness in which they fought against him, sometimes in <hi>single</hi> Combate, and sometimes in smaller <hi>Parties</hi>; but the <hi>main Battel</hi> in which they engaged him with <hi>all</hi> their power and might, and by winning of which he <hi>compleated</hi> his Conquest, and finally <hi>subdued</hi> them to his Empire, seems to have been that which he fought in his <hi>last Agony,</hi> wherein after they had reduced him to the <hi>utmost distress,</hi> he struck them with the <hi>spiritual Thunderbolts</hi> of inward horror and confusion, and in a Panick Dread forced them to turn their backs and flee from him. For first, it is evident that before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Garden where his Agony seized him, he <hi>expected</hi> some terrible <hi>assault</hi> from these <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Powers</hi>; so he tells his Disciples just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went thither, <hi>Hereafter I will not talk much with you, for the Prince of this world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and hath nothing in me, i. e.</hi> give me leave <hi>now</hi> to discourse freely with you, because within a very <hi>little while</hi> I shall be so <hi>engaged,</hi> that I shall not be at leisure to discharge my mind to you; for the Prince of Devils is <hi>just now</hi> mustering up all his Legions against me, and is <hi>coming</hi> to make his <hi>last effort</hi> upon me; but this is my comfort, he will find
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58668:174"/>
                  <hi>nothing</hi> in me, no <hi>sinful inclination</hi> to take part with him, no <hi>guilty reflection</hi> to expose me to his Tyranny, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.30. and accordingly, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.53. when the Jews had apprehended him, he expostulates the case with them, why they did not lay hands on him before, when he <hi>was daily with them in the Temple</hi>; and then answers himself, <hi>But now is your hour and the power of darkness</hi>; as much as if he should have said, I need not wonder you did not seize me <hi>sooner,</hi> for this alas is the <hi>appointed</hi> time wherein my <hi>Father</hi> had decreed to let loose the <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>you</hi> upon me. Which plainly shews that in that dismal hour he was assaulted by the <hi>Devils</hi> as well as by the <hi>Iews</hi>; for in all probability those <hi>crafty</hi> and <hi>sagacious spirits</hi> had smelt out the <hi>merciful design</hi> of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching <hi>death, viz.</hi> that it was to be a <hi>ransom</hi> for the sins of the World; and therefore though they were <hi>desirous</hi> enough of his <hi>death,</hi> as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by their animating <hi>Iudas</hi> and the Jews against him, yet dreading the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>intention</hi> of it, they resolve to imploy all their Art and Power to <hi>tempt</hi> and <hi>deter</hi> him from undergoing it, and either to prevail with him to <hi>avoid</hi> it by a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Recantation,</hi> or at least <hi>not</hi> to <hi>consent</hi> to it; that so being <hi>forced</hi> and <hi>involuntary,</hi> it might be <hi>void</hi> and <hi>ineffectual.</hi> In which black design of theirs God himself thought meet <hi>so far</hi> to favour them as to give them his free <hi>permission</hi> to <hi>try</hi> him to the utmost; that so having <hi>experienced</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the utmost force of Temptation that <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature</hi> is liable to, he might thereby be touched with a more <hi>tender sympathy</hi> with it, or as the Author to the Hebrews expresses it, <hi>That
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:58668:174"/>
having suffered himself being tempted he might be able to succour them that are tempted,</hi> Chap. 17.18. But then secondly, if we consider the woful <hi>Circumstances</hi> of his <hi>Agony,</hi> it is evident, that it was the effect of some far <hi>more powerful cause</hi> than meerly a <hi>natural fear</hi> of his ensuing Death and bodily Torment; for no sooner was he entered on that Tragick Stage, but <hi>he began to be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful,</hi> saith <hi>S. Matthew, Chap.</hi> 26.37. or <hi>to be sore amazed,</hi> as <hi>S. Mark, Chap.</hi> 14.33. or <hi>to be very heavy,</hi> as both; which words according to their native signification declare him to have been all on a sudden oppressed with some <hi>mighty damp,</hi> which arising from some <hi>fearful spectacle</hi> or <hi>imagination,</hi> overwhelmed his Soul with an <hi>unknown</hi> and <hi>inexpressible anguish,</hi> an Anguish that sunk and depressed him into as <hi>deep</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection as it was possible for an <hi>innocent mind</hi> to endure, causing him to groan out that sad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, <hi>My Soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, i. e.</hi> My Soul is encompassed with grief, and like a desolate Island surrounded on every side with an Ocean of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and that even <hi>unto death,</hi> as if it had been <hi>strugling</hi> under some mortal Pang, and the pains of Hell had got hold upon it. And so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable</hi> was his Passion, that though he liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>vented</hi> it both at his <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Lips</hi> in <hi>Tears,</hi> and <hi>Sighs,</hi> and sorrowful <hi>complaints</hi>; yet that was not a sufficient <hi>discharge</hi> for it, but through all the innumerable Pores of his body it <hi>poured</hi> out it self <hi>as it were in great drops of bloud,</hi> Luke 22.44. All which considered, I can by no means think that that which occasioned this bitter Agony

was <hi>meerly</hi> the <hi>prospect</hi> of what he was going to suffer from the hands of men, since not only some <hi>Martyrs,</hi> but some <hi>Malefactors</hi> have suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much more with less dejection; and if you consult the History, you will find that he bore his <hi>death</hi> far better than his <hi>Agony,</hi> from whence we have just reason to believe that the <hi>later</hi> was <hi>more grievous</hi> to him than the <hi>former,</hi> and that the Crucifixion of his <hi>body</hi> on the <hi>Cross</hi> was nothing near so painful to him as the crucifixion of his <hi>mind</hi> in the <hi>Garden.</hi> And since his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in his <hi>Agony</hi> are described with more Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Circumstances than his sufferings on the <hi>Cross,</hi> we have just reason to conclude they were inflicted on him by <hi>more spiteful</hi> and <hi>powerful exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners,</hi> and consequently that he endured the Tortures of <hi>men</hi> only on the <hi>Cross,</hi> but of <hi>Devils</hi> in the <hi>Garden,</hi> where being left all alone <hi>naked</hi> and <hi>abandoned</hi> of the <hi>ordinary supports</hi> of his <hi>Godhead,</hi> and having only an <hi>Angel</hi> to stand by and comfort him (<hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>represent</hi> such conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to him of the <hi>benefits</hi> and <hi>advantages</hi> of his <hi>Death,</hi> as were most proper to fortifie him against the Temptations which the Devils were then urging to deter him from it) he was in all probability surrounded with a <hi>mighty Host</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> who exercised all their <hi>power</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> to persecute his <hi>innocent soul,</hi> to <hi>distract</hi> and <hi>fright</hi> it with horrid <hi>Phantasms,</hi> to <hi>afflict</hi> it with dismal <hi>suggestions,</hi> and <hi>vex</hi> and <hi>cruciate</hi> it with dire <hi>imaginations</hi> and dreadful <hi>spectacles.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If we consider that strange unaccountable <hi>drowsiness</hi> which seized his Disciples whilst he was in his <hi>Agony,</hi> it seems to have been the effect
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:58668:175"/>
of a <hi>Diabolical power</hi>; for before he entered into the Garden he had <hi>expresly</hi> told them that the <hi>Hour was come,</hi> wherein he was to be taken from them by an untimely death; so that one would have thought the <hi>dear love</hi> which they bore him, together with the <hi>infinite Concern</hi> they had in him, might have been sufficient to have kept them <hi>awake</hi> for a <hi>few hours</hi>; yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he desired them to <hi>watch</hi> with him, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loth it seems to be left <hi>alone</hi> in a dark night among a company of horrid and frightful <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctres</hi>) upon his return to them he found them <hi>fast asleep,</hi> and though he gently upbraided them with their <hi>unkindness, What could ye not watch with me one hour?</hi> Yet he no sooner left them but they fell asleep <hi>again</hi>; for as the Text tells us, <hi>their eyes were heavy.</hi> Heavy indeed, that could not hold up for a <hi>few hours</hi> upon such an <hi>awakening</hi> occasion. It is true indeed <hi>S. Luke</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes this prodigious <hi>drowsiness</hi> of theirs to their <hi>sorrow,</hi> and so it is usual in Scripture to put the <hi>apparent</hi> cause for the <hi>real,</hi> when the <hi>real</hi> cause is <hi>secret</hi> and <hi>invisible.</hi> But how can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that <hi>meer sorrow</hi> should necessitate <hi>three men</hi> to fall <hi>asleep together</hi> under the most <hi>awakening</hi> Circumstances, all things considered, that ever hapned to Mortals? Why did it not as well force them to fall asleep again <hi>afterwards,</hi> when their Lord was <hi>apprehended, condemned,</hi> and <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified?</hi> At all which times they were doubtless rather <hi>more sorrowful</hi> than they were in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and therefore it seems very probable that there was a much <hi>more powerful cause</hi> than <hi>sorrow</hi> in the case, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>preternatural stup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>faction</hi> of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:58668:176"/>
their senses by some of those <hi>malignant spirits</hi> that were then conflicting with our Saviour, who perhaps to deprive him of the solace of his Disciples company, did by their <hi>Diabolical Art</hi> produce that <hi>extraordinary stupor</hi> that oppressed them; that so having him all <hi>alone,</hi> they might have the greater <hi>advantage</hi> to tempt and terrifie him. Fourthly and lastly, If we consider the <hi>warning</hi> our Saviour gave his Disciples, when they entered the Garden with him, of the <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary danger</hi> they were in of falling into <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,</hi> it seems very probable that he <hi>expected</hi> and <hi>found</hi> there an extraordinary Concourse of <hi>Tempters</hi> or evil Spirits; for as soon as they were entered with him into the Garden, <hi>S. Luke</hi> tells us, that he bid them <hi>pray that ye enter not into Temptation,</hi> Luke 22.40. and when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this admonition they fell asleep the <hi>first</hi> time, he bids them again, <hi>watch and pray that ye enter not into Temptation,</hi> Matth. 26.41. which words plainly imply our Saviour's apprehension of some <hi>extraordinary danger</hi> they were in of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>tempted</hi> in the very <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> of his <hi>Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and what more probable account can be given of this apprehension of his than this, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound vast <hi>numbers</hi> of <hi>evil spirits</hi> there, by whom he himself at that very time was furiously <hi>tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>assaulted,</hi> and that therefore having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced their <hi>power</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> in <hi>himself,</hi> he thought meet to admonish his <hi>Disciples</hi> (who were much less able to resist them than <hi>he</hi>) to stand upon their guard lest they should tempt <hi>them</hi> as they had tempted <hi>him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:58668:176"/>For these reasons it seems highly probable that this <hi>last Agony</hi> of our Saviour was nothing else but a mighty <hi>struggle</hi> and <hi>conflict</hi> with the <hi>powers</hi> of <hi>darkness,</hi> who having by God's <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> mustered up all their strength against him, intending <hi>once more</hi> to try their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune against him, and if possible to <hi>tempt</hi> or <hi>deter</hi> him from prosecuting his <hi>design</hi> of <hi>redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the World, were in the end gloriously <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed</hi> by his persevering <hi>resistance,</hi> and forced to flee before him; and of this his glorious <hi>victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> over them he made an open shew upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> where in despite of all those <hi>terrors</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi> they had exercised him with, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to <hi>divert</hi> him from laying down his life for the World, he <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>voluntarily</hi> poured out his Bloud as a Sacrifice for the sins of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And hence the Apostle tells us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. that on his Cross <hi>he spoiled Principalities and Powers, viz.</hi> in that <hi>victorious Act</hi> of laying down his life to ransom us from their power in despite of their most <hi>exquisite temptations</hi> to the contrary, <hi>and made an open shew of them triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over them.</hi> And by this glorious Victory he finished his <hi>Conquest</hi> of those <hi>Infernal Powers,</hi> so that from thenceforth they never durst assault him more, but like <hi>vanquish'd Slaves,</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to yield their <hi>unwilling Necks</hi> to the yoke of his Empire, and (though with infinite <hi>Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance</hi>) to obey <hi>his</hi> Will, and execute <hi>his</hi> Orders; and hence we are told, that <hi>by his Death our Saviour hath destroyed him that hath the power of Death, that is, the Devil,</hi> Heb. 2.14. so that <hi>now</hi> at his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Name <hi>every knee must bow,</hi> or every Being
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:58668:177"/>
yield obeisance, not only <hi>of things in heaven, and of things on earth, i. e.</hi> of Angels and Men, <hi>but of things under the earth too, i. e.</hi> of Devils, who notwithstanding they are incensed with an <hi>impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable animosity</hi> against him, and would gladly pull him down from his Throne, if they had but <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> answerable to their <hi>Malice,</hi> yet having long since experienced the might of his <hi>victorious Arms,</hi> even then when they had him at the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test advantage,</hi> and being thereby driven into <hi>everlasting despair</hi> of prevailing against him, they have from thenceforth been forced by the mere <hi>dread</hi> and <hi>terrour</hi> of his power, to <hi>submit</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to him, and to become his <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> in his heavenly Kingdom; so that <hi>now</hi> whatsoever they do, it is by his <hi>Permission</hi> or <hi>Order</hi> who holds their mischievous power in Chains, and lets it loose, or restrains it as he pleases.</p>
               <p>And thus having proved at large that both the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> Angels are Christ's <hi>Subjects</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> I proceed in the second place to shew <hi>wherein</hi> their <hi>Ministry</hi> to Christ in his Kingdom consists.</p>
               <p>And in the first place, I shall shew wherein the <hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>good Angels</hi> consists.</p>
               <p>And secondly, wherein consists the <hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>bad Angels.</hi> And because the Philosophy of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of Angels is far above the ken of our short-sighted understandings, I shall not presume to inquire any farther into the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry</hi> of either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad Angels</hi> than the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> gives me light, in which we find these seven following instances of the <hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>good Angels</hi> under Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:58668:177"/>First, They <hi>declare</hi> upon occasion his <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> to his Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They <hi>guard</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> his Subjects against <hi>outward</hi> dangers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They <hi>support</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> them upon great <hi>undertakings,</hi> and under pressing <hi>Calamities.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="1">I. One instance of the <hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> in the Kingdom of Christ is their <hi>declaring</hi> upon occasion his <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> to his Church and People; for thus most of those <hi>Prophetick Messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> which God from time to time sent to the World were <hi>conveyed</hi> to the Prophets by the <hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi>; so <hi>Daniel</hi> for instance had all his Visions from an <hi>Angel</hi> of God, <hi>vid.

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:58668:178"/>
God,</hi> Act. 23.9. And accordingly we find our Saviour <hi>sending forth</hi> his holy Angels on <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Messages</hi> to his Church; for so St. <hi>Iohn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Revelations from Christ by the hand of an <hi>Angel, Rev.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16. And an <hi>Angel</hi> is sent from Christ to <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>bid</hi> him go to the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Eunuch to expound to him the Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah, Acts</hi> 8.26. And <hi>Cornelius</hi> received a <hi>Message</hi> from Christ by an <hi>Angel,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring him to send to <hi>Ioppa</hi> for St. <hi>Peter</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct him in the Christian Religion, in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.3, 4, 5. But since that Christ hath revealed his <hi>whole Will</hi> to his Church, and transmitted it down by a <hi>standing Scripture,</hi> this <hi>Ministration</hi> of the holy Angels is in a great measure <hi>ceased,</hi> and to this <hi>written Word</hi> of his we are <hi>intirely</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, as to the <hi>perpetual Rule</hi> of our Faith and Manners; insomuch that if thenceforth even <hi>an Angel from heaven should preach any other Gospel to us</hi> than what we have there received, he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>accursed,</hi> Gal. 1.8. Not but that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and upon <hi>great Emergencies,</hi> they may be still sent from heaven with <hi>new Messages</hi> to us to discover some <hi>useful secret,</hi> or to <hi>inspire</hi> our minds with the <hi>notices</hi> of some <hi>future contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> that are of great moment to us, though this very <hi>rarely,</hi> it being no part of their <hi>ordinary Ministry.</hi> But since the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel was <hi>compleated,</hi> to be sure they never reveal any <hi>new Doctrine</hi> to us; they may be <hi>assisting Geniuses</hi> to our <hi>understandings,</hi> to excite in them a true <hi>apprehension</hi> of what is <hi>already</hi> revealed, by impressing our imaginations with clear and distinct <hi>Idea's</hi> and <hi>Representations</hi> of things

that are revealed more obscurely: But to suppose that they still reveal <hi>new Doctrinal truths</hi> to us, is not only to deny the <hi>perfection</hi> of written <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but to open a wide door to all manner of <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi>

               <p n="2">II.

So also when the Apostles by an Order from the High Priest were cast into the common Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the Text tells us, <hi>That an Angel of the Lord by night opened the Prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, go stand and speak in the Temple to the People all the words of this life,</hi> Acts 5.19, 20.

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:58668:180"/>
it is not to be imagined but that were they not <hi>opposed</hi> and <hi>restrained</hi> by a <hi>mightier power</hi> than their <hi>own,</hi> they would never be able to forbear exercising their direful <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> upon us, till they had converted this Earth into <hi>Hell,</hi> and made this <hi>School</hi> of our <hi>Probation</hi> the <hi>place</hi> of our <hi>Torments</hi>; and as for the Kingdom of <hi>Christ,</hi> whose <hi>Subjects</hi> have so solemnly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced</hi> their Yoke and Dominion, to be sure they would never cease infesting it with the fiery darts of their <hi>malice,</hi> till they had utterly <hi>ruined</hi> and <hi>destroyed</hi> them; and therefore to <hi>prevent</hi> their <hi>mischievous</hi> attempts, God in mercy hath thought meet to commit us to the <hi>Guardianship</hi> of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Angels,</hi> and to send them forth under the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> our Mediator, to fight against these Hellish <hi>powers</hi> in the defence of his Church and People, for so God promised <hi>Ierusalem, Zech.</hi> 2.5. that <hi>he would be as a wall of fire round about her, i. e.</hi> as the most learned Expositors sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, by <hi>surrounding</hi> her with a <hi>Guard</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> whom in the <hi>defence</hi> of his People against <hi>evil Angels</hi> he <hi>maketh a flaming fire,</hi> as the Psalmist expresses it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.4. and in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.7. we read of <hi>a War in Heaven,</hi> (or the airy Region, of which the Devil is called the Prince) <hi>Michael and his Angels fought against the Dragon, and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon fought and his Angels</hi>; which War <hi>Michael</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, as the foregoing verses tell us, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Woman that was cloathed with the Sun,</hi> which all agree was the Christian Church; so also in <hi>verse</hi> 9. of <hi>S.

               <p>And now having explained the Ministry of the <hi>good</hi> Angels <hi>under</hi> Christ, I proceed to treat of the Ministry of the <hi>evil</hi> Angels <hi>to</hi> him, which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally consists in these four particulars:</p>
               <p>First, In <hi>trying</hi> and <hi>exercising</hi> the <hi>vertues</hi> of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In <hi>chastening</hi> and <hi>correcting</hi> their <hi>faults</hi> and <hi>miscarriages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In <hi>searing</hi> and <hi>hardening</hi> his incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible <hi>Rebels.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:58668:186"/>Fourthly, In <hi>executing</hi> his <hi>vengeance</hi> on them in another World.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Ministry of <hi>evil</hi> Angels to Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in <hi>trying</hi> and <hi>exercising</hi> the <hi>vertues</hi> of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; for <hi>this</hi> being the state of our <hi>trial</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> wherein we stand <hi>Candidates</hi> for those everlasting <hi>preferments</hi> in the other World, our blessed Lord hath thought meet to surround us with <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Temptations,</hi> that so being in continual <hi>conflict</hi> with them we may never want opportunity to <hi>exert</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> our <hi>vertues,</hi> and to give the most glorious <hi>proofs</hi> of our <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Constancy:</hi> For <hi>difficulty</hi> is the Spur of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,</hi> and the Whet-stone of <hi>Vertue,</hi> without which the <hi>fairest Graces</hi> that belong to Humane Nature would be altogether <hi>Vseless, Worthless,</hi> and <hi>Vnactive</hi>; such as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience, Temperance</hi> and <hi>Equanimity, Courage</hi> and <hi>Resignation</hi> to God, all which would scarce deserve the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> if they had not some <hi>difficulties</hi> to contest withal. Now one of the <hi>greatest difficulties</hi> with which our blessed Lord <hi>tries</hi> and <hi>exercises</hi> these <hi>Graces</hi> of our <hi>Nature,</hi> is the <hi>Temptations</hi> of <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> who as so many <hi>assisting Geniuses</hi> to the <hi>corrupt inclinations</hi> of our <hi>Nature,</hi> are permitted by him to rove about the World in innumerable swarms to <hi>Tempt</hi> and <hi>Elicite</hi> those <hi>inclinations</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>action,</hi> and these being <hi>Spirits,</hi> have a much <hi>nearer</hi> access to the <hi>Souls</hi> of men than any <hi>material</hi> Agents whatsoever; for though they are totally debarred from all kind of intercourse with the <hi>immediate operations</hi> of the <hi>reasonable Soul,</hi> and can no more look into its <hi>thoughts,</hi> than we can into the <hi>bowels</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> yet our <hi>Fancies</hi> and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:58668:186"/>
                  <hi>Imaginations</hi> lying <hi>open</hi> to them, there is no doubt but they <hi>can</hi> and oftentimes <hi>do</hi> make what use they think fit of the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> there, and <hi>dispose,</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>distinguish</hi> them, just as the <hi>Painter</hi> doth his numerous Colours that lie confusedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in their <hi>several Shells</hi> into the <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Phantasms</hi> of whatsoever Objects they please, and <hi>continue</hi> and <hi>repeat</hi> those <hi>Pictures</hi> in our <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> as long and as oft as they think meet; and then considering what the <hi>natural use</hi> of the <hi>fancy</hi> is, both to the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and how it prompts the <hi>one</hi> with matter of <hi>Invention,</hi> and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it with variety of <hi>Objects</hi> to work on, and draws forth or elicits the <hi>other</hi> to choose or refuse those <hi>Objects</hi> it presents according as they are <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miably</hi> or <hi>odiously</hi> represented; considering these things, I say, it is notorious what mighty <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi> the <hi>evil Spirits</hi> have of insinuating their black <hi>suggestions</hi> to our <hi>minds.</hi> And then they being very <hi>subtil</hi> and <hi>sagacious</hi> by nature, and having had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove five thousand years <hi>experience</hi> to cultivate their Talent of tempting and seducing us, (<hi>that</hi> having been their <hi>trade</hi> ever since they became De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils) to be sure they can never be at a <hi>loss</hi> when or how to apply themselves to us, and to nick us with <hi>such temptations</hi> as are most <hi>convenient</hi> to our <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> inclinations, conditions, and circumstances; and accordingly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. the Devil is said to have his Methods or <hi>Devices, i e.</hi> his stated <hi>Rules</hi> by which he governs his mischievous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of tempting and seducing souls, and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. we are told of <hi>the snare of the devil,</hi> or his crafty devices to intangle and captivate mens Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:58668:187"/>Now though the <hi>design</hi> of these <hi>evil Spirits</hi> in tempting Christ's Subjects is doubtless to <hi>seduce</hi> and <hi>ruine</hi> them, yet it is evident that the <hi>design</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in permitting them to tempt them is only to <hi>try</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> them, and <hi>rouse</hi> them out of their <hi>sloth</hi> and <hi>inactivity,</hi> and by the continual <hi>alarms</hi> of these their restless Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to keep them upon their <hi>guard,</hi> and make them more <hi>watchful</hi> and <hi>vigilant</hi>; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly from the consideration of that <hi>permission</hi> which these <hi>evil Spirits</hi> have to tempt us, we are in Scripture frequently exhorted to <hi>activity</hi> and <hi>vigilance</hi>; so 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Be sober, be vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, for the Devil your Adversary goeth about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour</hi>; So also, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the Wiles of the Devil.</hi> Since therefore the <hi>Devil's tempting</hi> us is used by Christ as a <hi>motive</hi> to excite our <hi>activity,</hi> it is evident that Christ's <hi>intention</hi> in permitting him to tempt us is to <hi>excite</hi> and <hi>stimulate</hi> us thereunto. It is true, the Devil's Temptations may, and often have a quite <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect</hi> on us than Christ <hi>intended</hi>; they may <hi>seduce</hi> us from our <hi>innocence</hi> and <hi>duty,</hi> and thereby involve us in <hi>everlasting perdition</hi>; but if they do, it is our <hi>own</hi> fault, and through our <hi>own</hi> consent, without which they can <hi>never</hi> prevail against us, for we are assured, that <hi>if we resist the Devil he will fly away from us,</hi> and that <hi>we shall not be tempted by him above what we are able:</hi> and we are furnished by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour with <hi>sufficient strength</hi> and <hi>assistance</hi> to repel his most <hi>powerful</hi> temptations; but if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:58668:187"/>
of imploying our <hi>strength,</hi> and exercising our <hi>vertue</hi> in a <hi>vigorous resistance</hi> of him (which is the thing Christ intended in permitting him to tempt us) we will <hi>tamely</hi> suffer our selves to be <hi>led Captive</hi> by him, we must thank <hi>our selves</hi> for all the dire and miserable consequents of it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Another instance of the <hi>Ministry</hi> of these <hi>evil Angels</hi> to Christ is their <hi>chastening</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting</hi> the faults and miscarriages of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Thus upon great and high <hi>provocations</hi> he many times lets <hi>loose</hi> these evil Spirits upon us, and permits them to pain and punish us either immediately by <hi>themselves,</hi> or mediately by their <hi>Instruments</hi>; for so only to prevent St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s being <hi>exalted above measure through the abundance of his revelations, there was given a Thorn in the flesh, the Messenger of Satan to buffet him, i. e.</hi> as it seems most probable, some <hi>evil Spirit</hi> was sent to him from Satan, the Prince of Devils, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict some corporal <hi>pain</hi> or <hi>disease</hi> on him (for so <hi>the grieving thorn, Ezek.</hi> 28.24. signifies a sore bodily affliction) and though <hi>he sought the Lord thrice for this thing that it might depart from him,</hi> yet could he receive no other Answer, but <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee,</hi> see 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9. and it is very probable that those <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, diseases,</hi> and <hi>deaths</hi> which were inflicted on the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their irreverent commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Lord's Supper, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.30. were inflicted by the Ministry of <hi>evil Angels,</hi> to whose power and malice they were <hi>abandoned</hi> by our Saviour, as a <hi>just Chastisement</hi> of their prophaneness; for so it is evident the incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person was <hi>corrected</hi> upon the Sentence
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:58668:188"/>
of his Excommunication, which was, that he should be <hi>delivered up unto Satan for the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his flesh,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. where the <hi>delivering</hi> him up to <hi>Satan</hi> seems to have been in <hi>answer</hi> to Satan's <hi>demanding</hi> of him; for so in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture the Devil is sometimes called, <hi>The accuser of the Brethren,</hi> which <hi>accuses them before God day and night,</hi> Rev. 12.10. and sometimes the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which signifies, <hi>an Adversary in Court of Iudicature,</hi> that impleads and accuses us before God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. Now this <hi>accusation</hi> of his is sometimes <hi>false</hi> and <hi>groundless,</hi> as in the case of <hi>Iob,</hi> upon which account he is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Calumniator; but sometimes he accuses us <hi>truly,</hi> for faults that are <hi>real</hi> and <hi>highly criminal,</hi> upon which he <hi>requires</hi> us of God as he did St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 22.31. <hi>i. e.</hi> he <hi>requires</hi> us as the Executioner doth a Malefactor, <hi>to sift or winnow us as Wheat, i. e.</hi> to shake and afflict us; and when ever God is pleased to <hi>answer</hi> this request, he is truly said <hi>to deliver us up to Satan</hi>; and this <hi>power</hi> of <hi>delivering up</hi> to Satan such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as are <hi>justly</hi> accused of great and scandalous sins, God hath communicated to his <hi>Church,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which <hi>delivery</hi> in the Primitive Ages (when there were no <hi>Magistrates</hi> to second the Churches <hi>Censures</hi> with Corporal punishments) Satan as the <hi>Lictor</hi> or <hi>Executioner</hi> of our Saviour <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> seized the Criminal, and inflicted on him some bodily <hi>disease</hi> or <hi>torment,</hi> which St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> calls, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the punishment of the Devil, Epist. ad Roman.</hi> for so in our Saviour's time, and before and after it, it was usual for <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> by God's <hi>permission,</hi> to inflict <hi>diseases</hi>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:58668:188"/>
and <hi>torments</hi> on mens bodies, of which there are innumerable instances in the <hi>Gospels,</hi> and the Writings of the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi>; and that this was then the usual consequence of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> is evident from that phrase, <hi>For the destruction of the flesh,</hi> which plainly signifies some <hi>corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> consequent to that Tremendous <hi>Sentence</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is therefore called <hi>a Rod,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.21. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the <hi>bodily</hi> correction that followed it.</p>
               <p>But since the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>corporal punishments</hi> hath been derived by Christ upon Christian <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,</hi> he very rarely chastens his Subjects with any <hi>bodily pains</hi> by the immediate Agency of <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> but hath wholly deposited it in the hands of the <hi>Temporal Powers,</hi> who are now his sole <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Revengers to execute wrath upon those that do evil.</hi> But yet still upon occasion he so far makes use of the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>Devils</hi> in <hi>correcting</hi> us, as to permit them to <hi>excite</hi> wicked <hi>men,</hi> and especially wicked <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> to plague and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute us: When he sees his <hi>Church</hi> or any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>part</hi> of it degenerating from the <hi>purity</hi> of his Religion, or waxing <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>remiss</hi> in their love and duty to him, he many times gives a <hi>loose</hi> to these malignant <hi>Spirits,</hi> who always burn with <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate rancour</hi> against it, and permits them to <hi>provoke</hi> and <hi>stimulate</hi> its Enemies to exert and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their power against it; So that whatsoever mischiefs <hi>wicked Princes</hi> or <hi>men</hi> do to the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ, or to any part of it, they do it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the <hi>Instruments</hi> of these <hi>evil Angels</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by their mischievous <hi>suggestions</hi> and <hi>instigations</hi>; for so Christ tells the Church of <hi>Symrna</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The Devil shall cast some of you into prison,</hi> that is,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:58668:189"/>
the <hi>wicked Governours</hi> there shall do it by the <hi>insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> to whom I will certainly give <hi>permission</hi> to <hi>instigate</hi> them thereunto, for so Christ is said to <hi>have the Keys of the bottomless Pit,</hi> Rev. 1.18. that is, power to <hi>confine</hi> or let <hi>loose</hi> those <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> that inhabit it, at his pleasure; and when he thinks fit, to <hi>confine</hi> them, we find the Church enjoys <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>rest,</hi> and <hi>prosperity, Rev.</hi> 20.1.2, 3, 4. but no sooner doth he let them <hi>loose</hi> again, but they are immediately <hi>instigating</hi> the <hi>wicked powers</hi> of the Earth to <hi>fight</hi> against it and <hi>persecute</hi> it, <hi>Ibid. ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9. from whence it is evident that the <hi>power</hi> of these <hi>evil Spirits</hi> to <hi>excite</hi> evil Princes or men to <hi>persecute</hi> his <hi>Church</hi> is under the <hi>restraint</hi> and <hi>determination</hi> of our Saviour, that they can proceed no farther in this their mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous design, than <hi>he</hi> thinks meet to <hi>permit</hi> them, and consequently, that in all those <hi>persecutions</hi> to which <hi>they</hi> excite their <hi>Instruments,</hi> they are but the <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Executioners</hi> of Christ, even as the <hi>Dog</hi> is the <hi>Shepherds</hi> in worrying the <hi>straying</hi> sheep into the fold.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Another instance of the <hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>evil Spirits</hi> to Christ is their <hi>hardening</hi> and <hi>confirming</hi> incorrigible and obstinate sinners in their wicked purposes.

               <p n="4">IV.

For since, as I have shewn before, our Saviour makes use of the power and malice of these <hi>evil Spirits</hi> to <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>chasten</hi> men in <hi>this</hi> life, why may we not thence conclude, that he makes use of the same to <hi>plague</hi> and <hi>punish</hi> them in the life <hi>to come</hi>; especially considering that they bear the <hi>same malice</hi> to us in the <hi>other</hi> life that they did in <hi>this</hi>; for they tempt us to <hi>sin here</hi> for no other end but that they may make us <hi>miserable

their <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>fury,</hi> for though our <hi>Souls</hi> are no more impressible by <hi>corporeal</hi> action than the <hi>beams</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> are by the blows of a <hi>Hammer,</hi> yet that they can feel the force of <hi>spiritual action,</hi> we find by every days experience; for so a <hi>thought</hi> which is a <hi>spiritual</hi> action, if it be very <hi>horrible</hi> or <hi>dismal,</hi> doth as sensibly <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>aggrieve</hi> our <hi>Souls,</hi> as the most exquisite <hi>Corporeal torment</hi> can our <hi>Bodies.</hi> Now there is no doubt but <hi>evil Spirits</hi> can suggest preternatural <hi>horrors</hi> to our <hi>minds,</hi> and repeat and urge them with such <hi>Importunity</hi> and <hi>vehemence,</hi> as to render them most exquisitely <hi>painful</hi> and <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous,</hi> of the truth of which we have a woful <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> in that miserable Wretch, <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> who upon that woful breach he made in his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> by <hi>renouncing</hi> his Religion, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had received several kind <hi>admonitions</hi> from Heaven to the contrary, was <hi>forsaken</hi> of God, and <hi>delivered up</hi> alive into the hands of those dire <hi>Tormenters</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi>; whereupon though he had not the least symptome of <hi>bodily melancholy,</hi> he was immediatly seized with such an inexpressible <hi>Agony</hi> of <hi>mind,</hi> as amazed his Physicians, asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his Friends, and struck terror into all that beheld him; for he was so near to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a <hi>damned Spirit,</hi> that he verily believed <hi>Hell</hi> it self was <hi>more tolerable</hi> than those <hi>invisible la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes</hi> that his <hi>Soul</hi> endured without any intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore he often wished that he were in Hell, and as often attempted to dispatch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thither in hope to find sanctuary <hi>there</hi> from those <hi>direful thoughts</hi> which continually preyed upon his Soul. Now that these <hi>Horrors</hi> were inflicted on him by <hi>Diabolical suggestion</hi> is evident

both by the impenetrable <hi>hardness</hi> and <hi>obstinacy</hi> of his mind against all the motives of <hi>Repentance</hi> that accompanied them, and by the horrible <hi>bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemies</hi> they frequently extorted from him. And if now in this life they have so much power to <hi>torment</hi> our <hi>minds,</hi> whenever God thinks it meet to let them <hi>loose</hi> upon us, what will they have <hi>hereafter,</hi> when our wretched <hi>Spirits</hi> shall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>abandoned</hi> to their mercy, and they shall have a <hi>free</hi> scope to exert their <hi>fury</hi> on us; and <hi>glut</hi> their hungry <hi>malice</hi> with our <hi>Torment</hi> and <hi>vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation?</hi> And since it is evident they do not want <hi>power,</hi> we may certainly conclude even from that <hi>natural malignity</hi> that is in the temper of a Devil, they do not want <hi>Will</hi> to plague and torture us in the <hi>other</hi> World. And this <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of theirs our Saviour makes use of as the <hi>Common Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner</hi> of his Vengeance upon incorrigible sinners in the <hi>other</hi> Life; for as soon as ever a wicked <hi>Soul</hi> departs from its <hi>Body,</hi> it is immediatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed into the hands of those <hi>Diabolical Furies,</hi> who like so many hungry Hounds seize it with infinite greediness, and fall a <hi>tearing</hi> and <hi>worry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it with horrible <hi>suggestions</hi> without any pause or intermission, and by continually recording its sins to it, and reproaching it with the <hi>folly</hi> of them, and putting it in mind of that dismal <hi>eternal</hi> futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it must suffer for them, do incessantly <hi>sting</hi> and <hi>vex</hi> it with swarms of <hi>dire reflections</hi> and <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting thoughts,</hi> which are the only <hi>Instruments</hi> of Torment that can fasten upon a <hi>Soul.</hi> And hence in <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.34. the Devils, to whom the wicked Servant was <hi>delivered</hi> up by his Master for his cruelty toward his fellow Servant are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Third sort of the Ministers of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of the World; for though there are many <hi>Infidel Kings</hi> in the World that know not Christ, and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver submitted themselves to his Empire, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of that do openly defie and persecute his holy Religion, yet <hi>these</hi> of right are <hi>subject</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> though in fact they are <hi>inslaved</hi> to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> hath the <hi>disposal</hi> of their Crowns, and the <hi>command</hi> of their power, and doth actually <hi>imploy</hi> and <hi>use</hi> it, even as he doth the power of the <hi>Devils,</hi> in the prosecution of the righteous <hi>ends</hi> of his Government. And though too many of <hi>those Kings</hi> who by their <hi>visible</hi> profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, have actually <hi>submitted</hi> themselves to the Scepter of <hi>Christ,</hi> have yet together with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity espoused the Interest of sundry <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Principles, in pursuance of which they have been as inveterate Enemies and Persecutors of <hi>the truth as it is in Iesus</hi> as any of the Heathen Kings or Emperors; yet <hi>these</hi> also, notwithstanding their male-administration are the <hi>Subjects</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> of our Saviour, and it is by <hi>his Authority</hi> and <hi>Commission</hi> that they Reign, and by <hi>his</hi> Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent <hi>Providence</hi> that all their wicked designs and actions are <hi>over-ruled</hi> to gracious ends and purposes: so that all the <hi>Sovereign Powers</hi> of the Earth are <hi>subjected</hi> by God to the Dominion of

               <p>But for the farther prosecution of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I shall shew in the first place, that by this their <hi>subjection</hi> to Christ they are not <hi>deprived</hi> of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:58668:193"/>
any <hi>natural Right</hi> of their <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they are <hi>obliged</hi> by it to certain <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistries</hi> in the Kingdom of Christ.</p>
               <p>First, That by their <hi>subjection</hi> they are not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived</hi> of any <hi>natural Right</hi> of their Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for when our Saviour pronounced the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <hi>Give unto Cesar the things that are Cesars,</hi> he thereby <hi>renewed</hi> the Patent of Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and <hi>reinvested</hi> them in all the <hi>natural Rights</hi> of their Sovereignty which doubtless are included in <hi>the things that are Cesars,</hi> for upon the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees asking him that captious question, <hi>Is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to pay Tribute to Cesar?</hi> He doth not answer yes it is <hi>lawful,</hi> which yet had been a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reply to their Question, but calls for a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute Peny, and having asked them <hi>whose I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Superscription</hi> that was upon it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing answered <hi>Cesars,</hi> he returns them an Answer much larger than their Question, <hi>Give unto Cesar the things that are Cesars, (i. e.)</hi> it is certain that you are obliged <hi>not only</hi> to pay <hi>Tribute</hi> to <hi>Cesar,</hi> but also to render him <hi>whatever else</hi> is <hi>due</hi> to him by vertue of his Sovereign Power, for Sovereign Power being <hi>immediatly</hi> founded on the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God hath from thence these two <hi>unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Rights derived to it, to which all the <hi>essential</hi> Rights of Sovereignty are Reducible: First to Command in <hi>all</hi> things as it judges most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the <hi>publick good,</hi> where God hath <hi>not Countermanded,</hi> for the Power of Sovereigns de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending from God can <hi>only</hi> be <hi>limited</hi> by <hi>God</hi> or <hi>themselves</hi>; for if they are <hi>limitable</hi> by any <hi>other Power,</hi> they are Subjects to <hi>that Power,</hi> and so can no longer be <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> and if they are <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable</hi>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:58668:194"/>
only by <hi>God</hi> or <hi>themselves,</hi> then where they are <hi>not limited either</hi> by <hi>God</hi> or <hi>themselves,</hi> they must necessarily have a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>command.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The other <hi>unalienable</hi> Right that is derived to them from God is to be <hi>accountable only</hi> to <hi>God</hi>; for by deriving to them <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power God hath exalted them above <hi>all</hi> Powers, but his <hi>own,</hi> and therefore since <hi>no</hi> Power can be <hi>accountable</hi> but to a <hi>superiour</hi> Power, and since <hi>Sovereigns</hi> have <hi>no Superiour</hi> Power but <hi>God,</hi> it is to <hi>God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> from whom they received their Power, that they are <hi>accountable</hi> for the administration of it. These therefore are the <hi>natural Rights</hi> of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Powers, and these <hi>Rights</hi> remain <hi>intire</hi> and <hi>inviolate</hi> in them notwithstanding their <hi>subjection</hi> to the Mediatorial Scepter of our Saviour, as I shall endeavour to shew in the particulars.</p>
               <p>First, Therefore by this their <hi>subjection</hi> to Christ they are not <hi>deprived</hi> of their <hi>natural Right</hi> of Commanding in <hi>all cases</hi> as <hi>they</hi> shall judge most convenient for the <hi>publick Good,</hi> where <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>not countermanded</hi> them, For the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Religion is so far from any way <hi>retrenching</hi> the power of <hi>Princes,</hi> that it abundantly <hi>confirms</hi> and <hi>enforces</hi> it, by requiring us to <hi>submit to every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of man for the Lords sake,</hi> to <hi>be subject to the higher Powers,</hi> and that <hi>not only for wrath, but for conscience sake,</hi> to <hi>submit to Principalities and Powers, and to obey Magistrates,</hi> to <hi>render Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Custom to whom Custom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour, (i. e.)</hi> to submit to all the lawful impositions of our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether it be of Taxes, or of any other matter whatsoever, and in all the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:58668:194"/>
there is only <hi>one limitation</hi> made of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which is a <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> one, and that is that <hi>we ought to obey God rather than Man,</hi> that is, when <hi>Mans</hi> Command and <hi>Gods</hi> do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently <hi>clash</hi> and <hi>interfere</hi> with each other; for in this case the Magistrate hath <hi>no</hi> Right to be obeyed, because <hi>his Will</hi> is <hi>countermanded</hi> by a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Authority,</hi> by which <hi>Exception</hi> this general <hi>Rule</hi> is confirmed, that in all cases whatsoever, whether <hi>Temporal</hi> or <hi>Spiritual, Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> Sovereign Powers have an <hi>unalienable right</hi> to be obeyed. For if their Right to be obeyed in the Kingdom of Christ extended <hi>only</hi> to <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi> causes, their Authority would be very much <hi>lessened</hi> and <hi>Retrenched</hi> by their <hi>subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> to our Saviour; since <hi>before</hi> their subjection to him it undoubtedly extended to <hi>all causes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever</hi>; because being <hi>Sovereign</hi> under <hi>God,</hi> it could have no other <hi>bounds</hi> or <hi>limits</hi> but what <hi>God</hi> had set to it; and therefore since <hi>before</hi> their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Christ, God had <hi>bounded</hi> their Authority by no other <hi>Law</hi> but that of <hi>Nature,</hi> it must either be made appear that the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> did <hi>then limit</hi> their Authority only to <hi>Civil</hi> causes, (which I am sure is impossible) or it will necessarily follow that it extended also to <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> and if it did so <hi>then,</hi> it must do so <hi>still,</hi> unless it be made appear that <hi>Christianity</hi> hath <hi>retrenched</hi> and <hi>lessened it.</hi> It is true, Christ hath erected a <hi>standing form</hi> of <hi>spiritual Government</hi> in his Church, and it is as true that <hi>all Government,</hi> whether Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or Temporal, includes a <hi>Legislative Power</hi> in it, or a power of commanding its Subjects; but this is no <hi>limitation</hi> of the commanding power of
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:58668:195"/>

who in the <hi>defence</hi> of his <hi>Saviour</hi> resisted the High Priests Officers who came armed with a <hi>lawful</hi> Authority to seize and apprehend him; in which our Saviour <hi>plainly owns</hi> himself <hi>accountable</hi> to the <hi>Civil</hi> Authority of his Country: for if he had not been so, it could be no <hi>fault</hi> in S. <hi>Peter</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>rescue</hi> him from its Ministers, and if <hi>Christ himself,</hi> while he was upon Earth, were <hi>subject</hi> to the <hi>Civil</hi> Authority, what an high piece of arrogance is it for those who are at most but his <hi>Vicars</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> to claim or pretend an <hi>exemption?</hi> And if it were so great a <hi>fault</hi> in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to draw his Sword against <hi>lawful</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, though it were in the <hi>defence</hi> of his <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Person,</hi> then doubtless it is no less a <hi>fault</hi> in his <hi>Successors</hi> to pretend a Right from S. <hi>Peter</hi> to draw their Swords against Sovereign Princes, though it be in the <hi>defence</hi> of their <hi>Saviours Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> And as our Saviour <hi>owned</hi> himself subject and accountable to the <hi>Civil</hi> Tribunal, so S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s injunction is universal, <hi>Let every soul be subject to the higher Powers</hi>; and surely <hi>every Soul</hi> must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the whole body of the <hi>Clergy</hi> as well as of the <hi>Laity,</hi> unless we can produce some <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>express exception</hi> to the contrary, and as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand extends <hi>universally</hi> to all, so doth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it also, <hi>for the Powers that are, are ordained of God</hi>; and if we must be subject to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they rule by <hi>God's Authority,</hi> then it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there are none that are <hi>subject</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> but are under the force and obligation of this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And then he goes on, <hi>Whosoever resisteth the Power</hi> (of whatsoever Degree or Order of men he be) <hi>resisteth the Ordinance of God, and they that
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:58668:200"/>
resist shall receive to themselves damnation</hi>; and if, according to the Law of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> it be a <hi>damnable sin</hi> for any person or persons whatsoever to <hi>resist</hi> the <hi>Civil</hi> Authority, then it is a plain case, that our Saviour hath not at all <hi>depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> the Sovereignty of the <hi>Secular</hi> Powers by <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting</hi> it to any <hi>Superiour</hi> Tribunal; but hath left it as <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>unaccountable</hi> as ever it was <hi>before</hi> it was subjected to his Empire. And thus having proved that Sovereign Princes are not <hi>devested</hi> of any <hi>natural Right</hi> of their Sovereignty by their <hi>subjection</hi> to the <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Scepter of our Saviour, I proceed in the</p>
               <p>Second place, To shew what those <hi>Ministries</hi> are, which they are <hi>obliged</hi> to render to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our by vertue of this their <hi>subjection</hi> to him. In general it is foretold, that upon their <hi>Subjection</hi> to Christ they should become <hi>nursing Fathers and nursing Mothers</hi> to his Church, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.23. that is, that they should tenderly <hi>cherish, protect,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> it, and liberally minister to it whatsoever is necessary for its <hi>support</hi> and <hi>preservation</hi>; and to be sure Christ <hi>expects</hi> of them that they should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish this Prediction by doing all those <hi>good Offices</hi> to his Church which the relation of a <hi>foster Father</hi> or <hi>Mother</hi> imports: For when God <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts</hi> any good thing of men, it is plain that he would have them <hi>be</hi> what he <hi>foretels</hi> they <hi>shall be</hi>; so that in this case the <hi>Prophesie</hi> carries <hi>Precept</hi> in it, and doth not only signifie what <hi>shall be,</hi> but also what <hi>ought</hi> to be. When therefore God <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies</hi> of Kings that they shall be <hi>nursing Fathers</hi> to his <hi>Church,</hi> he doth as well declare what they <hi>should</hi> be as what they <hi>shall</hi> be; and so he <hi>foretels</hi>

of them, and <hi>commands</hi> them in the same breath. If therefore we would know what those <hi>Ministries</hi> are, which Christ now <hi>requires</hi> Sovereign Powers to render to his <hi>Church,</hi> our best way will be to inquire what those <hi>Duties</hi> are which are <hi>implied</hi> in the relation of a <hi>foster Father</hi> to his <hi>foster Child.</hi> Now the <hi>Duties</hi> of this Relation may be all of them comprehended under these four particulars:</p>
               <p>First, To <hi>protect</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> it against <hi>harms</hi> and <hi>injuries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, To <hi>Cultivate</hi> its manners with good <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Counsels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, To <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>chasten</hi> its <hi>faults</hi> and <hi>irregularities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, To supply it with decent <hi>Raiment</hi> and convenient <hi>Sustenance,</hi> answerable to which Sovereign Powers being constituted by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the <hi>foster Fathers</hi> of his Church are by vertue of this Relation <hi>obliged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. To <hi>protect</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> it in the Profession and exercise of the true Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">II. To <hi>fence</hi> and <hi>Cultivate</hi> its peace and good Order, either by wholesom <hi>Laws</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> or by permitting and requiring it to make good <hi>Laws</hi> for <hi>it self,</hi> and if need be, inforcing them with <hi>Civil Coercions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. To <hi>chasten</hi> and <hi>correct</hi> the irregular and disorderly members of it.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. To make provision for the <hi>Decency</hi> of its Worship, and for the convenient <hi>Maintenance</hi> of its <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> which answers to the decent <hi>Raiment</hi> and convenient <hi>Sustenance</hi> with which the <hi>Foster-Father</hi> is oblig'd to supply his <hi>Foster-Child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:58668:201"/>These Particulars I shall but very briefly insist on, it being none of my Province to instruct Princes and Governors.</p>
               <p n="1">I. One of those <hi>Ministries</hi> which Princes by virtue of their <hi>Subjection</hi> to Christ, are <hi>obliged</hi> to render to his Church, is to <hi>Protect</hi> and <hi>Defend</hi> her in the Profession and Exercise of the <hi>true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that is, not only to <hi>permit</hi> her openly to <hi>Profess</hi> the true Religion and to <hi>perform</hi> the publick <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of it without disturbance or interruption, but also to <hi>fence</hi> her with <hi>legal securities,</hi> and guard her with the <hi>Temporal Sword</hi> against the power and malice of such as would disturb and persecute her; and therefore Sovereign Powers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned above all things <hi>impartially</hi> to <hi>inquire</hi> and <hi>studiously</hi> to <hi>examine</hi> what the <hi>true Religion</hi> is, lest being imposed upon by false pretences, they <hi>misemploy</hi> that Power in the Patronage of <hi>Error,</hi> which was given 'em for the Protection of the <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Another of those <hi>Ministries</hi> which Princes are <hi>obliged,</hi> by virtue of their <hi>Subjection</hi> to Christ, to render his Church, is to Fence and Cultivate its <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>good Order,</hi> either by wholsom Laws of their <hi>own,</hi> or by permitting and requiring it when occasion requires to make good Laws for <hi>it self,</hi> and if need be, by inforcing 'em with <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Coercions:</hi> for so when the Church was either broken by <hi>Schisms</hi> or corrupted by <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>disorderly Customs</hi>; it was always the practice of Christian <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperors,</hi> even from the time that they became Christians to <hi>restrain</hi> and give a <hi>check</hi> to those <hi>Divisions</hi> and <hi>Disorders,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their <hi>own</hi> Royal and Imperial <hi>Edicts,</hi> or
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:58668:201"/>
by <hi>convening</hi> the Ecclesiastical Governors to Councils, there to consult and agree upon such good <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>expedients</hi> as the present necessities of the Church required; and because these Laws being grounded upon mere <hi>Spiritual Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> could as such be inforced by no other <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties</hi> than <hi>Spiritual,</hi> which by bold and obstinate Offenders were frequently <hi>despised</hi> and <hi>disregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> therefore those holy <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperours</hi> thought themselves <hi>obliged,</hi> as they were the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> of Jesus, to strengthen and reinforce 'em with <hi>temporal Sanctions</hi> and <hi>Penalties,</hi> by which means they became the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Church:</hi> Of all which I have given sufficient Instances, and all this was no more than what they were <hi>obliged</hi> to by vertue of their <hi>Subjection</hi> to Christ; for being <hi>subjected</hi> to him they are his <hi>Viceroys</hi> in the World, and do Reign and Govern by <hi>his</hi> Authority; and since <hi>their</hi> Authority is <hi>his,</hi> they must be <hi>accountable</hi> to him, if they do not imploy it <hi>for</hi> him in Ministring to the necessities of <hi>his Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi>; and therefore if when it is in their power to check a prevailing <hi>Schism</hi> or <hi>Corruption</hi> in the Church by wholsom <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Edicts,</hi> they refuse or neglect to do it, they must doubtless answer to him from whom they received their power, and who being himself the <hi>Supreme Head</hi> of the Church, hath constituted 'em its <hi>Guardians</hi> and <hi>Nursing-Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Another of those <hi>Ministries</hi> which Princes are <hi>obliged</hi> to render his Church is to Chasten and Correct the irregular and disorderly Members of it; for though there are Spiritual Rods and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:58668:202"/>
which Christ hath solely committed to the Spiritual Government, and which if men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood and considered the dire effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of 'em, are sufficient to restrain and keep in awe the most obstinate Offenders, yet when men are stupified in sin and do feel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but only what pains or pleases their bodies, these Spiritual Corrections are insignificant to 'em, they being such as make no impression on their corporeal Senses, and so when men are hardened in <hi>Schism</hi> or <hi>Heresie,</hi> to be sure they will despise the Ecclesiastical Rods, as being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently perswaded that they cannot be justly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to 'em, and that where they are applied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly they are only so many Spiritual scare-crows that can only threaten, but not hurt 'em; and therefore in these cases the Secular Powers are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by vertue of their Subjection to Jesus, to <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> the <hi>Spiritual</hi> with the Temporal Rod, and to awe such offenders with corporeal corrections as are fearless and insensible of the Censures of the Church. And conformable hereunto hath been the constant practice of all good Kings and Emperors, even from their first Conversion to Christianity, as might easily be demonstrated by innumerable Instances out of Ecclesiastical History; for they not only made Laws inforc'd with <hi>temporal</hi> Penalties for the regulation of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as well as <hi>Laity,</hi> not only commanded and obliged their <hi>Bishops</hi> in case of notorious neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to execute the Church Censures on the Schismatical, Heretical and disorderly of both sorts; but when they found those <hi>Spiritual</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions <hi>ineffectual,</hi> they very often <hi>seconded</hi> 'em
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:58668:202"/>
with <hi>temporal,</hi> such as pecuniary mulcts, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments and Banishments; and though in the case of <hi>error</hi> and <hi>false belief</hi> they were always very tender and gentle, yet whenever they found men <hi>busily propagating</hi> their <hi>Errors</hi> into <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Divisions,</hi> to the disturbance of the Churches peace, they thought themselves obliged to restrain their petulancy with <hi>temporal Chastisements.</hi> And indeed as they are the Vice-roys of our Saviour they are <hi>ex officio</hi> the conservators of the peace of his Kingdom, and stand <hi>obliged</hi> to exert that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he hath devolved upon 'em in the defence of its <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>good Order,</hi> which in many cases they can no otherwise do, but only by restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Schismatical and disorderly with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>temporal corrections,</hi> so that as well in the Church as in the Civil State they are the <hi>Ministers of God to us for our good,</hi> and therefore if we <hi>do that which is evil,</hi> we have just cause to <hi>be affraid, for they bear not the Sword in vain, for they are the Ministers of God, Revengers to execute wrath upon them that do evil,</hi> Rom. 13.14.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And lastly, Another of those <hi>Ministries</hi> which Princes are <hi>obliged</hi> to render to Christ's Church by vertue of their subjection to him, is to make <hi>good provision</hi> for the <hi>Decency</hi> of its Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and for the <hi>convenient maintenance</hi> of its Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Ministers; to take care that it hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and commodious <hi>places</hi> set apart for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Celebration of its Worship, and that those <hi>places</hi> be supplied with such <hi>Ornaments</hi> and <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations</hi> as are sutable to those <hi>venerable Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi> that are to be performed in them; that so its Worship may not be exposed to <hi>contempt</hi> by
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:58668:203"/>
the <hi>slovenliness</hi> and <hi>Barbarity</hi> of its outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages; and this is the <hi>clothing</hi> of the Church, which as it ought not on the one hand to be too <hi>Pompous</hi> and <hi>Gaudy,</hi> that being naturally apt to <hi>distract</hi> and <hi>Carnalize</hi> the minds of its Votaries, and to <hi>divert</hi> their attention from those <hi>spiritual</hi> exercises, wherein the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> of its Worship consists; so neither ought it on the other hand to be <hi>sordid</hi> and <hi>nasty,</hi> that being as naturally apt to <hi>prejudice</hi> and <hi>distaste</hi> men against it, and to create in their minds a <hi>loathing</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> of it. Now the furnishing the Church with such decent <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Ornaments</hi> of Worship, as do <hi>become</hi> the grave Solemnities of a <hi>spiritual Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> being a matter of Cost and Charge must necessarily belong to the <hi>Civil</hi> Powers who alone can lay Rates upon the Subject, and have the sole Command and disposal of the <hi>publick Purse</hi>; and therefore by vertue of their <hi>subjection</hi> to Christ, they are <hi>obliged</hi> to take care that such Religious <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Ornaments</hi> be provided as the <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>convenience</hi> of his Worship do require. And then as for the <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> of his Church they are under the <hi>same Obligation</hi> to take care, that they whose Office it is to <hi>serve at the Altar should live upon the Altar,</hi> and that according to the different stations and degrees wherein they are placed, that so they may neither be <hi>necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> for a subsistence to involve themselves in <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affairs,</hi> and thereby to neglect their <hi>spiritual Calling,</hi> which is Burthen enough of all conscience for any <hi>one</hi> mans shoulders, nor be tempted to <hi>base Compliances</hi> with the lusts of men and the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of times for a maintenance; and that so Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:58668:203"/>
it self may not be exposed to <hi>contempt</hi> through their wretched <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>indigence</hi> who are the Ministers of it, and who for want of a fair and honourable <hi>subsistence</hi> can never obtain <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> enough to do any considerable good in the World. And this is the <hi>food</hi> and <hi>sustenance</hi> of the Church, without which it cannot long flourish either in true <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or true <hi>Piety,</hi> but must insensibly wither away, and degenerate into <hi>Barbarity</hi> and <hi>Ignorance.</hi> And accordingly, if you consult Ecclesiastical History you will find that it was ever the practice of <hi>Pious</hi> Princes and Emperors to take care both for the erecting of <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>convenient Churches</hi> in all parts of their Dominions for the Celebration of Divine Worship, and to furnish them with all the <hi>decent Accommodations</hi> and <hi>Ornaments</hi> that were proper thereunto, and also for the endowing the Bishops and Pastors of the Church with such <hi>honourable subsistences</hi> as becomes the Port and Dignity of their several <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi>; in which they did no more than what they stood <hi>obliged</hi> to, as they were the <hi>Viceroys</hi> of Jesus, and the <hi>foster Fathers</hi> of his Church, by vertue of which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to it they are bound in <hi>duty</hi> to supply it with decent <hi>Raiment</hi> and convenient <hi>Food.</hi> And now having explained the <hi>subjection</hi> of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Powers of the Earth to our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and shewn <hi>what</hi> those <hi>Ministries</hi> are which they are <hi>obliged</hi> to render to him in his Kingdom, I proceed to the</p>
               <p>Fourth and last sort of his <hi>Ministers,</hi> by which he governs his Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical Governours,</hi> in treating of which I shall endeavor these three things:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:58668:204"/>First, To shew that Christ hath erected a <hi>spiritual Government</hi> to minister to him in his Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To shew in what hands this <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Government</hi> is placed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To shew what are the proper <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries</hi> of this <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. That Christ hath erected a <hi>spiritual Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in his Church. And indeed, supposing the Church to be a <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>formed</hi> Society, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of it <hi>self, distinct</hi> from all other Societies, it must necessarily have a <hi>distinct Government</hi> in it, because <hi>Government</hi> is <hi>essentially</hi> included in the very notion of all <hi>regular</hi> Society, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> is not a formed <hi>Society,</hi> but a confused <hi>multitude</hi>; for what else do we mean by a <hi>Humane Society,</hi> but only such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men <hi>united</hi> together by such and such <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Regulations?</hi> But how can any compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men be <hi>united</hi> by <hi>Laws,</hi> without having in it some <hi>Governing</hi> Power to <hi>rule</hi> by those Laws, and exact <hi>obedience</hi> to them? So that we may as well suppose a compleat <hi>Body</hi> without a <hi>Head,</hi> as a <hi>Regular Society</hi> without a <hi>Government.</hi> Now that the Church is a <hi>Regular Society,</hi> utterly <hi>distinct</hi> from all Civil Society, is as evident as the truth of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which all along declares and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizes the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> upon which it is <hi>founded,</hi> and by which it is <hi>united,</hi> to be <hi>Divine,</hi> and consequently to be <hi>superior</hi> to, and <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> upon all <hi>Civil Laws</hi>; and if that which constitutes the Church be <hi>Divine</hi> Law and not <hi>Civil,</hi> then the Constitution of the Church must be <hi>Divine</hi> and not <hi>Civil:</hi> for that which
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:58668:204"/>
makes us <hi>Christians,</hi> at the same time makes us <hi>parts</hi> of the Christian <hi>Church</hi>; and that which makes all the <hi>parts</hi> of the Church makes the Church <hi>it self</hi>; which is nothing but the <hi>whole,</hi> or <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>parts</hi> together; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we are not made <hi>Christians,</hi> so neither are we made a Christian <hi>Church</hi> by the Laws of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> but by the Laws and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which were promulgated to the World long <hi>before</hi> there were any Laws of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> to found a Christian Church on; for there was a Christian <hi>Church</hi> for three hundred years together <hi>before</hi> ever it had the least favour or protection from the Laws of <hi>Nations.</hi> In all which time it subsisted <hi>apart</hi> from all other <hi>Societies,</hi> and was as much a <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Christian Society</hi> as it is now; and as it is now it is only a continued <hi>Succession</hi> of <hi>that Primitive Church,</hi> and therefore, as to the Constitution of it, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be as <hi>distinct now</hi> from all other Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as it was <hi>then,</hi> when it subsisted not only <hi>apart from,</hi> but <hi>against</hi> the Laws and Edicts of all other Societies in the World; in short therefore, since the Church of Christ is founded on a <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>incorporated</hi> by a <hi>Law</hi> that is utterly <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> from the Charters and Laws of all <hi>Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,</hi> it hence necessarily follows, that it self is a <hi>distinct Society</hi> from them all; because that which <hi>individuates</hi> any Society, or makes it a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> body from all other Societies, is the <hi>Charter</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> upon which it is founded; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly our Saviour tells <hi>Pilate</hi> when he asked him whether he was a <hi>King,</hi> that he was a <hi>King</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but that <hi>his Kingdom was not of this world,</hi>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:58668:205"/>
Joh. 18.36. <hi>i. e.</hi> though my Kingdom be <hi>in</hi> this World, yet is it not <hi>of</hi> the World; for neither are the <hi>Laws</hi> of it <hi>Humane</hi> but <hi>Divine,</hi> nor the <hi>powers</hi> of it <hi>external</hi> but <hi>invisible,</hi> nor the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> of it <hi>temporal</hi> but <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the whole therefore these two things are evident;</p>
               <p>First, That <hi>Government</hi> is <hi>Essential</hi> to <hi>formed</hi> and <hi>regular Societies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Church of Christ is in the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of it a <hi>formed</hi> and <hi>regular Society, distinct</hi> from all other Societies: from both which it necessarily followeth, that it must have a <hi>distinct Government</hi> included in the very <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>being</hi> of it. And accordingly in the New Testament besides the <hi>Civil</hi> Magistrates, we frequently read of <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Governors, so <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. there is mention made of the Rulers that <hi>watch for our souls,</hi> and a strict injunction to <hi>obey</hi> and <hi>submit our selves to 'em</hi>; and so again in the 7th. and 24th. Verses, and in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. The Apostle speaks of <hi>the Elders that Rule well</hi> who are to be <hi>accounted worthy of double Honour.</hi> And indeed the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">

shall make yet more fully appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when I come to treat of the several <hi>Ministries</hi> which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church of Christ are <hi>obliged</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.</p>
               <p>I proceed therefore at present to the Second thing proposed, which was to inquire into the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>this Government in what hands Christ hath placed it; now the two main Rival forms of Church Government pretending to divine Institution are the Presbyterial and Episcopal; the Presbyterial is that which is seated in an equality or parity of Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, the Episcopal is that which is placed in a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior order of Church Officers, called Bishops; to whom the other Orders of Presbyters and Deacons are subject and subordinate: the latter of which I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove, is the true form of Government institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Saviour, and that</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, from the <hi>Institution</hi> of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From the practice of the Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From the punctual conformity of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church to both.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, From our <hi>Saviours</hi> declared <hi>allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> and <hi>approbation</hi> of the Primitive <hi>practice</hi> in this matter.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That the <hi>Government</hi> of the Church of Christ is <hi>Episcopal,</hi> is evident from the <hi>Institution</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who in his life-time instituted two <hi>distinct Orders</hi> of Ecclesiastical Ministers, the one superiour to the other, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the twelve <hi>Apostles,</hi> and that of the seventy or seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two <hi>Disciples</hi>; for that these two were of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Orders,</hi> is evident from their being always distinguished from one another and mentioned
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:58668:206"/>
apart by different <hi>names</hi> and in different <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Classes</hi>; for to what purpose should the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture mention the twelve and the seventy so <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly</hi> as it every where doth, if there were not some distinction in their <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Employment,</hi> for in <hi>Luke</hi> 6.13. we are told that Christ <hi>called unto him his Disciples, and of them he chose twelve, whom also be named Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> 3.13, 14. it is said that <hi>he called unto him whom he would,</hi> that is, of his Disciples, <hi>and ordained twelve that they should be with him and that he might send 'em forth to Preach,</hi> and what less can this imply than that the twelve were separated by this <hi>Call</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> of Christ to some distinct Office and Employment from the rest of the Disciples. And that the Office of the <hi>twelve</hi> was <hi>superiour</hi> to that of the <hi>seventy,</hi> is evident not only from their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still placed <hi>first</hi> in the Catalogues of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Officers, see <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. in the latter of which we are told that <hi>God constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Church, first Apostles</hi> wherein the <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is attributed to the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Office; and not only from the <hi>particular</hi> care which Christ took of these twelve above the rest of his Disciples both in praying for and instructing them, of which there are a great many notorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in the Gospels, but also from hence that their immediate <hi>Successors</hi> were for the most part <hi>Chosen</hi> out of the seventy; for so <hi>Simeon</hi> the Son of <hi>Cleophas</hi> succeeded S. <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem, Philip</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Caesarea, Clement</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and divers others of the seventy according to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotheus, Eusebius</hi> and others of the Fathers <hi>succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> the Apostles after their death in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:58668:207"/>
of their several Churches, and <hi>Matthias,</hi> who as <hi>Eusebius Epiphanius</hi> and S. <hi>Ierom</hi> affirm, was one of the seventy that was <hi>Chosen</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> by the other Apostles to <hi>succeed Iudas</hi> in the Apostolate, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.26. from whence it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that the Apostles were <hi>superiour</hi> to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty, otherwise it would have been no <hi>advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to the seventy to <hi>succeed</hi> 'em; for all that <hi>Superiority</hi> which they acquired by their <hi>Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> must necessarily be <hi>inherent</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they succeeded 'em; else how can they be said to succeed 'em in it? and if we suppose 'em to be <hi>equal</hi> with the Apostles in <hi>Office</hi> before they suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded 'em, it is nonsense to say they <hi>succeeded</hi> 'em; for how can a man be said to <hi>succeed another</hi> in any <hi>Office</hi> who is actually vested with the <hi>same Office</hi> before he succeeds him. If therefore the seventy received no <hi>more</hi> power <hi>after</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, than they had under 'em, they were <hi>as much</hi> Apostles <hi>before</hi> they succeeded 'em, as <hi>after</hi>; but if they did receive <hi>more</hi> power, then the <hi>Apostles</hi> to whom they succeeded had <hi>more</hi> power than <hi>they</hi> before they received it, and consequently were <hi>their Super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ours,</hi> because a man can <hi>receive</hi> no more power by <hi>succeeding</hi> another in any <hi>Office,</hi> than he to whom he succeeds had before, by vertue of the <hi>same Office.</hi> By all which it is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that by the <hi>Institution</hi> of our Saviour the <hi>Apostles</hi> were <hi>superiour</hi> to the <hi>seventy,</hi> and yet it is as evident that the seventy were <hi>Ecclesiastical Ministers,</hi> as well as they; for in <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1. we are told that <hi>after these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent 'em two and two before his face,</hi> that is, to Preach his Gospel, and that
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:58668:207"/>
by this Mission of his they were <hi>authorized</hi> to be the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Religion, is evident from what he tells 'em, Verse 16. <hi>he that heareth you heareth me, and he that despiseth you despiseth me, and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me</hi>; from whence it is plain that they were <hi>his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Ministers,</hi> even as he was <hi>Gods,</hi> because as the despising of <hi>him</hi> was a despising of <hi>God,</hi> by whom he was sent; so the despising of <hi>them</hi> was a despising of <hi>Christ,</hi> by whom <hi>they</hi> were sent; and accordingly by vertue of this Mission we find 'em acting as <hi>Authorized Ministers</hi> of the Gospel; for so <hi>Ananias,</hi> who was one of 'em, Baptized <hi>Saul, Acts</hi> 9.18. and <hi>Philip</hi> who was another Preached and Baptized at <hi>Samaria. Acts</hi> 8.5.</p>
               <p>So that here are plainly <hi>two</hi> sorts of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical <hi>Officers,</hi> the one superiour to the other, of our Saviours <hi>own Institution</hi> and <hi>appointment</hi>; and therefore if <hi>his institution</hi> be still valid, there must still be a <hi>superiority</hi> and <hi>subordination</hi> between the Officers and Ministers of his Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Government thereof must still be <hi>Episcopal, i. e.</hi> by some <hi>superiour Officers</hi> presiding and superintending over other inferiour <hi>ones.</hi> I know it is objected that <hi>this superiority</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles over the seventy was only in <hi>Office</hi> but not in <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Iurisdiction</hi>; but since it is the <hi>Office</hi> that is the immediate Subject of the <hi>Power</hi> belonging to it, I would fain know, whether superiority of <hi>Office</hi> must not necessarily include superiority in <hi>Power</hi>; for <hi>Office</hi> without <hi>Power</hi> is an empty name that signifies nothing, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree of superiority of <hi>Office</hi> must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Power</hi> to exert it self in Acts of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:58668:208"/>
superiority; otherwise 'twill be utterly in vain and to no purpose. So that either the <hi>superiority</hi> of the Apostolick Office over <hi>other</hi> Church-Offices must be void and insignificant, or it must have a proportionable superiority of <hi>power</hi> over 'em inseparably <hi>inherent</hi> in it. But it is farther object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that supposing the Apostolate to be <hi>superiour</hi> to the other Ecclesiastical Orders in <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> yet it was but <hi>temporary,</hi> it being institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Saviour in subservience to the <hi>present exigence</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> of things, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of deriving it down to the Church in a continued <hi>Succession.</hi> To which I answer in short, that this is said without so much as a plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble colour of reason; for they allow both that our Saviour <hi>instituted</hi> this Office, and that in his institution he never gave the least intimation to the World that he <hi>intended</hi> it only for a <hi>certain season.</hi> Now if men will presume to declare Christs <hi>Institutions Temporary,</hi> without producing the <hi>least intimation</hi> of his Will, that he so design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 'em, they may with the <hi>same</hi> warrant repeal <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Institutions</hi> of Christianity; and even the two <hi>Sacraments</hi> will lie as much at their mercy as the Institution of the <hi>Apostolick Order,</hi> which unless they can prove it repealed by the <hi>same</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which established it, will be sufficient to prescribe to all <hi>Ages</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi>; for the <hi>obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of divine Commands are <hi>dissolvable</hi> only by divine <hi>countermands</hi>; and for <hi>men</hi> to declare any divine Institution void before <hi>God</hi> hath so decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it; is to <hi>over-rule</hi> the Will of <hi>God</hi> by their own arrogant <hi>Presumptions,</hi> for though the <hi>matter</hi> of the Institution be mutable in it <hi>self,</hi> yet the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:58668:208"/>
                  <hi>form</hi> and <hi>obligation</hi> of it is mutable only by the <hi>authority</hi> which <hi>made</hi> it; and therefore though God hath not declared that he instituted it for <hi>perpetuity,</hi> yet till he declares the <hi>contrary,</hi> it must bind for perpetuity; especially if the <hi>reason</hi> of the institution of it be not apparently <hi>altered,</hi> which cannot be pretended in the case under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, there being the very <hi>same reasons</hi> for a <hi>supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority</hi> and <hi>subordination</hi> between Ecclesiastick Officers <hi>now,</hi> as there was when our Saviour <hi>first appointed</hi> and <hi>instituted</hi> it. Until therefore they can shew either that the <hi>reason</hi> of the institution is <hi>ceast,</hi> or that the institution it <hi>self</hi> is <hi>repeal'd</hi> by some other Law; (neither of which was ever yet pretended,) they may as reasonably dispence with most of the <hi>precepts</hi> of the Gospel (which are no more declared <hi>perpetual</hi> than <hi>this</hi>) as with this of <hi>superiority</hi> and <hi>subjection</hi> among the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Orders, which is the proper form of the Episcopal Government.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That the true Government of the Church is <hi>Episcopal,</hi> is evident also from the <hi>Practice</hi> of the holy <hi>Apostles,</hi> who pursuant to the institution of our Saviour, did not only <hi>exercise</hi> that <hi>superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in their <hi>own</hi> persons which their Office gave 'em over their inferiour Clergy, but also <hi>derived</hi> it down with their Office to their <hi>Successors,</hi> which is a plain argument that they looked upon our Saviours institution of this superiour Office of the Apostolate, not as a <hi>temporary expedient,</hi> but as a <hi>standing form</hi> of Ecclesiastical Government, to be handed down to all <hi>succeeding Generations:</hi> for though during our Saviours abode upon Earth and sometime after his ascension into Heaven, the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:58668:209"/>
number of the Apostles was confined to <hi>twelve,</hi> yet when afterwards, thro their Ministry the Church was spread and dilated not only through <hi>Iudea,</hi> but into the <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations, they added to their number several <hi>other Apostles</hi> to whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the <hi>same Office</hi> and <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> over the other Clergy, that our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had communicated to <hi>them,</hi> for so <hi>Eusebius lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> besides the twelve there were many <hi>other Apostles</hi> in that Age after the similitude of the <hi>twelve</hi>; and of the truth of this I shall give three or four instances.</p>
               <p>The first is that of S. <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Iesus,</hi> who though he was none of the <hi>Twelve,</hi> (for in that number there were but two <hi>Iameses, viz.</hi> the Son of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> and the Son of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> neither of which was he, whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>Lords Brother,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons him apart from the Twelve, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5, 6.7.) is yet stiled an Apostle by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 1.19. <hi>but other Apostles saw I none save</hi> James <hi>the Lords Brother.</hi> And S. <hi>Ierom</hi> in his Comment on <hi>Isaiah</hi> stiles <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>thirteenth Apostle,</hi> that is, the first that was made an Apostle after the Twelve, and that he was not merely a <hi>nominal</hi> Apostle, but <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> endowed with Apostolical <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority,</hi> is evident both from <hi>Scripture</hi> and the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous consent of Ecclesiastical <hi>History:</hi> from <hi>Scripture</hi> it is evident that this <hi>Iames</hi> was a man of great preheminence in the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; for in the first Council that was held there we find him giving a discisive Sentence in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Circumcision, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. for after there
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:58668:209"/>
had been <hi>much disputing, ver.</hi> 7. and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>Barnabas</hi> had declared their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the case, <hi>ver.</hi> 7.13. S. <hi>Iames</hi> after a short Preface thus delivers himself, <hi>Wherefore my Sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles are turned unto God,</hi> and this Sentence of his determines the Controversie, and puts a final end to all farther debate, which plainly argues his great authority and preheminence in that place. Again <hi>Acts</hi> 21.17, 18. we are told, that when S. <hi>Paul</hi> and his company <hi>were come to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, the Brethren received him gladly, and that the next day following</hi> Paul <hi>went in with them unto</hi> James, <hi>and all the Elders were present.</hi> Now for what other reason should <hi>Paul</hi> go in to <hi>Iames</hi> more especially, or upon what other account should all the Elders be present with <hi>Iames,</hi> but that he was a person of the <hi>greatest note</hi> and <hi>figure</hi> in the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and for the same reason in all probability S. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions <hi>Iames</hi> before <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> discoursing of a meeting he had with them at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Gal. 2.9. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause though <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were two of the Principal of the twelve Apostles, and S. <hi>Iames</hi> was not so much as one of that number, yet in the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> he had the <hi>Priority</hi> of them <hi>both</hi>; now considering that S. <hi>Iames</hi> is called an <hi>Apostle,</hi> and considering the <hi>Preference</hi> he had in all these instances <hi>above</hi> the other Apostles at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> it is at least highly <hi>probable</hi> that he was <hi>peculiarly</hi> the Apostle of the Church of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>; but if to all this evidence we add the most early Testimonies of Christian Antiquity, we shall advance the <hi>Probability</hi> to a <hi>Demonstration</hi>;
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:58668:210"/>
for by the unanimous consent of all Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Writers S. <hi>Iames</hi> was the first Bishop of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> for so <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> who lived very near the times of the Apostles, tells us, that <hi>Iames</hi> the Brother of our Lord, called by all men <hi>the Iust,</hi> received the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>vid. Euseb. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 23. so also S. <hi>Clement,</hi> as he is quoted by the same Author, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. tells us, that <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> after the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of Christ, as being the men that were most in favour with him, did not contend for the Honour, but chose <hi>Iames</hi> the Just to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; and in the <hi>Apostolical Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi> that pass under the name of S. <hi>Clement,</hi> (which though not so ancient as is pretended, yet are doubtless of very early Antiquity) the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles are brought in thus speaking, <hi>Concerning those that were ordained by us Bishops in our life time, we signifie to you that they were these, Iames the Brother of our Lord was Ordained by us Bishop of Ierusalem,</hi> &amp;c. so also S. <hi>Ierom. de script. Eccles.</hi> tells us, that S. <hi>Iames,</hi> immediately after the Passion of our Lord, was ordained Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the <hi>Apostles.</hi> And S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> who was afterwards Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of that Church, and therefore a most Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Witness of the Records of it, calls Saint <hi>Iames the first Bishop of that Diocess, Catech.</hi> 16. To all which we have the concurrent Testimonies of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostom, Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and a great many others; and S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who was an <hi>immediate Disciple</hi> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, makes S. <hi>Stephen</hi> to be a Deacon of S. <hi>Iames, Ep. ad Trall.</hi> and therefore since <hi>Stephen</hi> was a Deacon of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> S. <hi>Iames,</hi>
                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:58668:210"/>
whose Deacon he was, must necessarily be the Bishop of it.</p>
               <p>Upon this account therefore S. <hi>Iames</hi> is called an <hi>Apostle</hi> in Scripture, because by being Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Apostles Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he had the <hi>Apostolick Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> conferred on him, for since it is apparent he was none of the Twelve, to whom the Apostleship was at <hi>first</hi> confined, he could no otherwise become an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,</hi> than by deriving the Apostleship from some of the <hi>Twelve,</hi> and therefore since that Apostleship, which he derived from the Twelve, was only <hi>Episcopal Superiority</hi> over the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it hence necessarily follows that the <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was the <hi>Apostleship</hi> derived and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from the Primitive Apostles.</p>
               <p>The second Instance of the Apostles Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating their Apostolick Superiority to others is <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> who in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.25. is stiled the <hi>Apostle</hi> of the <hi>Philippians, But I suppose it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my Brother and companion in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and fellow souldier, <gap reason="foreign">

with Episcopal Government as being their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; so that here you see <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> is made an Apostle by the Apostles, and his <hi>Apostleship</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in being made <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Philippi.</hi>

                     </gap>, the Apostles of the Churches, and the glory of Christ,</hi> where it is plain they are not called the <hi>Apostles of the Churches</hi> merely as they were the Messengers of the liberality of the Churches of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> for it was not those <hi>Churches,</hi> but S. <hi>Paul</hi> that sent them, <hi>vers.</hi> 22. and therefore since they were not <hi>Apostles</hi> in relation to those <hi>Churches</hi> whose liberality they carried, it must be in relation to some <hi>particular</hi> Churches over which they had <hi>Apostolical Authority</hi>; and that <hi>Titus</hi> had this Authority over the Church of <hi>Crete,</hi> is evident both from S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle to him, and from Primitive Antiquity: As for Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle, there are sundry passages in it, which plainly speak him to be vested with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Superiority over that Church; so Chap. 1. vers. 5. <hi>For this cause left I thee in</hi> Crete <hi>that thou shouldst set things in order that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City as I have appointed thee.</hi> For in the first place, S. <hi>Paul</hi> here gives him the <hi>supreme</hi> judgment of things that were wanting, with an <hi>absolute</hi> power to <hi>reform</hi> and <hi>correct</hi> them; which is a plain demonstration of his <hi>Superiority</hi> in that Church. Secondly, he Authorizes him to <hi>ordain Elders in every City,</hi> and whether these Elders were <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:58668:211"/>
is of very little consequence as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent debate; for first it is of undoubted certainty that there were Presbyters in the Church of <hi>Crete,</hi> before <hi>Titus</hi> was left there by the Apostle; and secondly, it is as evident that those Presbyters had no Power to <hi>ordain Elders in every City,</hi> as <hi>Titus</hi> had; for if they had, what needed S. <hi>Paul</hi> to have left <hi>Titus</hi> there for that purpose? What need he have left <hi>Titus</hi> there with a <hi>new power</hi> to do that which the <hi>Presbyters</hi> before him had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power to do? For if the <hi>Presbyters</hi> had before the power of <hi>Ordination</hi> in them, this <hi>new</hi> power of <hi>Titus's</hi> would have been not only in <hi>vain,</hi> but <hi>mischievous</hi>; it would have look'd like an <hi>invasion</hi> of the Power of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> for S. <hi>Paul</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain Ordination to <hi>Titus,</hi> if before him it had been common to the <hi>whole Presbytery</hi>; and upon that account have rather proved an occasion of <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>contention</hi> than an expedient of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>good order.</hi> From hence therefore it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>Titus</hi> had a <hi>Power</hi> in the Church of <hi>Crete</hi> which the <hi>Presbyters</hi> there before him <hi>had not,</hi> and this Power of his extended not only to the establishment of <hi>good Order</hi> and the <hi>Ordaining</hi> of Elders, but also to <hi>rebuking with all authority, i. e.</hi> correcting obstinate offenders with the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Rod of Excommunication, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 15. and taking cognisance of Heretical Pravity, so as first <hi>to admonish Hereticks,</hi> and in case of Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy to <hi>reject</hi> them from the Communion of the Church, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 10. from all which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that this <hi>Apostolate</hi> of <hi>Titus</hi> consisted in his Ecclesiastical <hi>Superiority,</hi> which was the very <hi>same</hi> in the Church of <hi>Crete</hi> that the first Apostles
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:58668:212"/>
themselves had in the several Churches that were planted by them. And accordingly he is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the concurrent Testimony of all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to be the <hi>first</hi> Bishop of that Church; so <hi>Euseb. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. affirms him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to have received Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Authority over the Churches of <hi>Crete.</hi> So also <hi>Theodoret.</hi> in <hi>Argum. Ep. ad Tit.</hi> tells us, that he was ordained by S. <hi>Paul</hi> Bishop of <hi>Crete,</hi> and so also S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> and S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and several others of the Fathers and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Writers. This Episcopal Authority therefore which S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave <hi>Titus</hi> over the Church of <hi>Crete</hi> is another plain instance of the Apostles making Apostles, or deriving to <hi>others</hi> their <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Power</hi> and <hi>Superiority</hi> over particular Churches.</p>
               <p>The fourth and last Instance I shall give is that of <hi>Timothy,</hi> who as it appears by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles to him, had <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority over the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi>; and this not only over the <hi>Laity</hi> to <hi>command and teach 'em,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.11. to receive Widows into the Churches Service or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and refuse 'em, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.4.9.16. and to oblige the Women to go modestly in their Apparel and keep silence in the Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12. but also over the <hi>Clergy,</hi> to take care that sutable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision should be made for 'em, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. that none should be admitted a Deacon till after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent trial, nor Ordained an Elder, till after he had well acquitted himself in the Deaconship, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10.13. to exercise Ecclesiastical Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over 'em, to receive Accusations against 'em, and if he found 'em guilty to put 'em to
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:58668:212"/>
open shame, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19, 20. and S. <hi>Paul</hi> charges him to exercise this his Jurisdiction <hi>without prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one before another, and without partiality, ibid. ver.</hi> 21. which if he had no Jurisdiction over 'em, had been very impertinent; and as he had Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction over the <hi>Clergy concredited</hi> to him, so had he also the Authority of <hi>Ordaining</hi> 'em; for the due exercise of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives him that necessary rule, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other mens sins.</hi> And that this <hi>Authority</hi> of his in the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Church over both the <hi>Laity</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> was given by S. <hi>Paul</hi> for a <hi>standing form</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> there, is evident from hence, because it was conferred on him after the <hi>Presbytery</hi> was formed and setled in that Church; for in planting and cultivating this <hi>large</hi> and <hi>populous Church</hi> which extended it self over all the Proconsular <hi>Asia,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for three years together with incredible diligence; which is a much longer time than he spent in any other Church, and therefore by this time to be sure he had not only <hi>constituted</hi> a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> in it, as he did in all other Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. but also reduced it to much greater <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> than any other, that so in the <hi>constitution</hi> of it, it might be a pattern to all other Churches; and if so, then to be sure the Government which he had <hi>now</hi> at last <hi>established</hi> in it was such as he intended should <hi>continue, viz.</hi> by a <hi>single Person</hi> presiding over both <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity.</hi> And that <hi>de facto</hi> it was so, we have not only the Authority of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> but also the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Testimony of all Ecclesiastical Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for so <hi>Euseb.</hi> Eccles. Hist. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. tells us
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:58668:213"/>
                  <hi>he was the first Bishop of the Province</hi> or Diocess of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and the Anonimous Author of his life in <hi>Photius,</hi> that <hi>he was the first that acted as Bishop in</hi> Ephesus, and that <hi>he was Ordained and Enthroned Bishop of the Metropolis of</hi> Ephesus <hi>by the great</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi>; and in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> twenty seven Bishops are said to have succeeded in that Chair from <hi>Timothy</hi> who was the first, and Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> Hom. 15. in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. tells us <hi>that it is manifest</hi> Timothy <hi>was intrusted with a Church, or rather with a whole Nation,</hi> viz. <hi>that of</hi> Asia, upon which account he is stiled by <hi>Theodoret</hi> in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Timothy</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of the <hi>Asiatiques,</hi> and (to name no more of the great numbers of Authorities that might be cited) in the <hi>Apostolical Constitutions</hi> we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly told, that he was <hi>Ordained Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> by S. <hi>Paul.</hi> This therefore is <hi>another</hi> evident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Apostles <hi>deriving</hi> down their <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick</hi> Authority. Other instances might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but these are sufficient to shew that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> did not look upon our Saviours <hi>institution</hi> of a <hi>superiour</hi> Order of Ecclesiastical Officers, as a <hi>temporary</hi> thing that was to expire with 'em, but as a <hi>standing Model</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Government,</hi> since they derived to <hi>others</hi> that <hi>superiority</hi> over the Churches of Christ which he communicated to <hi>them.</hi> For from all these instances it is most evident, both that the <hi>Apostolical Office</hi> did not expire with the Twelve, but was <hi>transferred</hi> by 'em to <hi>others,</hi> and that that which is now called the <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was nothing else but the <hi>Apostolical Office</hi> derived from the <hi>Apostles</hi> to their <hi>successors:</hi> for in the Primitive Language of the Church, <hi>Bishops</hi>

               <p n="3">III. That the true <hi>Government</hi> of the Church is <hi>Episcopal,</hi> is evident also from the <hi>Universal</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church thereunto. It is objected by the Adversaries of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that though our <hi>Saviour</hi> indeed Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a <hi>superior Order</hi> of Church Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> his Twelve <hi>Apostles</hi> to precide over the rest, and Govern his Church, yet this was an <hi>extraordinary Commission</hi> which he never intended they should <hi>derive</hi> down to the Church as a <hi>perpetual Model</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> but was limited to the persons of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and was to expire with 'em. Now that it was <hi>not</hi> limited to the persons of the <hi>Apostles</hi> is evident, since as it hath been shewn before, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <hi>derived</hi> it to <hi>others</hi>; which they could not have done without <hi>violating</hi> their trust, and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi> the bounds of their <hi>Commission,</hi> had it been <hi>appropriated</hi> to their persons, so that it must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed either that they proceeded <hi>irregularly</hi> in <hi>transferring</hi> their superiority to others; or that their Commission <hi>did</hi> impower them to <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> it; and therefore if it appear not only that they <hi>might transfer</hi> it to <hi>some</hi> for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:58668:214"/>
of <hi>some</hi> Churches, by vertue of their <hi>Commission</hi> (of which the above cited instances are a full demonstration) but also that they U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally <hi>transferred</hi> it to <hi>others</hi> for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all <hi>other</hi> Churches, then it is certain that either they <hi>mistook</hi> the intent of our Saviours Commission, or the intent of it <hi>was</hi> to impower 'em to transfer it unversally as a <hi>standing</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual</hi> Form of <hi>Ecclesiastical Government</hi>; in short, if they understood the <hi>intendment</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> Commission (as to be sure they did being <hi>guided by the Spirit into all Truth</hi>) to be sure they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have communicated their <hi>Apostolick Superiority</hi> to any, had it not been our Saviours <hi>intention</hi> when he Commissioned 'em to Authorize 'em so to do; and for the same reason we may be sure that so far forth as they <hi>did</hi> communicate it, it was our Saviours intention that they <hi>should,</hi> now, as was shewn before, to some they did communicate it for the Government of <hi>some</hi> Churches, as to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> for instance, for the Government of the Churches of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi>; from whence it is evident that it was our <hi>Saviours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> that they should communicate it to <hi>some</hi>; and for the same reason if it be made appear, that they did communicate it <hi>universally</hi> for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>all other</hi> Churches, it will necessarily follow, that it was our <hi>Saviours intention</hi> they should communicate it as an <hi>universal form</hi> of <hi>Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> Now whether they <hi>did</hi> communicate it <hi>universally</hi> or no, is a question about matter of Fact, and as such, is decidable only by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the most competent <hi>witnesses,</hi> and the most competent <hi>witness,</hi> in this case, is the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:58668:215"/>
Church</hi> in the Ages next succeeding the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> which Church attests with one <hi>universal consent</hi> the <hi>universal derivation</hi> of a <hi>Superiour Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of Ecclesiastick Officers from the Apostles to preside over the Churches of Christ. And some Christian Writers we have who were <hi>living</hi> in the very days of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and were their immediate <hi>Scholars</hi> and <hi>Disciples</hi>; others again, who lived in <hi>their</hi> days and were their <hi>Disciples,</hi> who lived in the <hi>Apostles</hi>; and others who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately succeeded <hi>these:</hi> from all which we have ample Testimonies of the <hi>continued Succession</hi> of this <hi>superiour Order,</hi> even from the <hi>Apostles</hi> to whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> first derived it. Out of all which I shall only produce some few instances out of an infinite number that might be given. Of the <hi>first</hi> sort are S. <hi>Clement</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch.</hi> S. <hi>Clement,</hi> who as <hi>Frenaeus</hi> tells us, <hi>saw</hi> the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>conversed familiarly</hi> with 'em, makes mention in his Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of <hi>three</hi> Orders of Ecclesiastical Officers in his time, whom he calls <hi>the High Priest, the Priests, and the Levites,</hi> which words can be no otherwise understood than of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, Presbyter</hi> and the <hi>Deacons:</hi> S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> who was the Disciple of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and in his life-time Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> is so <hi>full</hi> and <hi>express</hi> in all those six Epistles he wrote on the way to his Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for the <hi>derivation</hi> of this <hi>superiour Order</hi> from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that the adversaries of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der have no other way to evade him but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning those Epistles for <hi>Counterfeits</hi>; from which injurious sentence they have of late been so triumphantly vindicated by a <hi>Learned Pen</hi> of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:58668:215"/>
our own, that I dare say no man of Learning for the future will so far expose the Reputation of his <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Modesty</hi> as to call 'em in question again. Now in all these Epistles the holy Martyr not only distinguishes the Clergy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Bishops, Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> but strictly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns the two <hi>latter</hi> as well as the <hi>Laicks</hi> to be <hi>Dutiful</hi> and <hi>Obedient</hi> to the <hi>former</hi>; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in his Epistle to the <hi>Trallians, what is the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> saith he, <hi>but he that hath all Authority and Power, what is the Presbytery but a sacred Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Counsellors and Assessors to the Bishop, what are the Deacons but imitators of Christ, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to the Bishop as he was to the Father,</hi> and as he every where enjoyns <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Bishops</hi> as to the <hi>supreme</hi> Order in the Church of Christ, so in the beginning of his Epistle to the <hi>Philadelphians</hi> he tells them, that <hi>so many as belong to Christ are united to the Bishop, and that so many as depart from him and his Communion, and associate themselves with the accursed shall be cut off with them.</hi> And in his Epistle to the <hi>Magnesians</hi> he tells them, that <hi>it highly became them to obey their Bishop, and not to contradict him in any thing, for it is a terrible thing to contradict him, because in so doing you do not so much despise him who is visible as the invisible God who will not be despised, for his promotion is not from men but from God.</hi> And several of his Cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Bishops he mentions by name, <hi>viz. Onesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> Bishop of the <hi>Ephesians, Policarp</hi> of the <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Polybius</hi> of the <hi>Trallians,</hi> and <hi>Damas</hi> of the <hi>Magnesians,</hi> and still as he mentions them he high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commends the Presbyters and Deacons for their <hi>obedience</hi> to them. So in the beginning of
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:58668:216"/>
his Epistle to the <hi>Magnesians, Having been so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to see you by your worthy Bishop</hi> Damas, <hi>and your worthy Presbyters,</hi> viz. Bassus, <hi>and</hi> Apollinus, <hi>and</hi> Zotion <hi>your Deacon, whom I cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend for his obedience to the Bishop and the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry — you ought not to contemn the youth of your Bishop, but to pay him all veneration (as I know your holy Presbyters do) according to the appointment of God the Father.</hi> And in his Epistle to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians, Let us be careful,</hi> saith he, <hi>that we do not oppose the Bishop as we would be obedient to God; and if any man observe the silence of his Bishop, let him reverence him so much the more, for every one that the Master of the Family appoints to be his Steward, we ought to receive him as the Master himself, and therefore it is evident we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the Bishop as our Lord himself:</hi> from whence I infer first, that at the writing of these Epistles, which was not above eight or nine years after the decease of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> there were <hi>Bishops</hi> every where <hi>constituted</hi> over the Churches of Christ; for he not only mentions several Churches that had <hi>Bishops</hi> actually <hi>presiding</hi> over them, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares Bishops to be of <hi>Divine Ordination,</hi> and that they were to be obeyed, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, i. e. but <hi>because he obtained his dignity from those holy men, and the sacred hands of the blessed Apostles had been laid upon his head.</hi> And the same may be said of <hi>Polycarp</hi> Bishop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> of whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> makes honourable mention; and indeed it is not to be imagined that the Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches would ever have so <hi>universally</hi> admitted of <hi>Bishops</hi> as it is apparent they did in <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s time, when the <hi>Apostles</hi> were <hi>living,</hi> had not some of them at least derived their Authority from the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles immediately</hi>; and considering how much S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who survived the Apostles, was reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced to the last through all the Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, what likelihood is there that <hi>those</hi> very Churches should so far contemn both him and them, even whilst they were <hi>living</hi> among them, as to admit of a new order of men without their Authority, to <hi>Oversee</hi> and <hi>Govern</hi> them? but that <hi>de facto</hi> the Apostles did with their <hi>own</hi> hands Ordain <hi>several Bishops</hi> to preside over several Churches, is most certain, if any credit may be given to <hi>Ecclesiastical History,</hi> which assures us, that they ordained <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Areopagite Bishop of <hi>Athens, Caius</hi> of <hi>Thessalonica, Archyppus</hi> of <hi>Colosse, Onesimus</hi> of <hi>Ephesus, Antipas</hi> of <hi>Pergamus, Euphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus</hi> of <hi>Philippi, Crescens</hi> of the <hi>Gauls, Erastus</hi> of <hi>Macedonia, Trophimus</hi> of <hi>Arles, Iason</hi> of <hi>Tarsus, Titus</hi> of <hi>Corinth, Onisiphorus</hi> of <hi>Colophon, Quartus</hi> of <hi>Berytus, Paul</hi> the Proconsul of <hi>Narbona.</hi> Vid.

the <hi>Bishops</hi> of this Age were look'd upon as a <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> Order to all other Ecclesiastical Officers; for <hi>Ignatius</hi> not only enjoyns the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> their <hi>Bishops,</hi> but also presses them thereunto by the <hi>Command of Christ</hi> and if by <hi>Christs Command</hi> they were to obey their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> then by <hi>Christs Institution</hi> their <hi>Bishops</hi> were their <hi>Superiours.</hi> Thus much therefore we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of by the Testimony of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that in the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Age <hi>Bishops</hi> were <hi>universally</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Churches of Christ, that they <hi>derived</hi> their Authority from the hands of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and that by vertue of that <hi>Authority</hi> they were <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour</hi> to all other Ecclesiastical Officers; and this is all we contend for.</p>

About the same time lived <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lions,</hi> who, as himself tells us in his Epistle to <hi>Florinus,</hi> had often seen <hi>Polycarp</hi> the Disciple of S. <hi>Iohn, and did very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his person, and behaviour when he discoursed to

the Multitude the intimate conversation he had with S.</hi> John, <hi>and the rest of the Apostles who had seen our Lord.</hi> And from him we have this express Testimony concerning the matter in debate, <hi>We can reckon up those who were Ordained Bishops by the Apostles in the Churches, who they were that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded them even down to our times — for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles would have them to be in all things perfect and unreprovable whom they left to be their Successors, and to whom they delivered their Apostolick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And then he goes on, and gives us a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of Eleven Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> by name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from <hi>Linus,</hi> to whom he tells us S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul Episcopatum administrandae Ecclesiae tradiderunt,</hi> i. e. <hi>delivered the Episcopal power of Governing that Church,</hi> and ending with <hi>Elutheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> who was the twelfth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and did then actually preside in the Episcopal Chair, and that by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in this Age was meant such as presided over Presbyters as well as Laicks is evident by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> makes, who was <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Cotemporary, between the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, — <hi>i. e.</hi> that it was not honoured with the <hi>first Seat,</hi> or placed in the <hi>first Class</hi> of the Ecclesiastick Orders; which plainly shews that then there was an Order <hi>above</hi> the <hi>Presbytery, viz.</hi> the <hi>Bishops,</hi> whom presently after he mentions as the <hi>first</hi> Order of Ecclesiasticks.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, lately published,

is a plain Argument that in <hi>his</hi> time <hi>Bishops</hi> were look'd on as a <hi>distinct</hi> Order from the rest of the Clergy; for he tells us, that when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Patmos</hi> to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he visited the neighbouring Provinces, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>partly that he might ordain Bishops, and partly that he might set apart such for the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy as were pointed out to him by the Holy Spirit</hi>; by which it is evident that, in <hi>Clement</hi>'s time at least, and, if he be not mistaken, in S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s too, the <hi>Bishops</hi> were a <hi>distinct</hi> Order from the rest of the Clergy, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</hi> Thus both in the <hi>Apostolick Age,</hi> and that <hi>succeeding</hi> it, we have abundant <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>derivation</hi> of the superiority of the <hi>Apostolick Order</hi> from the Apostles to the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Churches of Christ.</p>
               <p>And then for the <hi>next</hi> Age we have the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Testimonies of <hi>Tertullian, Origen,</hi> and S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> not only of the <hi>continuance</hi> of this <hi>Apostolick</hi> superiority in the Church, but also of the <hi>deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it from the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves; but we need not cite their words, it being <hi>granted</hi> by the most learned Advocates of the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that for several years <hi>before</hi> these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>viz.</hi> about the year of our Lord 140. the <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was every where received in the Church; for they tell us, that though the <hi>Apostles</hi> exercised a superiority over the other Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Orders, yet they left <hi>none</hi> behind to succeed them in that power; but the Church <hi>was</hi> every where governed by a <hi>Common Council</hi> of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>; but <hi>this</hi> Form of Government being found
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:58668:219"/>
inconvenient, as giving too much occasion for <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions,</hi> it was at last universally agreed upon that <hi>one Presbyter</hi> should be chosen out to preside over all the rest; and this, say they, was the beginning of the Episcopacy; for which they cite that famous passage of S. <hi>Ierom, Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Diaboli instinctu,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. <hi>Before such time as through the instinct of the Devil divisions in Religion began, and it was said among the People, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>I am of</hi> Apollo, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were Governed by Common Councils of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but afterwards every Presbyter reckoning such as he baptized to be his and not Christs, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed over all the World, that one from among the Presbyters should be chosen and set over all the rest, to whom should belong all the care of the Churches, that so the seeds of Schisms might be destroyed</hi>; which universal Decree, as they guess, was made about the year 140. Now not to dispute with them the <hi>sense</hi> of this passage, but allowing it to bear their sense I shall only desire the Reader to consider,</p>
               <p>First, That it is the Testimony of one who lived long <hi>after</hi> the afore-cited Witnesses, and so far <hi>less capable</hi> of attesting so early a matter of fact; for some of the Witnesses above-cited were such as <hi>lived</hi> in the days of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> others, such as lived in their days who <hi>lived</hi> in the days of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and certainly these were much <hi>more competent</hi> Witnesses of what was done in the Apostles days than S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> who was not born till about the year 330. almost one hundred years after <hi>Origen</hi> the latest, and three hundred years after <hi>Clemens</hi> the earliest of the above-cited Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:58668:220"/>
and certainly to prefer the Authority of <hi>one single</hi> Witness, who lived so <hi>long after</hi> the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, to the <hi>unanimous</hi> attestations of so many <hi>earlier</hi> Witnesses, is both immodest and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is also to be considered, that S. <hi>Ierom</hi> was a witness in his <hi>own cause,</hi> in which case men of his <hi>warmth</hi> and <hi>passion</hi> are too too apt to exceed the limits of truth; for the design of that passage was to curb the insolence of some Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical <hi>Deacons,</hi> who would needs advance themselves above the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which Saint <hi>Ierom,</hi> being a Presbyter <hi>himself,</hi> takes in high disdain, and, as the best of men are too prone to do, when their <hi>own</hi> concerns are at <hi>stake,</hi> bends the stick too much t'other way, and depresses the <hi>Deacons</hi> too <hi>low,</hi> and advances the <hi>Presbyters</hi> too <hi>high.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="3">III. In other places, where he is not <hi>Biassed</hi> by partiality to his <hi>own Order,</hi> he talks at a quite different rate; so in Dial. advers. <hi>Luciferian: dost thou ask why one that is not Baptized by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop doth not receive the Holy Ghost? why it proceeds from hence that the Holy Ghost descended on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</hi> Where it is plain he places the <hi>Bishops</hi> in the same rank with the Apostles, so also in Ep. 1. <hi>ad Heliodor.</hi> speaking of the Bishops of his time, <hi>they stand,</hi> saith he, <hi>in the place of</hi> S. <hi>Paul, and hold the place of</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.16. <hi>Now because the Apostles are gone from the World thou hast instead of those their Sons the Bishops, and these are thy Fathers because thou art Governed by 'em:</hi> and Ep. <hi>ad Nepot. What</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons were, that we know the Bishops and the Presbyters
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:58668:220"/>
are.</hi> And therefore as <hi>Aaron</hi> by <hi>Divine Right</hi> was superiour to his Sons the <hi>Priests,</hi> so is the <hi>Bishop</hi> above his <hi>Presbyters</hi>; all which are as plain <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions</hi> to that famous passage of his (under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it as the <hi>Presbyterians do</hi>) as one propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition can be to another: and whether is a man more to be credited when he speaks without <hi>Bias</hi> or <hi>Partiality,</hi> or when he speaks in his <hi>own cause</hi> and under the influence of his <hi>own Interest?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. It is further to be considered, that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> of which S. <hi>Ierom</hi> here speaks, by which the Government of the Church was translated from a <hi>Common Council</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi> to a single <hi>Bishop,</hi> must according to his own words be <hi>Apostolick,</hi> and consequently much <hi>earlier</hi> than the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> will allow it; for it was made at that time when it was said among the People, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I am of</hi> Apollos, <hi>and I of Cephas</hi>; and this as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, was said in his time, and therefore this <hi>Decree</hi> must be made in <hi>his</hi> time, and that S. <hi>Ierome</hi> did mean so, we are elsewhere assured from his <hi>own</hi> words, for so in his Book <hi>de Eccles. Script.</hi> he tells us, <hi>that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the ascension of our Lord S.</hi> James <hi>was Ordained by the Apostles to be Bishop of</hi> Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Timothy <hi>by S.</hi> Paul <hi>Bishop of</hi> Ephesus, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus <hi>Bishop of</hi> Crete, <hi>and</hi> Polycarp <hi>by S.</hi> John <hi>Bishop of</hi> Smyrna. So that either he must here expresly <hi>contradict</hi> himself, or else the <hi>Decree</hi> of which he speaks must have been made <hi>immediately after the Ascension of our Lord,</hi> and consequently be a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree Apostolick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. It is yet farther to be considered that if any such <hi>Decree,</hi> of changing the Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:58668:221"/>

he being no farther <hi>distant</hi> from the one than we are from the other; and though through the <hi>Ambiguity</hi> or <hi>defect</hi> of the Records of <hi>some</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, this <hi>succession</hi> be not equally <hi>clear</hi> in all, yet in the most <hi>eminent Churches,</hi> such as <hi>Ierusalem, Rome, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the <hi>successions are as clear</hi> as any thing in Ecclesiastical History; and is it not much more reasonable to conclude what was the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>those</hi> Churches that are not <hi>known,</hi> from what we find was the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of those that are, than to question those Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Records that <hi>are</hi> preserved, because of the uncertainty of those that are <hi>not?</hi> for though we do not find in <hi>all</hi> Churches an <hi>exact</hi> Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of all their Bishops; yet we cannot produce any <hi>one</hi> instance in any <hi>one</hi> ancient Church of any <hi>other form</hi> of Government than the <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,</hi> and therefore we may as well question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever there was any such thing as an ancient <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the World, because many of the <hi>Histories</hi> of the Monarchs are <hi>defective</hi> as to their <hi>Names</hi> and the Order of their <hi>Succession,</hi> as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was ever any such thing as a <hi>Primitive Episcopacy</hi> in the Church, because the Records of several Churches are <hi>defective</hi> as to the <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Successions</hi> of their <hi>Bishops:</hi> Since therefore this Story of S. <hi>Ieroms</hi> universal <hi>Decree</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly altogether <hi>unattested,</hi> but also directly <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory</hi> to the concurrent Testimony of all <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> how can we reasonably look upon it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than as a mere <hi>figment</hi> of his own fancy? especially considering</p>

his <hi>Apostles:</hi> for the <hi>Apostles,</hi> devolving the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church upon Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Presbyters</hi> was, as he himself tells us, the occasion of sundry <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi>; for the removal of which, the Church afterwards found it necessary to <hi>dissolve</hi> those <hi>Presbyteries</hi> and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in their Room; and this S. <hi>Ierom</hi> approves as a very wise and prudent action, for saith he, <hi>the safety of the Church depends upon the Authority of the High-Priest</hi> or Bishop, <hi>to whom if there were not given by all supreme Authority, there would be as many Schisms in the Churches as there are Priests.</hi> So that according to him, had the Church continued under that Government which the <hi>Apostles</hi> left in it, it must unavoidably have been <hi>torn in pieces</hi> with endless <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>; and if so, either the <hi>Apostles</hi> were very <hi>imprudent</hi> in not foreseeing this, or very <hi>neglective</hi> in not preventing it; so that had not the <hi>after-age</hi> taken care to supply the <hi>defect</hi> of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, by erecting a <hi>wiser-form</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> than they left, the Church had infallibly run to <hi>ruin.</hi> This is the unavoidable consequence of S. <hi>Ieroms</hi> Hypothesis; which therefore I can look upon no otherwise than as a mere <hi>device</hi> of his own brain snatched up in hast to defend his Order against the Insolence of those Factious <hi>Deacons,</hi> that flew in the face of the <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This therefore being removed, which is the <hi>main,</hi> and indeed the <hi>only</hi> considerable <hi>Objection</hi> against the <hi>universal conformity</hi> of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church to the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government, it remains, that if any credit may be given either to those Writers that lived in the <hi>Apostolick age,</hi> or to those
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:58668:222"/>
who immediately <hi>succeeded</hi> 'em, it is evident from their unanimous Testimonies, that the <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is nothing else but only the <hi>Apostolick superiority</hi> derived from the hands of the <hi>Apostles</hi> in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>succession</hi> from one Generation to another; and to <hi>reject</hi> their Testimony is not only very <hi>unreasonable</hi> (there being at least as much reason why we should reject all ancient History) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of very <hi>dangerous</hi> consequence, since 'tis from thence that we derive the very <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and so we may as well reject it in <hi>this</hi> instance as in the <hi>other.</hi>

               <p n="4">IV.

In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore to the clearing this matter I shall shew,</p>
               <p>First, That they were <hi>single</hi> persons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That they were persons of great <hi>Authority</hi> in those Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:58668:223"/>Thirdly, That they were the <hi>Presidents</hi> or <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ps</hi> of those Churches.</p>
               <p>First, That they were <hi>single</hi> Persons, is evident because they are all along mentioned as such; <hi>the Angel of the Church of</hi> Ephesus in the singular number, <hi>the Angel of the Church of</hi> Smyrna, and so of all the rest; and so every where in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Epistles they are all along addrest to in the <hi>singular</hi> number; <hi>I know thy works and thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, nevertheless I have a few things against thee, remember whence thou art fallen, repent, and do thy first works,</hi> and the like; in all which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our plainly writes to 'em as to <hi>single</hi> persons: It is true what he writes to them, he writes not only to them <hi>personally,</hi> but also to the <hi>People</hi> under their <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>inspection</hi>; and therefore sometimes he mentions the People Plurally; so <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>The Devil shall cast some of you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Prison,</hi> and so <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and <hi>ver.</hi> 23. but this is so far from arguing that these <hi>Angels</hi> were not <hi>single</hi> persons, that it argues the quite <hi>contrary</hi>; since if they had not, what reason can there be assigned why our Saviour should not mention them <hi>plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> as well as the <hi>People?</hi> I know it is objected that the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Plurally. Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>but unto you I say, and unto the rest of Thyatira,</hi> where by <hi>you,</hi> it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed must be meant the <hi>Angel,</hi> and by <hi>the rest of Thyatira,</hi> the <hi>People.</hi> To which I answer, that in the ancient Greek Manuscripts, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in that at S. <hi>Iames</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>and</hi> is left out, and so the words run thus, <hi>but unto you the rest of Thyatira,</hi> or <hi>to the rest of you at Thyatira,</hi> which is set in opposition to those of <hi>Thyatira</hi> that had been
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:58668:223"/>
                  <hi>seduced</hi> into the Sect of <hi>Iezebel,</hi> and therefore cannot be understood of the <hi>Angel</hi> who is all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long mentioned in the <hi>singular</hi> number, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had he not been a <hi>single</hi> person, no account can be given why he should be mentioned singly, and <hi>the rest of Thyatira</hi> Plurally. But then</p>
               <p>Secondly, That these single persons were of great <hi>Authority</hi> in those Churches is evident not only by that honourable title of <hi>Angel,</hi> that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, which plainly shews them to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Eminence,</hi> and that not only by our <hi>Saviours</hi> directing his Epistles to <hi>them,</hi> to be <hi>communicated</hi> by them to their several Churches, but also from that <hi>authority</hi> which the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> exercised there, and which the Angels of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira</hi> ought to have exercised, but did <hi>not:</hi> For as for the Angel of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he is commended for <hi>trying them which said they were Apostles, and were not,</hi> and discovering them to be <hi>liars,</hi> which words plainly denote a <hi>Iuridical Trial</hi> and <hi>Conviction</hi> of some person or persons, who <hi>pretended</hi> to <hi>Apostolical Authority,</hi> but upon examination were found to be <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors:</hi> and then as for the Angel of the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> he is blamed for <hi>having</hi> in his Church <hi>those that held the Doctrine of</hi> Balaam, or of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi>; which plainly shews that he had <hi>power</hi> to remedy it by casting them out of the Church; for if he had not, how could he have been justly <hi>blamed</hi> for suffering them? And the same may be said of the Angel of the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> who is also blamed for <hi>suffering the woman</hi> Jezebel, which was not in his power to prevent, unless we suppose him to have <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:58668:224"/>
to eject her and her Followers. But then</p>
               <p>Thirdly and lastly, That these <hi>single</hi> persons were the <hi>Presidents</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi> of those Churches, is also evident from the most <hi>Primitive Antiquity</hi>; for so in the Anonymus Tract of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom recorded in <hi>Biblioth. Pat. n.</hi> 244. we are told, that when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle returned from his Exile in <hi>Patmos,</hi> which was two or three years after he wrote his Revelations, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>that being assisted with the presence of the seven Bishops of that Province he assumed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the government of it.</hi> Now that these seven <hi>Bishops</hi> were the same with those seven <hi>Angels</hi> he wrote to in his Revelations is evident, because all those seven Churches in which those seven Angels presided, lay within the Circuit of the <hi>Lydian</hi> or <hi>Proconsular Asia,</hi> of which <hi>Ephesus</hi> was the Metropolis; and therefore who else can we so fairly suppose these seven <hi>Bishops</hi> to be, by whom he governed the Province of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as the seven <hi>Angels</hi> of those seven Churches which were all of them within that Province? and S. <hi>Austin</hi> expresly calls the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the <hi>Proepositus Ecclesiae, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Governour</hi> of the Church, <hi>Ep.</hi> 162. and speaking of those seven <hi>Angels,</hi> he stiles them <hi>Episcopi sive praepositi Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siarum, the Bishops or Governours of the Churches, Comment. in Revel.</hi> so also the Commentaries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> referring to these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in 1 <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 11. expresly tells us, that by those <hi>Angels he means the Bishops,</hi> and that they were so, is most indubitably evident of the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> in particular, who could be
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:58668:224"/>
no other than S. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> who was most certainly made Bishop of <hi>Smyrna</hi> some years <hi>before</hi> the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these Epistles, and continued Bishop of it a great many years <hi>after</hi>; for so <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who was his Cotemporary, in his Epistle to that Church stiles him <hi>Polycarp your Bishop,</hi> and earnestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts his <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> as well as the <hi>Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to be subject to him; and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> who <hi>perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally knew</hi> him hath this passage concerning him: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Polycarpus was not only instructed by the Apostles, and did not only converse with many of those who had seen our Lord, but by the Apostles who were in</hi> Asia, <hi>was made Bishop of</hi> Smyrna, <hi>Euseb. Hist. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 15. and in their Encyclical Epistle of his Martyrdom the whole Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> stile him <hi>Bishop of the Catholick Church of</hi> Smyrna, <hi>ibid.</hi> So also <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycrates,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> who was thirty eight years old when <hi>Polycarp</hi> suffered, tells us, that <hi>he was Bishop and Martyr in</hi> Smyrna, <hi>Euseb. Hist. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 24. And the same is attested by <hi>Tertullian, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi> and S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> and indeed by <hi>all</hi> Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick <hi>antiquity:</hi> so that it is a plain case, that <hi>one</hi> of these <hi>Angels,</hi> to whom S. <hi>Iohn</hi> writes, was <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of the Church whereof he stiles him the <hi>Angel,</hi> and since <hi>one</hi> was so, to be sure <hi>all</hi> were so; especially considering that <hi>very near,</hi> if not at the <hi>very time</hi> when these Epistles were written, we have certain accounts that there were <hi>Bishops</hi> actually <hi>presiding</hi> in these seven Churches. So within twelve years <hi>after</hi> these Epistles were written, <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> makes mention of <hi>Onesimus</hi> their <hi>Bishop,</hi> whom he exhorts them all, as well <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi>
                  <pb n="426" facs="tcp:58668:225"/>
as <hi>Laity,</hi> to <hi>obey.</hi> That there was also at the same time a Bishop in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is abundantly evident from <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistle to that Church though he doth not name him; and about the same time <hi>Carpus</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Thyatira</hi> as the ancient Roman Martyrology testifies, and <hi>Sega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Vid. <hi>Euseb. Hist. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 25. And <hi>Melito</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sardis,</hi> ibid. And as for the Church of <hi>Pergamus Paraeus</hi> in his Commentary on <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. of the <hi>Revelations</hi> proves out of <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Caesariensis</hi> that <hi>Antipas that faithful Martyr</hi> mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13. was Bishop of it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>before</hi> the Angel of that Church to whom S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote, and that <hi>that</hi> Angel was one <hi>Gaius,</hi> who as he proves out of <hi>Clemens</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately succeeded <hi>Antipas</hi> in the Episcopal Chair. Since therefore it is apparent that <hi>at</hi> the writing these Epistles to these seven Churches there was a <hi>Bishop</hi> actually <hi>presiding</hi> in <hi>one</hi> of them, and that about the <hi>same</hi> time there were <hi>Bishops</hi> presiding also in <hi>all</hi> the rest, there can be no <hi>colour</hi> of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to doubt, but that <hi>all</hi> those Churches had <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> in them when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote to them; and if so, to be sure those <hi>Bishops</hi> being the <hi>Governours</hi> of those Churches, and having the charge of them committed to them, were those very <hi>Angels</hi> whom S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote to, because he all along writes to them as to those who were the <hi>Overseers</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of their respective Churches; and if those <hi>Angels</hi> were <hi>Bishops,</hi> then in them our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> expresly <hi>allows</hi> and <hi>approves</hi> of the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Order, since he not only dignifies them with the name of <hi>Angels,</hi> but calls them <hi>stars in his own right hand.</hi>

               <p n="1">I.

But yet as for the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Preaching,</hi> it is plain that none were ever admitted to it, but either by <hi>immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> from our Saviour, or by <hi>Apostolick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> or by an immediate <hi>Miraculous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the Holy Ghost, by which they were <hi>inspired</hi> with the gift of Preaching, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>readily,</hi> and without any study of their <hi>own</hi> to explain, and prove, and apply the Doctrines of the Gospel to their Hearers; and that, either in their <hi>own</hi> or <hi>other</hi> Languages, as occasion required; which gift was the same with that which is called in Scripture, <hi>the gift of utterance</hi>; and it being bestowed upon them for the publick benefit and edification of the Church, the very <hi>bestowing</hi> it, (without any other <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>) was an <hi>immediate Mission</hi> from the Holy Ghost; only they who pretended to it, were to be <hi>tried</hi> by such as had the gift of <hi>discerning of Spirits,</hi> vid. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29. and if upon that trial their pretence was found <hi>real,</hi> they were owned and received with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more ado as <hi>authorized Preachers</hi> sent by the Holy Ghost; and it was upon this <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Mission,</hi> as it seems very probable, that those <hi>extraordinary Offices</hi> of Prophets and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists were founded, both which included Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

to <hi>preach</hi> the Gospel; and therefore upon the <hi>Cessation</hi> of this <hi>extraordinary Mission</hi> those <hi>Offices ceased</hi> immediately with it, as depending wholly upon it, and from thenceforth <hi>none</hi> were ever admitted to the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Preaching,</hi> but by <hi>ordinary Mission</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> from the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late derived to the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of the Church. For though there are some very early instances of learned <hi>Lay-men</hi> that were admitted to <hi>preach</hi> upon some <hi>emergent</hi> occasions, and upon special <hi>license</hi> from the <hi>Bishop,</hi> yet can there no <hi>one</hi> instance be produced of any that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Preaching,</hi> without Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Ordination.</p>

of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15, 16, 17. where he tells us, that he baptized <hi>none</hi> in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> though it were of his <hi>own</hi> planting, except <hi>Crispus, Gaius,</hi> and the Houshold of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus,</hi> is a plain Argument that when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had <hi>converted</hi> men to the Christian Faith, they generally ordered them to be baptized by the <hi>inferiour Ministers</hi> of the Church that attended them; and then as for the <hi>Consecration</hi> of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eucharist, though when any of the <hi>Apostles</hi> were present, it was doubtless <hi>ordinarily</hi> perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, yet considering how fast Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity encreased, and how <hi>frequently</hi> Christians did then partake of this Sacrament, it is not to be supposed that the <hi>Apostles</hi> could be present in <hi>all</hi> places where it was administred, nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that they could consecrate it in <hi>every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Congregation: For though it was a very <hi>early</hi> Custom for the <hi>Bishop</hi> to <hi>consecrate</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>one</hi> Congregation, and then send them <hi>abroad</hi> to be administred in several <hi>others</hi>; yet this was only upon <hi>special</hi> occasions: but <hi>ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> they were <hi>consecrated</hi> in the same places where they were <hi>administred</hi>; in all which places it was impossible either for the <hi>Apostles</hi> at first, or after them for their <hi>Successors,</hi> the <hi>Bishops,</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the same time; and therefore there can be no doubt but the <hi>Consecration</hi> as well as the <hi>Administration</hi> was ordinarily performed by the <hi>inferiour Presbyters,</hi> in the absence of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> and <hi>Bishops.</hi> But it is most certain, that <hi>none</hi> were ever allowed in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church to <hi>consecrate</hi> the Eucharist, but either a <hi>Bishop</hi> or a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> And as for <hi>Baptism,</hi> because it is in
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:58668:227"/>
some degree more <hi>necessary</hi> than the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as being the sign of <hi>admission</hi> into the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> by which we are first intitled to it, not only <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but in their absence, or by their allowance, <hi>Deacons</hi> also were Authorized to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister it; for so even in the Apostles days <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the Deacon baptized at <hi>Samaria, Acts</hi> 8.12. and afterwards not only <hi>Deacons</hi> but <hi>Lay-men</hi> too were allowed to administer it in case of <hi>necessity,</hi> when neither a <hi>Deacon,</hi> nor <hi>Presbyter,</hi> nor <hi>Bishop</hi> could be procured; that so none might be <hi>debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> of admission into the <hi>New Covenant</hi> that were disposed and qualified to receive it; but the Churches allowing this to <hi>Lay-men</hi> only in cases of <hi>necessity,</hi> is a plain Argument that none had a <hi>standing Authority</hi> to administer it, but only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in <hi>holy Orders.</hi> For that authority which a <hi>present necessity</hi> creates, is only <hi>present,</hi> and <hi>ceases</hi> with the necessity that created it.</p>

Now <hi>Prayer</hi> is one of the most <hi>solemn</hi> Offices of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Assemblies, and therefore as in the Jewish Church none but the <hi>High Priest</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> who were the <hi>only publick Ministers</hi> of Religion, were authorized to offer up the <hi>publick Prayers</hi> of the Congregation, <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 39.27. so in the Christian none but <hi>Bishops, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> who <hi>alone</hi> are the <hi>publick Ministers</hi>

thus given an account of those Religious <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries</hi> which are <hi>common</hi> to the <hi>Bishops</hi> with the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Officers</hi> of the Church, I proceed in the next place to shew what those <hi>Ministries</hi> are which are <hi>peculiar</hi> to the Bishops or Governours of the Church, all which are reducible to four particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: 1. To <hi>make Laws</hi> for the peace and good order of the Church. 2. To <hi>Ordain</hi> to Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Offices. 3. To <hi>execute</hi> that spiritual Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which Christ hath established in his Church. 4. To <hi>confirm</hi> such as have been instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Christianity.</p>
               <p n="1">I. One <hi>peculiar</hi> Ministry of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> of the Church is to make <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> for the security and preservation of the Churches peace and good order; and this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the very <hi>Essence</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> which necessarily supposes a <hi>Legislative power</hi> within it self, to command and oblige the Subject to <hi>do</hi> or <hi>forbear</hi> such things as it shall judge conducive to the <hi>preservation</hi> or <hi>disturbance</hi> of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal, without which power no Government can be enabled to obtain its end, which is the <hi>good of the Publick.</hi> Since therefore the Church, by Christs <hi>own</hi> institution, is a <hi>governed Society</hi> of men, we must either suppose its Government to be very <hi>lame</hi> and <hi>defective,</hi> which would be to blaspheme the Wisdom of our Saviour, or allow it to have a <hi>Legislative Power</hi> inherent in it. But that <hi>de facto</hi> it hath such a <hi>Power</hi> in it is evident from the Practice of the <hi>Apostles</hi>; who, as all agree, had the Reins of Church Government delivered into their hands by our Saviour; for so in <hi>Acts</hi> 15.6. we are told, that upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:58668:229"/>
of that famous Controversie about Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, <hi>the Apostles and Elders came together to consider of this matter</hi>; where by the <hi>Elders,</hi> by the consent of all Antiquity is meant the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Iudea, Vid.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 11. <hi>Note B.</hi> And after mature debate and deliberation this is the result of the Council, <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burthen than these necessary things,</hi> ver. 28. so that those <hi>necessary things</hi> specified in the next <hi>verse</hi> were, it seems, <hi>laid upon</hi> them as <hi>a burthen, i. e.</hi> legally imposed on them as matter of <hi>duty</hi>; for herein it is plain the Apostles exercised a <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power</hi> over those Christian Communities, they wrote to, <hi>viz.</hi> in requiring 'em to abstain from some things which were <hi>never</hi> prohibited <hi>before</hi> by any standing Law of Christanity: and as the <hi>Apostles</hi> and Primitive <hi>Bishops</hi> made Laws by common consent for the Church in general, so did they also by their own <hi>single</hi> authority for <hi>particular</hi> Churches, to which they were more <hi>peculiarly</hi> related. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> after he had prescribed some Rules to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their more decent communication of the Lords Supper, tells them, that <hi>other things he would set in order when he came among them,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.34. but how could he otherwise do this than by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them certain Laws and Canons for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter regulation of their Religious Offices: so also 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. the same Apostle makes mention of an <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Canon,</hi> which he gave to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> which he enjoyns the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> also to observe, and in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. he gives <hi>Timothy</hi> several Ecclesiastical Rules to <hi>give in
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:58668:229"/>
charge</hi> to his Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. so also <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. he tells <hi>Titus,</hi> that for this cause he left him in <hi>Crete</hi> with Apostolick or Episcopal power <hi>that he might set in order the things that were wanting,</hi> i. e. that by wholsom Laws and Constitutions he might <hi>redress</hi> those <hi>disorders,</hi> and <hi>supply</hi> those <hi>defects</hi> which the shortness of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> stay there would not permit him to provide for. By all which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances it is abundantly evident that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church have a <hi>Legislative Power</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in them both to make Laws by common consent for the Regulation of the Church in <hi>general,</hi> and to prescribe the rules of <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> in their own <hi>particular</hi> Churches. For what the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Primitive Bishops</hi> did, to be sure they had <hi>Authority</hi> to do, and whatsoever <hi>Authority they</hi> had, they <hi>derived</hi> it down to their <hi>Successors.</hi> And accordingly we find this <hi>Ecclesiastick Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was always administred by the Apostles <hi>Successors</hi> the <hi>Bishops,</hi> who not only gave Laws both to the Clergy and Laity in their own <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches,</hi> but also made Laws for the <hi>whole Church</hi> by common consent in their holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, wherein during the first four general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils no Ecclesiastick beneath a <hi>Bishop</hi> was ever al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a Suffrage, unless it were by <hi>deputation</hi> from his Bishop; and though in making Laws for their <hi>own</hi> Churches they generally conducted themselves by the advice and counsel of their <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and sometimes also admitted them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their debates both in their Provincial and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, yet this was only in <hi>preparing</hi> the matter of their Laws. But that which gave them the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Laws</hi> was purely the <hi>Episcopal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:58668:230"/>
and <hi>Suffrage</hi>; and whatsoever was decreed either by the Bishop in Council with his <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> or by the <hi>Bishops</hi> in Council among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, was always received by the Churches of Christ as <hi>Authentick Law.</hi> It is true, this <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power</hi> of the Church (as was shewn before,) extends not so far as to controul the Decrees of the <hi>Civil Sovereign,</hi> who is next to, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately under God in all Causes, and over all Persons Supreme, and is no otherwise accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Laws of <hi>Christianity,</hi> than he was by the Laws of <hi>natural Religion</hi>; and therefore as the <hi>Civil Sovereign</hi> cannot countermand <hi>Gods</hi> Laws, so neither can the <hi>Church</hi> the <hi>Civil Sovereigns:</hi> but yet as next to the Laws of <hi>God</hi> the Laws of the <hi>Civil Sovereign</hi> are to be obeyed, so next to the Laws of the <hi>Civil Sovereign</hi> the Laws of the <hi>Church</hi> are to be obeyed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Another <hi>peculiar</hi> Ministry of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of the Church is to <hi>Consecrate</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain</hi> to Ecclesiastical Offices. For that those <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ministries</hi> which Christ himself performed while he was on Earth, such as <hi>preaching</hi> the Gospel, <hi>administring</hi> the Evangelical Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might be continued in his Church throughout all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, he not only <hi>himself</hi> ordained his twelve <hi>Apostles</hi> a little before he left the World, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>those Ministries</hi> in his absence, but in their <hi>Ordination</hi> transferred on them his <hi>own mission</hi> from the Father, deriving upon them the <hi>same authority</hi> to <hi>ordain others</hi> that he had to ordain <hi>them</hi>; that so they might derive <hi>their Mission</hi> to <hi>others</hi> as he did <hi>his</hi> to <hi>them</hi> through all succeeding Generations; for this is necessarily implied in
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:58668:230"/>
the Commission he gave them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.21. <hi>As my Father hath sent me, so send I you,</hi> that is, I do not only send you with full authority to act for <hi>me</hi> in all things as my Father sent me to act for <hi>him</hi>; but I also send you with the same authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to send <hi>others,</hi> that I now exercise in sending <hi>you</hi>; for unless this be implied in their Mission, he did not send them as his Father sent <hi>him,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he gave them the <hi>same authority</hi> to propagate <hi>their Mission</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> that his Father gave him to propagate <hi>his Mission</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> how could he say that <hi>he sent them as his Father sent him?</hi> since he must have sent them <hi>without</hi> that very authority from his Father, which he then <hi>exercised</hi> in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Now the <hi>Persons</hi> whom he sent were the Eleven Apostles as you will see by comparing this of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> with <hi>Luke</hi> 24.33.36. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.16. in all which places we are expresly told, that it was the Eleven he appeared to when he gave this <hi>Commission,</hi> and consequently, it must be the Eleven to whom he gave it. This <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> therefore of sending <hi>others</hi> being originally transferred by our Saviour upon the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Order, no others could have right to <hi>transfer</hi> it to others, but only such as were admitted of <hi>that Order</hi>; none could give it to <hi>others,</hi> but only those to whom <hi>Christ</hi> gave it; and therefore since Christ himself gave it to none but <hi>Apostles,</hi> none but <hi>Apostles</hi> could derive it: and accordingly we find in Scripture that all <hi>Ecclesiastick Commissions</hi> were either given by the hands of some of those <hi>first Apostles</hi> who received their Commission <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> from our Saviour, or else by some of those <hi>secondary Apostles,</hi> that were admitted into
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:58668:231"/>
                  <hi>Apostolick</hi> Orders by them; which <hi>secondary Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> as was shewn before, were the same with those whom we now call <hi>Bishops</hi>; for so in <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3.6. the seven first <hi>Deacons</hi> we read of were Ordained by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the whole number of the Disciples being present, but the Apostles on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>appointing and laying their hands on them,</hi> and in <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. we are told, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> two of the <hi>Apostles, ordained Elders in every Church,</hi> that is, of <hi>Lystra, Iconium,</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi>; and though these two were Ordained Apostles of the Gentiles by <hi>certain Prophets and Teachers</hi> in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts 13.1.3. yet there is no doubt but those <hi>Prophets and Teachers</hi> where such as had received the <hi>Apostolick Character,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordained by the Apostles Bishops of the Churches of <hi>Syria,</hi>) for otherwise how could they have <hi>derived it?</hi> For so <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> are called Prophets, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.32. and yet <hi>ver.</hi> 22. they are said to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Rulers among the Brethren,</hi> or Bishops of <hi>Iudea,</hi> and afterwards we find that Ordination was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined</hi> to such as had been admitted to the <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>; for so the power of <hi>laying on of hands</hi> in the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was committed by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom he himself by <hi>the laying on of hands</hi> had ordained the <hi>Apostle</hi> or <hi>Bishop</hi> of that Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. so also the power of Ordaining in the Church of <hi>Crete</hi> was by S. <hi>Paul</hi> committed to <hi>Titus,</hi> whom he had also Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Apostle</hi> or <hi>Bishop</hi> of that Church, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>for this cause left I thee in</hi> Crete <hi>to ordain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in every City.</hi> Thus all through the whole Scripture History we find the power of <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

administred by such, and none but such as were of the <hi>Apostolick Order, viz.</hi> either by the <hi>Prime Apostles,</hi> or by the <hi>secondary Apostles</hi> or <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi> And if we consult the <hi>Primitive Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> which to be sure, in matters of <hi>fact</hi> at least, are the best Interpreters of Scripture, we shall always find the power of giving Orders <hi>confined</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> to <hi>Bishops,</hi> which is so undeniable that S. <hi>Ierom</hi> himself, who endeavours his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to <hi>equalize</hi> Presbyters with Bishops, is yet fain to do it with an <hi>excepta Ordinatione, Ep. ad Evagr.

               <p n="3">III. Another <hi>peculiar</hi> Ministry of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of the Church is to execute that <hi>spiritual Iurisdiction</hi> which Christ hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in it, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>Cite</hi> such as are accused of scandalous offences before their Tribunals, to <hi>inspect</hi> and <hi>examine</hi> the Accusation, and upon sufficient evidence of the truth of it, to <hi>admonish</hi> the offender of his fault, and in case he obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately persist in it, to <hi>exclude</hi> him from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of the Church, and from all the Benefits of Christianity, till such time as he gives sufficient evidence of his Repentance and amendment, and then to <hi>receive</hi> him in again. For that Christ hath established such a <hi>jurisdiction</hi> in his Church is evident from that passage, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.16, 17, 18. <hi>Moreover, if thy Brother shall trespass against thee, go tell him his fault between him and thee alone, if he shall hear thee, thou hast gain'd thy Brother, but if he will not hear thee, then take with

16.19. <hi>I will give unto thee the Keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in Heaven</hi>; where by <hi>the Keys of the kingdom of Heaven,</hi> is plainly meant the Authority of a <hi>Steward</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Church or Family, for so <hi>Isa.</hi> 22.21, 22.

This <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Iurisdiction</hi> therefore of governing the Church, and administring the Censures of it, being by our Saviour wholly lodged in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolate,</hi> none can justly claim or pretend to it but such as are of the <hi>Apostolick Order,</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Age we find it was always administred either <hi>immediately</hi> by the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, or by the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the several Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

to whom they <hi>communicated</hi> their Order; for thus in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> it was S. <hi>Paul</hi> who pronounced the Sentence of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation against the incestuous person; <hi>for I verily as absent in body, but present in spirit have judged</hi> or pronounced Sentence <hi>already as though I were present concerning him that hath done this deed,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.3. and what he orders them to do, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. was only to declare and execute his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. he threatens them <hi>that heretofore had sinned that if he came again he would not spare them,</hi> and that by his <hi>not sparing them</hi> he meant that he would proceed against them with <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures</hi> is evident from <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>In the mouth of two or three Witnesses shall every word be established,</hi> which are the very words of our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.16. when he instituted the power of Censuring; and then <hi>ver.</hi> 10. he tells them, that <hi>he wrote these things being absent, lest being present he should use severity according to the power which the Lord had given them to edification, and not to destruction,</hi> by which it is plain he means the power of Excommunicating: and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. he threatens to <hi>come to them with a Rod,</hi> that is to chastise them with the <hi>Censures</hi> of the Church, and with this Rod, as he himself tells, he chastised <hi>Hymenoeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> two stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Hereticks in the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> whom <hi>he delivered unto Satan that they might learn not to blaspheme,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.20. and as he frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted the <hi>Censures</hi> of the Church in his <hi>own</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, so he <hi>derived</hi> this spiritual <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> whom he Ordained <hi>Apostles</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:58668:234"/>
for so he orders <hi>Timothy, against an Elder, Receive not an Accusation but before two or three Witnesses,</hi> which plainly implies his <hi>Authority</hi> to examine and try the <hi>causes</hi> even of the <hi>Elders</hi> themselves, when they were accused, and to <hi>punish</hi> them if he found them guilty, for so it follows, <hi>Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.19, 20. so also he exhorts <hi>Titus</hi> to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise this his spiritual Jurisdiction; <hi>A man that is an Heretick, after the first and second admonition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> Tit. 3.10. which plainly implies, that he had an Authority <hi>inherent</hi> in him, as he was the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> or <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> to <hi>Cite, Examine, Admonish,</hi> and <hi>Censure</hi> persons of erronious Principles; and the <hi>same</hi> Authority, it is evident, was inherent in the <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi> of the seven Churches of <hi>Asia.</hi> Thus the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> had Authority to <hi>try</hi> such as <hi>said they were Apostles and were not,</hi> and to convict them for <hi>Liars,</hi> Rev. 2.2. and the Bishop of <hi>Pergamus</hi> is blamed for <hi>tolerating</hi> the Sect of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> in his Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. and so also is the Bishop of <hi>Thyatira</hi> for <hi>suffering that woman Iezebel,</hi> ver. 20. which plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that the Authority of <hi>curbing</hi> and <hi>correcting</hi> those profligate Sectaries, was <hi>inherent</hi> in them; else why should they be <hi>blamed</hi> any more than others for <hi>not restraining</hi> them? From all which it is evident that the power of Christian Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was <hi>Originally</hi> seated in the <hi>Apostolate,</hi> and that throughout the <hi>Apostolick Age</hi> it was always exercised by such, and only such as were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into that <hi>sovereign Order, viz.</hi> either by the twelve <hi>Prime Apostles,</hi> or by those <hi>secondary Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> whom they ordained <hi>Bishops</hi> of particular
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:58668:234"/>
Churches; and accordingly we find in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Ages the <hi>Bishops</hi> were the <hi>sole</hi> administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this spiritual <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> and though <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily</hi> they administred it with the advice and concurrence of their <hi>Presbytery,</hi> yet this was more than they thought themselves <hi>obliged</hi> to; for thus S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the time of his recess did by his own <hi>single Authority</hi> Excommunicate <hi>Felicissimus, Augen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and others of his Presbyters, <hi>Ep.</hi> 38, 39. and when <hi>Rogatianus</hi> a Bishop of his Metropolitick Church complained to him in a Synod of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly <hi>Deacon,</hi> he tells him, that <hi>pro Episcopatus vigore &amp; Cathedrae authoritate, i. e.</hi> by his own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal authority, without appealing to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, he might have chastised him. And the fifth Canon of the first <hi>Nicene</hi> Council plainly shews, that it was then the judgment of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church that the power of <hi>spiritual Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> was <hi>wholly</hi> seated in the <hi>Bishops:</hi> for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees that in every Province there should be twice a year a <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any person, Lay or Clergy, had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly <hi>excommunicated</hi> by his Bishop; which shews that then this Sentence was inflicted by the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop only</hi>; though afterwards to prevent abuses it was decreed in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that <hi>the Bishop should hear no mans Cause but in the presence of his Clergy, and that his Sentence should be void unless it were confirmed by their presence</hi>; but yet still the Sentence was peculiarly <hi>his</hi> and not his <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies.</hi> In some Churches indeed the <hi>Bishops</hi> did many times <hi>delegat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:58668:235"/>
in this case the Presbyter was only the <hi>Bishops mouth,</hi> and his Sentence received all its force from that <hi>Episcopal Authority</hi> he was armed with.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Another <hi>peculiar</hi> Ministry of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of the Church, is to <hi>Confirm</hi> such as have been Baptized and instructed in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity; which Ministry was always performed by <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> upon which the Party so Confirmed received the gift of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.</hi> It is true, upon the <hi>first institution</hi> of this Imposition of hands the <hi>extraordinary</hi> gifts of the Spirit, such as speaking with Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were many times consequent, but from hence it doth no more follow that it was intended only for an <hi>extraordinary Ministry</hi> that was to <hi>cease</hi> with those <hi>extraordinary Gifts</hi> that accompanied it, than that <hi>Preaching</hi> was so which at first was also attended with miraculous <hi>operations.</hi> The great intendment of those extraordinary effects was to attest the <hi>efficacy</hi> of the Function; and doth it therefore follow that the <hi>Function</hi> must <hi>cease,</hi> because those <hi>extraordinary</hi> effects did so, after they had <hi>sufficiently</hi> attested its efficacy, and consequently were of no farther <hi>use</hi>? If so, then all the <hi>other</hi> Ministries of Christianity must be expired as well as this. And what though those <hi>extraordinary</hi> Gifts of the Spirit are <hi>ceased?</hi> Yet since our Saviour hath promised a <hi>continual</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his Spirit to his Church, is it not highly reasonable to believe, that he <hi>still continues</hi> to communicate it by the very same Ministry of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Imposition of hands,</hi> whereby he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it <hi>first</hi>; and that he <hi>now</hi> derives to us
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:58668:235"/>
the <hi>ordinary</hi> operations of it in the same way that he <hi>first</hi> derived the <hi>extraordinary</hi> ones? Especially considering that this <hi>laying on of hands</hi> is placed by the Apostle in the same Class with <hi>Baptism,</hi> and made one of the <hi>Principles of the Doctrine of Christ,</hi> Heb. 6.1, 2. and therefore must without all doubt be intended for a <hi>standing Ministry</hi> in the Church, and as such the Church of Christ in all Ages has thought her self obliged to <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> it; but as for the administration of it, it was always <hi>appropriated</hi> to the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Bishops.</hi> So in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.5, 6. it was S. <hi>Paul</hi> that laid his hands on the <hi>Ephesians</hi> after they were Baptized in the name of Jesus, whereupon it is said that the <hi>Holy Ghost came upon them</hi>; and in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. we read, that when S. <hi>Philip</hi> by his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Miracles had converted the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and afterwards Baptized them, S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> two of the Apostles, were sent to <hi>lay hands</hi> on them, upon which it is said, that <hi>they received the Holy Ghost,</hi> ver. 17. by which it appears that this Ministry of <hi>Confirmation</hi> appertained to the <hi>Apostles</hi>; since S. <hi>Philip,</hi> though a worker of <hi>Miracles,</hi> a <hi>Preacher,</hi> a <hi>Prime Deacon</hi>; and, if we may believe S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> one of the seventy two <hi>Disciples,</hi> would not presume to assume it, but left it to the <hi>Apostles</hi> as their <hi>peculiar</hi> Province: And accordingly in the Primitive Church it was always performed by the hands of the <hi>Bishops</hi>; for though from <hi>later</hi> Ages some probable instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are produced of some <hi>Presbyters</hi> that <hi>Confirmed</hi> in the <hi>Bishops absence,</hi> or by his <hi>delegation,</hi> yet in all Primitive Antiquity we have neither any one <hi>Canon,</hi> nor <hi>example</hi> of it; from whence we may
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:58668:236"/>
fairly conclude that this imposition of hands for <hi>Confirmation</hi> was <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, and to their <hi>Successors</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> in the continuation of it.</p>

               <p>HAving in the foregoing Section given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the several <hi>Ministers</hi> which Christ imploys in the Administration of his Kingdom, we proceed in the next place to inquire what those <hi>Acts of Royalty</hi> are, which he <hi>himself</hi> exerts in his Kingdom, and by which he perpetually rules and governs it; and these may be distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into three Orders:</p>
               <p>First, Such as he hath performed <hi>once</hi> for all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such as he hath <hi>always</hi> performed, and will <hi>still</hi> continue to perform.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Such as are <hi>yet to be</hi> peformed by him before the surrender of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>First, One sort of the <hi>Royal Acts</hi> of our Saviour are those which he hath performed <hi>once</hi> for all; and these are reducible to three particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. His giving <hi>Laws</hi> to his Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Mission of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to subdue mens minds to the obedience of those Laws and to govern them by them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His erecting an <hi>External Polity</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> in his Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:58668:236"/>I. One of those <hi>Regal Acts,</hi> which Christ hath performed in his Kingdom <hi>once</hi> for all, is giving <hi>Laws</hi> to it; and this he performed while he was upon Earth in those excellent <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses</hi> which he then preached and delivered to the World. For though he preached as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> yet it was as a <hi>Royal Prophet,</hi> as one that had <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> authority to <hi>Enact</hi> what he delivered into <hi>Laws</hi>; for he was a <hi>King</hi> while he was upon Earth, <hi>vid.</hi> p. 853, 854, &amp;c. so that all his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies</hi> were inforced with his <hi>Regal Authority,</hi> and he <hi>commanded</hi> as he was a <hi>King</hi> whatsoever he <hi>taught</hi> as he was a <hi>Prophet.</hi> Indeed, had he been a <hi>mere Prophet,</hi> he could not have <hi>obliged</hi> men by any <hi>Legislative Authority</hi> of his own to believe and obey him; his <hi>Declarations</hi> had had no farther Force in them than as they expressed the Will and Command of the <hi>Almighty Sovereign</hi> of the World, and if what he declared had not been <hi>Law before,</hi> it could not have been <hi>made Law</hi> by <hi>his declaring</hi> it. But being a <hi>Royal Prophet,</hi> his words were <hi>Laws,</hi> and all his Declarations carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>commanding</hi> power in them. And hence the Gospel is called the <hi>Law of Christ,</hi> Gal. 6.2. and <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life</hi> in or <hi>by Christ Iesus, Rom.</hi> 8.2. and that command of loving our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our self is called <hi>the Royal Law, i. e.</hi> the Law of Christ our King, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.8. for this our Saviour calls <hi>his Commandment,</hi> John 15.12. and <hi>his new Commandment,</hi> viz. <hi>that ye love one another even as I have loved you,</hi> Joh. 13.34. and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, but all other duties of the Gospel are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>his Commandments, Ioh.</hi> 14.21. and <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.20. by all which it is evident, that in revealing
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:58668:237"/>
his Gospel to the World he did not only perform the part of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> but also of a <hi>Legislator,</hi> and that by his own <hi>inherent</hi> Authority, as he was a <hi>King,</hi> he stamp'd those <hi>Doctrines</hi> into <hi>Laws</hi> which he taught and delivered as a Prophet. And such as his <hi>Kingly power</hi> is, such are his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>; he is a <hi>spiritual</hi> King, a King of <hi>Souls,</hi> of <hi>Wills,</hi> and of <hi>Affections,</hi> and accordingly his Laws are <hi>spiritual,</hi> and do extend their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Souls, and Wills, and Affections of his Subjects. For they not only oblige our <hi>outward</hi> man, but also the <hi>inmost</hi> motions of our heart, they lay their reins upon our <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>desires,</hi> as well as upon our <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> and give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to our inward <hi>intentions,</hi> as well as to our outward <hi>actions:</hi> so that to satisfie their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, it is not sufficient that we do well, unless we also <hi>intend</hi> well, that the <hi>matter</hi> of our actions be good, unless the <hi>aim</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of them be so also: for according to the tenor of these <hi>spiritual</hi> Laws, a bad <hi>intention</hi> unconsecrates the best <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and converts even our <hi>Prayers</hi> and our <hi>Alms</hi> into the most loathsom <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Dissimulations,</hi> vid. <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.16, 17, 18. and as they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige our inward <hi>intentions</hi> to good ends, so they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so restrain our inward <hi>concupiscence</hi> from evil ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, so far forth at least as it falls under the command and disposal of our Wills. For they not only forbid us the <hi>doing</hi> of evil actions, but also the <hi>consenting</hi> to them, and even the taking <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> in the contemplation of them, and the very <hi>affection</hi> to any bad action if it be voluntary and consented to, is in the construction of these Laws the same with the <hi>Commission</hi> of it; for so <hi>Hatred</hi>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:58668:237"/>
is construed <hi>Murder,</hi> 1 John 3.15. <hi>Covetousness, Theft</hi> or <hi>Robbery,</hi> Mark 7.22. <hi>inordinate lusting</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a woman <hi>Adultery,</hi> Mat. 5.28. and so in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral the wicked <hi>Will</hi> is in the construction of these Laws, the wicked <hi>action</hi> it chooses and consents to. Thus the Laws of our Saviour (to whose all-seeing eye our <hi>inmost</hi> motions are as obvious as our most <hi>open</hi> practice) do as well take notice of our vicious <hi>affections,</hi> those internal <hi>springs,</hi> and <hi>fountains</hi> of iniquity as of the vicious <hi>actions</hi> which stream out from them, and we are as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to them for harbouring the <hi>desire</hi> of sin, when we have not the convenience or opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>act</hi> it, for consenting to it (though we never commit it) when ever opportunity occurs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, and for indulging to our selves the <hi>Phantastick pleasures</hi> of sinful Meditations, which are but the <hi>antepasts</hi> of the actions, and as the Twilight to a dark night, but the first <hi>approaches</hi> towards the deeds of darkness, as for the <hi>sinful actions</hi> themselves. This therefore is the common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Laws of our Saviour, that they are all of them <hi>spiritual</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and do in the first place lay hold upon our <hi>Wills,</hi> and bind our <hi>inward-man,</hi> and from thence extend their obligation to the <hi>outward actions.</hi> They begin with that which is the <hi>Principle</hi> of all moral good and evil, and by rectifying the Spring and Wheels of our <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> within, communicate a regular motion to the hand of our <hi>practice</hi> without.</p>
               <p>But for our better understanding the <hi>nature</hi> of these <hi>Laws</hi> and the <hi>Obligations</hi> they devolve upon us, it will be necessary to consider them more particularly, they being all reducible under two
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:58668:238"/>
Heads; First, The Law of <hi>Perfection</hi>: And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The Law of <hi>Sincerity.</hi> Both which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us the <hi>same</hi> instances of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> though not in the <hi>same degree,</hi> nor under the <hi>same Penalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. There is the Law of <hi>Perfection,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the <hi>utmost</hi> degrees of every <hi>Christian Vertue,</hi> which in the several states and periods of our lives we are capable of attaining to. For so we are injoyned not only to <hi>do,</hi> but <hi>to abound in the work of the Lord</hi>; not only to <hi>have</hi> grace, but to <hi>grow</hi> in it, to <hi>perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord,</hi> and to <hi>be perfect as our Father in Heaven is perfect.</hi> For the nature of <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Standard</hi> of that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> whereunto we are obliged to aspire, and our growth in Piety and Vertue is never to come to a period, till we <hi>are pure as he is pure, and holy as he is holy, i. e.</hi> till we are arrived to <hi>infinite holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; which because our <hi>finite nature</hi> can never do in any period of Duration, therefore we are to be <hi>growing on</hi> to Eternity. So that this Law by prescribing <hi>no limits</hi> to the degrees of our growth, hath cut out work enough for us to imploy <hi>all</hi> our Faculties <hi>for ever.</hi> Not that it is a <hi>sin</hi> against it for a man to be <hi>short</hi> or <hi>defective</hi> of the <hi>utmost</hi> degree of <hi>perfection</hi>; for it requires no more of us than what is within our <hi>present possibility,</hi> which always increases proportionably to our present <hi>improvements.</hi> When we are arrived but to <hi>one</hi> degree of Vertue it is no <hi>sin</hi> against this Law of <hi>Perfection</hi> that we do not thence immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to <hi>six</hi> or <hi>seven,</hi> because it is not in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and no Law can oblige to an <hi>impossibility</hi>; but when we have acquired <hi>one,</hi> that gives us power
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:58668:238"/>
to acquire a <hi>second,</hi> and that a <hi>third,</hi> and so on <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> Thus our <hi>Obligation</hi> to be more and more perfect <hi>increases</hi> proportionably to the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement</hi> of our power; for the <hi>end</hi> of all power either to <hi>be</hi> good, or to <hi>do</hi> good, is to <hi>be</hi> good, and to <hi>do</hi> good; and therefore the <hi>more</hi> power we have to be good the <hi>better</hi> we ought to be, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise our power is in vain; while we are but <hi>Babes</hi> in Christ, or <hi>beginners</hi> in Religion, we have not that <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>power</hi> as when we are <hi>men,</hi> and have made a considerable <hi>progress</hi>; and therefore we are not <hi>then</hi> obliged to <hi>all</hi> those degrees of growth and perfection, but whatsoever degree is within our <hi>power</hi> in the different stages of our growth and progress, <hi>that</hi> we are actually and immediately <hi>obliged</hi> to; and so long as we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in <hi>it,</hi> we are <hi>offenders</hi> against the Law of <hi>Perfection.</hi> As for example, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.13. our Saviour commands us to <hi>love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our mind, and with all our strength</hi>; that is, that we should always love him as much as we <hi>can</hi>; but it is as much in our power to love him <hi>still more</hi> when we love <hi>much,</hi> as when we love him <hi>little</hi>; and so we are equally bound still to love him as much as we <hi>can,</hi> when we have <hi>ten</hi> degrees of <hi>power,</hi> as we were when we had but <hi>one.</hi> So that by this command we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged always to love God as much as we are <hi>able,</hi> and thereby to be always <hi>augmenting</hi> our ability to love him, and as our ability <hi>increases,</hi> to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways loving him <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> for ever. Now the <hi>Penalty</hi> by which this Law obliges us is not <hi>eternal damnation,</hi> (and God forbid it should, for then I doubt no flesh would be saved) but only
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:58668:239"/>
the <hi>deprivation</hi> of some <hi>degrees</hi> of future <hi>happiness,</hi> which is no more than what is the <hi>natural</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of all <hi>defects</hi> of <hi>goodness:</hi> for so essential is <hi>goodness</hi> to our future <hi>happiness,</hi> that proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as we fall short of the <hi>one</hi> we must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be defective of the <hi>other</hi>; and accordingly the Scripture tells us, that proportionably to our <hi>non-improvements</hi> in this life God will <hi>substract</hi> from our <hi>reward</hi> in the life to come. <hi>For he that sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sparingly,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>shall reap sparingly, and he that soweth abundantly shall reap abundantly,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.6. And our Saviour by a Parable doth expresly teach us that our future <hi>reward</hi> shall be <hi>apportioned</hi> to the degrees of our present <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Luk. 19. where he represents himself as a <hi>Master</hi> coming to take account of his Servants, among whom he had intrusted a stock of ten pounds, delivering to every one an equal share. The first by an <hi>extraordinary diligence</hi> had improv'd <hi>his</hi> Pound into ten, and he is rewarded <hi>according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> with the Government of ten Cities, <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. the other had been <hi>faithful,</hi> though not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so <hi>diligent,</hi> and by his <hi>one</hi> pound had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>five,</hi> and accordingly he is made Lord of <hi>five</hi> Cities, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19. By which he plainly declares, that by <hi>so much</hi> as we fall <hi>short</hi> of those <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> we might have made in Piety and Vertue, <hi>so much</hi> he will <hi>substract</hi> from our furure <hi>reward.</hi> So that the sense of the Law of perfection is this, as you would not incur the <hi>forfeiture</hi> of some <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of your <hi>happiness</hi> in the other life, be sure you imploy your <hi>utmost diligence</hi> in this to <hi>improve</hi> your selves in every grace and vertue of <hi>Religion.</hi>

                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:58668:239"/>II. There is the Law of <hi>sincerity,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the <hi>being</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> of all Christian Graces and vertues in us, together with the proper <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Exercises</hi> of them, as we have opportunity, and doth no farther forbid those <hi>gradual defects</hi> of them which are within our <hi>possibility</hi> to supply, than as they are the effects of our gross, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and wilful <hi>neglect,</hi> and so inconsistent with <hi>sincerity.</hi> Now the <hi>Reality</hi> of these Christian Vertues in us consists in the universal and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>resolution</hi> of our <hi>Wills</hi> to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our practice by them, so as not <hi>wilfully</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any thing that is <hi>contrary</hi> to them upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occasion or temptation whatsoever, and so long as this resolution continues <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>prevails</hi> in our practice, we are <hi>just</hi> in the eye and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Law of <hi>sincerity,</hi> though we do not always exert it to the <hi>utmost</hi> of our possibility.

               <p n="2">II. Of those <hi>Regal Acts</hi> which Christ hath performed in his Kingdom <hi>once</hi> for all, and that is his <hi>Mission</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to subdue Mens minds to the Obedience of his Laws, and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them by them. For so the Apostle makes the <hi>Mission</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> to succeed the <hi>Triumphal</hi> progress of our Saviour to his <hi>Coronation</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. <hi>He ascended up on high, he led capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity captive, he gave gifts unto Men</hi>; where by the <hi>gifts</hi> which he gave, we are to understand the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and in <hi>him</hi> all those <hi>extraordinary Gifts</hi> which he poured out upon his Church on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> for so <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33. S. <hi>Peter</hi> makes the effusion of the Spirit by Christ to be the consequence of his advancement to his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Royalty, <hi>therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear.</hi> Now the <hi>end</hi> for which he sent his Spirit, was to supply his room when he went from earth, and in his absence to preside as his <hi>Vicegerent</hi> in his Kingdom below. Since therefore this <hi>blessed Spirit</hi> acts as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours <hi>Agent,</hi> whatsoever <hi>he</hi> doth, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth <hi>by</hi> him. So that all those operations <hi>he</hi> performs in order to the subduing us to the obedience of Christ, and to the governing of us when we are subdued, are truly the operations of <hi>Christ himself.</hi> It is <hi>he</hi> that conquers and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns

us by <hi>his Spirit,</hi> our hearts are the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories which Christ invades by <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>his</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations are the <hi>victorious Arms</hi> by which Christ conquers and subdues them. Our Wills are the Thrones on which Christ sits, and rules, and governs by <hi>him,</hi> and his holy suggestions are the <hi>awful powers</hi> by which Christ himself commands our obedience. But what it is that this <hi>blessed Spirit</hi> doth, and hath done in order to the subduing Men to Christs Laws, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by them hath been already shewn at large: and therefore of this I shall need say no more at present.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And lastly, therefore, another of those <hi>Regal Acts</hi> which Christ hath <hi>once</hi> for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in his Heavenly Kingdom is, his erecting in it an <hi>external Polity</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi> What this <hi>Polity</hi> is, and what are the <hi>functions</hi> of it hath been shewn at large, and it is as well by this <hi>external</hi> Government, as by the <hi>internal</hi> Ministry of his Spirit, that Christ <hi>now</hi> rules his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for in all just and lawful things the lawful Governours of his Church do act by <hi>his</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and Authority, as being substituted by <hi>him</hi> the visible representatives of <hi>his</hi> Person, and the Executors and Administrators of <hi>his</hi> Power and Dominion. Whilst therefore they act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compass of their <hi>Commission,</hi> they act in <hi>his</hi> stead, and as <hi>his</hi> Vicegerents; and whatsoever they <hi>bind</hi> he <hi>binds,</hi> and whatsoever they <hi>loose</hi> he <hi>looses</hi>; their Commands are <hi>his,</hi> their Decrees and Sentences are <hi>his,</hi> and all their authoritative Acts carry with them the <hi>same force</hi> and <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> as if they had been performed by <hi>him</hi> in

For first the <hi>inferior</hi> Pastor, who hath the <hi>immediate</hi> Charge of it, and is obliged by his Office to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>instruct</hi> it by good Example and Doctrine, and to <hi>administer</hi> to it the holy Ordinances of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, stands accountable to Christ for <hi>every</hi> soul in it that miscarries through his <hi>neglect</hi> or <hi>omission</hi>; next, the <hi>Bishop</hi> stands accountable for not <hi>correcting</hi> the neglects and misdemeanours of the <hi>inferior</hi> Pastor, and then the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> for not taking <hi>Cognizance</hi> of the default of the Bishop. Thus in that <hi>excellent form</hi> of Government which Christ hath established in his Kingdom he hath made all possible provision for the safety and welfare of <hi>Souls</hi>; for according to this <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> he hath taken no less than a <hi>threefold</hi> secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, every one of which is as much as a Soul amounts to, that <hi>every Soul</hi> within every Cure shall be plentifully supplied with the means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that so none of them might miscarry,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:58668:243"/>
but such as are incorrigibly obstinate. So that now if <hi>any</hi> Soul within the Dominions of our Saviour perish for want of the means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, there are no less than <hi>three</hi> Souls one after another besides it self, <hi>accountable</hi> to him for its ruin. Having thus shewn what these <hi>Regal Acts</hi> are which Christ hath <hi>once</hi> for all performed in his Kingdom, I proceed</p>
               <p n="2">II. To declare what those <hi>Regal Acts</hi> are which he <hi>hath</hi> always performed, and doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continue to perform: and these are recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to four particulars:</p>
               <p>First, His <hi>pardoning</hi> penitent sinners.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His <hi>punishing</hi> obstinate Offenders.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His <hi>protecting</hi> and <hi>defending</hi> his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects in <hi>this</hi> life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, his <hi>blessing</hi> and <hi>rewarding</hi> them in the life <hi>to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. One of the <hi>Regal Acts</hi> which our Saviour always <hi>hath,</hi> and always <hi>continues</hi> to <hi>perform,</hi> is his <hi>pardoning</hi> and <hi>forgiving</hi> penitent sinners, which being one of the Articles of our <hi>Creed,</hi> I shall endeavour to give an account of it more at large; the Apostle defines sin to be a <hi>transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.4. Now the Law ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us under a certain <hi>stated</hi> Penalty to <hi>do</hi> and <hi>forbear</hi> what it <hi>commands</hi> and <hi>forbids</hi>; whenever therefore we <hi>transgress</hi> the Law, we are thereby obliged to undergo the <hi>Penalty</hi> it denounces; and this is that which we call the <hi>guilt of sin, viz.</hi> its obligation to punishment, and it is this <hi>guilt</hi> which <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>forgiveness</hi> relates to. For to <hi>pardon</hi> is nothing else but only to <hi>release</hi> the sinner from the obligation he lies under to suffer
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:58668:244"/>
the <hi>penalty</hi> of the Law. Now the <hi>penalty</hi> of the Law of God for every known and wilful sin is no less than <hi>everlasting perdition</hi>; and therefore from <hi>this</hi> it is that we are <hi>released</hi> by that <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>indemnity</hi> which the Gospel proposes. So that the <hi>pardon</hi> or <hi>remission</hi> of sins, whereof we are now treating, consists in the <hi>loosing</hi> of sinful men from that obligation <hi>to eternal punishment,</hi> whereunto they have rendered themselves liable by their wilful <hi>disobedience</hi> to the Law of God. Since therefore this <hi>pardon</hi> consists in the <hi>release</hi> of offenders from the <hi>penal Obligation</hi> of the Law it must be a <hi>Regal Act</hi>; because the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Law can be <hi>dispenced</hi> with by no other <hi>Authority</hi> but that which made it; and therefore since to <hi>make</hi> the Obligation of the Law is an Act of <hi>Regal Authority,</hi> to <hi>release</hi> or <hi>dispence</hi> with it must necessarily be <hi>so</hi> also; and accordingly <hi>forgiveness</hi> of sin is in Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to our Saviour as one of his <hi>Regal</hi> Rights, Acts 5.51. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour for to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to Israel and forgiveness of sin.</hi> So that now it is by <hi>Christ</hi> immediately that our sins are <hi>pardoned,</hi> and our Souls <hi>released</hi> from those Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to eternal <hi>punishment</hi> in which they have involved us: for <hi>the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son,</hi> Joh. 5.22. So that now it is by <hi>him</hi> immediately that the Father <hi>judgeth us, i. e.</hi> absolves and condemns us; for so <hi>Col.</hi> 3.13. the Apostle exhorts them to <hi>forbear and forgive one another even as Christ forgave them:</hi> and Col. 2.13. Christ is said to <hi>have forgiven them all trespasses.</hi> It is true, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:58668:244"/>
of sin is in Scripture frequently attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Father</hi> as well as to the <hi>Son</hi>: So 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confess our sins he</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Father) <hi>is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness; and</hi> Eph. 4.32. <hi>Forgiving one another even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven you.</hi> From whence it is plain that <hi>forgiveness</hi> of sin appertains to <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Christ,</hi> and that both have their <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate</hi> shares in it; and therefore since it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the same <hi>individual</hi> action should proceed from <hi>two distinct Agents</hi>; in this Act of <hi>forgiveness</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> must do something which the <hi>Son</hi> doth not, and the <hi>Son</hi> must do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which the <hi>Father</hi> doth not. They must both of them act an <hi>appropriate</hi> part in it, and each have a <hi>distinct</hi> agency from each other. For the fuller explication therefore of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle I shall endeavour to shew, first, what it is which the <hi>Father</hi> doth in forgiving sins, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what the <hi>Son</hi> doth.</p>
               <p n="1">I. What is it that the <hi>Father</hi> doth in this Act of forgiveness of sin? To which in short I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> part herein is to make a <hi>general grant</hi> of pardon to offenders, upon such a <hi>consideration</hi> as he shall think meet to accept, and with such a <hi>limitation</hi> and <hi>restriction</hi> he shall think fit to make; which <hi>general Grant</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but those glad tidings of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which he proclaimed to the World by Jesus Christ; <hi>viz.</hi> that in <hi>consideration</hi> of Christs <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> he would freely forgive all penitent and believing sinners their personal obligation to eternal punishment, and receive
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:58668:245"/>
them into grace and favour. So that in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving our sins there are these three things <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi> to God the <hi>Father:</hi> First, His making a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Grant</hi> of Pardon to us. Secondly, His ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it in <hi>consideration</hi> of Christs Death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Thirdly, His making it with those <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions</hi> and <hi>limitations</hi> of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>First, One thing <hi>peculiar</hi> to God the Father in forgiving sins is his making a <hi>general Grant</hi> of pardon and forgiveness to sinners. For the Law against which all men had sinned, and by which they were obliged to eternal punishment, was strictly and properly the Law of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> who being the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>supreme</hi> person in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> was consequently always the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>supreme</hi> in the <hi>divine Dominion.</hi> Now the <hi>divine Dominion</hi> consisting (even as all other Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do) of a <hi>Legislative</hi> and <hi>executive</hi> power, the <hi>Father</hi> must be <hi>supreme</hi> in <hi>both,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Laws</hi> of the divine Dominion must be more <hi>especially</hi> and <hi>peculiarly</hi> his. And hence it is called, <hi>The Will of the Father,</hi> Mat. 7.21. so in the Lords Prayer the Divine Law is in a <hi>peculiar</hi> manner stiled the Will of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Matth.</hi> 12.50. our Saviour stiles it, <hi>the Will of his Father which is in Heaven</hi>; and elsewhere the Commandment of his <hi>Father,</hi> vid. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.3.6. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.8, 9. by all which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the <hi>Divine Law</hi> against which we have all offended, and by which we are obliged to punishment is <hi>appropriately</hi> and <hi>peculiarly</hi> the Will and Commandment of <hi>God the Father</hi>; and it
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:58668:245"/>
being so, the right of <hi>exacting</hi> or <hi>remitting</hi> the punishment of this Law must be <hi>peculiarly</hi> and <hi>appropriately</hi> inherent in him. For the penalty of the Law is due to him whose Law it is, and it is he alone can <hi>loose</hi> us from it who <hi>bound</hi> it upon us; so that it was the <hi>Fathers</hi> peculiar, as to <hi>give</hi> the Law, so to <hi>indemnifie</hi> offenders from the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of it; and accordingly we find that publick <hi>Grant</hi> of <hi>pardon,</hi> which through Jesus Christ is made to sinners, is in Scripture every were attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the <hi>Father</hi>; so we are told that it is <hi>God</hi> who <hi>for Christs sake hath forgiven us,</hi> Eph. 4.32. and that it is <hi>God</hi> who <hi>hath set forth Christ to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation though faith in his bloud to declare his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness for the remission of sins that are past, that he might be just, and the justifier of them that believe in Iesus,</hi> Rom. 2.25, 26. that it was <hi>God</hi> who <hi>was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their trespasses unto them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. And in a word, that it is God who <hi>is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> 1 John 1.9. where his being <hi>faithful and just,</hi> plainly refers to some publick <hi>Grant</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> by which he hath <hi>obliged himself</hi> to penitent offenders. And indeed the whole <hi>new Covenant,</hi> in which this publick <hi>Grant</hi> of remission of <hi>sins</hi> is contained (<hi>vid.</hi> Heb. 8.12.) is the act and deed of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi>; It was <hi>he</hi> that in consideration of Christs Death and Sacrifice granted this grand <hi>Charter of mercy</hi> to the World; for seeing it was to the <hi>Father</hi> that that Sacrifice was <hi>offered,</hi> in consideration of <hi>which</hi> the <hi>new Covenant</hi> was granted (<hi>vid. Eph.</hi> 4.2. compared with <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20.) the grant of it must necessarily be from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  <pb n="466" facs="tcp:58668:246"/>
And as it was the Father that <hi>made</hi> this publick grant of Remission to sinners; so</p>
               <p n="2">II. It was he that made it in <hi>consideration</hi> of Christs Death and Sacrifice, for so Christ himself tells us, that it was by <hi>commandment which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his Father that he laid down his life, Iohn</hi> 10.17, 18. and when he was going to offer up himself upon the Cross he tells his Disciples, <hi>As the Father gave me Commandment even so do I, arise let us go hence, i. e.</hi> to execute that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which the Father hath given me, to <hi>lay down my life for the sheep, Ioh.</hi> 10.15. from whence it is evident, that it was the <hi>Father</hi> who exacted the Death and Sacrifice of Christ in consideration of that publick Grant of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which he made to the World; for it was <hi>through his blood that we have redemption, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sins, according to the Riches of his</hi> (i. e. the Fathers) <hi>grace, Eph.</hi> 1.7. and that blood of his was <hi>an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour,</hi> Eph. 5.2. So that it was God the Father that did both <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>accept</hi> the sacrifice of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which as I have shewed at large Sect. 4. was in consideration of his pardoning and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sinners.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And lastly, It was <hi>God the Father</hi> also that made this Grant of forgiveness to us with these <hi>restrictions</hi> and <hi>limitations</hi> of our believing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting For as the <hi>promises</hi> of the Covenant were <hi>his,</hi> in which remission of sin is proposed to us, so must the <hi>conditions</hi> of it be also, by which it is <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>restrained.</hi> Because it can belong to none but the <hi>giver</hi> to limit and conditionate his <hi>own</hi> Gifts and Grants: Now the <hi>Conditions</hi> of
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:58668:246"/>
our forgiveness are <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ather the condition of it is such a Faith, such a <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>active</hi> belief in Jesus Christ as doth beget in us <hi>sincere repentance</hi> and <hi>renovation</hi> of life; for so S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us again and again, that it is by <hi>faith</hi> that we are justified or pardoned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.24. Where by <hi>faith</hi> its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident he doth not mean any one <hi>single</hi> act of Faith, of what kind or denomination soever, but <hi>faith</hi> as it is the <hi>pregnant Root</hi> and <hi>active principle</hi> of <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>newness</hi> of life. For it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all hands, that that <hi>faith</hi> which acquits and justifies us before God must be <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>; and indeed unless it be so, it is not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable from <hi>persumption,</hi> which is only the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cass or lifeless image and Portraiture of Faith. So that if <hi>this</hi> be Justifying, it is all one whether you call it justifying <hi>faith</hi> or justifying <hi>presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; and he that can lay hold on the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ, though it be with <hi>prophane</hi> and <hi>sacrilegious</hi> hands, will be as certainly justified as the most <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>penitent</hi> soul. At which rate a man may <hi>rest</hi> upon Christ without coming <hi>to</hi> him, and <hi>lay hold</hi> upon him at the greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <hi>from</hi> him; he may lean upon his merits in open defiance to his <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>embrace</hi> and <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie</hi> him together. It being granted therefore, that that Faith which justifies us must be <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>operative</hi>; it is from hence most evident that the <hi>condition</hi> of our Justification is no one <hi>single</hi> act of Faith, but comprehends in it all that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and new <hi>Obedience</hi> which is the effect of the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>operation</hi> of Faith. For if to make it the condition of our Justification, it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:58668:247"/>
that our <hi>faith should work by</hi> Love and be operative and obediential; then that it should be <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>operative</hi> is as necessary to our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as that it should be <hi>faith</hi>; for where only an <hi>accident</hi> or <hi>mode</hi> of a thing is made a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>with</hi> the thing, it is <hi>equally</hi> a condition with the thing it self. As for instance, if I promise one such a reward upon condition he presents me with such a Book, <hi>so bound</hi> and of <hi>such</hi> an <hi>Edition,</hi> it is <hi>equally</hi> a condition and as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluential on the mans right to my <hi>promise,</hi> that it should be <hi>so bound</hi> and of <hi>such an Edition,</hi> as that it should be the <hi>Book</hi> for which I conditioned. And so in any other instance you can bring, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in fact or fiction, and the same reason holds good, whether we take Faith for a <hi>condition</hi> or an <hi>instrument</hi> (as some improperly enough call it) for if to be <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>operative</hi> is a <hi>necessary</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification to make Faith an <hi>instrument</hi> of our justification, then its <hi>liveliness</hi> and <hi>operation</hi> is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental</hi> too: For that <hi>mode</hi> of a thing which makes it instrumental is as <hi>really</hi> instrumental as the thing it <hi>self.</hi> As for instance, a <hi>Knife</hi> is an instrument of cutting, but it is its <hi>sharpness</hi> that makes it to be so, and therefore 'tis as instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to cutting that it should be <hi>sharp,</hi> as that it should be a <hi>Knife.</hi> And indeed whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider either the <hi>form</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> of our justification and pardon, it will evidently appear that <hi>that faith</hi> which justifies us must be such as includes in it <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and New <hi>Obedience.</hi> For as for the <hi>form</hi> of Justification it is a <hi>juridical</hi> act founded upon a <hi>legal</hi> process, in which there is always a <hi>Iudge,</hi> a <hi>Criminal</hi> and a <hi>Law,</hi> and here the Judge is <hi>God,</hi>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:58668:247"/>
the Criminal, <hi>man,</hi> the Law, the law of <hi>sincerity,</hi> or those affirmative and negative commands of the Christian Religion that are established with the threats of eternal condemnation; for so <hi>Iames</hi> 2.12. the Apostle tells us, that we must <hi>be judged by the Law of liberty,</hi> i. e. the moral Law, as it is expounded and perfected by our Saviour: for so <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>If ye fulfil the Royal law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self, ye do well.</hi> So that that <hi>Law of liberty</hi> by which we must be <hi>judged</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s this <hi>Royal Law,</hi> and this Royal Law is the <hi>moral Law</hi> which requires us to love our Neighbour as our selves; now this <hi>moral Law</hi> is to be considered under a <hi>twofold</hi> notion, as it is a Law of <hi>works,</hi> and as it is a Law of <hi>grace.</hi> As it is a law of <hi>works,</hi> it exacts perfect and unsinning <hi>obedience,</hi> and neither promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <hi>Grace</hi> to inable us to keep it, nor admits <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> when we have broken it. As it is a Law of <hi>grace</hi> it exacts only <hi>sincere obedience,</hi> and both promises <hi>grace</hi> to inable us thereunto and admits <hi>repentance,</hi> in case of wilful disobedience. Now considering it under the <hi>first</hi> notion, it is the same with the law of <hi>Nature,</hi> and as such, it obliges <hi>all men</hi> that are in the state of Nature or without the Pale of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, who have neither promise of <hi>grace</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to obey, nor yet of pardon upon <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> after they have once disobeyed it. In which forlorn condition they remain till such time as they embrace <hi>Christianity</hi> and are by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism admitted into the Kingdom of <hi>Christ,</hi> and from thenceforth the obligation of it, as it is a law of <hi>works</hi> ceaseth and it obliges them only as it is a Law of <hi>Grace, i. e.</hi> as it is a Law which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts of them only <hi>sincere obedience,</hi> and promises
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:58668:248"/>
both to <hi>assist</hi> them to obey, and upon their <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> to pardon their disobedience, so that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the <hi>moral Law,</hi> as it is a law of <hi>works,</hi> it neither <hi>justifies</hi> nor accounts just any but the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> innocent, nor yet indulges <hi>pardon</hi> to any that have offended upon <hi>any</hi> condition whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and therefore the Infidel World who alone are under the obligation of it, are said to be <hi>strangers from the Covenants of Promise having no hope,</hi> i. e. no hope founded upon Promise, none but what an <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>unpromised</hi> mercy affords them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. And then if we consider it, as it is a law of <hi>grace,</hi> it justifies or accounts just none but the <hi>sincerely obedient,</hi> and indulges par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to no offenders whatsoever, but such as are <hi>sincerely penitent</hi>; so that we Christians who alone are under the obligation of it can neither be <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> by it but upon our sincere <hi>obedience,</hi> nor when we fail of that be <hi>pardoned</hi> by it, but upon our <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned repentance.</hi> Since therefore it is by the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> law, considered as a Law of <hi>Grace,</hi> that God doth judge us, he can acquit us by it upon <hi>no other</hi> terms but only our performing of what it <hi>requires, i. e.</hi> our hearty <hi>repentance</hi> for our past sins and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere <hi>obedience</hi> for the future. For seeing it requires this of us under the penalty of <hi>eternal condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we are obliged by it to this penalty, till we have performed what it requires, and to be at the same time <hi>acquitted</hi> by a law and <hi>obliged</hi> to the <hi>Penalty</hi> of it is a contradiction; did this law of <hi>grace</hi> require of us nothing but <hi>faith,</hi> and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>condemnation</hi> for nothing but <hi>infidelity,</hi> then indeed our bare <hi>believing</hi> in Jesus were sufficient to <hi>discharge</hi> us from our obligation to its penalty;

but since it also requires of us <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience</hi> under the <hi>same</hi> Penalty that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>faith,</hi> our <hi>faith</hi> cannot be sufficient to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge</hi> us from its penalty, unless it be such as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>sincere obedience.</hi> In short, the law of <hi>grace</hi> condemns us as well for <hi>impiety, injustice</hi> and <hi>uncharitableness,</hi> as for <hi>infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; and therefore we cannot be acquitted by it upon forsaking our <hi>infidelity,</hi> unless we also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake our <hi>impiety,</hi> &amp;c. and while we continue in <hi>any one wilful sin</hi> for which it condemns, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that at the same time we should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted and pardoned by it; so that unless our <hi>faith</hi> be such as doth include in it a <hi>renuntiation</hi> of all <hi>wilful</hi> sin, or which is the same thing, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>sincere obedience,</hi> we cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted upon it by the Law of <hi>Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then if we consider the <hi>matter</hi> of our Pardon and Remission, which is nothing but a releasing us from our obligation to <hi>punishment,</hi> it will from thence also appear, that that <hi>faith</hi> upon which we obtain our pardon must be such as works in us <hi>sincere repentance</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi> For the <hi>punishment</hi> to which we are obliged by the Law of <hi>grace,</hi> consists in the <hi>loss of Heaven,</hi> as well as in the positive <hi>Torments of Hell</hi>; and therefore our <hi>pardon</hi> must include a <hi>release</hi> from <hi>both:</hi> but to be released from our obligation of <hi>losing Heaven</hi> is the same thing as to have a right of <hi>enjoying</hi> it confer'd upon us: so that the Faith upon which we are <hi>pardoned</hi> and <hi>forgiven</hi> is the Faith upon which we are <hi>intitled</hi> to Heaven as all agree, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>sincere obedience.</hi> For these two things are of undoubted certainty,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:58668:249"/>
that every man shall go to Heaven that dies <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled</hi> to it, and that no man shall go to Heaven that <hi>dieth</hi> in <hi>impenitence</hi> and <hi>wilful disobedience.</hi> For it is our keeping <hi>the Commandments of God that gives us a right to the Tree of life,</hi> Rev. 22.14. And our keeping Gods Commandments is that <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness without which no man shall see God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. And accordingly in Scripture the Remission of our sins is attributed to our <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> as well as to our <hi>faith:</hi> so <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</hi> And in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>If ye walk in the light as he is in the light you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, and the blood of Christ cleanseth you from all sin.</hi> So also <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34, 35. <hi>God is no respecter of persons, but in every Nation he that fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th him and worketh righteousness is accepted of him.</hi> From whence it is evident, that when the Scripture makes mention of <hi>faith only</hi> in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Justification, it is to be understood of <hi>faith</hi> in the greatest latitude, as comprehending <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>sincere obedience,</hi> for how can we be justified by <hi>faith only</hi> and yet be justified by <hi>obedience too,</hi> unless our <hi>obedience</hi> be <hi>included</hi> in our <hi>faith:</hi> and indeed the Scripture plainly declares that <hi>faith</hi> it self is <hi>not at all</hi> available with God, unless it be accompanied with sincere <hi>obedience.</hi> So <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>In Christ Iesus neither Circumcision availeth, nor Uncircumcision, but faith whick work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Love,</hi> and what he means by faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by love, he tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Circumcision is nothing, and Uncircumcision is nothing, but the new Creature,</hi> and what he means by the new Creature,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:58668:249"/>
he also tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Circumcision is nothing, and Uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God:</hi> so that the only thing which avails us with God is <hi>faith working by love.</hi> Faith working by Love is <hi>the new Creature,</hi> the new Creature is <hi>keeping the Commandments of God</hi>; and in <hi>Iames</hi> 2.26. we are told, that <hi>as the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the spirit is dead, so faith also is dead without works,</hi> that is, it is altogether ineffectual. For so if you compare the 14. and 17. Verses of this Chapter, you will find that those two phrases, <hi>faith cannot save,</hi> and <hi>faith is dead,</hi> do both signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the same thing. Since therefore <hi>faith</hi> it self without <hi>obedience</hi> is <hi>unavailable,</hi> when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture makes mention of our being <hi>justified by faith,</hi> it must necessarily be understood of <hi>faith, comprehending Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you see what <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Fathers</hi> part is in remitting our sins, <hi>viz.</hi> that it consists in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us an universal act of <hi>pardon,</hi> and <hi>Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> in <hi>consideration</hi> of our Saviours Sacrifice, and upon <hi>Condition</hi> of our sincere Repentance and future obedience. And this is the <hi>ground-work</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> of all remission of sins; without which our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself hath <hi>no right</hi> to pardon and forgive us; for since the Law against which we have all sinned was <hi>peculiarly</hi> from God the <hi>Father,</hi> as he is the <hi>fountain</hi> of Divinity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the <hi>head</hi> of the divine Dominion, it was <hi>he peculiarly</hi> that was the party <hi>offended,</hi> and consequently it was he to whom our obligation to <hi>punishment</hi> was due, and by whom alone it can be <hi>released</hi> and <hi>remitted</hi>; and as the <hi>grant</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was wholly in <hi>his</hi> will and pleasure; so
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:58668:250"/>
was it also to accept the <hi>consideration</hi> and appoint the <hi>Conditions</hi> of it. So that now as none can be pardoned but upon <hi>his Grant,</hi> so neither can his <hi>grant</hi> be available to any, but upon that <hi>conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> which he hath accepted, <hi>viz.</hi> the precious <hi>sacrifice</hi> of his own Son, and upon such <hi>conditions</hi> as he hath appointed, <hi>viz. faith</hi> working in us <hi>sincere repentance</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi>; and accordingly our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in all that he doth in the part he acts in forgiving sins, proceeds <hi>upon,</hi> and <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to this Grant of his <hi>Father:</hi> for 'tis in the right and upon the <hi>consideration</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> of this Grant that he forgives us, nor can he forgive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by <hi>any other</hi> right than that which it gives him, or upon any other <hi>consideration</hi> than that which <hi>it</hi> hath admitted, or upon any other <hi>condition</hi> than that which <hi>it</hi> hath specified and determined. And this brings me to the <hi>second</hi> Head I proposed, which was to shew what it is that the <hi>Son</hi> doth in forgiving Sins.</p>
               <p>In short therefore, the part which our <hi>Saviour</hi> bears in it, consider'd as <hi>King</hi> under God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is to make an <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>particular application</hi> of this <hi>general Grant</hi> of his Father to particular Sinners upon their <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi> For the <hi>Fathers grant</hi> is only a <hi>general promise</hi> that we shall be pardoned for Christs sake, whenever we <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely believe</hi> and <hi>repent</hi>; but the <hi>actual</hi> pardoning us consists in the <hi>application</hi> of this general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to us in particular, by which the <hi>general</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of pardon is converted into a <hi>particular</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of pardon. For the <hi>promise</hi> says thus, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever believes</hi> and <hi>repents</hi> shall be pardoned; the particular <hi>application</hi> of the Promise says thus,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:58668:250"/>
                  <hi>Thou</hi> doest <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>repent,</hi> and therefore by vertue of that Promise I <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>forgive thee.</hi> And this is the <hi>proper part</hi> of our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> who having <hi>first</hi> obtained this Promise of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his <hi>sacrifice</hi> upon Earth, and then still <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing</hi> to obtain of him by his continual <hi>intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in Heaven, <hi>Royal Authority</hi> to <hi>dispense</hi> that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to us, doth by vertue of that <hi>Authority actually pardon</hi> us upon our <hi>actual repentance.</hi> So that as soon <hi>as</hi> ever we perform the <hi>condition</hi> of Gods grant of pardon, our Saviour (who <hi>knows</hi> the inmost thoughts of our hearts and perfectly <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerns</hi> our sincerity) <hi>immediately pronounces</hi> our sentence of pardon, and by a particular <hi>applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of that general grant to us, <hi>absolves</hi> us from our obligation to eternal <hi>punishment,</hi> and freely <hi>receives</hi> us into <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour.</hi> For though the <hi>completion</hi> and <hi>publication</hi> of our pardon is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for the day of <hi>judgment,</hi> when we shall be <hi>absolved</hi> from all punishment, (<hi>i. e.</hi> not only of <hi>eternal</hi> misery, but also of <hi>corporal</hi> death and temporal sufferings) in the publick view and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the World; yet it is certain that every penitent Believer in Jesus is actually pardoned by him in Heaven, <hi>as soon</hi> as ever he believes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; that is, he is, <hi>in foro Christi</hi> and before the Tribunal of his Royal Judgment <hi>Absolved</hi> from the obligation to suffer <hi>eternal</hi> misery which he lay under during his state of <hi>impenitence</hi>; and Christ in his own mind, judgment and estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath, Judicially thus pronounced concerning him, <hi>By vertue of my Fathers grant to all penitent offenders and of that Royal Authority which he hath committed to me, I freely release thee from all that
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:58668:251"/>
vast debt of everlasting punishment which thou hast too justly incurr'd by sinning against him.</hi> Thus as the <hi>Father</hi> forgives us <hi>vertually</hi> by that <hi>publick</hi> grant of mercy which for Christs sake he hath made to all penitent offenders; so the <hi>Son</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives us <hi>actually</hi> by that Royal Authority which the Father hath given him to make a <hi>particular</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that his general grant to us upon our actual <hi>repentance</hi>; and as it is by the <hi>Fathers grant</hi> that the <hi>Son</hi> pardons us, so it is by the <hi>Sons appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of it that the <hi>Father</hi> pardons us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are said <hi>in</hi> or <hi>by</hi> Christ to <hi>have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin,</hi> Col. 1.14. <hi>i. e.</hi> to be forgiven for the sake of his blood, in consideration whereof God the Father hath given him power to forgive us; for so he himself tells us, that <hi>all power in Heaven and Earth was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him,</hi> Matth. 28.18. and there is no doubt but in <hi>all power,</hi> the power of forgiving sins was included; for so S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that <hi>through his Name,</hi> i. e. by his Authority or judicial sentence, <hi>Whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins,</hi> Acts 10.43.</p>
               <p>And thus you see what the <hi>first Regal</hi> act is, which our Saviour <hi>hath</hi> always performed and will always <hi>continue</hi> to perform, <hi>viz.</hi> forgiving of sins.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Another of his <hi>Regal acts</hi> of this kind is, <hi>punishing</hi> obstinate offenders: For as he <hi>mediates</hi> for his Father in ruling and governing us, he must be the Minister of his Fathers <hi>providence,</hi> and being so, whatsoever <hi>divine punishments</hi> are inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon offenders, are to be look'd upon as the <hi>stroaks</hi> of <hi>his</hi> hand and the Ministries of <hi>his</hi> power,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:58668:251"/>
for <hi>he hath the Keys of Death and Hell,</hi> i. e. the power of punishing both here and hereafter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. and accordingly he threatens the corrupt Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> that <hi>he would remove their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick,</hi> and that <hi>he would fight against them with the sword of his mouth,</hi> that <hi>he would come upon them as a Thief,</hi> and that <hi>he would spew them out of his mouth,</hi> Rev. 2.5.3.16. <hi>and</hi> Chap. 3. Vers. 16. all which is a sufficient proof that the <hi>punishment</hi> of offenders both here and hereafter is committed to him as a <hi>branch</hi> of that <hi>Royal Authority</hi> with which he is invested by the Father; in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which Commission he many times Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens bad men in this life in order to their refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and amendment; for <hi>as many as I love</hi> saith he, (<hi>i. e.</hi> wish well to) <hi>I rebuke and chasten,</hi> Heb. 3.19. and many times he persecutes them with <hi>exterminating</hi> judgments, thereby hanging them up in Chains, as it were, as publick <hi>examples</hi> of his vengeance, to warn and deter the World from treading in their impious footsteps. For so he threatens <hi>Iezebel</hi> and her followers; <hi>I gave her space to repent of her fornications and she repented not; behold, I will cast her into a bed,</hi> i. e. into a Bed-rid and irrevocable condition <hi>and them that commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery with her into great tribulation, and I will kill her Children with death, and all the Church shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and heart, and I will give unto every one of you according to your works,</hi> Rev. 2.21, 22, 23. And though for <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> ends he oftentimes <hi>spares</hi> bad men in <hi>this</hi> life, and sometimes shines upon them a continued day of prosperity, without any cloud or interruption; yet he always <hi>overtakes</hi> them
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:58668:252"/>
with the fearful storms of his vengeance in the life <hi>to come.</hi> For no sooner do their souls depart from their bodies, but they are immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by <hi>his warrant</hi> into the hands of evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> those skilful spiteful, and powerful <hi>executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of his justice, under whose savage Tyranny they indure all the tortures and Agonies that the wrath and power of <hi>Devils,</hi> together with their own awakened <hi>consciences</hi> and furious and unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied <hi>affections</hi> are able to inflict. Of which see Part 1. Ch. 3. For that the souls of bad men are transmitted into a state of wretchedness and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery <hi>immediately</hi> upon their separation from their bodies is evident from the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> wherein in the first place <hi>Dives</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after his death is said to be <hi>in great torment in Hell,</hi> and this while his body lay buried in the grave, <hi>Luk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 16.22, 23. which is a plain argument that in all that <hi>interval</hi> between death and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the body, the souls of bad men abide in a state of <hi>torment</hi>; for secondly, this torment of <hi>Dives</hi>'s soul in hell was <hi>then</hi> when his Brethren were <hi>living</hi> upon earth and under the teaching of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets <hi>ver.</hi> 27. and 28, 29, 30, 31. which shews that our Saviour supposes it to be at <hi>that</hi> very <hi>time</hi> when he delivered this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and consequently he supposes all bad men who were <hi>then dead</hi> and whose condition he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents by that of <hi>Dives</hi> to be <hi>then in Hell,</hi> and there suffering unspeakable <hi>Agonies</hi> and <hi>Torments:</hi> and if so, then it's plain, that when ever <hi>impenitent</hi> souls leave their bodies they are carried by Devils into some dismal abode and there kept under a perpetual discipline of torment; and in this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable</hi>
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:58668:252"/>
state they remain expecting that <hi>fearful day</hi> of accounts, when their condition, through their <hi>reunion</hi> to their bodies and that dread <hi>bodily Torment,</hi> they must then be condemned to, will be rendered yet far more intolerable.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Another of those <hi>Regal Acts</hi> which our Saviour <hi>hath</hi> always, and always will <hi>continue</hi> to perform, is his <hi>protecting</hi> and <hi>defending</hi> his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in this World. For thus he promises his faithful Church of <hi>Philadelphia, Because thou hast kept the word of my Patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the World to try them that dwell upon the Earth,</hi> Rev. 3.10. By which it is plain, that the power of <hi>protecting</hi> and <hi>defending</hi> his Subjects is inherent in Christ as an <hi>essential</hi> part of his <hi>Regal Authority</hi>; and this power he continually exercises now he is is heaven; for it was for this end among others that he promises to be with his Church to the end of the World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. namely to <hi>guard</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> it by his Providence against the outragious attempts of its numerous enemies. For it is for this end that the Father <hi>hath put all things in subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction under him, and that he hath left nothing that is not put under him,</hi> Heb. 2.7, 8. that so having the Universal Government of all things in his hand he might by his over-ruling Providence ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them all subservient to the interest of his Church. For so <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21. we are assured that the Father <hi>hath put all things under his feet, and given him to be head over all things to his Church,</hi> i. e. hath vested him with an universal power over all things, that so he might order and direct them all to the interest and advantage of his Church. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:58668:253"/>
now he is in heaven, the <hi>defence</hi> and <hi>preservation</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> is the great business which he intends upon earth: there he now sits looking down from his Throne with a watchful eye to <hi>observe</hi> all the motions, and trace out all the dark designs of her <hi>enemies,</hi> and from thence he stretches forth his Almighty hand to guard and defend her against them, to repel or over-rule their malice, to drive back their venemous Darts upon themselves, or to temper their Poyson into Physick, and extract a healing Balm out of the Stings of those Scorpions. In which how <hi>careful</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> he hath been is abundantly manifest from the glorious <hi>success:</hi> for considering the vast opposition that hath been made against it even from its infancy, how is it possible it could ever have subsisted had it not been guarded by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible hand? No sooner did this <hi>light upon a Hill</hi> appear in the World but all the four Winds im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conspired to blow it out, yet, (which is miraculous to consider,) still the harder they blew the brighter it flamed; and though for the first 300 years it was the main and almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant exercise of the Power and Policy, the Wit and Cruelty both of <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> to suppress and ruine it, yet still it <hi>thrived</hi> and <hi>encreased</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the most powerful means of its <hi>extirpation.</hi> It <hi>conquered</hi> by <hi>suffering,</hi> gathered <hi>strength</hi> by <hi>bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and, like a head-strong Floud, still the more it was <hi>checked</hi> the more it <hi>swelled</hi> and over-flowed, till at length it <hi>filled the Earth as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi> Which, if well considered, is an amazing instance of the <hi>vigilant</hi> and <hi>powerful Providence</hi> of our Saviour, which hath not only <hi>preserved</hi>
                  <pb n="481" facs="tcp:58668:253"/>
this burning Bush from consuming, but made it <hi>spring</hi> and <hi>flourish</hi> in the flames. And though since those <hi>Primitive</hi> Persecutions he hath many times for wise and gracious ends let <hi>loose</hi> the Wolves upon his Flock, and permitted them to worry, and sometimes almost to devour it, yet still he hath kept a strict and steady <hi>Reign</hi> upon their Power and Malice, and when they have served his ends, hath check'd and stop'd them in their savage career, and when they have thought the trembling Prey their own, hath stretched out his own Almighty Arm, and snatched it from their devouring jaws. So that while they are clubbing all their Power and Policy against it, <hi>he that sits in the Heavens laughs them to scorn, the Lord hath them in derision,</hi> and doth contemn their impotent malice, which <hi>he</hi> can manage as <hi>he</hi> pleases; he can either <hi>prevent</hi> the mischievous effects of it, or cause them to <hi>recoile</hi> upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or make those very <hi>persecutions,</hi> with which they design to <hi>destroy</hi> his Church, the means of its <hi>enlargement</hi> and <hi>propagation</hi>; and what in his own <hi>infallible</hi> Wisdom he thinks best, that he hath always done, and will always do for his Church and People: For <hi>many a time have they afflicted me from my youth may Israel,</hi> or the Church of Christ, <hi>now say, many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, yet have they not prevailed against me, the Plowers have plowed upon my back, they have made long furrows, but the Lord is righteous, he hath cut asunder the Cords of the wicked, and in his own due time will confound and turn back those that hate Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

These are his <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,</hi> and he keeps them in his Treasury under the <hi>strongest</hi> and most <hi>inviolable</hi> security. He is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways watching over them for good, and it is his <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>continual</hi> concern to protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, to keep off Temptation from their <hi>Souls,</hi> and Calamities from their <hi>Bodies,</hi> and so to over-rule and direct the course of things, as that whatever befals them may concenter in their <hi>happiness.</hi> For though he many times <hi>corrects</hi> them with his <hi>own</hi> hand, and <hi>permits</hi> them to be oppressed and afflicted by <hi>others,</hi> yet still he doth it with a most <hi>gracious</hi> intention, either to <hi>cure</hi> or <hi>prevent</hi> some disease in their minds, or to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> their <hi>graces,</hi> or to <hi>wean</hi> them from the love of <hi>this</hi> vain World, and <hi>discipline</hi> them for a blessed <hi>Eternity</hi>; and whatsoever evils happen to them in the course of his Providence,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:58668:254"/>
still he takes care to extract <hi>good</hi> out of them, and so to contrive and order the whole Scene of Affairs, as that in the issue <hi>all things may still work together for good to them that love God, and are called according to his purpose,</hi> Rom. 8.28.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And lastly, Another of those <hi>Regal Acts</hi> which our Saviour <hi>hath</hi> always, and <hi>doth</hi> always <hi>continue</hi> to perform, in his <hi>blessing</hi> and <hi>rewarding</hi> all his faithful Subjects in the Life to come; for this, as he himself declares, he hath power to do, so <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To him that overcomes, will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God, i. e.</hi> I will admit him in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the blessed immortality of Heaven; so also <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. <hi>To him that overcomes, will I grant to sit with me on my Throne, even as I have overcome, and am sate down with my Father on his Throne</hi>; And he promises the Bishop of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> in particular, <hi>Be thou faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the death, and I will give thee a crown of life,</hi> Rev. 2.10. In all which places he expresly declares his <hi>Royal</hi> Authority to <hi>reward</hi> his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects, when they leave this World with the <hi>joys</hi> and <hi>felicities</hi> of the World to come; and this Authority <hi>he</hi> is <hi>continually</hi> exercising in his heavenly Kingdom. For when ever any <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>obedient Souls</hi> depart from their bodies, he presently sends forth his <hi>Angelick Messengers</hi> to <hi>conduct</hi> them safe to the immortal Regions, and there to lodge them in some one of those <hi>blissful Mansions</hi> in his Fathers House which he went before to prepare for them; where free from all the disturbances of <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:58668:255"/>
of a vexatious and tumultuous World, they live in continued <hi>ease, content,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> wrapt up with the ever-growing <hi>delights</hi> of <hi>contemplating, loving,</hi> and <hi>imitating</hi> God, and of the most wise and amicable <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>Communication</hi> with each other, in the enjoyment of an endless <hi>bliss</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi>; for so we are assured from Scripture that the happiness of the righteous doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence from the <hi>moment</hi> of their departure hence. So Rev. 14.13. <hi>Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours, and their works do follow them</hi>; and with St. <hi>Paul</hi> it was the same thing to <hi>depart from hence and to be with Christ, Phil.</hi> 1.23. which necessarily implies, that upon his departure he expected to be <hi>immediately</hi> with Christ; and elsewhere he teaches, that <hi>to be at home in the body was to be absent from the Lord, and to be absent from the body to be present with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.6, 8. neither of which can be true if the Souls of good men go not to Heaven im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately when they go from hence: but that they do so is as plain as words can express it, in that promise of our Saviour to the Penitent Thief, <hi>Verily verily I say unto thee this day shalt thou be with me in Paradise,</hi> Luke 23.43. From whence it evidently follows, that even in the very <hi>Article</hi> of a true Penitents death, Heavens joys do <hi>attend</hi> his departing Soul to receive it <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> when it is dislodged from the body. Thus in the very <hi>moment</hi> of its departure hence the Pious Soul is transported to those <hi>blessed abodes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Stars, which are the proper seat and pure Element of <hi>Happiness,</hi> where the blessed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:58668:255"/>
live in a <hi>continued fruition</hi> of their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most wishes, being every moment entertained with <hi>fresh</hi> and <hi>enravishing</hi> Scenes of pleasure, where all their happiness is <hi>eternal,</hi> and all their eternity nothing else but only one <hi>continued</hi> Act of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Praise,</hi> and <hi>Ioy,</hi> and <hi>Triumph,</hi> where there are no <hi>sighs</hi> or <hi>tears,</hi> no intermixtures of <hi>sorrow</hi> or <hi>misery,</hi> but <hi>every heart</hi> is full of <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>every joy</hi> is <hi>Quintessence,</hi> and every happy <hi>moment</hi> is crowned with some <hi>fresh</hi> and <hi>new</hi> enjoyment. But of this blessed state I have given an account at large, <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. and 3. And this is that blessed <hi>reward</hi> with which our Saviour crowns his faithful Subjects <hi>immediately</hi> upon their departure hence; so that he doth not permit them to <hi>lie sleeping</hi> in the dust <hi>unrewarded,</hi> till the end of the World, but as soon as they have <hi>finished</hi> their work upon Earth, admits them to <hi>the joy of their Master,</hi> to all the felicities that their <hi>separated</hi> spirits are capable of in those several <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> and <hi>measures</hi> of perfection which they there arrive to; in which happy state they remain du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their <hi>separation</hi> from the body, expecting the farther <hi>completion</hi> of their happiness in a glorious <hi>Resurrection,</hi> by which their Bodies and Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reunited, their whole <hi>Humane Nature</hi> shall be <hi>filled</hi> with bliss to the utmost stretch of its <hi>Capacity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now having shewn what those <hi>Regal Acts</hi> are which Christ <hi>hath</hi> always performed, and doth always <hi>continue</hi> to perform, I proceed in the</p>
               <p n="3">III. And last place, To shew what those <hi>Regal Acts</hi> are which are <hi>yet to be</hi> performed by him, before he surrenders up his Kingdom; and these are reducible to three Heads:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:58668:256"/>First, He is <hi>yet</hi> farther to <hi>extend</hi> and <hi>enlarge</hi> his Kingdom by the Conquest of its enemies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He is <hi>yet</hi> to destroy <hi>Death,</hi> the last Enemy, by giving a general Resurrection.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He is <hi>yet</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> the World.</p>
               <p n="1">I. He is yet farther to <hi>extend</hi> and <hi>enlarge</hi> his Kingdom by a more universal conquest of its Enemies. For if we consult the ancient Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies concerning the vast extent of our Saviours Kingdom, we shall find that there are a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them which as yet were never <hi>accomplished.</hi> So <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>Ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the Earth for thy possession, thou shalt break them with a Rod of Iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces like a Potters Vessel,</hi> whereas hitherto it is certain Christ was never possessed of <hi>the uttermost parts of the earth</hi>; nor did he ever yet break his incorrigible opposers <hi>with a Rod of Iron, or dash them in pieces like a Potters Vessel</hi>; so also <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.4. it is foretold of Christ, that <hi>there should be given him Dominion, and Glory, and Kingdom, that all People, Nations, and Languages should serve him,</hi> and that <hi>all Dominion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>all Kings should fall down before him, and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions serve him,</hi> ibid. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and that <hi>all the ends of the earth should remember and turn to the Lord, and all the kindreds of the Nations worship before him, because the Kingdom shall be the Lords, and he shall govern among the Nations.</hi> These, and sundry other such like Prophesies there are which as <hi>yet</hi> it is certain, were never <hi>accomplished</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the full import and intent of them. Wherefore we may certainly conclude that there is a time <hi>yet to come</hi> before the consummation of all things, wherein our Saviour will yet <hi>once more</hi> display the victorious Banner of his Cross, and like a mighty man of War march on <hi>conquering and to conquer,</hi> till he hath confounded or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his Enemies, and finally <hi>consummated</hi> his victories in a <hi>glorious Triumph</hi> over all the Powers of the Earth.

hath the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> in him, which <hi>power</hi> to be sure will not be always in vain, but one time or other will most certainly be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into <hi>Act:</hi> For so the Apostle assures us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raised up Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in us.</hi> And indeed considering that Christ in <hi>dying</hi> and <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> from the dead acted as our <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,</hi> we may justly conclude, that as when he <hi>laid down his life,</hi> he laid it down for ours; so when he <hi>took it up</hi> again, he took up <hi>ours</hi> with it; and consequently that he <hi>vertually</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>us</hi> by the <hi>same</hi> Spirit whereby he <hi>actually</hi> raised <hi>himself:</hi> because he hath not only <hi>Power,</hi> but also <hi>Will,</hi> as he is our <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> to raise <hi>us</hi> even as he raised <hi>himself.</hi> So that we are <hi>already</hi> risen in our causes since our <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Representative</hi> is risen, and hath the <hi>same power</hi> to raise <hi>us</hi> as he had to raise <hi>himself</hi>; and hence he is called, <hi>the first-born from the dead</hi>; and we <hi>the Sons of the Resurrection,</hi> Col. 1.18. because our Resurrection is now in the <hi>same</hi> causes (that is, in the same <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi>) as his was before he arose. And therefore also he is called <hi>the first fruits of them that rise,</hi> that is, the <hi>pledge</hi> and <hi>handsel</hi> of the general Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; because he is risen with the <hi>same Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to raise <hi>us,</hi> that he had when he arose, to raise <hi>himself</hi>; and hence we find the Apostle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues from the Resurrection of <hi>Christ</hi> to the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Resurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. <hi>Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:58668:260"/>
among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?</hi> If we are all agreed that <hi>Christ</hi> is risen, what reason can any man have to doubt of the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Resurrection? <hi>But if there be no resurrection from the dead, then is Christ not risen,</hi> ver. 13. To say that <hi>we</hi> shall not rise, is by consequence to deny the resurrection of <hi>Christ,</hi> because that very <hi>same will</hi> and <hi>power</hi> which must have been the cause of <hi>Christs</hi> resurrection; if <hi>he</hi> be risen, must be the cause of <hi>ours,</hi> if ever <hi>we</hi> rise; and therefore if it be insufficient to raise <hi>us,</hi> it could never have been sufficient to raise <hi>him,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently <hi>he</hi> cannot be risen. If it be objected against this reasoning of the Apostle, that <hi>our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> will be far more <hi>difficult</hi> to accomplish than <hi>Christs</hi> was, because <hi>his</hi> body was never <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,</hi> nor were the parts of it ever <hi>dispersed,</hi> as <hi>ours</hi> will be, long before the resurrection; and therefore that cause which was <hi>sufficient</hi> to raise <hi>Christ,</hi> may <hi>not</hi> be <hi>sufficient</hi> to raise <hi>us:</hi> It may easily be answered, that to the <hi>infinite power</hi> by which Christ was raised, all possible things are <hi>equally easie</hi>; and therefore allowing our resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to be but <hi>possible,</hi> it must be every whit as <hi>easie</hi> to that <hi>infinite power</hi> by which Christ was raised, to <hi>reduce</hi> all our scattered atoms into one mass again, and to <hi>reorganize</hi> them into a humane body and <hi>reunite</hi> it to its ancient soul, as it was to quicken the yet <hi>uncorrupted</hi> body of our Saviour. So that all the question is whether the thing be <hi>possible,</hi> for if it be, it will be every whit as <hi>easie</hi> to the <hi>omnipotent</hi> cause of our Saviours resurrection, to raise <hi>our</hi> bodies as it was to raise <hi>his.</hi> But, I beseech you, why should it be thought
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:58668:260"/>
more <hi>impossible</hi> for God to <hi>raise</hi> a dead corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted body, whose parts are all <hi>dispersed</hi> and <hi>scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi> throughout the vast wilderness of matter, and <hi>reunite</hi> it to its primitive soul, than it was at first to <hi>create</hi> the matter of it, and then <hi>form</hi> it into a humane body and <hi>animate</hi> it with a humane soul? He who at the <hi>first cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> could <hi>separate</hi> the <hi>confused mass</hi> of matter into so many distinct <hi>kinds</hi> and <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of Beings, can doubtless at the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral resurrection as easily <hi>separate</hi> the <hi>same matter</hi> into its distinct and several <hi>individuals.</hi> For, what should hinder him who numbers the <hi>stars</hi> of the Heavens, the <hi>sands</hi> of the Sea and the <hi>hairs</hi> of our heads, from keeping an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all our <hi>scattered particles,</hi> and from knowing what <hi>dust</hi> belongs to every <hi>body,</hi> and what <hi>body</hi> to every <hi>soul?</hi> Or how can it be <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult</hi> to him, whose <hi>power</hi> is as <hi>immense</hi> as his <hi>knowledg,</hi> to recollect all the <hi>parts</hi> of this curious piece of Clockwork which he both made and took in sunder, and to <hi>restore</hi> every <hi>pin</hi> into its proper place, every <hi>spring</hi> to its due vigour and activity, and every <hi>wheel</hi> to its primitive figure and motion? If it be farther objected that there is an <hi>impossibility</hi> in the <hi>nature</hi> of the thing, for the <hi>same</hi> dead body after it is <hi>corrupted</hi> and its parts all <hi>disperst,</hi> to be <hi>reunited</hi> and raised to <hi>life</hi> again; I answer, that since these dispersed <hi>parts</hi> of our bodies do not <hi>perish,</hi> but are safely <hi>laid up</hi> in the Chambers of Nature, however they are <hi>scattered</hi> or wherever <hi>lodged,</hi> they are all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ken of Gods <hi>knowledg</hi> and within the reach of his <hi>power</hi>; and so long as they are <hi>so,</hi>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:58668:261"/>
why should their <hi>separation</hi> render it <hi>impossible</hi> for them to be <hi>reunited</hi> how and when he pleases? If you say, that in that <hi>perpetual</hi> course of <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation</hi> which the matter of humane bodies runs, it may happen, and sometimes doubtless it <hi>doth,</hi> that the <hi>same particles</hi> at several times are incorporated into <hi>several</hi> bodies; As for instance, when <hi>one</hi> man eats either the flesh or that which hath the flesh or substance of <hi>another</hi> in it, and digests it into a part of his <hi>own</hi> body and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in which case how is it possible at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection that the substance or matter of <hi>this part</hi> should be reunited to them <hi>both?</hi> To this I answer, that considering that scarce the <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth</hi> part of what we eat is <hi>digested</hi> into the substance of our bodies, and that all the rest we <hi>render back</hi> again into the <hi>common mass</hi> of matter by sensible or insensible evacuations; though we should suppose one man to have eaten up the whole substance of anothers body, yet he retains but <hi>one</hi> part of an <hi>hundred,</hi> and what should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an <hi>omnipotent power</hi> from raising the body he hath devoured out of the ninety nine parts which he lets go again? And then considering that in seven years time the whole <hi>substance</hi> of our body <hi>Changes,</hi> he must if he live so long evacuate that <hi>one</hi> part which he retain'd, and so the <hi>whole</hi> will be at last <hi>worn off</hi> from the matter and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his body. Nay, suppose this Devourer to feed altogether upon <hi>mans</hi> flesh, as some affirm the <hi>Canibals</hi> do, and that in the last seven years before his death, he devours <hi>one hundred</hi> humane bodies weighing <hi>two hundred pound</hi> a piece; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this computation the utmost he can
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:58668:261"/>
be supposed to digest of the flesh of these <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> bodies into the substance of his own, amounts not to above <hi>two pound</hi> of each, so that of the <hi>two hundred</hi> weight of bodily substance whereof these devoured bodies did consist, there will still remain <hi>one hundred ninety eight</hi> undigest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the substance of the Devourer; which we may easily conceive is <hi>sufficient</hi> matter out of which to re-produce the same bodies: For we many times lose as much of our substance in a <hi>sweat,</hi> and a great deal more in a <hi>consumption</hi> as these devoured bodies do in their being eaten and digested; notwithstanding which our bodies continue <hi>numerically</hi> the same; But as for the bodies of these <hi>Man-eaters</hi> there is no doubt but they carry with them a great deal of <hi>other</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to their graves besides that of mans flesh; for the <hi>liquor</hi> which they drink with it, and the <hi>bread</hi> which they eat with it, and the other <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental nourishments</hi> which they receive with it, goes into the substance of their bodies as well as <hi>that</hi>; and these being at least one half of their <hi>nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> must constitute at least one half of their <hi>bodies.</hi> What then should hinder but that at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection the other half of them which consists of mans flesh may be separated from them and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to those humane bodies they devoured; and if so, then each of them shall recover its <hi>whole</hi> substance again, and not want so much as <hi>one particle</hi> of all that matter whereof they were composed when they were eaten; for it is but just that they should be made to refund those unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral spoils which they barbarously ravished from the bodies of other men. But then you will say,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:58668:262"/>
How shall the body of the <hi>Cannibal</hi> that eat them be raised, when according to this account it be must deprived of one half of the substance it died withal? I answer, that to this remaining half of his bodily substance there may, without any repugnance to its being raised the <hi>same body,</hi> be added out of the <hi>common mass</hi> of matter as much new bodily substance as is sufficient to red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>integrate it in all its parts; for the resurrection of the <hi>same body,</hi> doth not necessarily imply that all the <hi>same matter</hi> shall be raised, and no <hi>other,</hi> and no <hi>more.</hi> For if all shall be raised in the most <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> stature and proportion of humane bodies, as there is no doubt but they shall, then Infants and Dwarfs, and such as die of Consumptions must have <hi>new matter</hi> added to that which they die withal; and therefore the resurrection of the <hi>same body</hi> can imply no more than this, that every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy shall be raised out of the <hi>same matter,</hi> so far as it will go; and therefore if this remaining half of the substance of the <hi>Canibals</hi> body will not go far enough to redintegrate his <hi>whole</hi> body at the resurrection, there is no doubt but God will add <hi>new substance</hi> to it, which will no more hinder it from being the <hi>same numerical</hi> Body, than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of an house <hi>with new stones</hi> and <hi>Timber</hi> hinders it from being the <hi>same numerical</hi> house. For suppose that God by a Miracle should in an instant restore a man to his <hi>full Bulk,</hi> the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of whose body is half pined away by a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring <hi>Consumption,</hi> this would not at all hinder but that still it would be the <hi>same numerical</hi> Body. Why then should the Addition of <hi>new</hi> bodily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to the remaining half of the matter of the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:58668:262"/>
                  <hi>Canibals</hi> body at the resurrection, hinder it from being raised <hi>numerically</hi> the <hi>same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I conceive is sufficient to clear the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the general Resurrection from all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Repugnancy</hi> and <hi>Contradiction.</hi> But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose after all that there should be some <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>singular</hi> instances wherein it will be <hi>impossible</hi> in the nature of the thing for the <hi>same numerical</hi> Body to be raised again; this would no more impeach the truth of a general resurrection of the same bodies; than <hi>Enoch</hi>'s and <hi>Elias</hi>'s not dying, do the truth of the Maxim of the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, It is appointed for all men once to die.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in any instance it should be <hi>impossible</hi> in the nature of the thing for God to raise the <hi>same</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it will be sufficient to serve the purpose of <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>punishments,</hi> for God to cloath the <hi>same soul</hi> in a <hi>new body.</hi> For it is the <hi>soul</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuates the man, and makes him to be the <hi>same person</hi> though he hath not the <hi>same body.</hi> We have not the same <hi>matter</hi> about us when we are ten years old, that we were first cloathed with when we were born, and as he who shall be rewarded or punished <hi>ten years</hi> hence for a Vertue or a Crime which he acts <hi>now</hi> will be rewarded or punished in the <hi>same body,</hi> though <hi>not</hi> in the <hi>same matter</hi>; so he who shall be rewarded or punished at the resurrection for the good or evil which he doth in this life, will be rewarded or punished in the <hi>same person,</hi> though it should not be in the <hi>same body.</hi> But it being more congruous to the <hi>accuracy</hi> and <hi>exactness</hi> of the divine justice that it should be in the <hi>same body</hi> as well as in the <hi>same person,</hi> and it being every whit as <hi>easie</hi> to an <hi>infinite power</hi> to
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:58668:263"/>
restore to our souls the <hi>same bodies</hi> as to cloath them in <hi>new</hi> ones (for within the compass of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssibilities all things are <hi>equally</hi> within the reach of Omnipotence) mens bodies shall be universally rebuilt at the Resurrection out of those <hi>old Ruins</hi> and <hi>Materials,</hi> in which they did good or evil in this life; and if there should happen some <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> instances wherein such a numerical resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection should be in it self <hi>impossible,</hi> these will be only a few exceptions from that general rule, which rather confirm than destroy it. For thus from Scripture we are assured that they who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. and that <hi>all that are in the grave shall hear Christs voice and come forth.</hi> John 5.28, 29. that <hi>the Sea shall give up the dead which are in it, and that death and Hell,</hi> i. e. the grave <hi>shall deliver up the dead which are in them,</hi> Rev. 20.13. All which expressions according to the literal sense of them (from which without necessary reasons we ought not to depart) do plainly import a resurrection of the <hi>same numerical bodies.</hi> Our Resurrection therefore being a <hi>possible</hi> thing, is as <hi>easie</hi> to an <hi>omnipotent</hi> Power, as <hi>Christ</hi>'s was, and therefore <hi>his</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection is a most certain pledge of <hi>ours</hi>; since he rose as our common <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,</hi> and consequently rose with the very same <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to raise <hi>us</hi> which he had to raise <hi>himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus proved the Truth of the <hi>matter</hi> of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ will raise us at the last day; I proceed in the next place to the <hi>manner</hi> of the Fact, how it is that he will raise us. In treating of which, I shall regulate my self by that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:58668:263"/>
which the Apostle gives of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. in which he having proved at large the truth of the Resurrection from <hi>ver.</hi> 12. to the 35th. he comes to answer an Objection concerning the manner of it; <hi>but some man will say, how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come?</hi> In answer to which he gives a large description of it, and by the similitude of <hi>seed,</hi> explicates the <hi>manner</hi> how it shall be performed, till he comes to <hi>ver.</hi> 42. where he applies the similitude to the matter in hand; <hi>so also is the Resurrection of the Dead</hi>; and then goes on with a farther enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on it to the end of the Chapter. So that this <hi>so also</hi> refers both to what went before, and to what follows. <hi>So also,</hi> i. e. so as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in part <hi>described</hi> and shall farther explain in my ensuing Discourse; This <hi>so</hi> therefore refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the <hi>whole description,</hi> implies these five par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of which the whole consists.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>So</hi> is this mortal body to be the <hi>seed</hi> and <hi>material Principle</hi> of our Resurrection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>So</hi> must this Seed <hi>die</hi> and be <hi>corrupted,</hi> before it be quickned and revived.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>So</hi> is this dead corrupted body to be <hi>raised</hi> and <hi>quickned</hi> by the power of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>So</hi> is it to be <hi>raised</hi> by the Divine Power into the proper and natural form of an humane body.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>So</hi> is this humane body to be <hi>changed</hi> and <hi>altered</hi> in its Resurrection.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>So is the Resurrection of the dead,</hi> i. e. so is this mortal body to be the <hi>seed</hi> and <hi>material prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
                  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:58668:264"/>
of the Resurrection. For this is plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. <hi>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickned except it die.</hi> Intimating, that as the <hi>Seed</hi> is the <hi>material cause</hi> of the Ear of Corn which afterwards springs up, <hi>so</hi> are these <hi>mortal bodies</hi> which we sow in the Earth, at least the main <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials</hi> of those immortal ones into which we shall be quickned at the Resurrection. Perhaps as the Seed <hi>digests</hi> and <hi>incorporates</hi> into it self the <hi>juyces</hi> of the Earth, and shoots them up <hi>together</hi> with its own substance into the Stalk and Ear; so in some particular instances at least, there may be other <hi>matter</hi> at our Resurrection <hi>interwoven</hi> with the appropriate substance of our mortal bodies, and <hi>together</hi> with it spring up into <hi>immortal</hi> ones. Yet from the Apostles comparison it is apparent that <hi>this</hi> very mortal body which we sow in the Grave shall be at least the <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>Embryo</hi> which shall receive our Soul at the Resurrection, and by that (supposing <hi>other matter</hi> be added to it) <hi>assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate</hi> and <hi>digest</hi> it into its own substance. Now though to <hi>reproduce</hi> the scattered particles of our dissolved flesh, and <hi>extricate</hi> them out of all those other substances whereinto they have been woven and entangled, may seem to us at first view an <hi>impossible performance</hi>; yet that it is not <hi>so,</hi> I have already demonstrated; and if a parcel of <hi>Quicksilver</hi> after it hath run a tedious course of <hi>alteration,</hi> shifted it self out of its <hi>natural form</hi> into that of a <hi>vapour,</hi> out of a <hi>vapour</hi> into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid <hi>water,</hi> out of <hi>water</hi> into a white or red or yellow <hi>powder,</hi> out of that into a <hi>salt,</hi> and thence into a malleable <hi>Metal,</hi> may by a skilful Artist be reduced out of all these various contextures
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:58668:264"/>
into its <hi>natural form</hi> of plain and running <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> why should we think it either <hi>impossible</hi> or <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult</hi> for a Being of <hi>immense knowledge</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to watch the wandering particles of our corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bodies through all their successive <hi>alterations,</hi> and to <hi>retrieve</hi> them out of all those substances into which they shall be finally resolved; to take out of one body what belongs to another, and restore to each its own; and finally to <hi>incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> them all together into their <hi>natural forms</hi> and <hi>figures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>So</hi> is the Resurrection of the dead, <hi>i. e. so</hi> is this Seed of our mortal body to <hi>die</hi> and be <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,</hi> before it shall be raised again. <hi>That which thou sowest is not quickened unless it die</hi>; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, that as the <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> are <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> in the ground, and <hi>dissolved</hi> into a liquid Jelly before it springs up into a <hi>Stalk</hi> and <hi>Ear</hi>; so this mortal <hi>body</hi> of ours must be <hi>corrupted,</hi> its parts must be <hi>dispersed</hi> and <hi>dissipated</hi> from one another, before it quickens and springs up again at the general <hi>Resurrection</hi>; and indeed the body must <hi>naturally corrupt,</hi> when once it is <hi>separated</hi> from the Soul that enlivens it; and that before it is rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and glorified the <hi>Soul</hi> should remain for some space <hi>separated</hi> from it, seems highly necessary. For the nature of <hi>Souls</hi> is such as requires a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual and leisurely <hi>progression</hi> out of one state into another; their faculties are such as cannot in a natural way be improved but by <hi>degrees,</hi> or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in an instant for two <hi>extream conditions,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a miracle. But as for this <hi>mortal</hi> State and that of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> they are two such remote and distant <hi>extreams,</hi> as that <hi>our</hi> slow paced <hi>natures</hi>
                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:58668:265"/>
cannot travel from one to the other under a long space of <hi>time</hi>; and for a Soul to pass in one instant out of an <hi>Earthly</hi> into an <hi>Heavenly,</hi> out of a <hi>fleshly</hi> into a <hi>spiritual,</hi> out of a <hi>mortal</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an <hi>immortal</hi> body, seems too <hi>great</hi> a leap for a Being whose nature confines it to a <hi>gradual</hi> improvement. For how should a <hi>Soul</hi> which hath been so long immured in mortal <hi>flesh,</hi> so long accustomed to its <hi>sensual</hi> pleasures, so clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and incumbered with its unwieldly <hi>organs,</hi> so pinioned and hampered by its brutish <hi>appetites</hi>; How, I say, is it possible in a <hi>natural</hi> way for <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Soul</hi> to be immediately disposed to act and animate an <hi>Heavenly Body?</hi> And therefore it is requisite that for <hi>some</hi> time at least it should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in a <hi>separate</hi> state, there to inure it self to a <hi>heavenly life,</hi> and by a continued contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and love, and imitation of God to ripen <hi>gradually</hi> into the state of the Resurrection, and to contract a perfect <hi>aptitude</hi> to animate an <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly body,</hi> that so its powers being <hi>enlarged</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> by exercise, it may be able to manage that <hi>active</hi> fiery Chariot, and be prepared to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate by its <hi>nimble</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Organs, which till the Soul is rendered more sprightly and active by long and continual <hi>exercise,</hi> will be perhaps two swift for it to keep pace withal.

the beggarly vestment of their <hi>flesh,</hi> while it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, shall in an <hi>instant</hi> be <hi>transformed</hi> into a glorious and immortal Robe; which to be sure it would not be, unless in the same instant also their <hi>Souls</hi> were made <hi>fit</hi> to wear it. But then it is to be considered that both will be <hi>miraculous</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And, for ought I know, it will be as great a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle immediately to fit an <hi>imperfect Soul</hi> for a <hi>glorified body,</hi> as immediately to change a <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>corruptible</hi> body into a <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>immortal</hi> one. And therefore though some Souls shall be <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> qualified to operate by glorified bodies, without any intermediate space of <hi>separation</hi>; yet this being <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>miraculous,</hi> is only an <hi>exception</hi> from the general rule of <hi>Providence,</hi> which is to leave things to proceed and act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>regular</hi> course of their <hi>Natures</hi>; and if Souls are so left, as ordinarily to be sure they are, it is highly requisite that they should be allowed some <hi>space</hi> of <hi>separation</hi> from their <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> bodies before they are cloathed with their <hi>immortal</hi> ones; and consequently, that this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal body should be <hi>corrupted</hi> and <hi>dissolved</hi> before it is <hi>quickened</hi> and <hi>glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>So is the Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> that is, so is this dead corrupted body to be raised and quickned by the power of God; so Ver. 37, 38. <hi>That which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, perhaps of Wheat, or of some other grain, but God giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it a body as it pleaseth him</hi>; in which he plainly intimates, that as a <hi>grain</hi> of Wheat sown in the ground is only the <hi>Seed</hi> or <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Principle</hi> of the <hi>Stalk</hi> and <hi>Ear</hi> that spring
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:58668:266"/>
up from it, but <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>principal efficient</hi> cause that forms the matter, and enlivens it, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it to spring up and ripen; so though these <hi>mortal</hi> bodies which we sow in the Grave are the <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>matter</hi> out of which our <hi>immortal</hi> one shall spring, yet it is <hi>God</hi> that must <hi>recollect</hi> this matter, <hi>reduce</hi> it into a body again, and <hi>reunite</hi> it to its ancient Soul. For this is such a performance as doth require an <hi>Almighty</hi> Agent; it is <hi>he alone</hi> can trace our scattered Atoms through all those Generations and Corruptions wherein they have wandered, and <hi>retrieve</hi> them out of all those other bodies whereinto they have been finally resolved. It is <hi>he alone</hi> can <hi>separate</hi> them into the several Masses whereunto they originally appertained, and <hi>order, distinguish,</hi> and <hi>distribute</hi> those rude Masses into their various parts, and connect and joyn one part to another. It is he alone that can <hi>reorganize</hi> those undistinguished heaps into humane bodies, and <hi>reunite</hi> them to their Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Souls. And accordingly we find that this great Article of the Resurrection is in Scripture resolved into the power of God: for so our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour attributes the Sadduces denial of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection to their <hi>not knowing the Scripture and the power of God,</hi> Mat. 22.29. which plainly implies, that the power of God must be the cause of the Resurrection. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that he was brought into a great extremity, that so <hi>he might not trust in himself, but in God that raiseth up the dead</hi>; and 1 Tim. 6.13. <hi>I charge thee,</hi> saith he, <hi>before God that quickeneth all things.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to <hi>quicken</hi> our bodies when they are dead, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the same power as it did at first to <hi>create</hi>
                  <pb n="507" facs="tcp:58668:266"/>
and <hi>form</hi> them. For as at their first <hi>Creation</hi> they were formed out of the <hi>pre-existing</hi> matter of the Earth, so at the <hi>Resurrection</hi> they must be <hi>repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced</hi> out of the same matter again; and as at the <hi>Creation</hi> all those distinct kinds of Beings we behold lay <hi>shuffled</hi> together in one common Mass, till the fruitful voice of <hi>God</hi> separated this united Multitude into their distinct Species; so at the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> after these mortal bodies are crumbled into dust, and that dust is scattered through all that confused Mass again, it is <hi>God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi> whose powerful voice can command them <hi>back again</hi> in their proper shapes, and call them out again by their single individuals: so that as our first existence was only a real Eccho to Gods omnipotent <hi>Fiat,</hi> so will our return into existence be to his Almighty <hi>Surge.</hi> The Scripture indeed seems to affirm, that the holy <hi>Angels</hi> will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this great transaction, though what they are to do in it is not expresly related; only 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.16. the Apostle seems to intimate that their Office will be to collect the scattered relicks of our mortality; for there he tells us, that <hi>the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and the Trump of God,</hi> upon which <hi>the dead in Christ shall rise first.</hi> Which popular description seems to import, that as by a loud <hi>voice</hi> or a <hi>Trumpet</hi> it was anciently the custom of the Jews, and other Nations, to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Assemblies,</hi> and particularly by a <hi>Trumpet</hi> to collect and rally their <hi>Armies</hi>; so at the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> our Saviour by the Ministry of his <hi>Angels,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of their <hi>Archangel,</hi> will assemble and rally our scattered Atoms, and then by his
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:58668:267"/>
divine power Organize them into humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies again, and reunite them to their proper Souls. For so <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. Christ tells us, that his Angels shall with the <hi>sound of the Trumpet gather together his Elect from the four Winds.</hi> Which if you compare with the above-cited Text, you will find that this sound of the <hi>Trumpet</hi> by which the Elect are to be gathered is to <hi>precede</hi> their Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and consequently, that it is not to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them when they <hi>are</hi> raised, but to gather them <hi>to be</hi> raised; that is, to collect their dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dust which hath been blown about upon the Wings of the Wind, in order to their being <hi>red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>integrated</hi> into humane bodies, and <hi>reinformed</hi> with their Primitive Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>So is the Resurrection of the dead, i. e.</hi> so are our dead bodies to be raised again into the proper form and kind of humane bodies; and this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in <hi>ver.</hi> 38. <hi>but God giveth it a body as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him, and unto every Seed his own body, i. e.</hi> as to the seed of Wheat which dies in the <hi>Winter,</hi> God gives in the <hi>Spring</hi> the Body, or Stalk, and Ear of Wheat; so to this mortal body which we sow in the <hi>Grave,</hi> God will give at the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> its own proper and specifick form. For the Soul will have the same faculties at the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that it hath now in this mortal state, and the <hi>Body</hi> is only in order to the <hi>Soul,</hi> its parts and members being all purposely contrived into fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments for the Soul to work withal. These inward <hi>faculties</hi> therefore continuing still and for ever the <hi>same,</hi> it is highly requisite that at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection they should be <hi>refitted</hi> with the same corporeal instruments of action: for the Soul is
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:58668:267"/>
to the Body what the <hi>art</hi> is to the <hi>thing</hi> that is formed by the Art; and therefore as the <hi>thing</hi> formed is not perfect so long as it is any way dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable to the Art which formed it; so neither can the <hi>Body</hi> be perfect till in all its parts it is every way apportioned unto the faculties of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and how can the matter of this corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body be <hi>readapted</hi> to the natural faculties of a humane Soul, unless it be raised again into an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, and restored to its <hi>Primitive</hi> figure and proportion? For should it be raised with <hi>more</hi> or <hi>fewer</hi> parts than those it now consists of, it must either be <hi>defective</hi> or <hi>superfluous</hi> in its parts, or the Soul must have more or fewer faculties to employ them. It is true, after the <hi>Resurrection</hi> the Scripture plainly tells us, that our Souls shall no longer exercise those their <hi>Animal faculties</hi> of nourishing and propagation; that <hi>the Sons of the Resurrection shall neither marry, nor be given in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but that they shall be equal to the Angels of God,</hi> Mat. 22.30. and indeed since every individual man will then be raised into an <hi>immortal state,</hi> there will be no need either that they should be <hi>nourished</hi> themselves, or that they should <hi>propagate</hi> any more individuals to preserve their kind. But it doth not hence follow, either that the <hi>Soul</hi> shall be deprived of those <hi>Animal faculties,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that the <hi>Body</hi> shall be raised without the <hi>Organs</hi> by which those <hi>Animal operations</hi> are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: for though our Saviours Body after the <hi>Resurrection</hi> had no need of <hi>nourishment,</hi> yet it is plain it was raised again with its natural <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of eating and drinking, which he once actually used to assure his Disciples of the <hi>reality</hi>
                  <pb n="510" facs="tcp:58668:268"/>
of his Resurrection; and though now those parts are useless to him, as to that <hi>particular</hi> animal operation, yet there is no doubt but his <hi>Soul</hi> still uses them for other <hi>unknown</hi> purposes peculiar to his glorified state; or if he do not, yet since those parts were necessary to the <hi>perfection</hi> of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, and consequently, to the <hi>redintegrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of his humane nature, it was requisite he should be raised with them, that so he might have <hi>corporeal</hi> Organs adapted to his <hi>animal</hi> faculties, which it is plain were not <hi>extinguished</hi> by his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>; and since the Resurrection of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours</hi> body is in Scripture represented as the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of <hi>ours</hi> (for he shall change our <hi>vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body,</hi> Philip. 3. Vers. 21.) we may hence warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conclude that <hi>ours</hi> shall be raised as <hi>his</hi> was, <hi>compleat</hi> in all the parts of an humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p n="5">V. And lastly, <hi>So is the resurrection of the dead,</hi> i. e. so are these humane bodies to be changed and altered by the resurrection. So <hi>ver.</hi> 37. <hi>That which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain</hi>; intimating, that as the seed when it is sown is nothing but <hi>bare seed,</hi> though when it is quickened it springs up into a long <hi>stalk</hi> and <hi>ear,</hi> which many times contains in it an hundred grains; even so this mortal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is only the <hi>naked seed</hi> of our Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, shall be very much altered from what it is, and changed into a more <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> substance. For the more clear and distinct ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of which, we will <hi>first</hi> consider the Change that will then be made in the bodies of

                  <hi>good</hi> men; and <hi>secondly,</hi> the change that will be made in the bodies of the <hi>wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, We will consider the Change that will then be made in the bodies of <hi>good</hi> men; which consists of four particulars.</p>
               <p>First, They will be changed from <hi>base</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> into <hi>glorious</hi> Bodies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From <hi>earthly</hi> and <hi>fleshly</hi> into <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> Bodies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>passive</hi> into <hi>active</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> Bodies.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, From <hi>mortal</hi> and <hi>corruptible</hi> into <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal</hi> and <hi>incorruptible</hi> Bodies.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Bodies of <hi>good</hi> Men will be changed from <hi>base</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> into <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> ones; so <hi>ver.</hi> 43. <hi>It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory,</hi> that is, when it is sown in the grave, it is a <hi>base</hi> and <hi>abject</hi> thing, not to be indured above ground for its gastly looks, and nauseous stink and putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but at its resurrection it shall come forth in a <hi>bright,</hi> and <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>venerable</hi> form; for so our Saviour assures us, that after their resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <hi>the righteous shall shine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father,</hi> Mat. 13.43. that is, the matter of their bodies shall be <hi>refined</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted</hi> into a bright and lucid substance, which shall glitter like the Sun and cast forth rays of glory round about them; and this perhaps is <hi>that inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> that is, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied in light, which the Apostle speaks of <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. for when this dull matter comes to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated</hi> with a blessed and glorified Soul, it will doubtless derive from it a great deal of <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>lustre.</hi> For if <hi>now</hi> our Soul when it is overjoyed

can so transfigure our Bodies, fill our <hi>eyes</hi> with such sprightly flames, overspread our <hi>countenances</hi> with such an amiable air, and paint our <hi>faces</hi> with such a serene and florid aspect, what a change will it make in our <hi>Resurrection-body,</hi> which being incomparably more fine and subtil than <hi>this,</hi> will be far more pliable to the motions of the Soul? When therefore the happy Soul shall re-enter this <hi>softned</hi> and <hi>liquified</hi> matter, ravished with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable joy and content; how will its delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som emotions change and transfigure it, how will its active joys shine through and overspread it with an amiable Glory? especially when with this <hi>natural</hi> energy of its glorified Soul, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himself shall cooperate to <hi>change this vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.</hi> Though now therefore the matter of our bodies is <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,</hi> and such as seems altogether incapable of such a <hi>glorious change</hi>; yet according to the best Philosophy there is no <hi>specifick</hi> difference in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and if the vilest and most ignoble matter may by mere <hi>motion,</hi> not only be Crystallized but transformed into a flaming brightness, as we are sure it may; if in lighting of a <hi>Candle</hi> that is newly blown out, by applying another to the ascending smoke, this <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>stinking</hi> substance may in the twinkling of an eye be changed into a <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> flame, into what a <hi>refulgent</hi> substance may the matter of this <hi>mortal body</hi> be changed by the concurrence of an <hi>infinite power</hi> with the vigorous <hi>activity</hi> of a glorified Soul?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="513" facs="tcp:58668:269"/>II. The Bodies of good Men will be changed from <hi>earthly</hi> and <hi>fleshly</hi> into <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> So <hi>ver.</hi> 44. <hi>It is sown,</hi> saith he, <hi>a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body,</hi> where those words <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>mind,</hi> but the <hi>mind</hi> will govern, and the <hi>body</hi> obey without any contest or reluctancy; and as the <hi>body</hi> will be wholly <hi>obedient</hi> to the mind, so it will be perfectly <hi>adapted</hi> to its service; for whereas now by reason of its gross consistency, it is an unwieldy <hi>Luggage</hi> to the <hi>Soul,</hi> and doth very much <hi>clog</hi> and <hi>incumber</hi> her in her opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; it will then be wrought into so fine and tenuious a substance, as that instead of a <hi>clog</hi> it will be a <hi>wing</hi> to the Soul: for its consistence will be subtil as the finest <hi>Aether,</hi> and active as the purest <hi>flame</hi>; it will have nothing that is gross or burdensom in it to <hi>retard</hi> or <hi>weary</hi> it in its flights, to <hi>rebate</hi> its vigour or <hi>slacken</hi> its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it will be all <hi>life</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>wing,</hi> and like a perpetual motion be carried on with <hi>unwearied swiftness</hi> by its own internal springs, and being freed from all that <hi>weight</hi> which now renders it so slow and heavy, it will be able to move like a <hi>thought,</hi> and to keep pace with the most nimble <hi>wishes</hi> of the Soul; so that what <hi>Hierocles</hi> saith of his spiritual Body, <gap reason="foreign">

Since therefore at the Resurrection God will fit and adapt our <hi>bodies</hi> to the utmost activity of our <hi>glorified spirits,</hi> they must necessarily be supposed to be endued with unspeakable <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>agility,</hi> upon which account they are called by the ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, <hi>Eagles wings,</hi> upon which they suppose our <hi>glorified Souls</hi> shall be able to fly as fast

and as far as they please, and this I am apt to think is intimated in that passage of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Thes. 4.17. <hi>And they that are alive,</hi> and whose bodies are changed in the state of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <hi>shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air,</hi> the meaning of which is, not that they shall be snatched up from the Earth by any <hi>external</hi> cause of <hi>Agent,</hi> but that their Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing changed into pure aetherial flame, they shall of their <hi>own accords</hi> ascend in them as in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fiery Chariots to the Throne of their Redeemer in the Clouds: and from thence when the <hi>judgment</hi> is concluded, shall as nimbly ascend with him through all those spacious Fields of Air and Aether, that lie between that and the eternal Paradise of Blessedness.

                  </gap>, and therefore shall not <hi>need</hi> their help in this <hi>angelified</hi> state, either to waft them up into the Air, or from thence into the Heaven of Heavens; and if by their <hi>own activity</hi> they shall be able to perform so vast a flight as 'tis from the <hi>earth</hi> into the uppermost Region of the <hi>Air,</hi> and from thence into the <hi>supreme Region</hi> of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting glory, we may from thence collect what a vast power they will be endued with at their <hi>Resurrection.</hi> But this is most certain that then they shall be perfectly released from all dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>passion,</hi> and continue in perfect <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>health</hi> and <hi>vigour</hi> for ever. So that whereas now our Bodies are exceeding <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>passive,</hi> a kind of walking Hospitals of pains, infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:58668:271"/>
and diseases; the time will come when our <hi>soul</hi> shall be accommodated with a much more <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>convenient,</hi> as well as <hi>glorious habitation,</hi> wherein it shall for ever forget those dismal Cries, O my Head, my Heart, my Bowels, and enjoy everlasting <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>freedom.</hi> Now she is in a <hi>travelling</hi> condition, and the <hi>Inn</hi> she lodges at is <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>inconvenient,</hi> her Provision is course, her Bed hard, and her Rest continually interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with noise and tumult, but when she is once got home to her own House, her <hi>house not made with hands eternal in the Heavens</hi> she shall there live in perfect <hi>ease and pleasure,</hi> free from all the annoyances of flesh and blood, from all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances of pain and sickness, and from all the toil and fatigue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the noise and hurry of this mortal condition, and with splendid <hi>State,</hi> delicious <hi>fare,</hi> soft and quiet <hi>repose</hi> recompence her self a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand fold for all her present <hi>travel</hi> and <hi>weariness.</hi>

               <p n="4">IV. And lastly, The Bodies of <hi>good</hi> men will be changed from <hi>corruptible</hi> and <hi>mortal</hi> into <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible</hi> and <hi>immortal.</hi> So <hi>ver.</hi> 42.53. <hi>it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption, and this corruptible must put on incorruption, this mortal must put on immortality,</hi> i. e.

merely <hi>varnished</hi> and <hi>gilded</hi> over with an <hi>external</hi> glory and beauty, but that all <hi>inward</hi> principles of corruption shall be utterly <hi>purged</hi> out of its <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> so that it shall not be preserved immortal merely by the force of an <hi>external</hi> cause, but be so far immortal in it <hi>self,</hi> as not to have any tendency to death in its <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>constitution:</hi> For either it will be so <hi>liquid,</hi> that should its parts be separated by any external violence, like the divided Aether they will immediately close again, or else so <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>compact</hi> that no external vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence will be able to divide them; and thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no <hi>alloy</hi> of corrupt principles in its <hi>nature,</hi> no quarrels or discords between <hi>contrary qualities,</hi> and being perpetually acted by a most <hi>happy, sprightly</hi> and <hi>vivacious soul,</hi> which will every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diffuse a vast plenty of life and vigour throughout all its parts, it will be also secure from all <hi>inward</hi> tendencies to <hi>mortality,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus fortified both <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without</hi> against all attempts towards a <hi>dissolution,</hi> what should hinder it from living for ever and flourishing in <hi>immortal youth?</hi> And thus I have endeavoured to give an account of the happy Changes which <hi>good</hi> mens Bodies will undergo in the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
               <p>But though they shall all of them be raised with unspeakable <hi>advantages</hi> and <hi>improvements,</hi> yet it is apparent from this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. that they shall vastly <hi>differ</hi> in the degrees of their glory; so <hi>ver.</hi> 41. <hi>There is one glory of the Sun, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glory of the Moon, and another glory of the stars, for one star differeth from another star in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, so also is the resurrection of the dead,</hi> i. e. As
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:58668:272"/>
the Sun is more glorious than the Moon, the Moon than the stars, and one star than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so shall our bodies at the Resurrection be arrayed with <hi>different</hi> degrees of glory; and doubtless these <hi>differences</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> in our raised bodies will arise from those <hi>different</hi> degrees of <hi>perfection</hi> to which their respective Souls have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; for the more <hi>perfect</hi> those <hi>souls</hi> are, the more <hi>improved</hi> and <hi>accomplished bodies</hi> they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, because according as they rise in <hi>degrees</hi> of perfection, their powers will be enlarged and their faculties rendered more active, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently will require bodies more active and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful. And therefore since at the Resurrection God will <hi>accommodate</hi> every <hi>soul</hi> with a <hi>body</hi> suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it in its <hi>utmost</hi> exaltations and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we may reasonably conclude that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral bodies that are raised shall be more or less <hi>glorious,</hi> as the several souls to which they apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain are more or less advanced in <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> For the <hi>fitness</hi> and <hi>congruity</hi> of souls to glorified bodies consists in their <hi>moral perfection</hi>; and if upon an impossible supposition, a <hi>wicked soul</hi> should be mistaken for a <hi>pious</hi> one and thrust into a <hi>glorified body,</hi> it would not know what to do with, or how to behave it self in it, but like a <hi>Swine</hi> in a Palace would soon be weary of its habitation and impatiently long to be restored to its beloved <hi>stye</hi> and <hi>mire.</hi> For a glorified <hi>body</hi> is an Instrument proper only for a glorified <hi>soul</hi> to act and work with; It is purposely <hi>framed</hi> and <hi>composed</hi> for contemplation and love for joy and praise and Adoration, and, what should a <hi>vicious soul</hi> do with such a body to whom those
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:58668:273"/>
heavenly exercises it was designed for are unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural? 'Tis <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> that fits and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a Soul to animate and act in a <hi>glorified body</hi>; and therefore I am apt to think, that as the <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal disposition</hi> of our <hi>soul</hi> doth now co-operate with the divine Providence in the <hi>forming</hi> its <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> body in the <hi>womb,</hi> so that <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual disposition</hi> which the Soul doth contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and improve after its separation from the body will co-operate with the Almighty Power of our Saviour in the <hi>forming</hi> its <hi>new</hi> body at the <hi>Resurrection</hi>; and that as by the Animal Plastick power of our <hi>souls,</hi> God did first form our Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <hi>bodies,</hi> so by this spiritual Plastick power of it which is nothing but its <hi>moral perfection,</hi> he will hereafter form our <hi>spiritual bodies</hi>; and if so, then the more of that <hi>perfection</hi> the Soul arrives to at the Resurrection, the more it will <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize</hi> and <hi>glorifie</hi> its body; and so still the more <hi>perfect</hi> it grows, the more it will improve its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified body in <hi>beauty, lustre</hi> and <hi>activity,</hi> so that as through a transparent <hi>Glass</hi> we plainly discern the size and colour of the <hi>substance</hi> contained in it, so perhaps through the still encreasing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the <hi>bodies glory,</hi> the degree and size of the <hi>Souls perfection</hi> will appear. But whether this be true or no, which I confess is only my <hi>conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> thus much is certain, that the bodies of men will be raised with different <hi>degrees</hi> of glory; and therefore since we are assured that the great <hi>end</hi> of the last judgment will be to distribute to every one according to his Works, we have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reason to conclude that the <hi>bodies</hi> will be glorified more or less in <hi>proportion</hi> to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their <hi>Souls.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="521" facs="tcp:58668:273"/>And thus I have endeavoured to give a brief account of those happy changes which <hi>good</hi> mens bodies must undergo at the <hi>Resurrection</hi>; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed therefore in the next place to shew the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful change that will then also be made in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of <hi>wicked</hi> men: In which I shall be very brief, because we have but a very short and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral account of it in Scripture, where we are only told that they shall <hi>awake to everlasting shame and contempt,</hi> Dan. 12.2. and that they <hi>shall come forth to the Resurrection of Damnation,</hi> John 5.28. and that upon their Resurrection they shall <hi>be judged according to their works,</hi> and <hi>cast into the Lake of fire,</hi> Rev. 20.13.15. from whence it is apparent that they shall be raised for no other <hi>end,</hi> but to be <hi>punished,</hi> to endure that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which shall then be rendered to them, even the vengeance of <hi>eternal fire</hi>; for that will be their doom, <hi>Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Since therefore their Resurrection will be only in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their being fetched from <hi>Prison</hi> to <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and sent from <hi>Iudgment</hi> to <hi>Execution</hi>; to be sure their bodies will be raised in full <hi>capacity</hi> to suffer the fearful execution of their doom; that is, with an exquisite <hi>sense</hi> to feel, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible <hi>strength</hi> to sustain the torment of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fire. For since they must suffer for ever, they must be raised both <hi>passive</hi> and <hi>immortal,</hi> with a <hi>sense</hi> as <hi>quick</hi> as lightening to perceive their misery, and yet as durable as Anvil to undergo the stroaks of it, which to all <hi>eternity</hi> will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated upon them without any pause or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. Thus shall they be raised with a most

                  <hi>vivacious</hi> and <hi>everlasting sense</hi> of pain, that so they may ever feel the pangs of death without ever dying; so St. <hi>Cyril Catech. illum.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 26. <gap reason="foreign">

And this is all the account we have from Scripture concerning the change that shall be made by the Resurrection in the bodies of <hi>wicked</hi> men, <hi>viz.</hi> that from <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>corruptible</hi> bodies they shall be changed into <hi>vigorous</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible</hi> ones, and be endued with a quick and everlasting <hi>sense</hi> of all that everlasting <hi>punishment</hi> which they are raised to endure.</p>
               <p>Thus having given an account at large of this <hi>second Regal Act</hi> which our blessed Saviour is <hi>yet</hi> to perform, <hi>viz. Raising</hi> the <hi>dead,</hi> I proceed to the</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="523" facs="tcp:58668:274"/>III. And last, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>judging the World.</hi> In treating of which great and fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of our Faith, I shall endeavour</p>
               <p>First, To prove the <hi>truth</hi> of the thing that our blessed Saviour <hi>shall</hi> judge the World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To give an account of the <hi>signs</hi> and <hi>forerunners</hi> of his coming to judge it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To shew the <hi>manner</hi> of his coming.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To explain the whole <hi>process</hi> of his <hi>judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. I shall endeavour to prove the <hi>truth</hi> of the thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that our Saviour <hi>shall</hi> judge the World, than which there is no one Proposition more frequently and plainly asserted in holy Scripture. Thus <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. we are told, that <hi>God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day in which he will judge the World in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained,</hi> and that this man is Jesus Christ we are assured, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42. <hi>And he commanded us to preach unto the People, and to testifie that it is he which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God to be the Iudge of quick and dead</hi>; So also 2 Tim. 4.1. <hi>I charge thee before God and the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdom.</hi> And accordingly we are told, that <hi>we shall all stand before the Iudgment seat of Christ,</hi> Rom. 14.10. <hi>And all appear before the Iudgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10. And to the same purpose our Saviour himself tells us, that <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judgeth no man,</hi> that is immediately, <hi>but hath given all judgment to his Son</hi>; and afterward he gives the reason of it, <hi>because he is the Son of
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:58668:275"/>
man, Iohn</hi> 5.22.27. that is, because he dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complied with his Fathers Will in chearfully condescending to cloath himself in Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therein to offer up himself a willing Victim for the sins of the World; for so <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9.12. <hi>Worthy is he alone to receive the Book,</hi> (of judgment) <hi>and to open the Seals thereof, because he was slain, and hath redeemed us to God by his blood, worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive the power and honour, the glory and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> appendent to his high Office of judging the World. From all which it abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that this great action of judging the World is to be performed by <hi>Christ.</hi> I proceed therefore to the</p>
               <p>Second general Head I proposed to treat of, which was to give an account of the <hi>signs</hi> and <hi>forerunners</hi> of his coming to <hi>judgment.</hi> For before he actually appears he will give the secure World a fearful warning of his coming by hanging out to its publick view a great many horrible signs and spectacles, for thus the Prophet <hi>Ioel, Ioel</hi> 1.30, 31. <hi>I will shew wonders in the Heavens, and in the Earth blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke, the Sun shall be turned into darkness, and the Moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord,</hi> which Prophesie of his is particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified by our Saviour, <hi>Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened, and the Moon shall not give her light, and the Stars of Heaven shall fall, and the Powers of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens shall be shaken, and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven,</hi> Matt. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 29, 30. and more particularly, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.11.25. <hi>Great
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:58668:275"/>
Earthquakes shall be in divers places, and Famines, and Pestilences, and fearful sights, and great signs shall there be from Heaven, and there shall be signs in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars, and upon the Earth distress of Nations with great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, the Sea and the Waves roaring,</hi> and then it follows, <hi>then shall they see the Son of man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> It is true, this Prophesie of our Saviour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately respects the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and was in part <hi>accomplished</hi> in it; several of <hi>these</hi> very <hi>signs</hi> being a little before the Calamity of that City <hi>actually</hi> exhibited to the publick view of the World, as both <hi>Iosephus</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us; and several others of them were exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited <hi>immediately after the Tribulation of those days</hi> in that prodigious irruption of <hi>Vesuvius</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania,</hi> the woful effects whereof were felt not only in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> but in a great part of <hi>Africa,</hi> in <hi>Syria, Constantinople,</hi> and in all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Countries, <hi>Vid. Dion. Cass. lib.</hi> 66.68. but it is apparent that our Saviour here prophesies of the Judgment of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as it was a <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Representation</hi> of the <hi>general</hi> Judgment; so that though his Prophesie respects <hi>Ierusalems</hi> doom <hi>immediately,</hi> yet through this it looks forward to the final Doom of the World, and therefore as in foretelling the <hi>former</hi> he prefigures the <hi>later,</hi> so in foretelling the foregoing <hi>signs</hi> of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> he prefigures the foregoing <hi>signs</hi> of the <hi>later.</hi> And since he here intended the signs of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems</hi> dooms-day, only for <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of those signs which shall forerun the dooms-day of the World, and seeing that <hi>Types</hi> have always <hi>less</hi> in them than are in the <hi>things</hi> which they typifie
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:58668:276"/>
and prefigure, there is no doubt but those signs which shall forerun the last judgment will be much more <hi>eminent</hi> and <hi>illustrious,</hi> than those of <hi>Ierusalems</hi> judgment, which were intended only to <hi>Typifie</hi> and <hi>prefigure</hi> them, and accordingly St. <hi>Ierom</hi> tells us of an ancient <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Jewish Doctors (to which our Saviour in this Prediction seems plainly to refer) that for <hi>fifteen</hi> days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the <hi>general</hi> judgment there shall be transacted upon the Stage of <hi>Nature</hi> a continued Scene of fearful <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> shall swell to a prodigious height, and make a fearful noise with its tumbling Waves, the <hi>Heavens</hi> shall crack day and night with loud and roaring Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the <hi>Earth</hi> shall groan under hideous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, and be shaken with quotidian Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, the <hi>Moon</hi> shall shed forth purple streams of discoloured light, the <hi>Sun</hi> shall be cloathed in a dismal darkness, and the <hi>Stars</hi> shall shrink in their light, and twinkle like expiring Candles in the Socket, the <hi>Air</hi> shall blaze with Portentous Comets, and the whole <hi>frame</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> like a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Room shall be all hung round with mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and with Ensigns of horrour, and when these <hi>fatal symptoms</hi> appear upon the face of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, then shall the Inhabitants of the earth mourn, and the Sinners in <hi>Sion</hi> shall be horribly afraid being loudly <hi>forewarned</hi> by these astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Portents of the near approach of their <hi>everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Doom.</hi> Having thus briefly shewn what shall be the Signs of our Saviours coming to Judgment, I proceed to the</p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Third</hi> general, which was to shew the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>circumstances</hi> of his coming; and here
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:58668:276"/>
we will first consider the <hi>place from</hi> whence he is to come; Secondly, the <hi>State</hi> in which he is to come; Thirdly, the <hi>Carriage</hi> on which he is to come; Fourthly, the <hi>Equipage</hi> with which he is to come; Fifthly, the <hi>place to</hi> which he is to come.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The <hi>place from</hi> which he is to come, which is no other than the <hi>Highest Heavens,</hi> where he now lives and reigns in his exalted and glorified Humanity; for <hi>him must the Heavens receive till the time of the Restitution of all things,</hi> Acts 3.21. in that bright Region of eternal day, that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Angels and of <hi>spirits of just men made perfect,</hi> he is to reign in Person till the last and terrible day, and from <hi>thence</hi> he is to begin his Circuit when he comes to keep his general Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes upon earth, for he is to be <hi>revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with his mighty Angels,</hi> 2 Thess. 1.7. and to <hi>descend from Heaven with a shout,</hi> 1 Thess. 4.16. so that in the close of those dreadful Alarms which he will give the World by the preceding signs of his coming he will arise from his <hi>imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Seat</hi> at his Fathers right hand, and descend in person from those high habitations of inaccessible light, <hi>and every eye shall see him</hi> as he comes shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a Star from his Orb, and the sight of him shall affect the whole World with unspeakable <hi>joy</hi> or <hi>consternation</hi>; the <hi>righteous</hi> when they see him shall lift up their heads and <hi>rejoyce,</hi> because they know he is <hi>their</hi> Friend and brings the day of <hi>their</hi> redemption with him, <hi>they</hi> shall congratulate his Arrival and welcome him from Heaven with Songs of Triumph and deliverance: but as for the <hi>wicked,</hi> they shall <hi>shreik</hi> and <hi>lament</hi> at the sight of him, as being conscious to themselves that by a
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:58668:277"/>
thousand provocations they have render'd him their implacable <hi>Enemy</hi>; the sense of which will cause them to exclaim in the bitter Agonies of their souls;
<q>O yonder comes he whose <hi>mercies</hi> we have spurned, whose <hi>Authority</hi> we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, whose <hi>Laws</hi> we have trampled on, and all the methods of whose <hi>love</hi> we have utterly baffled and defeated; and now forlorn and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable that we are, how shall we abide his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, or whither shall we flee from his presence. O that some Rock would fall upon us, or that some Mountain would be so pitiful as to swallow us up and bury us from his sight for ever. But wo are we! within these few moments the Rocks and Mountains will be gone, the Heavens and Earth will melt away, and nothing will be left besides our selves for his fiery indignation to prey on.</q>
Thus shall the <hi>sight</hi> of the <hi>son of man</hi> descending from his Throne in the Heavens to judge the World, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire his <hi>friends</hi> with unspeakable <hi>joy,</hi> and strike his <hi>enemies</hi> with <hi>terrour</hi> and <hi>confusion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. We will consider the <hi>State</hi> in which he is to come, which shall be <hi>far different</hi> from that in which he came sixteen hundred years ago. Then he came in an <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>despicable</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, clouded with poverty and grief, and oppressed with all the <hi>innocent infirmities</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature; but at the last day he shall come in his <hi>glorified state,</hi> cloathed in that Celestial Body which he now wears at the Right hand of God. For so, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. the Angel assures his Disciples, <hi>This same Iesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:58668:277"/>
manner as you have seen him go into heaven,</hi> that is, he shall return to Judgment in that self-same glorified Body wherein you now see him ascend; and what a glorious one that is we may partly learn from that majestick description of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>In the midst of the seven Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks was one like the Son of man, his head and his hair were white as wool as white as snow, his eyes were as a flame of fire, and his countenance was as the Sun shining in its strength.</hi> And partly from his <hi>transfiguration</hi> on the Mount, which was but a short <hi>essay</hi> and <hi>specimen</hi> of his <hi>Glorification</hi>; for it's said, that <hi>his face did shine as the Sun, and that his Raiment was white as the light,</hi> white with those beams of Glory which from his transfigured Body shone through all his Apparel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.2. When therefore he descends from Heaven to judg the World, it shall be with this <hi>glorified</hi> Body, this Body of <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>immaculate</hi> splendor, with its hair shining like threds of light, its eyes spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with beams of Majesty, and its face display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a most beautiful lustre, and its whole substance shedding forth from every part a dazling glory round about it; and this I conceive is that which he himself calls <hi>his own glory,</hi> Luke 9.26. <hi>When he</hi> (i. e. the Son of man) <hi>shall come in his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that is, the glory of that illustrious heavenly Body wherein he is now arrayed; besides which <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>luminous Robe,</hi> in which like a meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sun he shall visibly shine over all the World; the aforecited Text tells us, that he shall also come <hi>in the glory of his Father,</hi> by which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is meant that which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> and the Scripture <hi>the glory of the Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="530" facs="tcp:58668:278"/>
viz. a body of bright shining fire in which the Lord was especially present, and with which as the Psalmist expresseth it, <hi>he covered himself as with a Garment,</hi> Psalm 104.2. for in 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.8. we are told, that <hi>he shall be revealed from heaven with flaming fire</hi>; and so he descended on the Mount <hi>in fire</hi>; Exod. 19.18. and that fire is called <hi>the Glory of the Lord,</hi> Exod. 24.17. That fire therefore in which our Saviour shall <hi>be revealed from Heaven,</hi> seems to be of the same nature with that fiery <hi>Shechinah</hi> or visible glory of the Lord in which he descended on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> though doubtless it will be far more glorious, as being designed to adorn a far more glorious <hi>solemnity.</hi> And this <hi>Glory</hi> being added to the <hi>natural</hi> bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and splendor of his glorified Body will cause him to <hi>outshine</hi> the Sun, and drown all the lights of heaven in the conquering brightness of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. So that when he comes forth from his aetherial Palace, and appears upon the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern heaven, that immense Sphere of <hi>visible glory</hi> which will then surround him, will in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye spread and diffuse it self over all the Creation, and cause both the Heavens and the Earth to glitter like a flaming fire.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Thirdly, We will consider the <hi>Carriage</hi> on which he is to come, which as the Scripture tells us shall be a <hi>Cloud</hi>; so <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. the Angels tell his Disciples who stood gazing after him as he was ascending into Heaven, <hi>the same Iesus which is taken from you into Heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into Heaven.</hi> Now, if you would know how that was, the 9th Verse will inform you, where it's said, that <hi>he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:58668:278"/>
up, and a Cloud received him out of sight,</hi> and therefore as he ascended into Heaven on a Cloud, so <hi>in like manner</hi> he shall from thence descend upon a <hi>Cloud</hi> also; and accordingly our Saviour himself declares, that <hi>we shall see the Son of man coming on the Clouds of Heaven in power and great glory,</hi> Mat. 24.30. So also <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.64. <hi>Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of Power and coming in the Clouds of Heaven</hi>; and in this very manner do the <hi>Iews</hi> expect the coming of their Messias, as appears by that gloss of one of their ancient Masters on <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10. <hi>si meru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erint Iudaei veniet in nubibus Coeli,</hi> which <hi>Raimund. Pug. fid.</hi> thus explains, <hi>If ever the</hi> Jews <hi>deserve that the Messias should come, he shall come gloriously according to the Prophet</hi> Daniel, <hi>that is, in the Clouds of Heaven.</hi> And then he tells us farther, <hi>ideo moderni Iudaei dicunt Messiam non venisse quia non viderunt eum venire in nubibus coeli, therefore do the modern</hi> Jews <hi>say, that the Messias is not yet come because they never saw him coming in the clouds of Heaven</hi>; and it seems very probable that the great offence which the high Priest took at our Saviours saying, that <hi>they should hereafter see him coming in the clouds of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 26.64, 65. was this, that it was a <hi>tradition</hi> among them that the Messias should <hi>so</hi> come, and that therefore he look'd upon that saying of our Saviour as a <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous</hi> pretence to his being the <hi>Messias</hi>; as much as if he should have said, though I have done enough already to convince you that I am the Messias, yet you shall hereafter see that very sign of my being the Messias upon which you so much depend, and without which you will not
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:58668:279"/>
believe, <hi>viz. my coming in the clouds of Heaven</hi>; which therefore I am apt to think is <hi>the sign of the Son of man in Heaven,</hi> of which our Saviour speaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.30. For so not only the <hi>Iews</hi> do Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter their Messias, but also the <hi>Heathen</hi> their Gods cloathed in a <hi>Cloud.</hi> Thus <hi>Homer.</hi> Iliad. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. represents God coming to <hi>Diomedes <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, with his shoulders wrap'd in a Cloud</hi>; and so also <hi>Virgil</hi> represents <hi>Iupiter</hi> coming to assist <hi>Aeneas, Aen.</hi> 7 — <hi>Radiis ardentem lucis &amp; auro — ipse manu quatiens ostendit ab aethere nubem,</hi> i. e. <hi>shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a Cloud from Heaven, flaming with rays of light and Gold.</hi> So that to appear in <hi>Clouds,</hi> it seems, was looked upon both by <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> as a <hi>divine</hi> sign and Character, and accordingly this sign was given by our Saviour to the <hi>Iews</hi> in that glorious representation of a <hi>Captain</hi> with his Legions issuing out of the <hi>Clouds</hi> a little before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> recorded at large both in <hi>Iosephus</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and will hereafter be given to the whole World in a far more <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> manner at the opening of the day of <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; for then, as the Psalmist expresses it, he will <hi>make the Clouds his Chariots</hi> and ride down from the Heavens on them in a triumphal proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, shining with unspeakable <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi>: So that as when he <hi>ascended</hi> a bright and Radiant <hi>Cloud</hi> was prepared to receive and carry him up to the Seat of the blessed; so when he <hi>descends</hi> there will be a vast sheet of condensed <hi>aeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r</hi> in the form of a <hi>radiant Cloud</hi> (and such it's probable was that on which he <hi>ascended</hi>) prepared to receive him, and to waft him down from above to the place appointed for the general As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>izes,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:58668:279"/>
and this very <hi>Cloud</hi> or bright <hi>aetherial substance,</hi> on which he shall come will perhaps be that <hi>Throne of Glory</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31. on which he shall sit whilest he is administring judgment to the World; for this substance being not only <hi>naturally lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,</hi> but also <hi>accidentally illuminated</hi> from the Sun of Righteousness whom it bears; will to be sure be sufficiently Glorious to deserve the name of <hi>A Throne of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, We will consider the <hi>Retinue</hi> and <hi>Equipage</hi> with which he shall come, which as the Scripture tells us will consist of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble myriads of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi>; for immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the notice that he is going down to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize the general Judgment, all those <hi>blessed spirits</hi> of just men made perfect, whom he hath redeemed and glorified from the beginning of the World, shall forsake their mansions of glory to <hi>attend</hi> him in his progress; for so <hi>Enoch prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of old, behold the Lord comes with ten thousand of his Saints to execute judgment on the ungodly,</hi> Jude 14.15. and that by these <hi>ten Thousand,</hi> he means the whole body of the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, is evident by that passage of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.13. where he prays that they might be established in their Christian course <hi>till the coming of the Lord Iesus with all his Saints,</hi> and indeed, since they are all to re-assume their <hi>bodies</hi> and to be made <hi>partakers</hi> of the Glorious <hi>Resurrection,</hi> it's necessary that they should all come down along with him and return to this <hi>earth,</hi> where the <hi>old matter</hi> of those bodies lies, wherein they are to be <hi>reinvested</hi>; and to this illustrious retinue of glorified <hi>Saints</hi> shall be joyned the heavenly
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:58668:280"/>
hosts of the holy <hi>Angels</hi>; for so Christ himself tells us, <hi>that he shall come in his own glory, and in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of his holy Angels,</hi> Luke 9.26. and that <hi>he shall come in his glory and all his holy Angels with him,</hi> Mat. 25.31. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that he shall <hi>be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels,</hi> 2 Thess. 1.2. And as the <hi>Angels</hi> shall come down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, so in all probability they shall come in a <hi>glorious appearance,</hi> cloathed in bright <hi>aetherial</hi> bodies, in which to adorn the triumphs of that glorious <hi>day,</hi> they shall be conspicuous to all the Inhabitants of the Earth. Neither shall their coming with him be only for <hi>shew</hi> and <hi>pomp</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Scripture plainly tells us that they shall <hi>minister</hi> to him in that great transaction. For at his issuing forth from the heaven of heavens, these mighty hosts of <hi>Angels</hi> shall <hi>march before</hi> him with the <hi>Archangel</hi> in the head of them, who with a mighty voice or sound like that of a <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> shall send forth an <hi>awakening summons</hi> to all the Inhabitants of the grave to come forth and appear before the Judgment Seat; at which Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous <hi>voice,</hi> which with an <hi>all-enlivening pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> shall be reverberated through all the vault of <hi>heaven,</hi> and penetrate the most secret reposito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>dead</hi> shall <hi>rise</hi> and the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> shall be <hi>changed</hi> and <hi>transfigured,</hi> and all shall be set before the dread Tribunal to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go their <hi>Trial</hi> and receive their <hi>doom:</hi> For so 1 Thess. 4.16. <hi>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first</hi>; and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead is made the consequence of
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:58668:280"/>
the sounding this Trumpet, <hi>for the Trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible</hi>; And so also <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. our Saviour tells us, that at his coming on the clouds of Heaven, he will <hi>send his Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds</hi>; from whence it is evident that the <hi>Angels</hi> then <hi>minister</hi> to him to <hi>raising</hi> the dead, and <hi>assembling</hi> them to Judgment; and hence that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>voice</hi> of the <hi>Archangel</hi> in the above cited 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.10. is elsewhere called <hi>the voice of the Son of God,</hi> John 5.25. because as it will be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by his <hi>power,</hi> so it will be pronounced by his <hi>authority</hi>; and as they shall minister to him in <hi>raising</hi> the dead to be <hi>judged,</hi> so shall they also in <hi>executing</hi> his Sentence and Judgment; for so <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.41, 42. He tells us, <hi>the Son of man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom all things that offend, and them which do ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and shall cast them into a furnace of fire, there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</hi> From whence it's evident that when he hath pronounced <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> on the <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> he will by the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry</hi> of his <hi>Angels</hi> chase them into that everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>fire,</hi> whereunto he hath <hi>doomed</hi> and <hi>devoted</hi> them. Thus when he comes to judg the World all his holy <hi>Angels</hi> shall come with him, and that not only to contribute to the <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>splendor</hi> of his Circuit, but also to <hi>minister</hi> to him in his Judgment; so that his <hi>retinue</hi> shall consist of all the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> who shall all come forth together with him and bear him company in this his <hi>Triumphant progress</hi> through the skies: by which we may easily imagine what an <hi>amazing spectacle</hi>
                  <pb n="536" facs="tcp:58668:281"/>
his coming down from heaven will be to the Inhabitants of the earth, when they shall <hi>see</hi> him descend from his <hi>Imperial Seat</hi> far above the star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Skies with all the <hi>Train-bands</hi> of <hi>heaven</hi> about him, the <hi>Captain</hi> of the Angelical Host in the front of innumerable <hi>Angels</hi> marching before him, and with his mighty <hi>Trump</hi> ringing a peal of Thunder through the Universe, and with ten thousand thousands of the <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>just</hi> men made <hi>perfect,</hi> following after him with <hi>Crowns</hi> of glory on their heads, and Songs and <hi>Halelujahs</hi> in their mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">V. And lastly, We will consider the <hi>place to</hi> which he is to come, concerning which all that is certain from Scripture is this, that when he comes down from He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For so 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.17. it is said of the righteous, that after their being <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> or <hi>changed</hi> they shall be <hi>caught up in the Clouds to meet the Lord in the Air,</hi> which is a plain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Lord will sit in judgment on them in the <hi>Air,</hi> since thither they will be caught up to him after they are <hi>raised</hi> and <hi>judged.</hi> Thus in that very <hi>Air,</hi> which is now the seat of the <hi>Devils</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, shall Christ <hi>fix</hi> his <hi>Throne</hi> to manifest to all the World the consummation of his <hi>Victory</hi> over the Powers of darkness.

reign, and in the publick view of the World shall even in their own dominion <hi>spoil those Hellish Principalities and Powers,</hi> and having chained them at his Chariot Wheels, <hi>make a shew of them openly, triumphing over them</hi>; there where they now <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer</hi> and <hi>tyrannize</hi> over this wretched World shall he set his foot upon their <hi>necks,</hi> and from thence shall he tread them down into <hi>everlasting darkness</hi> and <hi>despair.</hi> Thus that he may expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the more publick <hi>view,</hi> and the Devil to the more publick <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>confusion</hi> he will choose to keep his general Assizes in the <hi>Air.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore arrived into the airy Regions, after a long and glorious progress from the highest heaven, there he shall sit down upon <hi>the Throne of his glory</hi> (as some think) over against Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> the place from whence he <hi>ascended,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all People, Nations and Languages shall be gathered before him to receive their everlasting <hi>Doom.</hi> And now let us imagine with our selves in what a <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>tremendous Majesty</hi> he will appear to the World from his judgment seat, whence every Eye shall see him shine in his <hi>own,</hi> his <hi>Fathers,</hi> and his <hi>Angels</hi> glory, who in a bright <hi>Corona</hi> shall sit round about him like so many Stars about a Sun, and where as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. he shall exhibit himself to publick view, cloathed in <hi>garments as white as snow, with the hair of his head like the pure wooll, sitting on a Throne like the fiery flame, and its Wheels as burning fire, with a fiery stream issuing out from before him, and a thousand thousands ministring unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him, whilst the Iudgment is set, and the

Their <hi>Citation</hi> or <hi>Summons.</hi> 2. Their personal

                  <hi>Appearance</hi> before the Judgment Seat. 3. Their <hi>Trial.</hi> 4. Their <hi>Sentence.</hi> 5. Their <hi>Assumption</hi> into the clouds of heaven.</p>
               <p n="1">I.

before this glorious <hi>Tribunal</hi> or bright <hi>Iudgment-Seat</hi> shall all the Assembly of the <hi>Righteous</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to undergo a <hi>merciful</hi> Trial, and receive a <hi>happy</hi> Doom. Here shall the glorious company of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the goodly fellowship of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> the noble Army of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> the holy <hi>Church</hi> throughout all the World, both Militant and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, meet, and in one entire body present themselves before their <hi>blessed Redeemer</hi>; who looking down from his exalted Throne shall at one view see all the Congregation of his <hi>Saints</hi> before him, and with infinite complacency sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh the fruit of the <hi>travel</hi> of his <hi>Soul,</hi> and the mighty purchase of his <hi>precious bloud</hi>; for so the Apostle tells us that <hi>we must all stand before his Iudgment Seat.</hi> Rom. 14.10.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the Righteous doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so include their <hi>Trial</hi>; for so the Apostle assures us, <hi>We must all appear (i. e.</hi> we Righteous as well as others) <hi>before the Iudgment-Seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10. which plainly implies, that even the <hi>Righteous</hi> shall undergo an impartial <hi>trial</hi> of their deeds; that so they may receive a <hi>reward</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to them; and more expresly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12. he tells us, that <hi>we must every one of us give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himself to God,</hi> and if <hi>every one,</hi> then to be sure the <hi>Righteous</hi> must as well as the <hi>wicked:</hi> not that there will be any <hi>doubt</hi> of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Righteous in the breast of the Judge, to whose all-seeing Eye the darkest secrets of all hearts lie open; but yet for othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="542" facs="tcp:58668:284"/>
                  <hi>publick vindication</hi> of their wronged <hi>innocence,</hi> that all that infamy and scandal with which their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Enemies have bespattered them may be wiped off before men and Angels, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assoiled before all the World they may tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph for ever in a <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>glorious reputation.</hi> And secondly, That all those <hi>brave</hi> and <hi>unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> acts of secret <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> to which none but <hi>God</hi> and <hi>themselves</hi> were <hi>conscious,</hi> may be brought into the <hi>open light,</hi> and to their everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renown <hi>proclaimed</hi> throughout all the vast As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Spirits: for now we shall see all those <hi>modest souls</hi> unmask'd, whose <hi>silent and retired gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> do make so little shew and noise in the world, and all their humble <hi>pieties</hi> and bashful <hi>beauties</hi> which scarce any Eye ever saw, but Gods, shall be exposed to the <hi>publick</hi> view and <hi>general</hi> applause of Saints and Angels. Thirdly, They shall be tried also for the vindication of Gods <hi>impartial</hi> procedure in proportioning their <hi>reward</hi> to their <hi>vertue</hi>; that so the degrees of each mans profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in piety and vertue being exposed to the view of the world by an <hi>impartial trial,</hi> Angels and Men may be convinced that in distributing the different degrees of happiness the Almighty Judge is no way <hi>biassed</hi> by a fond <hi>partiality</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> of <hi>persons,</hi> but that he proceeds upon <hi>immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Principles</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> and doth exactly <hi>adjust</hi> and <hi>ballance</hi> his <hi>rewards</hi> with the degrees and numbers of our <hi>deserts</hi> and <hi>improvements</hi>; that so even those that are set <hi>lowest</hi> in those blessed Forms and Classes of glorified Spirits may not <hi>envy</hi> those that are <hi>above</hi> them, or <hi>complain</hi> that they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced no higher; but every one may chearfully
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:58668:284"/>
acknowledge himself to be placed where he <hi>ought</hi> to be, as being fully convinced that he is only so many degrees inferiour to others in <hi>glory,</hi> as they are superiour to him in divine <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Fourthly and lastly, The <hi>Righteous</hi> shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo this <hi>Trial</hi> for the more glorious manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the divine <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>goodness.</hi> For which reason I am apt to think that even their <hi>sins</hi> of which they have dearly and heartily repented shall in this their trial be <hi>exposed</hi> and brought upon the Stage, that so in the free pardon of such an infinite number of them the whole Congregation of the blessed may behold and admire the <hi>infinite</hi> extent of the <hi>divine mercies,</hi> and be thereby the deeper affected with, and more vigorously excited to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate with Songs of praise the goodness of their <hi>merciful Iudge.</hi> For these reasons the Wise man tells us, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.14. that <hi>God shall bring every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thing to judgment whether it be good, or whether it be evil</hi>; which Proposition being universal, must extend to the <hi>Righteous</hi> as well as to the <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi> But yet though their sores shall be then laid open, it shall be done by a <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi> hand, by a <hi>serene Conscience,</hi> and a <hi>smiling Iudge,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>angry</hi> look, or <hi>severe</hi> reflection, or any other circumstance, but what shall contribute to the joys and triumphs of that day, shall <hi>read</hi> over all the Items of their guilt, and then <hi>cancel</hi> them for ever. For</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the Righteous doth also include their <hi>Sentence.</hi> Although to us whose ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are so slow and leisurely by reason of the unwieldiness of these fleshly Organs with which we act, such a <hi>particular trial</hi> as hath been before de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>scribed
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:58668:285"/>
of such an infinite number of men and women may seem to require an unreasonable <hi>length</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> yet if we consider that then both the <hi>Iudge,</hi> and those who are to be <hi>judged</hi> shall be array'd in <hi>spiritual</hi> bodies, in which they will be able to act with unspeakable <hi>nimbleness</hi> and <hi>dispatch,</hi> we shall find that a <hi>little</hi> time comparatively may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well suffice for so great a transaction; for the <hi>Iudge</hi> being one that can attend to <hi>infinite causes</hi> at once without any distraction, and they who are to be <hi>judged,</hi> being by reason of their <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi> in a condition to attend to every <hi>ones</hi> trial, while they are undergoing their <hi>own,</hi> I see no reason we have to imagine that they shall be tried <hi>successively</hi> one after another, and if not, why may we not suppose that we shall all be tried <hi>together</hi> at the same time, and consequently that the trial of <hi>all</hi> may be transacted in as <hi>short</hi> a time as the trial of <hi>one.</hi> And that they shall all be <hi>tried together</hi> is very probable, since it is apparent from Scripture that they shall all be <hi>sentenced</hi> together, for thus <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Then shall the King say to those on his right hand, i. e.</hi> to them all together, <hi>Come ye blessed,</hi> &amp;c. Having first by an <hi>accurate</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manifested their integrity to all the world, he shall arise out of his flaming Throne, and with an audible voice, and smiling Majesty, pronounce their Sentence <hi>all together</hi> in these, or such like words, <hi>Come ye blessed Children of my Father inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world,</hi> to which welcome Sentence they will doubtless all immediately resound a joyful Choir of <hi>Halelujahs</hi> through Heaven and Earth, <hi>Allelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, Salvation, and Glory, and Power be to the Lord

our God, for true and righteous are his Iudgments' Salvation be unto our Lord that sitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb; for wonderful are thy works, O Lord God Almighty, just and true are thy ways, O thou King of Saints.</hi> And now all their business being <hi>finished</hi> here below, they shall from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be no longer detained in this Vale of <hi>tears</hi> and <hi>misery,</hi> but with overjoyed hearts shall take their leave of it for ever. For</p>
               <p n="5">V. And lastly, Another thing implyed in this their <hi>Iudgment</hi> is their <hi>Assumption</hi> into the <hi>Clouds</hi> of heaven. For their blessed Lord having thus publickly acquitted and pronounced them blessed, they shall immediately feel the happy effect of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for now he will no longer suffer them to stand below at the <hi>Bar,</hi> but from thence will call them up to his <hi>Tribunal,</hi> there to give them a nearer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to his beloved <hi>person</hi> and more intimate parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of his <hi>glory.</hi> At which powerful <hi>call</hi> and <hi>invitation</hi> of his, they shall in an instant all take wing together like a mighty flock of pure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Doves, and fly aloft into the air, singing and warbling as they go to meet their Redeemer in the Clouds of Heaven. For so the Apostle in 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Then</hi> (that is, after their Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Judgment) <hi>we which are alive and remain,</hi> who never died, but only have been changed and glorified, <hi>shall be caught up together with them</hi> who shall be raised from the dead <hi>into the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall be ever with the Lord.</hi> For to be sure that rapturous love which the <hi>sight</hi> and <hi>sentence</hi> of their Saviour hath by this time kindled in their pious breasts, will wing their souls with <hi>vehement</hi> desire to be with him, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:58668:286"/>
cloath'd with glorified bodies that are as <hi>vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> and <hi>active</hi> as their <hi>Souls</hi>; as <hi>nimble</hi> and <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite</hi> as their <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>wishes,</hi> it will be in their <hi>power</hi> soon to accomplish their <hi>desire,</hi> and fly from hence up to the Throne of their Lord.</p>
               <p>And now this being the <hi>first</hi> general meeting of the blessed Jesus and his Church; the <hi>first</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view that ever was between the <hi>heavenly Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom</hi> and his <hi>holy Bride,</hi> O the dear welcomes, the infinite mutual congratulations that will pass between them! How will they now melt in love and dissolve in mutual flames! now when like long absent Lovers they are safe arrived into each others Arms, never, never to be parted more.</p>
               <p>And now this joyful <hi>meeting</hi> being consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they begin to prepare for a most <hi>dreadful so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,</hi> and that is the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>Wicked.</hi> In order to which the Judge will reassume his Throne, and place his <hi>Saints</hi> all round about in shining Circles ten thousand thousand together, that so as his Assessors they may bear a <hi>part</hi> in the ensuing Judgment; for this the Apostle asserts as a notorious principle of our Christian faith; <hi>Know ye not that the Saints shall judge the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.2. that is, that they shall not only <hi>accuse</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> the wicked World by the holy <hi>example</hi> of their lives, but also that they shall give their <hi>votes</hi> and <hi>suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> to that dreadful sentence which Christ shall pass upon them. And now the <hi>Iudge</hi> and his <hi>Assessors</hi> being set, proceed we to the</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Second</hi> Judgment, which is, that of the <hi>wicked,</hi> in which there are also five particulars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: First, their <hi>Citation</hi>; Secondly, their

for so S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his prophetique Vision of the day of Judgment, <hi>saw the dead both small and great standing before God,</hi> Rev. 20.12. and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.31, 32. we are told, that <hi>when the Son of man sits down upon the Throne of his Glory all Nations shall be gathered before him,</hi> that is, the impure Goats as well as the innocent Sheep, as he afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himself.

the World, their very <hi>inwards</hi> dissected, and the smallest threds and fibres of their <hi>hearts</hi> laid open and exposed to the view of men and Angels, their own <hi>shame</hi> and the intolerable rack of their <hi>consciences</hi> will force them to <hi>confess</hi> their Charge, and <hi>proclaim</hi> themselves guilty before all that vast Congregation of Spirits.

but alas poor souls they cry too <hi>late</hi>; their <hi>Iudg</hi> was once as importunate with them to have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon <hi>themselves,</hi> but because when <hi>he called they</hi> refused, when <hi>he</hi> stretched forth his hands <hi>they</hi> regarded not, now when <hi>they</hi> call <hi>he</hi> will not answer, when <hi>they</hi> cry <hi>he</hi> will not hear, but will <hi>laugh</hi> at their <hi>calamity,</hi> as they did at his <hi>counsel,</hi> and mock when their fear and destruction is come upon them.</p>
               <p n="5">V. And lastly, Another particular implied in this <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>wicked,</hi> is the <hi>execution</hi> of their Sentence. For immediately after their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is past by which they stand doomed to <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting fire,</hi> an <hi>everlasting fire</hi> shall be kindled round about them, a fire which within a few moments shall spread it self over all this <hi>lower World,</hi> and convert the whole <hi>Almosphere</hi> about us into a <hi>furnace</hi> of inquenchable flames; For then all those <hi>fiery particles</hi> which are every where intermingled with these terrestial Bodies, and have hitherto been kept within their <hi>proper limits,</hi> shall be <hi>disintangled</hi> and set <hi>free</hi> from those more gross and sluggish ones that now bind and fix them, and swarm together like so many sparks into one <hi>huge globe</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> which from the lower-most centre of the Earth shall spire up and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle upon all that Airy Heaven above, and with one continued flame fill all the vast <hi>expansum</hi>; all that <hi>fiery matter</hi> which is now dispersed up and down within the entrails of the Earth, shall by degrees gather together into <hi>Rivers</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> which rolling to and fro within, to force their way into the open Air, will perhaps produce those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> of which our Saviour speaks,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:58668:289"/>
by which at length the Earth being cleft and torn, it shall every where vomit out <hi>Torrents</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> from its flaming bowels; and at the same time the <hi>Sea</hi> shall boil and swell, and roar like water in a seething Pot, till 'tis all evaporated by the strugling flames from below, which having rarified its waters into vapours shall kindle those vapours into flames; and at the same time also the <hi>Heavens</hi> above shall groan and crack with incessant <hi>Thunder,</hi> accompanied with thick and fearful flashes of <hi>Lightning,</hi> which joyning with those vast streams of Fire that will be continually issuing out of the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> will make such a prodigious deluge of flames as will quickly overflow the whole World. For thus we are assured from Scripture, that <hi>the Element shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burnt up,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.10. So also St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Vision of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11. <hi>I saw a great white Throne and him that sate on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them:</hi> not that the <hi>matter</hi> of them shall be <hi>annihilated,</hi> but the <hi>form</hi> of them shall be <hi>destroyed</hi> by their being converted into an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Fire; and in this Fire shall those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned wretches live and suffer to eternal Ages. Hence it is called <hi>the vengeance of eternal fire</hi>; and we are told that it will be <hi>in flaming fire,</hi> that the Lord Jesus will <hi>render vengeance to all that know not God and obey not his Gospel,</hi> 2 Thess. 1.8. And that this flaming fire shall be the conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> seems plainly to imply, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. <hi>But the heavens and the earth
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:58668:290"/>
which are now—are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men</hi>; and being reserved unto fire against the day of perdition of ungodly men, we may justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the fire it is reserved to, will be the Perdition of ungodly men. Thus upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours pronouncing those dreadful words, <hi>Go ye cursed into everlasting fire,</hi> the persons concerned will immediately perceive the dire effects; for all on a sudden they will see the <hi>Clouds</hi> from above, and the <hi>Earth</hi> from beneath casting forth <hi>Torrents</hi> of <hi>fire</hi> upon them, which in an instant will set all the World in a Blaze about their ears; At the sight of which all this <hi>wretched</hi> World will be turned into a mournful Stage of <hi>Horrours,</hi> in which the miserable <hi>actors</hi> being seized with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible <hi>amazement</hi> to see themselves all on a sudden encompassed on every side with flames, will raise a hideous <hi>Roar and outcry, millions</hi> of burning men and women <hi>shrieking</hi> together, and their noise shall mingle with the Archangels <hi>Trumpet,</hi> with the <hi>Thunders</hi> of the <hi>dying</hi> and <hi>groaning</hi> Heaven, and the <hi>crack</hi> of the dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving World that is sinking into eternal ruins. In which <hi>miserable state</hi> of things whither can the poor Creatures fly, or where can they hope to find a Sanctuary? If they go up to the tops of the <hi>Mountains</hi>; there they are but more openly <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> to the dreadful lightnings of Heaven; if they go down into the <hi>holes</hi> and <hi>caverns</hi> of the <hi>Rocks</hi>; there they will be <hi>swallowed</hi> up in the burning furnaces of the Earth; if they descend into the <hi>deep</hi>; there they will soon be overtaken with a storm of fire and brimstone; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:58668:290"/>
they go the vengeance of God will still pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue them with its everlasting burnings. And thus having <hi>no retreat</hi> left them, <hi>no avenue</hi> to <hi>escape</hi> out of this burning World, here they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for ever surrounded with <hi>smoak,</hi> and <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>darkness,</hi> and wrap'd in fierce and merciless <hi>flames,</hi> which like a shirt of burning pitch will stick close to, and pierce through and through their passive bodies, and for ever <hi>prey</hi> upon, but never <hi>consume</hi> them.</p>
               <p>And now the Almighty Judg having seen his dread <hi>sentence executed,</hi> will arise from his Throne, and from thence return to the Seat of the blessed in a <hi>solemn</hi> and <hi>Glorious Triumph</hi> with all his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly myriads of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> who as they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him through the Air and aether, will with loud <hi>Hosanna</hi>'s and triumphant <hi>acclamations</hi> cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the praises of their <hi>Redeemer.</hi> Thus shall the <hi>Ransomed</hi> of the Lord return with him, with Songs to the heavenly Zion, and everlasting <hi>joy</hi> shall be upon their <hi>heads,</hi> and everlasting <hi>praises</hi> in their <hi>mouths.</hi> For being arrived into those <hi>bliss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Regions</hi>; there in those glorified Bodies which they put on at their Resurrection, they shall live for ever in unspeakable <hi>pleasures</hi> and <hi>delights,</hi> and be entertain'd not only with all that <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which they enjoyed in the state of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration when they were only <hi>blessed Spirits</hi>; but also with all the <hi>satisfactions</hi> and <hi>delights</hi> that their <hi>glorified Bodies</hi> can require and enjoy. So that now their blessedness shall be <hi>consummate,</hi> and all the capacities of their humane nature compounded of body and soul shall be <hi>fulfilled with</hi> bliss, till they overflow and can contain no
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:58668:291"/>
more. But <hi>wherein</hi> the happiness of their <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Bodies</hi> shall consist, I shall not presume to inquire, the Scripture being silent concerning it. And what the happiness of their <hi>souls</hi> shall be, hath been shewn at large before, Part 1. c. 3, 4. So that as to that <hi>state</hi> of <hi>eternal life,</hi> in which our Saviour shall place his <hi>faithful servants</hi> in the conclusion of this great Judgment, I need say no more of it in this place.</p>

               <head>SECT. XI. Concerning the conclusion and surrender of the Kingdom of Christ.</head>

For our better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, we are to consider that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ is twofold: First, <hi>Essential,</hi> as he is God Essential, and doth subsist in the divine Essence; by the <hi>supereminent perfections</hi> of which he being exalted above all things, hath an <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Right</hi> of Dominion over all things; and this is <hi>Co-eternal</hi> with himself, and is as <hi>inseparable</hi> to him as his <hi>Being; this</hi> he can no more deliver up

than he can his <hi>Godhead,</hi> which without ceasing to <hi>be</hi> can never cease to be <hi>supreme</hi> over all things.

For now <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> being made completely one, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Mediator <hi>ceases</hi> of its own accord; for <hi>a Mediator is not a Mediator of one,</hi> Gal. 3.20. and therefore the two parties being perfectly <hi>united,</hi> there is no farther use of a <hi>Mediator</hi> between them.

I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give a brief account of the whole passage, which lies in <hi>vers.</hi> 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>Then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the Kingdom to God even the Father, when he shall put down all Rule and all Authority, and all Power, for he must reign till he hath put all Enemies under his feet; the last Enemy that shall be destroyed is Death; for he hath put all things under his feet: but when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him, and when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him which did put all things under him, that God may be all in all</hi>; the whole sense and meaning of which passage, I shall cast into these Propositions:</p>
               <p>First, That the <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Dominion</hi> here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, was committed to him by God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That he is to possess this <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> so long and no longer, as till all things are actually <hi>subdued</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That during his <hi>possession</hi> of it, he is <hi>subject</hi> to the <hi>Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="559" facs="tcp:58668:292"/>Fourthly, That after his <hi>delivering</hi> it up to the <hi>Father,</hi> he will be otherwise <hi>subject</hi> to him than he is now.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That <hi>he</hi> being thus <hi>subjected</hi> to the <hi>Father,</hi> all <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> shall from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be immediately exercised by the <hi>Deity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. That the <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Dominion</hi> here spoken of, was committed to him by God the <hi>Father</hi>; and this is expresly affirmed, <hi>vers.</hi> 27. <hi>For he</hi> (i. e. the Father) <hi>hath put all things under his feet,</hi> which words are a quotation of <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Thou madest him to have Dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet</hi>; which words are to be understood <hi>literally</hi> of the <hi>first Adam,</hi> but <hi>mystically</hi> of the <hi>second</hi>; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent not only because 'tis here applied to Christ by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but also by the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> Heb. 2.7, 8. where he expresly tells us, that it was God the Father that <hi>crowned</hi> Christ <hi>with Glory and Honour, and that did set him over the works of his hands, and put all things in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection under his feet</hi>; and accordingly our Saviour himself declares, that <hi>all Power in Heaven and Earth was given him,</hi> i. e. by the Father, and that it was <hi>the Father that committed all judgment to him</hi>; and the Apostle expresly tells us, that it was <hi>God that exalted him with his own right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour,</hi> Acts 5.31. From all which it is evident that the Dominion which the Apostle here treats of, is not the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Dominion</hi> of Christ, which as he is God <hi>Essential,</hi> is <hi>Co-eternal</hi> with him; but that <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial</hi> Dominion which was <hi>committed</hi> to him by the voluntary disposal of his <hi>Father,</hi> and which
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:58668:293"/>
once he had not, and will hereafter <hi>cease</hi> to have.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That he is to possess this <hi>Kingdom or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> so long as, and no longer than till all things are actually <hi>subdued</hi> unto him. So <hi>vers.</hi> 24. you see the time of his <hi>delivering up this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> is then, <hi>when he shall have put down all Rule, and all Authority and Power,</hi> i. e. till he shall have <hi>converted</hi> or <hi>destroyed</hi> all those Powers of the Earth that oppose themselves against him; for so <hi>vers.</hi> 25, 26. <hi>For he must reign till he hath put all Enemies under his feet, the last Enemy that shall be destroyed is Death</hi>; which plainly implies, that when he hath conquered all <hi>Enemies,</hi> and destroyed <hi>Death,</hi> which is the last Enemy, by giving a glorious <hi>Resurrection</hi> to his faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, then, and not till then his <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Reign is to conclude: For so, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.1. to which the Apostle here refers; the Psalmist brings in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> thus bespeaking <hi>Iehovah</hi> the <hi>Son, The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou at my right hand until I make thine Enemies thy footstool</hi>; now to <hi>sit at the Right Hand of God,</hi> when ever 'tis applied to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> doth in Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways denote his <hi>possessing</hi> and <hi>exercising</hi> this his <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Kingdom; so that the meaning of the Psalmist is this; the <hi>Father</hi> hath Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Son</hi> to continue the exercise of his <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial</hi> Dominion, till such time as either by the dint of his Almighty Vengeance he hath tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled all his Enemies under foot, or by the power of his <hi>Grace</hi> reduced them voluntarily to prostrate themselves before him: and indeed, the <hi>end</hi> for which this Kingdom of our Saviour was erected
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:58668:293"/>
was to <hi>subdue</hi> the Rebellious World to God, and either to <hi>captivate</hi> men into a <hi>free submission</hi> to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Heavenly Will, which is its <hi>first</hi> intention; or if they will not yield, to make them the Triumph of his everlasting <hi>vengeance</hi>; which end at the day of Judgment will be fully accomplished; for then the <hi>fate</hi> of all the rational World will be <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>determined</hi>; then the <hi>faithful</hi> Subjects will be crowned, and the <hi>incorrigible</hi> Rebels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed; and so, one way or t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all things will be subdued unto him. So that from hence-forth the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of this his <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Dominion will <hi>cease,</hi> and when the <hi>end</hi> of it <hi>ceaseth,</hi> he who never doth any thing in vain, will immediately <hi>deliver</hi> it up into those hands from whence he received it. <hi>For when he shall have put down all Rule, and all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power,</hi> i. e. conquered and subdued all that resisted and opposed him, <hi>then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the Kingdom to God even the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. That during his <hi>possession</hi> of this Kingdom, he is <hi>subject</hi> to the Father. So <hi>Ver.</hi> 27. <hi>But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he</hi> (i. e. the Father) <hi>is excepted which did put all things under him.</hi> As if he should say; Do not mistake me, for when I say <hi>all things</hi> are put under <hi>him,</hi> my meaning is, all things <hi>except</hi> God the Father, for it was he that did put all things under him; and it's manifest that he who gave him this <hi>superiority</hi> over all things, must <hi>himself</hi> be <hi>superior</hi> to him; and indeed, considering Christ as <hi>Mediatorial</hi> King, he is no more than his Fathers <hi>Viceroy,</hi> and doth only act by <hi>deputation</hi> from him,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:58668:294"/>
and rule and Govern <hi>for</hi> him; and hence the Father stiles him <hi>his</hi> King, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Yet have I set my King upon my holy Hill of Zion.</hi> So that now he is subject to the Father in the capacity of a <hi>Vice-King</hi> to a supreme <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he doth in this capacity he doth in his <hi>Fathers Name</hi> and by his <hi>Authority</hi>; for he Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates as for <hi>men</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> in doing which he is our <hi>Advocate</hi>; so for <hi>God</hi> with <hi>men,</hi> in doing which he is our <hi>King.</hi> Gods part is to <hi>Govern</hi> us, and our part is to sue to him for <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,</hi> and <hi>both</hi> these parts our Saviour acts as <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and us: He acts <hi>our</hi> part for us in being <hi>Advocate,</hi> and <hi>Gods</hi> part for him in being <hi>King.</hi> So that in that Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which he <hi>now</hi> exercises over us, he is only the <hi>supreme Minister</hi> of his Fathers Power and Dominion, and as the Father reigns by his <hi>Ministry,</hi> so he reigns by the <hi>Fathers Authority.</hi> But tho now while his <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Kingdom doth continue, he is <hi>subject</hi> to the Father in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of it, yet from this passage of S. <hi>Paul</hi> it is evident</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That when he hath <hi>delivered</hi> it up to the Father, he will be <hi>otherwise</hi> subject to him than he is now; for so <hi>ver.</hi> 28. and <hi>when all things shall be subdued unto him,</hi> that is, <hi>actually,</hi> and as they will be at the day of Judgment, when the <hi>good</hi> are Crowned, and the <hi>wicked</hi> consigned to that fearful Execution, <hi>Then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that did put all things under him,</hi> which necessarily implies that then he should enter into a <hi>different</hi> state of <hi>subjection</hi> to the Father, from that wherein he was before.
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:58668:294"/>
Why <hi>Then shall the Son himself be subject to him?</hi> Was he not subject to him before? Yes, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he was, and therefore either this <hi>then</hi> must be impertinent, or then he shall be <hi>so</hi> subject to him as he was not <hi>before</hi>; before he was subject to him as he was his <hi>Mediatorial</hi> King or <hi>Viceroy,</hi> as he reigned under him and by his Authority, but <hi>then</hi> he is to be subject to him after a <hi>different</hi> manner. For the explication of which it is to be considered, that now the Son considered as <hi>Mediator,</hi> reigns under God in the right of what he did and suffered in his human Nature Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statically united to his God-head; for it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>he humbled himself and became obedient to the death, even the Death of the Cross that God highly exalted him,</hi> Phil. 2.8.9. Now 'twas as he was Man, that he <hi>became obedient to death,</hi> and 'twas in the right of that <hi>obedience</hi> that God exalted him to his Mediatorial Kingdom; so that now as Mediator he not only reigns in his <hi>human Nature,</hi> but in right of the <hi>passion</hi> of his <hi>human Nature</hi>; his <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Kingdom is the <hi>purchase</hi> of his <hi>Blood,</hi> by which he both obtained the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>for</hi> us, and Regal Power to execute it <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> us. When therefore he hath executed it to the full (as we are sure he will do at the day of Judgment) this <hi>Regal Power</hi> of his which he purchased with his Blood, will <hi>cease,</hi> as having fully accomplish'd that for which it was given and intended. And now he being to Reign no longer in right of the <hi>sufferings</hi> of his human Nature, his human Nature will be <hi>subject</hi> to the Father in a more <hi>different</hi> manner than it was <hi>before: Before</hi> it was subject to him as <hi>Authorized</hi>

in consideration of its passion to reign and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern under him, but <hi>then</hi> having <hi>delivered up</hi> its Reign and Government, it will be subject to him in a more <hi>private capacity,</hi> as the Presidents of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire were subject to <hi>Caesar</hi> while they governed under him, but when they <hi>rendered back</hi> their Character, they became his Subjects in a more <hi>private</hi> station.

<pb n="562" facs="tcp:58668:296"/>
no <hi>mediate</hi> or <hi>Mediatorial Governour</hi> between him and us to exact our obedience, and convey to us his favours and rewards, but that we may render all our duty immediately <hi>to him,</hi> and derive all our happiness immediately <hi>from him</hi>; so that as now Christ the <hi>Theantropos</hi> or <hi>God-man is all in all,</hi> Col. 3.11. because the Father doth all things, and governs all things by him, having <hi>given him all power in heaven and earth</hi>; so when this Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy ceases, God alone, or the Triune Godhead shall <hi>be all in all,</hi> because he shall do all things, and govern all things by <hi>himself immediately.</hi> Thus when <hi>the Son of Man</hi> is subjected to him that did put all things under him, that one divine Essence whence all things did proceed, and in which the Father, Son and Holy Ghost subsist, shall from thenceforth resume all Rule and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion to it self, and only <hi>the Son of God</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Father and the Holy Ghost shall reign. But yet in this purely divine Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is no doubt but those divine persons will still continue to act in <hi>subordination</hi> to each other, according to that <hi>natural subordination</hi> in which they are placed by their <hi>personal properties.</hi> For the Godhead being communicated <hi>from</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> the Father in the order of nature must necessarily be <hi>Prior</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> and the same <hi>Godhead</hi> being communicated to the Holy Ghost <hi>from</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> both Father and Son must also in order of nature be <hi>Prior</hi> to the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> So that between these Sacred Three there is an <hi>internal necessary subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> that can never be altered or inverted; and therefore there is no doubt but that as they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

be <hi>subordinate,</hi> so they will always <hi>act sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately.</hi> The <hi>Father</hi> as the first, the <hi>Begetter</hi> and the Fountain of Divinity will be always <hi>first</hi> and <hi>supreme</hi> in the divine Monarchy; the <hi>Son,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by him, will still reign in <hi>subordination</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as <hi>proceeding</hi> from both, will continue to reign in <hi>subordination</hi> to <hi>both.</hi> Thus to everlasting Ages only the Trinity in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity shall reign, and by its own <hi>immediate</hi> Will and Influence rule and bless all that Heavenly World over which it spreads its Almighty Wings, and so it shall <hi>be all in all.</hi>

                  <hi>our natures</hi> the better to <hi>accommodate</hi> his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this our degenerate <hi>state,</hi> which renders us extremely unfit to be governed <hi>immediately</hi> by God. It is true, whilst man continued in his Primitive <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Perfection,</hi> he was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition fit to <hi>converse</hi> with God face to face, and to live under his <hi>immediate</hi> Dominion, for then his <hi>Sense</hi> being under the conduct of his <hi>Reason,</hi> and all his <hi>brutal affections</hi> intirely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the government and directions of his <hi>superior faculties,</hi> he was as much ruled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the objects of his <hi>Reason,</hi> as he is now by those of his <hi>Sense,</hi> and was as powerfully moved and affected by what he only <hi>knew</hi> and <hi>believed,</hi> as he is now by what he <hi>sees</hi> and <hi>feels</hi>; so that then God, that great invisible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who is removed from all the perceptions of <hi>bodily sense,</hi> and is only perceivable by our <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> did as powerfully impress mans hopes and fears, and all the other principles of action in him as he could have done had he appeared as amiable and dreadful to the mans <hi>sight</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> as he then did to his <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>reason.</hi> In <hi>this state</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> therefore man was duly qualified to be governed <hi>immediately</hi> by God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his impressions, and to be moved and acted by the over-ruling influence of his immense per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. But when once he had <hi>degenerated</hi> from this <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>blessed State</hi> of his nature, and had thrown off the Government of his <hi>reason,</hi> and subjected himself to the tyrannick sway of his brutal <hi>appetites,</hi> he thereby unqualified himself to live under Gods <hi>immediate</hi> Dominion. For now he being governed by his sensual <hi>appetites,</hi>
                  <pb n="566" facs="tcp:58668:298"/>
and they by the sensual <hi>Objects</hi> that surround him, scarce any thing else can strike upon his hopes and fears, but what is <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>sensual,</hi> or if any thing else doth, to be sure some carnal object immediately <hi>interposes</hi> and breaks the stroke, and renders it <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>ineffectual</hi>; so that now <hi>God</hi> who is solely the object of our <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>reason,</hi> can scarce be admitted to speak with our <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> by which we are made to be governed, or if he be, his <hi>soft still voice</hi> is immediately drowned in the perpetual clamour which these <hi>sensitive goods</hi> and <hi>evils</hi> raise about us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having thus unqualified our selves by our <hi>Apostacy</hi> from the <hi>primitive state</hi> of our nature to live under the <hi>immediate</hi> Wing and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and he being resolved in tender <hi>commiseration</hi> to us, not to abandon us for ever, did in his infinite wisdom project a <hi>new Method</hi> of governing us more <hi>accommodated</hi> to this our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate <hi>state, viz.</hi> by uniting <hi>himself</hi> to sensible <hi>matter,</hi> and therein addressing to our <hi>bodily senses</hi> in audible voices, visible appearances, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in our own <hi>form</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi> which of all other sensible things we are most apt to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, to love, and honour, and reverence, and obey. For so immediately after his Fall God appeared to <hi>Adam,</hi> probably in a glorious <hi>human form,</hi> and spake to him in an audible voice, and afterwards he did the same to the Patriarchs, and to the whole Nation of the Jews from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> among whom he also dwelt in a <hi>visible glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>; by which means he acquired to himself the same advantage of governing those sensual men that sensible objects had, which by striking on
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:58668:298"/>
their bodily sense did more powerfully insinuate themselves into their Wills and Affections. But all these <hi>sensible appearances</hi> of God were only as so many <hi>preludia</hi> to his assuming <hi>our nature</hi> into personal union with his <hi>Godhead,</hi> and therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting himself familiarly to the bodily <hi>senses</hi> of mankind, which tho he now ceases to do, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exalted far above our sight on the right hand of God the Father, there to reign till the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of all things, yet seeing we believe he is there <hi>visible</hi> in himself, cloathed in a most <hi>glorious human form,</hi> we can by <hi>imagination</hi> supply the want of our <hi>sight</hi> of him, and reach him by our <hi>inward</hi> sense, tho we cannot come at him by our <hi>outward</hi>; and whereas were he a mere <hi>Spirit,</hi> we could have <hi>no imagination</hi> of him, because <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations</hi> are nothing but the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>sensible things,</hi> we can now by the strength of our <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi> fetch him down from the Heavens when we please, and set him before our <hi>minds</hi> in all that venerable <hi>Majesty</hi> wherein he sits at the right hand of his Father. So that tho he be never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to our <hi>outward</hi> sense, yet, which is almost equivalent, when ever we have occasion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with him, we can make him present to our <hi>inward, viz.</hi> our <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>imagination</hi>; into this spacious Gallery of the Pictures of sensible things our <hi>mind</hi> can walk when it pleases, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him in Effigie, tho it cannot see him face to face; and considering how much we are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this <hi>degenerate</hi> state of our nature by <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>imagination,</hi> as well as by <hi>sight</hi> and <hi>feeling,</hi> it is doubtless a most <hi>advantageous circumstance</hi> of Gods Government of the World, that he governs

               </p>
               <p>Considering therefore how much we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by our <hi>sense</hi> in this state of our Apostacy, it was doubtless a wonderful wise contrivance of God, who is a pure <hi>Spirit,</hi> to assume to himself some <hi>sensible</hi> matter, that therein by presenting himself to our <hi>outward</hi> or <hi>inward</hi> sense, he might strike the deeper aw on us, and thereby the more effectually rule and govern us.

be back'd with some impressions on his <hi>sense,</hi> and his predominant <hi>affections</hi> are those that are raised by the strokes of <hi>sensible</hi> objects upon the sensories of his Sight, and Taste, and Feeling, which the <hi>divine</hi> substance and perfections can never touch, they being purely <hi>spiritual</hi>; by which means that <hi>communication</hi> and <hi>intercourse</hi> which was between God and man, whilst man was governed by <hi>reason,</hi> is mightily <hi>disturbed</hi> and <hi>interrupted,</hi> tho it be not altogether <hi>stopt</hi> and <hi>intercepted</hi>; for still our reason (which was not <hi>extinguished</hi> by the degeneracy of our natures) suggests to us that there is a <hi>God,</hi> and inspires us with an <hi>awful</hi> sense of his divine perfections, which still maintains in us <hi>Religious</hi> Inclinations and Affections, whereby we are importuned and solicited to adore and worship; but we being under the Government of <hi>Sense,</hi> are thereby naturally inclined either to look upon God who is in himself a pure <hi>invisible Spirit</hi> under the notion of a <hi>sensible Being,</hi> and as such to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, (for so anciently some adored the <hi>Sun</hi> for God, others the universal material <hi>Nature,</hi> others such particular <hi>parts</hi> of it) and in this consists that <hi>gross Idolatry</hi> of worshiping <hi>false</hi> Gods, or at least to blend our conceptions of him with <hi>corporeal Phantasms</hi>; and then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press those Phantasms in outward visible <hi>Images,</hi> by them to excite and direct our Worship to him (for so in most Nations the supreme <hi>Numen</hi> was heretofore adored in <hi>Statues</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral shapes and figures copied from the several Images by which they represented him to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their own <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>roving imaginations</hi>)
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:58668:301"/>
and herein consists that more <hi>refined Idolatry</hi> of worshiping the <hi>true God</hi> in a <hi>false manner.</hi> Thus the <hi>general cause</hi> of all Idolatry is nothing but the <hi>general Apostacy</hi> of human nature from the life of <hi>reason</hi> to the life of <hi>sense,</hi> by which we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined either to transform God into a <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>sensible nature,</hi> or at least to <hi>assist</hi> our selves in conceiving of, and adoring and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping him by <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>visible Objects.</hi> To prevent which God hath been graciously pleased to assume some <hi>material substance,</hi> and therein from time to time to exhibit to mens eyes a visible presence of himself, which in Scripture is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called the <hi>Glory of the Lord,</hi> and by the ancient Jews the <hi>Shechinah</hi> or habitation of God, and consisted of a <hi>shining luminous</hi> matter, which exhibited a glorious lustre of flame or light set off with thick and solemn clouds; whence it is probable he is said to <hi>cover himself with light as with a garment,</hi> Psal. 104.2. and in this <hi>glorious appearance</hi> he conducted <hi>Israel</hi> through the Red Sea and Wilderness, came down upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and was seen by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Israel,</hi> and from thence removed into the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, where he fixed his abode between the Cherubins, and from whence he frequently displayed himself before the whole Congregation in the beams of that <hi>visible Glory</hi> which he there assumed, as the <hi>Symbol</hi> of his <hi>special presence</hi>; and by thus doing he took a most wise and effectual course not only to <hi>raise</hi> and <hi>excite</hi> their devotion, but also to <hi>restrain</hi> and <hi>confine</hi> it within its proper bounds and limits; for while men are under the government of <hi>sense,</hi> there is nothing hath that

prevalence with them to excite their affections, and fix their thoughts as <hi>material</hi> Phantasms; so that God by exhibiting to them a <hi>visible</hi> presence of himself, and thereby impressing their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a <hi>material</hi> Phantasm of his presence and Glory, did at once both spur their <hi>affections,</hi> and bridle their <hi>fancies</hi> from roving into wild si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes of him, and thereby take an effectual course to prevent the worshiping him by those <hi>outward Images</hi> which they exemplified from the similitudes which they framed of him in their own <hi>fancies,</hi> and having this <hi>visible</hi> glory to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their <hi>fancies,</hi> they had the <hi>less temptation</hi> from their <hi>sense</hi> to hunt after <hi>sensible</hi> similitudes and representations of him, that outward <hi>Shechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> which they sometimes saw, being a <hi>sufficient help</hi> to raise up their groveling <hi>minds</hi> and carnal <hi>affections</hi> to the contemplation and worship of his <hi>invisible glory</hi>; and that that outward <hi>visible glory</hi> in which he appeared to them was intended for this purpose seems plainly implied in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.12. where <hi>Moses</hi> tells them, that <hi>when God spake to them out of the midst of the fire they heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude</hi>; and so again, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. from whence he infers, <hi>Take ye therefore good heed unto your selves left ye corrupt your selves, and make ye a graven Image, the similitude of any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, the likeness of Male or Female,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 16.17. where by <hi>their seeing no similitude</hi> is not meant that they saw <hi>nothing</hi>; for God himself had promised <hi>Moses</hi> that <hi>the third day he would come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai,</hi> Exod. 19.11. and therefore in all probability they saw the <hi>fire</hi> or <hi>visible glory</hi> in which he

descended, for it is expresly said they <hi>saw</hi> it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.17. but this fire shining without any <hi>determinate form</hi> or <hi>shape,</hi> they might very well be said to <hi>see no similitude,</hi> for by <hi>similitude</hi> it is evident he means a <hi>determinate shape, ver.</hi> 16. where he bids them beware of <hi>making the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of any figure,</hi> so that the People saw God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in an unfigured flame, or <hi>visible</hi> glory that was cast into no <hi>determinate shape,</hi> (though within that it is probable, as was shewn before, God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Moses</hi> and the seventy Elders in a glorious <hi>humane shape.</hi>) And this it seems God deemed a <hi>sufficient</hi> help to inable them to <hi>fix</hi> their <hi>thoughts</hi> on, and <hi>determine</hi> their <hi>worship</hi> to <hi>himself</hi>; and therefore he strictly charges them to content themselves with this, and not let their fancies rove, as they were too prone to do, after formed <hi>similitudes</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of him, lest those <hi>Images</hi> should create in their minds false and opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>notions</hi> of him, and cause them to imagine the immense <hi>Godhead</hi> as the Heathen did, <hi>to be like unto Gold or Silver, or Stone graven by Art and mans device,</hi> Acts 17.29.

wont to display himself from the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Moses</hi>; so that the meaning of the words seems at least to be this, He dwelt among us in <hi>our nature</hi> just as heretofore he did in the Mosaick <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and in <hi>this Tabernacle</hi> of our Nature we <hi>Twice</hi> beheld him shining forth with the same Glory wherein he was wont to shine out of that <hi>Old Tabernacle</hi> from between the Cherubins. Since therefore Christ dwelt in our nature in the same <hi>manner,</hi> and therein appeared in the same visible <hi>Glory,</hi> that he formerly did in the Old Tabernacle, there is no doubt but he did it for the same ends and purposes; and therefore since <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>ends</hi> of his dwelling in that <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was to restrain men from running into <hi>Idolatry,</hi> there is no doubt but among others he intended <hi>this end</hi> also in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming our <hi>natures,</hi> than which there can be no <hi>visible</hi> appearance in nature more <hi>proper</hi> to <hi>excite</hi> our sluggish and to <hi>determine</hi> our roving devotions upon him; for since in this life of <hi>sense</hi> which we now lead, we need a <hi>sensible</hi> presence of God to raise up our minds and affections to him, in what presence could he have appeared to us more <hi>proper</hi> for this end than that of our own <hi>nature?</hi> a presence which is not <hi>confused</hi> like that of the Old Tabernacle, which was only a mixture of shapeless lights and shadows; but <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate</hi> and of our own <hi>form</hi> and <hi>shape,</hi> which of all others is most familiar to and most beloved and reverenced by us, and consequently of all others is most familiar to and most beloved and reverenced by us, and consequently of all others is most <hi>apt</hi> to encourage our <hi>prayers,</hi> and inflame our <hi>zeal,</hi> and raise our <hi>admiration.</hi> For in what

                  <hi>sensible</hi> appearance could God have more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully affected our <hi>sense,</hi> than in that which we are most inclined to <hi>love,</hi> most prone to trust to, and most accustomed to <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>obey</hi>; and than that in which alone we discern the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>reflections</hi> of those divine <hi>Attributes</hi> of Wisdom and Goodness, and Truth and Justice, for which we reverence and adore him? There being therefore no <hi>visible</hi> substance in which God could more advantageously exhibit himself to us in order to the <hi>exciting</hi> our worship to him, and <hi>determining</hi> it upon him than that of a <hi>humane form,</hi> he thought meet to assume our natures into a <hi>personal</hi> union with his Divinity, and therein to rule and govern us. So that now the <hi>Humanity</hi> of our Saviour is the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Shechinah</hi> of God, wherein <hi>the fulness of the Godhead dwelleth bodily,</hi> and these <hi>two natures</hi> united in <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> are the immediate object of our worship; wherefore as the ancient <hi>Iews fell upon their faces</hi> and worshipped when they beheld the <hi>Shechinah</hi> or <hi>glory of the Lord,</hi> their imagination being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>assisted</hi> and their affections <hi>excited, Levit.</hi> 9.24. So when we by our <hi>internal</hi> sense or <hi>imagination</hi> look up to the Glorified <hi>Humanity</hi> of our Saviour in Heaven, it is our duty to raise up our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Heaven by that <hi>sensible Shechinah</hi> of God, and thereupon to fall down and worship. But as the <hi>Iews</hi> when they fell down before their <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah,</hi> did not worship the <hi>visible light</hi> or <hi>glory</hi> separately from <hi>God,</hi> but as it was <hi>united</hi> to and <hi>assumed</hi> into conjunction with him, so neither ought we to worship our <hi>Shechinah,</hi> viz. the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> of our Saviour separately from his <hi>Divinity,</hi>

but in <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Conjunction</hi> with it; and in short, as it was utterly unlawful for the <hi>Iews</hi> to worship God in any <hi>other Shechinah</hi> or <hi>sensible appearance</hi> either unshapen or shaped than in that Glorious one which he himself vouchsafed to them, that being <hi>sufficient</hi> to affect their <hi>sense,</hi> and thereby to raise up their <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> to him; so is it utterly unlawful for us Christians to worship God in any <hi>other Shechinah, Image, similitude</hi> or <hi>visible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi> than that of the glorified <hi>humanity</hi> of our Saviour, that being <hi>sufficient</hi> to assist our <hi>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and elevate our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>devotions</hi> to him. For though we cannot behold his <hi>glorified Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> with our <hi>bodily</hi> Eyes now he is removed into Heaven, yet so neither did the <hi>Iews the Glory of the Lord</hi> (at least but very rarely) after the Ark whereupon it sat, was removed into the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> which was a figure of <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet as they being assured it was there, could easily view it in their <hi>imaginations,</hi> and thereby assist their <hi>devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; so we being assured from Scripture that Christs <hi>humanity</hi> is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> can look up thither in our <hi>imagination,</hi> and by beholding its glory <hi>there,</hi> lift up our heavy minds and affections to the eternal <hi>Divinity</hi> that inhabits it; so that if we Christians make any <hi>other Shechinah</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> to worship God in, besides his own <hi>humanity,</hi> which he himself made, and wherein he now dwells above in the Heavens, we are of all false worshippers the most <hi>inexcusable,</hi> because by assuming our <hi>humanity</hi> God hath vouchsafed to us such an Image and Shechinah of himself as is of all others the most <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> to excite and determine our Devotions.</p>

our <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Office,</hi> seeing he carries our <hi>kind</hi> in his own <hi>person,</hi> and is flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone, we may certainly depend upon it, that he will be as kind and as gracious to us as his <hi>Government</hi> and our <hi>happiness,</hi> which is involved in it, will permit him; that so long as we are <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> to him he will <hi>compassionate</hi> our weakness, and that when we have gone astray from him he will graciously receive us upon our humble <hi>submissions,</hi> that he will not load us beyond our <hi>strength,</hi> nor punish us beyond our <hi>demerit,</hi> but that he will readily <hi>assist</hi> us in all our needs and tenderly <hi>pity</hi> us in all our pitiable cases, and kindly <hi>accept</hi> of our honest endeavours and <hi>reward</hi> them beyond all our hopes and expectations; in short, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall be able to separate us from his favour, but only our own <hi>obstinacy</hi> and wilful <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and that though in this case he will be <hi>angry</hi> with us, yet he will <hi>wait</hi> to be <hi>gracious</hi> again in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of our <hi>Repentance,</hi> and not <hi>hastily</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us to <hi>everlasting</hi> ruin till we have sinned our selves past all <hi>hope</hi> of recovery.

that is influenced by <hi>ingenuous</hi> motives, it will sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie little or nothing to the <hi>amendment</hi> of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which notwithstanding its beautiful rine and outside, will still remain corrupt and rotten at the core.

If therefore it be possible to work up our degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate natures into a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>chearful</hi> obedience to God, one would think <hi>this consideration</hi> should do it, that he whom God hath constituted our <hi>King</hi> to demand our <hi>obedience,</hi> demands it in our <hi>own nature,</hi> which he assumed that he might <hi>die</hi> for us, and thereby <hi>release</hi> us from that dreadful obligation we were under to have <hi>died for ever.</hi> So that now while his <hi>Authority</hi> bespeaks our <hi>Awe</hi> and <hi>Reverence,</hi> his <hi>blood</hi> bespeaks our <hi>gratitude</hi> and <hi>ingenuity,</hi> and that in such Language, and with such powerful Rhetorick and perswasion as is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for us to resist, unless we are resolved to outvy the Devils themselves in <hi>ingratitude,</hi> who though they have been audacious enough to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the <hi>Authority</hi> of their Maker, were never so much Devils yet as to turn a deaf Ear to the <hi>vocal blood</hi> and <hi>wounds</hi> of a <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. And lastly, God governs us by his own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son in our <hi>own natures,</hi> that thereby he may give us the more ample <hi>assurance</hi> of our future <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> Had he continued to govern us by himself
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:58668:308"/>
                  <hi>immediately,</hi> we had wanted <hi>one</hi> of the most <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging instances</hi> of his immense bounty in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding</hi> obedience that ever was given to the World, and that is his advancement of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to that <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Royalty which he now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises at the right hand of the Majesty on high; for had our Saviour been God <hi>only, he</hi> had been incapable of <hi>Reward,</hi> his <hi>happiness</hi> as <hi>such,</hi> being so immense as that it can admit of no <hi>addition</hi>; but being <hi>Man</hi> as well as <hi>God,</hi> he is thereby <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated</hi> for all that <hi>vast reward</hi> which the possession of his <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Kingdom, together with an everlasting Heaven includes; and all this <hi>reward</hi> is the product of that <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>profound obedience</hi> which he render'd to his Father whilst he was in this World. So that now in <hi>him</hi> by whom God hath promised to <hi>reward</hi> our obedience, we have an <hi>illustrious instance</hi> of Gods liberality in <hi>rewarding</hi> Obedience; by <hi>his</hi> happy fate we may be fully assured that we shall not serve God for <hi>nought,</hi> but that the <hi>reward</hi> of our obedience shall ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand-fold exceed the <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>difficulty</hi> of it, for <hi>he</hi> is a <hi>man</hi> as well as <hi>we,</hi> though he be <hi>hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> united to <hi>God,</hi> and this <hi>man</hi> for some few years faithful <hi>service</hi> upon Earth, for revealing <hi>Gods Will</hi> to men, and exhibiting a perfect <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> to it, for exposing himself to some temporal <hi>Calamities</hi>; and finally for offering up himself a <hi>spotless Victim</hi> for the sins of the World, is now advanced to the utmost height of <hi>bliss</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> that it is possible for a Creature to arrive to; he is set <hi>far above all principality and power</hi>; he is <hi>served</hi> and <hi>Adored,</hi> as the only Potentate under God the Father throughout all the Heavenly

World; he is <hi>worship'd</hi> and <hi>Celebrated</hi> by Cherubin and Seraphin, by Archangels and Angels, he is <hi>extol'd</hi> in the Songs of the Patriarchs and Prophets, the Apostles and Evangelists, the Confessors and Martyrs; and his Name is <hi>resounded</hi> with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting <hi>praises</hi> and <hi>thanksgivings</hi> throughout all the vast Choire of the spirits of just men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and in a word, he hath <hi>all Power given him both in Heaven and Earth,</hi> and to his all-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Will the whole <hi>Creation</hi> is <hi>subjected.</hi> In this ever blessed <hi>King</hi> therefore by whom God now rules us, we have for the <hi>assurance</hi> of our hope of a future <hi>reward,</hi> the most <hi>stupendous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of it that ever was given to the World. And indeed, since the great <hi>end</hi> of Christs <hi>Mediation</hi> was to reduce men to their duty by giving them a <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>certain hope</hi> of the <hi>remission</hi> of their sins at present, and of a glorious <hi>reward</hi> hereafter, it was highly condecent that <hi>it self</hi> should be an Example of its own <hi>design,</hi> and that the <hi>glorious</hi> part of it should be made the reward of the more <hi>painful</hi> and <hi>difficult,</hi> that so having in the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> it self a signal instance of Gods immence liberality in <hi>rewarding</hi> obedience, we might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the more <hi>confidently</hi> expect that glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of <hi>Reward</hi> which God hath promised to those that obey him, and be thereby the more vigorously <hi>excited</hi> to our duty. And hence our Saviour proposes himself to us as an <hi>instance</hi> of the reward of obedience, <hi>To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me on my Throne, even as I have overcome and am sat down with my Father on his Throne:</hi> As much as if he should have said, that upon <hi>your overcoming</hi> the difficulties of <hi>your duty,</hi>
                  <pb n="590" facs="tcp:58668:309"/>
you shall receive a most glorious reward, you need not at all doubt, having so illustrious an Example of it in my <hi>self,</hi> who having conquer'd the <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult</hi> parts of my <hi>Mediation,</hi> which was to teach you as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and to expiate for you as a <hi>Priest,</hi> am now crowned with the reward of transacting the <hi>glorious</hi> part of it, i. e. <hi>sitting with my Father on his Throne,</hi> and there reigning with him in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Glory and Beatitude, and accordingly the Apostle bids us <hi>Look unto Iesus the Author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him indured the Cross, despised the shame, and is sate down on the right hand of the Throne of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty on high,</hi> Heb. 12.2.</p>

               <p>HAving in the foregoing Sections explain'd at large the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of the <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and men, all that now remains is to prove, that Jesus Christ, the Author of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is the <hi>Person</hi> whom God hath ordained and constituted this <hi>Mediator</hi> between him and us. And that he is so, he <hi>himself</hi> openly averr'd whilst he was upon Earth, and afterwards proclaimed it to the World by the Mouth of his <hi>Apostles</hi>; but this <hi>singly</hi> by it self is no argument at all of the
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:58668:309"/>
truth of the thing; because a <hi>deceiver</hi> might have aver'd the same thing, and since there were sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry <hi>pretenders</hi> to this Office as well as <hi>he,</hi> it was necessary there should be some <hi>other evidence</hi> of his being invested with it, besides his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; otherwise it would have been impossible for us to <hi>distinguish</hi> him from those that falsly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to it, and accordingly he himself tells us, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.31. <hi>If I bear witness of my self my witness is not true,</hi> i. e. If I can produce no other testimony of my being the Mediator than my own bare word, you have no reason at all to believe me; and therefore he tells us that he had not only <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Witness to it who was his <hi>forerunner,</hi> but also a much greater than <hi>Iohn</hi>'s even the Witness of his <hi>Father,</hi> ver. 32, 33. 36, 37. Now there are Three ways by which the Father <hi>Testified</hi> for him; all which do abundantly evince his being the <hi>true Mediator.</hi> First, by sundry ancient <hi>predictions</hi> of him which were all exactly accomplished in him, for <hi>the Testimony of Iesus,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iohn, is the spirit of Prophesie,</hi> Rev. 19.10. Secondly, by sundry <hi>Voices</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> by which the Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him his <hi>well-beloved Son.</hi> Thirdly, by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> which by the power of God he frequently wrought in his <hi>own Person,</hi> while he was upon Earth, and in the persons of his <hi>followers</hi> after his ascension into Heaven. To treat of all which would require a Volume by it self: and therefore for the <hi>first</hi> of these ways I shall refer the English Reader to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Kidders Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Messias,</hi> wherein the Testimony of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie</hi> is handled at large with very great strength and clearness of Judgment. And as for the <hi>second</hi>
                  <pb n="592" facs="tcp:58668:310"/>
way of Gods bearing Witness to Jesus, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Voices</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> I refer the Reader to our Learned D. <hi>Hammonds reasonableness of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion</hi> at the end of his <hi>Practical Catechism,</hi> it being my intent to insist only upon the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>last</hi> way, of Gods attesting Jesus to be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Miracles</hi>; for this way our Saviour himself most insists on and appeals to. So in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forecited <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.36. <hi>But I have a greater witness than that of</hi> John; <hi>for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of me that the Father hath sent me.</hi> So also <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.25. <hi>The works which I do in my Fathers Name, they bear witness of me</hi>; And in <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.24. Our Saviour makes the <hi>inexcusable aggravation</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> infidelity to be this, that they would not be convinced by all those <hi>miraculous</hi> works which he had done among them; <hi>If I had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin, but now have they both seen and hated me and my Father.</hi> In these and sundry other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces our Saviour appeals to those <hi>miraculous works</hi> which he did, as to a <hi>certain Testimony</hi> from God that he was the only <hi>true Messias</hi> or <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and men. And indeed, seeing the great <hi>aim</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of our Saviours <hi>Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is to advance the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi>; and seeing how admirably it is <hi>fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> and <hi>contrived</hi> to promote those blessed ends; <hi>Miracles</hi> are a most <hi>certain</hi> attestation of the truth of it. For though the Scripture tells us of <hi>false Miracles</hi> wrought by the power of evil Spirits, and History furnishes us with innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it; yet it is against all reason to imagin
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:58668:310"/>
that ever <hi>evil Spirits</hi> would exert their power to attest a Doctrine so infinitely <hi>repugnant</hi> to their own <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>interest.</hi> Had the <hi>design</hi> of our Saviours <hi>Mediation</hi> been to <hi>alienate</hi> mens minds from <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> we might have justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all his <hi>miraculous</hi> works to be nothing but <hi>Magical Tricks</hi> performed by confederacy with the Devil. For how could we have imagined either that <hi>God</hi> or any <hi>good Spirit</hi> would ever have employed his power to propagate a Doctrine so infinitely <hi>repugnant</hi> to his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi> seeing it is equally incredible either that a <hi>bad</hi> Religion should be the <hi>Will</hi> of a <hi>good</hi> God, or that the God of <hi>truth</hi> should bear false witness to a <hi>lie</hi>; and therefore we always find that those <hi>false Miracles</hi> effected by evil Spirits, whereof the Scripture and History make mention were always wrought to <hi>deprave</hi> mens minds with vicious principles, and to <hi>seduce</hi> men from God to superstition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, or to <hi>confirm</hi> them in it; but that an <hi>impious spirit</hi> should ever work <hi>Miracles</hi> to promote <hi>true Piety,</hi> to inspire mens minds with <hi>great</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> thoughts of <hi>God</hi> and sutable <hi>affections</hi> towards him, that a <hi>malicious, proud, unjust</hi> and <hi>revengeful</hi> Spirit should by miraculous Signs endeavour to reduce the World to the practice of <hi>Charity, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, justice, patience, meekness</hi> and <hi>equanimity</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely incredible; and therefore since the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Saviours <hi>Mediation</hi> doth above all the Religions that ever were professed in the World, most powerfully oblige us to <hi>these</hi> and all <hi>other</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> we may depend upon it, that though the Devil had known it to be a <hi>Lye,</hi> he would never have been so great a <hi>fool</hi> as
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:58668:311"/>
to cheat the World into the belief of it; for though he loves to <hi>deceive,</hi> yet there is nothing in nature he more hates than to <hi>deceive</hi> men into <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> because hereby he <hi>deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> and <hi>betrays</hi> his <hi>own</hi> interest in the World. The <hi>Miracles</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> therefore being all designed to attest a most <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, a Doctrine that is throughout exactly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable</hi> to the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and infinitely <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrent</hi> to the <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Devils</hi> must necessarily be the effects of a <hi>Divine</hi> power; because to work Miracles for the attestation of such a Doctrine could be neither agreeable to any <hi>other nature</hi> nor serviceable to any <hi>other interest</hi> but <hi>Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now of all the <hi>miraculous testimonies</hi> which God gave to our Saviour there is none to which he did so often appeal, and upon which he did so much stake the credit of his Doctrine, as that of his own <hi>Resurrection</hi> from the dead: for thus when he had performed that heroick act of Zeal, whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Money Changers out of the Temple, and the Jews required some <hi>sign</hi> of him, by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he did it, he bad them <hi>destroy this Temple,</hi> pointing to his own body, <hi>and in three days I will raise it up again,</hi> John 2.19. So also when the Pharisees desired him to give them some <hi>sign</hi> of his being the true Messias, he tells them, that <hi>no other sign should be given them but only the sign of the Prophet</hi> Jonas, <hi>for as</hi> Jonas <hi>was three days and three nights in the Whales belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth,</hi> which necessarily implies, that after that he should rise again, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.12. and accordingly we find that after he was risen and ascended, the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi>
                  <pb n="595" facs="tcp:58668:311"/>
business of his Apostles was to testifie his <hi>Resurrection</hi> to the World; for so <hi>Acts</hi> 1.22. S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> makes this to be the reason why it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that one should be chosen into the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolate, to supply the room of <hi>Iudas that he might be a witness with them of Christs Resurrection</hi>; and in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.33. we are told, <hi>that with great power the Apostles gave witness of the Resurrection of the Lord Iesus,</hi> and still when they were to prove any Article of the Christian Faith, <hi>this</hi> they urge as the <hi>great argument.</hi> Thus from the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ S. <hi>Paul</hi> proves the <hi>general Resurrection,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. so also <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. he proves that God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the World in righteousness <hi>by that man whom he hath ordained, viz.</hi> Christ Jesus, by this very topick, <hi>whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead</hi>; and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. that Apostle makes Christs <hi>Resurrection from the dead</hi> to be the great motive of credibility <hi>by which God had begotten them again into a lively hope</hi> of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happiness; so also <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith the same Apostle, <hi>i. e.</hi> because God had raised him from the dead, <hi>ver.</hi> 24.) <hi>let all the house of Israel know that God hath made this same Iesus both Lord and Christ</hi>; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. he is said to be <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Son of God by the Resurrection from the dead</hi>; yea, so <hi>undoubted</hi> an argument is this of Christs being the <hi>true Messias</hi> or <hi>Mediator,</hi> that the Jews themselves were convinced that they must either <hi>allow</hi> him to be so, or else <hi>outface</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> which put them upon all possible ways of stifling the report of it, knowing that if once it obtained credit in the World, <hi>the last error
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:58668:312"/>
would be worse than the first,</hi> Mat. 27.64. from all which it is evident, that it was taken for granted, not only by <hi>Christ</hi> himself and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> but even by his most avowed <hi>Enemies,</hi> that supposing his <hi>Resurrection</hi> to be true, it would from thence <hi>undeniably</hi> follow that he was the <hi>Messias</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the management of this Argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall endeavour these two things:</p>
               <p>First, To prove the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous attestation which God gave to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>raising</hi> him from the dead.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To shew what an <hi>excellent</hi> convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>argument</hi> this is of the <hi>Truth</hi> of his Doctrine or Mediation.</p>
               <p n="1">I. I shall endeavour to prove the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi> of this miraculous attestation, which God gave to our Saviour, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>raising</hi> him from the dead; which being a matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from all necessary causes, is capable of no other proof to those who were not Eye-witnesses of it but only that of <hi>Credible Testimony.</hi> Thus that <hi>Iulius Cesar</hi> was killed in the Senate-house is a matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> the truth of which is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all the World, and that man would be accounted little better than mad that should make the least doubt of it; and yet we have no other way of proving this, but only by the concurrent <hi>Testimony</hi> of credible <hi>Historians,</hi> which being as great an evidence as the matter is <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of, is as much as any <hi>reasonable</hi> man can require to induce him to <hi>believe</hi> it. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Testimony</hi> be the only evidence by which matters of <hi>Fact</hi> can be proved, yet it is such an
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:58668:312"/>
evidence as hath force enough in it to induce any <hi>reasonable</hi> man to <hi>believe</hi> its proposals, and there are ten thousand things which we do as firmly assent to upon the evidence of <hi>Testimony</hi> as to any propositions upon the evidence of <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Demonstration.</hi> If therefore the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our Saviour be but sufficiently attested, that is as good an Argument of the truth of it as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing will bear, and when it is made but as apparent that a thing <hi>is,</hi> as it could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be if it really <hi>were,</hi> there is no farther proof of it can be reasonably expected, and if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this men will not <hi>believe,</hi> it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any reason should <hi>convince</hi> them: but in <hi>this Testimony</hi> of our Saviours Resurrection there is as much <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>Credibility</hi> as there can be in <hi>any Testimony</hi> whatsoever. For to give a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony the <hi>utmost</hi> force of <hi>Credibility</hi> six things are required. First, That they that give it should be <hi>certainly informed</hi> of the truth of what they do attest. Secondly, That there should be a <hi>concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of a sufficient <hi>number</hi> of Witnesses. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That there should be no <hi>visible reason</hi> to <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> their <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>integrity.</hi> Fourthly, That there should be no <hi>apparent Motive</hi> to induce them to give <hi>false</hi> Witness. Fifthly, That they give some great <hi>security</hi> for the truth of what they say. And Sixthly, That they also produce some certain <hi>sign</hi> or <hi>token</hi> of the reality of their Testimony. And when all these circumstances do <hi>concur</hi> in a <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> they render it as <hi>highly credible</hi> as it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a <hi>Testimony</hi> to be. Now in that <hi>Testimony</hi> which we have of our Saviours <hi>Resurrection</hi> there was, as I shall shew in the particulars, a <hi>full concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of them all. For</p>
               <p n="1">

having any design to <hi>abuse</hi> the <hi>world.</hi> And that their outward <hi>sense</hi> was not <hi>imposed</hi> upon by the strength of their <hi>Imagination</hi> is evident in that he conversed with them forty days together, which was too long a time for their senses to mistake an <hi>image</hi> of their <hi>fancies</hi> for a <hi>reality.</hi> For how is it conceivable that so many persons as pretended to see him after his Resurrection, should for forty days together <hi>imagine</hi> that they <hi>saw</hi> him, <hi>heard</hi> him, <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drank</hi> with him, when in reality all this Scene of things was nothing but a <hi>dream</hi> or <hi>specter</hi> of their own <hi>fancies</hi>; that their <hi>fancies</hi> should create and represent a person to them frequently <hi>appearing</hi> to them preaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing them, giving out <hi>Commissions,</hi> and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring holy <hi>Ordinances</hi> to them; that their <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> should draw them out to the Mount of <hi>Olives</hi> after a <hi>Specter,</hi> that was visible no where but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage of their own <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and there represent it carried up into Heaven on a Cloud?

Another Circumstance requisite to render a Testimony highly <hi>credible</hi> is the <hi>concurrence</hi> of <hi>several Witnesses</hi>; of which we have a <hi>remarkable</hi> instance in this Testimony of our Saviours <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> For if to those five hundred Brethren and upwards, who, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, saw our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our after he was risen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. you add the <hi>Congregation</hi> of the Disciples he appeared to, when he baffled the Infidelity of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> together with those great <hi>Assemblies</hi> that saw him in the Mount of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and upon Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> from whence he ascended, it is not improbable but that there were some <hi>thousands</hi> of Persons that saw him after his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> among all whom we find the most exact <hi>agreement</hi> both in the matter and circumstances of what they did attest, which had it not been <hi>true,</hi> must have been morally <hi>impossible.</hi> For how could so <hi>vast</hi> a number of men have so <hi>punctually</hi> agreed in the same Story, had it been a <hi>lye?</hi> Especially, when they were so narrowly <hi>sifted,</hi> so craftily <hi>examined,</hi> and <hi>cross examined,</hi> as doubtless these men were (or at least would have been had there been any just ground to suspect them) by the Jewish <hi>Magistrates,</hi> who were all of them profest <hi>Enemies</hi> to our Saviour and his Doctrine. For had their Testimony been <hi>forged,</hi> it is not imaginable how they should <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see</hi> what <hi>Questions</hi> the Magistrates would propose to them, nor consequently how they should <hi>agree</hi> what <hi>Answers</hi> to return to their several Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories; so that when they came to be examined they must of necessity have <hi>thwarted</hi> and <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted</hi> one another, at least in some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time or place, or the like, by which means

the whole forgery must have soon been unravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the credit of it for ever dasht out of countenance.

put to death by the Magistrates, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he was buried, and his Sepulchre dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up with a huge Stone, and a guard of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers set to watch it, left his Proselytes should steal him away, yet the <hi>Sunday</hi> following he arose, and hath since been seen by several hundreds, if not some thousands of the neighbourhood, many of whom had touched and handled him, eat, and drank, and conversed familiarly with him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom there was <hi>Peter</hi> such a one, <hi>Thomas</hi> such a one, and <hi>Iohn</hi> such a one, naming some twenty or thirty persons well known among the neighbours, who could give a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the matter, and tell the names of most of the persons that were eye-witnesses with them; why now it cannot be supposed but that as soon as ever this formal rumour began to spread (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it found credit among the multitude, and the pretended witnesses of it should be so bold as to go and assert it before the King and Council, as the Apostles did before the Rulers of the Jews) I say, it cannot be supposed but that care would be taken that the matter should be immediately sifted, and the several neighbouring Justices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to call these Witnesses to account, who by pumping and examining, promising and threatning them could not fail of extorting the truth from them in a very little while. For it is impossible but they must have found them falter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the relation of their Story, and counter-witnessing one another. <hi>Iohn</hi> would have told it with this Circumstance, and <hi>Peter</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and <hi>Thomas</hi> would have thwarted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted them both, so that when they came to
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:58668:317"/>
compare their several relations with one another, in all probability they would have found as great a <hi>confusion</hi> among them as there was in the language of the Bricklayers of <hi>Babel.</hi> And therefore though at first perhaps the Story might have seemed <hi>plausible,</hi> and a great many <hi>credulous</hi> people might have believed it, yet every day would have rendered it more suspicious, and the <hi>truth</hi> must at last have <hi>triumphed</hi> and <hi>prevailed</hi>; but yet though the <hi>Eye-witnesses</hi> of our Saviours <hi>Resurrection</hi> were thus <hi>sifted</hi> and <hi>examined</hi> over and over, their relation every one day got ground and <hi>credit</hi> even in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it self, where the thing was <hi>transacted,</hi> and where every one might easily <hi>inform himself</hi> concerning the credit of the <hi>Relaters,</hi> and the circumstances of their <hi>relation</hi>; insomuch that forty days after it was so far from being <hi>dashed</hi> out of countenance, that at <hi>one</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of S. <hi>Peters</hi> there were no less than <hi>three thousand</hi> persons converted to the belief of it, and so it still grew and increased, till at last in despite of all the <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> of its opposers, it was imbraced and acknowledged throughout all the World; which is an undeniable evidence of the <hi>exact agreement</hi> there was in the testimony of the several <hi>Witnesses</hi> of our Saviours <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Another Circumstance requisite to render a <hi>Testimony</hi> highly <hi>credible</hi> is, when there is no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible reason to suspect the <hi>honesty</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> of the Attestors; which circumstance did also concur to credit the <hi>Testimony</hi> of our Saviours <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</hi> For that the first testifiers of it were men of a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>unsuspected</hi> honesty, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any man that seriously considers either the
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:58668:318"/>
                  <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they taught, or the <hi>Genius</hi> of their <hi>followers,</hi> or the <hi>manner</hi> of their <hi>testimony,</hi> or the <hi>success</hi> it had among those who were best able to satisfie themselves whether they were honest or no. First, as for their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> there is nothing can be more <hi>contrary</hi> to lying, dissembling and Hypocritical reservation, it strictly requires <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>simplicity</hi> of speech, and that our <hi>words</hi> should be the Images and Interpreters of our <hi>minds,</hi> it brands and stigmatizes all <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>falshood</hi> with a most <hi>infamous</hi> Character, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocably consigns all wilful <hi>Lyars</hi> to the <hi>misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> portion of the Father of Lies. If then they believed their <hi>own Doctrine,</hi> it is not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned they would ever have defended it with <hi>frauds</hi> and <hi>impostures</hi>; and whether they believed it or no, it is hardly supposable, that they would have so loudly declaimed against <hi>dishonesty,</hi> had they been at least visibly <hi>dishonest themselves,</hi> since by condemning it in <hi>others</hi> they must have libelled <hi>themselves,</hi> and imblazoned to the World their <hi>own</hi> shame and infamy. And then secondly, As for the <hi>genius</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> of their disciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, it's plain that there never was any thing more <hi>open</hi> and <hi>sincere:</hi> for such was the <hi>ingenuous simplicity</hi> of the Primitive Christians, that they thought it a disparagement to be put to their Oaths, thinking it sufficient for every good man to give this assurance of his truth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I speak truly</hi>; and when they were most <hi>severely</hi> examined by their bloudy persecutors concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their faith, they never either <hi>denied</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed</hi> it, counting it a most <hi>impious</hi> thing to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble</hi> the truth, and though when they were
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:58668:318"/>
questioned they could easily have either <hi>denied</hi> or <hi>evaded</hi> it, yet they <hi>scorned</hi> to live upon such <hi>base terms,</hi> to be beholden to their <hi>hypocrisie</hi> for their <hi>lives</hi>; yea so conspicuous was their <hi>Honesty</hi> to all the World that the <hi>Heathen</hi> themselves were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to <hi>acknowledge</hi> it. For so <hi>Pliny</hi> in the account which he gave the Emperor <hi>Trajan</hi> of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, tells him, That after the <hi>strictest</hi> enquiry he could make of them, even of those who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Christianity, he found this to be the greatest fault they were guilty of, that they used harmlesly to meet to worship Christ, and at those meetings to bind themselves by a <hi>Sacrament</hi> that they would not do any <hi>wickedness,</hi> that they would not <hi>steal,</hi> nor <hi>Rob,</hi> nor commit <hi>Adultery,</hi> ner <hi>falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy</hi> their words, nor <hi>with-hold</hi> any thing wherewith they had been <hi>intrusted,</hi> where ever it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at their hands. Such was the temper of the <hi>immediate Disciples</hi> of the <hi>Eye-witnesses</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours <hi>Resurrection</hi>; and is it likely that the <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> would have proved so honest had they not been taught by the Example as well as by the Doctrine of their <hi>Masters:</hi> For to be sure had the <hi>Apostles</hi> been dishonest, their immediate Disciples must needs have <hi>known</hi> something of it, and being acquainted with it, they would doubtless have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved either not to <hi>continue</hi> their <hi>disciples,</hi> any longer, or else to have <hi>imitated</hi> them in all their secret Cheats and Knaveries; and so from the <hi>Masters</hi> to the <hi>Disciples</hi> dishonesty would have been propagated from one generation to another; but since the contrary happened, it's plain that the first <hi>Propagators</hi> were men of very <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> minds; which will yet further appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:58668:319"/>
thirdly the <hi>manner</hi> of their <hi>Testimony,</hi> which they delivered with the greatest <hi>plainness</hi> and <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi> of speech, the greatest <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>assurance</hi> of Spirit, and the greatest <hi>particularity,</hi> as to all its circumstances; they never went about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve their sense in <hi>ambiguous</hi> words, or to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the World in a <hi>pompous</hi> stile, in <hi>pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> flourishes or <hi>flattering</hi> insinuations, which is the way of all <hi>Impostors</hi>; but as men that were well assured of the <hi>truth</hi> of what they said, they exposed it to the World in the most <hi>naked</hi> and <hi>simple</hi> expressions, and so left it to recommend it self; they did not whisper their Testimony in <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> as if they were either affraid or ashamed to produce it in the <hi>open light</hi>; but with the greatest confidence and assurance they published it in the <hi>midst</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> yea and before the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> it self; where, if it had been false, 'twas impossible but it should be <hi>detected</hi>; and whereas 'tis the way of Impostors to reserve themselves in <hi>generals,</hi> knowing that should they descend to <hi>particulars,</hi> 'twould be hard for them to avoid <hi>discovery</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction</hi>; the Apostles did not only report a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> story of Christs Resurrection, but related it with all its most <hi>minute</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> circumstances, nor did they <hi>Change</hi> or <hi>alter</hi> any one of them upon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>examinations</hi> before different Examiners; but still persisted with the greatest <hi>constancy</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and <hi>harmony</hi> with each other; so that if ever there might be any thing gathered of the <hi>temper</hi> of persons from the particular manner of their <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses,</hi> we may certainly discern the greatest <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in the Apostles in the <hi>manner</hi> of their expressing themselves to the World. But then in the fourth and
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:58668:319"/>
last place, the <hi>credit</hi> which they found among those who were the best able to satisfie themselves whether they were honest or no, is a further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their <hi>fidelity</hi>; for had they been men of <hi>known honesty,</hi> it is not to be imagined that they could ever have obtained so much <hi>credit</hi> in a place where they were so intimately <hi>known,</hi> and among persons with whom they every day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with the greatest <hi>openness</hi> and <hi>freedom,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering how <hi>contrary</hi> their Testimony was to the <hi>genius</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> of those who gave credit to them, many of whose hands had been imbrewed in the blood of our Saviour, by which they were obliged in their own <hi>vindication,</hi> so far as in them lay, to disprove the story of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; because if that proved true, it proved them guilty of the most monstrous <hi>impiety</hi> that ever was acted, <hi>viz.</hi> the murder of the Son of God. And is it likely that the <hi>Murderers</hi> of our Saviour would ever have believed the story of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> which was so clear an evidence of <hi>his innocency</hi> and <hi>their own guilt,</hi> had they had any reason to <hi>suspect</hi> the <hi>veracity</hi> of those that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested it, and yet in <hi>despite</hi> of themselves great numbers of them were <hi>forced</hi> to believe it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as soon as they did so, they were <hi>pricked at the heart</hi> with the sense of their horrid impiety, and <hi>forced</hi> to cry out in a bitter Agony of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, <hi>Men and Brethren what shall we do to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> and as for those of them who had <hi>no</hi> hand in his murder, to be sure they were greatly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against the belief of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> because upon that depended the truth of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which plainly contradicted a great part of that
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:58668:320"/>
                  <hi>Religion</hi> in which they had been <hi>educated,</hi> and of which they were infinitly <hi>zealous,</hi> and therefore to be sure they would never have given credit to it, had they not had <hi>undeniable evidence</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> of those that testified it; especially when it was so easie for them to satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about it. For 'tis not imaginable they would ever have entertained so <hi>ungrateful</hi> a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but upon the most <hi>strict</hi> enquiry into the <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> of its relators; and if upon enquiry they had found the least flaw either in <hi>them</hi> or in their <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,</hi> if they could have convicted them of any <hi>dishonest practices</hi> for the time <hi>past,</hi> or catched them tripping or contradicting one another in what they testified at <hi>present,</hi> they would soon have made the World ring of it, and the <hi>Iews</hi> who were dispersed through all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, would have divulged to all the World their <hi>fraudulent practices,</hi> and posted them up where ever they came for infamous <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Lyars</hi>; which must have infallibly <hi>blasted</hi> the <hi>credit</hi> of their testimony, and caused it to have been hissed out of the World for a fulsom <hi>Imposture.</hi> Wherefore since no such thing ever happened, but contrariwise the <hi>credit</hi> of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Christs Resurrection did, in <hi>despite</hi> of all the <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> of its opposers, every day <hi>spread</hi> and <hi>increase</hi> even in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it self, where the thing was <hi>acted,</hi> and where the reporters of it <hi>lived,</hi> and that not only for a few days or months, but from <hi>year</hi> to <hi>year,</hi> even till <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it self was destroyed; since, I say, all this is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, what greater argument can we desire of the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> of those that attested it.
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:58668:320"/>
And supposing them to be <hi>honest,</hi> their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny must be <hi>true,</hi> because it was not matter of <hi>opinion,</hi> in which it is possible for the wisest men to be mistaken, but matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> of which they had certain information from their own <hi>senses,</hi> and he who says that he <hi>saw</hi> such a thing, and it's evident that his senses were not <hi>imposed</hi> on, lies against his own <hi>conscience,</hi> if it be not true that he saw it.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Another Circumstance requisite to render a <hi>Testimony</hi> highly <hi>credible,</hi> is, that there is no <hi>apparent motive</hi> to induce the Attestors of it to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie falsly. For whether they are honest or no, we cannot well suppose that in a matter of importance they will testifie <hi>falsly,</hi> without some great <hi>motive</hi> inducing them thereunto: but as for the <hi>witnesses</hi> of our Saviours <hi>Resurrection,</hi> had they not been <hi>certain</hi> of the truth of it, they could have <hi>no</hi> imaginable <hi>motive</hi> to induce them to attest it; for they could never hope to reap the least <hi>advantage</hi> from it either here or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; not <hi>here,</hi> for their Lord had told them beforehand, <hi>that if they would be his Disciples, they must suffer persecution</hi>; and they themselves could not but foresee that by testifying his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> they must infallibly alarm all the World against them, because the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they confirmed by it was extremely opposite both to the present <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and to the common <hi>Theology</hi> of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>; and that therefore by going about to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish <hi>it,</hi> they must in effect proclaim War against all the World, and consequently expose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the utmost <hi>Rigor</hi> and <hi>Severity</hi> that the
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:58668:321"/>
wit and malice of men could invent or inflict: which must be a very <hi>sorry motive</hi> sure to induce men in their wits to undertake the propagation of a <hi>known Imposture.</hi> But perhaps it may be thought they did all this for the <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of being the <hi>founders</hi> of a new <hi>Sect.</hi> But from whence, I beseech you, could they promise themselves <hi>success?</hi> not from their Master <hi>Iesus,</hi> who, if their testimony was not <hi>true,</hi> they could not but know was still detained under the power of the <hi>grave</hi>; not from <hi>God,</hi> whom if they testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied falsly, they were conscious they wickedly <hi>belyed</hi> in suborning his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>veracity</hi> to bear witness to a <hi>falshood</hi>; not from the force and charms of their own <hi>Eloquence</hi> or <hi>Sophistry,</hi> for that they pretended not to; not from their <hi>Riches,</hi> for their Staves and Scrips were all the Treasure they carried with them; nor from any <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> they had or ever were like to have; for how could such poor illiterate persons as they, ever expect to arrive to an Authority great enough to contest with all the power and wisdom of the World which was armed against them; in a word, not from any <hi>proneness</hi> they found either in <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> to imbrace the Doctrine which they designed by this their <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> to confirm and assert, that being every where <hi>gainsaid</hi> and <hi>opposed</hi> by the interests and affections of both; and if their Testimony was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved (as 'twas very unlikely it should, if it had not been <hi>true</hi>) what could they expect but to be branded to all posterity as a company of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cheats and Impostors: So that unless they had been assured that their testimony was <hi>true,</hi>
                  <pb n="611" facs="tcp:58668:321"/>
they had all the reason in the World to expect that it would prove the most <hi>fatal</hi> and <hi>unprofitable Lye</hi> that ever was invented or broached among mankind; since it was so far from promising them any worldly <hi>advantage,</hi> that it visibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed them to all the <hi>miseries</hi> and <hi>calamities</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life. And then if they knew this Story of Christs <hi>Resurrection</hi> which they attested to be a <hi>Lye,</hi> they had a great deal less reason to expect any <hi>advantage</hi> from it in the World <hi>to come</hi>; for either they <hi>believed</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> which they sought to confirm by attesting this sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or they did <hi>not</hi>; if they did <hi>not,</hi> how could they hope to fare ever the <hi>better</hi> in the <hi>other</hi> World for endeavouring to propagate a false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in <hi>this</hi>; if they <hi>did,</hi> how would they hope to be made happy hereafter by telling a <hi>Lye</hi> for that <hi>Religion</hi> which excommunicates <hi>Lyars</hi> out of the Kingdom of Happiness? Since therefore if their <hi>testimony</hi> had been <hi>false,</hi> they could expect to reap no advantage from it in either World, doubtless they would never have been so mad as to assert and attest it, had they not known it to be <hi>true</hi>; for what man in his wits would ever tell a <hi>lye</hi> that hath no reason to expect any other fruit from it, but only to <hi>die</hi> for it here, and to be <hi>damned</hi> for it hereafter?</p>
               <p n="5">V. Another Circumstance requisite to render a <hi>Testimony</hi> highly <hi>credible</hi> is, that the testifiers of it do give some great <hi>security</hi> for the truth of what they say; and therefore it is required by human Laws that in all great matters of Fact the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> should give the security of their <hi>Oaths,</hi> or of some great <hi>pledge</hi> to be forfeited by them, in

case their Testimony prove <hi>false.</hi> But never did any men give <hi>greater security</hi> of their truth, than the <hi>Witnesses</hi> of our Saviours <hi>Resurrection</hi>; for they sealed their Testimony with their <hi>Blood,</hi> and rather chose to undergo the most witty and exquisite <hi>torments,</hi> than to <hi>recant</hi> any part or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of what they had seen and testified concerning it. For of all the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who were the chief <hi>Witnesses</hi> of it, there was only one that esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a <hi>violent</hi> death, and he, as the Ecclesiastical Story tells us, had not been delivered from it but by a Miracle. And doubtless those other <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> who saw and conversed with our Saviour after he was risen, and together with the <hi>Apostles</hi> bore witness of it to the World, did proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably run the same fate: And how is it imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that so many men should all turn so mad together as to lay down their <hi>lives</hi> for a pledge of the <hi>truth</hi> of a Story which they knew to be all a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the defence of S. <hi>George</hi>'s killing the Dragon, would not all the World have concluded them incurably <hi>distracted?</hi> But as for the <hi>Apostles,</hi> their excellent <hi>Writings</hi> are a sufficient demonstration, that they were men of very <hi>sound intellectuals,</hi> and therefore tho we should suppose them to be so <hi>wicked</hi> as to love lying for its <hi>own</hi> sake, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not suppose them to be so <hi>mad</hi> as to love it better than their own <hi>lives,</hi> as they must necessarily do, if their <hi>Testimony</hi> of our Saviours Resurrection were <hi>false.</hi> But supposing that one or two of them should have proved so <hi>frantick,</hi> yet it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible that so many <hi>hundreds</hi> of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should all <hi>agree</hi> together at the same time in the same <hi>mad project, viz.</hi> to throw away their <hi>lives</hi> for no other purpose but only to <hi>cheat</hi> and <hi>abuse</hi> the World, and that no <hi>one</hi> of them should be induced, by all the <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> that were set before them, to <hi>confess</hi> and <hi>discover</hi> the mad conspiracy. When they began to report the Story, they could not but foresee the <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that they must either <hi>recant</hi> it, and thereby proclaim themselves <hi>Impostors</hi> to the World, or else lay down their <hi>lives</hi> for it. So that had they known it to be <hi>false,</hi> it would have been a Prodigy of <hi>Impudence</hi> in them, and <hi>Folly</hi> together, not only without hope of <hi>benefit,</hi> but within prospect of a certain <hi>ruin,</hi> to have divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a <hi>known lye</hi> to the World, and under the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest</hi> Persecutions to have persisted in it without the least regret of <hi>Conscience,</hi> or concernment for their own <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>safety.</hi> There never was the like instance among men, and I dare say there never will be so long as men love themselves,
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:58668:323"/>
and continue in their Wits; and to imagine <hi>that</hi> of the Witnesses of our Saviours Resurrection, of which there is no parallel <hi>example</hi> among mankind, is an Argument that we have much more <hi>inclination</hi> than <hi>reason</hi> to be Infidels. This therefore is plain, that the <hi>Witnesses</hi> of Christs <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> gave as great a <hi>pledge</hi> of the truth of their <hi>Testimony,</hi> as it was possible for mortal men to do, and if those men may not be believed who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test a thing upon certain <hi>knowledge,</hi> and seal it with their <hi>blood,</hi> there is no credit can be given to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>human Testimony</hi>; because a mans <hi>life</hi> is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>security</hi> that he can possibly give for his <hi>honesty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. Another Circumstance requisite to render a <hi>Testimony</hi> highly <hi>credible</hi> is, that the <hi>Witnesses</hi> do give some certain <hi>sign</hi> and <hi>token</hi> that what they testifie is <hi>true</hi>; and this the <hi>Eye-witnesses</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours <hi>Resurrection</hi> did. For in token that what they said was true they themselves wrought sundry <hi>Miracles</hi> in his name: for so we read of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, that <hi>they went forth and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the Word with signs following,</hi> Mar. 16.20. and that <hi>with great power,</hi> i. e. miraculous works, <hi>the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles gave witness of the Resurrection of the Lord Iesus, Acts</hi> 4.33. and also at <hi>Iconium the Lord gave Testimony to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands, Acts</hi> 14.3. And the same was done by S. <hi>Stephen</hi> at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, Acts</hi> 6.8. and by S. <hi>Philip</hi> at <hi>Samaria, Acts</hi> 8.6, 7. and by S. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ephesus, Acts</hi> 19.11. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us, <hi>That from Ierusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, the Gospel had been preached by him, with mighty signs and wonders, and
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:58668:323"/>
by the power of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. 15.19. all which things being recorded in an <hi>Age</hi> wherein, if they had been <hi>false,</hi> they might easily have been <hi>disproved,</hi> it had been the wildest project in the world for the <hi>Apostles</hi> to have <hi>pretended</hi> to them had they not been notoriously <hi>true</hi>; for they must needs think that all the World being <hi>preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced</hi> against them would be sure to keep a very <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>watchful</hi> eye on them, and that if upon the severest enquiry they were at any time taken tripping in this their pretence of working <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> their fraud will soon ring through all the World, which must unavoidably <hi>prejudice</hi> their Cause a thousand times more than all the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> they pretended to could <hi>advance</hi> it; and for men that had the eyes of all the World upon them falsly to pretend to work such innumerable <hi>Miracles</hi> as they did, and this not in corners, but in <hi>publick</hi> view, and to name the places where they wrought them, and where they knew there were thousands that could and would certainly <hi>detect</hi> and <hi>disprove</hi> them, would have been the most prodigious instance of <hi>impudence</hi> and <hi>folly</hi> together that ever was acted by men in their Wits. But so notoriously <hi>true</hi> was the matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> that their most inveterate <hi>Enemies</hi> amongst both Jews and Gentiles have not the confidence to <hi>deny</hi> it, although indeed they attributed it, even as the Jews did our Saviours Miracles, to the power of <hi>Magick</hi>; for so in their <hi>Talmud, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat. de Idol. c.</hi> 1. the Jews celebrate S. <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle as eminent for the gift of Miracles, by whom the Nephew of <hi>Rab. Samuel</hi> being bit of a Serpent would not be cured because every Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:58668:324"/>
of Jesus was wont to heal in his name. And <hi>Lib. Sabbat. Ierosol.</hi> they tell us of a Son of <hi>Rab. Iose,</hi> who having swallowed Poyson was cured by a Christian in the name of Jesus. And as for the Heathen <hi>Iulian</hi> himself, he confesses that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did very wonderful things, for he says, that he was the greatest and most expert <hi>Magician</hi> that ever was, <hi>vid. Cyril. Alex. lib.</hi> 3. and the same he pronounces of S. <hi>Peter</hi> also, <hi>id. lib.</hi> 9. So also <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> frequently charges the Christians with doing their mighty works by the power of some <hi>Demon,</hi> adding a fiction of his own, <hi>viz.</hi> that they had received from Christ certain Magical Books by which they were instructed to perform all their Miracles, <hi>vid. Origen. cont. Cels. p.</hi> 302. and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other places, which is a plain confession that such <hi>Miracles</hi> were commonly <hi>performed</hi> by Christians: But that they did <hi>not</hi> perform them by any confederacy with <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> as these bad men affirm, is evident because one of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most common Miracles was <hi>dispossessing</hi> these evil Spirits of mens <hi>Bodies,</hi> and their own <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Oracles.</hi> For the truth of which they often provoke their Adversaries in their Writings and Apologies to come and make experiment of it. Thus S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Demetrian</hi> Proconsul of <hi>Africa, O that thou wouldst but hear and see when the Devils whom thou worshipest are adjured and tortured by us, and with the spiritual Rods and Torments of our Words are ejected out of the Bodies they possess, when howling and roaring in a human voice they confess the Iudgment to come: Do but come and see whether these things we say are not true.</hi> And a little after, <hi>If thou wilt come,</hi>
                  <pb n="617" facs="tcp:58668:324"/>
saith he, <hi>thou shalt see those whom thou worshipest for Gods stand bound and tremble as miserable Captives under our hands.</hi> Others of them appeal to the Consciences of the Heathens themselves, who had been <hi>Spectators</hi> of their <hi>miraculous Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> over these infernal Spirits. So <hi>Minutius Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix, All these things are very well known to a great many of your selves, that your Gods are forced by us to confess themselves Devils, when by the torment of our words, and by the fire of our Prayers they are chased out of human Bodies, even</hi> Saturn <hi>and</hi> Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis, <hi>and</hi> Jupiter, <hi>and the greatest of those Gods you worship, being overcome with sorrow are forced to acknowledge what they are, and tho it be to their shame, especially when you are present, yet they dare not lye, but being adjured by the true and only God they quake and tremble in the bodies they possess, and either leap out immediately, or vanish by degrees.</hi> Others of them offer to make the <hi>experiment</hi> even before the Tribunals of the Heathen, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for the success with their own lives. So <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologetick. <hi>Let any man that is apparently acted by one of your Gods be brought before your own Tribunals, and if that supposed God, being commanded by any Christian to speak, doth not confess himself to be a Devil, as not daring to lye to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, take that malepert Christian and pour out his blood immediately. Yea, how often,</hi> saith he a little after, <hi>only upon our touch of and breathing upon pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed persons are these Gods you adore forced to depart out of their Bodies with grief and reluctancy, you your selves being present, and blushing at it.</hi> And these things, as <hi>Origen</hi> tells us, <hi>cont. Cels. lib.</hi> 7. were ordinarily performed even by the <hi>meanest
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:58668:325"/>
Christians,</hi> which is a plain Argument that it was done merely by the power of Jesus, without any <hi>Conjuration</hi> or <hi>Magical</hi> Art. And can we imagine that the <hi>Devil,</hi> without any constraint from some superior power would ever have <hi>quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> that Tyranny he had so <hi>long</hi> exercised over the <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>consciences</hi> of men, who had thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto <hi>adored</hi> and <hi>worshiped</hi> him, or that he would ever have <hi>confessed</hi> himself to be a <hi>Devil</hi> to those men who sought the <hi>ruin</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and made use of his Confessions to that purpose, had he not been <hi>forced</hi> to it by the Authority of the <hi>Father</hi> of Spirits? Is it likely, he would have exerted his power to the <hi>ruin</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> interest, and the <hi>amendment</hi> of those Souls he had <hi>insna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> and <hi>captivated,</hi> as he must necessarily have done should he have <hi>impowered</hi> the Witnesses of our Saviours <hi>Resurrection</hi> to confirm their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony by <hi>Miracles?</hi> And since they all along de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they did them in the <hi>name</hi> and by the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> to be sure if it had not been <hi>so,</hi> the God of <hi>truth</hi> would never have <hi>impowered</hi> them to impose such a cheat upon the World. These Miracles of theirs therefore were <hi>plain signs</hi> and <hi>tokens</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of what they did attest, <hi>viz.</hi> that Jesus was risen from the dead, and that not only as they were so many divine <hi>seals</hi> by which God himself did <hi>confirm</hi> their Testimony, whose <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>veracity</hi> could never have permitted him to set the <hi>seal</hi> of his <hi>miraculous power</hi> to a <hi>lye:</hi> But besides this the Apostles Miracles were so many plain <hi>demonstrations</hi> that Jesus was <hi>risen</hi> and <hi>alive,</hi> since they did them all in <hi>his name,</hi> and by <hi>his power.</hi> For how is it possible, that Jesus
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:58668:325"/>
could have <hi>impowered</hi> them to do <hi>Miracles</hi> had he been still among the <hi>dead,</hi> and in a state of <hi>inacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity?</hi> A <hi>dead</hi> man can do nothing <hi>himself,</hi> much less can he impower <hi>others</hi> to do Miracles. So that by those <hi>miraculous Works</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did by the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> they did in effect thus bespeak the World: Look here, O incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous World, if nothing else will persuade you that our Lord is <hi>risen</hi> and <hi>alive,</hi> behold the <hi>vital operations</hi> which he exerts in us his Disciples, tho of our selves we are as impotent as you, yet no sooner do we invoke our great <hi>Masters Name,</hi> and implore <hi>his Aid,</hi> but we are presently <hi>enabled</hi> to perform mighty things beyond the power of any <hi>mortal</hi> Agent; without any other Charm but his <hi>powerful Name,</hi> we raise the <hi>Dead,</hi> bind the <hi>Devils,</hi> restore the <hi>Blind,</hi> recover the <hi>Lame,</hi> and cure all manner of <hi>Diseases</hi>; and is not this as <hi>plain</hi> a token of his being <hi>alive,</hi> as if he were now standing before you in our room, and doing all these things in his <hi>own Person?</hi> If he were <hi>dead</hi> still he could not <hi>act</hi> in us, as you see him do; and therefore if nothing else will convince ye that he is <hi>alive</hi> again, behold these mighty <hi>powers</hi> which <hi>he</hi> exerts in <hi>us,</hi> and be at length persuaded by these <hi>sensible</hi> tokens of his <hi>activity,</hi> which we produce before your eyes, that he is <hi>risen</hi> from the <hi>dead.</hi> For it is worth observing, that this gift of <hi>Miracles</hi> was never so plentifully <hi>communicated</hi> to the Apostles as <hi>after</hi> Christs <hi>Ascension</hi> into Heaven, for before he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended he commanded them to <hi>tarry at Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem till they had received the Gift of the Holy Ghost,</hi> or, which is the same thing, the Gift of
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:58668:326"/>
Miracles, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4, 5. and this gift, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tells them, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. was to enable them <hi>to bear Testimony to him unto all the World,</hi> for he being now ascended into Heaven they could no longer produce his <hi>person</hi> to convince unbelievers of the truth of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and therefore to <hi>supply</hi> this defect Christ gave them the gift of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> that that might be instead of his bodily <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> token of his being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to <hi>life</hi> again. And indeed this was as <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> a <hi>sign</hi> of it as if he had continued upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and openly <hi>conversed</hi> among <hi>men</hi> in the view of the World; for the most <hi>crrtain</hi> sign of <hi>life</hi> is <hi>action,</hi> and by what hath been said it is apparent, that Christ did not more <hi>visibly</hi> act in his <hi>own Person</hi> when he was upon Earth, than he did in the persons of his <hi>Apostles</hi> after he ascended into Heaven. These <hi>miraculous Operations</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which they performed by the Power of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, were all of them so many <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>sensible Signs</hi> and <hi>Tokens</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of what they did attest, <hi>viz.</hi> that Jesus was <hi>risen</hi> from the dead. So that considering all these <hi>circumstances</hi> of the Apostles <hi>Testimony,</hi> I dare boldly affirm, that from the beginning of the World to this day there never was any matter of <hi>Fact</hi> more <hi>sufficiently</hi> and <hi>credibly</hi> testified than this of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our Saviour; and by raising <hi>him</hi> from the dead God hath bore <hi>witness</hi> to him before all the World, that he really is what he <hi>pretended</hi> to be, the <hi>true</hi> Messias and <hi>only</hi> Mediator between himself and us.</p>
               <p>Which brings me to the second Head I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to shew what an excellent <hi>convincing</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:58668:326"/>
this is of the <hi>truth</hi> of our Saviours <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Mediation,</hi> and how effectually it justifies his <hi>pretence</hi> of being the <hi>true</hi> Messias and <hi>only</hi> Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. 'Tis true, all the <hi>Miracles</hi> which our Saviour wrought while he was upon Earth, were plain <hi>demonstrations</hi> of his being <hi>sent</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> and therefore to these, as I shewed before, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>appeals</hi> in his excellent Disputations with the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi>; and when <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> sent to inquire of him whether he were the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias or no, he returns no other Answer but this, <hi>Go and shew</hi> John <hi>those things which ye see and hear, that the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the Lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have the Gospel preached unto them,</hi> Matt. 11.4, 5. But his own <hi>Resurrection</hi> being the <hi>greatest Miracle</hi> that he ever performed, to this both <hi>himself</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> did most commonly <hi>appeal</hi>; insomuch that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.14. says, <hi>That if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and our faith vain</hi>; because <hi>this</hi> being the <hi>Grand Miracle</hi> on which Christ staked the <hi>credit</hi> of his whole <hi>Doctrine</hi>; if this had <hi>failed,</hi> there had been no reason to give any <hi>Credit</hi> to any thing that he taught. The <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ therefore is a certain <hi>evidence</hi> of the truth of his <hi>Doctrine</hi>; only as it was the <hi>greatest</hi> of his miraculous works, it proved his Doctrine no otherwise than his <hi>other</hi> Miracles did; but it was the <hi>highest proof</hi> of it, as it was the <hi>greatest</hi> of his Miracles. Wherefore to shew what an <hi>excellent</hi> proof of his Doctrine his <hi>Resurrection</hi> was, I shall endeavour to shew that <hi>Miracles</hi> in general, and particularly
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:58668:327"/>
                  <hi>this</hi> of Christs <hi>Resurrection</hi> are the <hi>best evidences</hi> of a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> that the nature of the thing will bear, and this I shall do by shewing</p>
               <p>First, that this is the most <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> Evidence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it is the most <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that it is the <hi>plainest</hi> and most <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, That it is the <hi>shortest</hi> and most <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. First, That this evidence of <hi>Miracles</hi> is the most <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> to prove the <hi>truth</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretence to <hi>Revelation.</hi> For as for the <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> Arguments drawn from the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> they may prove it indeed to be <hi>wise,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> but how they should prove it to be immediately <hi>revealed</hi> from <hi>God</hi> I cannot apprehend. For as for the Moral Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the <hi>Heathen Philosophers</hi> they were most of them very <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>holy</hi>; but yet it doth not hence follow that the Authors of them were immediately <hi>inspired</hi> when they wrote them: notwithstanding their <hi>goodness</hi> they might be, and doubtless were the dictates of their own <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reason,</hi> and so may any <hi>other</hi> Doctrine how <hi>good</hi> soever it be; and tho the <hi>Authors</hi> of such Writings may <hi>pretend</hi> to be <hi>inspired,</hi> yet that is no argument that they <hi>are.</hi> For all that I know they may <hi>pretend</hi> to it to give <hi>credit</hi> to their <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> or they may <hi>think</hi> themselves <hi>inspired</hi> when they are <hi>not</hi>; so that they have no <hi>other</hi> way to convince me that what they <hi>pretend</hi> is <hi>true,</hi> but only by giving me some certain <hi>sign</hi> and <hi>token</hi>
                  <pb n="623" facs="tcp:58668:327"/>
that they are <hi>really</hi> inspired from above, and no <hi>sign</hi> can reasonably convince me of this, but such a one as I have reason to believe <hi>God</hi> alone did <hi>inable</hi> them to give me; for so long as I have just reason to suspect that the sign which they give me was produced either by their <hi>own power</hi> or by the power of some <hi>other</hi> Agent besides <hi>God,</hi> it is no <hi>sign</hi> at all to me of their being <hi>inspired</hi> by God. <hi>Miracles</hi> therefore being the <hi>only signs</hi> we can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably believe are produced by the immediate <hi>power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> 'tis <hi>they</hi> alone can indicate a mans being immediately <hi>inspired</hi> by <hi>God.</hi> For how can I be assured that what a man saith is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>revealed</hi> to him by <hi>God,</hi> unless <hi>God</hi> himself give me some <hi>sign</hi> or <hi>token</hi> that he is so, and how can I know that <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> is a <hi>sign</hi> or <hi>token</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> unless it be something so <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>miraculous,</hi> as, that all things considered, I may reasonably conclude 'twas <hi>God</hi> alone that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it. I confess indeed, a Miracle <hi>singly</hi> is not <hi>sufficient</hi> to demonstrate any Doctrine to be of <hi>divine Revelation</hi>; for unless the Doctrine it self be <hi>good,</hi> at least unless it hath <hi>no apparent</hi> evil in it, there is <hi>no Miracle</hi> whatsoever can prove it to be <hi>divine.</hi> For there is no argument in the World can persuade a reasonable man to believe <hi>God</hi> against <hi>himself</hi>; but to believe a <hi>bad Doctrine</hi> to be the <hi>Will of God,</hi> because it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Miracles,</hi> is to believe Gods <hi>Power</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his <hi>Goodness</hi>; and it is not more certain that God doth <hi>will</hi> what he <hi>confirms</hi> by Miracles, than that he <hi>doth</hi> not, <hi>cannot</hi> will <hi>iniquity</hi>; nay of the two, I should rather believe a <hi>good Doctrine</hi> to be from <hi>God,</hi> barely because it is <hi>good,</hi> than
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:58668:328"/>
that a <hi>bad</hi> Doctrine is <hi>so</hi> because it is confirmed by <hi>Miracles,</hi> it being more possible for a <hi>wicked</hi> Impostor to work a <hi>Miracle,</hi> than for a <hi>holy</hi> God to will <hi>sin.</hi> But yet the <hi>goodness</hi> of a Doctrine singly considered, and without the confirmation of <hi>Miracles,</hi> is no <hi>certain</hi> proof that 'tis of <hi>divine</hi> revelation. 'Tis true, those things in any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which are <hi>morally good</hi> and founded upon eternal <hi>reasons,</hi> may be demonstrated true by <hi>moral arguments</hi> without any additional confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by Miracles; but if the <hi>Doctrine</hi> contain in it any Proposition that is matter of <hi>pure Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and cannot be known without it, it is hardly possible to prove such a Doctrine <hi>true</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out producing some <hi>miraculous</hi> sign of its <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>divinity.</hi> As for instance, how can a man know that God hath appointed Jesus to be the <hi>Mediator</hi> between himself and us, which is matter of <hi>pure revelation</hi> wholly depending on the free will of God, unless God <hi>himself</hi> give us some <hi>miraculous sign</hi> by which we may know that it is his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Appointment?</hi> And therefore we find that there is no <hi>Revelation</hi> or <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> but what lays claim to <hi>this</hi> way of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus the <hi>Mosaick Religion</hi> was confirmed by sundry great and stupendous <hi>Miracles,</hi> and even the <hi>false Religion</hi> of the Heathen <hi>pretended</hi> to <hi>this</hi> way of <hi>confirmation</hi> also; for generally they established their superstitious Rites by <hi>Magical Tricks</hi> and <hi>Incantations,</hi> they conjured their Demons into their consecrated Images, and made the <hi>liveless</hi> Stocks to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>speak,</hi> they pretended to effect <hi>extraordinary Cures</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of their <hi>Idols</hi>; they often <hi>raised</hi> the
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:58668:328"/>
                  <hi>Devils</hi> they adored by their Charms and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, and made them appear in strange <hi>visible shapes</hi> to their <hi>superstitious</hi> Votaries, and by these and such like <hi>miraculous</hi> pretences they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced all their <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Ceremonies; which is a plain evidence that they thought <hi>Miracles</hi> to be the most <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> arguments of the <hi>truth</hi> of any <hi>Revelation</hi>; and since the thing is capable of no <hi>better</hi> way of <hi>demonstration,</hi> it is an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable thing not to be satisfied with <hi>this</hi>; for he who will not <hi>believe</hi> that a thing which may be <hi>is,</hi> without an <hi>impossible proof</hi> of its existence, is unreasonably resolved right or wrong not to believe it. So that <hi>this</hi> way of Christs <hi>proving</hi> his <hi>Doctrine</hi> by his <hi>Miracles,</hi> and particularly by his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> being the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>most proper</hi>; if we will not <hi>believe</hi> it upon this evidence, we are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Infidels</hi> whom <hi>no reason</hi> in the World can <hi>convince</hi> or <hi>persuade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. This evidence of <hi>Miracles</hi> is the most <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>infallible Medium</hi> to prove the truth of any pretence to <hi>Revelation.</hi> For if <hi>God</hi> give a man <hi>power</hi> to do <hi>Miracles</hi> in token that what he says is <hi>true,</hi> he thereby sets his own <hi>Seal</hi> to the <hi>truth</hi> of it, and if we are <hi>satisfied</hi> that the <hi>Miracle</hi> was wrought by the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and yet will not <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> it seals, we do in effect give the <hi>lye</hi> to <hi>God</hi> himself: for a real <hi>Miracle</hi> wrought to confirm a <hi>Doctrine</hi> gives as great a <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of that <hi>Doctrine</hi> as we can have of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is the <hi>foundation</hi> of all the <hi>certainty</hi> in the World; because if once it be granted that <hi>God</hi> may work a <hi>Miracle</hi> to attest a <hi>lye,</hi> we can have <hi>no security</hi> of his <hi>truth</hi>; but for
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:58668:329"/>
all that we know every thing that he saith or doth may be an <hi>Imposture</hi>; and if so, for all we know he may have <hi>deceived</hi> our <hi>faculties</hi> too, and then there is <hi>nothing</hi> can be <hi>certain</hi> to us. The <hi>Miracles</hi> of Christ therefore, and especially this of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> gives us as great a <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of his Doctrine as we can have of any thing. For that he was <hi>raised</hi> by the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is evident, because he was really <hi>dead,</hi> his heart was pierced, and the vital bonds were broken, which rendered him utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>incapable</hi> to raise <hi>himself</hi>; and supposing that there be some Agent in Nature <hi>besides</hi> God that was <hi>powerful</hi> enough to <hi>raise</hi> him, yet we are sure the <hi>Devil</hi> would <hi>not</hi> do it, because as was shewn before, he must thereby do a thing infinitely <hi>contrary</hi> to his own <hi>temper,</hi> and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently <hi>destructive</hi> to his <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi>; nor would any holy <hi>Angel</hi> have done it without a special <hi>command</hi> and <hi>Commission</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> which is the same thing as if <hi>God himself</hi> had done it immediately. So that it's plain Christ's <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> must be effected either by the immediate <hi>Will,</hi> or by the immediate <hi>Power</hi> of God, and whether it was one way or t'other, 'twas a most <hi>certain</hi> evidence of the <hi>truth</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot be imagined that the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> would either way have <hi>raised</hi> him from the dead, had he been an <hi>Impostor,</hi> since in so doing he must have taken the most effectual course to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a <hi>Cheat</hi> upon mankind. For whilst he was <hi>alive</hi> he promised to rise again the third day, and gave this as the great <hi>Sign</hi> to the World whereby they should know that he came from <hi>God</hi>; upon
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:58668:329"/>
the hearing of which all <hi>unprejudiced</hi> minds (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering the <hi>nature</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine</hi>) had abundant reason to conclude thus with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, If this Man make <hi>good</hi> his word, we can no longer doubt but that he was <hi>sent</hi> from <hi>God</hi>; for to be sure he <hi>cannot rise</hi> unless <hi>God raise</hi> him, and it can never enter into our thoughts that the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> will <hi>raise</hi> him on purpose to <hi>delude</hi> and <hi>deceive</hi> us. When therefore he was actually <hi>risen,</hi> they could not without being guilty of the most unreasonable <hi>obstinacy,</hi> make any farther scruple of his <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>veracity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was about six hundred years ago a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Iew</hi> called <hi>El David,</hi> who gave out that he was <hi>Christ,</hi> and drew a great many Proselytes after him, upon which he was apprehended and brought before an <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince, who asked him what <hi>Miracle</hi> he could do, to convince him that he was not an <hi>Impostor,</hi> to which he answered, Sir, Cut off my Head, and in a little time you shall see me alive again; which he said to prevent some greater torments which he feared would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him for deluding the People. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Prince replied, <hi>A greater sign than this thou canst not give, and therefore if after I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed thee thou recoverest to life again, both I and all my People and all the World sure will acknowledge thee to be a Messenger from God:</hi> and presently he commanded him to be beheaded, and there was an <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Cheat</hi>; and so there would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less have been of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> if Jesus had <hi>not</hi> been <hi>raised</hi> from the dead, for he said just as this <hi>El David</hi> did, Kill me if you please, and when you have done so, you shall see I will live
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:58668:330"/>
again, and upon <hi>this</hi> I stake all the <hi>credit</hi> of my Doctrine. And therefore since it came to pass according to his <hi>word,</hi> we have all the Reason in the World to resolve with that <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince to <hi>believe</hi> and acknowledg him to be <hi>sent</hi> from <hi>God.</hi> For if there be a God that loves <hi>sincerity</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> as we are sure there is, we are equally sure he will not <hi>conspire</hi> with an <hi>Impostor</hi> to <hi>cheat</hi> and <hi>delude</hi> the World; and yet this he must have done, had Jesus been a <hi>deceiver,</hi> when he fulfilled this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous sign of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> upon which he suspended all the <hi>credit</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine.</hi> So that now we have the same <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of our <hi>faith</hi> as we have of the <hi>truth</hi> of our <hi>knowledg</hi>; for the <hi>truth</hi> of our <hi>knowledg</hi> supposes that there is a God whose Goodness will not suffer us to be <hi>deceived</hi> in those things which we <hi>clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,</hi> and the <hi>truth</hi> of our <hi>faith</hi> supposes that there is a God whose Goodness will not suffer <hi>him</hi> to <hi>deceive</hi> us in such things as he hath given us <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> reason to <hi>believe</hi>; for he who gives me a <hi>sufficient</hi> reason to induce me to <hi>believe</hi> a <hi>false</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, is guilty of <hi>seducing</hi> me into a <hi>false be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:</hi> and therefore since God in <hi>raising</hi> Christ from the dead hath given us a <hi>sufficient</hi> Argument to induce us to <hi>believe</hi> that <hi>he sent</hi> him, it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follows, either that he <hi>did send</hi> him, or that he is guilty of <hi>deceiving</hi> and <hi>abusing</hi> us.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This evidence of <hi>Miracles</hi> is the <hi>plainest</hi> and <hi>most popular</hi> to confirm a <hi>Revelation.</hi> If the Principles of <hi>revealed</hi> Religion were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>natural Reason</hi> and <hi>Philosophy,</hi> the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it would be too <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>subtile</hi> for vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar capacities, and men would never be fit to be
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:58668:330"/>
Catechized into their Religion till they had been trained up in the <hi>Schools,</hi> and there instructed in the <hi>intrigues</hi> of <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Discourse</hi>; for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of men are <hi>capable</hi> of no other notices of things but what are immediately impressed upon them by the objects of <hi>sense,</hi> nor have they <hi>skill</hi> enough so exactly to compare simple <hi>terms</hi> as to connect them into true <hi>Propositions,</hi> and from these to deduce their true and natural <hi>Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> These are things that require far more <hi>lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> and <hi>skill</hi> than Mens Education and Affairs will ordinarily afford them, so that had there not been some <hi>plainer</hi> and <hi>easier</hi> way found out to prove the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> than this, it had been a Religion fit only for the Schools of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi>; and the <hi>Vulgar</hi> who are not <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>close</hi> and <hi>strict</hi> discourse, and have neither <hi>time</hi> nor <hi>skill</hi> enough to trace the footsteps of <hi>truth</hi> through all the <hi>intricacies</hi> of <hi>reasoning</hi> and <hi>discourse,</hi> must have been damned to eternal <hi>infidelity</hi>; and this without doubt was one main reason why the <hi>Moral Philosophy</hi> of the Heathen had so <hi>little</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the People, because the Arguments by which its Principles were proved and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated were too <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>subtile</hi> for <hi>vulgar</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, insomuch that there were but <hi>few</hi> in comparison that could <hi>comprehend</hi> the <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>force</hi> of them; and in all probability as little effect would <hi>Christianity</hi> have found in the World, had it not been proved and demonstrated by <hi>such evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> as is adapted to <hi>all capacities.</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the <hi>immortality</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> is one <hi>great</hi> Principle of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion; but now had we no <hi>other</hi> way of <hi>proving</hi> this Principle than by
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:58668:331"/>
                  <hi>Philosophical</hi> Arguments, how impossible would it have been to convince the <hi>Vulgar</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of it? For first, we must have proved that the Soul is <hi>immaterial,</hi> by shewing that its operations, such as <hi>Free-will</hi> and <hi>Reflection</hi> are <hi>incompetent</hi> with <hi>Matter</hi>; from hence we must have inferred that it is <hi>immortal</hi> by shewing that what is <hi>immaterial</hi> hath no quantitative <hi>extension,</hi> and consequently is incapable of <hi>division</hi> and <hi>corruption.</hi> Now, I beseech you, what <hi>Iargon,</hi> what <hi>unintelligible</hi> Gibberish would this appear to <hi>vulgar</hi> understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? What an <hi>insignificant</hi> noise would such <hi>fine</hi> Speculations make in the ears of an honest <hi>Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</hi> But now the miraculous <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our Saviour is so <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> a proof of it, that every man may apprehend the force of it that hath the free use of his own faculties; for it is but arguing thus, and the thing is clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Christ told the World whilst he was alive that the <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>immortal,</hi> and that there are <hi>everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting</hi> habitations of <hi>weal</hi> or <hi>woe</hi> prepared for her in another World; and in token that what he said was <hi>true,</hi> he promised that the third day after his death he would <hi>rise</hi> again, which he could <hi>never</hi> have verified, had not <hi>God</hi> given him <hi>power</hi> to do it, and to be sure <hi>God</hi> would <hi>never</hi> have given him this <hi>power,</hi> had not his saying been <hi>true</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since <hi>God</hi> did <hi>impower</hi> him to <hi>rise</hi> again, it is plain that he thereby <hi>approved</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> of his saying, and <hi>justified</hi> his <hi>Doctrine</hi> to the World. This is such a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing that the <hi>shallowest</hi> minds may easily <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend</hi> the force of it; wherefore since God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed <hi>Christianity</hi> to be a Religion as well for the
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:58668:331"/>
                  <hi>Vulgar</hi> as for the more <hi>refined</hi> and <hi>elevated</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, it was highly reasonable that the way of proving its Principles should be <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi> to <hi>all capacities</hi> of men.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And lastly, This evidence of <hi>Miracles</hi> is the most <hi>short</hi> and <hi>compendious</hi> way of proving the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Revelation.</hi> One reason why the <hi>moral</hi> Philosophy of the Heathen had so <hi>little</hi> influence on the <hi>Vulgar</hi> was because their way of proving the Principles of it was so <hi>long</hi> and <hi>tedious</hi>; for they were fain to prove them by <hi>parcels,</hi> and when they had convinced their Auditors of the truth of <hi>one</hi> Proposition they proceeded to <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; and so they were fain to prove them all <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly</hi> and <hi>apart</hi> by <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>different</hi> arguments; which was so <hi>tedious</hi> a way that the <hi>vulgar</hi> had not <hi>leisure</hi> enough to attend to so great a <hi>variety</hi> of reasonings, nor yet <hi>capacity</hi> enough to retain them; but he that works a real <hi>Miracle,</hi> in token that such a Doctrine is <hi>true,</hi> proves it all at <hi>once,</hi> and needs not trouble himself to demonstrate <hi>one</hi> Proposition after <hi>another,</hi> for by giving a <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi> sign of the <hi>truth</hi> of such a Doctrine, God doth openly approve <hi>every</hi> Proposition contained in it, because it cannot be supposed that the God of <hi>truth</hi> would approve any Doctrine in the <hi>gross,</hi> if any <hi>part</hi> or <hi>Proposition</hi> of it had been <hi>false,</hi> since in so doing he must necessarily have <hi>abused</hi> our understandings, and wittingly <hi>betrayed</hi> us into a <hi>false</hi> belief, which to affirm of <hi>God</hi> is equally <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>blasphemous.</hi> When therefore God <hi>raised</hi> our Saviour from the dead, he did by that one Act <hi>openly</hi> avow the <hi>truth</hi> of his <hi>whole Doctrine,</hi> and proclaim to all the World that <hi>every

So that now we need not trouble our selves to hunt out for <hi>several Arguments</hi> to prove the <hi>several Articles</hi> of our Faith; for this <hi>one</hi> Argument serves instead of all, that God by <hi>sundry Miracles,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by <hi>raising</hi> Jesus from the dead, hath given <hi>Testimony</hi> that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which he taught is a <hi>true revelation</hi> of <hi>his Mind</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> to the World. And thus you see what a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Christs <hi>Miracles,</hi> and especially his <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> is of the <hi>truth</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine</hi>: No wonder therefore that the Apostle doth so much <hi>prefer</hi> it above all <hi>other</hi> evidence, as we find he doth, 1 Cor. 2.4. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>my speech and my teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not with the enticing words of mans wisdom, but in demonstration of spirit and of power</hi>; that is, I did not go about to convince ye with <hi>Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Harangues or <hi>fine Philosophical</hi> Reasonings, but I clearly demonstrated the <hi>truth</hi> of what I <hi>preached</hi> by the <hi>Miracles</hi> which through the power of the Divine Spirit, I wrought amongst you. So that whether we consider the <hi>certainty</hi> of Christs <hi>Miracles,</hi> but especially of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> or the powerful <hi>evidence</hi> which they give to his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> I doubt not but upon an impartial view of the whole it will appear that we have all the reason in the world <hi>firmly</hi> to assent to the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and consequently to this Article which comprehends it all, that <hi>Iesus Christ is the Mediator between God and Man.</hi>

                  </gap>e Word is superiour to all things, it hath no visible species by which it may be likened to any sensible thing, but is it self the Image of God, the most ancient of all intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibles, and next to the most High, between whom and him there is no medium. A great many other instances I could give out of this ancient Writer, but these are sufficient to prove what I intend, <hi>viz.</hi> that by the Word he meant a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Person. And then for the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase, which is one of the most ancient Monuments we have of Jewish Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is nothing more frequent in it than to signifie by this Phrase <hi>the Word</hi> a divine Person; for instead of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> in the Hebrew Text they commonly insert <hi>the word of Iehovah,</hi> to which word they attribute personal actions, by which it is evident that they looked upon it as a divine Person; thus for instance they attribute speech to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. where instead of <hi>God said,</hi> they render it, <hi>the word of God said, Exod.</hi> 20.1. instead of <hi>the Lord said,</hi> they render it, <hi>the Word of the Lord said.</hi> Again, they attribute hearing to him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.7. where instead of <hi>the Lord heard,</hi> they insert <hi>the word of the Lord heard.</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. instead of <hi>the Lord said, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the man is become as one of us, the Ierusalem Targum</hi> runs thus, <hi>the word of the Lord said, behold</hi> Adam <hi>whom I created is the only begotten in the World, even as I am the only begotten in the highest heavens.</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.3. instead of <hi>Moses went up unto God,</hi> in the Edit. Compluten. it is <hi>Moses went up into the presence of the Word of God.</hi> So also in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 17.7. instead of <hi>I will establish my Covenant between me and thee,</hi> it is, <hi>I will establish my Covenant between my word and thee.</hi> Again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24. the Paraphrase is, <hi>And the word of</hi> Jehovah <hi>sent benign showers upon Sodom and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha to try them if they would yet repent of their evil works, which when they saw they concluded, doubtless our evil works are not yet revealed before the Lord, wherefore there was sent down upon them a shower of fire and brimstone from the word of Iehovah in Heaven.</hi> So also on <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20, 21. <hi>Onkelos</hi> thus Paraphraseth, <hi>If the word of the Lord will be my helper, and lead me in the way which I go, the word of the Lord shall be my God</hi>; And on <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. the <hi>Ierusalem Targum</hi> expresly asserts, that <hi>Enoch</hi> was drawn up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the word of the Lord. And also on <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.14. the same Paraphrase affirms thus, <hi>that Abraham worshiped
<pb facs="tcp:58668:333"/>
and called upon the name of the word of Iehovah, and said thou art Iehovah,</hi> &amp;c. And on <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.19. thus both <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> Paraphrase, <hi>He that refuses to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to my words, my Word shall take vengeance upon him.</hi> And to name no more, on those words of the Hebrew Text, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.5. <hi>I will be as the dew of Israel, Ionathan</hi> thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scants, <hi>I by my word will receive their prayers, and have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on them.</hi> A great many other instances I could give, but these I think are sufficient to expose the great Immodesty of <hi>Crellius,</hi> who in a set Discourse will needs persuade the World that by the Word in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase is no where meant a Person, but meerly the speech or vocal Word of God: For how is it imaginable that by this Word they should mean no more than that, when they so commonly attribute to it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal actions, such as speaking, hearing, seeing, and desiring, drawing up men to Heaven, raining down fire and Brimstone from heaven, and taking vengeance upon men? With what tolerable propriety can these things be attributed to a vocal Word? How can a Covenant be made between men and the outward speech or declaration of God? What non-sense would it be to worship and invocate the name of Gods vocal Word, and to say of it, thou art <hi>Iehovah?</hi> With what tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sense can Gods declaration be called God or Gods only begotten in Heaven? Lastly, How can God be said to receive our Prayers, and to have mercy upon us by any such outward declaration? Since therefore it is evident that by this Word they meant a Person, and since to this Person they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe not only the Name, but the Worship of God, it is plain they believed him to be a divine Person, and that which is the sense of this ancient Paraphrase in this matter was without doubt the sense of the Jews in the Age wherein it was written. And accordingly <hi>Chalcidius ad Timaeum</hi> in that book where he professes to explain the Doctrines of the holy Sect. <hi>i. e.</hi> the Jews deliver this as their sense of this divine word, <hi>Et ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Dei Deus est humanis rebus consulens quae causa est homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus bene beateque vivendi, si non concessum sibi munus à summo Deo negligant, i. e.</hi> this <hi>Logos</hi> or Word of God is God taking care of human Affairs, and is the cause or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by which men may live well and happily, if they do not neglect this gift which the supreme God hath granted to them. And to the same purpose <hi>Celsus,</hi> speaking the sense of the Jews, expresly tells us, <gap reason="foreign">

of them call by the same names we Christians do, <hi>viz.</hi> Father, Son or Word, and Holy Ghost; and indeed, as their most ancient Writings do frequently make mention of the Word under the notion of a divine Person, as hath been shewed before; so they do also the <hi>Ruach Hakkodesh</hi> or Holy Spirit, to whom their most ancient Writers attribute all Prophesie or Revelation; for so, as I find them quoted by learned men in <hi>Pirche, R.
