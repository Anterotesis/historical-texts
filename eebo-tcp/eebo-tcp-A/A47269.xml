            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Plantain Water, or Well water,
and Vinegar mixt together, and
when he hath drunk the same,
let him go to his naked bed, and
put off his shirt, and cover him
warm, but let his bed be well

warmed first, &amp; a hot double sheet
wrapped about him, and so let him
sweat 7, 8 or 10 hours, as he is
able to endure, for the more he
doth sweat the better, because the
disease fadeth away with the
sweat; but if he cannot sweat, then
heat 2 or 3 Bricks or Tiles, and
wrap them in moist clothes wet
with water and salt, and lay
them by his sides in the bed, and
they will cause him to sweat, and as
he sweateth, let it be wiped from

conveyed into the bed, and his
sweat being ended, shift him into a
warm bed with a warm shift &amp; all
fresh new clothes, using him very
warily for taking of cold, and let
his clothes that he did sweat in, be
well aired and washed, for they
be infectious; and let the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the sick beware of the
breath or air of the party in the
time of his sweating, therefore

made new every day while
you do keep him, and let the sick
party, have of it bound in a cloth
to smell on while he is in a sweat,
then after do it away, and take a

and distempered after his sickness,
he shall eat no flesh, nor drink wine
the space of nine days, but let him
use these Conservatives for his
health, as Conserve of Bugloss, Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

he shall drink 3 or 4 days after he
hath sweat morning and evening,
3 ounces of the juice of Sorrel

and so lay it upon every joynt
where the pain is, but before the
laying of your Plaister, you must
anoint all your Joynts with the oil
of Roses, and the stuff of your
Plaister must be half an inch thick,
and according unto the property
of the same, you must let it stick
and cling where you lay it, for the
space of 9 or 10 days together,
notwithstanding it doth put you
to some pain or itch in the mean
time, yet you must in any wise let
it lie on still, for it will both draw
out the sinews by little small
pimples, and also heal it again,
and this one plaister must serve
during all the time of your disease
without any manner of renewing.

                  <p>THE many singular Favours
which I have received, not
only from your worthy self, but
also from your thrice noble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors,
justly oblige me by all
the duties of gratitude, to tender
a just acknowledgment: I wish
the same heart, that for many and
just causes truly honours, you, had
any present worthy your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Now shall it be your singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
goodness to patronage this small
Treatise, which (if I mistake not)
carries with it two parts, Delight,
<pb facs="tcp:34796:132"/>
and Utility. I doubt not then, but
that it will find a general accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
among all those who are any
way the least lovers of such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and all delightful studies. I
intend not to paraphrase upon its
worth, its use, and singular profit,
which abundantly speaks it second
unto none that hath been publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the like nature: so hoping
you will accordingly esteem of it, I
beg pardon for my boldness, and
rest ever,</p>
