            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>RIding, of late, to take a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Air, and crossing by some chance the <hi>Tunbridg Road,</hi> it was my fortune to find a parcel of Papers, which were doubtless dropt by some unwary Passenger, who had made more Haste than good Speed; and taking them up, I found they were the following <hi>Fables:</hi> which, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, some Young Gentleman of Wit
<pb facs="tcp:48381:3"/>
and Leisure, had diverted himself in composing, whilst he was obliged to drink the Waters. The Entertainment they gave me and my Friends, made me think of making them Publick; and considering the Nature of them, and that they were very fairly written, it is not at all unlikely that the Author had designed them for the Press him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. There are but two little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to the contrary, which may be also soon, answered; <hi>First,</hi> That they are too small to make a Book: the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> That some of the Fables are too bold, and might expose the Author to some Danger or Displeasure. As to the first Objection, Whoever would
<pb facs="tcp:48381:3"/>
be sure of Pleasing must not be tedious; it happens but to a few great Books to be read through; and many good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have defeated their own purpose of instructing the World, by frightning the Reader with three or four hundred Pages: but besides, the Nature of such a Work as this, requires that the Reader be never cloy'd, but always kept in good Humour and good Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, which a long Work could hardly do; and ten or a dozen Morals are enow to amuse the Mind, and keep it exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised a good while. But, after all, it may be there were many Fables more intended to follow these; and then I have nothing to say but that these were
<pb facs="tcp:48381:4"/>
all I found, and thought they were too many to be lost to the Publick.</p>
            <p>To the other Objection, the Author, having nothing to fear, has nothing to answer; for they are publish'd, if not without his <hi>Will,</hi> yet without his <hi>Knowledge.</hi> But should it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that one or two Fables are a little too bold and angry, yet since there is some Foundation for such sort of Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings and Complaints, from whence can our Rulers learn these Truths more inoffensively, than from such lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Stories? they will not, perhaps, attend so easily to wise and good Men as they will to Foxes and Asses; and wise and good Men will not, it may be,
<pb facs="tcp:48381:4"/>
dare to tell those Truths these Beasts deliver, which yet our Governours should know.</p>
            <p>I will not altogether excuse the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggeration of Matters in the twelfth Fable; for tho' our Bargain be dear enough; yet I can't tell what we should have done without it; and Things, I hope, will mend upon our hands, in good time.</p>
