            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT was so tempting a piece of Honour, to appear <hi>as the Champion of the Royal Papers,</hi> that I rather wonder that no <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Def.</hi> p. 1.</note> more, than that these, have shewed themselves to the World, under so inviting a <hi>Character.</hi> Which seems to have betray'd them into more than usual security; presuming, I suppose, that they are to be looked on, as a sort of <hi>Heralds</hi> in <hi>Controversis,</hi> whose bearing the <hi>Royal Arms,</hi> will keep them from being touched themselves, though they bid defiance to others. But where Truth lies at stake, every one hath a Right to put in for it; and whose Game soever any Person plays, those ought to carry it who have the best Cards to shew: I mean, that in Debates of this Nature and Consequence, other considerations ought to be so far laid aside, that the strongest Reason should prevail. But lest I be again thought <hi>to have a mind to flourish before I offer to pass;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> as the <hi>Champion</hi> speaks in his proper Language; I shall apply my self to the Matter before us. Only taking notice that I am now glad to enter the Lists upon even Ground. For although I thought I behaved my self with due Respect and Decency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet I perceive the Measure of those things is so nice and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, that it is very hard to escape Censures, where the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is so great. But those who live in the Country may mean and intend as well to their Prince, as those who live at Court, though they do not make so fine Legs, nor are of so pleasing an Address.</p>
            <p>The plain truth is; Controversie is quite another thing from Courtship and Poetry. It is like a Trial at Law, which ought to depend on Evidence and Proof, though the King himself be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it. And as we must <hi>give Honour to whom Honour,</hi> so Truth to whom Truth <hi>is due:</hi> and this without Respect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; it being a Case long since decided, That <hi>Truth is greater than the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:107642:3"/>
If I thought there were no such thing in the World as true Religion, and that <hi>the Priests of all Religions are alike,</hi> I might have been as nimble a Convert, and as early a Defender of the Royal Papers, as any one of these Champions. For why should not one who believes no Religion, declare for any? But since I do verily believe not only that there is such a thing as true Religion, but that it is only to be found in the Books of Holy Scripture, I have Reason to enquire after the best means of understanding the sense of those Books, and thereby, if it may be, to put an end to the Controversies of Christendom.</p>
            <p>This was the noble design of the two Royal Papers; which are written with far greater strenght, and spirit, and closeness, than these which are published in Defence of them. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all their fair appearance, I could not be convinced by the Reason contained in them, (and much less by the Defence of them) Which I endeavour'd to represent as far as I could judge, with Modesty and Civility. But if I have offended in any thing against the strict Rules of good Manners, I hope I may be the more easily forgiven, since their Casuists allow involuntary faults to be in their own nature venial.</p>
            <p>The Method proposed by the Paper for ending Controversies, was by finding out a Principle for doing it, <hi>as visible as that the Scripture is in Print.</hi> This I could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but extreamly approve, as a very satisfactory method of proceeding; and the Consequence I said would be, that all Men of sense would soon give over disputing; for none who dare to believe what they see, can call that in Question.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ply</hi> saith, <hi>I mistook the meaning of the words,</hi> which he saith was this, <hi>That what ever Motives render it visible that a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Book in Print is Scripture,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Word of God, the same or other Motives are as powerful to render this other truth as visible, that none can be that Church, but that which is called the</hi> Roman-Catholick <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Desender saith, <hi>The Church is more visible than Scripture, because the Scripture is seen by the Church; for which he brings S.</hi> Augustin<hi>'s</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Des.</hi> p. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Authority. And if by saying that the Scripture is in Print, be understood a tking out of Question; then he denies it to be visible that the Scripture, is in Print; because many Men do call Scripture in question at this day; and to question whether the Book in print be Scripture, is manifestly to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether Scripture be in print.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:107642:3"/>
The Words of the Royal Paper are plain, but these Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of them so forced and unnatural, that there needs no other confutation of them, but to compare their confused Comment with the Text. <hi>It is as visible, as that the Scripture is in Print;</hi> that is, it is a thing evident to sense; for so it is that <hi>the Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Scripture or the Bible is in Print.</hi> Now what is it which is affirmed in the Paper to be thus evident? <hi>viz. this Proposition, That none can be that one Church which Christ has here on Earth, but that which is called the Roman Catholick Church.</hi> But if it be certain (as I doubt not to make it appear) that what is called <hi>the Roman-Catholick Church,</hi> is but a Part of that <hi>One Church which Christ has here on Earth,</hi> then the plain result of this Proposition must be, that it is a thing evident to sense that <hi>a Part is the Whole.</hi> Now this looked so oddly, that these Gentlemen were resolved that this should not be the sense of the plain words; and therefore have endeavoured to put another sense, (if it may be called so) upon them. And if their Church can but interpret Scripture at this rate, we are in a hopeful way to have a speedy and happy end of Controversies.</p>
            <p>As to the Consequence I drew from hence, that if Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies could be determined by a Principle as visible as that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is in Print, all Men of sense would soon give over dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for none who dare believe what they see would call that in question; One saith, <hi>The sooner the hetter.</hi> So say I too, upon <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Des.</hi> p. 2.</note> good grounds. But what would then become of <hi>the Noble Science of Controversie?</hi> The other saith, <hi>That Catholicks and Protestants</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> p. 2.</note> 
               <hi>are both Men of sense, and yet they dispute about the Scripture which is in Print.</hi> And what then? This is to shew that <hi>the Scriptures being in Print</hi> is one thing, and the Authority of the Scripture is another. The one is a common object of sense in which all are agreed; the other is liable to many Disputes, and therefore could not be meant in the Papers.</p>
            <p>But they have a notable Cavil against Mens <hi>believing what they see,</hi> because <hi>Faith is of things not seen.</hi> This Cavil had been as good <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Des.</hi> p. 3.</note> against our Blessed Saviour, when he said to <hi>Thomas, because thou</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> p. 3.</note> 
               <hi>hast seen, thou hast believed.</hi> I hope upon second thoughts, they will not tell him, that this was improperly spoken, and not like a Schoolman. Call it what you will, the single Question is, Whether your Church will allow us to Judge of things according to the plain Evidence of Sense? One saith, <hi>It is impossible that any Man should be commanded not to believe what he sees. Believing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107642:4"/>
here is the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the Mind upon the Representation of Sense; and will he secure us that the Church can never require us to judge otherwise than according to the Evidence of Sense? I wish he would make his words good, for I assure him he would remove a terrible block out of our way. My Senses plainly tell me, what I see and feel and taste is as much Bread after Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration as it was before; how then comes it to pass that my Judgment that it was Bread before, was very good; but although there be the very same Evidence afterwards, without the least alteration to Sense, yet then I am to judge just contrary, <hi>i. e.</hi> that it is not Bread, which I see and feel and taste just as I did before?</p>
            <p>But he saith, <hi>what is seen is only the form, shape and sigure of Bread and Wine, and that they believe to be there.</hi> But alas! This doth not reach to the point. For the Question is not about external appearances, but about the Iudgment of the Mind upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Sense. I will make this matter plainer, that they may know where the Difficulty lies. When Christ's Body appeared to the Disciples after his Resurrection, there was no dispute among them concerning <hi>the form, shape and figure of his body,</hi> but the doubt was, whether from these they were to conclude that it was Christ's real Body or not? If not, they could not believe from the Evidence of Sense that Christ's Body was risen from the dead; if they were, let them tell us how Christ's Body comes to be so much changed and to lose those essential properties of a body which it once had and was judged by; and farther, what ground there is for us now not to allow that Judgment of Sense which Christ himself appealed to, after the Institution of the Sacrament? For if Christ had therein declared that our Senses are not to be our Rule of judging concerning his Body; he would certainly not have appealed so soon after to the Senses of his Disciples concerning that very Body; and neither he nor his Disciples have given the least intimation, that what we see and feel to be one body, we must believe to be quite another which we can neither see nor feel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Did not two Angels appear to</hi> Lot <hi>in the figure and shapes of Men; and the Holy Ghost descend in the form of a Dove? And were they who saw them, to believe according to the Evidence of Sense?</hi> I answer, that there is a great deal of difference to be made between In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Powers appearing under bodily shapes, and a natural, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, palpable extended body losing the Properties of a body
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107642:4"/>
abd becoming invisible, impalpable and indivisible; And withal there is a great difference, between Spiritual Powers uniting the real particles of Matter into a Body, and the making the Form, Figure, and Shape of a real Body to be where there is no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a body. We do not pretend to judge by our Senses of Invisible Substances under outward appearances; but of the Truth of a bodily Substance by all the Appearances of a body, under all the Circumstances necessary for the right judgment of Sense.</p>
            <p>The other saith, <hi>he knows of no Church which allows not People to believe all they see.</hi> May we then believe that to be still Bread <note place="margin">Def. p. 3, 4.</note> which we see to be so? No, he saith, <hi>the What of a thing is not the Object of Sense.</hi> I perceive then our Senses are very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent things; and only give an account of the Circumstances and not of the Substances of things. But I pray did not the Disciples perceive the <hi>What</hi> of Christ's Body by their Senses? How do we know the <hi>What</hi> of any bodily Substance but by them? It is meer Collusion to say <hi>our Senses do not judge of Substances;</hi> for our bare Senses judge of nothing, but are the means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the impressions or Representations inward, whereby our Minds do pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Judgment upon things. And either we cannot know the Substance of any thing sensible, or we must know the <hi>What of it</hi> (as he speaks,) by our Senses.</p>
            <p>We now come to the main business; which for the clearer proceeding I shall put under three distinct Heads.</p>

               <head>I. <hi>Of the Unity of the Catholick Church.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ANd here the point to be discussed, is, <hi>viz. Whether that which is called the Roman-Catholick Church, be that one Church which Christ has here on Earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The first thing I objected against it was, that a Part can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Whole; but that which is called the Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church is but a Part; and therefore it cannot be the One Catholick Church of Christ here on earth.</p>
               <p>Here, to prevent cavilling, I must declare that I meant not the <hi>Roman Diocese</hi> or <hi>Province,</hi> but <hi>all the Churches which live in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with and Subjection to the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>as Head of the Church; and look on it as necessary to Salvation so to do.</hi> And this I still assert to be but a Part of the Catholick Church and a corrupt one too.</p>
               <p>The Author of the <hi>Defence</hi> saith, <hi>all this Riddle of Part and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>Whole comes from my Inadvertence.</hi> How so? <hi>Because I confound the Roman Diocese with the Roman-Catholick Church.</hi> No, I assure him I did take it in their own sense, <hi>for all that embrace the matters of Faith</hi> which are received in <hi>the Roman Communion.</hi> And He need not fear my doing otherwise; for I intend to discourse of no other Church but this; and this I deny, as so taken, to be the <hi>One Catholick Church. Doth not Catholic signifie all the Parts?</hi> I am sure it ought to do so; but I say it doth not, when <hi>Roman</hi> is joyned to <hi>Catholick;</hi> for then it excludes all those from being Parts of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> which do not joyn in the <hi>Roman Communion;</hi> and this I say is unreasonable. And here I expected some Proof in so material a Point; but there is not a Word farther, than that <hi>Catholic comprehends all;</hi> but I say again, <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> excludes all that are not in its Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. As suppose any one should say <hi>the</hi> German <hi>Ocean is the whole Sea;</hi> and to prove it, should reason as this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doth; <hi>Ocean is the whole Sea, is it not? And is it the less
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107642:5"/>
the Ocean, because</hi> German <hi>is added to it?</hi> No; the Ocean is just as large as ever it was; but the adding <hi>German</hi> to it restrains the sense of <hi>Ocean</hi> to it within certain bounds; and excludes many parts of the great Ocean, which are without those li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. Just so it is in adding <hi>Roman</hi> to <hi>Catholic; Catholic</hi> alone comprehends all the Parts of the Church, but <hi>Roman</hi> added to it confines the Sense of it to those who embrace the Faith received in the <hi>Roman Communion;</hi> and this excludes all other Parts of the <hi>Catholic Church:</hi> and so makes a Part to be the Whole.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) I objected farther, that if this had been the Catholic Church meant in the Creeds, this limitation ought to have been expressed in the Creeds, and put to Persons to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; which being never done in the Roman Church it self, I thence inferr'd that it did not believe it self to be the one Catholic Church, which we profess to believe in the Creeds.</p>
               <p>Here the Author of the <hi>Reply</hi> answers, <hi>that Catholic and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Catholic were in the Language of Antiquity one and the same thing; and this point being never called in Question in the time when the Creeds were published, there was no occasion to put Roman into the Creeds; no more than of putting in Consubstantial with the Father till it was denied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This were a substantial way of answering the Difficulty, if it would in any measure hold. But I shall now prove just the Contrary to have been the Sense of Authority by plain and undeniable Instances in matters of fact, in most of the Ages of the Christian Church; from the very next to the Apostolical, down to the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> To which I shall only premise this, which I think no <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> will deny me, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Roman Catholic Church doth imply Obedience to the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>as Supream visible Head of the Church under Christ.</hi> For <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and others, <hi>make not only Faith and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And the Proofs I bring shall not be from short or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sentences, but from remarkable passages and notorious Acts of the Church.</p>
               <p>In the First Age of the Church the name <hi>Catholic</hi> was as little known, as the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once found in the Apostolical Writings; for the Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Catholic Epistles</hi> are of latter times. And if they were allowed to be Apostolical, they would be far from proving any thing to this purpose, since the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is never mentioned in these Epistles, unless under the name of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and I suppose they would not like the Title of the <hi>Catholic Babylonish Church.</hi> But in all the directions of the Apostles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Unity of Faith, there is not one which gives the least intimation, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in any sense was to be the Rule or Standard of Faith or Communion.</p>
               <p>In the Second Age we find two remarkable Instances that the Communion of the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> was not to be taken from <hi>Conjunction with the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>as Head of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is from the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi>'s approving <hi>the Prophecies of Montanus, Prisca</hi> and <hi>Maximilla.</hi> This would hardly appear credible, if <hi>Tertullian</hi> had not expresly affirmed it; and he farther saith <hi>that had it not been for</hi> Praxeas <hi>a Heretick, he had taken them into the</hi>

                  <hi>Communion of the Catholic Church; and he prevailed with him to revoke his communicatory Letters already past.</hi> What a Case had the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> been in at this time, if the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had been look'd on as the <hi>Centre of Catholic Communion,</hi> and if he had not been better informed by <hi>Praxeas a Heretick?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second in the same Age is when <hi>Victor</hi> took upon him to excommunicate the Eastern Bishops for not celebrating <hi>Easter</hi> at the same time they did at <hi>Rome.</hi> If now the Eastern Bishops did own the <hi>Roman-Catholic</hi> and <hi>Catholic Church</hi> to be the same, they must shew it at such a time by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Pope's sentence as <hi>Head of the Catholic Church:</hi> but they owned no such Authority he had over them; and instead of it <hi>Polycrates</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> with a Council of <note place="margin">

way, notwithstanding his threats, and that it was better to obey God than Man.</hi> From whence it is observable, That they followed their own judgment against the Pope's; and that they believed the Pope required things of them so contrary to the Will of God, that they resolved to disobey him. And his requiring their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance was no Argument of his <hi>Authority,</hi> but of his <hi>Us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the Third Age happen'd a famous contest between <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>African Bishops,</hi> about <hi>Re-baptizing Hereticks.</hi> I meddle not now with the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie it self, but with the Sense of those Bishops upon occasion of it as to the <hi>Roman-Catholic Church.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> did at least threaten to Excommunicate the <hi>African</hi> Bishops.

They charge <hi>Stephen</hi> with <hi>Insolence, Folly, Contempt of his Brethren, and breaking the Peace of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic</hi>

And whether Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> were thought to be the <hi>Centre</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> in the <hi>Catholic Church?</hi> It is plain, they made him <hi>the Cause of the Schism,</hi> and thought themselves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the less in the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> for being out of the <hi>Roman Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Fourth Age the Government and Subordination of the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> was established in the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> according to ancient Custom; but we read not a word of the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church</hi> there; or any Priviledge or Authority the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had, but within his own Province, and such as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> had in theirs. And when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi> in that Age interposed to restore some Bishops cast out of Communion by the Eastern Bishops, they declared against it as a violation of the Rules of the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> and this became the Occasion of the first Breach between the Eastern and Western Churches. In the same Age <hi>Liberius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> joyned with the Eastern Bishops in casting <hi>Athanasius</hi> out of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> and subscribed the <hi>Arian Confession of Faith;</hi> as both <hi>Hilary</hi> and S <hi>Ierome</hi> witness; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from his Seventh <hi>Epistle,</hi> and the old Lesson in the <hi>Roman

And because the notion which <hi>Innocent</hi> III. gives, is liable to the same charge, it cannot be excused from the same guilt.</p>
               <p>Thus we have found the Author of this Notion of the <hi>Roman Catholic Church,</hi> viz. for such as own the Supremacy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as he explains it more fully in the same Epistle.</p>
               <p>

But yet this Notion of the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> was not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally received after <hi>Innocent</hi> III. For in the Fifteenth Age, in the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Bessarion</hi> disputing with the <hi>Greeks</hi> about the Authority of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Florent.

From whence it follows, that the Notion of the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> cannot be taken from owning the <hi>Roman Church to be Mistress of all Churches;</hi> for then the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> is bound to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Decrees of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> about Matters of Faith.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the same Age the Council of <hi>

And why should <hi>so scandalous an Article be</hi> suffered to stand, unless there were such a consent of Copies that it could not for shame be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved?</p>
               <p>The Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> was confirmed by the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> and is to this day maintained by the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> as appears by their Declaration made <hi>A. D.</hi> 1682. From whence it follows, that the Church is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Catholic</hi> from relation to the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> but <hi>to the whole Body of Christians:</hi> and that the <hi>Unity</hi> of it, is not to be taken from the respect it bears to an <hi>external Visible Head</hi> which may sail, but to Christ <hi>as the essential Head of the Church.</hi> This is the express Doctrine of the <hi>Cardinal de Alliaco, Ioh.

Almain, Gerson</hi> and many others; and follows from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Council of <hi>Constance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have briefly deduced the Sense of the Christian Church in this matter from the Apostolical times; and that not meerly from the sayings of particular Men; but from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, solemn, and undoubted Acts of the Church. Which I have the rather done, because the <hi>Defender</hi> saith, <hi>we have no Antiquity on our sido in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">(3.) I said farther, that if the Roman Church belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it self to be the Catholick Church, it must void the Baptism of those who are out of its Communion; but since Baptism doth enter persons into the Catholic Church, by its own Confession, the Catholic Church which is owned in the Creeds, must be of larger Extent than the Roman.</p>
               <p>In Answer to this, they both tell me <hi>this point</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reply p. 8. Defence p. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>hath been over-ruled long ago by the Catholic Church; the Baptism of Hereticks being allowed to be good.</hi> But since it is granted, that Baptism doth enter Persons into that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church we believe in the Creeds,</hi> doth it not evidently follow, that the <hi>Catholic Church in the Creeds</hi> is larger than the <hi>Roman Communion? For it takes in those which the other doth not.</hi> Doth not the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> take in all that are admitted into the <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> but many more by their own Confession are admitted into it than are of the <hi>Roman Communion,</hi> and therefore it unavoidably follows, that the <hi>Roman Catholick Church</hi> cannot be the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> believed in the two Creeds.</p>
               <p>And although according to S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> the validity of Baptism depends on the right form of words and not the good Disposition of him that administers; yet Baptism where it is valid must have its due Effect, which is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Persons into the Catholic Church.</p>
               <p>But say they, <hi>Doth not Heresie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cast them out of the Catholic Church?</hi> Suppose it doth, yet if Heresie do cast them out, they were in the Church till they were cast out of it.

                  <hi>times, and the same Means which were then used to preserve the Unity of the Catholic Church, did equally serve for after Ages and continue to this day, and so the Unity of the Catholic Church is still as visible as ever it was.</hi> This in few words I take to be the force of what he saith. But certainly there was a time when the Unity of the <hi>

                     </gap>hurch</hi> was a little more discernable than now it is. Doth not the Scripture tell us, <hi>the Multitude was of one heart and one Soul?</hi> Are all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans so at this day? I grant afterward there were <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Heresies</hi> in the Apostolical Churches. But the Apostles had an Infallible Spirit, which they manifested by the Power of Miracles going along with it, by which means the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies</hi> were laid open and the <hi>Schisms</hi> stopped. But what were those <hi>Heresies?</hi> Such as contradicted the <hi>Articles of the Creed,</hi> as about the <hi>Truth of Christ's Incarnation,</hi> and the <hi>Resurrection of the Dead</hi> &amp;c. and therefore the Apostles by the Assistance
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107642:12"/>
of that Infallible Spirit did write Epistles to the Churches, to declare that which was to be the standing Faith of all Ages; and by an unquestionable Tradition (in the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> they summ'd up these Fundamental Points of Faith in that which is therefore called <hi>the Apostles Creed.</hi> This was therefore the Standard whereby to judge of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Heresie;</hi> and by this, they proceeded in the Ages succeeding the Apostles. Afterwards, some did not bare faced contradict the Articles of the Creed, but broached such Doctrines as did by consequence overthrow them; as the <hi>Arians</hi> by making a <hi>Creature God,</hi> the <hi>Nestori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And thus the Creed was enlarged by general Consent through the <hi>whole Catholic Church,</hi> and that which was called the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> was made the standard of <hi>Catholic Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to prevent any Mischief by overcharging the Creed, the General Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> did <hi>absolutely forbid any farther addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil Ephes. Part</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>Chalcedon. Act.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>to be made to it,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> ratified that prohibition. All that they pretended to, was only to give the true Sense of the Articles therein received about the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, and the same was declared by the fifth and sixth General Councils; whereof the one was to clear the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> from favouring <hi>Nestorianism,</hi> and the other to shew that the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> in Christ was perfect, as to the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul as well as the Body.</p>
               <p>But after this, a mighty Breach happen'd between the Eastern and Western Churches; and setting aside the different Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms in both (which might easily have been composed) there were two things, which made this breach irreconcileable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Western Churches taking upon them to make a New Addition to the Creed; as to <hi>the Spirit's proceeding from the Son;</hi> without asking the Consent of the Eastern Churches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s assuming to himself an Authority of <hi>Headship over the Catholic Church.</hi> They did not deny him <hi>a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of Order,</hi> as he had the first Patriarchal See; but when he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107642:13"/>
took upon him to exercise Jurisdiction in the other Patriarchates as well as his own, and sent Legates for that purpose, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected his Authority, and so the Breach continued.</p>
               <p>But the Defender saith, <hi>the Popes Supremacy, if his Memory fail him not, was not so much as made a pretence till near</hi> 200 <hi>years after</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Des. p. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>the Schism began, nor any where more acknowledged than in</hi> Greece, <hi>nor by any body more than by him that began the Schism.</hi> If his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory fail him not, I am sure, something else doth. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more notorious from the very Epistles of the <hi>Popes</hi> on Occasion of this Schism, than that this was at the bottom of all; whatever pretences might be made use of sometimes to palliate the matter. Let him but read the Epistles of <hi>Leo</hi> I. to <hi>Anatolius</hi> and concerning him; the Epistles of <hi>Gregory</hi> I. about the title of Oecumenical Patriarch; the Epistles of <hi>Nicolaus</hi> I. concerning <hi>Photius;</hi> of <hi>Leo</hi> IX. concerning <hi>Michael Cerularius,</hi> and I think he will be of another Opinion; and that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie about Supremacy, to the Scandal of the Christian World, was the true occasion of that dreadful Schism. But all the Eastern Churches I said however different among themselves to this day, look on the Pope's Supremacy as an Innovation to the Church.</p>
               <p>To which the Replier saith, <hi>the Eastern Churches were divided from the Roman-Catholic Church by such Doctrines as are inconsistent with the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>which professes to hold with the four first General Councils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not deny but the breach as to the <hi>Nestorians</hi> began on the account of the Council of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> but whether the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians under the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> are truely <hi>Nestorians</hi> is another Question: I think not, for this Reason. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Century, the Patriarch of those Christians called his most learned Men about him to consider what their Doctrine really was, and how far they differ'd from the Roman Church about Christ; since the Missionaries from thence, still charged them with Heresie: and they declared the difference to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Words and the manner of explication. For however they say that every Nature hath a Person inseparable from it (by which they mean no more than a Subsistence) yet from the Union of these two in Christ, they hold that there is but one <hi>Persona</hi> they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107642:13"/>
Natures and <hi>one Filiation</hi> (as they speak) resulting from it, it is beyond my understanding that they should be guilty of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian Heresie.</hi> And this account was given to <hi>Paul</hi> 5. by one sent from their Patriarch, and ordered to be Printed by him at <hi>Rome.</hi> But is it not really a very hard Case for 300000 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, <note place="margin">

I appeal to the Conscience of any good Christian, whether he thinks Christ and his Apostles did ever make the knowledge of these things necessary to Salvation; which the subtilest of their Schoolmen are never able to explain to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of the sar greatest part of Mankind.</p>
               <p>The like may be said, as to those called <hi>Eutychians,</hi> I do not doubt but the Confusion of both Natures in Christ was a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine justly condemned by the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> because he could not be true Man, if the Nature of Man were lost in him; but I think there is no Reason to condemn those for that <hi>Heresie,</hi> who declare they reject the Doctrine of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and that they hold <hi>two Natures in Christ making up one Personated Nature without mixture or Confusion,</hi> as their Patriarch explained their Doctrine to <hi>Leonardus Abel</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sidon,</hi> when <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grory</hi> 13. sent his <hi>Nuncio</hi> into those parts, on purpose to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>In the ancient Church there were two sorts of <hi>Schisms,</hi> which I think it material to observe.</p>

               <p n="1">(1.) A Factious Schism; when Men out of opposition to their lawful Governours, in the Church set up <hi>separate Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</hi> Which by the Fathers are called <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) A <hi>Sacrilegious Schism</hi> is that which robs the Church of God of that which belongs to it, <hi>i. e.</hi> which excludes all but their own Number from being true Members of the Church. And this was the <hi>Schism</hi> charged on the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatists.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And whosoever follow their steps, and exclude any Parts of the Church from being so, and confine the Church to their own Communion, they are guilty of the same <hi>Sacrilegious Schism;</hi> which is of a higher nature than a meer Factious Schism. But the <hi>Defender</hi> saith, <hi>The Language of the World has always preserved the Title of Catholic to one Part, and given the name of Sect or Part</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>cut off to the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>Language of the World,</hi> he must mean of <hi>that Part</hi> which excludes the rest. Which he calls <hi>the World</hi> by the very same Figure by which <hi>a Part</hi> challenges to be <hi>the Whole.</hi> But in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to this, for all that I can yet see, these who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> must be taken in by <hi>Baptism.</hi> And S. <hi>Cyprian, Firmilian,</hi> and S. <hi>Basil</hi> saw this well enough. I confess it was after carried, That <hi>Hereticks</hi> were to be distinguished, and those only to be Re-baptized who renounced the Baptismal Faith, in Father, Son and Holy Ghost. And the meaning, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that nothing but that exclude Persons out of the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> and those <hi>Hereticks</hi> whose Baptism was allow'd, were of an inferiour sort; and by not disowning their Baptism, they shew'd they looked on them only as <hi>corrupted Parts of the Church.</hi> And so did the Councils of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Arles;</hi> which did <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Nic. c.</hi> 19. <hi>Arel. c.</hi> 8.</note> not utterly reject <hi>Re-baptization,</hi> but only <hi>of those who preserved the Baptismal Faith.</hi> It was not therefore the Sense of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church, that upon every dissension in matters of Faith from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107642:16"/>
the general Doctrine of the Church, one Party must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> and that Title belong to the other.</p>
               <p>But he proceeds, <hi>That this Presumption cannot be the Cause of Schisms, which must happen before the Presumption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is very easily answered. For a breach there must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but the <hi>Schism</hi> belongs to those who were the <hi>true Causes</hi> of the Breach. If therefore any one Part assumes to it self the right of the whole, and requires the owning it from all that joyn in Communion with it, this very act makes it justifiable (not to separate from the <hi>Catholic Church)</hi> but not to joyn in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with that Part on such unreasonable terms.</p>
               <p>Well, saith he, <hi>Suppose the dividing Parts do still continue Parts</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>of the</hi> Catholic <hi>Whole; cannot the</hi> Roman-Catholic <hi>be that Whole,</hi> i. e. Suppose there be many Parts, why may not one of them be the Whole? For still, the <hi>Roman-Catholic</hi> is but <hi>a Part,</hi> though <hi>Catholic</hi> be <hi>the Whole;</hi> as though the Ocean be the whole, yet the <hi>British,</hi> or <hi>Gallican,</hi> or <hi>Spanish,</hi> or <hi>Atlantick Ocean,</hi> is but a Part of the <hi>Whole Ocean.</hi> I am ashamed to pursue so clear a point any farther.</p>
               <p>But he hath one fetch behind still, <hi>viz. That it is one Faith</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>which makes the</hi> Catholic Church <hi>one; if therefore the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church be a Part of this</hi> Catholic <hi>Whole, the other Parts must believe as she does, or else they cannot be Parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will endeavour to make this clear to him, and so end this Dispute.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church</hi> is a Society of Persons who own and profess the Christian Faith; Therefore Faith is necessary to the very being of a Church; for unless they believe the <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> they cannot be the Christian Church. This Faith which is necessary to make them Christians, is to be embraced by all who are Members of this <hi>Church;</hi> their entrance is by <hi>Baptism;</hi> the Faith is the Creed delivered to those who are to be Baptized; which being universally received by Christians, that makes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bond of Union in the Parts of this great Body; and this is the <hi>One Faith of the</hi> Catholic Church.</p>
               <p>But if he thinks the <hi>Roman-Catholic Church</hi> can make all its Decisions <hi>a Part</hi> of this <hi>one Faith,</hi> he is extreamly mistaken. As will more fully appear in the following Discourse.</p>

Where the Church is. 2. Whether the Church hath declared its Judgment or not.</p>
               <p>And several things are objected in the Papers against the not submitting to the Churches Judgment, <hi>viz. That every one will be his own Iudge; which is not allowed in common mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, much less in matters of Faith; that no such Authority is given to every particular Man by Scripture; but the Churches Authority is there established; and was owned in the Primitive Church in the Creeds, and about the Canonical Books; and since the Church had once such a Power, there is no reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n to suppose it lost; but upon differences happening, the Churches Iudgment is to be submitted to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the whole strength and force of the First Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and it is about a Subject of the highest Importance, both as to the satisfaction of particular Persons, and the Peace of the Christian World. And the clearing thes. Two Points will go a very great way towards the putting an end to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107642:17"/>
Controversies. 1. That in all Disputes we are to search no farther, but presently to yield to the Judgment of the Church. 2. That the <hi>Roman-Catholic Church</hi> is that Church. How far I am from being satisfied with the latter doth already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; I now set my self to consider the other.</p>
               <p>And here are these things necessary to be debated,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether Christ and his Apostles did establish such a standing Judicature in the Church, to which all Christians were bound to submit in matters of Faith?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the Primitive Church did own such a Judicature; And did accordingly govern their Faith?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether it be an unreasonable thing to suppose the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ should leave Men to judge for themselves in matters which concern their Salvation, according to the Scriptures?</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Whether Christ and his Apostles did establish such a standing Judicature in the Church to put an end to all Controversies which should arise about matters of Faith? We do not Question but Christ might have done it if he had pleased; and there is no doubt he foresaw all those Inconveniences which are now objected against the want of it; But the point before us, is, Whether Christ, who alone could do it, hath declared this to be his Will and Pleasure? We are then to consider, that this being a Point of so great Consequence, the Commission for such a Court of Judicature in the Church ought to be delivered in the plainest and clearest Words that may be; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise this were to beget Controversies instead of putting an end to them. When God under the Law, established a Supreme Court of Appeal as to the differences which might arise about the Law, he tells them where that Court should <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> fit, and commands the People to go up thither and hear their Sentence and submit to it. This was a plain and clear
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107642:17"/>
declaration of the Will of God; and they had no more to do but to go up to the Place which God did chuse, <hi>viz. Ierusalem.</hi> And there was never any dispute aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rwards among the <hi>Israelites</hi> what they were to do when Differences happened; for an Appeal lay to the Court of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the Sentence of that Court they were to stand to on pain of Death. Our blessed Saviour knew this Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he founded his Church; and if he had intended any such thing therein, he would not have fallen short of the exactness of the Law in the things necessary in order to the Establishment of it; <hi>i. e.</hi> he would not have failed to have told us, who were to make up that Supreme Court, and where it was to Sit. For these things were necessary to the end of it. Shall we then say that Christ was not yet resolved where it should be? Or, that it was not fit to let it be known so soon? But why not, when he made Promises to the Apostles of <hi>being with them to the end of the World?</hi> There can be no pretence, why he should not then declare, where the Supreme and standing Court of his Church was to be; which was in all Ages to give Rules to the rest of the Church, and to Determine all Points of Faith which came before them.</p>
               <p>But did the Apostles Determine this matter after Christ's Ascension? If they had done it, we must have yielded, because they had an Infallible Spirit: But we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it in all their Writings. They mention <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi> often, and <hi>damnable</hi> ones they saw <hi>creeping into the Church,</hi> they lamented the Schisms and Divisions in the Churches of their own Planting, and used frequent and vehement Exhortations to Peace and Unity. But why not a word of the Infallible Judge of Controversies all this while? S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and even there mentions <hi>Dissensions that were among them,</hi> as well as <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 17.</note> in any other Church. What, could not he tell them they were to make Rules and give Judgment for the whole Church? Did S. <hi>Paul</hi> envy this Privilege to S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s See, and therefore took no notice of it? That I suppose will not be said of him, though he once <hi>withstood him to the face.</hi> But, how happen the rest of the Apostles
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107642:18"/>
not to do it? Nay, how came S. <hi>Peter</hi> himself, writing for the benefit of the whole Church, in a <hi>Catholic</hi> Epistle, never to give the least intimation concerning it? These things make it appear incredible to me, that Christ or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles appointed any such thing; especially, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in their infallible Writings give such Directions to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Christians as they do; <hi>to prove all things, and to hold</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 21.</note>

And if Christ and his Apostles knew nothing of such an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge; we have no Reason to hearken to any, who after their time should pretend to it. For the Promise of Infallibility must be made by him; and such a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion can be derived only from the immediate Authority of Christ himself.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Defender</hi> saith, <hi>The Holy Scripture assures us that the Church is the Foundation and Pillar of Truth.</hi> I confess, I cannot be assured from hence, that the Church hath such an Authority as is here pleaded for, suppose it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the whole Church. For how was it possible the Church at that time should be <hi>the Foundation and Pillar of Truth,</hi> when the Apostles had the Infallible Spirit, and were to guide and direct the whole Church? It seems therefore far more probable to me, that those words relate to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> and not to the <hi>Church,</hi> by a very common <hi>Elleipsis,</hi> viz. <hi>how he ought to behave himself in the Church of God, which is the House of the living God, as a Pillar and Support of Truth:</hi> and to that purpose this whole Epistle was written to him; as appears by the beginning of it, wherein he is charged <hi>not to give heed to Fables, and to take care that no false Doctrine were taught at Ephesus.</hi> Now, saith the Apostle, <hi>If I come not short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet I have written this Epistle that thou maist know how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have</hi>

               <p>It was farther answered, That all this makes nothing for the <hi>Roman-Catholic Church</hi> not then in being, unless she were Heir-General to the Apostles; that the ordinary Power of the Keys relates not to this matter; that the Promise of the Spirit made to the Apostles, implied many Gifts not pretended to by this Heir-General, as the Gift of Tongues, Spirit of Discerning, Prophecie, miraculous Cures and Punish ments.

                     </gap>t if the Church once makes Shipwrack of Faith, she is no more a Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How comes <hi>Faith</hi> to be separated from a <hi>good Conscience?</hi> I am sure <hi>S. Paul</hi> joyns them together. Is no Error consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the Being of a Church? Not an Error about
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107642:20"/>
the <hi>Seat</hi> of <hi>Infallibility?</hi> Not an Error about the <hi>Immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Conception?</hi> Nor about the <hi>Vision of God before the day of Iudgment?</hi> Not about the Son's being of the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with the Father? Not about Christ's having a will proper to his humane Nature? Then there can be no such thing as the Roman-Catholic Church in the opinion of those who are for personal Infallibility of the Pope, since the Heads of their Church have erred about these things. The true Church can never make shipwrack of that Faith which makes her a true Church: But other kind of Errors cannot overthrow her being.</p>
               <p>I urged farther, That notwithstanding the pretence to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, they allow the Church may err in matters of Practice of the highest importance, as about Deposing Princes and Absolving Subjects from their Allegiance; but not about the least matter of Faith; which made it very suspicious to be rather a politick device than a thing they really believed.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Defender</hi> (I fear wilfully) mistakes my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for he argues as if he thought I were proving, <hi>That</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Def. p. 34, 35.</note> 
                  <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath defined the Deposing Doctrine as a matter of Faith;</hi> and great pains he takes to prove it hath not. And all to no purpose. For I insisted only, that in this point, they confessed their Church had <hi>grosly erred as to a matter of Practice,</hi> though it had not expresly declared it as an Article of Faith. I desire him to speak out; hath it not erred notoriously as to Practice in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Whether they have made any such Declaration or not, as to oblige all others of their Communion to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Doctrine; it is undeniably true, that their Popes and Councils have owned it and acted according to it, to the mighty disturbance of the Peace of the Christian World. Now the question I put was this, Since it is granted they have so notoriously erred in matters of Practice, why should any believe them Infallible in Points of Faith? <hi>i. e.</hi> that so many Popes, so many Councils, should act upon this principle, as believing it to be true, and yet preserve their Infallibility in not declaring it to be true. This I confess is an extraordinary thing; and the <hi>Defender</hi> seems in earnest
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107642:21"/>
to think they were kept from it <hi>by an over-ruling assistance of the Divine Spirit.</hi> Which is just as if a Man were set upon in the Road by some pretending to be his Friends, who should take from him all that he had, and afterwards he should admire the Providence of God, that these Men should not declare it lawful to do it. It is granted that so many Popes did great Mischief to the World, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to Christian Princes, by acting according to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and that they actually owned it in Councils, and made Canons on purpose for it, but yet <hi>an over-ruling Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance kept them from making it a Point of Faith.</hi> They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their own belief by their Practice and Canons; they required the observance of them under pain of being cut off from the Church if they did it not; and <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. <hi>Epist. Reg. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Ep.</hi> 2.</note> saith, <hi>They cut themselves off who question this Power;</hi> but they were deceived, notoriously deceived in this matter, yet they might be Infallible still. Did not these Popes declare that to be Christs Doctrine which is not? <hi>But not Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively.</hi> What I pray doth this mean? Did they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this Power by vertue of the Authority given them by Christ over the Church? And declare those Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate who did not obey their Sentence? Is not this proceeding <hi>Authoritatively?</hi> Suppose the Popes had in the same manner declared that Hereticks should be Re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; <hi>i. e.</hi> made Canons for it, and required the observance of them; I desire to know whether this had not been <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative declaring</hi> it, though they affixed no <hi>Anathema</hi> to those who held the contrary? Is it possible for any Man to believe, that if there were such a thing as Infallibility in the Guides of the Church, that Christ would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to run into such pernicious Errors, and in such an <hi>Authoritative manner,</hi> and yet make good his Promise of keeping them from Error by not suffering them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine this Doctrine as an Article of Faith? But this will appear to be a very slender Evasion, if Men will reflect on the nature of the matter it self; for it is about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Pope's Power over Princes; and can it be supposed that since they challenged it, they would ever suffer it to be debated in Councils; but they would still
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107642:21"/>
have it pass as an inseparable Right of their Supremacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from S. <hi>Peter.</hi> And all that they would allow in this Case, is a bare Recognition; and that was made in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Lateran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Deposing Power in the Church, was sufficiently owned in the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are two sorts of Articles of Faith to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Some are defined with an <hi>Anathema</hi> against Dissenters; and so we do not say the Deposing Power is made an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some are received upon the common Grounds of Faith, though not expresly declared. And whatever Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being denied would overthrow them, may be justly look'd on as a Presumptive Article of Faith. As the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deposing Power must charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Representative and Virtual with such acts, as are utterly inconsistent with the Promises of Divine Assistance sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be made to it. Therefore all those who sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe those Promises to belong to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> so taken, must in consequence believe so many Popes and Councils could not be so grosly mistaken in the Ground of their Actings. And I find those who do now most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that this Doctrine was never defined, do yet yield, that both Popes and Councils believed it to be true, and acted accordingly.</p>
               <p>But if nothing will be allowed to be points of Faith, but what passes under the Decision of Councils approved by the Pope as such, I pray tell me, which of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils determined the Popes Supremacy as a Point of Faith? Where was the <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> Churches Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility defined? Are these Points of Faith with you, or not? If they be, then there may be Points of Faith among you which never passed any Conciliar Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or such Authoritative Declaration as the <hi>Defender</hi> means.</p>

(2.) I now come to consider the Sense of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church about this matter of an Infallible Judge of Controversies. Which I am obliged to do, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is said in the Papers, <hi>That the Church exercised this</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Power after the Apostles;</hi> but because the <hi>Defender</hi> brings <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> as <hi>rejecting the Scripture from being a sufficient Rule for Controversies; and S.</hi> Augustine, <hi>as setting up the Authority of the Church above the Scripture in matters of Proof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I confess two lame sayings of Fathers make no great impression on me. I am for searching the sense of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church in so weighty a Point as this, after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner; (but as briefly as may be) <hi>i. e.</hi> by the general Sense of the Fathers of the first Ages about the <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi> then on foot, that I may not deceive my self or others in a matter of this Consequence.</p>
               <p>The point is, Whether according to the sense of the Primitive Church, when any Controversie about Faith doth arise, a Person be bound to submit to the Churches Sentence as Infallible; or he be required to make use of the best means he can to judge concerning it, taking the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures for his Infallible Rule?</p>
               <p>Now to judge the Sense of the Primitive Church about this Point, there can be no method more proper or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing than to consider what Course the Christian Church did take in the Controversies then started, which were great and considerable. And if it had been then believed that Christ had left such an infallible Authority in the Church to have put an end to them; it had been no more possible to have avoided the mention of it, than if a great Cause in Law were to be decided among us, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party should ever take notice of the <hi>Iudges</hi> in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were two very great Controversies in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, which continued a long time under different Names; and we are now to observe what method the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Writers of the Church took for establishing the true Faith.</p>

                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> undertakes the same Cause in several Books and several ways. One is by shewing that the Opinion of the Hereticks was novel; not being consistent with the Doctrine delivered by the Apostles, as appeared by the unanimous consent of the Apostolical Churches; which did all believe Christ had a true and real Body. And this way he made use of, because those Hereticks either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, or interpolated, or perverted the Books of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. But this way of <hi>Prescription</hi> look'd like <hi>Out-Lawing</hi> of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and never suffering them to come to a fair Trial. Therefore in his other Books he goes upon three substantial Grounds. (1.) <hi>That the Books of Scripture do</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De Carut Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti, &amp;c. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. &amp;c. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentin.</note> 
                  <hi>certainly deliver the Doctrine of the Christian Church concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christs having a true Body.</hi> (2.) <hi>That these Books of Scripture were not counterfeit, nor corrupted and adulterated; but preserved genuine and sincere in the Apostolical Churches.</hi> (3.) <hi>That the sense which the Hereticks put upon the Words of Scripture was forced and unreasonable; but the sense of the Church was true and natural.</hi> So that <hi>Tertullian</hi> did conclude, that there was no way to end this Controversie but by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the true sense of Scripture.</p>
               <p>But the Author of the <hi>Defence</hi> brings in <hi>Tertullian, as</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I grant <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath those words; but for Truths sake I wish he had not left out others, <hi>viz. That those Hereticks do not receive some Scriptures; and those they do receive they add and alter as they please. And what,</hi> saith he, <hi>can the most skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Scriptures do with those who will defend or deny what they think fit? With such indeed,</hi> he saith, <hi>it is to little purpose to dispute out of Scriptures.</hi> And no doubt he was in the right; for the Rule must be allow'd on both sides; or else there can be nothing but a wrangling about it. The first thing then here, was to settle the Rule, and for this the Testimony of the Apostolical Churches was of great use. But to imagine that <hi>Tertullian</hi> rejected all trial of Doctrines by <hi>Scripture,</hi> is to make him to write to little purpose af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; when he combates with all sorts of Hereticks
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107642:23"/>
out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as appears by his Books against <hi>Marcion, Praxeas, Hermogenes</hi> and others.

               <p>The other great Controversie of the first Age, was about <hi>the Divinity of Christ;</hi> which begun with the <hi>Ebionites</hi> and <hi>Cerinthians,</hi> and was continued down by succession, as appears by <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s account of Heresies in his second Book. Those who first embraced this Heresie rejected the whole <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and received only the <hi>Nazarene Gospel.</hi> But after a while <hi>Artemon</hi> had the boldness to assert that the Apostles deliver'd the same Doctrine in their <hi>Writings,</hi> and then the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie was reduced to the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture. Paulus Samosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> follow'd <hi>Artemon,</hi> as <hi>Photinus</hi> afterwards follow'd him. But <hi>Theodoret</hi> again observes, <hi>That all those Heresies against the Divinity of Christ were in his time so extinct, that not so much as any remainders of them were left;</hi> but saith he, <hi>The true Doctrines of the Gospels prevail and spread themselves over the World.</hi> And we may find what course was taken for putting an end to this Controversie, by the management of it with <hi>Paulus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosatenus.</hi> In the fragment of an Epistle of <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> we read the <hi>Testimonies of Scripture</hi> which he produced against him; and more at large in the <hi>Epistle</hi> of the <hi>Six Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to him;</hi> who makes use of the very same <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> which are most applied to that purpose to this day.

               <p>Which being affirmed by a Person of so much Judgment and Learning, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> was, gives us a plain and evident Proof, that the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> may be so fully clear'd, without an <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church,</hi> as to be effectual for putting an end to Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</p>
               <p>And altho we own a great Esteem and Reverence for the Four <hi>General Councils;</hi> yet we cannot but observe, that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies were so far from being ended by them, that they broke out more violently after them.

               <p>But I proceed to shew what means were used in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church for putting an end to Controversies. Of which we have a remarkable Instance in the Dispute about <hi>Rebaptizing Hereticks.</hi> This was managed between St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and other Bishops of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> on one side, and <hi>the Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> on the other. He pleaded <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Tradition:</hi> the other, <hi>That Custom without Truth was but ancient Error; and that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">St. Cyprian, Epist. 74, 75.</note> 
                  <hi>ought to be examined by Scripture;</hi> and many Reasons they bring from thence; because Christ said in his Gospel, <hi>I am Truth; and the only way to prevent Errors, is to have recourse to the Head and Fountain of Divine Tradition,</hi> i. e. <hi>to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls the <hi>Evangelical and Apostolical Tradition.</hi> So that we have the clear Opinion of the <hi>African Bishops,</hi> that this Controversy ought to be decided by Scripture. But here the Replier saith, <hi>That Right stood for the Bishops of</hi> Rome, <note place="margin">Reply, p. 13.</note>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:107642:25"/>
                  <hi>and a General Council determined the Point, and the whole Church came to an Acquiescence.</hi> If the Council was in the Right, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi> was not; if St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> represent his Opinion truly, and he saith he did it in his own Words, which are, <hi>Si quis a quacunque Haeresi venerit ad nos, nihil innovetur nisi quod Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est.</hi> Now, no Council ever determin'd so, That whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Heresy was, none should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But St. <hi>Augustin</hi> is the Man, whom the Defender produces against <note place="margin">Def. p. 18.</note> me; <hi>because against the</hi> Manicheans, he saith, <hi>he believed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the sake of the Church; and to bring any proof out of Scripture against the Church, does weaken that Authority, upon which he believed the Scripture, and so he could believe neither.</hi> The meaning wherof is this, St. <hi>Augustin</hi> was reduced from being a <hi>Manichean</hi> to the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> by many Arguments; and by the Authority of the <hi>Church</hi> delivering the Books of <hi>Scripture,</hi> he embraced the Gospel, which before he did not. Now, saith he, <hi>You would make use of this Gospel to prove Manichaeus an Apostle, I can by no means yield to this way.</hi> Why so? Do not you believe it to be Gospel? <hi>Yes,</hi> saith he; <hi>but the same reason which moved me to embrace this Gospel, moved me to reject
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107642:26"/>
Manichaeus, and therefore I have no reason to allow a Testimony out of it for Manichaeus.</hi> Not that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> seared any proof that could be brought from thence; but he begins with general <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> did against the Hereticks of his time, before he came to close with them. And such was this which he here produces. For in case <hi>Manichaeus</hi> his Name had been in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel as an <hi>Apostle of Christs appointing,</hi> this Argument of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> had not been sufficient. For there might be sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from the Churches Authority to embrace the <hi>Gospel;</hi> and yet if the Scripture had been plain, he ought to have believed <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi> his <hi>Apostleship,</hi> though the Church disowned it. As I will prove by an undeniable Instance: Suppose a <hi>Jewish</hi> Proselyte to have argued just after the same manner against <hi>Jesus being the Messias;</hi> the Apostles go about to prove that he was so, by the Testimony of the Prophets: No, saith he, I can allow no such Argument: because the same Authority of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church which perswaded me to believe the Prophets, doth likewise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me not to believe <hi>Jesus to be the Messias.</hi> If it be so far from holding in this case, neither can it in the other. For it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon a very feeble Supposition, that no Church can deliver a Book for Canonical, but it must judg aright concerning all things relating to it. Which unavoidably makes the <hi>Jewish Church infallible</hi> at the same time it condemned. Christ as a Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. But this was only a witty velitation in St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> used by Rhetoricians, before he entered into the Merits of the Cause. And it is very hard when such sayings shall at every turn be quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, against his more mature and well weighed judgment.</p>
               <p>What noise is there made in the world with that one saying of his, <hi>I should not believe the Gospel, unless the Authority os the Cathelick Church moved me?</hi> And the Defender brings it to prove <hi>the Church more visible than Scripture.</hi> Whereas, he means no more by it, but that the authority of the Church was greater to him, than that <note place="margin">De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> p. 2.</note> of <hi>Manichaeus.</hi> For he had been swayed by his authority to reject the Gospel; and now he rejects that authority, and believes the Catholick Church rather than him. And this doth not make the Churches authority greater than Scripture, but more <hi>visible</hi> than that of <hi>Manichaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Testimony here be allowed to extend far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet it implies no more than that the constant, universal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Scripture by the Catholick Church, makes it appear

               <p>The <hi>Arrian</hi> Controversie gave a great disturbance to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church; and no less a man than the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> thought <hi>there was no such way to put an end to it, as to search the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures about it;</hi> As he declared to the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> at their meeting, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith.

                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was well acquainted with all the Heresies of the Church, and the best means to suppress them; and certainly he would never have taken such pains to refute so many Heresies out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> if he had look'd on the <hi>Church</hi> as the <hi>Infallible Judg of Controversies.</hi> For he not only undertakes to give the <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> for the ending of Controversies, but he supposes <hi>all Persons capable of understanding it, that will apply themselves to it.</hi> Which he <note place="margin">Haer. 75. p. 923 943, 989.</note> several times affirms in the consutation of his last Heresie.</p>

But the Case of Councils came to be very different, when they took upon them to define other matters for which they had no Colour in Scripture (as the <hi>2d</hi> Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did, which was the first that went upon Tradition) and then the Christian Church did not shew such Respect to them; as was most apparent in the Case of this Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which was universally rejected in these <hi>Western</hi> parts, <hi>(Rome</hi> excepted) as appears by the Council of <hi>Fran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is certain that <hi>Leo Armenus</hi> in the <hi>East,</hi> as well as <hi>Charles,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Niceph. cum Leone Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Disput. ed.

While Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils did declare, that they intended to make use of no other Rule but Scripture, and to deliver only the Sense of the Catholick Church from the beginning, a great regard was to be shew'd to them: but when they set up another Rule, the Christian Church had just Reason not to submit to their Decrees. And to say, <hi>This is the Plea of all Hereticks,</hi> is just as if an innocent Person might not be allowed to plead <hi>not Guilty,</hi> because the greatest Malefactors do the same. There must be some certain Rules whereby to proceed in this matter: and this is the first We fix upon, That they proceed as the Ancient Councils did according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

(2.) The Ancient Hereticks were condemned by such Councils, as did represent the <hi>Universal Church</hi> after another manner, than the <hi>Council of</hi> Trent did.

                  </gap>n the matter of Faith, to be debated in the General Council; and I have Reason to question whether this were ever done. But however, there is a very great difference in the Ancient Councils from the modern, as to this point of <hi>Representing,</hi> for in them there was the Consent of all the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and a general Summons for the Bishops from all parts to appear. But in the Modern Councils, <hi>four Patriarchs,</hi> and the Bishops under them, have been excluded; and the <hi>5th</hi> hath Summon'd the Bishops under him to meet together, and then hath called this a <hi>General Council.</hi> Which is just as if in the time of the <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> the King of <hi>Mercia</hi> should assemble the States un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and call the <hi>Convention</hi> of them, <hi>The Parliament of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Thus in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Pope Summons the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops that owned his Supremacy, and had taken Oaths to him, to meet together, and would have this pass for a <hi>General Council.</hi> When the Council met, and Cardinal <hi>Hosius</hi> was appointed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident in it; <hi>Stanistaus Orechovius,</hi> a warm and zealous <hi>Romanist,</hi> writes to <hi>Hosius,</hi> That it would very much conduce to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Interest, if the Patriarchs of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> were Summon'd to the Council, because the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> depended upon them: <hi>And he could not understand how the Catholick Church could be Represented without them, nor how the Council could be called Oecumenical.</hi> To which <hi>Hosivs</hi> Replied, <hi>That the Pope being Oecumenical Patriarch, a Council called by him, was an Oecumenical Council.</hi> Now this we say, is extreamly different <note place="margin">Hos.

               <p n="3">(3.) Themselves allow that some Councils may be, and ought to be rejected; and therefore all our business is to enquire whether we may not with as much Reason reject some Councils, as they do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

The <hi>2d</hi> Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> wanted no just Summons, no presence of Patriarchs, or number of Bishops, yet this is rejected, <hi>because its Proceedings were too Violent.</hi> The Councils of <hi>Constantinople</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Images are rejected; because, but <hi>one Patriarch</hi> was present in either of them. Now I desire to know, whether it be not as lawful to except against other Councils, as against these, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Reasons to be the same; and greater Evidence to be given in these latter Times, of the Truth of the Allegations. Besides, we find they are divided in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning their lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Councils: Some say, The Councils of <hi>Pisa, Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> were true General Councils, and that the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Leo</hi> X. was not so; others say, That the former have not the Authority of General Councils, but the latter hath. Some say, That there have been 18. <hi>General Councils;</hi> so the <hi>Roman</hi> Editors of the Councils, and others; but a great number of these are rejected by others, who allow but 8. of the number, <hi>viz.</hi> those wherein the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Bishops met. And so the Councils of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> besides others, are cut off. What becomes then of the Articles of Faith, defined by those Councils? For they cannot be received on the account of their Authority. However, we find this Objection lies equally against them, as against us. For, do not both these differing Parties side with the <hi>Ancient Hereticks,</hi> as much as we do? For they except against the <hi>Supreme Judicature</hi> in the Church, and decline the Judgment of these Councils, as much as those Hereticks did the Councils of their own Times.</p>
               <p>These are therefore but ordinary <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">(2.)

               </p>
               <p>To this the Replier saith only, <hi>that these are voluntary assumpti</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Repl. p. 8</note> 
                  <hi>ons without proof:</hi> and his saying so, needs no Answer.</p>
               <p>The Defender shelters himself under the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and <note place="margin">Def. p. 23</note> resolves not to put to Sea with the Answerer about these things. But he knows very well, we utterly deny any of these to have been the practice of the Universal Church according to <hi>Vincentius Lerinensis</hi> his Rules; by which we are content to be tried. And although he seems to wish for such a trial, yet I know a reason why they ought to decline it, because I am certain they can never make it good in any one of them.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The second Inconvenience objected was, <hi>That this would make the wisdom of God fall beneath the discretion of prudent Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers; who do not make Laws, and leave every man to be his own judg as to right or wrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was answered three ways:</p>
               <p n="1">(1) That there are Inconveniencies on both sides, and one ought to be provided against, as well as the other; sor as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not to be their own Judges, so it may happen that an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper may pretend to the right of Interpreting the Laws, only to justifie his Usurpation.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) That the People are allowed in some sense to interpret the Laws, or else they could never understand the duty they owe to their lawful King, and to justifie his Rights against all the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Usurpers.</p>
               <p>To this the Replier saith nothing, and the Defender saith that which is next to nothing to the first, and takes no notice of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Answer; and I think I therein tell him plainly enough, what I would be at. He saith, <hi>I mean receiving and holding the true faith by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Usurpation.</hi> Nothing was farther from my thoughts. But I had thought it were easie enough to know whom I meant, <hi>viz.</hi> such a one as pretends to an Infallible Chair, which they cannot deny themselves to be the highest Usurpation, if he cannot prove his Title by Scripture, as we are sure he cannot.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) That in this Case a Rule is given to direct persons in the way to Heaven, and therefore must be capable of being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by those who are to make use of it for that end. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the greatest concernment to Mankind, they are therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to search into it for their own Salvation; but we exclude not the help of Spiritual Guides, and embrace the ancient Creeds of the Church.</p>
               <p>To this the Replier answers two things:</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>That an Infallible Guide is necessary to secure persons from wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Errors, which he saith God hath provided. From wilful Error!</hi> this is new Doctrine indeed, <hi>that God hath provided a remedy for wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Error.</hi> Had not our Saviour himself an Infallible Spirit, and yet we do not read that ever he secured men from wilful Error? or ever designed to do it. But suppose an Infallible Judg could do this, he doth not tell us where he is to be found, who he is, and in what manner he doth thus secure men, which are very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Enquiries; and without being satisfied in all these points, we are still left to be our own Judges, so far as concerns the way to Salvation; since at the day of Judgment we must answer for our selves, than which there can be no greater obligation to care and sincerity in judging. Suppose a mans life depends upon the benefit of his Clergy, and one comes to him and tells him, You are an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant man, and liable to great mistakes in reading, therefore I advise you by no means to trust to your own skill in Reading, for it is a horrible dark Letter, and many have been mistaken that were more <hi>Book learned</hi> than you; therefore take my counsel, there is Mr. <hi>Ordinary</hi> who understands <hi>Book-learning</hi> a thousand times better than you or I, trust him for the Reading, and no doubt you will escape. Ay, Sir, saith the man, all that is very true that you say, but my life lies at stake; and how if Mr. <hi>Ordinary</hi>'s Reading will not be allow'd by the Judg for mine, then I am a lost man past recovery; therefore I am resolved to learn to read my self; and to that end I will make the best use of his skill to instruct me before-hand that I may be able to answer for my self. This needs no Application.</p>

And in case of difference among Guides, if a man sincerely makes application to God, to know the Truth he doth not question but such is the mercy of God to keep such a one from dangerous Error; or if he doth suffer him to fall into Error with a good mind, it shall not be imputed to him.</hi> It is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine generally receiv'd in the Schools, <hi>That where ever God doth</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This ought to have been a little proved. For in truth we are apt to think <hi>the Faith once delivered to the Saints</hi> as suffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I am content, saith the Heir, with my Ancestors Estate, and I will never part with my old Deeds for all your <hi>new Settlements;</hi> for I am sure my Ancestors would never deceive me; but I know not what designs you with your new Settlements may have upon me, and therefore I pray let me alone with my old Deeds.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Defender</hi> here dances upon Ropes, he makes swift and quick <note place="margin">Def. p. 26</note> motions, but he stands on a slender bottom, and he knows not whereon to fix, but would seem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That which he aims at, is, <hi>That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a man by judging controversies by the Infallible Rule, be able to come to an Infallible Determination, then controversies will not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107642:31"/>
determined, if every man be left to be his own Judg.</hi> And I am clearly of his mind. But the point is, whether such an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble determination of Controversies be the necessary way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? If a man can judg well enough to carry him thither, that is as much as I am concerned for at present.</p>
               <p>But he goes on. <hi>Who can hope to he saved without pleasing God?</hi>

               <p>But after all he saith, I confess <hi>that Scripture is not the Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies.</hi> I pray why? for I take it not only to be the <hi>Rule,</hi> but to be the <hi>only Rule.</hi> For, saith he, <hi>they are not ended till one side or other be certain.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat then? is there no <hi>Rule</hi> that doth not put an end to Controversies? Nay their own Writers say <hi>a Rule, as a Rule</hi> cannot put an end to them, and therefore a <hi>Judg</hi> is necessary. But I must answer such things as they bring.</p>
               <p>In matters of good and evil, I said every mans conscience is his immediate Judg, and why not in matters of truth and falshood; unless we suppose mens involuntary mistakes to be more dangerous than their wilful sins.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Defender</hi> triumphs. <hi>How?</hi> saith he, <hi>are we before we are aware come to conscience at last?</hi> I heartily wish we were, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t would tend more to the ending of controversies than an Infallible Judg.</p>
               <p>But he wonders that in Disputes of Religion <hi>it should before we are aware come to conscienoe at last.</hi> Good man! <hi>he was not aware</hi> that there was any thing of conscience in the matter. Doth he think it is only matter of interest we contend about? so those who believe no Religion themselves, think all controversies about Religion, to have nothing of <hi>conscience</hi> in them.</p>
               <p>But after a long harangue, he saith, <hi>Toat conscience can do no more</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 28.</note>

                     </gap>ng Faith, what can he answer for the sin of having that conscience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I grant where it is a sin to have such a conscience, the conscience doth not excuse the faults a man commits by it. But the Question we are upon is, whether it is not a sin for a man to have such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; and we are not upon the point of an <hi>Erroneous conscience,</hi> but of an <hi>Infallible Judg</hi> of <hi>conscience</hi> in matters of good and evil. And it is strange the Defender should not see this. There is no question,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107642:31"/>
but there are as disputable Points in Morality, as in matters of Faith; and we think Mens committing Sin, is at least as dangerous to their souls, as embracing what they call <hi>Heresy.</hi> Now I desire to know, why it is not as necessary to have an infallible Guide in Manners, as in Faith? But, if they think that Men may be let alone to judg as well as they can in such matters, as their Salvation certainly depends upon, what monstrous Inconvenience is it, if they use the same Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in matters of Speculation? I would he had given some better An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that I might have had an occasion to have inforced this matter. For in truth it seems to me, a very strange thing, when I read in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> such terrible Denunciations against the practice of Sin, and that mens happiness or misery depends so much on their doing Good or Evil; and so very little said as to mens errors or mistakes of Judgment (where there is a general Sincerity, as to a good Life, and a care to please God) that so much weight should be laid on an infallible Judg in matters of Controversy, and no care taken for an infallible Guide in matters of Practice.</p>
               <p>But I am to consider, that it tends more to the interest of some People to swagger about an infallible Faith, than to secure the Practice of Virtue, and a good Life, which yet is certainly the great design and concernment of the Christian Religion, however it may seem to some, that an infallible Faith and Church are all in all.</p>
               <p>To shew we do not allow every man to believe as he pleases, I said, We not only allow the Assistance of spiritual Guides, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ancient Creeds; but think no man ought to follow his own fancy, against Doctrines so universally received from the Apostles times.</p>
               <p>But all this signifies nothing to him, unless our Guides be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and he saith, <hi>They are plainly no Guides of Christs appointing, who</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Def. p. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>teach any other Doctrine than he taught.</hi> Very well! Let this then be the Rule, whereby we are to judg whether Guides are Infallible or not. But then have a care of telling us we must believe what. Doctrine it was that Christ taught, upon the word of these Infallible Guides, for by that Doctrine we are to judg whether they be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible or not. The different methods of his Proceeding and mine in this matter, will be best understood by this Comparison.

Ay Sir, saith the Traveller, you speak indeed to the purpose, I pray acquaint me with it. There is, saith he to him, at such a Hill, a Person, who by the help of Wings, not only flies over all that dangerous passage, but carries all those safe, who take hold of him: You have therefore no better way than to pinion your self to him, and you will be safe But saith the Traveller, how if he and I should tumble down together, what would become of us both? Never fear that, saith he: But how should I help fearing of it? Have any that he carried thither, come back and assured others of the safety of the passage? No. But how then? Why saith he, You are bound to believe what he saith, for he affirms that he can do it. But, saith the Traveller, this is very hard I must venture Body and Soul upon his skill and strength, and I must take his Word that he hath both. This seems very unreasonable to me, and therefore I am resolved to take the other course, which tho it do not make such big boasts of it self, is much more likely to be safe in the conclusion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving better Reason on its side, and requiring a more constant care of my self, to which God hath promis'd more of his Grace and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to secure me from all fatal mistakes of my way.</p>
               <p>Where I mention <hi>Doctrines so universally received in the Christian Church from the Apostles times, as those in the Creeds;</hi> The Defender makes a notable Exception, <hi>As if,</hi> saith he, <hi>any part of the universal Christian Doctrine were lost, and all had not be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I desire him to take his choice, either <hi>Supremacy, Transubstantiation, Infallibility of the</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> or which he pleases. I grant all true Christian Doctrine was universally retained, as far as the Rule of it was so received; but if he means any of those distinguishing points between us and them, when he comes to make it out, he will be of another mind.</p>

(3.) A third Inconvenience objected in the Papers, against the want of an infallible Judg, was, <hi>That Scripture would be interpreted by Fancy; which is the same thing as to follow Fancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this it was answer'd.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That our Church owns the Creeds, Councils, Fathers, and Primitive Church, more frankly than any other Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be suspected to leave Scripture to be so interpreted.</p>
               <p>The Replier saith, <hi>We only pretend it, and do it not.</hi> That is to be <note place="margin">Reply, p. 21.</note> proved, for bare saying it, will never convince us. But his proof is, <hi>because, if we had done it,</hi> we had never deserted the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and our Answer is, we therefore deserted the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Church, because She required owning things from us, for which She had no Authority, either from Scripture, Creeds, Councils or Fathers.</p>
               <p>The Defender would have me answer directly, <hi>Whether it be not the same to follow Fancy, as to interpret Scripture by it?</hi> As tho I were <note place="margin">Def. p. 30.</note> examined at the Catechism, which requires all answers to be made by <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay.</hi> I said enough to shew the Question doth not concern us; for we do not allow Persons to interpret Scripture by Fancy. And withal. (2.) I asked some other Questions to shew, That those who pretend to Infallibity, may do things as unreasonable as leaving Scripture to be interpreted by Fancy. And I have our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours example for answering one question with another.</p>
               <p>The Instances I gave, were these; The Church of <hi>Romes</hi> assuming to it self the Power of interpreting the Rule, which concerns its own Power of interpreting; which was to make it Judg in its own Cause, and to give it as great Power, as if it <hi>made</hi> the Rule; and I further added, that <hi>Interest</hi> is as mischievous an Interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Fancy;</hi> and therefore, those who are so much concerned, are not to be relied on, either in Councils, or out.</p>
               <p>The Power of declaring Tradition is as Arbitrary a thing in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as interpreting Scripture by Fancy. There being no other Rule allowed by it, but the Sense of the present Church.</p>
               <p>The Replier, like a fair Adversary, gives his answer plainly; <note place="margin">Reply. p. 21.</note> which consists in two things. (1.) <hi>That their Church gives no Sense of Scripture, but what She received from Tradition of the foregoing Church, and so he calls it Apostolical Tradition.</hi> But suppose there happen a Question, whether it be so or not, must not all be resolved into the Authority of the present Church, declaring what is Apostolical Tradition? And so it comes all to one.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:107642:33"/>
(2.) He saith, <hi>Tradition is publick, and Fancy is private.</hi> But I say, according to their Rules, <hi>Tradition</hi> is but <hi>publick Fancy,</hi> and so <hi>Fancy</hi> in particular Persons is a <hi>private Tradition;</hi> but whether publick or private, if it be equally Arbitrary, the Case is alike.</p>
               <p>The Defender saith, <hi>All this is besides the Business,</hi> and therefore slides off as well as he can, with some slight touches, which deserve <note place="margin">Def. p. 31.</note> no Answer.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>If there be no infallible Judg, the Power of deciding matters of Faith will be given to every particular man, for which no place can be shewed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Answer was, That if by deciding matters of Faith, no more be meant, but every mans being satisfied of the Reasons, why he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves one thing to be true, and not another; that belongs to every man as he is bound to take care of his Soul, and must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count both to God and Man, of the Reason of his Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This,</hi> the Replier saith, <hi>is bringing every Article of Faith to the Test of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reply, p. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>ones own Reason; whereas Authority is the Correlative of Believing, and Reason of Knowledg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do not pretend that every one that believes, should be able to judg from meer Principles of Reason of the Credibility of the Doctrine propos'd; it is sufficient, if he finds it to be of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, by being contained in Gods word. And it is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, but of Divine Revelation, which Faith bottoms upon; the former is no more than an inducement to believe those Books we call Scripture, to contain the word of God in them. But when we find any Doctrine therein, we account that sufficient Reason for believing it.</p>
               <p>The Defender finds no fault with our saying, <hi>We ought to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Def. p 32.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Reason why we believe;</hi> but the Question he puts, is, <hi>Whether there be indeed any Reasons why they should believe besides the Authority of the Church?</hi> He doth not deny that particular Men ought to judg; <hi>but the meaning of the Papers,</hi> he saith, is, <hi>that they ought not to judg unreasonably.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then we have no difference, for I assure him I never pleaded for mens judging unreasonably.

We utterly deny the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility

                  </gap>re we must judg more reasonably. What follows about the Infallibility promised to the Church, hath been answered already.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Canonical Book,</hi> I shewed it was no <hi>Authoritative De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi> by a Power in the Church to make Books <hi>Canonical</hi> which were not so, but a meer giving <hi>Testimony</hi> in a <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> in which all parts of the Church are concerned; and it depends as other Matters of Fact do, on the Skill and Fidelity of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters: And so far I own the truly <hi>Catholick Church</hi> to have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in any Testimony, delivering down the Books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but this proves no more <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the Christian Church as to the Books of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> than it doth in the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> as to the Books of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi>

               <p>All these I shall examine with Care, and consider what hath been said in Defence of the Papers upon these Heads.</p>
               <p>As to the charge of causless Breach in the Communion of the Catholick Church, it lies in these Words, <hi>And by what Authority Men separate themselves from that Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being spoken with respect to the Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do imply that they have made a Separation from the Communion of the Catholick Church, and that they had no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Authority for so doing, and therefore are guily of Schism in it.</p>
               <p>To the Question two Answers were given, 1. By distinguishing the truly Catholick Church from the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick: And a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between these being made out, (which is done in the first part of this Defence) It doth not follow that we have made a Breach in the Communion of the Catholick Church, because we do not join in Communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick: This was illustrated by the Example of a prosperous Usurper in a Kingdom, who challenges a Title to the whole, by gaining a considerable part of it, and requires from all the Kings Subjects within his Power, to own him to be rightful King; whereupon the Question was put, Whether refusing to do it, were an Act of Rebellion or of Loyalty? So in the Church, the Popes Authority over it, so as to restrain Catholick Communion only to those who own it, is not only looked on as an Usurpation by Us, but by all the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches; and is in Truth altering the <hi>Terms</hi> of Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from what they were in the truly Catholick and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Church: Therefore since the Conditions required are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, because different from them, what Breach hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not to be imputed to those who refuse these Terms, but to those who impose them; and so the Guilt of it lies upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not upon the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This is the Substance of the Answer.</p>
               <p>To which the Replier saith, <hi>That the</hi> Eastern <hi>Churches cannot be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reply, p. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>parts of the Catholick Church, because they hold not the Apostolick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contained in the Creeds and Councils owned by the Church of</hi> England. This hath been fully answered already. But he goes on, <hi>There were no other Churches then in being, but those which were in Communion with the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>consequently the Church of</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:107642:34"/>
England <hi>going out from them, separated her self from the Catholick Apostolick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Defender saith, <hi>He expects I should shew That truely Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Def. p. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>and Apostolick Church we held Communion with, when we sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the</hi> Roman. <hi>He desires to know where the men live, that people may go to them, and learn of them, what their Faith is,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In answer to this, I say, That there is no necessity for us to shew any Church distinct from others, which in all things we agreed with; because we hold all particular Churches liable to Errors and Corruptions; and that the notion of the Catholick Church may take in such Particulars from which we may see reason to dissent: But we do not thereby exclude them from being parts of the Catholick Church; but we say they are no Infallible Rule to us, and therefore we ought to proceed by what the Church hath receiv'd as an Infallible Rule, and not by the Communion of other Churches. And supposing there were no particular Church we did in all things joyn with, the Church of <hi>England</hi> might Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it self without separating from the Catholick Apostolick Church. For it was then in the Case, particular Churches were in after the Councils of <hi>Ariminum</hi> and <hi>Seleucia;</hi> for then the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Catholick Communion, set up by the Council of <hi>Nice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> was taken down; and the setting of it up again, was to oppose the Consent of the Christian Church in the most General Council that ever Assembled. I do not say, this Council obliged men to profess <hi>Arrianism;</hi> but that it took away the Authority of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Creed</hi> in as valid a manner as the Council by its Acts could do it; I ask then, by what Authority any particular Church could set up the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith; and if not, how it was possible to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored? And <hi>I desire to know in what Country the people lived, who then owned the</hi> Nicene <hi>Faith against such a General Council? And where were the Churches in being, which at that time adhered to it?</hi> But if in this Case the <hi>British Church,</hi> tho alone, was bound notwithstanding such a general consent, to Reform it self, and to restore the Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed; the same Case it is, when the Western Church was oppressed and hindered from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Errors and Abuses by the Usurpation and Tyranny of the Papal Faction; the Church of <hi>England</hi> was then obliged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise its own Inherent Right, in bringing things to the state they were in, in the time of the first General Councils. In matters of Reformation, the main enquiries are, whether there be just Occasion,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107642:35"/>
and due Authority for it, and a certain Rule to proceed by; the last and least important Question is, what Company we have to joyn with us in it? For there is a Natural Right i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> every Church to preserve its own just Liberties, and consequently to throw off such an Usurpation as that of the Popes was. And the main Point in order to a Reformation, was casting off the Popes Power, as an encroachment upon the Ancient and Canonical Priviledges of the Western Churches, which was done here by a General consent even of those Bishops, who held in Communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as far as those could do who rejected the Head of it. And this is the Fundamental Point as to the matter of Schism: If the Pope, as Head of the Church, doth influ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ce Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion so far, that it is necessary to Salvation to live in subjection to him, it will be very hard to justify separation from that Body whereof he is the visible Head. But if there be no Scripture, no Councils, no Universal Tradition for this, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Bishops here declared in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 8. then there can be no Schism in acting without Authority from him, or against his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And whether any other Church joyned with ours or not, is no more material to the justification of the Reformation, than the lawfulness of any one Counties Acting for the Royal Family in the late times of Usurpation, did depend upon the concurrence of others with it. What more commonly talked of, and magnified in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This, I say, was the Case of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Reforming according to Scripture, and the sense of the Primitive Church; and if others joyned, so much the better; if not, the Act justifies it self, and needs not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of others to make it good.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>2d</hi> Answer was, That there is a difference between voluntary Separation, and that which is unavoidable, in case un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable conditions of Communion be required.</p>
               <p>The Defender pretends <hi>He can by no means understand this una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Def. p. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Separation; because tho Men be separated from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Church, yet they may continue of the same Faith if they please:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107642:35"/>
but if they have another Faith, they separate themselves, even supposing Usurpation, or whatever I would have.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this seems very strange to me from a person who knows the Terms of Communion with the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> Can any Man be a true Member thereof, who doth not own and profess to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Popes Supremacy, Transubstantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is he not by the constitution of that Church required to believe all that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church</hi> believes? But suppose men do not, and cannot for their hearts believe as that Church believes; can they notwithstanding be Members of it? No, he confesses <hi>a different Faith unavoidably casts them out.</hi> But then to believe otherwise than the <hi>Roman Church</hi> believes, casts them out unavoidably. The Question now is, who is the cause of this casting out, those who cannot believe those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, or those who require the belief of them in order to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? If these Doctrines be evident in Scripture, or were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the four General Councils, or are contained in the ancient Creeds, or can be clearly proved by Universal Tradition, then we confess the blame falls on those who refuse; but if none of those can be made appear to the satisfaction of a mans mind who desires to search out Truth, then their separation is unavoidable, and there is no reason to make it their voluntary act. But, saith the Defender, <hi>a mans faith is his own voluntary act.</hi> I grant that; but not a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <note place="margin">Def: p: 40:</note> cause of Separation: which two ought to be distinguished in this case. As in the case of Usurpation, the owning the lawful King is a voluntary act; but if an Usurper threatens to banish him if he doth not abj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re him; upon whom must the blame be laid, upon the mans voluntary act, or the Usurpers voluntary imposing such a penalty on those who do nothing but what is just? The Defender did not consider that the making such terms of communion was a voluntary act too, and being a thing unreasonable and unjust, it leaves the blame upon the imposers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he denies any such thing as Usurpation in the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pe, because he hath shewed by his reiterated Approbation of the Bishop of</hi> Meaux's <hi>Book, that he is content with that submission and obedience, which the Holy Councils and Fathers have always ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght the Faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are very fine words to deceive the unwary. But I pray tell us, who is to declare <hi>what the Councils and Fathers have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taught the Faithful? Who is to be Judg?</hi> Is not the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? For no Council will be allowed without his Approbation and Confirmation. And is not this then a very pretty Artifice to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107642:36"/>
draw weak persons into a snare? For my part, I do not wonder at the <hi>Popes Approbation of the Bishop of</hi> Meaux's <hi>Book,</hi> no more than I would at a Gentlemans approbation of a fine spun Net when he goes a fishing, which is not so easily discerned, and yet doth as effectually catch the Game: Some there are still who love to be deceived, and some have more arts of deceiving than others; and those who gain most by it, will be sure to give them the greatest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
               <p>The Defender proceeds: <hi>Suppose there were Usurpation, must people therefore believe otherwise than they did before; as that there is no change of Substance, no Purgatory, no more than two Sacraments,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>and the rest?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Question about Faith is one thing, and about Separation is another. We are now upon the latter of these; and in this case we are most concerned about the Popes Authority, since he is look'd on by you as the Head of the Catholick Church, and the Center of Communion. If there were no such Usurpation, yet we should never decline giving an account of the Reasons of our Faith, as to Sacraments, Purgatory, or what you please of the Points in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between us. Which I neither desire to make greater or lesser, than really they are. For there may be deceit both ways.</p>
               <p>As to his renewing the Question, <hi>by what authority we separate?</hi> I answer, by the same authority which makes it unlawful for us <note place="margin">Def. p. 42.</note> to profess what we do not believe; and to practise what we believe God hath forbidden: This is just as if one should ask by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority men are bound to be honest and sincere; and to prefer Gods Laws before mens? For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requires from the Members of her Communion, besides matters of Faith, such acts of Worship, which, whatever they be, to those who believe as they do, must be <hi>Idolatrous</hi> to those that believe as we do. For example, suppose in <hi>China</hi> where they believe <hi>God</hi> to be the same with the <hi>World,</hi> that honour of the <hi>Chineses</hi> (who on that account think they may lawfully give Divine Worship to any part of the World) to be converted by the <hi>Missionaries,</hi> who tell them the parts of the World cannot be God, for he is Infinite and Immutable, and Wise, and Powerful, which the Parts of the World are not, and cannot be, and therefore they cannot without Idolatry give Divine Worship to them; the <hi>Mandarins</hi> require their giving the same <hi>Adorations</hi> that others do; they refuse and say, Whatever you may do, who believe God and the World to be the same, certainly it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107642:36"/>
would be gross Idolatry in us, who believe the thing you worship, to be nothing but dull insensible parts of the World. And if now it should be asked, By what authority they separate? Is there not a plain answer, By the authority of God himself, who requires A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration to be given to himself alone?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But who shall be Judg,</hi> saith the Defender? God himself will be <note place="margin">Pag. 43.</note> Judg a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the great Day, whether we will or not. And I think that is more to be regarded, than putting an end to Controversies. If we be not sincere and faithful to him and his service, if we do not act and judg with a regard to the Judgment of that day, all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences in the world of a Judg in Controversies, then will stand in no stead. If we do use our careful endeavours to know the will of God, and to do it, we have great reason to hope God will shew mercy to us; and then the Question will not appear of such wonderful importance, <hi>Who shall be Judg here?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we do not decline a reasonable Judgment in this world; we only desire our Judges may be fair and equal, and such as God hath appointed. And if those who would judg for us, pretend that they have a Divine Commission, we desire to know who shall be judg of this pretence? We have no reason to trust them; and they will not trust us. So that here we are stopt at first, unless the Commission be produced, which impowers those persons to judg, who challenge such authority over our judgments. A general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite obscure Commission, which may extend to all other Guides in the Church as well as to them, will by no means be sufficient. Let us see whom Christ hath appointed in his own words, and we will submit; for we look on him as Supreme Judg and Legislator to his Church; and if he hath thought fit to appoint an Infallible Judg, we have done. But we desire to know where he hath done it? Hath he granted any new Commission from Heaven? No. Is it to be found in Scripture? Yes. But then I pray observe, you tell us Scripture cannot be Judg in any Controversie, being ambiguous, uncertain, general, mute, flexible, and what not? and because it cannot hear Parties, nor give a decisive voice, it can by no means be a Judg of Controversies. How then can the Scripture put an end to this Controversie, when it can put an end to none? Are the Expressions in this matter so particular, so clear, so peremptory, that we cannot mistake about the sense of them? If so, then I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, notwithstanding all the hard words given it, Scripture may be Judg as well as a Rule, because it is fitted to put an end to such
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107642:37"/>
a Controversie, which is as doubtful as any; and why not as well to all the rest? We are not then afraid of this Question, <hi>Who shall be Judg?</hi> But we desire to be satisfied about it; and to know not only who hath appointed him, but who he is, whether the Pope <hi>in Cathedr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To say <hi>the Council is infallible, when confirmed by the Pope,</hi> is Nonsense. For, either it was Infallible in its Decree, or not. If not, it can borrow no Infallibility from the Popes subsequent Confirmation; but the Popes Judgment may be said to be Infallible, but by no means the Councils.

               <p>I had given a fair account of the proceedings in <hi>England</hi> upon the Reformation, how the search began, the Popes Authority to be discarded, and the Articles of Religion to be drawn up, which ought not to be looked on as particular Fancies, but the sense of our Church.</p>
               <p>All this he calls <hi>a pleasing dream;</hi> I am sure the pretence of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is so; but I related matter of fact, which he hath no mind to meddle with, but he runs again to his, <hi>Who shall be Judg?</hi> And concludes, <hi>that I think between Churches there's none at all.</hi> I <note place="margin">Pag 45.</note> do think the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this divided state of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, is under no Superior Judicature, but that it hath sufficient power and authority to reform abuses, and to declare Articles of Religion so as to oblige its Members to Conformity; especially since it proceeds by such excellent Rules, as the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> the ancient Councils and Universal Tradition.

Well then, how is it their Church was <hi>in possession</hi> of those Truths? Do they become <hi>Truths</hi> by their possession, or only that they were <hi>Truths</hi> they were then possessed of? If so, he must first prove them to be <hi>Truths,</hi> or the <hi>Possession</hi> signifies nothing And that is the point I went upon, that no <hi>Possession</hi> gives a right to <hi>Truth;</hi> but the Church of <hi>England</hi> had just reason to examine whether these were <hi>Truths</hi> or not; and upon examination finding them to be otherwise, it had reason to reject them.</p>

yet because this goes a great way with some people, I do not only deny the truth of it, but shall give evident proof to the contrary.</p>
               <p>For I suppose it will not be questioned, that the Religion brought in here <hi>by Augustin</hi> and his Companions, was the Religion of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the Great;</hi> I shall therefore compare the Doctrine of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> with that of <hi>Gregory,</hi> in some remarkable Paticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and shew the great Difference between them as to these things.

The Replier saith, <hi>We ought to bring positive Texts for our negative Articles; as no Praying to Saints, no Purgatory, no Worship of Images, no Transubstantiation, and the like; with which,</hi> he saith, <hi>the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles are stuft.</hi> But why must we be obliged to bring <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>To answer this, Let us suppose the Common Council of the City should agree to make men swear that the Monument near <hi>London Bridge,</hi> is a living creature, and should exclude all those from the City Priviledges who do not; and that others having examin'd the Monument, and found nothing but Stones and Iron, were resolved to follow their Senses, and declare their minds, That upon due consideration, they did judg the Monument to be no living creature; Would any say, these men ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e it an Article of their Faith, when they only rejected a false proposition imposed upon the Faith of others? Why may not a Church declare what it doth not believe, as well as what it doth? And when it declares what it doth not believe, doth it make such declarations Articles of Faith? The plain case is, Those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> impose things we think as hard and unreasonable as the former Example: Our Church not only denies its belief of them; but signifies it to its Members by a body of Articles which they are to sign, to testifie their consent: How doth this come to make every one of these Declarations an Article of Faith? They are only Articles of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not of Faith. And the difference between these may be easily understood. <hi>An Article of Faith</hi> supposes <hi>a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> as the Replier yields; but if men offer that for a Divine Revelation, which is not, the rejecting of that cannot be called an Article of Faith; because there is no need of Revelation to declare the other to be none, supposing there be a Rule to judg what is of Divine Revelation, and what not. That Rule we say is the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> not interpreted by Fancy, but by the Primitive Church; by this Rule so interpreted, we reject <hi>Invocation of Saints, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Worship of Images, Transubstantiation,</hi> &amp;c. And why then should our rejecting them, be called so many Articles of Faith? We own the Scripture for our Rule, and for our compleat and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate Rule of Faith; and therefore it serves us both for what we
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107642:42"/>
are to believe, and what we are not to believe. In positive Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, we resolve our Faith into Divine Revelation contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; in Negative, the Article of Faith is, <hi>That Scripture is our Rule;</hi> but from thence it is a necessary Consequence of Reason. That we are not to believe any thing but what is contained in Scripture, or may be deduced from thence. Which deductions being within the force of the Rule, are not to be looked on as different from it; and what can neither be proved by Scripture, nor by deductions from it, if our Principle be allowed, we can never be blamed if we reject it. For otherwise we should not act reasonably, nor agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our own Principles.</p>
               <p>But as to the Particulars mentioned, we do not meerly reject them as not contained in Scripture, but as repugnant to such Principles concerning Divine Worship.

               <p>It was answered, That the Advantage of the Clergy lay plainly on the other side; which is yielded by the Replier; and yet he would have <hi>the Clergy byast:</hi> What, byast against their Interest?

               <p>In answer it was said, That either this respects the several Sects of Dissenters from the Religion established by Law, and then it seems hard, considering a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> circumstances, to charge the Church of <hi>England</hi> with them; or it takes in all that dissent from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so it is a charge on the whole Church since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as guilty of <hi>Heresie;</hi> which was a charge I said could never be made good.</p>
               <p>The Defender avoids the charge as to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but the Replier in plain terms owns it; saying, <hi>That establishment
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107642:42"/>
of a Religion by Law, cannot protect it from being a Heresie;</hi> which I <note place="margin">Reply, p. 29.</note> readily grant. And then he adds. <hi>Let him defend his own, and his work is done.</hi> The best way to do that, is to consider first what <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi> is, and that I said was <hi>an obstinate opposing some necessary Article of Faith;</hi> and then, how it comes to be in the Power of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>define Heretical Doctrines,</hi> so as that any Doctrine comes to be <hi>Heresie,</hi> by being contrary to its Definitions?</p>
               <p>He answers, <hi>By the same way the Church had Power in her General Councils, to make Creeds, and to Anathematize Hereti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that whatever Power the Catholick Church exercised in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring Matters of Faith, he challenges as of Right belonging to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which wholly depends on the first Point already discussed; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Catholick Church</hi> are the same</p>
               <p>But I shall now wave that, and consider, Whether if that were allow'd, the Church could now have the same Reason to declare the Points in difference to be Heresies, as the Primitive Church had the Doctrines of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and <hi>Incarnation of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am of opinion it cannot; and yet if it could, that alone is not sufficient to charge <hi>Heresie</hi> upon us.</p>
               <p>And in making out of both these, I shall argue from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Heresie,</hi> as it is stated among their best Writers, who agree that there are three Things necessary to make up the charge of <hi>Heresie.</hi> 1. The Nature of the Proposition. 2. The Authority of the Proponent. 3. The obstinacy of the Party.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Nature of the Proposition; for it is allowed among them, that there is a difference between a <hi>Proposition Erroneous in Faith,</hi> and <hi>Heretical.</hi>

               <p>But for our better understanding this matter, I shall set down something very pertinently observed by <hi>Aquinas</hi> and others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith, <hi>That Faith in us depends upon Divine Revelation, not such as is made to any person, but that which was made to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, which is preserved in the Canonical Books; and therefore</hi> he saith, <hi>the proofs from Scripture are necessary and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; those from other Authorities are but probable:</hi> Which is a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of great Consequence in this matter; for from hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that whatsover Article of Faith is made necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, must be proved from <hi>Scripture;</hi> and <hi>Heresie</hi> being an obstinate opposing a necessary Article of Faith, there can be no <hi>Heresie,</hi> where the Doctrine is not founded on Scripture: And elsewhere he makes <hi>the principles of Faith to be the Authorities of the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:107642:43"/>
2. That all matters of Faith are not equally revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>For some,</hi> he saith, <hi>are principally designed, as the Trinity and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>q.</hi> 32. <hi>art.</hi> 4</note> 
                  <hi>Incarnation; and these are directly against Faith; and to hold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them,</hi> especially <hi>with obstinacy, is Heresie; but there are others which are indirectly against Faith; from whence something follows which overthrows Faith; as, for any one to deny that</hi> Samuel <hi>was the son of Helcanah, the consequence would be, that the Scripture was false.</hi>
               </p>

That a sufficient Proposition of a matter of Faith is not barely to deliver it <hi>as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Trath,</hi> but it must be done with such <hi>circumstances,</hi> that it may appear to be <hi>prudently credible, i. e.</hi> so as to see such reason for it, as to put him beyond doubt or fear of the contrary. 2. That it must appear <hi>evidently credible</hi> to be revealed by God, and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible. 3. That it must appear not only so, but <hi>evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more credible,</hi> than the Doctrine repugnant to it. 4. That accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to natural reason, the assent to it is to be prefer'd before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion. Now to make good the charge of <hi>Heresie</hi> against our Church, he must not bring <hi>the Motives of Credibility</hi> for the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107642:44"/>
                  <hi>Christian Faith</hi> in general, which are owned on both sides; but as to those points which are asserted by them as matters of Faith, and rejected by us. As for instance, <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is declared by them to be <hi>a matter of Faith;</hi> and it is denied by us; and they charge us with <hi>Heresie</hi> for it. We say, it hath never been proposed to us in such a manner, as to make it appear to be a prudent judgment in us to believe it, or that it was ever revealed by God or more credible than the contrary opinion, in the judgment of Reason. Not any one of these things doth appear to us, but the contrary; for we can see nothing of the Credibility, but a great deal for the <hi>evident Incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of it. How then can this matter of Faith be said to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proposed to us?</p>
               <p>It may be said, <hi>all this is done by the Authority of the Church propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it; and if it be made evidently credible that you ought to believe the Church, then we are Hereticks for rejecting her Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, That if by the <hi>Churches Authority,</hi> be meant that of the <hi>Roman Catholick Churches Infallible proposing</hi> matters of Faith to us, we are as far to seek as ever and for our hearts we cannot find this made out with any degree of <hi>Credibility.</hi> We have searched all your Grounds, examined your Motives, weighed your Reasons, your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles we have not seen) but we can meet with nothing that should make it a prudent judgment for us to take all matters of Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trust from her. And if there be no <hi>Evidence of Credibility,</hi> there is no sufficient proposal; and if there be not, there can be no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to believe; and where that is not, there can be no <hi>Heresie</hi> in not believing, according to the judgment of your greatest Divines.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) As to the charge of <hi>Heresie,</hi> there must be <hi>obstinacy in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> which they all make necessary to <hi>formal Heresie.</hi>

               <p n="4">(4) That it is not yet necessary in order to this <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> to believe the Church to have <hi>Infallible Authority,</hi> for then those must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused from <hi>heretical Obstinacy</hi> who denied it: but it is sufficient that the <hi>Church</hi> is proposed as a true Church, whose <hi>Authority</hi> he is bound to submit to.</p>
               <p>The short of all this matter is, If a Man resolve to believe as the Church believes, a very small thing will excuse him from <hi>Heresy:</hi> but if not, nothing according to <hi>Suarez</hi> will do it: unless it be <hi>Ignorance</hi> as to the Churches proposing. And this is the modern notion of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy,</hi> which appears to me, to be very unreasonable on these accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Suppose a Person have a general Disposition of mind to believe whatever is sufficiently proposed to him, as revealed by God, and believes sincerely whatever he knows to be contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

If it be, then none can be convinced of <hi>heretical Obstinacy,</hi> but such as reject the Churches Authority, when they believe it Infallible; and then none of us can be

               <p n="3">(3) Suppose a Person thinks himself bound in Conscience to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve those Guides which God by his Providence hath set over him; and he believes to be sincere and honest: and these tell him, there is no ground to believe on the Churches Authority, as being sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither in Scripture, nor Antiquity, nor Reason, is not he excused hereby from <hi>Heretical Obstinacy?</hi>

Suppose he declares himself ready to believe the Churches Authority, if it be sufficiently proposed to him; <hi>i. e.</hi> with such Reasons and Arguments as are proper to convince him; but after all, he declares, that he cannot see any such.

               <p n="5">(5.) Suppose he doth believe that which the Church proposes, not meerly upon its <hi>Authority,</hi> but upon the <hi>Reasons</hi> which the Church offers; why must this man be liable to <hi>Heretical Obstinacy,</hi> for believing upon the Churches Reasons? What a wonderful nice thing is <hi>Heresie</hi> made? It seems by this rare Doctrine, it doth not excuse from <hi>Heresie</hi> to believe even Truth it self, if it be upon grounds of Reason which the Church it self gives. But it must be taken meerly from the <hi>Churches Authority;</hi> and yet that very Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority must be believed on the grounds of Reason, or the <hi>Motives of Gredibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Suppose a Person hath used the best means he could to find out his Obligation to believe on the Churches Authority, and after all, he cannot find any such thing, what Obligation is he under to enquire farther; and from whence doth it arise? And if he be not under any, how can he be guilty of <hi>Herecial Obstinacy,</hi> who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no <hi>Obligation</hi> to search any farther?

Suppose he be willing to believe on the <hi>Churches Authority,</hi> if that Church be made appear to him to be the <hi>One Catholick Church</hi> of Christ, but when he comes to examine this, he finds that he must exclude very great and considerable Parts of the Catholick Church, to reduce the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Catholick Church to that of

the <hi>Roman Communion;</hi> how can it then be <hi>Heretical Obstinacy</hi> not to suppose a <hi>Part</hi> to be the <hi>Whole?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">(8.) Suppose he hath overcome this, yet if he should mistake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Seat of Infallibility, is he not still as liable to the charge of <hi>Heretical Obstinacy,</hi> because the true Reason of it is, that such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son rejects that which God hath chosen as the proper means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound matters of Faith to us: But if he should be mistaken in the true Proponent, he is in as much danger of <hi>Heretical Obstinacy</hi> still. As suppose a man takes a General Council, as representing the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> to be the only <hi>true Proponent of Faith;</hi> and therefore rejects the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> in this matter, I desire to know, whether this be <hi>Heretical Obstinacy,</hi> or not? If not, then rejecting the true Proponent, doth not make any liable to it: If it doth, then there is <hi>Heretical Obstinacy</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as out of it. And so much in Answer to the Repliers Charge of <hi>Heresie</hi> on the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The next Charge relates to the <hi>Insufficient Authority of the Church of</hi> England, and that on these Accounts:</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) In that it leaves every man to judge for himself.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Because she dares not use the true Arguments against Sects, for fear of their being turned upon her self.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Because she denies an Appeal to an higher Judicature.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It is urged in the Papers, <hi>That among us every man thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as competent a Judg of Scripture, as the very Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was answer'd, That every man among us doth not pretend to an Infallible Spirit, but all yield the Apostles had it. And by being a Judg of Scripture, if no more be meant, than that every man must use his Understanding about it, that was no more than was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in order to the believing the matters contained in it: But if by being a Judg of Scripture, was meant, giving such a Judgment as obliges others to submit to it, then it was denied, that every man among us is allow'd to judg of it. But yet we own the Authority of the Guides of the Church, and a due submission to them; but we do not allow them to be as competent Judges of Scriptures as the very Apostles.</p>
               <p>This seems to me to be a full and clear Answer.</p>
               <p>But the Replier offers some things against it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>That I suppose Men cannot be deceived in understanding the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> p. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Scriptures; and consequently their Spirit is infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I never said, or thought, that they could not be deceived; but I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they must use their Understandings, to prevent being deceived,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107642:47"/>
and must judg of the sense of what they are to believe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in order to their own Salvation.</p>
               <p>But he saith, <hi>Whosoever uses his Understanding in opposition to the Churches Tradition, makes himself a Judg indeed, but not to his own Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make this matter clear, we must consider, <hi>That Matters of Faith necessary to Salvation,</hi> are of another nature from <hi>Matters of Controversie concerning the Sense of Scripture</hi> in doubtful places.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>matters necessary to Salvation to particular persons,</hi> we assert the Scriptures to be so plain, and the Tradition of the Church as to the Creeds, so well known and attested, that no man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gross and culpable neglect, can mistake about them; but in case of invincible or unaffected ignorance, their Errors shall not be laid to their charge, and so their mistakes shall not hinder their Salvation: And herein we assert no more than we can justifie, not only from Scripture, Reason, and Antiquity, but from the best of their own Writers, who assert,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there are some Points of Faith necessary to be explicitely believed by all in order to Salvation; for altho they say there may be such invincible ignorance of them, as may excuse from sin in not believing them; yet without believing them, they are not capable of Salvation. As to the <hi>prima credibilia,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas</hi> calls them, he determines, <hi>That every man is bound to believe them explicitely,</hi> as much as he is bound to have Faith; but as to other things, <hi>a</hi>

                  <hi>preparation of mind is sufficient to believe all contained in Scripture, and so much explicitely, as is made plain to him to he contained therein.</hi> From whence it follows, That by the Doctrine of the <hi>Schools,</hi> every man is to judg what he is to believe; for his Words are, <hi>Quando hoc ei constiterit,</hi> when it is made clear to him; and how can any thing be made clear to a man unless he be the Judg of it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That particular persons may certainly know what is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their Salvation by the inward assistance of Divine Grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">

So that the greatest Divines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do yield all we contend for, as to the Matters necessary to Salvation.</p>
               <p>The only Question is about <hi>Matters of Controversie</hi> raised in the Church concerning the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture;</hi> and as to these they yield these material Points:</p>

(1) That an Implicit Faith as to what is contained in Scripture, is sufficient; and that particular persons are bound to no more, till the Doctrine be made clear to them, which appears from the words of <hi>Aquinas</hi> lately mentioned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That particular Persons may disbelieve many things deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Church, without sin.

               </p>
               <p>Let us now lay these things to the present Case, and all the Difficulty will soon disappear.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Matters of Salvation,</hi> they grant that God will not suffer those to be deceived about them, who do sincerely seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the knowledg of them.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Matters of Controversie,</hi> they are in no danger, if they trust their <hi>Spiritual Guides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I asserted that we owned the Authority of Guides in the Church, and a due submission to them.</p>
               <p>But the Replier is not satisfied with this, for he saith,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That no other submission is sufficient, but such as men lose I haven without it.</hi> This is somewhat hard to understand: Doth he in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest think men cannot go to Heaven without a blind Obedience to the Church? Is there no allowance to be made for Ignorance, Education, reasonable Doubts? Is all other submission to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church merely <hi>ad Pompam?</hi> But this Gentleman did not take time to consider the Doctrine of their own <hi>Schools</hi> about these matters, for I cannot imagine he could be ignorant of it.</p>
               <p>But the Defender seems to be wholly unacquainted with it, otherwise he could not talk so crudely and unskilfully as he doth, about <hi>mens Judgment in matters that concern their Salvation.</hi> And <note place="margin">Def. p. 49.</note> he may now see how far their own <hi>Divines</hi> allow particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be competent Judges about matters that relate to their own Salvation: and therefore I need give him no other Answer, till he hath better informed himself about these things: but we have been upon such a Point as may in some measure excuse him, but not those who ought to understand their own Doctrine better.</p>

(2.) The next Argument to prove <hi>the Insufficient Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> was, <hi>That she dares not bring the true Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments against the other Sects, for fear they should be turned against themselves, and confuted by their own Arguments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this it was answered, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> did wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disown the pretence of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and made use of the best Arguments against Sectaries from a just Authority, and the Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Folly of the Sectaries refusing to submit to it.</p>
               <p>To take off the force of this Answer, two different Ways are taken.</p>

               <p>But the Force of this depends upon a double Mistake.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath as much Authority over our Church, as the Rulers of it have over the Members. Which ought not to have been supposed, but substantially proved, since the Weight of the Cause depends upon it. But I see nothing like a Proof produced.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That the Sectaries have as much reason to reject the Terms of Communion required by our Church, as our Church had to reject those of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But this is as far from being proved as the other.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Defender <hi>desires to be instructed, how such an Authority can be in a Church without Infallibility?</hi> I hope he believes there may be <hi>Authority</hi> without <hi>Infallibility;</hi> or else how shall Fathers govern their Children? <hi>But not in the Church.</hi> Why so? Have not Bishops, out of Councils, Authority to rule their Diocesses? Have they not a <hi>Provincial Synods</hi> Authority to make <hi>Canons,</hi> tho they be not Infallible? What then is the meaning of this? He tells us soon after; <hi>To say a Church is Fallible, is to say she may be deceived.</hi> There is no doubt of that. <hi>And if she may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her self, they may be deceived who follow her.</hi> And if a Church pretends to be Infallible, which is not, she certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives those that follow her, and that without Remedy. But all
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107642:49"/>
this sort of Reasoning, proceeds upon a false Suggestion, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Faith must be grounded on the Chuach's Authority as the <hi>formal Reason</hi> of it. Which he knows, is utterly denied by us, and ought to have been proved. We declare, <hi>the Ground of our Faith</hi> is <hi>the Word of God;</hi> not interpreted by Fancy, but by the Consent of the whole Christian Church from the Apostles Times. This is our Bottom, or if you will, <hi>the Rock,</hi> on which our Church is built. This is far more firm and durable, than a pretence to Infallibility; which is like a desperate Remedy, which Men never run to, but when they see nothing else will help them. Had the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> been able to defend her Innovations by Reason or Antiquity, she had never thought of Infallibility. It is a much better expedient to keep Men in Error, than to keep them from it; and tends more to save the Authority of a sinking. Church, than the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>But he will not let the Church's Infallibility go thus; For he pretends to prove, <hi>that if we take that away, we make Christianity the most unreasonable Thing in Nature; nay, absolutely impossible.</hi> What! whether God hath promised to make the Church Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or not! We understand those who offer to prove the Church Infallible by Scripture; but these <hi>Scientifical Men</hi> despise such beaten Roads, and when they offer to demonstrate, fall short of the others Probabilities. As will appear by examining his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Faith requires an assent to a thing as absolutely true; but a fallible Authority cannot oblige me to a thing as absolutely true;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 52.</note> 
                  <hi>and therefore this would be an Effect without a Cause; a down-right Impossibility; a flat Contradiction.</hi> I will match his Argument with another; Faith is not an Assent to a thing as absolutely true, upon less than a Divine Testimony; but the Church's Testimony is not Divine; and therefore to believe upon the Church's Testimony, is an Effect without a Cause; a down-right Impossibility; a flat Contradiction.</p>
               <p>Let him set one of these against the other, and see who makes Faith unreasonable or impossible. But I will clear this Matter in few words. I grant that Faith is an Assent to a thing as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely true; and that what is absolutely true, is impossible to be false: I grant, that a meer fallible Authority is not sufficient to produce an Act of Faith. But here I distinguish the Infallible Authority of God revealing (into which my Faith is resolved, as into the formal Reason of it) from the Authority of the Church conveying that Revelation, which is only the Means by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107642:49"/>
which this Revelation comes to be known to us: As when a Man swears by the Bible, there is a difference between the Contents of that Book by which he swears, and the Officers putting the Book into his hands.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The Church of <hi>England</hi> is blamed, <hi>for allowing no Liberty of Appeals to a higher Judicature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Question is, Whether this makes her no true Church; or not to have any just Authority over her own Members?</p>
               <p>The Replier saith, <hi>She makes her self the last Tribunal of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I know not where she hath done so, since we own the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Free and truly General Councils, as the Supreme Tribunal of the Church upon Earth. And accordingly receive the four first; which even <hi>S. Gregory the Great</hi> distinguished from those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as to their Authority and Veneration.</p>
               <p>The Defender had a good mind <hi>to cut off the Church of</hi> England <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 54.</note> 
                  <hi>from being a Church,</hi> because she hath renounced Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but his heart failed him: And I hope he will think better of it, when he sees cause to prove a little more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in its largest extent is <hi>the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He argues, <hi>That there must be such an Authority in a Church, which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 55.</note> 
                  <hi>may give a final Sentence conclusive to the Parties, as the Judges do Temporal Differences.</hi> But is it necessary for all Churches to have such a Power? then there must be as many Supreme Courts as there are Churches. If not, we desire to know where the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Court is, and who appointed it? And where Christ hath ever promised to his Church a Power to end Controversies when they arise, as effectually as Judges do Temporal Differences? For the freest and most General Councils yet assembled, have not been so happy; and those we look on as the most Venerable Authority to decide Differences in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But still our Church wants sufficient Authority,</hi> in his Opinion. <note place="margin">Page 56.</note> Doth it want Authority to govern its own Members? To Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Abuses in a divided State of the Catholick Church? To cast off an usurped Power, as it was judged by the Clergy in Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, who yet concurred in other things with the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> I pray what Authority had the <hi>Gallican Church</hi> so lately to declare against <hi>the Pope's Infallibility,</hi> and to reduce him in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Case of an ordinary Bishop?

                  <hi>Temporal Princes</hi> in other Countries, sometimes to forbid, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to restrain and limit the <hi>Pope's Bulls.</hi> This at least shews, that there may be just Authority to examine and restrain the Pope's Power. And I see no Reason, why the several Churches of Christendom may not act as well against the Pretence of the <hi>Pope's Authority,</hi> as the Gallican Church hath done against his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility;</hi> especially, since this Gentleman hath told us, <hi>that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority without Infallibility, signifies nothing.</hi> And those who think they may examine and reject his Dictates, may do the same by his Authority, the one being as liable as the other.</p>
               <p>It was said in the Papers, <hi>That no Country can subsist in Quiet, where there is not a Supreme Judg, from whom there can be no Appeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Answer was, That the natural Consequence was then, that every National Church ought to have the Supreme Power within it self. But how comes Appeals to a Foreign Jurisdiction to tend to the Peace and Quiet of a Church?</p>
               <p>The Defender saith; <hi>That a National to the whole Church, is but</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 57.</note> 
                  <hi>as a Shire to a Kingdom; and a very natural and consistent Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it is, that every Shire should have a King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One would think by such an Answer, this Defender is a mighty Stranger to the ancient Polity of the Church. Did he never hear of the Power of <hi>Metropolitans</hi> being setled by the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> for governing the Churches, and calling <hi>Provincial Synods?</hi> Did he never hear of many other <hi>Canons</hi> relating to the Power and Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of <hi>Provincial Synods?</hi> Did he never hear of the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> forbidding all Incroachments <hi>on the ancient Rights of Churches?</hi> Did he never hear that <hi>Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> have declared Matters of Faith, without so much as advising with the Bishop of <hi>Rome?</hi> As the African Councils did in the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian Controversy;</hi> and the Councils of <hi>Tolcdo,</hi> in the Case of <hi>Arianism;</hi> which reformed the <hi>Spanish Churches,</hi> and made Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons by their own Authority; which were confirmed by their Kings, <hi>Reccaredus</hi> and <hi>Sisenandus?</hi> Did he never hear that it was good Doctrine among Cathol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ck Divines, <hi>That particular Churches might take upon them to declare the true Catholick Faith?</hi> And if so, they must judg what is so. Did he never hear, that in a divided State of the Church, <hi>Errors and Abuses may be reformed by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches?</hi> And that this was owned and defended by great Men in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> if he did not, he was very much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided for the handling such a Controversy; if he did know these things, he ought not to have spoken with so much
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107642:51"/>
contempt of the Power of Particular or National Churches.</p>
               <p>And to assert their Authority, is very far from being like <hi>setting up a King in every Shire;</hi> for this were the highest Dilloyalty to the King, who hath a just and unquestionable Authority over all the Shires. Let him prove that the Pope hath such a <hi>Monarchy</hi> over all <hi>particular Churches,</hi> before he make such a Parallel again. But the way he takes is rather like making the Imperial Crown of this Realm to be in subjection to a Foreign Power, because the Roman Emperors once had Dominion here, and therefore this Kingdom could never recover its own Rights.</p>
               <p>But he saith, <hi>A Foreign Jurisdiction is hardly sense with respect to</hi>

                  </gap>oris <hi>is out, and unless the ultimate Jurisdiction be out of the Church, it cannot be said to be foreign.</hi> This is a shameful begging of the Question, that what they call the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> is the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> for if it be not (which I hope I have sufficiently shewn) then the pretended and usurped Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> over the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is a <hi>Foreign Jurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He adds, <hi>That it is impossible to re-settle the Church among us, without that which we call Foreign Jurisdiction; because Dissentions in</hi>

               <p>I complained of the Inconvenience of Appeals to a Foreign Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction. He gives us a smart Answer, and saith, <hi>That holds no comparison with the Inconvenience of Heresy.</hi> As tho it were so plain <note place="margin">Pag. 59.</note> a thing that we are guilty of Heresy, that it needed no manner of proof. Alas! what need a Man prove that it is day when the sun shines? We are just as much guilty of <hi>Heresy,</hi> as the good Bishop was, who, for denying the Antipodes, was condemned by Pope <hi>Zach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107642:52"/>
                  <hi>Pope</hi> is owned as <hi>Head of the Church:</hi> And then all those Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences will follow I mentioned before. If other kind of <hi>Appeals</hi> were meant in the <hi>Papers,</hi> yet they must relate to <hi>an Authority Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to our Church;</hi> which we could wish had been more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, that we might have known to whom the <hi>Appeal</hi> was to be made; whether to a <hi>free General Council,</hi> which we never disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or to the <hi>Popes Authority,</hi> which we yet see no cause to make our Appeals to, especially as to what concerns his own Jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>He pleads, <hi>That Supream Power must be Judg in its own Cause; for no Authority ought to be set up against the King, supposing a Question</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 52.</note> 
                  <hi>be started about his Prerogative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; This is a Case extreamly different: for in matters of <hi>Prerogative,</hi> the King's Supream Power is not the Question; for his Right to the Imperial Crown is, and ought to be out of dispute; but all the Question that can be started, must relate only to the Exercise of his Power, in some particular Cases, where former Laws made by the King's Consent, are supposed to limit it; which the Courts of Judicature take Cognizance of, and so are a kind of Legal Arbitrators between the King and his People.</p>
               <p>But in the Case before us, the Jurisdiction it self, and the Right to exercise any such Authority, is the very thing in Question. And I desire this Gentleman to resolve me, whether in the late times of Usurpation this had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> been good Doctrine, that those who enjoy, or pretend to Supream Power, are to be Judges in their own Case? If so, then it had been impossible for Men to have justified their Loyalty to the Royal Family, then very unjustly put out of possession. If not, then there may be a pretence to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority, where it is by no means allowable for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender to Judg in his own Cause.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>his Appeal to the Catholick Church;</hi> we by no means reject it, provided he mean the Church truly Catholick, as it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends <note place="margin">Pag. 63.</note> the Apostolical Church in the first place; and then all other Christian Churches, which from the Apostles times have delivered down the Catholick Doctrine and Worship, which they received from them. But if he means that which is called a <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but is neither Catholick nor Apostolical; we beg his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, if we allow no Appeal to it, since its Errors and Corruptions are the great and just Cause of our Complaints.</p>
               <p>He runs into a long Discourse about <hi>Church-Security,</hi> and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is to shew <hi>there can be none without Infallibility.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 64, 65.</note>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:107642:52"/>
Infallibility is no doubt a very good thing, but where is it to be had? Is it not possible for Men both to be deceived and to deceive, with a pretence of Infallibility? All that we desire is to see some Infallible Prooss of it; without which all the talk about it doth not end one Controversy, but beget many. And this kind of Talk is, as if a Man were to advise with two Lawyers about making a Purchase, but would fain be secure of a good Title; the one desires to see all the Evidences that belong to the Estate, and after the perusal of all, he tells him, that as far as he can possibly discern, the Title is very good, and he would venture all he had upon it. He goes to another, and tells him what the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer had said to him. And was this all, saith he? Would he not say, it was impossible for you to be cheated? No. And will you venture your Money without such Security? Why, saith the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, what would you have me to do? I will tell you, saith he, there is but one way in the World for you to be safe. What is that, Sir. I should be glad to know it with all my Heart? I will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to you, provided you follow my Counsel; and that is, to deal with a Man who hath such a Gift from Heaven bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he never did, nor ever can deceive you, and then it is impossible you should be cheated: for, all these Deeds and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and Lawyers, may deceive you; but if you deal with such a Man, you are safe enough. I thank you, Sir, saith the Client, for your good Advice; but I pray, where is there such a Man to be found? For, if I cannot find him out, I am just where I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and I must use the best means I can, and rather trust to good Deeds and real Honesty, than wait for a Chimerical Infallibliity.</p>
               <p>It is alledged still, <hi>That without infallibility, we have not Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 65.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The difference of these must depend upon the Reason we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; and by that we are still content <hi>the World should judg,</hi> so we understand those, who are unprejudiced in it.</p>
               <p>It was said in the Papers, <hi>That if the Fancies of those who are now for the Church of</hi> England <hi>vary, they are ready, or</hi> (as the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sender</hi> saith it ought to be read) <hi>really to embrace or joyn with the next Congregation of People, whose Discipline or Worship agrees with their Opinion at that time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will take his own Reading, which in my Opinion alters the matter very little; for still it implies, That those of the Church
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107642:53"/>
of <hi>England</hi> have nothing to hold them to it, but a present Fancy, and when that varies, they may as well be of another Perswasion; for Fancy, we all know, is a very mutable thing.</p>
               <p>But, to shew that those of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are not so apt to vary their Fancies or Opinions in these matters, I alledged their adhering to the Crown in the times of Rebellion.</p>
               <p>He answers, <hi>That my Zeal for the Church of</hi> England <hi>is wonderous</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 66.</note> 
                  <hi>unlucky.</hi> I am sorry if it prove so, since I unfeignedly design to serve her, and therefore should be much more concerned, if I should do her Injury under a pretence of Service. But wherein is it? He confesses, <hi>The Doctrine of our Church is in this Point very Orthodox, and her Practice in the times of Rebellion conformable to it.</hi> And what was the Practice of the Church then, but the firmness of the Members of it? <hi>But many,</hi> he saith, <hi>deserted Her and her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in this Point at that time, so many that the Rebellion was perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture indebted for its success to those Deserters.</hi> But they were <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serters</hi> still; and the Practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to her Doctrine, by his own Confession. How then comes this to shew, that it is only a variable Fancy which keeps Men to it? He saith, <hi>If those who deserted her, had ever adhered to her with a Perswasion, that they were obliged to believe what sbe taught, they could not have deserted her in this Point, who always taught Loyalty; and till they do so, there is no security of adhering to her.</hi>

               <p>This seems to me to be <hi>a wonderous unlucky Answer.</hi> For doth <hi>Infallibility</hi> secure a Church against <hi>Deserters?</hi> Have no Men, no Provinces, no whole Nations <hi>deserted</hi> a Church which pretends to Infallibility? And since there may be such Multitudes of <hi>Deserters,</hi> where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>inst them, more than our Church doth? Nay, I think so much the less, because the very pretence to Infallibility is suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hard to be made out, and every Error overthrows it. And I do not think the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did her self greater Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ade more total <hi>Deserters</hi> by any one thing, than by pretending to be Infallible. For, when such gross Errors and Corruption; were complained of, that one of the Popes at that time confessed them, and owned the necessity of a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Princes of the Roman Communion called for it, and pressed it very hard by their Ambassadors in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> (as appears by the French Collection of <hi>Memoires</hi> relating to it) when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

they would, they would Reform nothing; this made the Breach irreconcileable. For, till the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was ended and confirmed, there was still hopes of Reconciliation, upon a due Explication of some Points, Reforming Abuses, and leaving School-Doctrines at liberty; but when they saw every thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and the Errors complained of, made Articles of Faith, and put into a New Creed, there was no hopes of any Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation left. And all this was the blessed Effect of pretending to <hi>Infallibility;</hi> for if one Error had been owned, there had been no farther pretending to that.</p>
               <p>It is some comfort however, that our Church is confessed <hi>to teach the Orthodox Doctrine of Loyalty, and her Practice to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable in the worst of Times;</hi> and so I hope it will always be. But it hath been said by some Body, <hi>That we had our Government and Ceremonies from his Church, our Doctrine from</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin; <hi>and that we had nothing peculiar to our Church, but our Doctrine of Non-Resistance; and much good may it do us.</hi> And we hope we shall never fare the worse for it. This might give occasion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Whether the Church which pretends to be Infallible, doth teach it so <hi>Orthodoxly</hi> or not? Or whether those who do think themselves obliged to believe what she teaches, are thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the strictest Principles of Loyalty? But I forbear. It is sufficient to my Purpose to shew, that our Church doth not only teach them, as her own Doctrine; but which is far more effectual, as the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, and of the Primitive Church; which I think ought to have more force on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of Men, than the pretence to Infallibility in any Church in the World.</p>
               <p>But all this while it is said, <hi>There is no firm Motive produced for adhering to the Doctrine of our Church.</hi> And this is repeated over <note place="margin">P. 67, 68.</note> and over: As though there could be any greater Motive in the World, than that our Doctrine is no other than that of Christ and his Apostles. And unless you prove this as to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> all your other <hi>Motives</hi> signify nothing to the real satisfaction of any Man's Conscience. For it is agreed on all hands, that our Religion is a revealed Religion; and that this Revelation was made by Christ and his Apostles: and that this Revelation, as to Matters necessary to Salvation, is contained in the Books of the New Testament. What satisfaction then can it be to any Man's Conscience, to be told, such a Church tells
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107642:54"/>
me this and that, and the other Point were the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles? As will appear by this short Representation. You pretend to no new Revelations of Matter of Doctrine? <hi>No.</hi> You have the Books of this Revelation? <hi>Yes.</hi> Are they not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible? <hi>Yes. But you cannot understand them.</hi> Let me try; It is for God's sake I must believe, and therefore I cannot be satisfied till I see his Word. <hi>What! will you not believe the Church which delivers you the Word?</hi> I pray excuse me. A Man brings me a Letter from my Father, about matter of great Consequence to me; he tells me, I need not look into the Letter it self, for he was authorized by my Father to tell me his Meaning: Altho I believe he dealt faithfully in bringing me the true Letter; Do you think I will trust him for the Meaning of it? No; I will open it, if it be only to see, whether he had such Authority from him or not. And I know, if my Father was pleased to write to me about Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of such Importance, he would write in such a manner that I might understand him; and if any Difficulties arise in Point of Law, I will take the Advice of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>se who are most fit and able to direct me. But after all, I must know what my Father would have me to do from his own Words, and not from the Mouth of the Messenger. Or if he tells me he hath Authority to deliver other things by Word of Mouth, not contained in the Letter, which I am equally bound to believe with what I can find in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; can any one think I will believe him, unless it appears by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it self that my Father gave him such Authority? Let him tell me never so much, how long he hath been my Father's Servant, and how faithful he hath been to him, and how much he hath done and suffered for him, and what a number of Certificates he can produce, from time to time, of his good Behaviour; yet all this can give me no satisfaction, as long as the Letter he brings is confessed to be my Father's own Hand-writing; and that it was purposely sent to direct me what I was to do in a Matter that he knew to be of the greatest Concernment in the World to me. Can I imagine one so wise and careful, should omit setting down in his own Letter such important Things, and leave them to the dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Question proceeds upon a Person who in earnest desires to satisfy himself in this Matter; Whether in order to his Salvation, he must follow the Directions of Scripture, or the Church? And I doubt not to make it appear, that the Difficulties are greater about the Church than the Scripture. That which deceives Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is, that they rather consider the Difficulties after the Choice, than before. It is very true, those who trust the Church, have no more to do afterward, but to believe and do as she directs; for they are to examine no farther, whether it be true or false, right or wrong, Vertue or Vice, which is commanded; the Church is to be obey'd. But those who follow the Scripture, must not only read, and weigh, and consider it well; but when Doubts arise, must make fresh Applications to their Rule, and use the best Means for understanding it, by Prayer, Meditation, and the Assistance of Spiritual Guides. And this is far more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Design of the Christian Religion, as it was taught by Christ and his Apostles.</p>
               <p>But the Difficulties of the Choice are now to be consider'd; and let us consider what those are about the Church, and then compare them with those about the Scripture.</p>
               <p>If I choose a Church for my Infallible Guide in the Way to Heaven, to which the Promises of Christ do belong, then there are these Difficulties, both which I think impossible for my mind to get over.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) I must exclude all other Churches in the Christian World from any share in these Promises. And either I must condemn them without hearing them, or examining the Grounds of their Exclusion, or I must be satisfied with the Reason of it; which I cannot be, till I am certain that Church hath justly shut out all other Churches, and challenged the Promises to her self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) I must be satisfied that Christ did intend one standing Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church to be my Director in the Way to Heaven. And for this purpose, I must examine all the places of Scripture produced to that end, and be Judg of the clearness and evidence of them, <hi>i. e.</hi> I must conquer the Difficulties about the Scripture, as to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Translation, and Sense, before I can be satisfied that I am to make choice of a Church.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) There is yet a harder Point to get over; Suppose a Church must be chosen: why the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> rather than any other?
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107642:56"/>
What is there in the Promises of Christ, which direct me to chuse that Church and no other? Suppose I were born in <hi>Greece,</hi> and there I was told, I must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n. If it must be so, I will chuse our own <hi>Greek Church; No, it must be the Church of Rome.</hi> What Reason or Colour is there for it? Is it said so in Scripture? <hi>No, not expresly.</hi> But what Consequence from Scripture will make me do it? <hi>There are Promises made to the Church.</hi> What then? Were not our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches planted by the Apostles? Have not we had a constant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Bishop; in them? Have we not four Patriarchs in our Communion, and you but one? For what imaginable Reason then should you exclude our Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es from any share in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Christ?</p>
               <p>But now as to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> we are to consider;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That no more is necessary as to particular Persons than knowing the things necessary to their Salvation; which are easy to be known, and are clearly revealed in Scripture, if S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine</hi> may be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lieved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That what Difficulties are objected about the Scripture, must be all of them resolved by him that believes the Church, (as is already observed) but the Difficulties about the Church's Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, do not concern him that relies on Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the general Consent of the Christian Church, is of far greater Advantage for the satisfaction of a Man's Mind, than the Authority of any one Church, as about the Integrity of the Copies, and the Canon of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As to Translations, the Unlearned in all Churches must trust to those that are Learned for the particular examination of them; but in general, a private Person may be satisfied by these Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>derations.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That Men will not go about to deceive others in a Matter wherein so many are concerned; and in which it is so easy to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any wilful Fraud.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That since the Divisions of Christendom, there are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties still at watch to discover the Faults committed by each other in a Work of so publick a Nature.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That where a Translation hath been review'd with great care, after several Attempts, there is still greater Security as to the goodness of it. And this is the Case of the present Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church, which was with wonderful care review'd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107642:56"/>
and compared with the Original Languages, by the particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of K. <hi>James</hi> I. and therefore deserves to be esteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove such a Translation, which was never made out of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal (as to the Old Testament) nor ever review'd and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by it. Which is the Case of the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> and of such Translations which are made from it.</p>
               <p>I had said, that the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure may be a Rule without the Church, but the Church cannot without the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The Replier, like a fair Adversary, mentions that which looks like an Objection, <hi>viz. That there was a Church before the Scriptures</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> p. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>were written; and some Ages were passed before the Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was made and owned by the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I Answer; That when I said the Church cannot be a Rule without the Scripture, it was upon the supposition, that the Canon of Scripture had been long since owned by the Church, and that the Church derives its Infallibility from the Promises con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>But the Defender goes another way to work; for, saith he, <hi>The Scriptures, I say, may be a Rule without the Church; that is,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dis.</hi> p. 72.</note> 
                  <hi>without Faithful; for a Congregation of them is a Church.</hi> What! in the Sense now before us, as it is taken for a Guide! Is every Congregation of the Faithful a Church in this Sense? Then, well-fare the Independents. And this, me-thinks, makes Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility sink very low.</p>
               <p>I do not say, <hi>There could be no Church before Scripture;</hi> nor <hi>that they had then no Rule of Faith;</hi> nor <hi>that the Church depends on wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;</hi> these are but mean Objections; but I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill say, That where a Church challenges her Authority by the Scripture, it can signify nothing without it. Which is so plain, that I need not multiply words about it.</p>
               <p>As to his <hi>Church-Security,</hi> we have considered it enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; but it would make one mistrust a <hi>Security</hi> which is so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten offered.</p>
               <p>I said, that suppose Infallibility be found in Scripture, there is yet a harder Point to get over, <hi>viz.</hi> how the Promises relating to the Church in general, came to be appropriated to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

World, that hath very little of true Reasoning in it; but if it were to be found there, it doth not reach to the Point in hand. Doth this imply that I affirmed in the latter part, what I denied before? Is this finding out true Reasoning <hi>in the latter Period, which was not to be found in the former?</hi> There may be true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, when it is not to the purpose. So there might be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not concerned in it. Suppose the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as the <hi>Mother Church,</hi> might be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Promises of Scripture; what would this be to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> But I never said, or thought, that there were any Promises of Infallibility made to any Church in Scripture: Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ises of Divine Assistance and Indefectibility, I grant, are made to the Church in general: but these are quite of another Nature from Promises of Infallibility, in delivering Matters of Faith in all Ages. Yet if this were granted, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it takes in all of her Communion, hath no more reason to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it to her self, than <hi>Europe</hi> hath to be called <hi>the Face of the whole Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to his <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> I tell him in short, He that builds <note place="margin">Pag. 74.</note> his Faith on the Word of God, builds on a Rock; and all other things will be found but <hi>Sandy Foundations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) The next thing laid to our Charge is, <hi>That we draw our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from Implications, and far-fetch'd Interpretations, at the same time that we deny plain and positive words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Answer to this; (1.) It was shew'd, that in many of the Points in Difference, we have express words of Scripture for us. As, against the Worship of Images, and giving Divine Worship to any but God: and for giving the Eucharist in both kinds, and praying in a Language we understand.</p>
               <p>The Defender <hi>would have me produce the very Words, to shew that the Scripture saith No, to what their Church saith I, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 75.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He talked much before, that we give the same Answer the <hi>old Hereticks</hi> did; and now I think he hath matched them. Shew us, say they, in Terms, the direct contrary to our Propositions; where the Son was said to be Consubstantial to the Father; or the Holy Ghost was a Divine Person; or the Blessed Virgin the Mother of God; or that there are two Natures in Christ after the Union. Will Reason and Consequences signify nothing, when founded on the Word of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:107642:57"/>
But I need not this answer, for I assirm that the words of the first and second Commandment, of the Institution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Drink ye all of this;</hi> of S. <hi>Paul</hi> 14. of the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> against Publick Service in an unknown Tongue, are so plain and evident, that there is no Command of Scripture but may be avoided and turned another way as well as these. And herein we go not upon our own Fancies, but we have the concurrent Sense of the Christian Church in the best and most Primitive Ages, in every one of the Points here mentioned.</p>
               <p>And whether <hi>we are right as to the sense of the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 38, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>and as to Divine Worship in general, as to Christ's Institution amounting to a Command, as to St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Discourse:</hi> Which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier insists upon, next to the Scripture it self, and the Force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein; we appeal to the Primitive Church, as the most indifferent Arbitrator between us.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) I answered; That where words seem plain and positive, they may have a Metaphorical or Figurative Sense; as when God hath <hi>Eyes and Ears,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>given him;</hi> and <hi>the Rock was Christ.</hi> And so in the Words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> it was a Sacramental Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as the other was; and the other words are figurative, when the <hi>Cup</hi> is said to be <hi>the New Testament in his Blood:</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> notwithstanding those words, called it <hi>Bread</hi> after Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Defender</hi> will not bite, the Light being too clear for him; but descants upon denying plain words, and so runs clear <note place="margin">

               <p>But the Replier is a generous Adversary, and attacks what <note place="margin">Rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>I am very glad to see this Point brought to so fair an Issue: For, if I do not prove by the general Consent of the Fathers, both of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Churches,</hi> that by <hi>This</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> is meant, I dare promise to become hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To this it was answered;</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That the Rule of our Religion is unalterable, being the Word of God; tho the Exercise of it be under the Regulation of the Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That altho we attribute the Supreme Jurisdiction to the King, yet we do not question but there are inviolable Rights of the Church which ought to be preserved against the Fancies of some, and the Usurpations of others.</p>

                  <hi>of Scripture established by Law; and therefore if the Law be mutable, the Religion is mutable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Defender <hi>desires I would make it appear, that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

                     <hi>Dis.</hi> p. 78.</note> 
                  <hi>is such a Foundation, as makes the Protestant Church unalterable; for the Letter of Scripture is common to all who bear the Name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. And all Alterations of Religion are made upon pretence of Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To give a clear and distinct Answer, I shall lay down these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That altho Humane Laws be alterable, yet the Divine Law is unchangeable, and continues its Force on the Consciences of Men; so that no Humane Law can make that lawful which God hath sorbidden, nor that unlawful which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Whatever Change therefore may happen as to the Laws of Men, the Law of God is still the same, and its Obli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation cannot be taken off by any Laws of Men. As suppose God hath forbidden the Worship of Images, or of Saints, or of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, upon Supposition that it is not a Creature; no Law in the World can make this lawful; because God's Authority is Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and Antecedent to Man's, and therefore cannot be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seded by an Act of Men. And this is one of the Fund mentals of the Christian Religion, without which it could never have been practised, when the Laws of the Empire were again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> it. So, neither can Humane Laws make that true which is agains<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Word of God, nor that false which is agreeable to it. They can never make <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> a true Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it were nor so before; nor a <hi>Purgatory</hi> necessary to be believed, unless it be proved from Scripture to be so. So that the Foundation of our
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107642:58"/>
Religion, being the Word of God, and the Obligation of that on the Consciences of Men, it must remain the same, tho Humane Laws be mutable. Howbeit, I do not deny the Magistrates Power <hi>in making Laws for regulating the Publick Exercise of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> But as we have cause to thank God for the establishment of the best Church in the Christian World by them among us; so we are unwilling to put <hi>such Cases</hi> as the Defender doth, when <note place="margin">Pag. 80.</note> we enjoy our Religion as established by Law: And it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to be a mistrust of his Majesty's Gracious Promise to protect it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Although the Letter of Scripture be liable to Misinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Abuses, yet the true and genuine Sense of it may be understood; and then there is a great disterence between false and mistaken Notions, and the proper Sense of Scripture. This is very strange Reasoning, if Men will infer that there can be no certainty as to the Sense of Scripture, because so many have mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreted it. Is it any Argument that the Constitution of our Government is not sirm; or that Loyal Subjects cannot be certain of their Duty, because Men of ill Principles have run away with false Notions of a Fundamental Contract, and Coordinate Power? Is there no Certainty in Law, because Judges have been of different Opinions, and determined the same Cause several ways? Is there no Principle of Certainty in the World, because Men have been imposed upon, both by their Senses and Reason? If not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, we must allow that we may judg truly of some Things, (or else we must all turn Scepticks) then we desire no more than to observe the same Rules and Caution in judging the Sense of Scripture, which we do as to our judgment of other Matters. In them we take notice of the Causes of Errors, the Circumstances of Things, the Difference of Objects, the Nature of the <hi>Medium,</hi> and accordingly pass our Judgment. And in Things too small for our view, or too remote, we make use of Glasses to help us; but all this while Men do not reason so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in these Matters. Do they say that some have been deceived by their Glasses and <hi>Telescopes;</hi> therefore there is no certainty in any of them, and they must all be laid aside; and whatever they talk of Spots in the Sun, and the unequal Surface of the Moon, they are all Fancies and <hi>Chimera's</hi> of <hi>giddy Brains,</hi> and no Men of sense can believe them? If Mankind do not argue at this rate in other things, how come they to be so fatally unreasonable
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107642:59"/>
about the Scripture? <hi>The Letter of Scripture,</hi> say they, <hi>is used for this Fancy, and the other Mistake, and a third pleads it for down-right Heresy: I very one thinks he hath the Letter of Scripture for him; and upon that he grounds his Faith.</hi> And what then? The natural Consequence is, that every one would sain have Scripture of his side. Doth it really follow from hence that no Body hath it? Or that there can be no certainty who hath it, and who hath it not? <hi>But every one thinks he hath it.</hi> And what follows? <hi>Some or others must be deceived.</hi> I grant it; <hi>But who shall tell who is deceived, and who not?</hi> I pray let me ask one Question; Are you willing to be deceived, or not? <hi>Who is willing to be deceived?</hi> Every one that will not take the pains to be undeceived, or to prevent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived. <hi>What pains do you mean?</hi> Such honest Industry and Diligence which every one ought to take, who pretends he searches for Truth in order to his Salvation. And I dare affirm, such shall never want Means to attain certainty as to the Sense of Scripture in what concerns their Salvation.</p>
               <p>But suppose the Question be about <hi>Churches,</hi> how can the Church of <hi>England</hi> assure Men that is the true Sense of Scripture which is delivered by it?</p>
               <p>I Answer;</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The Church of <hi>England</hi> hath ofsered all reasonable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to Mankind, that it doth follow the true Sense of Scripture.</p>
               <p>And that by these ways;</p>
               <p n="1">1. By not locking up the Scripture from the view of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but leaving it free and open for all Persons to judg con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Doctrines here taught. Which argues a great assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that our Church is not afraid of any Opposition to be found to the Word of God in the Articles of our Religion. And the contrary is vehemently to be suspected, where Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture is forbidden the People, as it is in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if the Popes Authority signify any thing; for <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> did revoke the Power of granting Licenses, which was allowed by <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> And I do not see how any Confessor can justify his acting against the Pope's Authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By not pretending to deliver the Sense of Scripture on her own Authority. If she did require her Members to depend wholly upon her Sense, without examining themselves, that very thing would render her Authority suspicious with all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107642:59"/>
Men; who always mistrust where there is too much Caution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By her constant appealing to the Primitive Church ever since the Reformation, as the best Voucher for her keeping to the true Sense of Scripture. And in truth, one of the greatest Controversies between our Church and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not about the bare Letter of Scripture, but the best Interpreter of it. Our Church still contending, that the sirst and purest Ages of the Church, next to the Apostles Times, did certainly best understand the Sense aad Meaning of Scripture; and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretending, that the giving the true Sense of Scripture, belongs to the present <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which they would be thought to be, against the plainest Evidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reason. As appears by the foregoing Discourses.</p>
               <p>The Defender's Cavil against the <hi>Prayer</hi> at the end of the Answer, would have held as well against <hi>Amen,</hi> if it had been added to it. But he was to answer all, and therefore the very <hi>Prayer</hi> could not escape his Confutation, or at least his putting an ill construction upon it; which was far from the Intention of him that made it. Who thinks it a part of <hi>a good Christian,</hi> to be <hi>always a Loyal Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the summing up the Evidence in his Conclusion, I shall not follow him in it, since I think the Cause so clear in the opening of it, that I shall leave it as it is, to the Reader's Judgment.</p>

But how this should touch <hi>the King's Supremacy</hi> I cannot imagine.

                  <hi>for the poor Bishop?</hi> The most he will allow him is, <hi>that he was a peaceable old Gentleman, who only desired to possess his Conscience and his Bishoprick in Peace without Offence to any Man, either of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, or that of</hi> England. Yet he hath so much kindness left for the <hi>poor Bishop,</hi> that for his sake he goes about to defend, <hi>that a Man may be a true Member of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>who asserts both Churches to be so far Parts of the Catholick Church, that</hi>

                  <hi>there is no Necessity of going from one Church to another to be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a very surprising Argument from <hi>a new Convert.</hi> Why might he not then have continued still in the Communion of this Church, tho he might look on the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as part of the Catholick Church? The Reason I gave against it was, that every true Member of this Church must own the Doctrine of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Articles and Homilies; which charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with such Errors and unlawful Practices, as no Man who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves them to be such, can continue in the Communion of that Church; and therefore he must believe a Necessity of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of one Communion for the other; and that no true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

               <p>Let us now see what a Talent he hath at <hi>Ergoteering. If this be true,</hi> saith he, <hi>then to be a Member of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>one must assert that either both Churches are not Parts of the Catholick, or that they are so Parts, that there is a necessity of going from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> He would be a strange Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who should hold that both <hi>Churches</hi> are not <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Catholick;</hi> for then he must deny that <hi>Parts</hi> are <hi>Parts;</hi> for ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ry true <hi>Church</hi> is so far a Part of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Therefore, I say, he must hold, tho it be in some respects <hi>a Part</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> yet it may have so many Errors and Corruptions mixed with it, as may make it necessary for Salvation to leave it. <hi>The second,</hi> he saith, <hi>is Nonsense.</hi> How Nonsense? He doth well to hope that Men may be saved that do not understand Controversy; nor <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Heaven in Mood and Figure. A necessity of a Change,</hi> saith he, <hi>consists not with their being Parts; for Parts constitute one Whole, and leave not one and another to go to or from.</hi> We are not speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Parts</hi> leaving <hi>one another;</hi> but of a Person leaving <hi>one Part</hi> to go to another. Suppose a Pestilential Disease rage in one part of the City, and not in another; may it not be necessary to leave one Part and go to the other, tho they are both Parts of the same City, and do not remove from one to the other? But he saith, with great assurance, <hi>that necessity of Change makes it abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impossible for both Churches to be parts of the Catholick.</hi> Which plainly shews, he never understood the Terms of Communion with both Churches. For, no Church in the World can lay on Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon a Man to be dishonest, <hi>i. e.</hi> to profess one thing, and to do another; which is Dissimulation and Hypocrisy. And no Church can oblige a Man to believe what is false, or to do what is unlawful; and rather than do either, he must forsake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of that Church.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given a sufficient taste of the Spirit and Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Gentleman.</p>
               <p>As to the main Design of the <hi>Third Paper,</hi> I declared that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered it, as it was supposed to contain the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> of the <hi>Conversion</hi> of so great a Lady to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <hi>from the Devotions, Mortifications, Austerities, Humility and Charity, which are practised in Catholick Countries, by the Example and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of that lean mortified Apostle</hi> St. Martin Luther.</p>

He knows we pretend not to <hi>Canonize Saints;</hi> and he may know, that a very great Man in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> once said, <hi>That the new Saints they Canonized, would make one question the old Ones.</hi> We neither make a <hi>Saint</hi> nor an <hi>Apostle</hi> of <hi>Martin Luther;</hi> and we know of no Authority he ever had in this Church. Our Church was reformed by it self, and neither by <hi>Luther</hi> nor <hi>Calvin,</hi> whom he had mentioned as well as the other, but for his lean and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Aspect. But after all, <hi>Luther</hi> was as lean and mortified an Apostle as <hi>Bishop Bonner;</hi> but a Man of far greater worth, and sit for the Work he undertook, being of an undaunted Spirit. What a strange sort of Calumny is this, to upbraid our Church, as if it followed the <hi>Example and Precept of</hi> Martin Luther? He knows, how very easy it is for us to retort such things with mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; when for more than an Age together, that Church was governed by such dissolute and profane <hi>Heads</hi> of the Church, that it is a shame to mention them; and all this by the confession of their own Writers. But as to <hi>Luther</hi>'s Person, if his Crimes were his <hi>Corpulency,</hi> what became of all the <hi>fat Abbots</hi> and <hi>Monks? But they were no Apostles, or Reformers.</hi> I easily grant it. But must God chuse Instruments, as some do Horses, by their <hi>fatness to run Races.</hi> As to <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Conversation,</hi> it is justified by those who best knew him, and are Persons of undoubted Reputation, I mean, <hi>Frasmus, Melancthon,</hi> and <hi>Camerarius.</hi> And as to Matters in dispute, if he acted according to his Principles, his Fault lay in his Opinions, and not in acting according to them.</p>
               <p>But whether our Church follow <hi>Luther,</hi> or not, it is Objected, <hi>that we have reformed away the Vertues of good Living.</hi> God forbid. But I dare not think there is any Church in the World, where the Necessity of good Living is more earnestly pressed. But I confess we of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do think the Examples and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Christ and his Apostles, are to be our Rules for the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of good Living. And according to them, I doubt not, but there are as great Examples of <hi>Devotion, Mortification, Humility and Charity,</hi> as in any place whatsoever. But I am afraid this Gentleman's Acquaintance did not lie much that way; nor doth he seem to be a very competent Judg of the Ways of good living, is he did not know how to distinguish between outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and true Christian Vertues. And according to his way of judging, the Disciples of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did very much outdoe those of our <hi>Blessed Saviour;</hi> as appears by a Book we esteem very much, called the <hi>New Testament:</hi> but if I mention it to him, I am

               </p>
               <p>But what <hi>two Articles</hi> were these? It seems <hi>they wished we had kept Confession, which no doubt was commanded of God; and praying for the Dead, which was one of the ancient things of Christianity.</hi> But which of our 39 <hi>Articles</hi> did they renounce hereby? I think I have read and consider'd them, as much as this Gentleman, and I can find no such Articles <hi>against Confession,</hi> and <hi>praying for the Dead.</hi> Our Church, as appears by the Office of the Visitation of the Sick, doth not disallow of <hi>Confession</hi> in particular Cases, but the <hi>necessity</hi> of it in order to Forgiveness in all Cases. And if any Bishop as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted this, then he exceeded the Doctrine of our Church, but he renounced no Article of it. As to the other Point, we have an Article against the <hi>Romish Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Purgatory, Art.</hi> 22. but not a word concerning <hi>praying for the Dead,</hi> without respect to it. But he, out of his great skill in Controversy, believes, <hi>that Prayer for the Dead, and the Romish Doctrine of Purgatory,</hi> are the same. Whereas this relates to the deliverance of Souls out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> by the Suffrages of the Living; which makes all the gainful Trade of <hi>Masses for the Dead,</hi> &amp;c. but the other related to <hi>the Day of Judgment,</hi> as is known to all who are versed in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Ancient Church.

               <p>But I think it may be demonstrated, as far as such things are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, from <hi>Sanders</hi> his own Story, that the King's first Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or <hi>the jogging of his Conscience,</hi> as our Author stiles it, could not come from an inordinate Passion to <hi>Ann Bolleyn.</hi> For he makes Card. <hi>Wolsey</hi> the chief Instrument in the Intrigue. Let us then see what Accounts he gives of his <hi>Motives</hi> to undertake it. He not only takes notice of the great Discontent he took at the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. the Queen's Nephew; but how studious he was upon the first intimation of the King's Scruples, to recommend to him <note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> the <hi>Dutchess</hi> of <hi>Alençon</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Sister; and that <note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> when there were none present but <hi>the King, Wolsey,</hi> and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Wolsey</hi> was sent on a very splendid Ambassy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> and had secret Instructions to carry on the Match with the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Sister. But when he was at <hi>Calais,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Orders from the King to manage other Matters as he was appointed, but not to say a word of that Match. <hi>At which,</hi> saith <note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Sanders, he was in a mighty rage, because he carried on the Divorce for nothing more, than to oblige the most Christian King wholly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by this Marriage.</hi> How could this be, if from the beginning of his Scruples he knew the King designed to marry <hi>Ann Bolleyn?</hi> But <hi>Sanders</hi> thinks to come off with saying, <hi>That</hi> Wolsey <hi>knew of the King's Love, but he thought he designed her only for his Concubine.</hi> But this is plainly to contradict himself; for before he said, <hi>That</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> Wolsey <hi>knew from the beginning whom he intended to marry.</hi> Besides,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107642:65"/>
what Reason could there be, if the King had only a design to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her, that he should put himself and the World to so much trouble to sue out a Divorce? For the Divorce was the main Thing aimed at in all the Negotiations at <hi>Rome;</hi> other Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been more proper, if his Design was only upon having her for a Concubine. <hi>But she would not be corrupted.</hi> If this were the Reason, he must again contradict himself, for he makes her a lewd vicious Woman.

                  <hi>when she returned from</hi> France, <hi>and was at Court, she found out what</hi> Wolsey <hi>designed.</hi> Which makes it evident, by <hi>Sanders</hi> his own words, that the Design of the Divorce was before the thoughts of <hi>Ann Bolleyn.</hi> And it seems very probable, that <hi>Card Wolsey</hi> might carry on a Publick Design by it, to draw the King off from the Emperor, and to unite him with <hi>France.</hi> And the Pope at that time being highly displeased with the Emperor, he might think it no dissicult thing to procure a <hi>Dispensation,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Interest being join'd with our King's.

                  </gap>, I dare not affirm it: It is sussicient for my purpose, that the first Design was laid quite another way. I confess after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when <hi>Wolsey</hi> upon his return from <hi>France,</hi> saw how things were like to go, he struck in with the King's Humour, as appears by the Letters of <hi>Ann Bolleyn</hi> to him: But yet carried himself so coldly afterwards in the Matter of the Divorce, that it proved one occasion of his Fall. <hi>Thuanus,</hi> being an Historian of great Judgment, saw the inconsistencies of <hi>Sanders</hi> his Relations; and therefore concludes that <hi>Wolsey</hi> was surprized with the Business of <hi>Ann Bolleyn,</hi> after he went into <hi>France,</hi> having notice sent him by his Friends; and that <hi>Wolsey</hi> wholly aimed at <hi>the French Match. Mezeray</hi> saith, <hi>The Cardinal could not foresee the Love of</hi> Ann Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn, <hi>but his Design was to be reveaged on the Emperor; and he que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions whether the King were smitten with her, till</hi> Wolsey <hi>was sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> France; when the King so unexpectedly forbad him to proceed in that Match, <hi>cum summo eras dosore,</hi> as <hi>Sanders</hi> confesses. From all this we see plainly, that since <hi>Sanders</hi> makes <hi>Card. Wolsey</hi> the <note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note> great Contriver and Manager of this Business, the immediate Cause of the Schism could not be the Love of <hi>Ann Bolleyn.</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>debated in the Spanish Council, it was then said, That altho the Match between the King and his Brother's Relict were not yet disputed, yet if the King should die without Issue Male, rather than the Kingdom should pass to Foreigners, the English Nation would dispute the Validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Marriage.</hi> And to confirm this, in Sir <hi>Henry Spelman's</hi> Manuscript-Register of the Proceedings of the <hi>Legatine Court</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Divorce, subscribed by the three Notaries there present, the Witnesses deposed, <hi>That at the time of the Marriage, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple said commonly, that it was unfit one Brother should marry the other Brother's Wife.</hi> And Arch-bishop <hi>Warham</hi> then upon Oath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>That he told K.</hi> Henry <hi>the 7th, that the Marriage seem'd to him neither Honourable, nor well-pleasing to God.</hi> And he confesses, <hi>the People then murmur'd at it, but that the murmuring was quieted by the Pope's Dispensation.</hi> So that all the Satisfaction that was given about it, arose from the Pope's extraordinary <hi>dispensing Power with the Laws of God.</hi> Which was a thing vehemently opposed by many in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the University of <hi>Bononia</hi> it self afterwards declared, <hi>That the Match was abominable, and that the Pope himself could not dispense with it;</hi> and this they say was, <hi>after they had read Card.</hi> Cajetan<hi>'s Defence of the Marriage.</hi> The like was done by the University of <hi>Padua;</hi> besid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that <hi>the Succession to the Crown</hi> by this Match, must depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an extravagant Power in the Pope, which the Roman Church it self never owned; and the wisest Statesmen thought by no means sit to depend upon.</p>
               <p>The notice of this Debate in the Spanish Council being sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Card. <hi>Wolsey,</hi> seems to have been the <hi>first Occasion</hi> taken of starting the Question about the Lawfulness of the King's Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; which <hi>Wolsey,</hi> out of a private Grudg to the Emperor, as well as for other Reasons, was not wanting to carry on, till he saw which way it was like to end. And the Pope himself was willing enough to grant the <hi>Bull</hi> for the <hi>Divorce,</hi> till he made a secret Peace with the Emperor: and it is easy to see that the Pope went forwards and backwards in the whole Affair, merely as <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Considerations</hi> moved him. Which being fully known to so discerning a Prince as <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> it gave him just occasion to question, whether that Authority were so Divine as was pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which in so great a Matter did not govern it self by any Rule of Conscience, but by Political Measures.</p>
               <p>One remarkable Circumstance in this Matter ought not to be omitted, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King's Agent at <hi>Rome</hi> sent him word, <hi>That the Pope's Advice was, that if the King's Conscience were satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>

                  <hi>he should presently marry another Wife, and then prosecute the Suit; and that this was the only way for the King to attain his Desires.</hi> But the King refused to do it. And when Card <hi>Wolsey</hi> sent a Message to the King to the same purpose: the King replied, <hi>If the Bull be naught, let it be so declared; and if it be good, it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be broken by any by-ways for me.</hi> And when he objected the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousness of the Suit, he answered, <hi>Since he had Patience eighteen</hi>

                  <hi>Years, he would stay yet four or five more, since the Opinion of all the Clerks of his Kingdom (besides two) were lately declared for him:</hi> Adding, <hi>That he had studied the Matter himself, and Writers of it; and that he found it was unlawful, DE JURE DIVINO, and undispensible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have found the King himself declaring in Publick and Private, his real dissatisfaction in Point of <hi>Conscience;</hi> and that it was no inordinate Affection to <hi>Ann Bolleyn</hi> which put him upon it: and the same attested by Sir <hi>Tho. More,</hi> and the Circumstances of Affairs. I now proceed to another Witness.</p>
               <p>The next is Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> himself, in his Preface to <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s Book of <hi>True Obedience:</hi> For thus he begins; <hi>Forasmuch as there be some, doubtless, now at this present, which think the Controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107642:66"/>
the King's Royal Majesty, and the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>consisteth in this Point, for that his Majesty hath taken the most excellent and most noble Lady</hi> Ann <hi>to his Wife; whereas in very deed, notwithstanding, the Matter is far otherwise, and nothing so.</hi> So that if Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> may be believed, <hi>there was no such immediate Cause of the Schism, as the Love to</hi> Ann Bolleyn. And withal he adds, <hi>That this Book was published, that the World might understand what was the whole Voice and resolute Determination of the best and greatest learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, with all the Nobles and Commons of</hi> England; <hi>not only in the Cause of Matrimony, but also in defending the Gospel's Doctrine,</hi> i. e. <hi>against the Pope's usurped Authority over the Church.</hi> Again, he saith, <hi>That the King's Marriage was made, by the ripe Judgment, Authority, and Privilege of the most and principal Universities of the World; and then with the Consent of the whole Church of</hi> England. <hi>And that the false pretended Supremacy of the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>was most justly abrogated; and that if there were no other Cause but this Marriage, the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>would content himself,</hi> i. e. <hi>if he might enjoy his Power and Revenues still; which,</hi> he saith, <hi>were so insupportable, that there lay the true Cause of the Breach: For his Revenues here were near as great as the King's; and his Tyranny was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> in his Book, not only affirms <hi>the King's former Marriage to be unlawful, and the second to be just and lawful;</hi> but <hi>that he had the Consent of the Nation, and the Judgment of his Church, as well as foreign Learned Men for it.</hi> And afterwards he strenuously argues against <hi>the Pope's Authority here, as a meer Usurpation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the whole Clergy not only then owned the King's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, <hi>(Fisher</hi> excepted) but in the Book published by Authority, called, <hi>A Necessary Doctrine and Erudition of a Christian Man,</hi> &amp;c. The Pope's Authority was rejected as an Usurpation, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Scripture and Antiquity. K. <hi>James</hi> I. declares, <hi>That there was a General and Catholick Conclusion of the whole Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>in this Case.</hi> And when some Persons suspected, that it all came from the King's Marriage, Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> we see undertakes <note place="margin">Apol. for the Oath of All<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Separation was made then by a General Consent of the Nation, the King, and Church, and People, all concurring: and the Reasons inducing them to cast off the Popes Usurpation, were published to the World at that time. And those Reasons have no relation at all to the King's Marriage; and if they are good, as they thought they were, and this Gentleman saith not a word to disprove them, then the Foundation of the Disunion between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Us, was not laid <hi>in the King's inordinate Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> but on just and sufficient Reasons.</p>

               <p>What the <hi>Supremacy</hi> was, is best understood by the Book pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the King's Order, and drawn up by the Bishops of that Time.

For it is out of doubt,</hi> saith that Book, <hi>that Christ's Faith was then most pure and firm, and the Scriptures of God were then best understood, and Vertue did then most abound and excel: And therefore it must needs follow, that the Customs and Ordinances then used and made, be more conform and agreeable unto the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ, and more conducing unto the edifying and benefit of the Church of Christ, than any Custom or Laws used or made by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of</hi> Rome, <hi>or any other addicted to that See and usurped Power since that time.</hi>

This Book was published with the King's Declaration before it. And therefore we have reason to look on the <hi>Supremacy</hi> to be taken as it is there explained. And what is there now <hi>so wholly Spiritual, that no Layman, or King of</hi> Israel, <hi>ever exercised in this Supremacy?</hi> But this Writer never took the pains to search into these things, and therefore talks so at random about them.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Persecutions</hi> that followed, it is well known that both sides blame K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. for his Severity; and therefore this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be laid to the Charge of his Separation. For the other Effect of <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> I do not see how this follows from the Reformation: For although some Uses might cease by the Doctrines of it, as Monks to pray the Dead out of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> yet there were others to have employed the Church Lands about, as some of them were in founding <hi>New Bishopricks,</hi> &amp;c. And I have nothing to say in justification of any Abuses committed that way; only that the King and Parliament could not discern the difference between greater and lesser as to the Point of <hi>Sacrilege;</hi> and since the Pope had shewed them the way, by granting <hi>Bulls for the dissolution of the lesser Monasteries,</hi> they thought, since the Pope's Power was taken away, they might, with as little <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> dissolve the rest. I will shut up this with the words of Arch-bishop <hi>Laud; But if there have been any wilful and gross Errors, not so much in Opinion as</hi>

                  <hi>Fact, (Sacrilege too often pretending to reform Superstition) that's the Crime of the Reformers, not of the Reformation, and they are long since gone to God to answer it, to whom I leave them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Method I proposed for Satisfaction of Conscience about the Reformation, was to consider, Whether there were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause for it? Whether there were not sufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? And whether the Proceedings of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were not justifiable by the Rules of Scripture, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church? He tells me, <hi>he may safely join issue with me upon all three Points, and conclude in the Negative.</hi> But upon second thoughts, he finds he may much more safely let it alone: And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Pag. 1. 2.</note> fairly would have me take it for granted, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>cannot err in Matters of Faith;</hi> (for that he must mean by the Church there) <hi>and that our Church hath no Authority ef Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming her self;</hi> and <hi>that our Proceedings were not justifiable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the right interpretation of Scriptures by the Fathers and Councils.</hi> But if I will not allow his <hi>Affirmations</hi> for <hi>Proofs,</hi> for his part he will act the <hi>grim Logician</hi> no longer; and in truth, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him so ill, that he doth well to give it over. When he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107642:68"/>
will undertake to prove, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>One Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Infallible Church of Christ,</hi> and answer what I have produced in the former Discourses, I will ease him of any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trouble; for then I will grant that our Reformation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be justified. But till then, I shall think it no want of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to conclude the Victory to be on our side. And I would desire him not to end with such a bare-faced Assertion of a thing so well known to be false, <hi>viz. That there is not one Original Treatise written by a Protestant, which hath handled distinctly, and by it seif, that Christian Vertue of Humility.</hi> Since within a few Years (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what hath been printed formerly) such a Book hath been published in <hi>London.</hi> But he doth well to bring it off with, <hi>at least that I have seen or heard of;</hi> for such Books have not lain much in the way of his Enquiries. Suppose we had not such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Books, we think the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> gives the best Rules and Examples of <hi>Humility</hi> of any Book in the World; but I am afraid he should look on his Case as desperate if I send him to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> since he saith, <hi>Our Divines do that, as Physicians do with their Patients whom they think uncurable, send them at last to</hi> Tunbridg-Waters, <hi>or to the Air of</hi> Montpellier.</p>
