            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHAT advantage the Enemy of God and
Man hath got againſt Truth, Holineſs,
and Love, by the Diviſions of Chriſtians,
and eſpecially by the Contentions of their
Teachers, Experience hath been long telling the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
World, by ſmart and ſorrow: Where Envy and Strife
hath begun, Confuſion and every Evil Work hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed:
Little Breaches tend to greater: The Cauſe
which firſt made them, will make them wider, by calling
in more Cauſes to its help and ſervice. Diſtinct <hi>Parties</hi>
have their diſtinct <hi>Intereſts,</hi> as to <hi>Commodity</hi> and <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
And, alas! what work will <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>fleſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi>
make? What <hi>Moralities,</hi> what <hi>Untruths, Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi>
and <hi>Unmercifulneſs</hi> is it pregnant with? What Evil
ſo great, that it will not firſt venture on, and then palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
and next juſtifie, and laſtly propagate, if God do not
mortifie, or reſtrain it? The foreſight of this Danger to
the Land of our Nativity, moved ſome of Us to ſtrive
for the prevention of it, while we thought there was
place for our Endeavours: But as our labour did but

Diſcord, in the ſpace of more than two Apprentiſhips,
hath wrought no (perceived) Cure on Mens Minds, nor
deliverance to the Church. The Diſcord, which began
about <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> is by ſome now pretended
to be alſo in <hi>Doctrinals,</hi> and about the Principles of Civil
Government, and Humane Society and Peace. And
whither increaſing Diſcord, by the power of <hi>Intereſt</hi> and
<hi>Envy,</hi> may yet carry the Charge, or how much wider
yet Dividers may perſwade the Ignorant that the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is, we cannot foretel: But becauſe we are ſure that
all tendeth to the ruine of <hi>Brotherly Love,</hi> and that he
that <hi>hateth his Brother is a Murderer, and hath not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

we can from ſuch a <hi>damning ſin,</hi> we take it to be our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to detect the Errours of Contentious Dividers, and to
hinder their farther widening of the Breach. Which we
ſhall here attempt about this Queſtion, much agitated of
late.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether the Parties called Conformiſts and Non-Conformiſts
do really differ, about the nature and ſufficiency
of Morality compared with the Grace of Chriſt? <hi>Neg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Explication of our Terms, 1. What we
mean by <hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> we have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhewed on another Queſtion: we mean not that if a
Papiſt, or Socinian, or Quaker ſhould join either with
the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> or <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> they would not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
differ from others: but that they that are now called
<hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> herein differ not: 1. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
<hi>qua tales;</hi> 2. No nor Materially, <hi>qui tales,</hi> being
<hi>meerly</hi> ſuch.</p>
                  <p>2. We ſpeak only of the <hi>Parties:</hi> For as to ſome indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63040:3"/>
perſons, it cannot be expected that any Parties in
the World ſhould be wholly made up of men ſo wiſe, as
that none among them have Ignorance enough to wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
in the dark.</p>
                  <p>3. The Terms <hi>[Grace]</hi> and <hi>[Morality]</hi> muſt be anon
explained in our Proof.</p>
                  <p>Which Proof (as in our laſt Caſe) we fetch, I. From
our common conſent to the ſacred Scriptures, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Creeds, and the doctrinal Articles and Homilies of
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which ſurely contain all that is
needful to be held about the difference of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</hi>
Nor hath either Party declared their diſſent by
any contradiction of any of the aforeſaid Articles or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
                  <p>II. Our ſecond Proof is, by a <hi>ſufficient explication,</hi>
and <hi>enumeration</hi> of the Points in which we are agreed.</p>
                  <p>I. The word GRACE is taken, 1. EFFICIENTLY,
2. OBJECTIVELY, 3. SUBJECTIVELY.</p>
                  <p>I. EFFICIENTLY, <hi>Grace</hi> is taken, 1. For the Efficient
<hi>Principle:</hi> 2. For the Efficient <hi>Action</hi> of the firſt Cauſe:
3. For the Efficient <hi>Means</hi> and its operation.</p>
                  <p>1. Grace taken for the Efficient <hi>Principle,</hi> ſignifieth
<hi>God's</hi> efficient <hi>Favour, Love, Mercy,</hi> or <hi>Will</hi> to do good
freely to the Unworthy.</p>
                  <p>2. Grace taken for <hi>God's</hi> Efficient <hi>Action,</hi> ſignifieth
the ſame <hi>Good-will</hi> of God <hi>ex parte ſui,</hi> but as <hi>connoting</hi>
the <hi>Effect in fieri vel facto eſſe.</hi> The former is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as <hi>Decreeing</hi> or meerly <hi>Willing;</hi> but this as <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Grace taken for the <hi>Efficient Means,</hi> is an <hi>effect</hi>
of <hi>God's free Love,</hi> and a <hi>ſecond Cauſe</hi> of Man's ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and hath many parts; of which CHRIST as
Mediator is the Head or Chief, and his Goſpel, Miniſters,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63040:4"/>
Sacraments, and Providences are inferior ſubſervient
parts: All which are the Efficient Grace of God.</p>
                  <p>II. OBJECTIVELY, Grace is all God's free-given Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
as it is offered and propoſed to Man's actual <hi>Belief, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,</hi>
and <hi>Improvement,</hi> (or uſe.)</p>
                  <p>Even as the word <hi>Fides</hi> ſignifieth, 1. The <hi>fidelity</hi> or
<hi>truſtineſs</hi> of God the <hi>Promiſer</hi> or <hi>Revealer:</hi> 2. The <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
or <hi>truſtineſs</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> promiſing or aſſerting:
3. The Belief or Truſt of the Believer; <hi>(Fidem promit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentis,
fidem promiſſi, &amp; fidem credentis.)</hi> So the word
GRACE hath the like three ſignifications: 1. The
Grace of the <hi>Giver.</hi> 2. The Grace of the extrinſick <hi>Gift.</hi>
3. The intrinſick Grace of the <hi>Receiver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Objective <hi>Grace,</hi> or <hi>Free-Gift,</hi> is, 1. <hi>God himſelf,</hi>
as offered us Relatively through Chriſt to be our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
God and Father, with his Love, and our Relation
to him as his Children. 2. Chriſt himſelf, to be our
Head and Saviour, and our Relation to him, as his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
ſaved Members. 3. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to be our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier,
our Relation to him and his Grace as offered:
This is the Grace offered and given us in Baptiſm by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
on Gods part. Under theſe are the <hi>Objective
Means</hi> (the Goſpel as it is to be believed, the ſanctified
Mercies of this preſent life, the Ordinances as to be
uſed, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and ultimately, Heaven as the end of all: Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
freely given being the perfection of ſubjective Grace,
and as propoſed and offered being the perfection of obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Grace.</p>
                  <p>III. SUBJECTIVELY, GRACE, is, 1. <hi>Gracious</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
and Habits; 2. <hi>Gracious Acts; viz.</hi> 1. Of the
<hi>Intellect,</hi> 2. The <hi>Will,</hi> 3. The <hi>Executive</hi> power in practiſe.
The word GRACE hath in the uſe of Divines all theſe
ſignifications, beſides ſeveral ſub-diviſions which the
Schoolmen ordinarily make.</p>

                  <p>II. The words [MORALITY] and [MORAL]
have alſo divers ſignifications.</p>
                  <p>I. In the firſt moſt comprehenſive and moſt famous
ſenſe, MORALITY, as diſtinguiſhed from meer <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turality</hi>
or Phyſicks, doth ſignifie the Relation of the
<hi>Manners</hi> or <hi>Acts</hi> of an Intelligent free Agent to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Will and Law of God: And ſo <hi>Actus morales</hi>
and <hi>Actus humani</hi> are uſed in the ſame ſenſe; and all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
is diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Moral Good</hi> and <hi>Moral Evil,
Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. Some have uſed MORALITY in a narrower
ſenſe, unfitly, for ſo much of Man's duty as is <hi>revealed</hi>
by the <hi>meer Law of Nature,</hi> and as is of common obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to lapſed Mankind: And ſo it comprehendeth the
<hi>relicts</hi> of the Law of <hi>Innocent Nature</hi> (to <hi>love God and
obey him, &amp;c.)</hi> and the <hi>additional Law</hi> of <hi>Lapſed Nature,</hi>
(to <hi>Repent,</hi> and uſe all poſſible means for our <hi>recovery,</hi> and
thankfully improve the Mercies which we receive.) And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63040:5"/>
thus it is diſtinguiſhed from Duty <hi>known</hi> by <hi>ſupernatural
Revelation,</hi> and eſpecially the Myſteries of Redemption
by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>III. Some uſe the word (improperly alſo) for <hi>all that
Duty</hi> which is of <hi>perpetual Obligation,</hi> whether by <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
or <hi>ſupernatural Revelation:</hi> And ſo it is diſtinguiſhed
from <hi>Temporary Duties:</hi> And thus the <hi>Lords-Day, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi>
the <hi>Lords-Supper,</hi> a <hi>Goſpel Miniſtry,</hi> Scripture (to
be uſed) <hi>diſcipline,</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>Moral-Poſitives,</hi> diſtinct
from meer <hi>Natural Duties,</hi> and from <hi>Temporaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. Laſtly, Some, yet more unaptly, confine the ſenſe
to the Duties of our common Converſation <hi>towards man,</hi>
as diſtinct from <hi>Holineſs</hi> or our Duty to God: And ſo
they diſtinguiſh a meer <hi>moral honeſt</hi> man, from a <hi>godly</hi>
or <hi>religious</hi> man.</p>
                  <p>Though we wiſh that the needleſs uſe of words impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
were not the common Fuel of vain Contendings,
yet we being not the Maſters of Language, muſt take
words as we find them uſed, and leave all men arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to uſe them as they pleaſe, ſo be it they will but tell us
what they mean by them, before they lay any ſtreſs on
them in diſputing.</p>
                  <p>In reference to theſe various ſenſes of theſe words, we
ſuppoſe that we are all agreed as followeth.</p>
                  <p>I As to MORALITY in the firſt and moſt famous
ſignification, we are agreed, 1. That all proper <hi>Humane
Acts</hi> are <hi>moral,</hi> that is, <hi>morally Good</hi> or <hi>Evil:</hi> And all
<hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Sin, Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> in <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Act, Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
and <hi>Privative</hi> Vice, are parts of <hi>Morality; moral
Good</hi> directly, and <hi>moral Evil</hi> reductively and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> or the <hi>Love of God as God,</hi> is
the chief part of Morality; and what Duty ſoever is
<hi>Evangelical</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> is alſo <hi>moral.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:63040:5"/>
3. Nothing is morally laudable or rewardable, but
Moral Good; and nothing is puniſhable, but Moral Evil.</p>
                  <p>4. All <hi>Morality</hi> is ſeated primarily in the <hi>Will,</hi> but is
ſecondarily (as flowing thence) in the imperate Acts of
the Intellect, and inferior Faculties.</p>
                  <p>5. All <hi>truly moral Good in lapſed man,</hi> is, 1. From
God's <hi>Efficient Grace. 2.</hi> And exerciſed on ſome <hi>Objective
Grace.</hi> And, 3. Is it ſelf <hi>Subjective Grace,</hi> either <hi>ſpecial</hi>
or <hi>common.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. The <hi>Good</hi> called <hi>Moral</hi> in Infidels, and all other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
unſanctified men, is ſuch but <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> and
not <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> nor in the full or propereſt ſenſe: Becauſe
<hi>bonum eſt ex omnibus Cauſis eſſentialibus:</hi> And a good
<hi>Principle, Rule, End, and right Object,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Object,</hi> are all eſſential to a truly good moral Act:
But every ungodly man in every Action doth want at
leaſt ſome one of theſe. And an Act is denominated in
Morality from that which is prevalent in it, and not from
every conquered depreſt ingredient: We ſay not that he
that killeth his Father or Prince, with the reluctancy of
better thoughts and inclinations, doth therein do a <hi>good
work,</hi> though that <hi>reluctancy</hi> was good: So he that hath
<hi>ſome Love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> but <hi>more Hatred;</hi> and <hi>more
love</hi> to <hi>ſinful pleaſure;</hi> doth not a work properly <hi>Good,</hi>
which proceedeth from ſuch a mixed Cauſe. But the
evil Principle and End is predominant in all ungodly
men.</p>
                  <p>7. But materially, and <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> bad men may
do Works that are <hi>morally good,</hi> and phyſically <hi>very good</hi>
to <hi>others;</hi> as Governing and Protecting Common-wealths
and Churches, building Cities and Temples, and Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
relieving the Poor, preaching the Goſpel, expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Scripture, defending Truth, promoting Learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:63040:6"/>
and in good Nature, Patience, Meekneſs, Temperance,
Chaſtity, Wit, and Induſtry, they may be commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and exemplary, and their Precepts and Practice may
conduce much to the good of others.</p>
                  <p>8. Whatever good is found in Heathens or Infidels, or
ungodly Men, is to be acknowledged and praiſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
according to its real worth; it being all from
God, who muſt not be robbed of his praiſe.</p>
                  <p>9. A Man that hath but <hi>Common Grace</hi> is better than
he would be if he had none, and it is the uſual prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
for ſpecial ſaving Grace. Though many civil tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
perſons, by overvaluing <hi>Common Good,</hi> are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from ſeeking Special Grace, that is not <hi>cauſed</hi> by the
<hi>Good,</hi> but by their abuſe of it objectively. And though
God take <hi>occaſion</hi> from ſome mens great ſins, to affright
their Conſciences to Repentance and Reformation, that
is not <hi>cauſed</hi> by the ſin, but by Gods Mercy: <hi>Sin</hi> as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred</hi>
is <hi>not ſin</hi> in the act of <hi>remembring,</hi> nor ſin as
<hi>repented</hi> of in <hi>repenting;</hi> but <hi>before</hi> in the <hi>committing.</hi>
God may Convert <hi>Paul</hi> in the act of Perſecuting: But
Perſecuting is not the way or means of Converſion.
Special Grace muſt be ſought in the uſe of Common
Grace, and not in a way of negligence, contempt, or
wilful ſin.</p>
                  <p>II. Of MORALITY in the ſecond ſenſe (as taken
for <hi>Natural Duties,</hi> which all Mankind is obliged to by
Natural Revelation of God's Will) we are agreed, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>1. The ſum of this <hi>Natural</hi> Morality or Duty, is to
love God as God for himſelf, and all things elſe for him,
even as being <hi>of Him,</hi> and <hi>through Him,</hi> and <hi>to Him;</hi>
to obey God, and make it our chief care to pleaſe him,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63040:6"/>
and therein to place and ſeek our Happineſs, even in
everlaſting mutual love: To love others as our ſelves, and
do all the good we can to all for Soul and Body, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the moſt publick Societies; to do juſtly, and as we
would be done by; to uſe our Bodies as the Servants of
our Souls, and Soul and Body as the Servants of God:
And to hate and avoid all that is <hi>contrary</hi> to theſe. This
Natural Evidence will prove to be the Common Duty of
Mankind.</p>
                  <p>2. This Love to God and Man before deſcribed is true
<hi>Holineſs;</hi> that is, The Soul's ſeparation and devotedneſs
to God.</p>
                  <p>3. All the <hi>Evidence</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi> affordeth us herein,
is not ſeen by all men that are of natural Wit or Induſtry,
no more than all that is revealed by the Scripture is
known to all that read the Scripture, or that believe it.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Holineſs</hi> is the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Medicinal Grace,</hi> as uſed by
<hi>Chriſt on us,</hi> and as uſed <hi>by us towards Chriſt</hi> as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator:
Faith in Chriſt is to kindle in us the holy love of
God, and obedience to him: Love therefore as the final
and everlaſting Grace, is preferred by the Apoſtle, <hi>1 Cor.
12.</hi> laſt <hi>v.</hi> and 13. throughout.</p>
                  <p>5. Even our Faith in Chriſt, and our Obedience to the
Goſpel (in Preaching, Sacraments, and ſuch like) are
neither only of <hi>natural,</hi> nor only of <hi>ſupernatural Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
but <hi>mixt: Chriſt</hi> and his Ordinances are <hi>ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
revealed;</hi> but being once <hi>revealed,</hi> with the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Divine Authority, <hi>natural Revelation</hi> then tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us that it is our Duty to believe and obey.</p>
                  <p>6. That which is of <hi>Natural Revelation and Obligation,</hi>
muſt be performed by <hi>ſupernatural Grace.</hi> Though Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
prove that all Men ſhould love God as God, it is Grace
that muſt diſpoſe and enable them to do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:63040:7"/>
7. We call Grace <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> not only becauſe it is
not eſſential to Nature (no not to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency)
but becauſe in our lapſed ſtate it is not conveyed to us by
<hi>Natural Generation,</hi> but Nature in the ſtate of pravity is
deprived of it; and becauſe God worketh it by the free
gift of his Spirit, in a manner beyond the ſearch of man,
and by it, as an effect of his love, doth make us lovely,
(in our union and relation to Chriſt who ſanctifieth and
juſtifieth us) it being his Image on the Soul, which no
meer Natural Cauſes, without this operation of God's
Love and Spirit, can effect.</p>
                  <p>But yet, 1. We all agree that Holineſs is <hi>Nature's
health</hi> or rectitude, and therefore ſutable to it as its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
as health is to the Body. 2. And that the Spirit of
God doth ordinarily make uſe of his <hi>appointed means,</hi> and
eſpecially his Word, for our ſanctification. And theſe
being <hi>ſecond Cauſes,</hi> which have their <hi>proper Natures,</hi>
may ſo far be called <hi>natural Cauſes:</hi> And that <hi>thus far
Grace</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>Natural.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. This <hi>Holy Love</hi> being the <hi>final Act,</hi> on God the
<hi>final Object,</hi> and ſo being man's <hi>felicity it ſelf,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that all men have <hi>ſo much happineſs conſtitutively,</hi>
as they have <hi>holy love to God and Goodneſs;</hi> and that no
man can be <hi>damned</hi> that hath the ſaid <hi>predominant holy
Love,</hi> while ſuch: And that ſuch have no cauſe to fear
damnation, any farther than they ſhould fear leſt by
forfeiting Gods Grace they ſhould loſe that love.</p>
                  <p>9. The <hi>Mediation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and our <hi>Faith</hi> in him,
who is the Glaſs, the Meſſenger, and the great Gift of
the Fathers Love, are the <hi>Means</hi> appointed by God to
ſanctifie us, by the effecting of this Love, with all its
Concomitants and Fruits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63040:7"/>
10. Therefore as God is called <hi>[All in All]</hi> ſo Chriſt is
called <hi>[All in all,] Col. 3. 11.</hi> to Believers, as being the
Way, the Truth, and the Life.</p>
                  <p>11. Therefore they that would bring men to the <hi>holy</hi>
and <hi>felicitating Love of God,</hi> muſt preach Jeſus Chriſt
and his Grace to them, as the means, and bring them to
believe in him, and to take it for their Wiſdom to know
Chriſt crucified, and glorified, and to learn of him, and
obey him, and truſt in him, and daily to uſe him as their
Mediator for acceſs to God, acceptance with him, and
communication from him.</p>
                  <p>12. To preach up the bleſſedneſs of Saints and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of holineſs, without teaching men how to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it <hi>by Chriſt,</hi> is but to commend health to the ſick,
without directing them to the <hi>Phyſician</hi> and the <hi>Remedies:</hi>
And to hear of a <hi>Sanctity and Felicity</hi> not <hi>attainable,</hi> is to
be tormented by deſpair: And to think to obtain it by
our <hi>works</hi> or endeavours, without a <hi>Mediator</hi> and
his <hi>Grace</hi> (or by any other Mediator than Chriſt,) is
the way to loſe it by falſe preſumption, and neglect
of the neceſſary means: It being <hi>Chriſt that is made
of God to us, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. As Chriſt on Earth did purchaſe us this Salvation
by his <hi>meritorious Righteouſneſs and Sacrifice;</hi> and is now
in Heaven our Head and Interceſſor, and the Treaſury of
Grace and Life to Believers, ſo he ſanctifieth us by his
WORD and SPIRIT; and herein differeth from all
other Teachers that ever were in the World, 1. That
his Goſpel (Doctrine, Precepts, and Covenant-promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes)
are ſingularly ſuited to this ſanctifying work.
2. That he ſendeth forth his Spirit with it, to work
the Souls of men to that which he teacheth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63040:8"/>
and commandeth, that ſo they may be effectually <hi>taught
of God:</hi> Without the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> no <hi>word</hi> or <hi>means</hi>
will ſanctifie and renew a Soul.</p>
                  <p>14. Therefore all Preachers muſt jointly preach GOD
and holy LOVE, (truſt, obedience, and delight in him)
as the END, and CHRIST and <hi>faith in him,</hi> and
<hi>learning of him,</hi> and <hi>obeying him</hi> in the uſe of his heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Remedies, as the MEANS: This being <hi>life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
to know the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he
hath ſent,</hi> Joh. 17. 3.</p>
                  <p>15. And though the <hi>End</hi> muſt be preached as more
excellent than the <hi>Means,</hi> yet the <hi>Means</hi> muſt be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as more <hi>myſterious,</hi> and above meer natural Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Experience telleth us, that all men quickly learn to
confeſs that they ſhould <hi>repent of ſin,</hi> and <hi>love God as
God;</hi> but they are hardly taught to underſtand the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Redemption, the Perſon, Incarnation, Works, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and Grace of the Redeemer; and therefore have
here need of longer teaching: The <hi>Grace</hi> of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, the <hi>Love</hi> of God the Father, and the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
of the Holy Spirit, muſt be the Preachers ſubject, as
it is the Chriſtians benediction and felicity.</p>
                  <p>16. There are things in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Ethicks, and in the
Ethicks of the Stoicks and and ſome other Philoſophers,
of great worth and uſe to Chriſtians, to ſhew us what by
natural evidence may be diſcerned: But they are all poor,
defective, ſpirit-leſs Doctrines and Precepts, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of the Goſpel of Chriſt, though to carnal wit
they ſeem to excel it in Method, Language, and ſeveral
Curioſities: And the Writings of Chriſtians, who do but
expound and apply Chriſt's Doctrine, do far excel all
the Heathens Ethicks.</p>
                  <p>17. We have no reaſon to think that any of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63040:8"/>
underſtood <hi>all</hi> that <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf by way of <hi>proving-Evidence</hi>
revealeth: Yea, or that any <hi>Chriſtians perfectly</hi>
underſtand it; becauſe natural evidences are exceeding
numerous, and none can ſay that he ſeeth them all; and
they are of various degrees, ſome plain, and ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure;
and even <hi>natural verities,</hi> as they ariſe from the
great Branches, into innumerable Partitions as ſmaller
Sprigs, are not perfectly diſcernable by a mortals Eye.</p>
                  <p>18. Therefore no knowledge of Man, much leſs any
Heathens Writings, are the certain meaſure of natural
verities, in Morality, by which the number and certainty
of the obſcurer Particles may be known.</p>
                  <p>19. Though Heathens know and teach, that we muſt
<hi>Love God and Goodneſs</hi> above all: And all that ſincerely
love God and Goodneſs ſhall certainly be ſaved: Yet this
Confeſſion will but more condemn them, that <hi>have not,
and practice not</hi> what they teach; but, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
to know God, by their works deny him, and are
void of true ſanctifying Grace.</p>
                  <p>20. Therefore it is intolerable in thoſe that are ſtiled
the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Preachers of the Goſpel,</hi> to
preach little more than what Heathens teach; and when
they ſpeak of <hi>Chriſtianity and Faith,</hi> and ſhould open
the <hi>Myſteries of the Goſpel,</hi> to do it as drily, ſcantly, and
heartleſly, as if it were done but on the bye, and for Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
or Faſhion ſake, rather than as a matter of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
and importance before deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>In all this we are agreed.</p>
                  <p>III. As to MORALITY in the third ſenſe (as it
ſignifieth <hi>Naturals</hi> and <hi>Poſitives</hi> of perpetual Obligation)
we are agreed, 1. That all to whom they are promulgate
are obliged to the practice of them. 2. And that for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63040:9"/>
                     <hi>that Practice</hi> we need the <hi>fore-deſcribed</hi> helps of Grace;
even <hi>efficient, objective, and ſubjective Grace:</hi> For ſaving
Practice ſpecial Grace, and for common Practice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Grace.</p>
                  <p>IV. And as to the fourth Senſe of MORALITY
(as ſignifying only our Duty to <hi>Man,</hi> as diſtinct from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
to God) we are agreed,</p>
                  <p>1. That as the Love of our Neighbour as our ſelves
is the ſecond great Commandment like to the firſt, ſo
the practice of this in our Duty towards Man, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Love and Obedience to God,</hi> is the ſecond part of
our Duty, and to be preached and practiſed accordingly.</p>
                  <p>2. And it is that part, about a near diſcernable Object,
by which our Love to God muſt be <hi>expreſſed</hi> and made
<hi>known;</hi> and by which it ſhall, by Chriſt himſelf, be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of at the laſt day.</p>
                  <p>3. And it is that <hi>Matter</hi> in which God will have our
obedience to him to be carefully and conſtantly exerciſed:
Becauſe God needeth us not himſelf, but as his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Man is his ordering us to our own good and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
ſo he obligeth us to do good to our ſelves, and one
another.</p>
                  <p>4. But as Man without God is <hi>nothing, and no Man;</hi>
ſo <hi>Duty and Love to Man,</hi> not depending on <hi>Duty and Love
to God,</hi> is no <hi>Duty,</hi> no <hi>Morality</hi> at all: And as to love,
honour, or <hi>obey Man</hi> above God, as the beſt or <hi>greateſt,</hi>
is damnable Idolatry, or Rebellion againſt God; ſo to
preach up Love, Honour, and Obedience to Man, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from, or not dependent on our Love, Honour, and
Obedience to God (much more as <hi>above him,</hi> or <hi>againſt
him)</hi> were but to preach up Idolatry, or Rebellion. No
Man can love Man for Gods ſake, that loveth not God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63040:9"/>
more; And no Man can <hi>honour or obey</hi> Man for Gods
ſake, who doth not more <hi>honour and obey</hi> God. He that
will ſerve Man more than God, doth as it were make
Man his God, and from Man muſt expect his Protection,
Proviſion, and Reward.</p>
                  <p>5. Profeſſion of Piety to God without true Juſtice and
Charity to man, is but Hypocriſie. While we have
time we muſt do good (as we are able) to all Men,
for with ſuch Sacrifice God is well pleaſed, <hi>Gal. 6. Heb.
13.</hi> Chriſt was our great Pattern in doing good, even
to the unworthy, and he purifieth to himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
People zealous of good works, <hi>Tit. 2. 14.</hi> For we
are his workmanſhip, created unto good works in Chriſt
Jeſus, which God hath ordained that we ſhould walk in
them, <hi>Eph. 2. 10.</hi> To be rich in good works is to be
rich to God, <hi>Luke 12. 21.</hi> and to lay up a good Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the time to come, to lay hold on eternal Life, to
lay up our Treaſure in Heaven, and to make us Friends
of (that which to worldlings is) the unrighteous Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
and bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain
mercy; and receiving a Prophet in the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
or a righteous Man in the name of a righteous
Man, is the way to have a Prophets, or a righteous
mans reward, when Chriſt will ſay, In as much as ye
did it to one of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye did it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me. Pure Religion and undefiled, is to viſit the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and Widdows in their Adverſity, and to keep our
ſelves unſpotted of the World.</p>
                  <p>As we verily believe that not only the Parties called
<hi>Conformiſts,</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> (alas! that we muſt
call them Parties) but moſt true Proteſtants are agreed
in all this, ſo we take it to be our Duty to profeſs our
diſſent from the Practice of ſuch as would hinder Love

                  <p>We take the Queſtion as we hear it ſtated by ſome
Accuſers of the Non-conformiſts, who feign them to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it: And ſome ſeem ſerious in the Fiction, as if they
did indeed believe themſelves; by which they diſpatch
theſe ſeveral works of no ſmall moment; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. They hereby render the Non-Conformiſts contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
and odious, as Brain-ſick Perſons, who keep up a
dividing Faction in ſpight of the Light and Obligation
of the Common Principles of Humanity and Society.</p>
                  <p>2. They hereby imprint the Stamp of Satan, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:63040:12"/>
the <hi>hatred of their Brethren,</hi> upon the minds of ſuch
hearers as will believe them, and receive the Impreſs.</p>
                  <p>3. They hereby fill Families, Cities, and Countries,
with all that Spawn of ugly ſins, which are the genuine
Fruits of ſuch hatred and contempt, and keep men alſo
from <hi>Repentance</hi> for any thing that they have ſaid or
done (how cruelly ſoever) againſt ſuch Miniſters, and
others, as are repreſented as ſo odious to them.</p>
                  <p>4. They hereby fortifie the Peoples Souls againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
converting, or edifying inſtruction, by ſuch
accuſed Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>5. They furniſh Papiſts, Inſidels, and other Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
with Matter of Accuſation againſt one part of the
Miniſters and Servants of Chriſt: They are able now to
ſay, that ſuch and ſuch Proteſtant Clergy-men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
reported it.</p>
                  <p>6. They tempt the worſer and weaker ſort of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
to return the like meaſure to them again, and to
judge as they are judged: Satan hereby gets Matter for a
Temptation, to call the Accuſers <hi>Fools</hi> in revenge, to
bring them to the danger mentioned, <hi>Mat. 5. 22.</hi> and
to hate their Brethren for <hi>hating</hi> them, that they may be
<hi>as Murderers,</hi> that <hi>have not eternal Life abiding in them,</hi>
1 Joh. 3. 15.</p>
                  <p>7. And laſtly, they hereby perhaps quiet their own
Conſciences, and deceive themſelves; or at leaſt for a
while, with ſome, preſerve their Reputations, by making
it believed, that their <hi>Conformity,</hi> or difference from the
<hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> conſiſteth but in the rejection of ſuch
wild Opinions, as the Affirmers hold; and in being the

deceived Reader, to ſave his Soul from the mortal
ſin, <hi>of hating his Brethren wrongfully,</hi> which falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
would tempt him to be guilty of.</p>
                  <p>The Terms need little Explication: 1. We call things
here <hi>[Lawful</hi> and <hi>Unlawful]</hi> in reſpect to the Laws of
God: For as to the Laws of Men the Affirmation of the
Queſtion, were but a mad Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>2. We ſpeak of that which is <hi>Antecedently</hi> Lawful
as Cloathed with all its Accidents, ſave this ſubſequent
one (being commanded by Authority) And that the
Queſtion is, <hi>whether the Command of Authority be an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
that rendereth it Unlawful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. We take <hi>[Lawful Authority]</hi> to be a Tautologie;
(for all <hi>Authority is Lawful,</hi> being in the Senſe in the
Queſtion nothing elſe, but a <hi>Jus R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>gendi;</hi> and <hi>[Jus
Juſtum,</hi> or a <hi>Lawful Right]</hi> is a Tautologie: If it be not
<hi>Lawful,</hi> or a <hi>Jus,</hi> it is but equivocally called <hi>Authority:)</hi>
Yet becauſe the equivocal uſe of the Word, may to
ſome need ſuch an Expoſitory Epithete, it may here be
born.</p>
                  <p>And we ſuppoſe that the Word ſigniſieth <hi>[Authority
over the Perſons, and in General,</hi> over the Affairs in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
ſo that you may ſee firſt here what <hi>is not</hi> the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and thereby the more eaſily perceive what it is.</p>
                  <p>1. The Queſtion is not of a thing before Lawful
meerly as an <hi>Act in genere, vel ſpecie,</hi> but Unlawful by
<hi>ſome other Accident, e. g.</hi> It is Lawfal to kill, and to <hi>kill
a Man,</hi> (elſe none could be put to death for Capital
Crimes;) but it is Unlawful to kill <hi>a juſt Man:</hi> And if
Rulers Command it, it is ſtill Unlawful; but not <hi>becauſe</hi>
it is Commanded by them, but becauſe it is <hi>forbidden of
God.</hi> It is Lawful to <hi>forbear preaching,</hi> (elſe <hi>Women</hi>
might not forbear;) but not for a true <hi>Miniſter of Chriſt</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:63040:13"/>
to forbear it, when mens Souls notoriouſly need his
preaching, and he is able <hi>conſideratis conſideran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>is</hi> to
perform it: If <hi>then</hi> Rulers forbid it him, it is ſtill <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi>
to forbear; but not <hi>becauſe</hi> they forbid him, but
becauſe God <hi>Commandeth him in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon,
inſtantly to preach,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>2. The Queſtion is not of the Command of <hi>Uſurpers,
Civil, or Eccleſiaſtical:</hi> For <hi>their Command</hi> ſometimes may
make a thing Antecedently Lawful to become <hi>Vnlawful,</hi>
by Accident, at that time, and to that Perſon. As it is
Lawful in it ſelf to <hi>meet an Uſurper,</hi> and to put off the
<hi>Hat to him,</hi> and to <hi>give him Money;</hi> but if he by <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Authority</hi> Command the Kings Subjects to <hi>appear
before him</hi> as <hi>their King,</hi> or to put <hi>off the Hat</hi> in token of
<hi>ſubjection</hi> to him, or to pay him <hi>Tribute</hi> as his Subjects,
it is an Unlawful owning of him, ſo far to obey him.</p>
                  <p>It is in it ſelf Lawful to <hi>go to Rome,</hi> but not in <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Pope,</hi> who is an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> if he Command it us.
It is in it ſelf Lawful to take an <hi>Oath,</hi> yea an Oath of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
(viz. <hi>To the King:)</hi> But if the Pope, or one of
his <hi>Prelates</hi> would Command the <hi>Kings Subjects</hi> to take
an Oath of <hi>Obedience to him;</hi> yea, or to <hi>perform Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
as ſuch,</hi> it may become Unlawful ſo to own his
Uſurpation.</p>
                  <p>It is Lawful, and a Duty, to be juſtly obedient to a
<hi>true Paſtor,</hi> or <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the Church: But if <hi>Arrians</hi> be
obtruded on <hi>Antioch, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Eaſtern Churches, even by the Emperour <hi>Valens,</hi> the
Churches will reſolutely refuſe to obey, or hear them:
Or if <hi>ſede vacante</hi> one intrude without a true <hi>Call,</hi> and
will tyranically make himſelf a Paſtor, or is obtruded by
the <hi>Pope,</hi> or other Foreign Power, without the <hi>conſent
of the Church</hi> (either the <hi>Clergie,</hi> or the <hi>Flocks)</hi> or any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63040:13"/>
one that hath <hi>true power to chuſe him to that place or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
it may be a ſin to own ſuch an Uſurper, though by
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>3. The Question is not of men that have Lawful <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
and not <hi>over the Perſon in Queſtion:</hi>
The King of <hi>France</hi> may have Lawful Authority <hi>there,</hi>
and yet no Authority to Command us in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Nor is the Queſtion of a Ruler that hath Authority
in <hi>other matters,</hi> but not <hi>in the matters now in Queſtion.</hi>
For as <hi>Rich. Hooker</hi> ſaith, Though a man be a Lawful
Governour, yet if he extend his Commands beyond his
Authority, and Command that which he hath no true
power to Command, it is not diſobeying Authority,
therein to diſobey him: <hi>e. g.</hi> If the Judge of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Pleas</hi>
Command that which is proper to the Judges
of the <hi>Kings-Bench, extra proprium forum,</hi> they have no
Authority. If a <hi>Biſhop</hi> would command Husband-men
when to Plow and Sow, and with what Seed; and what
Cloaths to wear, and what Meat to eat in particular;
or all Phyſitians what Phyſick to give each Patient;
theſe Commands are <hi>Uſurpations,</hi> and make <hi>no Duty:</hi>
Nay unleſs <hi>greater Accidents preponderate</hi> to make the
<hi>thing needful</hi> on ſome other accounts, it may do ſomewhat
towards the making of an Act otherwiſe Lawful to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Unlawful,</hi> when the doing it will <hi>encourage and
ſtrengthen ſuch Uſurpers,</hi> and be a <hi>ſcandalous ſeeming</hi> to
own their Uſurpation. So if a Juſtice would preſume
to arrogate the power of a Judge, or a Conſtable of a
Juſtice, or a Church-warden of a Conſtable, or a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
of the Paſtors of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe it ſeemeth doubtful, whether the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be of one that hath Authority to Command the
<hi>Lawful thing in Queſtion;</hi> or only of one that hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63040:14"/>
in <hi>General, whether his Authority extend to the
Point in Queſtion:</hi> and if not, <hi>whether his Command
make the Act Unlawful to be done:</hi> We ſhall include
what we aſſert in theſe Propoſitions, which will ſhew
what it is that we deny.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. 1.</hi> To queſtion whether it be Lawful, yea or a Duty,
to obey them Whom we ſuppoſe to have Authority to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the very thing queſtioned, is but to queſtion the ſame
thing which we firſt affirm; and to deny it, is to deny what
we firſt affirm.</p>
                  <p>For to have <hi>Authority to Command</hi> an Action, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but to have Authority to <hi>oblige me to do that
Action</hi> by Command. And is it a wiſe Mans Queſtion,
whether he that hath Authority to oblige me by his
Command to do an <hi>Action,</hi> doth not, by making it my
Duty, make it become Unlawful? That is, whether
<hi>Duty</hi> be <hi>Sin,</hi> whether Life be Death, and Light be Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
Why ſhould Men be feigned ſo mad, as to argue at
this rate?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. 2.</hi> If the Queſtion be, whether any Ruler have
power to Command a thing which would be no Duty, but
indifferent, if he did not Command it? It is to question
that which all ſober Perſons muſt aſſert, in the disjunctive
uſe of Things, or Actions, as to each other. <hi>That is,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Nothing is to be done or commanded, that is not
<hi>good before,</hi> or <hi>made good and uſeful by the Command:</hi>
Idle Laws are not good, if idle words be bad.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>End and Benefit</hi> of an Action may be <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and the <hi>commanding</hi> of an Action or Circumſtance
before indifferent, (comparatively as to others,) may be
<hi>disjunctively neceſſary,</hi> (either <hi>this or that;)</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
taken away, and the thing made <hi>both Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and Morally good,</hi> by the Determination of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:63040:14"/>
For Inſtance: It is <hi>neceſſary</hi> that the <hi>Army keep toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and march in Unity and Order:</hi> It is therefore <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
that they all meet, or Rendezvous at <hi>one determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
certain place;</hi> and it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> that they meet at
one determinate <hi>certain time, or day:</hi> It is therefore <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
that <hi>one certain place and time be determined:</hi> By
<hi>Conſent</hi> it will not be: It is therefore <hi>neceſſary</hi> that it be
done by <hi>Command.</hi> None of this is <hi>indifferent:</hi> But the
<hi>place, and day,</hi> may be antecedently ſo indifferent, that no
Man can ſee a Reaſon, <hi>why one, rather than the other</hi>
ſhould be <hi>choſen;</hi> no more than why of two equal
Eggs I ſhould chuſe this, rather than the other. In this
caſe it is not properly <hi>chuſing,</hi> but <hi>taking:</hi> I do not
<hi>chuſe</hi> this <hi>rather</hi> than <hi>the other,</hi> there being no <hi>preſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
of <hi>Eſteem;</hi> but only I <hi>take this, and not the other;</hi>
becauſe <hi>I muſt take one,</hi> and I <hi>muſt take but one.</hi> And
when the indifferent <hi>Place and Time</hi> is determined of,
it <hi>then,</hi> and <hi>thereby,</hi> is made <hi>profitable to the End,</hi> which is
<hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi> Thus far things <hi>neceſſary in genere
(this or that disjunctively)</hi> and <hi>unneceſſary</hi> antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>particular (this</hi> no more neceſſary than <hi>that,)</hi> may
be commanded by Authority, and are <hi>thereby</hi> made <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
uſeful,</hi> and <hi>Morally the Subjects Duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. 3.</hi> If the Queſtion be only in matters of God's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
or Religion, whether the ſame hold there; we affirm
that it there holdeth alſo. <hi>Which we thus explain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. No Ruler hath Authority to forbid what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth,
or to command what God forbiddeth, as to
Action, or any Circumſtance of an Action.</p>
                  <p>2. No Man can command by pretence of an Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
co-ordinate with God's, but only derived, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate.</p>
                  <p>3. No Man can do any thing which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63040:15"/>
to himſelf as his own proper work; as to
make Univerſal Laws for the whole World, or Church;
to make another Goſpel, Divine Covenant, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Gods Covenant; to add to, or diminiſh, or
alter the Word of God; to alter the Miniſtry, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
or Laws which he hath made, or to make the like;
or to change his Inſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>4. No Man can command any thing, but what God
giveth him Authority to command; for there is no
Power but of God.</p>
                  <p>5. But God giveth Men Authority to command things
<hi>before indifferent in his Worſhip,</hi> ſuch as we before deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
about Civil or Military things: That is, It is <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi>
that the Worſhip of God be <hi>orderly</hi> performed in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Aſſemblies; and that <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> be there
kept: It is therefore neceſſary that many meet in the
<hi>ſame Place,</hi> and the <hi>ſame Time,</hi> and uſe the <hi>ſame Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Scripture at that time, and the <hi>ſame Metre</hi> and
<hi>Tune</hi> of Pſalms, and hear the <hi>ſame Preacher</hi> on the <hi>ſame
Text,</hi> and the <hi>ſame Sermon;</hi> and that the Preacher at
<hi>that time</hi> uſe the <hi>ſame words and Method of Prayer and
Sermon to them all,</hi> whether by Notes, or without, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But whether it be <hi>this place or that, this day and hour or
that; this Tranſlation, Metre, Tune, or that; this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Text, Method, words, or that,</hi> may be <hi>indifferent
before, and needful and a Duty</hi> to the People <hi>after the
Determination</hi> of the Ruler, to whom it doth belong.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. 4.</hi> If a Ruler do not Act quite out of the Matter or
Circuit of his own Juriſdiction, about a thing which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
not to him, nor by his Determination of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
ſubvert the thing Circumſtantiated, and the very
End or Work it ſelf; though he miſs it in a Work which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to his Office, and do it not the beſt way, but be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63040:15"/>
in his Command, the Subject yet may be bound to do
what is ſo commanded, and is not excuſed by the faulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Rulers determining Commands. <hi>Which we
thus explain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. It belongeth not to a King to <hi>govern a Mans
thoughts.</hi> Therefore if he make Laws for our <hi>thoughts,</hi>
it is doubted by many, whether they oblige; unleſs as
he is the Official Promulgator of <hi>God's Laws,</hi> or <hi>exhort</hi>
Men to <hi>obey them:</hi> Yet knowing that he <hi>is God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
for our good,</hi> if he ſhould Miniſterially command us
not to think ill of God, or well of wickedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we
will not concur with thoſe that affirm, that <hi>no ſecondary</hi>
Obligation ariſeth from his Command; as long as we all
hold, that if a <hi>Church-Paſtor Miniſterially as Chriſt's Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>
forbid blaſphemous, malicious, filthy thoughts,
and <hi>Command</hi> holy meditation, and mental Prayer and
Thanksgiving, <hi>his Miniſterial</hi> Command hath an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
Obligation. It ſufficeth us therefore to ſay, that
Kings cannot <hi>puniſh Men,</hi> or <hi>reward them</hi> for their
<hi>thoughts;</hi> which is from their <hi>Natural Incapacity</hi> of <hi>knowing</hi> them: For could they <hi>know</hi> a <hi>Thoughtful Plot
of Treaſon,</hi> or a <hi>wiſe</hi> and honeſt <hi>contrivance</hi> or <hi>deſign</hi>
for <hi>Publick good,</hi> we cannot ſay that they might not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably
<hi>puniſh</hi> and <hi>reward</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>But to go to clearer Inſtances: It belongeth to the
King to give <hi>general regulating</hi> Laws to <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> to
<hi>Mariners,</hi> to <hi>Parents,</hi> to <hi>Nurſes,</hi> to <hi>Farriers,</hi> to <hi>Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Bakers, Cooks, &amp;c.</hi> He may forbid Phyſicians
the uſe of ſome dangerous Drugs; and Mariners ſome
times, and places, that are unſafe; and Parents, and
Nurſes, to give their Children ſome pernicious Food,
or wicked Counſel or Education; and Brewers, Bakers,
and Cooks, to poiſon Men, or deceive them in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63040:16"/>
of their Trades. But if he make ſuch Laws as take
theſe Mens Callings out of their hands; If he will chuſe
a Phyſician for every Patient, and the Medicines that
every Phyſician ſhall uſe, with Doſe, Time, and other
Circumſtances; and what Food every Parent ſhall give
his Children, with the Meaſure, Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo of
the reſt; This is to go beyond his Calling, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his true Authority, and ſuch Laws oblige not.</p>
                  <p>So if a King will give ſuch Laws to Chriſt's <hi>true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi>
as turn them <hi>out of their Callings,</hi> and take them
<hi>all upon himſelf;</hi> it is an acting beyond, and without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and doth not oblige. It is the Office of a <hi>Paſtor</hi>
of the Church, to <hi>have</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> the <hi>Keys of the Church,</hi>
to be the <hi>immediate Miniſterial Judge of Individuals,
who is to be taken in by Baptiſme, and entertained in holy
Communion, and in Sin called to Repentance; and for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency
ſhut out by Excommunication; and upon Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
reſtored by Abſolution.</hi> For the <hi>right performance</hi>
of all theſe the King may give <hi>general regulating Laws,</hi>
ſubſervient to <hi>Chriſt's Laws,</hi> to ſecure and promote <hi>their</hi>
execution; and he may forbid and puniſh groſs abuſes of
the Miniſtry, as well as of Phyſicians, and other Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.
But if he will uſurp the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in the Parts
aforeſaid, or take thoſe Parts out of the Miniſters hand,
and as <hi>Uzziah</hi> burn Incenſe: If he will chuſe for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
what <hi>Text ſtill to Preach on,</hi> and what <hi>Words in
Preaching and Prayer ſtill to ſay;</hi> and bid him <hi>inſtruct,
reprove, comfort, direct, baptiſe, abſolve no man but
ſuch as are named to him by the King,</hi> nor in <hi>any words</hi>
but ſuch as he <hi>preſcribeth;</hi> this being, 1. A <hi>deſtroying of
an Office of Chriſt's Inſtitution.</hi> 2. And an <hi>uſurping of it</hi>
without Chriſt's conſent; ſuch Laws oblige not, but are
null as to Conſcience, for want of <hi>true Authority</hi> in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63040:16"/>
Makers: As the Sentence of a Judge <hi>in foro alieno,</hi> or in
a Circuit, City, or Corporation, where the Power is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2. And if a Prince, or Inferiour Ruler, who hath
power to</hi> determine Circumſtantials <hi>about the Callings
of his Subjects, ſhall</hi> ſo determine <hi>them as ſhall</hi> overthrow
the very End and Work it ſelf, <hi>in a Calling</hi> which God by
Nature, or Scripture, hath made neceſſary; <hi>this Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
bindeth not, it being an Act without Authority:
For it is as true of Magiſtracy, as of</hi> Paul'<hi>s Apoſtleſhip,</hi>
We have this power for edification, and not for deſtruction,
2 Cor. 10. 8. <hi>&amp; 13. 10.</hi> Eph. 4. 12. 2. Cor. 12. 19.
1 Cor. 14. 5. 12. 26.</p>
                  <p>It is the pernicious errour of ſome Papiſts, to Dream
that their Pope and Church hath a Power of obligatory
judging in matters of <hi>Faith and Practice, in partem utram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet;</hi>
and in this wicked ſuppoſition they Cant over
and over to the ignorant, <hi>Who ſhall be Judge.</hi> To which
we ſay, That <hi>Publick Judgment</hi> belongeth <hi>to Publick
Perſons;</hi> that is, To the <hi>Magiſtrate [who ſhall have Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Communion]</hi> (even on Religious accounts,) and to
the <hi>Paſtors [who ſhall have Church-Communion;]</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Judgment</hi> (diſcerning each Mans Duty) belongs
to <hi>every rational man.</hi> But <hi>all men</hi> are Subjects of God,
and their <hi>judging Power</hi> is <hi>limited</hi> by his Laws.</p>
                  <p>If the Queſtion be, <hi>Whether there be a God, a Chriſt, a
Scripture, a Heaven, an Immortality of Souls, &amp;c.</hi> Kings,
and Paſtors, and Councils may, and muſt judge that
<hi>there is;</hi> but none of them may judge that <hi>there is not;</hi>
if they do, it's <hi>worſe</hi> than <hi>null:</hi> And in <hi>Practicals,</hi> if the
Queſtion be, <hi>Whether we may, or muſt pray for the hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God's Name, the coming of his Kingdom, the doing
of his Will on Earth as it is done in Heaven;</hi> or whether
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63040:17"/>
we muſt <hi>love</hi> and <hi>worſhip God,</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> him, and <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate

<hi>may, or muſt Preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon;</hi> and ſeek
to <hi>inſtruct and ſave Mens Souls;</hi> whether we muſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
our Parents, relieve the Poor, and ſave Mens lives,
in danger, from Murderers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They have Authority
to judge <hi>affirmatively,</hi> but none at all to judge <hi>negatively;</hi>
which if they do, it's worſe than <hi>null.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So Kings and Paſtors have power to judge that we</hi>
may not take God's Name in vain, nor be perjured, nor
prophane his ſeparated day, nor forſake the aſſembling of
our ſelves for his Publick Worſhip, nor Murder, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Adultery, nor ſteal, nor lye, or bear falſe witneſs,
nor perſecute, nor hurt any man injuriouſly; <hi>but they
have no power to judge that we</hi> may do any one <hi>of theſe:
and if they ſo judge, or command, it is a</hi> nulli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>y <hi>to the</hi>
Subject, and worſe to themſelves. <hi>God hath made no
men</hi> abſolute Judges, <hi>but given them a</hi> Regulating and
Limiting Law to Judge by.</p>
                  <p>Even ſo thoſe Rulers who have Power to Judge and
Command ſome <hi>Circumstances of Divine Worſhip,</hi> they
have it but as a <hi>means of promoting that Worſhip, and its
Ends,</hi> by the means of <hi>Edifying-Order;</hi> and they have
no Power to <hi>deſtroy the Worſhip, or its Ends.</hi> For Inſtance,
whoever hath Power to determine of the <hi>Place of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip,</hi> hath that Power for the <hi>Worſhip, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers</hi>
ſake; and is to be obeyed when he doth it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
But if he Command a thouſand Perſons to
meet no where but in a Room that will not hold two
hundred, or three hundred; or fifty thouſand Perſons to
meet no where but in one Temple, where above three
thouſand cannot hear; this is, on pretenſe of <hi>ordering</hi>
and <hi>placing</hi> God's Worſhip, to <hi>forbid it to all the reſt;</hi> for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63040:17"/>
which God never gave him Power: So alſo it is, if he
command them to meet no where but forty, or thirty, or
twenty miles off from their Habitation, or where they
cannot go without deſtroying the <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So whoever hath Power to chuſe the <hi>Day,</hi> or the
<hi>Hours</hi> of God's Publick Worſhip, hath this Power for
the <hi>Work ſake,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples edification;</hi> and is to be
obeyed when his Commands are anſwerable. But if he
ſhould Command Men to worſhip God only <hi>once a Year,</hi>
or <hi>once a Month;</hi> or to do it only at <hi>Mid-night,</hi> and ſo
<hi>deſtroy the Work</hi> by <hi>ill-timing</hi> it; this is a <hi>nullity,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Act without Authority, and worſe, as againſt the
Laws of God.</p>
                  <p>So whoever it be that hath Power to appoint <hi>Paſtors
and Teachers</hi> to the Churches or Publick Aſſemblies,
if they ſhould, as <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> ſend <hi>Arrians</hi> to
be Biſhops, or any other intollerable Perſons, who
through utter <hi>inſufficiency, Hereſie,</hi> or <hi>Malignity</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable,
and will do more hurt than good; or if they
would limit the Churches, or Countries, to an utterly

ſuch uncapable Perſons;</hi> or <hi>no more than one to fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Souls,</hi> or where <hi>ten or twenty are neceſſary;</hi> this is
to <hi>forbid Preaching,</hi> or <hi>corrupt it,</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> Mens
<hi>Souls</hi> on pretenſe of Order: And it is a nullity, and
worſe.</p>
                  <p>So if the ſame Rulers ſhould ſay, that, <hi>You ſhall Preach
only in Country Villages,</hi> but not within <hi>many miles of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or Corporations,</hi> which <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>notoriouſly want
your Preaching;</hi> this were but to <hi>forbid ſuch Cities, and

and the Miniſters to Preach it; and is a nullity and

and againſt his Laws.</p>

3. But if <hi>true Rightful Governours,</hi> who have <hi>Power
to determine Circumſtantials, Civil, or Religious,</hi> ſhall
<hi>miſ-determine them;</hi> yet ſo as <hi>not to deſtroy the Work,</hi> or

God; here their fault will not diſoblige us from the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

we may be yet obliged to do what they Command us.
For Inſtance,</p>
                  <p>The Ruler chuſeth a <hi>Place leſs convenient,</hi> that hath

<hi>a tollerable,</hi> but not the <hi>beſt Tranſlation of the Scripture,
and Metre</hi> of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> or <hi>Tunes,</hi> to be uſed; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth
a <hi>Bible</hi> of a <hi>worſer Print;</hi> and (ſuppoſing him

but <hi>[Though it be ſuch;]</hi> not <hi>qua</hi> but <hi>quod incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Reaſons are, 1. An <hi>inconvenient ill-choſen
Place, Time, Text, Tranſlation, Metre, Tune, &amp;c.</hi>
may be good as a <hi>means of Union and Concord in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
which without that would not be had; and that
<hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> is a Duty: Therefore ſo is the <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
means,</hi> though it be not <hi>the beſt</hi> that could be choſen.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63040:18"/>
If the People will not join with that <hi>Tranſlation, Metre,
Tune, Subject, Place, Time,</hi> which the Miniſter uſeth,
or chuſeth, they cannot join with him in the <hi>Worſhip.</hi>
Were there no Interpoſition of Authority, but mens <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi>
if a <hi>thouſand</hi> of the People are for a <hi>leſs conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
means, (Time, Place, &amp;c.)</hi> and a <hi>ſmall part</hi> for a
<hi>more convenient,</hi> they cannot concur but in ſome agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And if the miſtaken part will not yield to the
other, when <hi>Unity is neceſſary,</hi> for that <hi>Unity ſake</hi> the
reſt muſt yield to them.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The</hi> leſs convenient <hi>way may</hi> accidentally <hi>become
a means to</hi> avoid Perſecution, <hi>and the</hi> loſs of all their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Publick Advantages; <hi>and they that</hi> refuſe that

                  <p>3. The <hi>General Obligation to obey our Governours,</hi> is
not nullified by every miſtake in the Law or Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For all Mankind being imperfect, it is ſuppoſed
that all Government by Man is imperfect: If we ſhould
forbear <hi>praying</hi> till we can pray without all ſin, we
ſhould never pray; and if we ſhould forbear <hi>obeying</hi> till
Rulers Commands be <hi>perfect,</hi> or <hi>blameleſs,</hi> we ſhould <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Bible, every Verſion of the Pſalms, every Sermon and
Prayer,</hi> that we hear, or make; and in every <hi>Book</hi> that
we <hi>Write,</hi> and <hi>Read.</hi> If no Parent, Teacher, Maſter,

as have <hi>no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

or at an End.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> No Man is bound to that which is evil.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>It may be</hi> evil <hi>in the</hi> Commander, <hi>and</hi> good
<hi>in the</hi> Obeyer: <hi>Not that the</hi> ſame thing is good to one, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63040:19"/>
ill to the other <hi>(though in other Inſtances that often fall
out;)
for it is</hi> not the ſame thing: <hi>To</hi> Command <hi>an</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connveient
Time, Place, Tranſlation, Tune, &amp;c. <hi>is</hi> one
Action, <hi>and to</hi> obey that Command <hi>is</hi> another.</p>
                  <p>2. We obey it not as <hi>evil,</hi> but as <hi>good:</hi> The <hi>inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Time, Place, &amp;c.</hi> is <hi>not good</hi> as <hi>inconvenient,</hi> but
as a <hi>means of Order and Concord,</hi> and ſo we uſe it. And
the <hi>General Nature of Obedience</hi> is good; and if we
muſt do <hi>no good,</hi> which we cannot do without <hi>ſome adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
evil,</hi> we muſt <hi>never Pray, Preach, Eat, Drink, or
Trade more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. 5.</hi> if a Ruler go beyond (and ſo without) his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
yet in ſeveral Caſes we may be bound to do what he
Commandeth, as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>For Inſtance, In caſe the thing be in it ſelf <hi>good,</hi> or at
leaſt <hi>indifferent and Lawful;</hi> and the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
or the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Society dependeth on our <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
obeying him: It is our Duty to <hi>honour the King,</hi> and
our <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and to avoid all things that will
<hi>diſhonour</hi> them; or that will encourage others in diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
or diſorder the Society. If therefore it were
granted to be the <hi>Paſtors Duty,</hi> and not <hi>the Kings, toword
our Prayers and Sermons, and chuſe Tranſlations, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Metres, Tunes, &amp;c.</hi> yet if the <hi>King do it,</hi> though
<hi>beyond his Calling;</hi> that is, <hi>If he appoint us what Chapter
to read every day in Publick, and Command ſome Prayers to
be read, and ſome Homilies, or Printed Sermons to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
read,</hi> which are <hi>all good and lawful in themſelves,</hi>
not deſtroying the <hi>Office of the Miniſtry;</hi> and if by him,
or the People, it be taken for <hi>Contempt,</hi> and a <hi>diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him,</hi> to diſobey him, the <hi>General Command of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King,</hi> will here oblige us to the Commanded
Action.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:63040:19"/>
And if the Queſtion be, Whether this be <hi>formal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
or only <hi>material?</hi> We Anſwer, 1. It is but <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi>
and not <hi>formal Obedience, de ſpecie,</hi> properly as it is
to a Command that is <hi>without Authority to that thing.</hi>
But, 2. It partaketh of <hi>formal Obedience</hi> as to the <hi>Genu,</hi>
in as much as we do it for the <hi>honour of a Ruler,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is his Command who hath Authority to <hi>Govern
us,</hi> though not to do it <hi>by this miſtaken Action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. 6.</hi> If a Rightful Ruler ſhould go quite beyond the
bounds of his Authority, ſo far as that his Command did
not at all bind us, yet would it not make an indifferent
thing become unlawful, meerly becauſe he doth Command
it; <hi>what ever any other Accident may do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Proved, 1. Becauſe there is no force in the Inference,
<hi>[It is Commanded,</hi> ergo, <hi>it is unlawful.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Though his Act be culpable and without true
power, yet he is <hi>no Uſurper whom we are obliged to diſown;</hi>
and all true Governours have their faults.</p>
                  <p>3. The thing may be <hi>good,</hi> and ſo a <hi>Duty</hi> on other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
reaſons, <hi>viz. 1.</hi> As a means of Concord:
2. Of pleaſing others to their edification: 3. Of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
Superiours: 4. Of obtaining liberty, and
avoiding miſchief; and as <hi>ſuch,</hi> though not as an Act of
<hi>Obedience,</hi> may be a <hi>Duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Elſe it would be in the power of ill-minded Rulers,
to make all indifferent lawful things to be ſin or unlawful
to us, by Commanding them; and ſo to deprive us craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
of all our liberty, and make us Slaves. If Rulers
<hi>forbidding</hi> them, make not all things indifferent ſinful
(which many ſay) much leſs their <hi>commanding</hi> them;
elſe they might command inſtead of forbidding, and do
the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>We do believe that there may be found ſome Perſons in

the world of ſuch <hi>weak Underſtandings,</hi> and <hi>unruly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>

to do a thing antecedently indifferent, when it is
commanded them.</hi> Were we acquainted with ſuch a one,
we might ask him, 1. At <hi>what Age</hi> he would have Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
begin the practice of this Principle? Infants cannot
learn it. If before they can feed themſelves, they ſhould
refuſe Meat at the Hour when it is offered them by
the Mother, becauſe that Hour was antecedently indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
yea, if Children or Servants refuſe their ſet Meals
on that account, it were juſt if hunger teach them more
wit and obedience. If Children will think they <hi>betray
their Liberties,</hi> if they learn that <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> or <hi>words of
Prayer</hi> which the Parents teach them, (even <hi>ſet Forms,)</hi>
or if they will not read, hear, or learn, or pray at <hi>the Hour</hi>
appointed by their Parents, becauſe it was <hi>antecedently
indifferent;</hi> or if they will not go to the Church at the
<hi>Hour</hi> ſet them by the Miniſter, becauſe it was before a
time indifferent, how ſhould they be brought up in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord?</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>We would ask ſuch a one, Whether this be an obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that Command,</hi> Col. 3. 20. 22. [Children obey
your Parents in all things, for this is well-pleaſing to the
Lord: Servants obey in all things your Maſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Fleſh? <hi>Are</hi> things lawful <hi>none of the</hi> [All
things?]</p>
                  <p>3. If Obedience muſt be only to things <hi>antecedently
neceſſary,</hi> may not the Child in ſuch expect Obedience
from the Father, in ſome ſort, as well as the Father
from the Child? We mean <hi>material</hi> Obedience, that the
thing be done.</p>
                  <p>4. We hope they will not ſay the ſame to <hi>God,</hi> that
they will obey him in nothing antecedently indifferent:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63040:20"/>
And that is, becauſe the very <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
And if ſo, is it no ſubordinate <hi>obedience</hi> that is
due to Parents and other Superiors? <hi>Government, as ſuch,</hi>
can make that a Duty which <hi>antecedently was none,</hi> (or
elſe all Children and Servants live in conſtant ſin:) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Obedience, as ſuch,</hi> conſiſteth in obeying ſuch Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For though the chief work of all <hi>Rulers,</hi> is to
urge the obſervation of <hi>Gods own Laws,</hi> yet their <hi>ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary</hi>
work is (as Corporations have <hi>By-Laws</hi> about <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,</hi>
under the Univerſal Laws of the Kingdom, ſo)
to determine of <hi>ſubſervient Particulars.</hi> And if their
Principle practiſed in <hi>Families</hi> and <hi>Schools,</hi> would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all Family and School Order and Obedience, and
utterly ſubvert the Education of Mankind; let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
why it ſhould be brought into Kingdoms, Cities, or
Churches.</p>
                  <p>5. And we would ask them, Whether they live not
themſelves in the practice of the contrary? Do not all
Sects, even Quakers, meet at the <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> which
their Leaders do appoint them? Do they not hear the
<hi>words</hi> which the Leader chuſeth for their Ears? Do they
not command their own <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Children things</hi>
or <hi>circumſtances</hi> antecedently indifferent?</p>
                  <p>Did we hold ſuch Principles, we ſhould have leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

Accuſations againſt us, as Subverters of Government,

more tenderneſs it ſeems of their Reputation than of their

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 1.</hi> MORALITY is either <hi>Regulans,</hi> or <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata,
(menſurans,</hi> or <hi>menſurata:)</hi> The firſt is Radically in
God's own Mind and Will, and is called by many <hi>Lex

Subjects: Of theſe we are not now to ſpeak; that is, not
of the <hi>holineſs of God</hi> or <hi>his Laws,</hi> nor of <hi>Man's,</hi> as they
are <hi>truly a Rule</hi> to Subjects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Morality as Regulated</hi> is ſubjected in the <hi>Minds and
Actions</hi> of the Creature; ſpecially in the WILL, and
in our Actions, as VOLUNTARY; and ſo even the
<hi>Laws of Men,</hi> as thoſe Men are <hi>God's Subjects,</hi> and <hi>their
Laws</hi> are <hi>Actions</hi> good or evil, as <hi>Regulated</hi> by God's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Laws, are the Subjects of the <hi>Morality</hi> now in

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 2.</hi> This <hi>Morality</hi> in Man's <hi>Will and Actions</hi> is
nothing elſe, <hi>formally,</hi> but their <hi>Relation</hi> of <hi>Conformity</hi>
or <hi>Diſconformity</hi> to God's Law, as their Rule; (and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately
to ſubordinate Rules;) and <hi>materially</hi> to the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 3.</hi> How far this <hi>Moral Relation</hi> is immediately
founded in a <hi>Phyſical Relation,</hi> which is before it in order
of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſaid Relation of the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

to the <hi>End and Object</hi> as ſuch, antecedently to the
Relation to the <hi>commanding</hi> or <hi>forbidding</hi> Law, we
would willingly open, were it not leſt we ſeem, with
Men that love not much diſtinction, to juſtifie or excuſe
them that cenſure us as guilty of exceſs herein; and
we may do what is now neceſſary to be done without it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 4.</hi> No <hi>Being</hi> as <hi>ſuch,</hi> no <hi>Subſtance</hi> as <hi>ſuch,</hi> no
<hi>Habit</hi> as a <hi>Habit,</hi> no <hi>Act</hi> as an <hi>Act,</hi> is <hi>Morally Good or
Evil:</hi> For ſo they are but <hi>Quid Naturale;</hi> and God doth
not command and forbid <hi>Natural Beings as ſuch.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 5.</hi> All <hi>Moral Good and Evil</hi> is ſubjected in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Beings,</hi> or <hi>Privations,</hi> but not <hi>immediately</hi> as ſuch;
but as <hi>modified, circumſtantiated,</hi> and <hi>related.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 6. Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> make up <hi>all Morality;</hi> there
is no <hi>third Species:</hi> There are many things that are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi>
as to <hi>Morality;</hi> that is, neither <hi>Morally Good,</hi>
nor <hi>Morally Evil;</hi> but there is nothing <hi>Moral-Indifferent:</hi>
Meer Natural <hi>Beings</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> are <hi>Indifferent</hi> as to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality;</hi>
that is, they are <hi>not Moral:</hi> But <hi>whatever is
Moral,</hi> is <hi>Morally Good or Evil,</hi> and not Indifferent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 7.</hi> The Subject and <hi>quid abſolutum Fundamentale,</hi>
of all <hi>moral good, is, quid poſitivum,</hi> or a real Being; but
the <hi>Form of moral evil</hi> is ever found indeed in a real Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
but not always in a <hi>real fundamentum.</hi> For it is
(oft at leaſt) in <hi>total Omiſſions</hi> and <hi>Privations</hi> of the

or rectitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 8.</hi> Yet the <hi>formal relations of moral good and

whether they are equal or not, to guide my Progreſs, and

But this is only a chuſing to <hi>go,</hi> and a <hi>taking that way,</hi>

it. Here my Deliberation is a <hi>moral Act,</hi> and ſo is my

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 11.</hi> As the ſmallneſs of the leaſt <hi>Phyſical</hi> Being,
though undiſcernable, proveth it not to be <hi>Nothing;</hi> ſo
the ſmallneſs of any <hi>moral</hi> Good or Evil, (Duty or Sin)

for <hi>Habits, Diſpoſitions, Actions,</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi>

the Good or Evil is an <hi>Accident</hi> it ſelf, (for there is no

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 15.</hi> Any Man therefore that knoweth what true

Even <hi>Bonum &amp; Malum per ſe,</hi> is not ſuch <hi>Ver ſe qua ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiam,</hi>

So that the ſame which now is <hi>Bonum vel Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum

to a ſupervenient Accident: And excluding <hi>all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,</hi>
or all <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil by Accident;</hi> ſo nothing in
the World is <hi>Bonum</hi> or <hi>Malum morale per ſe</hi> (except
what is anon excepted. <hi>E. G.</hi> To <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>an Act;</hi> that <hi>Act</hi>

godly or wiſe, or as my King or Teacher, is to love him
for Accidents; that is, Godlineſs, <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> Authority,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is <hi>Bonum per accidens,</hi> and yet <hi>Bonum per ſe,</hi>
ſtating the Object thus, without farther Accidents. To
love him as an Enemy, and Perſecutor, and Silencer of
Godly Miniſters of Chriſt, is <hi>Malum per Accidens,</hi> and
yet <hi>Malum per ſe,</hi> in reſpect to farther Accidents. To love
the <hi>Man</hi> is not Evil, but to love him <hi>for his Evil.</hi> The
Exception here is, when we are bound to love the <hi>ſimple
Eſſence,</hi> as ſuch, abſtracting from all Accidents: The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Inſtance is of our <hi>love to God,</hi> (of which more anon;)
becauſe God hath no Accidents, and therefore is loved
meerly as in his Eſſence: And no doubt but God is to be
loved as in his Eſſential perfection. But yet we are nono
of thoſe that againſt <hi>Pet. Hurtado Mendez,</hi> and other
Nominals, will undertake to prove, that Relations to the
Creatures (which are Accidents) do not truly belong to
God; ſuch as that of <hi>Creator, Owner, Ruler, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
&amp;c.</hi> we leave that Task to the Thomiſts; and to
other Mens judgements how well they perform it.</p>
                  <p>The next Inſtance is <hi>(our love to Man as Man,)</hi> and
ſo to other Created Eſſences; which we deny not, but
add, 1. That Man's Relation to God, as he ſheweth his
Maker's perfections is a Relation, and that's it that is to
be loved morally in Man, at leaſt principally, and never
left out: The ſame we ſay of other Eſſences. 2. And
the <hi>Wiſdom, Goodneſs,</hi> and ſo the <hi>moral amiableneſs</hi> of
Man (at leaſt the principal) is it ſelf an Accident. The
Word of God, and the Worſhip of God, are Accidents.
But yet we ſay, that the propereſt Notion of <hi>Bonum per

as in the ſimple Eſſence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 16.</hi> This holdeth about the very Negative Laws
of the Decalogue, <hi>e. g.</hi> To kill a Man is in it ſelf no <hi>moral
Evil;</hi> elſe it were ſin to Execute Malefactors; and Kings,
Judges, and Souldiers were the moſt criminal ſinners:
To kill a Man Authoritatively, that is, a Traytor, or Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
is good; that is, an Act with its due Mode and
Object, which are Accidents that make it good. And
to kill the Innocent, or without Authority, is ſin by this
Accident, of an undue Mode and Object.</p>
                  <p>To take another Mans Goods or Money is not <hi>Malum
per ſe;</hi> for it may be done as a Mulct, or by Law on juſt
Cauſe, or for the Publick defence by Authority, or by
his Conſent: But to take it without Conſent, Right, or
Authority, is ſin by this Accident. So alſo of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Commandment. The Law forbids the Act as
Clothed with its undue Accidents. The Names of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
Coveting, Murder, Adultery, Theft, Falſe-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> all ſignifie the Acts with the undue prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Accidents. One of our Caſuiſts excepteth only <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
as ſimply <hi>per ſe</hi> Evil: But he that Lyeth, ſinneth
not becauſe he ſpeaketh <hi>thoſe ſame words,</hi> but becauſe he
ſpeaketh words that, in <hi>relation</hi> to his own mind, and to
the <hi>matter,</hi> and to the hearers underſtanding, are <hi>falſe</hi> and
<hi>deceitful:</hi> And that Relative Incongruity of the words

                     <hi>Prop. 17.</hi> Man paſſeth his life among ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of accidents and circumſtances, that it is not <hi>one,</hi>

                     <hi>Prop. 18.</hi> A chief diſtinction here to be obſerved, is
between <hi>Immutable Duties,</hi> (ſuppoſing our own conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Faculties) and mutable ones; and thoſe things are
principally or eminently called <hi>Good or Evil per ſe,</hi> which
are ſo <hi>immutably,</hi> and no ſupervenient accident can ever
make them otherwiſe: And in the moſt notable Senſe
thoſe things are called <hi>Good or Evil per accidens,</hi> which
by <hi>ſupervening accidents</hi> may be changed from what they
were before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. 19.</hi> That which is thus <hi>immutably Good per ſe,</hi> is
Mans Duty to <hi>God himſelf immediately,</hi> as he is our
<hi>Owner, Ruler, Benefactor, and End:</hi> Conſidering this
Duty not in <hi>this</hi> or that <hi>time,</hi> but <hi>in kind, in its ſeaſon;</hi>
and ſuppoſing our <hi>Faculties and Con-cauſes.</hi> For if a
Man ſhould be exerciſing even Love to God when he is
bound to ſleep for the ſupport of Nature, or if a Man
ſhould love God with ſo paſſionate an affection as would
diſtract him, this, as ſo uſed, is not good; but we never
knew any in much danger of ſo over-doing: Nor is it a
Duty for a Man in Infancy, or an Apoplexy, or deep ſleep,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> actually to love, fear, or truſt God; and in other
ſuch Caſes of Impoſſibility. But when <hi>poſſible,</hi> or in its
<hi>ſeaſon,</hi> it is <hi>immutably</hi> a Duty: Not ſo <hi>rarely</hi> as the Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſt
chargeth the Jeſuite Caſuiſts to hold, once in many
Weeks, or Months, or Years; but Love conſtraining us
to its holy Fruits, muſt be the very <hi>New Nature</hi> as it were
of our Souls, and the Buſineſs of our Lives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 20.</hi> That which makes this to be <hi>Bonum per ſe
immutabile,</hi> which no accident can alter, is, 1. Becauſe
the <hi>Foundations</hi> of our Obligations are Immutable, while
our Faculties and Powers endure (elſe they would ceaſe,)
for the <hi>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>itum</hi> is a Relation reſulting from the meer Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Poſition of the Humane Nature, as related to God:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63040:28"/>
And God will never change: Therefore unleſs Man ceaſe
to be man, or to be able to act as man, the obligation
can by no accident be changed. 2. Becauſe it is a duty
to the ſupreme Ruler and abſolute infinite Good; and
therefore the very performance of it is excluſive of all
changing accidents: For he that loveth God as a means
to his fleſhly pleaſure and proſperity only, and as leſs
good to him than the world, loveth him not as God:
And he that loveth him as God, loveth him as the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively
as to all Competitors, unleſs as this love is <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
defective;</hi> but that accident of defectiveneſs maketh
not our love to God to be a ſin, but the <hi>defe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>t</hi> of it as to
<hi>degree</hi> or <hi>frequency</hi> of exerciſe is the ſin. 3. And alſo
becauſe that God is the <hi>Final Object,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> the <hi>Final
Act;</hi> which together make up the ultimate end of man
(including the <hi>Viſion</hi> that kindleth love, and the <hi>praiſe joy,</hi>
and <hi>obedience</hi> which expreſs it:) But though mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> may
be oft changed, and may be <hi>too much</hi> loved, yet the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
end is unchangeable, and cannot be too much lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
(by true mental love, diſtinct from diſtracting paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;)
therefore our Obligations to it are according. So
that Love to God is the moſt immutable Moral Good.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame in their <hi>place</hi> and <hi>time</hi> muſt be ſaid of
holy <hi>Fear, Truſt,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to God, from which no
Accident can diſoblige us; no Command or Prohibition
of man; no ſuffering of body, or danger of life it ſelf;
much leſs the allurements of ſenſual delights.</p>

of things which the Obligation preſuppoſeth,
there the <hi>duty</hi> or <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> is by ſupervening Accidents
mutable: Even Inceſt, which is a hainous ſin, was a duty
to <hi>Adams</hi> Children, becauſe of accidental difference of
the caſe. The killing of an innocent Son, was well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to by <hi>Abraham,</hi> when the Lord of Life and of all
the world had commanded it; and that conſent was an
act of eminent goodneſs, and accordingly rewarded.
The borrowing of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Goods without intent to
reſtore them, and the robbing of them by taking them
away, was well done, when the abſolute Owner of the
World had by his Precept altered the Propriety. Thus
the altering of the Caſe may alter Obligations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. 23.</hi> But beſides the <hi>immutable</hi> Obligations to <hi>God
himſelf,</hi> there are many inſtances of our actions towards
<hi>men,</hi> and <hi>worldy Things,</hi> which are <hi>ordinarily unchanged;</hi>
and only ſome rare or ſupernatural declaration of the will
of God doth change them: For as God the Author and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
of Nature, ſheweth us by experience, that he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
much in the <hi>ordinary Conſtancy</hi> of his <hi>operations,</hi> and
<hi>rarely changeth</hi> the <hi>courſe of Nature;</hi> ſo there is an anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conſtancy in the <hi>ordinary ſtate and order</hi> of <hi>Things;</hi> and
conſequently of <hi>obligations</hi> or <hi>duty.</hi> And theſe are the
matter of Gods <hi>common univerſal Laws,</hi> which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
oblige all mankind; Theſe are the matter of the ſecond
Table of the Decalogue; and are ſeconds in point
of <hi>immutable Obligation</hi> to the firſt (mentioned) ſort (our
natural duty to God:) For though man be mutable, and
God immutable, yet God preſerveth ſo much conſtancy
in Humane Affairs, as is juſt matter of conſtant univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Laws, (though they are lyable rarely to diſpenſations
or exceptions.) And as not murdering, not committing
Adultery, not ſtealing, not lying, or falſe witneſs bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63040:29"/>
are ſuch, ſo alſo are the <hi>meer Poſitives</hi> of the firſt
Table, ſuch as are the acts of <hi>Inſtituted Worſhip,</hi> and the
holy obſervation of the Lords day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop. 24.</hi> The Caſes of Mans Life, which are more <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi>
are the matter of mutable <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> which
are moſt uſually called <hi>Good or Evil per accidens,</hi> becauſe
<hi>that mutable accidents,</hi> added to the more conſtant acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
make them ſuch by change. And ſo it is greatly to be
noted, that the Act which is a Duty to one Man, in one
Place, at one Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be a ſin to another Man,
or at another Time, Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that new accidents
may again come in, and make that Action, that was a ſin,
to become again a Duty: And more new accidents may
make it a ſin again; and ſo over and over: Even as
when you are weighing in the Ballance, one Grain may
turn the Scales the other way, and two more in the other
end may turn them back again; and three more in the
other end may yet return them, and ſo on many times
over and over. For Inſtance, Suppoſe an honeſt Man
cannot pray without ſome unſeemly faults in utterance;
in ſecret it is his Duty to pray vocally if that moſt profit
and affect his heart; if an exceptious Perſon be known
to over-hear him, it may be a ſin to do it audibly: If his
Family be capable of bearing it, it is his Duty to do it as
he can: If ſtrangers come in that would by ſcorn make
it do more hurt than good, he may be bound to forbear
till they are gone: When they are gone it is his Duty
again: A Fire breaketh out, or one falleth into a ſwound,
and it is his Duty to forbear: When that is over, it may
be his Duty again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>Pr. 25.</hi> Two ſorts therefore ſin againſt God, that

of their hearts and lives: And as Men picture <hi>Juſtice</hi> as
holding the Ballance, ſo ſhould <hi>Chriſtian Prudence</hi> be
thought on, even as judging of Good and Evil with the
Ballance in our hand, and putting every Grain of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
accidents into each end: And much errour, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoriouſneſs,
diſorder, and other ſin is in the World, by
ignorant Mens judging of things by ſome miſtaken word
of Scripture, without prudent weighing of Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and diſcerning which preponderateth: There were
Circumſtances in which <hi>Paul</hi> would ſhave his Head, and
Circumciſe <hi>Timothy,</hi> and become a Jew to the Jews;
and there were Circumſtances in which he ſaith, <hi>If ye
be Circumciſed Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing: Stand faſt in
the liberty with which Chriſt hath made you free.</hi>

                     <hi>Pr. 27.</hi> Hence the common People, who cannot be
expected to have a ſufficient meaſure of ſuch ponderating
Prudence, do need <hi>ſpiritual Guides;</hi> who ſhould be good
<hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> and endowed with ſo much accurateneſs of <hi>Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

difficulties, God doth not lay our <hi>ſafety, peace, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
upon ſuch degrees of accurateneſs and Prudence
as we cannot attain, though truly willing and faithfully
endeavouring it by ſincere diligence: Nor is God pleaſed
that Men be over ſcrupulous, or over ſolicitous, about
leſſer doubtful Circumſtances; that is, that we neglect
the Duty it ſelf, or too much delay it, or live in ſelf-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting
uncomfortable deſpondencies; making God's
ſervice burdenſome and grievous to us, either by an over
troubleſome and tedious care of ſome leſs accident, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we can do the work no more exactly: Like a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
that inſtead of his days work and journey, would ſit
down and ſpend half the day in crying becauſe he can
do no better, or in curious enquiries about leſſer Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:
But God would have us upon our ſincere wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs,
and a proportionable fidelity in enquiry, to do
his ſervice chearfully as well as we can; and to go on as
believing that we have a merciful God, a ſufficient and a
pardoning Covenant, and expect with joy his acceptance
of our ſincerity.</p>

                     <hi>Pr. 30.</hi> He that would tell Rulers that they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
command every thing which is not evil in the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical

not evil in the <hi>firſt</hi> Accidents or Circumſtances that

to ſave a Soul, or to build a Church may be a better

                  <p>

private Buſineſs; and yet private Men muſt not uſurp
it, but let it alone as no work of theirs. The Subject
muſt not take up the Rulers work, nor the Child the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

                  <p>

lawful: Nor will all <hi>ſcandal,</hi> that we foreknow will

Command in the offending Act. It is therefore a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of great difficulty and prudence ſometimes to diſcern,
whether the <hi>Rulers Command,</hi> or the <hi>ſcandalouſneſs,</hi> or

for <hi>[a ſeeming ſinfulneſs:]</hi> So a <hi>Scandal</hi> is ſaid to be

eſpecially a diſgraceful ſin: And a Man is called <hi>ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi>
and ſcandalized, when others (juſtly or unjuſtly)
report him to be a diſgraceful Sinner; and he is called a
<hi>Scandal</hi> in the place where he liveth for that Infamy:
3. The uſe of the word in the Goſpel is, for <hi>any thing that

<hi>that this School-diſtinction (of</hi> ſcandalum datum &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum)

                  <p>But we ſee no Reaſon to think, that the generality of

A man that either purpoſely or negligently ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
injurious provoking words, doth <hi>give</hi> the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

which in themſelves have no tendency to provoke, nor

<hi>give</hi> no ſcandal; (no nor he that juſtly and aptly reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:)
But a peeviſh or impatient ſinner may yet <hi>take

whether he do it purpoſely or negligently (that is by the

others will turn into an occaſion of ſin, he ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

that we are bound to deny</hi> no liberty, <hi>or</hi> nothing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>to prevent or cure the ſin of others, is to deny the
common Principles of Humanity; and on pretenſe of</hi>
Juſtice <hi>to renounce common</hi> Charity, <hi>and to become an
Adverſary to the great Precepts of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
Therefore the difficulty is to reſolve</hi> how far, <hi>and</hi>
in what caſes, our liberty muſt be denyed, to ſave other Men
from ſin; and conſequently from damnation; <hi>which muſt
be determined by the great General Canons:</hi> [Thou ſhalt

Mens Habitations, Charity requireth others to relieve

                  <p>Eſpecially where the Obligation is great and ſpecial,
As for Parents to feed their Children: If Rulers forbid
them, and ſo would have them murder them by Famine,
the Command is ſinful, and the Obligation null; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they cannot diſſolve the Obligation of God's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

And the exerciſe of Charity to <hi>Believers,</hi> that are the
Members of Chriſt, is a Duty that none may Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
and the Commands of none can diſoblige us
from: For <hi>Mat. 25.</hi> Chriſt tells us that he will judge

to everlaſting Life, or everlaſting Puniſhment. Yet
Chriſt foreknew, and foretold Men, that much of this
Charity muſt be exerciſed againſt the Wills of many of
the Rulers of the World.</p>
                  <p>Much leſs may Rulers prohibit the due exerciſe of

from the Goſpel, by committing a Kingdom or
County only to one Man:) So alſo if on pretenſe of any
croſs intereſt of their own, they would prohibit Chriſt's
Goſpel: Or if they will forbid Men to preach, becauſe
they will not make a Covenant againſt ſome Law of God,
or will not lye, or be perjured, or prophane God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
or own falſe Doctrine, or diſown the very Law
of Nature, calling this Non-conformity, Diſobedience,
or Schiſme. Yea, if they forbid neceſſary helps to Mens
Salvation, becauſe the Teachers be not all of one Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
about ſome unneceſſary Controverſie, or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
As if all the <hi>Lutherans</hi> would ſilence all called <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniſts,</hi>
or they the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or <hi>Arminians:</hi> Much
more unlawful is it for Rulers themſelves to be the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
of ſuch ſnares and occaſions of diſſent, and then to
impoſe them by ſuch penalties, that none ſhall preach the
Goſpel of Chriſt, that will not conſent to them, how
great ſoever the neceſſity be. As, <hi>e. g.</hi> God hath not
forbidden wearing a pair of Horns: If Rulers ſhould
make Laws that none ſhall preach the Goſpel that will
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63040:39"/>
not wear Horns in preaching, in token that the Word of
God ſhall puſh down the Powers of Sin and Satan, this is
an unlawful Command. So if on pretenſe of ordering
the Place of Worſhip, Men be commanded to ſuch a
diſtance, or confined to ſo ſmall a room, as deſtroyeth
the End of the Work it ſelf, and depriveth moſt of all
poſſibility of the Benefit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. 59.</hi> Rulers ought not to command any thing
which will notably do more harm than good, nor make
an unneceſſary thing a means or occaſion of excluding
the neceſſary Worſhip of God, or Preaching of his
Goſpel. Nor will their ſaying that <hi>neceſſary Teaching</hi> is
not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> or that <hi>they</hi> are the <hi>Judges of Neceſſity,</hi> or
that <hi>Hereticks</hi> are <hi>Orthodox,</hi> or the <hi>Orthodox</hi> are <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
or that <hi>Uſurpers</hi> only are duly <hi>called,</hi> and others
are <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> or that <hi>ignorant inſufficient</hi> Preachers
are <hi>ſufficient,</hi> or that <hi>more</hi> in <hi>number</hi> are not neceſſary,
when indeed they are; none of this will excuſe their ſin,
nor diſoblige Chriſts Servants from the obedience of his
Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. 60.</hi> If ſtill ignorant or fraudulent men ſhould ask
us, <hi>ad rancedinem uſque, who ſhall be Judge of Order and
Neceſſity,</hi> we again and again repeat our undenyable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
1. That the <hi>eſſe rei</hi> is before the <hi>ſcire:</hi> Either
the thing is really <hi>true and good</hi> which they judge <hi>true
and good,</hi> or it is <hi>falſe and bad;</hi> and no mans falſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will change the thing: <hi>(e. g.</hi> Our Preaching is <hi>ſound</hi>
and <hi>neceſſary,</hi> or it is not.) 2. The <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Judge</hi> who ſhall be <hi>protected</hi> or <hi>puniſhed by the Sword.</hi>
The <hi>Paſtors</hi> are the <hi>Publick Judges</hi> who is fit for Church-Communion,
and who not. And all the Subjects are
the rational Private <hi>diſcerning</hi> Judges of their Duty:
This no man can with a face of Reaſon deny. But all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63040:39"/>
theſe are Subjects to God, and limited by him in their
Judging Power, and not enabled to judge falſly, that
Evil is Good and Good is Evil: what Good is ſuch by
Nature or Accident, they cannot make Evil, and forbid
what God commandeth on pretenſe of judging. They
have Power to judge that all the Articles of our Faith
are true, but not that any of them are falſe: They are
Judges that the Commands of God muſt be all kept, but
have no power to judge the contrary. In what Caſes we
may be bound to obey them when they erre, we have
opened in another Paper, and may partly be diſcerned
from what is here ſaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. 61.</hi> The Biſhops or Paſtors of the Church are
above others obliged, to exerciſe paternal tender love to
all the Peoples Souls. If they are <hi>peeviſh,</hi> and <hi>humorous,</hi>
and <hi>quarrelſome,</hi> and <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>have other vitious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
it is their Office and Work under Chriſt to cure
them, and to uſe all that gentleneſs and forbearance which
is needful to their cure; and to become all things (law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful)
to all men, to win and edifie them: (not doing
<hi>greater hurt</hi> by injuring <hi>others,</hi> or the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> for
the ſake of thoſe that are <hi>few</hi> or <hi>leſs conſiderable.)</hi> If
therefore they ſhould either ſcandalize them and hinder
their ſalvation by things unneceſſary, or whoſe good will
not countervail the hurt; or if they ſhould ſay, we are
not bound to forſake our own <hi>Liberty</hi> (no not in a trifle)
for the ſake of ſuch as are inclined to offence by their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

their proper Callings, as well as Humane Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <head>What Meer Non-conformity is not.</head>
                  <p>THat we may not, after near fourteen Years ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
and ſilence, yet tell the World <hi>what
our Non-conformity is,</hi> without offending our
Superiours, and incurring all the cenſures and
farther ſufferings which we have reaſon to expect, is more
grievous to ſome of us, than all the corporal preſſures by
Ejections, Deprivation of Maintenance, Proſecutions,
Fines and Impriſonment which we have undergone;
when we conſider not only that the little remnant of our
opportunities for Miniſterial Work, (the preſervation
whereof hath done much to reſtrain us) is by the Odium
caſt upon us made leſs profitable to Mens Souls; but
eſpecially, how many Thouſands do defile their hearts
with falſe uncharitable Conceptions of their Brethren,
and their tongues with falſe Reproaches, if not their
hands with cruel Proſecutions, becauſe they are falſly
informed of our Cauſe: When we think how Satan is
ſerved by this; how odious ſins are multiplied through
the Land; how Chriſtian Love is killed; and diviſions
made among all Ranks of Men, and in all places: When
we think how God is hereby provoked, the Land diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
and endangered; and how faſt the guilty poſt
one after another into another World, where ſuch work
will coſt them dear; with many a heart-tearing groan
ſome of us have long ſaid, Muſt we be ſilent and ſee all
this? In a Chriſtian ſtate, muſt we be condemned, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63040:43"/>
driven about as Rogues and ſeditious Perſons,
and our Miniſtry vilified, and that by Clergy-men, who
think that it is their right to be believed, and not have
leave once to ſpeak for our ſelves, ſo far as to tell men,
<hi>what it is</hi> that we take for ſin? and <hi>why</hi> muſt we ſee ſo
many Thouſands going in ſuch guilt into another World,
and diſtracting a Kingdom that hath been too long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted,
and weakening both the Proteſtant and the
Chriſtian Intereſt, and by building and keeping up a
Wall of ſeparation, ſerving the great Enemy of both?
and muſt we not in compaſſion ſpeak for peace, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay as Chriſt, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not
what they do?</hi> If God forgive Men he turneth their hearts,
and giveth them Repentance. And we are commanded
to pray, <hi>Forgive our enemies, perſecutors, and ſlanderers,
and turn their hearts:</hi> And muſt we pray, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour?</p>
                  <p>At leaſt, now at laſt, we ſhall endeavor to <hi>ſtop</hi> them
by this ſhort <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> from believing thoſe Tongues or
Pens which tell them, that we make a <hi>Schiſme</hi> for things
which <hi>our ſelves confeſs Indifferent,</hi> and that our Non-conformity
conſiſteth in what it doth not: If we muſt
not tell them <hi>what it is</hi> that we think <hi>men command</hi> and
<hi>God forbids,</hi> we may tell them <hi>what it is not:</hi> For this
may be ſome ſervice to <hi>themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we muſt premiſe, that if any that are called by
<hi>other names,</hi> denoting other Opinions beſides <hi>Meer Non-conformity,</hi>
or any Perſons elſe whoſoever, do hold any
thing <hi>unlawful</hi> which <hi>we</hi> here <hi>allow,</hi> it is none of our
meaning to declare <hi>their judgements,</hi> which they are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
to declare themſelves: We profeſs but <hi>our own,</hi> and
ſuch as by familiarity we have had opportunity to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:63040:43"/>
Three ſorts we muſt here juſtifie our ſelves againſt,
who we know are likely to accuſe us upon unjuſtifiable
accounts: I. Thoſe that will be angry that we ſo far
undeceive the People, as to acquaint them with our
judgement, and the untruth of what they have believed
of us: How many ſoever may be guilty of this, it is ſo
<hi>diabolical</hi> that we ſuppoſe few will own it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we need not any farther diſpute it, than to tell them
that worldly intereſt, and wicked means will ſerve Mens
turns but a little while.</p>
                  <p>II. Thoſe that will ſay that <hi>we are not all of a mind;
one thinks more unlawful, and another leſs; and therefore
we are not to be united or agreed with, nor can it be known
what will ſatisfie us all.</hi> If the Churches Peace &amp; Concord
depend upon ſuch <hi>Heads, and Hearts, and Principles,</hi> as this
Objection doth imply, no wonder if it have no Peace
or Concord: We are united and agreed with thoſe that
differ from us in more than Circumſtances: We will
hold Concord with all in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi>
(if they will admit us without our ſinning) upon the
Terms ſet down by the Holy Ghoſt and the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.
15. 28.</hi> who would have nothing but neceſſary things
impoſed, (or ſuch things whoſo <hi>Determination one way
or other is neceſſary,</hi> though compared each with other
they are indifferent;) at leaſt not made <hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>Life,
Liberty, Miniſtry, or Communion;</hi> we have long learnt
from <hi>Rom. 14. 15.</hi> and from that Spirit which indited it,
not to judge nor to deſpiſe each other for things of tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
difference, but to receive each other as Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
us. One Man is not a Church, nor a Kingdom:
And if no Men muſt be of the ſame Church or Kingdom
that have any difference, yea as great as the Objection can
reaſonably ſuppoſe in the Meer Non-conformiſts, we are
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63040:44"/>
ſure that no two Men in the World can be of the ſame
Church or Kingdom, except you will Compoſe it of ſuch
as hold <hi>nothing at all unlawful,</hi> and conſequently nothing
morally good, which is no Church. We profeſs that
we love them as our ſelves, and ſhall not be guilty of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning,
undoing, ſilencing, or excommunicating
them, who wear not the ſame Cloaths, and uſe not the
ſame Geſture in ſinging, hearing, or reading, as we do;
who differ from us in the ſenſe of many a Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who take many things for duty or ſin which we do
not; who will not be tyed to uſe no Publick Prayers to
God, but what we or others write them down; ſo they
hold <hi>one Body, one Spirit, one Hope, one Lord, one Faith,
one Baptiſme, one God and Father of all, and will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the Bond of Peace,
Eph. 4. 3, 4, 5, 6.</hi> We are not for cutting off every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that is of different ſize or ſhape, <hi>1 Cor. 12.</hi> God keep
us from their <hi>mind and guilt and judgment,</hi> who will hold
Love and Communion with none but thoſe, in things <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary,</hi>
of their own opinion or way, or that would
ruine and perſecute all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>III. And ſome <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> that are <hi>more than ſo,</hi>
or <hi>differ from us,</hi> will ſay that we ſhould not have <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
thus <hi>our judgment,</hi> leſt by differing from them we
ſeem <hi>divided,</hi> and <hi>expoſe them</hi> to the greater Odium and
Perſecution, becauſe they cannot go ſo far as we.</p>
                  <p>But, 1. We proteſt againſt the perſecution of ſober god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Chriſtians, on the account of ſuch differences; and are
we then guilty of what we deprecate? 2. Did not Mr.
<hi>Eaton,</hi> when he wrote that the <hi>Oath of Allegiance and the
Covenant bind not,</hi> know that moſt of us were againſt his
judgement? To ſay nothing of many more that wrote
againſt Epiſcopacy, Presbytery, Infant Baptiſme, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63040:44"/>
Churches, <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> who yet forbore not on any ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts:
Did not Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> when they
wrote very well for the Oath of Supremacy, know that
in <hi>Scotland</hi> many refuſe it as unlawful? And did they
forbear for fear of bringing Perſecution on Diſſenters?
Did not Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> write to prove it lawful to hear the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Miniſters? and Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> write to prove it lawful
both to hear and to communicate with them? And did
the fear of bringing Perſecution on others hinder them?
3. Hath not this Reaſon (to keep others from Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
prevailed with us far enough and long enough?
4. Would they have us either by ſpeech or ſilence draw
men to believe, that we are of all mens minds whom we
would ſave from Perſecution? Muſt we tempt men to
think that we are Seekers, Quakers, Separatiſts, Anabaptiſts,
leſt we expoſe them to Perſecution? Is not this ſuch Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Policy, as if not repented of, will periſh with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of it? Even to do evil, and to tempt others to evil,
and to draw all our Hearers into ſin by our Example, by
making them think that we hold that to be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi>
which we do not? and all this on pretenſe of good?
yea to cheriſh the <hi>ſin of many,</hi> leſt <hi>ſome ſhould ſuffer?</hi>
5. The thing is unreaſonable, and the pretenſe is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
vain: For it is known by our Superiors that we
differ already; and yet they who make this Objection
have ſuffered never the more, but live a quieter life than
we have done. 6. If the Objection implyeth, as it
ſeems to do, that we are of their mind that will bear, or
live in Communion, with none but thoſe that differ not
from them, as far as the Objectors now ſuppoſe, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
their dividing Principles, and are not of their mind:
If they are not for <hi>loving</hi> Chriſtians as Chriſtians, and
uſing them accordingly, let them not expect that we
ſhould not ſeem to differ from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:63040:45"/>
And that we do not this that we do without reaſon,
we muſt thus ſhew:</p>
                  <p>I. It is ſinful when we can help it, to let Clergy-men
uncontradicted deceive Mens Souls, and draw and keep
both high and low, even many Thouſands in ſin, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
them that we are ſo ſchiſmatical and hateful a
People, that our ſufferings are no perſecutions, becauſe
we divide the Church for things indifferent, and ſtick at
nothing but Liturgie, or Forms of Prayer, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and that we hold Rebellious and Seditious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
or at beſt, have ſuch humours, fooliſh ſcruples and
ſingularities, as render us fitter for the Common Goal,
than the Church. Shall our ſilence contribute ſtill to
their deceit, and to the quieting of Mens Conſciences in
all that is done againſt us, as if it were good ſervice to
God and the King? Shall we have no pity on Mens guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Souls?</p>
                  <p>II. On the other ſide, we have long by ſad experience
ſeen, that the miſunderſtanding of the Caſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
partly of ſome of our judgments, hath led many of
the People who are againſt Conformity, to over-run
moderation, and the truth, and to run into unſound
opinions and ſingularities, and to lay heavier charges on
the Liturgy, and the Pariſh Churches, than there is cauſe
for: And having once <hi>over-run us,</hi> they expect that <hi>we</hi>
ſhould <hi>follow them,</hi> and be <hi>ruled by them;</hi> and if we do
not, are ready to cenſure us as guilty of ſinful Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and Conformity: It greatly concerneth us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to keep ſome from ſuch miſtakes, to rectifie others,
to vindicate our ſelves, and clear our Conſciences, that
we tell Men <hi>what our Non-conformity is not,</hi> if we may
not tell them what it is?</p>
                  <p>I. Our Non-conformity is not in holding that the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63040:45"/>
Scriptures are a <hi>particular</hi> Rule or Determination of all
the Circumſtances of Church-Government and Worſhip,
(as Time, Place, Utenſils, Words, Methods, Metres,
Tunes, Diviſion of the Text into Chapters and Verſes,
Tranſlations, helps by Notes, Written or Printed,
Geſtures, Habits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) But Nature and Scripture give
us ſufficient General Rules or Laws for all ſuch; as
that they be done in <hi>Unity, Charity,</hi> to <hi>edification,
decently</hi> and <hi>orderly, &amp;c.</hi> which muſt be obſerved.</p>

duty to obey and hold Communion with that Church,
ſo be it that nothing <hi>ſinful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>IV. We are againſt no Biſhops or Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods appointment: We all are for an <hi>Epiſcopus
Gregis;</hi> and where there are many Chappels and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
in a Pariſh, we are far from perſwading them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch ſubmiſſion to the chief Paſtor, as the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
and as God himſelf alloweth: Were <hi>Ignatius</hi> his
<hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> among us, who tells us this, as the Note of
the Churches Unity, that <hi>[to every Church there is one
Altar, and one Biſhop with his fellow Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons]</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:63040:46"/>
we ſhould be far from perſwading any to ſeparate
from it: Yea were it <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>Meaſure of Epiſcopacy.</hi>
Yea, there are <hi>ſome among us</hi> who have long profeſſed
themſelves uncertain, whether ſuch a large Epiſcopacy,
as is but the ſame with the <hi>ordinary part</hi> of the Church-power
of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, be not <hi>jure divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
ſuch as ſhould be ſtill continued; becauſe, 1. When
Chriſt hath once ſetled a Form or Order of Government,
a change muſt not be charged on him raſhly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
proof; eſpecially as made ſo ſuddenly: If the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmer
prove the ſettlement, the Denyer muſt prove the
<hi>Change</hi> and Revocation. 2. Becauſe Chriſt promiſed to
be with them to the end of the World, <hi>Mat. 28. 20.</hi>
when he appointed them this univerſal, or indefinite
Work. 3. Becauſe many others, as well as Apoſtles,
had larger Circuits than particular Churches for their
Work, (as <hi>Silas, Silvanus, Apollo, Titus,</hi> and many
more:) And at their Reformation the <hi>Scots Viſitors</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuch. That Men of extraordinary worth and gravity
may Plant many Churches, and take the care of many,
directing, exhorting, and admoniſhing the Paſtors, or
particular Biſhops, not depriving thoſe Paſtors and
Churches of the Power and Priviledges granted them
in Scripture, ſome of us do not deny. Government by
the Word is an ordinary continuing Ordinance of God:

endued with the extraordinary Meaſures of the Spirit)
theſe we believe they have no Succeſſors in, becauſe they
were but for a time.</p>
                  <p>And thoſe of us that cannot grant <hi>ſo much,</hi> as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
and all of us as to an <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> which we think

or dignified, who, <hi>circa ſacra,</hi> as Officers of the King,
do exerciſe any part of that Power of the Sword, by his
Commiſſion, which we acknowledge in the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy;
ſo if any uſurp more Power of the Keys than
Chriſt alloweth them, we are not thereby diſobliged
from living peaceably in our places, nor allowed to <hi>raiſe</hi>

                  <p>Much leſs is it true which M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>n of hard Faces have
ſometimes ſaid, that we are <hi>againſt Biſhops, becauſe we
cannot be Biſhops our ſelves.</hi> And they that tell Men that
every Presbyter would be a Pariſh Pope, do ſure think
they ſpeak to Men ſo ſilly as to be mockt by an undiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Contradiction: A Pope is the Univerſal Monarch of
the <hi>Chriſtian World,</hi> (or all:) Is a <hi>Pariſh</hi> all the World?
A Dioceſan is the Sole Biſhop with us of a <hi>Multitude</hi> of
Churches. Is a Pariſh a <hi>Multitude</hi> of ſuch Churches?
If a Man be againſt one Schoolmaſter only over a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Schools, ſhall he be reproached becauſe he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to <hi>teach one?</hi> Is a <hi>King in each Kingdom</hi> as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
a thing as a Papal Monarch, or a King of Kings,
and of all the Earth? If it be to the gain of Souls that we
are deprived of this Parochial Epiſcopacy, we can eaſily
bear it; profeſſing that we hold it far eaſier to be Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than to Govern.</p>
                  <p>V. We judge not all <hi>Officers, circa ſacra,</hi> unlawful
which are made by Man: As ſome <hi>Circumſtances</hi> are not
particularly determined in Scripture, but left to Men,
ſo are many of the <hi>Officers</hi> that muſt execute them. If
the King appoint <hi>Church-Magiſtrates</hi> to keep Peace and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63040:47"/>
Order, to call Synods, and take ſuch cogniſance of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
as belongs <hi>to him,</hi> or do any part of <hi>his work,</hi> as is
afore ſaid, we will obey them: And ſo of Church-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
Door-keepers, Sextons, and ſuch others, as ſome
Churches of old made uſe of, ſo be it they uſurp not
any part of the Office which Chriſt hath appropriated to
the Paſtors of the Churches.</p>
                  <p>VI. We are not for <hi>Lay-mens claim</hi> or <hi>exerciſe</hi> of the
<hi>Power of the Keys,</hi> whether they be <hi>Lay-Chancellors,</hi> or
<hi>Magiſtrates</hi> or <hi>Lay-Officers,</hi> or <hi>People:</hi> But we hold that
the <hi>Keys of Chriſts Church,</hi> that is, the <hi>Power of receiving
in by Baptiſm,</hi> and of <hi>Guiding</hi> the People by holy <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
and in <hi>holy Worſhip,</hi> and of <hi>Excommunicating</hi> and
<hi>Abſolving,</hi> are by Chriſt committed to the Paſtors of the
Churches. Though there is alſo an admoniſhing Power
in Magiſtrates, and divers ſorts of Penalties, for ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, which they may inflict. And the voluntary
<hi>execution</hi> of the Paſtors judgment, by holding or not
holding Communion with others, is the Peoples part;
in which, as <hi>reaſonable,</hi> they have a diſcerning judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>VII. As to the caſe of <hi>Elders,</hi> we all hold that none
ſhould be <hi>proper Church Governours,</hi> by the ſaid Keys,
which are meerly <hi>Lay-men,</hi> and not <hi>Church Officers:</hi>
And many of us hold that neither Chriſt nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
over appointed any Elders to Rule the Church,
by the power of the Keys (diſtinct from the Magiſtrates
Government by the Sword,) but only <hi>ordained Miniſters</hi>
of Chriſt, who have alſo <hi>authority</hi> to <hi>preach</hi> and <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
both the Sacraments.</hi> However, we know that
when many of theſe belonged to one Congregation, one
that was the Chief Speaker (uſually the Biſhop) was
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>nt to preach, and the reſt to be his Aſſiſtants, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63040:47"/>
in private Care of Souls; and thoſe of us that think
otherwiſe, that Chriſt or his Apoſtles made ſuch a
Church Office as <hi>Ruling Elders not-ordained,</hi> or that have
<hi>no power of preaching or adminiſtring Sacraments,</hi> do
not hold ſuch eſſential to the Church, nor refuſe to live
in love and peace and Communion with the Churches
that have no ſuch Elders. And we all think that ſo ſmall
a difference ſhould make no greater a breach among us.</p>
                  <p>VIII. We are againſt the Excommunicating of Kings,
and of other Magiſtrates, on whoſe Honour the well-governing
and peace of the Kingdom doth depend, (and
are ſorry to find ſome of our ſharp Accuſers of another
mind:) Our Reaſons are, becauſe the <hi>diſhonouring</hi> of
them is forbidden in the <hi>Fifth Commandment:</hi> And <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Inſtitutions, caeteris paribus,</hi> muſt give place to <hi>Moral
Natural Laws: Rituals</hi> and matters of <hi>Order</hi> are no Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
when they make againſt thoſe <hi>Grand Duties</hi> which
are their <hi>Ends,</hi> or thoſe that are of fundamental or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
uſe. And this Chriſt hath often taught us, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the contrary minded to learn what this meaneth <hi>[I
will have mercy and not ſacrifice,]</hi> and bidding the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciled
<hi>leave their Gift at the Altar, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>End</hi>
is to be preferred before the <hi>Means,</hi> which indeed are
<hi>no Means</hi> when <hi>against the End.</hi> And <hi>Church-Order</hi> is
not to be pretended for <hi>diſordering and confounding King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>
or againſt the <hi>publick good and ſafety.</hi> We judge
that Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> and ſuch others, have
truly heretofore determined, that ſome wicked impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Princes may be <hi>denyed the Sacrament,</hi> but not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed
or diſhonoured</hi> by a <hi>Sentence of Excommunication:</hi>
Much leſs by any <hi>Foreign Uſurper,</hi> or any <hi>Miniſter at
home,</hi> that the Prince himſelf doth not by conſent make
the Guid of his Soul; for no other but he that is called
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63040:48"/>
to <hi>give him the Sacrament</hi> if qualified, is the <hi>denyer of it</hi>
if he be <hi>unqualified;</hi> unleſs as he is to do what he doth, by
the advice and conſent of Fellow Paſtors.</p>
                  <p>But the very uſe of <hi>Excommunication</hi> is to puniſh and
reform men by <hi>diſhonouring and ſhaming them;</hi> therefore
it is not to be uſed, where we owe ſuch <hi>honour</hi> by the <hi>Fifth
Commandment,</hi> to our Prince.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj. 1.</hi> We are bid alſo to honour Father and Mother;
2. Yea to honour all men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We dare not juſtifie any Paſtors publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful
excommunicating his own Father or Mother,
unleſs where a publick obligation for publick good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
it. 2. But to both inſtances, we ſay that a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>end</hi> and more <hi>publick good</hi> is to be preferred to a <hi>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>s:</hi>
And when a <hi>private mans</hi> honour is forfeited, we cannot
give him that which he hath caſt away, and God will
penally take away till he repent. But when the <hi>publick
order</hi> and welfare (which is above all perſonal good) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
us to honour Magiſtrates, a ſubordinat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Law will
not ſuſpend it. Publick Excommunication is an Act of
Government, to be exerciſed on the Governed for the
Ends of Government. But for a Prelate or Prieſt, or any
other, to do this on his Governours (though of another
rank) croſſeth the Ends of Government: Nor are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſo to be tempted to contemn their Rulers, leſt they
come to think, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and ſuch Papiſts, that Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
are not to Govern Chriſtians, nor to be tolerated in
their Government; or as their very Religion teacheth
them, <hi>Concil. Later. c. 3. ſub Innoc. 3.</hi> that when Princes
are excommunicated, they may be depoſed by the Pope;
or as their learnedeſt Doctors ſay, that they <hi>are no Kings,</hi>
and to <hi>kill them</hi> is <hi>not to kill the King:</hi> See the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of this cited at large, and expreſly, by <hi>H. Fowlis</hi> in his
Book of Popiſh Treaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:63040:48"/>
If ever any Proteſtants Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,
were or be of another mind, (for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating
of Kings or Chief Rulers) that's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to us, who ſhall neither live nor dye by the Faith
or Opinion of others: But we ſhould ſo much the rather
here diſown it.</p>
                  <p>IX. It is none of our judgment, that when men are
excommunicated (by Pope, Prelates, Presbyters, or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who are the four Pretenders to that Power) the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
muſt be their <hi>Lictor</hi> or <hi>Executioner,</hi> or muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
puniſh men by the <hi>Sword,</hi> meerly, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe
they are <hi>excommunicate,</hi> or becauſe they reconcile not
themſelves to the Church, by penitence and obedience;
or becauſe the Pope, or Prelate, or Prieſts, deliver up the
excommunicate to him to be puniſhed, or threaten him
if he will not do it. The Civil Ruler may puniſh the
<hi>ſame men</hi> for the <hi>ſame Crimes,</hi> but upon their <hi>own explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
and <hi>judgment</hi> of the Cauſe, and not as meer
Hangmen that muſt needs execute the judgment of other
Judges. Their own <hi>Conſcience</hi> muſt be ſatisfied, and
they muſt know what they do, and why; elſe to how
many baſe and bloody offices the factious worldly Clergy
may oblige them, the Papal Kingdom hath long given
men too ſad a proof.</p>
                  <p>And we muſt profeſs, that we are fully perſwaded,
that we have good Reaſon to conclude, that ſo <hi>near a
Proſecution</hi> by the Civil Power, as is the <hi>impriſoning</hi> and
<hi>undoing</hi> of Perſons Excommunicate, meerly becauſe
they ſtand Excommunicate, and are not abſolved as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents,
hath not a few nor ſmall incommodities Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical.
1. So great a Dominion in the Clergy hath
done much to corrupt the Sacred Office, and make men
(naturally proud) unmeet for the humble Services of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63040:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Goſpel. 2. And it breedeth in the People a diſtaſt and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of the Clergy, as if they were the grievous Wolves
that devour the Flock in Sheeps Cloathing, and bear not
<hi>Grapes and Figs,</hi> but wear <hi>Thorns and Thiſtles</hi> to <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>ick and
hurt</hi> them; and cauſeth their Exhortations to be the more
unſucceſsful. 3. It ſeemeth to diſhonour the Diſcipline inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by Chriſt, as if the Keys of his Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>re of no

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Reed
with which he was derided, and could do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Princes Sword. 4. It contradicteth the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of above 300 years, when Church Diſcipline was
exerciſed more effectually than it is now, and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without the Sword of the Magiſtrate, but alſo againſt
his will and oppoſition: Yea, it was many a hundred
years more, after Emperours were Chriſtian, before the
Keys were ever thus ſeconded by the Sword; and had
not the Donatiſts, by inhumane aſſaulting the Orthodox,
provoked the Churches and Magiſtrates, it had been like
to have been long before the Sword had been drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Hereticks at all. 5. And that which much moveth
us is, that it greatly fruſtrateth the uſe of the Keys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
Church Diſcipline, by obſcuring the uſe and efficacy of
them: For who can tell whether they do any thing or
nothing to that mans ſeeming Repentance, who muſt
lye in Goal and be undone, unleſs he will ſay that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth?
Though the Church muſt take up with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Profeſſions, as not knowing the heart, yet muſt
they be voluntary and credible Profeſſions. 6. And thus
how unavoidably muſt the Church be corrupted, when
its Communicants are ſuch as chuſe rather to be in the
Church than in the Goal, and all thoſe are thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of its Priviledges, who had rather ſay <hi>[we repent]</hi>
than be made Beggars: Whenas in the ancient Churches
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63040:49"/>
none had its Communion that did not deſire it, and beg
for it, though it coſt them dear in the world. 7. And
thus Chriſts great and precious Gifts ſeem expoſed to
contempt, while they are forced upon the Refuſers by
ways of violence. If the Church be made a Priſon, and
men be <hi>driven</hi> into it and lockt up, the <hi>Place</hi> will hardly
prove them Chriſtians. 8. And we fear it will miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent
Chriſts Laws and Covenant-terms to the world,
while Chriſt ſaith, that none can be his Diſciples that do
not (by conſent and reſolution) take up the Croſs, and
forſake all, and follow him, in hope of a reward in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>(Luke 14. 26. 29, 30. 33, 34.)</hi> And this courſe
ſeemeth to tell men, that if they had but rather be in the
Church, than among Rogues and Beggars in the Goal,
they ſhall have Chriſt, pardon, and life eternal, given
and ſealed up to them particularly in the holy Sacrament.
As if Chriſt were the Croſs-maker, and the Croſs to be
born by his Enemies only, and not <hi>Chriſt</hi> but <hi>ſin</hi> were
ſerved by forſaking temporal felicity. 9. And we fear
leſt it tend to <hi>deceive mens Souls,</hi> by giving them all the
ſealed Grant of forgiveneſs and ſalvation, who can but
rather endure to take the Sacrament, and ſay I repent,
than be undone.</p>
                  <p>We doubt not but there is a time for juſt puniſhment
of ſinners: But we read not, that Chriſt ſent men to
preach <hi>Repentance</hi> by any ſuch motives, nor to offer his
Blood and Mercy on terms ſo low, nor to any but deſirous
Volunteers: And with what confidence or comfort can
a Miniſter deliver the Sacrament to ſuch?</p>
                  <p>All which conſidered, we are ſo far from deſiring to
ſubdue Kings and Rulers to be the Executioners of the
Clergy, and the Servants of their worldly Intereſt, Pride,
or Paſſions, that we heartily wiſh that Church Diſcipline
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63040:50"/>
might be left to operate alone, <hi>&amp; valeat quantum val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

poteſt,</hi> and that Church Priviledges might be given to
none but deſirers, and voluntary accepters, and none
might be <hi>cram'd</hi> or <hi>drencht</hi> with the <hi>Body and Blood</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> but all earneſtly invited, and by loving importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
compelled to come in: And that Magiſtrates may
judge and puniſh Vice, in their proper court, and proper
way.</p>
                  <p>X. We hold it not unlawful to take Oaths, and make
Covenants, Subſcriptions, or Declarations of things
lawful, when Authority commandeth us; yea, we hold
Oaths of Fidelity to the Soveraign to be needful; and
are the loather to ſwear Allegiance to any inferior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
or to <hi>ſwear never to endeavour any alteration of
them,</hi> leſt we ſeem to make them equally neceſſary and
fixed as the King; and to give them any of his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
when they are his Officers, whom he hath power
to alter.</p>
                  <p>XI. We readily ſubſcribe the Doctrine of Faith and
Sacraments contained in the 39 Articles, and differ not
therein from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that we know of.
Though our Religion is only (objectively) Gods Word,
(as to the Eſſentials, the Sacramental Covenant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in the Creed, the Lords Prayer and Decalogue,
and integrally the ſacred Scriptures,) and therefore if
there be any fault in the 39 Articles, it is no fault in our
Religion, (which is confeſſed to be all true by Papiſts
themſelves;) yet as our Writings, and Sermons, and
Speeches, are the expreſſions of our <hi>ſubjective Religion,</hi> ſo
the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of Churches are <hi>eminently ſuch;</hi> being
uſeful to ſatisfie other Churches of our ſincerity, and to
regulate or limit the Teachers, that by weakneſs or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
are apt to deliver their miſtakes, or to oppoſe the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63040:50"/>
Truth. And though there be ſome expreſſions in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
the Liturgy, yea in the Creed called <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s,
which we think not accurate, but lyable to an ill inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
yet when our Conſciences tell us that it was
truth which was intended, and words are not <hi>natural,
immutable,</hi> but <hi>arbitrary ſigns</hi> of the Speakers mind, we
are far from affecting to be peeviſhly or unreaſonably quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome
or ſcrupulous, but are willing to overlook infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and unfitneſs of expreſſion, when we ſee that we
are not to own Untruths.</p>
                  <p>XII. We much approve of the Method of the Church
Catechiſm, as it firſt openeth the Eſſentials of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in the Baptiſmal Covenant, and then the Expoſition
of it in the Creed, Decalogue, and Lords Prayer, and
then the uſe of the confirming Sacrament the Lords
Supper: Though we are perſwaded, that it needeth more
explication and ſome correction.</p>
                  <p>XIII. We are taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles uſing
of the Septuagint, that it is lawful, when the Peoples
uſage and acquaintance with it doth render it moſt edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them, to uſe a defective faulty Tranſlation of Gods
own Word, and to call this Gods Word, as long as it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently
expreſſeth the Doctrine, which is the matter and
main ſenſe. And that we may hold Communion with
Churches that publickly and privately uſe ſuch Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and that have many other faults in their Doctrine,
Diſcipline, and Worſhip; though we cannot juſtifie the
leaſt of them, by our profeſſed Aſſent and Conſent, nor
make a Covenant that we will never endeavour to alter
or amend them. We are apt enough to let ſin alone,
and not to amend any thing amiſs in our ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
ſo far as ſin remaineth in us (it being a ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>ending
evil,) and therefore are unwilling to adde to our
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63040:51"/>
badneſs, nor do we need a Law to bind us never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
or amend, or never to help others in ſuch a caſe to
do it.</p>
                  <p>XIV. We have in a peculiar Explication of our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not only diſclaimed, but ſufficiently depreſſed,
that unruly Opinion falſly charged on us by ſome, <hi>viz.
[That Things Lawful or Indifferent become Unlawful when
commanded by Lawful Authority.]</hi> Though we hold it
unlawful to encourage and ſtrengthen Traytors and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
againſt Chriſt or the King, by voluntary Swearing
or performing ſuch Obedience to them, even in <hi>licitis &amp;
honeſtis,</hi> as ſeemeth to own their Uſurpation.</p>
                  <p>XV. How far we think the Magiſtrates Laws bind us
to things Scandalous, or Evil and Hurtful by Accident,
yea by the Weakneſs of others, we are prepared to open
in a diſtinct Profeſſion by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>XVI. We are far from condemning all <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi>
and <hi>Publick Liturgies,</hi> as unlawful, (of which we have
His Majeſties Teſtimony, in his Declaration about Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Affairs;) much more are we far from condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the ancient and preſent Churches of Chriſt that
have uſed ſuch, or yet uſe them, throughout the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
world: And yet farther are we from <hi>ſeparating</hi> from
them on that account, (for uſing Liturgies,) and from
encouraging ſuch a Separation. Yea we commonly uſe
a <hi>ſtinted Liturgie our ſelves,</hi> at leaſt the <hi>Pſalms read and
ſung;</hi> and we hold it lawful to uſe ſuch as are <hi>invented
by men,</hi> that are no Prophets; ſeeing we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to uſe <hi>Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs,</hi> (which
confineth us not only to Scripture words;) and all men
have not the skill to make <hi>Hymns ex tempore;</hi> much
leſs would all the Aſſembly, <hi>ex tempore,</hi> break forth into
the ſame words: Therefore thoſe that are uſed by all,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63040:51"/>
muſt be <hi>invented by ſome:</hi> And Miniſters with us do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
impoſe their own invented words on all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
who muſt follow them; as our <hi>Metres</hi> and
<hi>Tunes</hi> of <hi>Pſalms</hi> are impoſed.</p>
                  <p>XVII. We think it not unlawful to uſe as much of the
Engliſh Liturgy, as we conſented to uſe, when by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Commiſſion ſome of us treated about the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or alteration of it; <hi>viz.</hi> in ſuch Aſſemblies where
the Peoples incapacity maketh not ſuch uſe of it more
hurtful than helpful to their edification, and the comly
concordant worſhipping of God: Much leſs do we think
it unlawful for our ſelves, or the People, in this caſe to join
in the reverent and ſerious uſe of it with others. We
find that even the old Non-conformiſts (ſuch as <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,
Hilderſham, Knewſtube,</hi> Dr. <hi>Jo. Reignolds, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,
Paget, Ball, &amp;c.)</hi> petitioned for a Reformation,
but not an Abolition of it, and wrote and preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſeparating <hi>from it,</hi> or <hi>for it,</hi> from the <hi>Churches</hi>
that uſed it; and many of them not only uſed much or
moſt of it themſelves, but alſo perſwaded to the uſe of
it, and anſwered largely the Separatiſts Arguments againſt
ſuch uſe. And we join with Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> and other of them,
in thanking God that <hi>England</hi> hath a more reformed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
than moſt of the Churches in the World; and
we would not ſeem to uſe it when we do not, but do it
(as aforeſaid) in the ſerious devotion and fervour of our
Souls: Nor would we peeviſhly make any thing in it
worſe than it is, but would put the beſt conſtruction on
each part of it, that true Reaſon will juſtifie or allow.</p>
                  <p>XVIII. We are far from judging the Pariſh Miniſters
to be no true Miniſters of Chriſt, or the Pariſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
no true Churches, or judging it unlawful to hold
Communion with them: But if there be any called Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63040:52"/>
or Prieſts, of theſe following ſorts, we take them
for no true Miniſters of Chriſt, <hi>ziz.</hi> 1. If by <hi>inſufficiency</hi>
they are uncapable of Teaching the <hi>neceſſary parts of
Chriſtianity,</hi> and Guiding the Church accordingly in the
Publick Worſhip of God. 2. If they are <hi>Hereticks,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
any of theſe <hi>eſſential</hi> parts. 3. If they are <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Oppoſers</hi> of the <hi>practice</hi> of them: And in a word,
If they are ſuch, through incapacity, as are like to do
more harm than good.</p>
                  <p>XIX. In ſeveral Cuſtoms (freely, not by conſtraint,)
uſed in many ancient Churches, and in ſeveral practices
of ſeveral Churches of theſe Times, we find that which
we would not by <hi>Oaths, or Subſcriptions, or Covenants,</hi>
approve, but with they were reformed, and that they
had never been uſed; when yet we do not for ſuch things
diſhonour and reproach ſuch Churches, nor inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them in our preaching to diminiſh their due eſteem;
much leſs diſclaim them as no Churches of Chriſt; but
love, and honour them; and live peaceably under many
faults which we cannot reform in the places where we
live: So be it no ſin be put upon our ſelves, we can hold
Communion with thoſe that have divers ſins, or faults,
in their Miniſtrations; not as with <hi>their ſin,</hi> but <hi>with
their Church in worſhip, notwithſtanding the ſin,</hi> ſo it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
not God's worſhip ſo far as that he himſelf rejecteth
it: For no Man is ſinleſs in his beſt performance.</p>
                  <p>XX. Though the Paſtors hold any <hi>tolerable errors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally,</hi>
and though ſuch are uſually uttered in their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration,</hi>
and though they be inſerted in their <hi>Liturgies,</hi>
ſo that we may expect to <hi>hear</hi> them; yea, uttered as in
that <hi>Churches name;</hi> we hold not all this ſufficient cauſe
to warrant our ſeparation from that Church: For all
Churches conſiſt of Men, and all Men are faulty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63040:52"/>
and ſuch as the Men are, ſuch we may expect
their works ſhould be, notwithſtanding the Divine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance:
And to ſeparare from all faulty Churches and
Worſhip, is to ſeparate from all the World; and allow
all the World to ſeparate from us.</p>
                  <p>XXI. If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> true Church deny us Communion, unleſs
we will commit ſome ſin, or omit ſome neceſſary duty;
though we cannot be <hi>locally preſent</hi> in ſuch caſes, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
what they ſo do, yet we ſhall not therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them <hi>as no Churches;</hi> but lamenting their ſin,
and their denying us their Communion on juſt Terms,
we ſhall continue the Union and Communion of <hi>Faith
and Love,</hi> and be <hi>preſent in ſpirit,</hi> though <hi>corporally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi>
deſiring a part in their Prayers, and owning all
that God diſowneth not.</p>
                  <p>XXII. We hold that no Chriſtians muſt be disjoyned,
or ſeparated in any of the ſeven Points of Union requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Eph. 4. 3, 4, 5, 6. 1. One Body,</hi>
(the Catholick Church headed by Chriſt:) 2. <hi>One Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
(the Holy Ghoſt:) 3. <hi>One Hope of our Calling, (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
Adoption,</hi> and the Heavenly Glory:) 4. <hi>One
Lord</hi> (Jeſus Chriſt:) 5. <hi>One Faith,</hi> (the Eſſentials of
Chriſtianity believed:) 6. <hi>One Baptiſme,</hi> (or Baptiſmal
Covenant with God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt:)
7. <hi>One God</hi> and Father of all, <hi>who is above all, and through
all, and in us all;</hi> of whom, and to whom, and through
whom are all things.</p>
                  <p>XXIII. Though we are not ſatisfied of the lawfulneſs
of uſing the tranſient Image of the Croſs, as a <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Sign</hi> and <hi>Symbol</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſo much Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
(much leſs to refuſe from Baptiſm and Chriſtendom
all Chriſtians Infants, unleſs they will have them ſo croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
no more than if a Crucifix were ſo impoſed and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63040:53"/>
uſed:) yet do we not condemn <hi>all uſe</hi> of either Croſs, or
Crucifix: Nor do we preſume cenſoriouſly to reproach
and diſhonour the ancient Chriſtians, who, living among
Pagans that derided Chriſt Crucified, did ſhew them, by
oft uſing this ſign, that they were not aſhamed of the
Croſs: And though we find that they uſed more Rites
and ſignificant deviſed Signs and Ceremonies, than we
think they ſhould have done, yet we judge it our Duty
to love and honour their Memorial: Nor do we take all
Rites to be ſinful that are ſignificant.</p>
                  <p>XXIV. We hold not all the uſe of Images, even the
Images of holy Perſons, to be unlawful: Hiſtorical and
memorative uſe we commonly allow, as the <hi>Engliſh Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>
Bible ſheweth by many Pictures: We condemn not
them that have Scripture Perſons and Hiſtory Painted on
their Walls, or on the very Bricks that adorn their Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
nor that uſe a Skelleton or Deaths-head; or that
by theſe are minded of Mortality or the Life to come, and
ſo make a <hi>holy uſe</hi> of them, (as good Men ſhould do of
all lawful things; which therefore are <hi>pure and ſanctified</hi>
to them.)</p>
                  <p>XXV. We hold not a Gown, or other meer diſtinctive
Garment for Miniſters, to be unlawful, in which, ſaith
the Canon, <hi>no holineſs is placed;</hi> any more than to
Judges, Lawyers, or Phyloſophers. And ſome of us
hold a Surplice rather to be uſed, than the Miniſtry for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken:
And thoſe that think otherwiſe, think not the
matter of ſo much weight, as to alienate them from Love
or Communion with thoſe that uſe it: For we pretend
not to ſo much perfection, as to be all juſt of a mind and
meaſure of Knowledge in all things, of no greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
than this: Nor would we ſilence faithful Miniſters
for a Surplice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:63040:53"/>
XXVI. Though we greatly diſlike the common uſe of
<hi>God-Fathers,</hi> as they undertake that, as <hi>Sole-promiſers</hi> for
the Child, which they never ſignifie credibly the leaſt
purpoſe to perform, and the Parents are excluded from
entering their own Children into Covenant with God,
and muſt not ſpeak one covenanting or promiſing word;
no, nor be urged to be preſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet we refuſe not
the uſe of ſuch <hi>Sureties</hi> or <hi>Sponſors</hi> in Baptiſme, as are
but <hi>Seconds</hi> to the Parents and only atteſt the Parents
credibility, and undertake to take care of the Childrens
Education, in caſe the Parents either <hi>apoſtatize</hi> or <hi>dye;</hi>
nor yet ſuch as are <hi>Adopters</hi> of the Children, and take
them to them as their own, and ſo have the right of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of them, and covenanting in their names and ſtead.
Though yet we conform not to the denying of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to the Children of all godly Parents, that either can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get ſuch God-Fathers, or will not, but offer to enter
their own Children into that Covenant.</p>
                  <p>XXVII. Many of us hold it lawful to communicate
Kneeling, in the reception of the Sacramental Body and
Blood of Chriſt: And thoſe of us that think ſo, and
thoſe of us that think otherwiſe, take it not for ſuch a
matter as ſhould hinder Chriſtian Love, Concord, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Peace; or allow Men to deſpiſe, condemn, or
excommunicate one another: But all deteſt that cruelty
that dare caſt out the worthy Members of Chriſt and his
Church from Communion, for their difference in that
geſture.</p>
                  <p>XXVIII. We all hold that God muſt be orderly and
decently worſhipped with the Body, as well as ſpiritually
with the Mind: And that reverent geſtures and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
are fit, not only to <hi>expreſs mental reverence</hi> to God,
but alſo to <hi>excite it</hi> in our ſelves and others. And that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63040:54"/>
ſuch ſlovenly, rude, and undecent behaviour, as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to ſignifie <hi>prophaneneſs and contempt,</hi> or to tempt
others thereto, is no ſmall ſin, whatever men intend
by it.</p>
                  <p>XXIX. We all hold that <hi>Preaching, Prayer,</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi>
ſhould not be made <hi>ridiculous</hi> or <hi>contemptible,</hi>
by the Miniſters incongruous, light, or otherwiſe unmeet
and uncomly words; nor by tautologies, and ſuch an
unmeet ſtile as tendeth to diſaffect the Hearers: (Though
that Curioſity, which conſiſteth in pedantick, light, and
frothy Speech, unſuitable to the Hearers edification, we
diſlike.) And O that God would raiſe up enow ſuch for
his Service, in the Church and World, as are able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
true wiſdom, holineſs, and zeal, in words beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the moſt Holy Majeſty, and the holy Things of which
they ſpeak. But yet we judge that various Auditories
ſhould have various Stiles, though none but clear, and
ſpiritual, and ſerious: As a labouring poor man will
chuſe a great piece of Brown Bread, before a little piece
of Manchet, when idle tender Perſons will chuſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>XXX. We are ſo far from holding it unlawful to uſe
the Creed, and Commandments, and Lords Prayer, as
ſome accuſe us, that we take them to be the Summaries
of the Chriſtian Religion, as to matter of <hi>Belief, Deſire,</hi>
and <hi>Worſhip;</hi> which the Church ſhould uſe and profeſs
accordingly, and ſhould never be forgtoten.</p>
                  <p>XXXI. We are ſo far from being againſt Catechizing,
as ſome have accuſed us, as that we take it to be a moſt
needful thing, and no ſmall part of that work which
both Miniſters and Parents ſhould perform.</p>
                  <p>XXXII. We are far from oppoſing that ſort of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
which conſiſteth in the ſolemn tranſition of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63040:54"/>
Perſons out of the ſtate of Infant Communion into that
of the Adult, by their ſolemn intelligent owning that
Covenant with God, which they entred into by others
in their Infancy. The Reaſons of which more than one
of us have long ago publickly given to the World, (Mr.
<hi>Hanmer,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter.)</hi> And the want of which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
is a great cauſe of the pollution of the Church, and
of the increaſe of Anabaptiſts, who are ſcandalized at
the omiſſion of it, and the turning it into a Ceremony or
Formality.</p>
                  <p>XXXIII. We hold it a Duty for all Miniſters in their
Adminiſtrations of Baptiſm, the Lords Supper, Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in their Speeches of the dead at Burials, to go
as far in <hi>charitable hopeful expreſſions, as Reaſon will allow;</hi>
and to ſpeak and judge of men according to their own
<hi>intelligent Profeſſions,</hi> not rendred incredible by proved
contrary Expreſſions, or notorious contrariety of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
as being no ſearchers of mens hearts our ſelves:
And where Diſcipline is truly exerciſed, ſuch words are
meet, as otherwiſe are not tolerable. So that if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
not to the Liturgy in our Adminiſtration of any of
theſe Ordinances of Chriſt, and if we dare not pronounce
of all the open Atheiſts, Infidels, Hereticks, Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
Rebels, Perjured, Murderers, Thieves, Adulterers,
Drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who made not away themſelves, and
were not unbaptized or excommunicate, that <hi>[God of
his great mercy hath taken to himſelf the Souls of theſe
dear Brethren,]</hi> nor give thanks for <hi>[delivering them
out of the miſeries of this ſinful World,]</hi> nor pray to reſt
in Chriſt <hi>[<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is our hope is this our Brother doth,] &amp;c.</hi> it is
not becauſe we deny any of this before granted, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we dare not renounce the Goſpel, that ſaith, <hi>[He
that believeth not ſhall be damned,]</hi> and <hi>[without holineſs
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63040:55"/>
none ſhall ſee God,]</hi> and <hi>[Except ye repent ye ſhall all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;]</hi>
and becauſe we are loath to preach to men all our
lives, that which we ſhall contradict at mens burial, and
tempt the ungodly to preſumption and damnation.</p>
                  <p>XXXIV. Many of us hold it lawful to keep Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Days of Thankſgiving, in commemoration of the
great Mercies of God to his Church, by the Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Labour, Miracles, Lives, and Sufferings of the
Apoſtles, and moſt famous promoters of the Faith; ſo
that Superſtition and prohibited Creature-worſhip be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
avoided. And thoſe of us that ſcruple ſuch
Days of mans Inſtitution, yet take not this for any other
than a tolerable difference among us.</p>
                  <p>XXXV. We are not againſt ſuch ſort of reading the
ſound parts of the Apocrypha, as we may do by other
good Books, ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed from other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and uſed in due time and place; though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
not ſo far as to declare our Aſſent and Conſent to
the <hi>uſe of the Calendar, Preſcript,</hi> or <hi>Directory,</hi> which
requireth them to be read in the Mornings, from <hi>Septemb.
27.</hi> and 28. till <hi>Novemb. 24.</hi> even <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,
Suſanna, Tobit,</hi> when as the Vulgar underſtand not the
word <hi>Apocrypha</hi> ſufficiently, to diſtinguiſh them from the
ſacred Scriptures, when they are equally called the <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
and read in the ſame order. And we are confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this part of our Non-conformity by the Articles of
Religion, which diſcard the Apocrypha, and by the
Learned Treatiſe of the late Biſhop <hi>Couſins,</hi> who hath
fully proved that the ancient Churches received not thoſe
Books into the Canon, and by many Doctors of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> that charge them with Untruths:
Some of us have ſeen the Writing (as on good reaſon is
ſuppoſed) of a preſent Learned worthy Biſhop, who
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63040:55"/>
ſheweth that the words of the Angel in <hi>Tobit</hi> are a Lye,
who ſaid that <hi>[he was the Son of</hi> Ananie <hi>of the Tribe of</hi>
Naphtali:] And that ſo is his ſaying, <hi>[that the ſmoke of
a Fiſhes heart will drive away all Devils, that they ſhall
never return; when Chriſt tells us of ſome that go not out
but by Prayer and Faſting.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>XXXVI. We are far from deſigning any abaſement of
the Clergy, nor do we deny, or draw others to deny, any
due Reverence and Obedience to them. And though we
know that the <hi>bare Title and Office</hi> will never preſerve
ſufficient reſpect, for the honour of the Clergy, and the
ſucceſs of their work, without competent qualifications
and labours of the perſons; yet would we rather hide
than open or reproach the faults of ſuch as are tolerable
in that ſacred Office, and would do our beſt for their
work ſake, to promote the eſteem even of thoſe that
differ from us, and of ſome that perſecute us. We know
that the People are exhorted, <hi>to know thoſe that labour
among them, and are over them in the Lord, and to eſteem
them highly in love, for their work ſake,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 12,
13. <hi>And to obey them that have the Rule</hi> (or <hi>Guidance) of
them, and to ſubmit themſelves,</hi> Heb. 13. 17. 24. <hi>And
that the Elders that Rule well are worthy of double honour,
eſpecially they that labour in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim.
5. 17. We that take it for our Duty to <hi>honour all men,</hi>
and <hi>ſubmit our ſelves to one another,</hi> would not deny
any <hi>due honour</hi> to any of the <hi>Clergie</hi> that have any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence,
either in age, grace, gifts, or by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
appointment, as his Officers (as aforeſaid,) or any
way given them by Chriſt: We take it not for a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be from under Government.</p>
                  <p>XXXVII. Our Non-conformity conſiſteth not in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
a <hi>National, Provincial,</hi> or other <hi>Church Form</hi> of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63040:56"/>
                     <hi>mans invention and inſtitution:</hi> On theſe Suppoſitions:</p>
                  <p>1. So it be preſuppoſed that there is ſomewhat of <hi>Divine
Inſtitution</hi> predetermined by Chriſt and his Spirit in the
Apoſtles, (that is, 1. That there be ſuch <hi>Doctrine, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> as he hath commanded: 2. That
there be ſuch Paſtors to exerciſe them, whoſe Office he
hath deſcribed: 3. That there be ſuch ſtated Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Societies in which they ſhall be uſed, even <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Chriſtians aſſociated for Perſonal Communion therein.</hi>
4. That all theſe Churches enjoy the Priviledges granted
them by Chriſt, and live in love, peace, and concord, and
hold ſuch juſt correſpondence as is neceſſary thereto, and
to the Common End and Good: All this is of Divine
appointment.)</p>
                  <p>2. So that theſe <hi>Divine Inſtitutions</hi> be not violated by
<hi>Humane,</hi> or by the power of man.</p>
                  <p>3. So that <hi>Humane Churches</hi> be not made <hi>equal and
co-ordinate</hi> to the Divine, much leſs <hi>ſuperior,</hi> and <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate;</hi>
as if they were to Chriſts inſtituted Churches,
what a <hi>Kingdom</hi> is to a <hi>City,</hi> or a <hi>Regiment</hi> to a <hi>Troop,</hi> and
Chriſts Churches were but <hi>ſimilar parts</hi> of the <hi>Humane
Churches,</hi> that muſt rule them. But as the King is <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopus
exterior,</hi> or the Governour of the Churches ſo far
as the Sword is to be uſed; ſo, <hi>circa ſacra,</hi> we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaid, that he may make his own Officers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
Provinces for them, and Orders of their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe:
And the Churches in his Dominions may be ſo
called <hi>one National Church,</hi> as he is the exterior Civil
Governour of them all by the Sword, which indeed is
but to be a Religious or Chriſtian Kingdom; as alſo, <hi>ab
accidente,</hi> as theſe many Churches are under one Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
(yea were he an Infidel) King; and as hereby they
have the advantage of fraternal aſſociation and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63040:56"/>
for concord. But proper Denominations are
from the Eſſential Form.</p>
                  <p>XXXVIII. It is no part of our Non-conformity to be
againſt the due Uſe or Authority of Councils, or Synods
of the Clergy. We hold, that when one is caſt out of
<hi>one</hi> Church for a cauſe belonging to the <hi>Cogniſance of
many, many</hi> may have occaſion to take Cogniſance of it:
And the edification of each other, the ſatisfactory Debate
of Difficulties, the preſervation of mutual Love, Peace,
and Concord, may make Synods to be uſeful. But yet
we hold that the major Vote of Biſhops in a Council are
not thereby the <hi>proper Governours</hi> of the <hi>minor diſſenting
part,</hi> nor of the <hi>abſent Biſhops;</hi> but that Councils are for
<hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi> and not for <hi>direct Regiment of each
other,</hi> (though <hi>together</hi> and <hi>aſunder</hi> the <hi>Paſtors</hi> are all
<hi>Governours of the Flock.)</hi> And ſome of us have long ago
publickly proved, that Councils were called <hi>General</hi> at
firſt, but with reſpect to the Dominions or Empire of
one Prince, and not as if they were <hi>Univerſal</hi> as to all the
<hi>Chriſtian World;</hi> and that <hi>abſolutely Univerſal Councils</hi>
never <hi>were,</hi> or <hi>ought,</hi> or <hi>can,</hi> or ever <hi>will</hi> be called; and
that to pretend that a <hi>Papal</hi> or <hi>Imperial</hi> General Council
is the Univerſal Law-giver of the World, and that they
have a promiſe of Infallibility in what ever they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and that we receive our Faith in Chriſt upon their
Infallibility given by him, (and ſo we muſt know that
Chriſt maketh them Infallible before we can believe that
he is Chriſt.) Theſe and ſuch other nonſenſe cheats
which ſome are now agitating, are fit to delude none
but the groſly ignorant, that are prepared for deceit.</p>
                  <p>XXXIX. Yet we deny not, but that God having firſt
bound us to <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> as far as we can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ttain,
(with loving forbearance in the reſt,) when a lawful Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63040:57"/>
or Council hath determined of a way of Concord, on
lawful Terms, in matters under their Power, there is an
Obligation on all the particular Members, to forbear
breaking that Union, and violating thoſe lawful Terms
of Concord: For where there is not a <hi>Governing Law,</hi>
there may be an <hi>Obliging Contract,</hi> or <hi>Conſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas even the Papiſts now uſually teach that
even a Councils Decrees bind not the Churches, at leaſt
thoſe that had no Delegates, till by actual reception they
conſent, be it known to the World, that on theſe Terms
the Non-conformiſts in <hi>London</hi> ſeem to have ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
if it had been only <hi>Indifferent things</hi> that the late
Convocation had impoſed on them: For when the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
met to chuſe Clarks for the Convocation for <hi>London,</hi>
(at <hi>Sion-Colledge,)</hi> the major Vote choſe Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> (whom the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> according to
his Power, did reject;) ſo that the City of <hi>London</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath, nor ever had one Clark of their own chuſing in
this Convocation which altered the Liturgy; but the
Dignitaries, and the two Clarks choſen by the exterior
parts of the Country, were the only Perſons hence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
(that ever we heard of, or could learn:) And
ſurely our after-conſent will hardly be alledged. And
<hi>London</hi> is no inconſiderable part of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>XL. We refuſe not the Renunciation of the ſolemn
Vow and Covenant, as if we thought it bound us unto
any diſloyalty, Sedition, or other ſin: For we are ready
to profeſs, that it ſo obligeth no Man: It cannot make a
Sin to be a Duty or no Sin, nor a Duty to our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
to be no Duty; nor diſoblige us from any part of
our due Obedience to the King. Nay, we judge that
we muſt not make our ſelves a Religion or Law by our
own Vows, or bind our ſelves to any thing but what we
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63040:57"/>
are bound to antecedently by God; and ſo our Vows
muſt be but ſecondary Obligations: And theſe being our
own thoughts, we muſt needs hold accordingly, that
this ſolemn Vow doth <hi>bind as</hi> to nothing, but what God
doth bind us to antecedently himſelf; and what would
be our Duty had we never taken it: And therefore
ſhould we renounce this Vow, we ſhould ſtill take our
ſelves bound by God himſelf to do all the good that in it
was Vowed. Whether the Vow of a thing indifferent
bind or not, we are not determining; but as we hold
that no ſuch thing ſhould be Vowed, ſo we declare that
it is none of our preſent caſe, as is aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>XLI. We are ſo far from refuſing the <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath, or
the Subſcription, upon any diſloyal or rebellious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
that we ſhall hereafter adjoin ſuch a Profeſſion of
this Subject, as ſhall ſuffice with all Men of common hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
and impartiality, to juſtifie our Principles of
Loyalty, againſt Malice it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And if yet Malice will go on to keep open our Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and keep us under Odium and unjuſt Suſpenſions,
and provoke men to forbid us to preach Chriſt's Goſpel,
by talking of the <hi>late Wars,</hi> and charging all on the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi>
we ſhall now only crave their juſt Anſwer
to theſe few Queſtions following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 1.</hi> Are they willing that <hi>ſo many</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh
Non-conformiſts</hi> ſhall have leave to preach Chriſt's Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
freely, as never had any hand in the Wars? If they
will procure us this, we are confident that the reſt that
medled with the Wars are ſo few, and ſo ſelf-denying,
that they will thankfully accept of this liberty for their
Brethren, though they be ſilenced, or baniſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:63040:58"/>
                     <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Was it for matter of War that near two Thouſand
Miniſters were ejected, or ſilenced, 1662? or for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe? Was this the cauſe that Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> of
<hi>Weeden,</hi> that loſt an Arm in the King's Army and War,
could not have a day abated him in the Common Goal at
<hi>Warwick,</hi> when he preached as a Non-conformiſt? And
many other Inſtances we may give.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Did ever any of us that now addreſs our ſelves
to you, go farther in our Principles than Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi>
did, even in his excellent Book of <hi>Chriſtian ſubjection?</hi>
we deteſted all that went beyond him in his Doctrine of
Reſiſtance: Or did any of us ever go near ſo far as your
famous <hi>R. Hooker</hi> in his <hi>firſt</hi> and his <hi>eighth</hi> Book of <hi>Eccleſ.
Politie,</hi> (publiſhed long ago, and again by Biſhop <hi>Gauden,</hi>
and Dedicated to the King,) whoſe over Popular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
one of us, long ago, at large confuted: And were
<hi>they ſilenced</hi> for this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 4.</hi> We humbly crave them that remember, and
knew the Perſons, to bethink them, whether, 1. Moſt of
of the Parliament, when the War began: 2. Moſt of the
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Aſſembly, when they met: 3. Moſt of the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Collonels, and chief Officers: 4. Moſt of
the Lord Lieutenants of the Militia: 5. Moſt of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
Major Generals, in the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s time:
6. Moſt of the Sea Captains, in the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s
time: We ſay, Whether moſt of theſe (we think ten to
one, and in ſome Inſtances twenty to one) were not
Conformiſts? As ſure as Archbiſhop <hi>Abbots</hi> was, and all the
Biſhops, ſave ſix, in his days; on whom Doctor <hi>Heyling</hi>
layeth the cauſe of our Diviſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:63040:58"/>
                     <hi>Q. 5.</hi> And is it juſt, that all the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made odious, and all the Conformable Miniſters ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced
for theſe Conformiſts ſakes, even ſuch as never
had a hand in the buſineſs?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 6.</hi> If the War had been raiſed only by Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
yet why ſhould a thouſand or 1400 Miniſters <hi>now,</hi>
that were never proved guilty of any Wars, be ſilenced
and ruined for other mens Actions; any more than the
Conformiſts for the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi>'s, who was a
Commander for the Parliament?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Why ſhould <hi>no other penalty</hi> ſerve in this caſe,
but <hi>ſilencing us?</hi> to the loſs or hazard of the innocent
people. Is ſilencing us <hi>our ſuffering</hi> moſt, or the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples?</hi>
If half the Bakers, Brewers, and Country Farmers
had been in thoſe Wars, is there no way to puniſh them,
but to put down their Trade, and forbidding them to
bring Proviſion to the Markets? Would not puniſhing
the innocent, as Drunkards or Whoremongers are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſatisfie you? Nor any thing but keeping them
from <hi>preaching the Doctrine of Salvation?</hi> And that
when the Fire conſumed the Churches, and when in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Pariſhes the tenth part of the People have no Church
to go to?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Do you think that the Devil and the Papiſts
had rather we were ſilenced, or not? Are they pleaſed
with well-doing, and with that which promoteth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
intereſt, and mans ſalvation? And hath the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion been ſecured and advantaged by our
uſage?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:63040:59"/>
                     <hi>Q. 9.</hi> If it be that we <hi>Preach worſe</hi> than others, or
<hi>Preach Sedition,</hi> or unſound Doctrine, why are not we
<hi>accuſed of it,</hi> and judged upon proof? And why are we
not ſuffered rather to <hi>Preach publickly,</hi> where witneſs may
be had, than driven into <hi>corners,</hi> where Sedition or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
may be hid by thoſe that Preach it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 10.</hi> If you ſay that <hi>our preaching is needleſs,</hi> Is not
<hi>your own then as needleſs,</hi> if you preach the <hi>ſame Goſpel?</hi>
And muſt you have Lordſhips, great maintenance, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
honour, and obedience, for <hi>needleſs preaching?</hi>
And when ſome Pariſhes have ten thouſand, ſome twenty
thouſand, ſome thirty thouſand, ſome it is thought four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
thouſand Souls, when three thouſand cannot come
to hear in the Church, why is Preaching any more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to thoſe <hi>three thouſand</hi> than to <hi>all the reſt?</hi> or to <hi>four
perſons</hi> in a <hi>Village,</hi> than to <hi>thouſands</hi> in <hi>Cities?</hi> When
our Preaching and other Miniſtration <hi>ceaſeth</hi> to be <hi>noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
needful,</hi> we profeſs our ſelves joyfully willing to
ceaſe: Our <hi>Fleſh</hi> had rather have eaſe, and a gainfuller
Trade of life, than ſpending-labour, with poverty, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
ſcorn, and impriſonments.</p>
                  <p>XLII. To conclude, As far as we are able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the moſt learned, ſober, judicious Conformiſts, by
their own words to us, and their Writings, they differ not
at all from us about the <hi>matter it ſelf,</hi> which we deny
Conformity to, but confeſs it to be unlawful, (as to the
hardeſt points of the impoſed Subſcriptions, Oaths, and
Declarations, and Covenants;) but they only take the
words in ſuch a ſenſe, in which we our ſelves could take
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63040:59"/>
them, were we perſwaded that it were indeed the true
meaning of them. And do they that are as much as we
againſt that ſenſe which we diſown, and agree with us
in the matter, deſerve liberty, honour, and preferment,
for otherwiſe interpreting the words of the Law, which the
Law-givers themſelves will not interpret? And doth our
ſuppoſition that the Law-makers mean properly as they
ſpeak, deſerve ſcorn, ſilencing, and Goals, from them that
will not expound them to us? The righteous God will be
Judge between us.</p>
                  <p>For inſtance, 1. By <hi>[Aſſent]</hi> in the Declaration requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
we underſtand <hi>[Believing it to be true.]</hi> But the
Conformiſts that we ſpeak of, underſtand only <hi>[a Belief
that I may uſe it.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>By</hi> [all and every thing contained in the Book] <hi>we
ſuppoſe is meant</hi> [all and every thing indeed:] <hi>But they
ſay, only</hi> the Forms to be uſed are meant, <hi>and many
other things in the Book not meant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We find after named <hi>[Unfeigned Aſſent and Conſent
unto, and Approbation of the ſaid Book, and to the uſe
of all the Prayers, Rites, and Ceremonies, Forms and
Orders therein contained and preſcribed,]</hi> we think here
<hi>Approbation and Aſſent</hi> are more than <hi>Conſent to uſe;</hi> and
we think that the <hi>uſe of all the Orders</hi> is more than
the <hi>uſe of the Forms:</hi> We think that <hi>no Word</hi> in the
Book was intended to be <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> and that the <hi>Doctrines,
Calendars,</hi> (even that <hi>untrue</hi> one to find out <hi>Eaſter-day)
Rubricks,</hi> and <hi>Directories,</hi> have each their proper
uſe. We ſuppoſe that the foregoing words of <hi>the Uſe,</hi>
are <hi>the End,</hi> and the Form of the Declaration is the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63040:60"/>
                     <hi>Means</hi> to ſecure that <hi>Uſe as the End,</hi> and that the <hi>Means</hi>
hath more in than the <hi>End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Some of them ſuppoſe, that denying Chriſtendom
to Chriſtians Children, for want of Croſſing, or Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and denying Communion to true Chriſtians that
receive not kneeling, are none of the <hi>Orders to be uſed:</hi>
But we think otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>4. Some of them think, that <hi>[Admitting none to the
holy Communion, till they be Confirmed, or deſirous to be
Confirmed,]</hi> though it be the <hi>very words,</hi> is none of
the <hi>Orders</hi> which they Conſent to uſe; (and we never
knew any uſe it by any tryal of mens deſires:) But we
think that nothing in the Book is intelligible, if ſuch
plain paſſages are not.</p>
                  <p>5. Some of them by the words at Burial <hi>[that thank
God for taking to himſelf the Soul of this our dear Brother,
out of the miſeries, &amp;c.)</hi> underſtand not his <hi>Salvation,</hi>
but his going out of this World: But we think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>6. When only <hi>[the unbaptized, ſelf murderers, and
excommunicate]</hi> are there excepted, ſome ſay, all others
are meant that <hi>ought to be excommunicate;</hi> and ſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Prieſt is made the Judge who <hi>ſhould be Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate:</hi>
But we think, that <hi>Exceptio particularis firmat
regulam in non exceptis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. They think that the Words in the Canon <hi>[that
Nothing in the three Books is contrary to the Word of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63040:60"/>
God,]</hi> are meant with exceptions as to <hi>[Nothing]</hi> or to
<hi>[Contrariety:]</hi> But we take <hi>[Nothing]</hi> for <hi>[Nothing,]</hi> and
<hi>[Contrary]</hi> for <hi>[Contrary.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. Some of them ſay, that the <hi>Church</hi> being the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of theſe Impoſitions, we are to take them in the
<hi>Churches ſenſe,</hi> which the Biſhops may ſignifie. But
we think, that we muſt take them in the ſenſe of the
King and Parliament, as the Law-makers; and that no
Church or Biſhops can alter our Religion, or Articles, or
Subſcriptions, by an Expoſitory Power.</p>
                  <p>9. Some of them think, that the words <hi>[on any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe
whatſoever]</hi> in the Subſcription, have <hi>exceptions:</hi>
But we know not how any words can be more exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
of exceptions.</p>
                  <p>10. Some of them think, that <hi>[by any Commiſſioned]</hi>
is meant only <hi>[Lawfully Commiſſioned,]</hi> and ſo Subjects
are left to judge of the <hi>Lawfulneſs:</hi> We find there no
ſuch Limitation or Expoſition.</p>
                  <p>11. Some of them ſay, that by <hi>[the Government of
the Church,</hi> not to be <hi>altered]</hi> is not meant the <hi>Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
uſe of the Keys:</hi> But we think, that <hi>their actual
Government</hi> is the <hi>Government actually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. Some of them ſay, that by <hi>[no change or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion]</hi>
is meant only of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of Epiſcopacy: We
take <hi>[no alteration]</hi> for <hi>[no alteration.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. Some of them ſay, that by <hi>[not endeavouring]</hi>
is meant only [not <hi>ſeditiouſly,</hi> or by ill means:] We
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63040:61"/>
think, That <hi>ubi DEX non diſtinguit, non eſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guendum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. Some of them think that no <hi>Law or words impoſed</hi>
muſt be expounded contrary to <hi>Gods Law,</hi> or any <hi>former
Law,</hi> or to the <hi>King's or Peoples rights.</hi> But, 1. That is
to ſuppoſe that men cannot contradict themſelves or
God, or do unjuſtly. 2. And then whatever Oaths men
put on us we may take them, were the words never ſo
falſe or impious, becauſe the meaning muſt ſtill be
judged good.</p>
                  <p>15. Some ſay that we muſt put the beſt ſenſe on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Oaths, and Covenants, and Subſcriptions, that the
words can be ſubdued to: We think that they muſt be
taken in the ſenſe of the Law-makers, which is to be
judged of by the uſual meaning of their words, unleſs
themſelves do otherwiſe expound them.</p>
                  <p>And ſo in many other Inſtances, the Conformiſts ſay
that they would not Conform themſelves, if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the words as we do.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that all theſe worthy Conformiſts before
mentioned do confeſs, that if the words of the Laws be
properly to be underſtood, and not with their limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
then the Conformiſts are in the wrong, and the
Non-conformiſts in the right; we conclude with theſe
few Queſtions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 1.</hi> Whether we owe not that honour to our Law-makers,
as to ſuppoſe that they are able, and willing, to
ſpeak intelligibly?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:63040:61"/>
                     <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Whether they would have men left as to the
Oath of Allegiance, and all other Oaths and Laws, to
ſubdue the Law-makers words to any ſenſe that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
thinks lawful; and to make themſelves Judges of
the ſenſe, by departing from the common uſe of the
words, without proof that the Law-makers meant other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Whether there be need of much Learning,
Conſcience, or Honeſty, to ſtretch the words from
their ordinary ſenſe, more than to do otherwiſe? And
whether ſo to do would deſerve honour and preferment,
and to do otherwiſe be a Crime that deſerveth ſilencing,
and ruine?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Whether their way of Expoſition, or ours, tend
more to promote Perjury and Equivocation; and which
more ſecureth Truth and Honeſty?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 5.</hi> If once the Conſcience of Oaths and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
be relaxed, by ſtretching words to the takers inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
are not the Lives of Princes left in danger, and the
Bonds of common Converſe looſened?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 6.</hi> If this muſt be the cauſe of our ſufferings, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
is it not juſtice ſo to tell the World, and write it on
our Croſs, that we are ſilenced and laid in Goals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we dare not take Oaths and Covenants, impoſed
in Terms excluding limitations and exceptions, in a
limited excepting ſenſe, without the Explication of the
Law-makers?</p>

                     <hi>Q. 7.</hi> And if we muſt be ſo uſed, whether any in the
whole World be more unfit to ſilence, impriſon, fine,
reproach, and ruine us, for miſ-underſtanding the words
which we are to Subſcribe or Promiſe or Covenant in,
<hi>(viz.</hi> for taking <hi>[none]</hi> to mean <hi>[none,]</hi> [no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing]
to mean <hi>[nothing,] [not any]</hi> to mean <hi>[not
any,] contrary]</hi> to mean <hi>[contrary,] [all]</hi> to mean
<hi>[all,]</hi> than thoſe that while they are ſet to ruine us,
will by no intreaties, after our almoſt fourteen Years ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
and expectations, be prevailed with to procure
us an Expoſition of the ſenſe of any of theſe ſo much
controverted words? We are more confident that the
Law-makers can more certainly, and infallibly expound
their own words, than the Pope or Council can expound
Theological difficulties: And if our Accuſers will not
once endeavour to procure them ſo to do, nor be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to conſent it, when Conformiſts and Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
are chiefly diſagreed about the Interpretation of
them; and when our preaching or ſilence, honour or
reproach, maintenance or poverty, liberty or impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yea, and much <hi>duty or ſin</hi> in the Body of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
lyeth upon the reſolution of this Controverſie,
(what is the Law-makers meaning,) we will ſtill refer
all to him that judgeth righteouſly, who will ſhortly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
end the Controverſie; praying to God, though
Men will not hear us, <hi>to open our Lips, that our Mouths

and that theſe evils which the craft and ſubtilty of the
Devil or Man worketh againſt us be brought to nought,
and by the providence of his goodneſs they may be diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that we his Servants being hurt by no perſecution,
may evermore give him thanks in his holy Church;
that in all our troubles we may put our whole truſt and
confidence in his mercy, and evermore ſerve him in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and pureneſs of living; that he will forgive our
Enemies, Perſecutors, and Slanderers, and turn their
hearts; eſpecially that he will ſave our Poſterity from
their Curſe, who ſay, The Blood be on us, and on our
Children. For we are not againſt ſuch a Liturgy as this.</p>
