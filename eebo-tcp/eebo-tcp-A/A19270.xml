            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat wee doe not come negligently to the Lordes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wherevnto we nowe prepare our ſelues, let vs call theſe thinges fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. This Sacrament vſed according to the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, conſiſteth of two parts, that is, the outwarde ſignes, which are Bread and Wine: and the inwarde thing, whiche is the body and bloud of our Sauiour Chriſte, the true foode of our ſoules, which onely nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth vs to eternall life. Now as man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of two partes, body, and ſoule: ſo the body feedeth vpon the outward elements of Breade and Wine, but the ſoule feedeth in deede, and truly, vpon Ieſus Chriſt crucified. The outwarde eating by the inſtrumentes of the bodie, cauſeth all our ſenſes, our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, our ſeeing, our feeling, our taſting, to helpe our inward eating by faith, and by the ſame quickeneth, ſtirreth, ſtrengtheneth, and increaſeth our faith, that we may eate the

bodie and bloud of Chriſte more effectually and fruitefully. For when the faithfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian heareth the wordes of Chriſtes inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſound in his eares.<note place="margin">

               <hi>This is my body that is giuen for you, &amp;c. This is my bloud that is ſhed for the remiſsion of your ſinnes.</hi> It ſtirreth vp his faith (for faith is by hearing) to lay ſtrong holdfaſt vpon this promiſe, and in his heart, doeth aſſure himſelfe, that Chriſte died and ſhed his bloud not onely for the redemption of the whole world generally, but for his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo perticularly, and that he vndoubtedly, is partaker of that bleſſed worke of our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24</note> When we heare theſe wordes. <hi>Doe this in remembraunce of me.</hi> Our faith is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it is Chriſtes commandement, that we ſhould vſe this Sacrament, to cal to our remembrance, the benefit of our ſaluation by the death of Chriſte, and in heart and minde, at all times, but then eſpecially, to ſhewe our ſelues truely thankefull to him, for the ſame. When our ſight beholdeth on the Table, the Breade and Wine by Chriſtes ordinaunce broken, and powred out, for vs to vſe, our faith is moued thus to thinke: as ſurely and truely, as my bodily eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde vpon the table of the Lord, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Breade and Wine, as the outward parte of his Sacrament, and ſee the ſame broken and powred out for me: ſo aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe I with the eye of my faith, beholde the body and bloud of Chriſte broken and
<pb facs="tcp:18827:3"/>
ſhedde for me vpon the altar of the croſſe, and the ſame my ſauiour ſitting now on the right hand of God the father, with the ſame bodie and bloud, now glorified: wherewith vpon the croſſe, he paide the price of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. When we ſee the Miniſter offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to vs the bread and the cup, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſame in our hand, and by our ſenſe feele them inwardly in our heartes, our faith is moued to haue this cogitation. As tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as our Sauiour Chriſte vpon the Croſſe, by his bodie broken and his bloud ſhedde, wrought our redemption, and offered the benefite thereof, to all that would beleeue generally: ſo truely am I aſſured, that now in the vſe of this holy ſacrament by his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, he offereth the ſame to me particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be applied to my ſelfe. And as ſurely as my hande receiueth the outwarde crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: ſo ſurely, by my faith, doe I receiue Chriſte himſelfe, and in my heart feele him, and with my ſpirituall armes imbrace him, as the onely price, and meanes of my ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When we eate of the holy bread, and drinke of the reuerende Cuppe, and by our taſte haue ſenſe of the ſweeteneſſe of them, and feele them paſſe downe into our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke there to reſt, that they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their nature, meanes to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe and ſtrengthen our bodie, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewe it in life, our faith is ſtirred vppe by theſe ſenſes thus to thinke. Euen as
<pb facs="tcp:18827:4"/>
certainely, as my taſte feeleth, the ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Bread and Wine, and thereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth in deede, that their operation, is to nouriſhe and ſtrengthen my body, and to quicken my natural ſpirites, which without ſuch nouriſhment, would periſh: euen ſo the taſte of my faith and ſenſe of my heart, doeth feele the ſweetnes of Chriſt his bodie &amp; bloud broken and ſhedde for mee and all mankinde vpon the croſſe, and perceiueth it thereby to be the only foode of my ſoule, without which, ſhould periſh both ſoule and bodie, eternally. And as certainly as I feele with bodily ſenſe that the bread and wine paſſeth into my ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and there according to their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion feede, ſtrengthen and quicken my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodie and ſpirites: ſo aſſuredly doe I with my inward and ſpiritual ſenſe, perceiue the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, and the whole benefite of his death and paſſion to paſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtomack of my ſoule, and boſome of my heart, there through the ſtrength of a true Chriſtian faith, to be laide vp, wrought, and digeſted, as that onely nouriſhment that ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the life of the ſoule, and preſerueth me, both ſoule and body to eternal life. They that will Chriſtianly &amp; charitably, and in the feare of God, weigh and conſider theſe thinges, I truſt, will not thinke, either that we make light account of the externall ſacrament, or in our doctrine teach a ſingle and ſleight ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eating of Chriſt by faith, as the fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb facs="tcp:18827:4"/>
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Rome do charge vs. And I appeale to the conſciences of all them that folow their doctrine, whether euer they were taught to take ſuch ſweete inſtruction and comfort, in the vſe of that bleſſed ſacrament, or no? Theſe good fruites of that ſacrament are much furthered and increaſed by ſundrie other godly cogitations, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach true Chriſtians to vſe in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 24, 25, 26.</note> The word of God teacheth that the vſe of the externall Sacraments, is a maner of confeſſion, wherby men acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them ſelues before God and the world, that they are Chriſtians. Therfore the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full receiuer, when he commeth to the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thinketh this with himſelfe: I by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to this place, proteſt before God and his Angels, and before all the creatures of heauen and earth, that in my heart, I deteſt the religion of Iewes, Turks, Infidels, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, and all other that denie ſaluation to come by the death of Chriſt, &amp; I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelfe vnfaignedly, to be of the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them, that hope to haue the fauour of God, and to be ſaued by the mercie and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt onely.

<pb facs="tcp:18827:5"/>
to vs, that is, that his bodie was broken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe for our redemption, &amp; his bloud ſhed for the remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſinnes. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach,<note place="margin">

The word of God teacheth that the ſacrament of the Lordes ſupper is a linke of vnitie, that knitteth vs together, as members of one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall bodie, and therefore that we ought to be ioyned in mutuall loue, &amp; charitie among our ſelues, and that it is a foule reproch both to Chriſt our head, and to the whole bodie, if we hate, hurte, or hinder one another. For by the vſe thereof, we confeſſe that we are all members of one bodie, all ſeruants of one Maiſter, all children of one Father, all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes vnder one Lord and king, &amp; all parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of one redemption, all heires of one he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, and gift of eternall life. And in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny linkes of vnitie, to be at diſcorde among our ſelues, is in Gods iudgement, an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie teſtimonie againſt vs, in the day of his wrath.<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:18827:5"/>
and preſerued to eternall life. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we ought to be very careful, ſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelues, that we may be worthie gueſts for that bleſſed table. Wherefore I thinke it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, in a word or two, to teache you, howe Chriſtians ſhould prepare themſelues, as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy gueſtes, to come to the Lordes Supper. And how that may be done, S. Paul in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wordes, briefely ſheweth.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.</note> 
               <hi>Let euerie man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>proue himſelfe, and ſo let him eate of this Bread, and drinke of this Cup.</hi> The meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to come worthily to it, is to proue, and trie our ſelues, whether thoſe thinges be in vs, which the worthie gueſtes of that table, ſhould haue. Firſt therefore, we muſt looke vnfaigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into our ſelues, whether we haue an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, or deſire to eate of that bleſſed foode, for a loathing ſtomach, neuer perfectly digeſteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meate that it receiueth, but turneth it to the hurt of the bodie. This appetite or deſire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in vs, vnleſſe it be wrought by the ſharpe ſauce of ſeuere repentance for our ſinnes, which we ſhall the better prepare, if we examine our ſelues by the perfect rule of Gods iuſtice in his lawe, and conſider how farre we are from the ſame, &amp; what daunger hangeth ouer our heads for the want thereof. God ſaith in his lawe:<note place="margin">

               <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God, with al thy hart, with all thy ſoule, with all thy minde, with all thy ſtrength, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe</hi>: that is, we ſhould loue, we ſhould hate, we ſhould feare, we ſhould hope, for nothing but in God, and to his

glorie: we ſhould think and muſe vpon nothing in our minde &amp; vnderſtanding, but that which may make to the honour and glorie of God: we ſhould imploy all the powers of our bodie and all our worldly gifts to the ſame end: we ſhould do nothing to any other man, which we would not willingly, be content ſhould be done vnto vs. If we examine our ſelues by this rule, we ſhall ſee we be ſo farre from that we ſhould be, that almoſte we haue not one braunch thereof in vs, whiche will more euidently appeare, if we wil trie our ſelues by euery particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement rightly and truely vnderſtanded. Seeing then we be ſo farre from the iuſtice of Gods lawe, the curſe thereof muſt needes be due vnto vs.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 10.</note> For God ſaith, <hi>Curſed is he whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer keepeth not all thinges written in the Booke of his law.</hi> In this maner if we examine our ſelues ſincerely, we ſhall throughly knowe, what we are in the ſight of God, as well by the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our nature, as by the courſe of our euill and naughtie life: we ſhall haue ſenſe of our owne ſinne: we ſhall hate and deteſt it: we ſhal from the bottome of our heartes be ſorie for it: with trembling mindes, we ſhal feare the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie iudgement of God againſt vs, and ſo will be ſtirred vp in vs, that godly appetite, &amp; greedy deſire to eate of that ſpirituall meate, whiche onely can ſatiſfie our troubled conſcience, &amp; cure our repentant, and broken heartes. But though the appetite, &amp; deſire be neuer ſo great, in vaine he commeth to any table, that hath no mouth
<pb facs="tcp:18827:6"/>

Secondly, whether we feele in our heartes a ſtrong perſwaſion that we alſo through the merciful promiſes of God are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſame worke of our redemption.<note place="margin">

Furthermore, as it is neceſſarie to haue, both a deſire to eate ſtirred by a ſenſe and feeling of true repentance, and alſo an aſſured faith to receiue and digeſt this wholeſome and comfortable medicine of our ſoule:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> ſo becauſe God beſtoweth not his mercie by his Sonne Chriſt in vaine, or to the end we ſhould ſtil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew in ſinne: we muſt further trie our ſelues, whether we feele an vnfained deſire to riſe to a newneſſe of life, and in earneſt ſtudie, hereafter to amend our former faultes, and to frame our ſelues to a godly and honeſt conuerſation, that God in vs may be glorified, and the mouthes
<pb facs="tcp:18827:7"/>
of the enemies ſtopped. Laſtly we muſt examine our conſciences, whether we haue a feruent &amp; great deſire to call to our remembrance the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable benefite of our redemption,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>ver</hi> 24, 25, 26.</note> made by the price of his body and bloud, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſſe the ſame vnfainedly, before God, and the worlde, and to yeelde vnto him, moſt heartie thankes for the ſame, and the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of his benefites, not at this preſent time onely, but euer hereafter, vntill the time of his comming. This is the godly and Chriſtian tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of our ſelues, which if we do vſe, by the grace of Gods ſpirite working in vs, we ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, either worthie gueſtes, or much more fit then otherwiſe we ſhould be without ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Happily ſome will thinke that this admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, is a terrour and torment to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to feare men from comming to this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament, rather then an exhortation or incouragement vnto it. For if the danger, be in it ſelfe ſo great,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 27.</note> as the vnworthie receiuer ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth dampnation to himſelfe, and the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and triall ſo ſtraight, as you haue made it, it were better neuer to come to it. For what one is there among a thouſand that doeth in this manner trie his conſcience? or if he doe, he muſt needes feele ſo great want and imperfection, either in ſorrowe for his ſinnes, or in ſenſe of Gods wrath, or in weakeneſſe of his faith, or in the ſtudy of new life, or in the coldneſſe of his charitie, or in his febleneſſe to giue thanks, &amp; to ſet forth the glorie of God, or in al theſe things,
<pb facs="tcp:18827:7"/>
that he muſt needes be ouerwhelmed in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and feared to make himſelfe partaker of theſe holy miſteries. But (dearely beloued) Let not this feare ſhake our conſciences, nor driue you backe from this bleſſed table.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. <hi>ver</hi> 39.</note> This exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and triall muſt be within the bounds of humane frailtie, and God in this, as in all other doinges, for Chriſt his ſake, will vſe his mercie and clemencie, for he knoweth our corruptions and imperfections, and will haue regard of our infirmities. Onely let vs not be ſecure, ſlack and negligent, but feeling by this triall great want in our ſelues, let vs with lowly, humble, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing heartes, acknowledge the ſame, and ſay vnto God. I am ſorie (O Lord) for my ſinnes, but not as the grieuouſneſſe of them requireth, augment (O Lorde) by thy ſpirite, the ſenſe of thy wrath in mee. I beleeue and knowe with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtians, that thy ſonne hath ſhedde his bloud for me, but increaſe my faith, (O God,) &amp; helpe mine vnbeleefe. I deſire to liue according to the calling of a Chriſtian, but the fleſhe and the world maketh this ſtudy colde in me: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe thou ſtrengthen me with thy bleſſed ſpirite. I knowe it is my bounden duetie to yeeld vnto thee immortall thankes, aſwell for all other thy benefites, as principally for the whole worke of our redemption by the death of thy dearely beloued ſonne. But I feele this zeale to be ſo faint and feeble, that it is nothing according to my duetie, and for that cauſe, I lift vp mine eyes to the throne of thy mercie, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:18827:8"/>
humbly deſire thee, to pardon al my imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to heale all mine infirmities. The ſenſe and knowledge of my weaknes, may not feare me, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this holy table. For this heauenly feaſt, is a medicine for them that be ſick, a comfort to them that be penitent ſinners, a free and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gift, to ſuch as be poore and haue nothing of them ſelues.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 36.</note> Chriſt in this feaſt is giuen as meat, without which, we know, we muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie periſh. And he is giuen as life vnto vs, &amp; therefore without him, we can haue nothing but death. The beſt worthineſſe, that we can bring to theſe reuerend and holy miſteries, is, that we confeſſe our owne vnworthines, that thy mercie may make vs worthy: that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire in our ſelues, that thy grace may comfort vs: that we humble our ſelues, to the end thy goodneſſe may raiſe vs vp: that we accuſe our ſelues, to the end thy ſonne by his merite may iuſtifie vs. For though of our ſelues we are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do nothing: yet by him, we ſhalbe hable to do all thinges. Theſe or like cogitations if we haue in preparing our ſelues, to that bleſſed nouriſhment of our ſoules: he that breaketh not a bruiſed reede, nor putteth out ſmoking flaxe, will not caſt aſide our infirmitie, but wil mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully receiue vs. The ſorrowfull Father, which with care for his ſonne cried vnto Chriſt. <hi>I beleeue Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marke.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 24.</note> 
               <hi>but helpe mine vnbeleefe,</hi> Though his faith, as it might appeare, was very weake yet obtained he his purpoſe at Chriſt his hand to haue his ſonne by miracle healed. If our
<pb facs="tcp:18827:8"/>
faith be but as a graine of muſtard ſeede,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 20.</note> yet it wil much preuail with Gods mercie. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Chriſt which were admitted to his laſt ſupper, were notwithſtanding weak, &amp; touched with many infirmities, although thei were not altogether wicked &amp; faithleſſe, as Iudas was: they beleeued in Chriſt, they loued Chriſt, &amp; they loued one another, &amp; yet at the very table of the Lord, they ſhewed their weaknes. <hi>Peter</hi> not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome reproch of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſidue, preferred himſelf before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>ver.</hi> 33.</note> 
               <hi>Though al other</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by thee, yet wil not I be offended by thee.</hi> They am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bitiouſly contended among themſelues, which of them ſhold be the greater. I wil not mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that immediately after Supper, they through timerouſnes fled from Chriſt, &amp; for the time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoke him, which was an euident token, of the weaknes of their faith, after the knowledge of his doctrine, &amp; experience of many &amp; wonderfull miracles. Yet it pleaſed the great mercie of our ſauiour, fauourably to accept them, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them as ſingular inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of his grace. We may not therefore, for our weakenes, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection deſpaire or refuſe the comfort of that heauenly table, but rather let vs in all dutifull ſort, approch thervnto, &amp; pray moſt hartily (eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of vs al) that we may be fit and worthy gueſtes for the ſame, which God our Father grant vs for his ſonnes ſake, Chriſt Ieſu our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, by the working of his moſte holy, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſpirite, to whom be all honour, prayſe, and glorie, for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
