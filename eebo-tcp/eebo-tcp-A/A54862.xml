            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Bishops of <hi>London</hi> and of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and several others, have a most undoubted Right to dispose of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends, (such at least as the Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> hath,) and that Right the more unquestionable, by being <hi>held</hi> of the <hi>Supream,</hi> and <hi>derived</hi> from it, and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi> thereunto. <hi>A Sole and Sovereign</hi> Right wholly <hi>exclusive of the King's,</hi> (which is all I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend against, and which my Lord Bishop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> seems to aim at, and effect, or else his Lordship and I agree,) I am verily perswaded, <hi>none</hi> of those Bishops will pretend to. It cannot be said with any Truth, that <hi>All</hi> the Bishopricks

I have named, wherein the King gives <hi>All</hi> the Prebends, the Bishops none, are not of <hi>Old,</hi> but <hi>New</hi> Foundation. For <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>Norwich</hi> are very <hi>Old; Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Rochester</hi> two of the <hi>Oldest</hi> we have in <hi>England.</hi> Besides that, the King's Power and Right in the Church of <hi>Sarum,</hi> is greater than in many others; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his <hi>Old Free Chappel,</hi> which I shall prove in the next Chapter (and cannot be disproved by some <hi>Negatives,</hi> from some Interested and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate Opposers of the Prerogative,) but also because the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were the <hi>Co-Founders</hi> of that Cathedral in a Literal Sence, as well as <hi>Founders</hi> in the Sence of our Common and Statute Law: The <hi>Co-Founders</hi> at least, because <hi>Osmund</hi> had his <hi>All</hi> from the Bounty of <hi>Will.</hi> 1. and held his All of that King's Favour, under Knights Service during Pleasure, for which I cited Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>Matth.

            <p>It seemeth strange to most men, (who have considered the matter throughly,) that the King who gets the Right of giving every Ecclesiastical Possession in <hi>England,</hi> not only where <hi>Church men,</hi> but where <hi>Saecular</hi> men are Patrons, by promoting an Incumbent unto a <hi>Bishoprick,</hi> should immediately <hi>loose All</hi> even in That very Church where he makes the Bishop: Or that the King who hath <hi>All</hi> in his own Disposal, during the Vacancy of <hi>All</hi> the Bishopricks in <hi>England,</hi> should have <hi>nothing</hi> to dispose of, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Bishop's good leave,) as soon as the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies are filled, tho' filled up freely by himself. They are <hi>Betrayers of the Churches Rights</hi> who go about to <hi>undermine</hi> and <hi>betray the King's;</hi> And they <hi>tempt</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and his Royal Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, to let their Bishopricks lye void, as <hi>Q. Eliz.</hi> and her <hi>Ancestors</hi> thought fit to do, even as far as for 20, or 30, yea, for 40, years together. Signal Instances of which in <hi>the most</hi> of our Churches, if not in <hi>All,</hi> 'twere too easy for me to give, if it would not occasion too great a Length. Alas! we may judge of the King's Regale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Sarum,</hi> (supposing there had been never a Royal Chappel in the Old Castle, which yet I shall shortly make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,) by the <hi>Exercises</hi> of it in other Churches.

Hen. 8. Oxford</hi> and <hi>Peterborough</hi> out of the same:) Tho' the Diocess of <hi>Lincoln</hi> is still the greatest, ('its Parishes being no fewer than 1255.)

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>WHereas 'twas affirmed by the Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> to the Lords, <hi>That there never was a Time when either the Dean and Canons were exempt from all Iurisdiction of the Bishop of</hi> Sarum. The contrary to it is <hi>confessed</hi> and <hi>strongly proved</hi> by his Lordship himself in the very next Words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein his Lordship cites <hi>The Composition</hi> that was made between Bishop <hi>Waltham,</hi> Dean <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacute,</hi> and the Then <hi>Chapter</hi> of the said Church, which was no longer since than in the Year 1391. whereas the <hi>Absolute Exemption</hi> of the Dean and All the Canons from the Bishops Jurisdiction, was in the Year 1095. Between which two Dates, there was an Interval of almost 300 Years.</p>
               <p>Which <hi>Composition,</hi> so called, was indeed a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy</hi> of the said <hi>Bishop, Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> with <hi>Pope Boniface</hi> the <hi>Ninth,</hi> by whom it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and for which by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> (even (<hi>c</hi>) <hi>Then in force</hi>) they did incur a <hi>Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire:</hi> Which All the Bishops ever <note n="d" place="bottom">Judge <hi>Ienkins,</hi> p. 24. say, <hi>'Tis</hi> Treason <hi>to pay Obedience to the Pope, or to any other than to the King.</hi> For which he cites 23 Eliz. cap. 1. and 3 Jac. cap. 4. §. 22, 23.</note> since are humbly conceived to have incurred, who have presumed to Act according to <hi>That Conspiracy,</hi> I.

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:63880:28"/>
have severally been <hi>Sworn</hi> by all the Bishops, Deans and Chapters. That they would keep, and cause to be kept (as much as in them lay) that Fundamental Statute of <hi>Osmund,</hi> with all the Priviledges, Dignities, Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and Exemptions therein contained; of which Oaths the said Conspiracy or Composition is a <hi>Professed</hi> Violation, as shall be shewn in its proper place. Secondly, in respect of the heavy Curse, which <hi>Osmund</hi> denounced against All those who should dare to pervert the said Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Constitutions in any kind. V. Against its own <hi>Being,</hi> by reason of its several <hi>Inconsistences</hi> with it self, and of the several Nullities contained in it. Lastly, Against the <hi>Well-being,</hi> if not against the very <hi>Being</hi> of the whole College within the Cathedral Church of <hi>Sarum,</hi> by reason of its most scandalous and most mischievous Effects. But of each in its Order.</p>
               <p>§. 1. First, It was a Conspiracy against the King of <hi>England</hi> and his Prerogative, who is in Law declared to be the <hi>Founder</hi> as well as <hi>Patron</hi> of all the Archibishopricks and Bishopricks in <hi>England,</hi> but took care in his Original Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter granted to his Favourite <hi>Osmund,</hi> (sealed first with the Seal of <hi>Will.</hi> I. and <hi>then</hi> with the Seal of <hi>Will.</hi> II.) to <hi>exempt</hi> his Dean and All his Prebendaries or Canons from the Bishops Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in as <hi>full</hi> and as <hi>plain</hi> a manner, as Latin words could express an <hi>Exemption</hi> by. In words so carefully contrived against all possible Affectation of Jurisdiction over the College of Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in any succeeding Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> that what the present Lord Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> would make an Argument for himself and his Affected Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63880:28"/>
makes quite <hi>against</hi> him. For the <hi>Voice</hi> and the <hi>Place</hi> which the Bishop has in <hi>Chapter</hi> (common to him with all the 52 Canons) he has as <hi>Prebendary of Pottern,</hi> not as Bishop of <hi>Sarum;</hi> nor has he so much as a <hi>Second</hi> Voice as he is <hi>Prebendary of Blewbery,</hi> because he was never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it by Installation, nor lawfully could be. For when <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. <hi>had given two Prebends to One man in one Church,</hi> Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> complained of it in his Letter, as Unlawful, and Uncanonical. (Not denying the <hi>King's Right</hi> of conferring Prebends, but the <hi>Evil use</hi> of it.) So that the Bishop in <hi>Capitulo</hi> has but one single Vote, and the liberty to propose what he thinks may tend to the good of the Church, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of what he takes to be amiss, (as every other Prebendary has as free liberty to do,) and to be punished or amended by the Authority of Dean and Chapter.

All which was alledged <hi>with effect</hi> in the Chapters <hi>Accusation</hi> of Bishop <hi>Erghum to</hi> Archbishop <hi>Sudbury</hi> (1375,) whom they charged before his Grace at once with <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for affecting a Jurisdiction over the Canons when the Dean was Dead, and the Deanry Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, at a Time wherein the Bishop had a <hi>little colour for it,</hi> which might excuse his Sin <hi>a Tanto.</hi> Much more might they have done whilst the Dean was yet Living, if such an Incroachment had been attempted.

to the Kings <hi>Free Chappel,</hi> (which any man may <hi>deny</hi> whose Tongue is his own, but no Man living can <hi>disprove,</hi>) hath already been evinced, and shall be further, as Occasion shall be offered.

                  <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>'s Statute; though he was in all his time the most assuming Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> even from that to this day. Whereas in the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the aforesaid Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> with the then Bishop, Dean and Chapters, there is this aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the astonishing design against the King; that it hath a <hi>special Salvo</hi> for the <hi>Popes</hi> and his <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Sarums</hi> Rights, but <hi>none</hi> at all for the <hi>Kings:</hi> Yea, as if that were not enough to affront the King by, it takes upon it to decree the whole Revenue of the <hi>Deanry, Decanatu vacante,</hi> to the Chapter; which, (as well as the Revenues of all the void Bishopricks in <hi>England,</hi>) belong by Law to <hi>The King alone.</hi> Lastly, <hi>The Goods of the Church</hi> (as the Chapter words it) which <hi>Osmund</hi> gave to the Dean and Canons, he gave them even <hi>so,</hi> as he had received them of the King, with a <hi>Libere, prout Ipse obtinueram;</hi>

the Bishop pretends to be the Deans Visitor; which is to take upon him a <hi>Regal,</hi> or <hi>Metropoliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Authority, to <hi>which two alone</hi> the Dean of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> is <hi>subordinate</hi> in his <hi>Peculiars,</hi> as all others are who have Episcopal Jurisdiction within <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;</hi> even abstracting from the Relation the Deans of <hi>Sarum</hi> ever had to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Free Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> whereof the <hi>Privileges</hi> remain, and were ever reserved, though the <hi>Formality</hi> is obscured in a Great Cathedral Church.

No Instance can be given of any <hi>Will proved</hi> within the Close by any Bishop, or any Letters of Administration granted, or any matter of Instance tryed, or any Fornication punished by any Bishop since the Foundation:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63880:34"/>

upon the Dean's peculiar Jurisdiction, by Dr. <hi>Elliot</hi> the Bishops Chancellor, in citing <hi>Wickham</hi> within the Close, <hi>Absolves</hi> the said <hi>Wickham.</hi> Whereupon the Bishop makes his complaint to the Archbishop Dr. <hi>Gilbert Sheldon.</hi> The business came to an Hearing in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>College Gallery</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> before the <hi>said Archbishop,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> Lord <hi>Chancellour of England;</hi> (the King then residing in <hi>Oxford.</hi>) And the Issue was this; That the Bishop should not intermeddle with any Ecclesiastical Censures, things, or Persons, out of his own Palace and Family; but that the whole decision of Ecclesiastical Matters within the said Close, did, and do purely, wholly and solely belong unto the Dean.</p>

Yea, since the present Lord Bishops, and the present Dean's Time, there was a Crime committed within his Lordships own Pallace, and by his Lordships chief Domestick; which being a Crime of Ecclesiastical cognizance, was by consequence to be punished by the King's Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Laws. The Bishop applied himself first by Letters to the Dean and Chapter <hi>conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim,</hi> for the Punishing of the chief Party in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63880:35"/>
that Commission; proposing the <hi>Composition</hi> to them, whereby his Lordship was in hopes a Correction <hi>de bene esse</hi> might be favourably inflicted. The Dean and Chapter met on purpose in Dr. <hi>Drake</hi>'s House, to Read and to consider of the said <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi> Which having done, They unanimously agreed in this Judgment, (of which they sent his Lordship word,) That the whole <hi>Composition</hi> (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it to be valid,) was wholly impertinent to the Matter in hand: And that none but the Dean alone, as the <hi>Sole Ordinary of the Close,</hi> could Summon both Parties into his Consistory Court, and put the Law in Execution. The Dean how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever made a delay, because the Principal Offender had committed the Fact in the <hi>Bishop's Palace,</hi> which he was willing to esteem a place <hi>Exempted</hi> from the Decanal Jurisdiction. And this he pleaded to the Lord Bishop, whom he desired to correct his own Domestick in his own Family, or in his own Court, which the Dean said, he would warrant his Lordship the doing of by Letters Dimissory, or License under the Seal of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canal Office. But his Lordship urged with great strength of Reason, as well as Earnestness; (1.) That such a Liberty in the Close, was more than either the Dean could give away lawfully, or the Bishop receive.

               <p>Now it is to be noted, that the Parish of <hi>Broad-Chalk,</hi> is under the Bishop's Jurisdiction; and that the Lord Bishop was then at home, in his Palace within the Close; and that his Leave had been sufficient without the Deans, had he had any Jurisdiction within the Close; much more had his Jurisdiction been <hi>Archiepiscopal,</hi> or <hi>Regal,</hi> and so Superior to the Deans. Lastly, That the

Bishops <hi>Surrogate,</hi> knowing well that his Lordship had none at all within the Close, (though his Lordship and the Sub-Dean have all between them in the City,) did therefore make his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, to the Dean, and the Dean only. In like manner the Collection which was made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Close for the rebuilding of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Redemption of Captives, and the like, was made and returned by the Dean only and his Officers, according to the King's Order and Direction.</p>

But being afterwards <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Sarum,</hi> (as after that, Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi>) he got a Commission from the <hi>Archbishop of the Province</hi> to visit the Church upon occasion of the Case of Dr. <hi>Zouch,</hi> and said, he was <hi>fultus Iurisdictione Metropolitana;</hi> knowing well, and confessing, that, <hi>as Bishop of Sarum,</hi> he had no right to Visit the <hi>Choral Vicars,</hi> much less the <hi>Chapter,</hi> much less the <hi>Dean;</hi> for if he had, he would not have needed any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

The said Exemption of <hi>All the Canons</hi> of the <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>lesser</hi> Chapter, who make a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour</hi> Corporation whereof their Dean is the Head, may be yet farther proved by the Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>All the Vicars,</hi> who are an <hi>Inferiour</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, from the Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi>'s Power and Jurisdiction. For it appears by the Vicars Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which they enjoy from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> (as the Dean and Chapter do Theirs,) that they are only subjected to the correction of Dean and Chapter, not at all to the Bishops, who can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>put in, nor punish;</hi> much less, <hi>put out</hi> a Vicar, or a Lay Clerk, however criminal. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Vicars, (as well as the Lay Clerks) take an Oath at their Admission of paying Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto the <hi>Dean,</hi> and to the <hi>Dean only</hi> whilst he is present, and in the Dean's Absence to the Deans <hi>Locum-tenens,</hi> authorized under the Seal of the Decanal Office: But none at all to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> whether Present, or Absent; which was eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged by this present Bishop in his own Palace, when in the presence of the Dean and Chapter, and all the Vicars, his Lordship protested three several times to Mr. <hi>Hardwick,</hi> the Vicars Procurator, and Prolocutor, and to his Brethren then present, <hi>That if it were in his Power, he would expel them every one,</hi> for their then Recalcitration and Opposition, both to the Bishop and to the Chapter, when good Lawyers told the Vicars, they had the Law on their Side. The Vicars were not a little pleased at his Lordship's <hi>Brutum Fulmen,</hi> and confession of his <hi>No-Power</hi> over the Vicars within the Close, three times repeated. Nor could any but the Dean bring
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63880:37"/>
those Vicars to a Submission and full compliance, which he soon after did with the best effect.</p>

Even since my coming to keep my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence at <hi>Sarum,</hi> the <hi>20th.</hi> of this instant <hi>Iune,</hi> I find two <hi>Notorious and Publick Confessions in effect, of</hi> the Lord Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> his having no Power to Visit <hi>within the Close,</hi> whether the Dean will or no, or without the Dean's <hi>Leave, Concurrence,</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> under the Seal of his Decanal Office, as well as under his own Hand; which being <hi>sought,</hi> but <hi>refused</hi> (very honestly and prudently) by the Dean's Surrogate <hi>in his absence,</hi> and <hi>without his knowledge;</hi> the Dean's <hi>Locum-tenens,</hi> for the Chapter, (as the Sub Dean Mr. <hi>Kent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Professor, Ecclesiae Cathedralis</hi> Sarum <hi>Decanus, &amp; ejus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Ecclesiae Capitulum, Universis &amp; Singulis,</hi> &amp;c. Finding This to be done 1. Without my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and 2. With my very great Abhorrence;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63880:37"/>
3. Against my Judgment; 4. Against my Right of Jurisdiction; 5. Against the King, of whom I hold my Jurisdiction under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> (and unto <hi>whose Imperial Crown my Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is annexed by 32 Acts of Parliament;</hi> 6. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>my self in mine own name,</hi> and Poetically brought in upon the stage, <hi>Citing my self, and the Bishop,</hi> as the Prebendary of <hi>Blewbery,</hi> but not as Prebendary of <hi>Pottern,</hi> (which the Bishop is also) Comically personated whether I will or no, like a Puppet <note n="y" place="bottom">St. fol. 44. b.</note> moving by Wires; 7. Against Express Statute to the contrary; 8. Against the Oaths of the Members of the Chapter, who had an Hand in the usurpation (which I am sure but few had;) 9. Against the Trust reposed in my Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and 10. Against the very License or Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, whereby I had enabled him in my Absence to call Chapters for the taking care of God's worship, the keeping of Statutes and Laudable Customs of the Church, as far as they agree with the Word of God, and with the Law of the Land, and for the Correction of the Canons and Members, but so limited, as I have said, not for the using the Common Seal at all, much less at his Pleasure, without my knowledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and against my self; I say finding This, and a world of Absurdities (too many, and too great to be recounted in this Pinch of Time;) I inferred their <hi>Conviction of my sole Right,</hi> as Dean, to cite the 52 Prebendaries and all other members who had sworn obedience to me, from their conceiving themselves forced to run so great a Risque, as that of <note n="z" place="bottom">D. <hi>D.</hi> Longland.

Rather than set up such a Citation <hi>without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Name,</hi> or in Any man's Name but Mine; and for their false using the <hi>Common Seal</hi> of <hi>Dean and Chapter,</hi> for want of the Decanal Peculiar Seal, which Alone had been Authentick. Therefore under my Seal of Office belonging to me, and me only, as an Ordinary, and Judge, of the King's Ecclesiastical Court within my Peculiar the Close of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and elsewhere, I made my <note n="a" place="bottom">

Before I come to prove This, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending to some Particulars, I think it useful to premise this General Observation, to wit, that the Statutes which are Authentick, both by Law, and in themselves, as having been made by our Founders, the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Osmund,</hi> and by our Later <hi>Monarchs</hi> of <hi>England, Hen. 8. Ed.</hi> 6. and Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> which alone are obliging both to the Bishop, Dean and Chapter, are of All other Statutes the <hi>most neglected and out of Use,</hi> (to say no more
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63880:39"/>
at this time) whilst the Statutes of several <hi>Popes,</hi> and of several Popish Bishops and Deans and Chapters of <hi>Sarum,</hi> however selfish and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, against the Law of the Land, and the Canons of the Church, and very oppressive to Posterity, and therefore fit to have perished with Those that made them, have been hitherto <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> (to the hazarding of Souls) with too much strictness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N.</hi> III. Now to demonstrate the Contradictions, and other Mischievous effects, which have been principally caused by the Infamous <hi>Composition</hi> of the said <hi>Boniface</hi> the Ninth, with the then Bishop, Dean and Chapter (Birds of a Feather every one at that Time, during the loose and weak Reign of the most careless <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. of whom Historians give This Character, That of All Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors and Councils he did constantly take the Worst,) I cannot better begin than with the Words of Bishop <hi>Henchman,</hi> once the <hi>Chantor,</hi> and a <hi>Residentiary,</hi> and after Bishop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and at last Bishop of <hi>London;</hi> when being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted by Dean <hi>Brideoak</hi> about the compelling of certain Prebendaries at large to confirm their Leases by the Common Seal of Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and also to pay the <hi>Fifth part</hi> of their Prebends for their Non-residence Thirteen Weeks in the Year, according to <hi>Osmund</hi>'s Constitution, and the Statute of Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> with the concurrence and combination of the then Dean and Chapter, sent his <note n="b" place="bottom">From <hi>London</hi> House, <hi>May 7. 1668.</hi>
                  </note> Answer in these Words following. <q>You must also understand, that the <hi>great Vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and Changes</hi> which <hi>Those</hi>

Do you think that now a Prebendary <hi>not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Residence</hi> may be <hi>mulcted</hi> at <hi>Quinta parte Praebendae,</hi> because <hi>he doth not Reside in the Close of</hi> Salisbury <hi>Thirteen Weeks in every Year?</hi> Yet this is the Statute of Bishop <hi>Iewel.</hi> Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu <hi>Fratrum nostrorum cum consensu Capituli</hi> (the Dean was absent) <hi>statuimus veterem Antecessoris nostri</hi> Osmundi <hi>Constitutionem, quam de ea retulit, in integrum esse restituendam; hoc est Canonicos hujus</hi>

Can a Prebendary <hi>not Residentiary</hi> be <hi>compelled</hi> now so to <hi>Reside?</hi> Indeed he that lives upon his own Land, or Farm, and not in his Parsonage with Cure; nor where his Residence is by Law allowed, is a great Offender. But if an Archdeacon or Prebendary take upon him to Reside in <hi>Sarum</hi> (<hi>being no Residentiary</hi>) he is liable to a Sore Mulct upon an Information in the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</hi> Will you admit every one into Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that shall offer himself, and <hi>protest de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidendo?</hi> You will soon be weary of that.

                  </q> Thus far Bishop <hi>Henchman</hi> exposed those Statutes to ridicule, by which All the Canons (in number 52) are <hi>obliged</hi> to Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, yet <hi>not allowed</hi> to Reside; Have a <hi>Right</hi> to be Residents, yet <hi>no permission</hi> to enjoy it. 'Tis their <hi>Duty</hi> and their Crime, to Reside in the Close and the Cathedral Thirteen weeks every Year. They <hi>must,</hi> and yet they <hi>may not</hi> perform the Will of the Founder, confessed by Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> to be expresly the <hi>Subordinate</hi> Founder's Will, and by consequence <hi>the Will</hi> of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Founders, <hi>Will.</hi> 1. and <hi>Will.</hi> 2. whose Seals were set to <hi>Osmund</hi>'s Charter.

In flat contradiction to the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Statute, and Oath of <hi>Residence,</hi> and to the late repeated Statute of <hi>Bishop Iewel</hi> with the <hi>then Chapter,</hi> the present Bishop and the then Chapter made a New Statute (<hi>Octob.</hi> 3. 1672, Sethi <hi>Anno sexto</hi>) to this effect, That if they who have taken the Oath of continual Residence, keep not so much as <hi>Three Months Residence,</hi> they shall pay Five Pounds for each Months <hi>Non-Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> or 15 <hi>l.</hi> for the <hi>Non-Residence</hi> of the <hi>Year:</hi> so that for 15 <hi>l. per annum</hi> they may be <hi>Residents</hi> good enough <hi>without Residing,</hi> and save 100 <hi>l. per</hi>

Of whieh the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Bishop <hi>Henchman</hi> in his Letter to the said Dean, did write these words—[And I must add, That since <hi>Prebendaries</hi> and their Tenants have understood, that Leases Demised by Sole Corporations (according to the Statutes of the Realm) receive no strength by Capitular Confirmation, you shall do well to <hi>perswade</hi> and <hi>invite</hi> the Members of your Church to observe the good Rules lately made concerning Leases; but be not hasty to <hi>compel</hi> by Censures or Penalties, &amp;c.—<hi>A little after, touching the Statute en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Prebendal Contributions, by way of Tax towards the Repairing of the Church, the Reverend Bishop adds thus,</hi>—Take the best and surest course you can to have the Help of the <hi>Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> but take heed you adventure not to compel them, lest you meet with Consequences which may to a good degree frustrate a Work of so high Importance.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N.</hi> VI. All the Oaths which have been <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,</hi> much more those which have been <hi>imposed,</hi> by Bishop, Dean and Chapter upon <hi>Prebendaries</hi> or <hi>Vicars,</hi> in any Matter not belonging to their Spiritual Jurisdictions, or not in a way of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring Justice, have been <hi>against Law,</hi> and <hi>the King's Prerogative.</hi> The power to give and impose Oaths being so peculiar to the Prerog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative Royal, that 'tis punishable to do it, <hi>without,</hi> or <hi>beyond</hi> the bounds of the King's Commission, by way of Indictment or Information, as an high Misdemeanor: Nor can any Custom legitimate such an invented Oath, unless it had a <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>just</hi> beginning. The House of Commons are so sensible of the want of this Power, not only to <hi>impose,</hi> but <hi>administer</hi> Oaths to Witnesses, (who, being <hi>voluntary,</hi> are as ready to Swear, as to appear,) that they often accept of Evidence
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63880:41"/>
upon bare Averments. Nor can the Voluntary <hi>Submission</hi> of the Prebendaries or Vicars create unlawful Power in the Bishop, Dean and Chapter conjoyned, which otherwise by Law they have not, either to <hi>impose</hi> or to <hi>administer</hi> an Oath, nor excuse them in so doing. For however such Oaths so administred and taken, not to lett a Lease upon such or such Terms as the Law allows, (as for Example for Three Lives without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,) do bind the Takers of them in <hi>Conscience,</hi> yet <hi>in Law</hi> they are illegal, null, and void. And so 'twas declared by the late Lord Chancellor upon occasion of a Suit in that Court depending.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N.</hi> VII. By a Statute or a Decree of the Bishop, Dean and Chapter of <hi>Sarum,</hi> made in <hi>October</hi> 1671. no Lease is to be Lett by any Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (however he is singly a Corporation,) <hi>without three Conditions,</hi> (by Law allowed, but prohibited by them,) and <hi>all Three under the pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication;</hi> which yet ('tis well known) cannot lawfully be inflicted for any matter or crime which is not made to be <hi>so punishable</hi> by some Statute of the Land: Nor can any thing less than the King or Parliament <hi>de novo</hi> create, or make a thing criminal. And though the breach of such Conditions in the letting of a Lease (which Conditions are wholsom) be supposed to be a Crime in such as have consented to them, yet the <hi>Matter being Temporal</hi> it is not punishable in Law by an <hi>Excommunication.</hi> Yet this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the sore Mischiefs, whereof the aforesaid <hi>Composition</hi> hath been the Occasion of the Cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N.</hi> VIII. But there are other effects of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Simony</hi> seems plainly not only to be <hi>allowed,</hi> but even <hi>established</hi> by a <hi>Law,</hi> (such as a Bishop
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63880:42"/>
and the Chapter can make <hi>de facto</hi> by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Composition,</hi> which owes its chief force to Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>Ninth;</hi>) whilst men are made to pay dearly for their Places of Preferment, which by the King are freely granted. For no sooner have the Residents in the Church of <hi>Sarum</hi> taken their Oaths, That they neither have given, nor will give any Sum or Sums for those Places unto which they are admitted; but presently, by the <note n="g" place="bottom">De Finibus Canonicorum ad Residentiam Receptorum. <hi>St. fol. 58, 59.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Statute</hi> of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the <hi>Fourth,</hi> even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was deposed by the Council of <hi>Basil</hi> (when for Money he would do any thing,) there is (besides all other payments by way of customary Fees) a great Fine for <hi>Entrance, Finis pro Introitu,</hi> to be paid in ready Money, or well secured by Obligation. And though at first no more was paid than <hi>Forty shillings</hi> to the Fabrick, (<hi>A. D.</hi> 1319.) yet by the Statute of <hi>Dean Sydenham,</hi> and his then Chapter, (1428.) Authorized at <hi>Florence</hi> by the said Titular Pope, (1442.) each Resident <hi>with</hi> Dignity is to pay for his Entrance 105 <hi>l.</hi> and each <hi>without</hi> Dignity is to pay for the same <hi>71 l. 13s. 4d.</hi> (besides a greater Sum required by a much younger Statute, of which hereafter.) This <hi>Statute</hi> is bad enough; but the <hi>Custom</hi> is worse: For besides that the Fines for Entrance are <hi>diverted</hi> from the <hi>Fabrick,</hi> and <hi>divided</hi> among the <hi>Residents</hi> of the <hi>Chapter;</hi> the <hi>Custom</hi> hath violated the Statute, in exacting no more from men <hi>with</hi> Dignity, than <hi>without</hi> it; so that the latter pay <hi>too much</hi> (though less than the Statute does require,) and the former <hi>too little,</hi> because much less than is due by Statute, which yet they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63880:42"/>
pretend (and that with Contention) to be in force. Only the Dean of all four Dignities must be excepted, who pay by Custom to the heighth of what the Statute does enjoyn, and by Custom much more. Nor is this all: For Tyrant Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom which keeps up that Statute, does beat it down at the same time in five remarkable degrees, for which no Creature was ever yet able to give a Reason. Yet these are Customs and Statutes, which they who take to be Obliging do Swear to keep. But as if this were not enough, for a Learned poor man to be beggared by in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, (as how many the most deserving have the least Portion of Mony, and none to spare, and often dye without Re-imbursement?) there was another Statute made by a <hi>Bishop, Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> as well without the <hi>King's</hi> as the <hi>Pope's</hi> concurrence, and without the concurrence of <hi>Common</hi> Sense: For by force of that Statute (another effect of the <hi>Composition</hi>) every Resident who is living, must fast a Year from all Commons; and every Resident when he is dead, must eat a Years Commons in his Grave. At least in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>'s sense, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for what he does by his Executor, he interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively does; and accordingly 'tis said (with as much Pithiness, as Impropriety,) to be the Dead Resident his <hi>Annus post Mortem;</hi> that is, his <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius anni proficua undecunque Provenientia.</hi> 'Twas not the Christian Self-denial of those Usurping Legislators, who first invented this Law in their own behalf. A Law resented very deeply by some Publick-spirited Bishops of other Churches, who have expressed their Resentments to the now Dean of <hi>Sarum,</hi> with a great deal of holy
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63880:43"/>
Indignation; and heartily <hi>wished</hi> for a Remedy of this and other Impositions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N.</hi> IX. But hardly can a Remedy be brought about, but by the long and mighty Arm of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majesty, which in a Royal Visitation can abolish Old Statutes, and make us New Ones; Statutes suitable to our <hi>Religion,</hi> by Law estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. Statutes not repugnant to the King's <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Prerogative.</hi> Statutes agreeable with themselves, and to be sworn to the <hi>safety</hi> of all mens <hi>Consciences</hi> and <hi>Souls.</hi> Lastly, Statutes not expiring with the Breath of them that make them, like those Royal Statutes which were made heretofore for the Church of <hi>Sarum:</hi> For those of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and Q. <hi>Elizab.</hi> were never yet so much as <hi>entred</hi> into the Statute Book; insomuch that the former and present Dean could never get a sight of them.

               <head>An <hi>APPENDIX</hi> to the Three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapters.</head>
               <p>§. 1. MR. <hi>Yeats</hi> was so unwilling, that either the Dean of <hi>Sarum,</hi> or any other of that Church, should have any share with him in the Honour or in the Blame of his Project of the Four Articles, that he writ an honest Letter to a Person of Quality in the Countrey, (as before to some at Court, and to the Lord Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) who permitted the Dean's Son to transcribe as much of it, as he thought would conduce to his Father's Service and Satisfaction: And 'tis as follow's.</p>
               <p>[<hi>I am heartily sorry that any should be so Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as still to suspect the Dean's privity to my design, after so much evidence and conviction to the contrary; and therefore to shame them, I am ready to undergo</hi> whatever Test <hi>shall be put upon me, to declare that the Dean was neither</hi> directly <hi>nor</hi> indirectly, nec per se, nec per alium, <hi>acquainted with my design, but every way as ignorant thereof, as the Child unborn; and much less abetting me therein, than the Bishop himself from whom I had indeed two Inducements, but</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:63880:48"/>
                  <hi>from the Dean none, nay less than none; this being the only way I had to incur the Dean's Displeasure, but withal to procure a Favour from the Bishop, or at least from the King himself. The</hi> only offence <hi>that I Can charge my self herein to be guilty of,</hi> and for which I do, and must ever beg the Pardon of Mr. Dean, <hi>is not only that I drew up those Articles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his</hi> Privity, <hi>or</hi> Assistance, but also without his knowledge or consent, <hi>referr'd my self for Proof of them</hi> to Books and Papers in his Hands. <hi>Truth is, the knowledge I had of the chief things suggested by me to the Lords Commissioners, was principally</hi> from a Sheet of Reasons whereof Copies had been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed into several mens hands, as well of both Houses of Parliament, as private Persons, One of which Copies I have here with me, <hi>penned by the Dean about Six Years since, which Sheet was Entitled,</hi>—Certain Memoirs of things pleadable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Bill then prepared for the taking away of all Peculiar Jurisdictions, &amp;c. <hi>wherein among others, I found this very observable Passage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dean and <note n="f" place="bottom">Note that this was an error in those Memoirs. For the Dean was <hi>Alone</hi> before the Conquest, and some while <hi>After</hi> without any Chapter, as now the Dean of the King's Chappel at <hi>White-Hall is.</hi>
                  </note> Canons of <hi>Sarum</hi> had their abode before the Conquest in <hi>Old Castle</hi> called <hi>Caesar</hi>'s <hi>Burg,</hi> and corruptly <hi>Sarisberg,</hi> by the <hi>Brittains, Sorbiodunum.</hi> It was at the first <hi>the King</hi>'s <hi>Free Chappel, as Windsor is</hi> at this day, wherein the Dean (<hi>under the King</hi>) had more than Episcopal Jurisdiction. <hi>Vide Vetus Registr. Miscell. &amp; Registr. Dom.</hi> Richardi <hi>Episc.</hi> Sarum.</p>
               <p>[<hi>'Twas from this, and certain other Passages there following, (seconded by what</hi> I heard from some

But for the Reverend Dean of</hi> Sarum, <hi>he had no manner of knowledge of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, or of my Two Inducements <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o it, nor of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Mayor and Magistrates of</hi> Marlborough, <hi>nor of those Noble Persons who did promote it; and therefore as I have highly though undesignedly diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged him, by acting as I did, without his Privity, and (as I found since) against his Will; so I have, and do, and ever will beg his Pardon; which whether I ever obtain, or not, I will be ever his Vindicator in the bottom of my Heart, from his having had the least share, or so much as knowledge of my Rashness and Precipitancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. II. Thus far Mr. <hi>Yeats</hi> word for word; and as truly as ever any man spake: He offered also to confirm it in open Court upon Oath, which makes me say, that those men are unworthy, and must not expect to be believed upon their Oaths, much less upon their Words, who will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Dean of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cornelius Yeats</hi> of <hi>Marlborough</hi> either upon their Words, or upon their Oaths. Mr. <hi>Yeats</hi> his Character is no where fitter to be seen, than in the famous Petition of the Mayor and Magistrates of <hi>Marlborough</hi> to the King, Presented by the hands of the Lord <hi>Bruce</hi> in his behalf, whose great Parts and greater Piety are celebrated by Them, (both to the King, and the Lords Commissioners,) who have the best <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> and <hi>knowledge</hi> of him. And not yet to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63880:49"/>
mention those Horrid and Scandalous Reports, which Mr. <hi>Yeats</hi> his bitter Enemies have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under, and still do labour.</p>
               <p>There are not any either of his, or of the Dean of <hi>Sarum</hi>'s Enemies, who can prove so convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly that they had not any hand in, or Assent to, or Connivance at, or Knowledge of the most execrable Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> (until they had it by report,) as the said Dean hath proved, and can prove, that he had <hi>no hand in, or Assent to, or Connivance at, or Knowledge of,</hi> Mr. <hi>Yeats</hi> his Project of the Four Articles, until he was informed of it by the Lord Bishop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and by the Chapter of the same, in a Letter from Mr. <hi>Frome.</hi> For Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi> being dead, can attest nothing on their behalf; and they have nothing but their own Oaths whereby to clear their own Innocence, to which they have forfeited all Belief with considering men. But Mr. <hi>Yeats</hi> is still living to clear the Dean of <hi>Sarum</hi> upon his Oath, the which he offered in open Court, and will be ever ready to take, and who will ever find Belief from All who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his unblameable Conversation, which will every where have credit, where his Enemies have None. Nor hath he, or the Dean of <hi>Sarum</hi> any Enemies they know of, who are not Enemies at the same time, both to God, and the King, and the Church of <hi>England.</hi> 'Tis the Nature of Christian Charity, not to suspect others hastily, of any ill thing which it abhors; whilst they who are wont to do Injuries, suspect others of the like. Nothing hitherto can be said to clear the Regular and Episcopal Clergy from a suspition of being Papists, or Popishly affected, with the whole Dissenting and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63880:50"/>
Party; and they who suspected, or rather <hi>pretended</hi> to suspect the Dean of <hi>Sarum</hi> of a Plot to deprive the Bishop of a Right to give Prebends, even immediately after the Bishop had promised a Prebend to the Dean's Son, (of his own accord, and undesired, which added most of all to the Obligation,) are like those most Malitious, and Unexcusable Fanaticks, who pretended to suspect the King himself, not only of contriving the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> but also of being in the plot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his own Life and Kingdom. See the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Address to all the Freeholders and Freemen of</hi> England; part. 1. pag. 45, and 50. and part. 2. pag. 2, 3, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>§. 3. But now suppose the Dean of <hi>Sarum</hi> had not only permitted, but perswaded Mr. <hi>Yeats</hi> and the Magistrates of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto the King for a Prebend of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and to plead, that the Supremacy of Right to give Prebends is in the King, from whose Original Right, the Bishops Right to give them is but derivative, (and therefore only a good and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right, because derived from the Crown,) he had not abjured the doing of it, but rather had owned it with Ambition. The only Reason why he denies it, is because it is a Lye; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is a lover of Truth and Justice; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he will not willingly fully the Merit of his Obedience to the very express Commands of the Lords Commissioners; who finding him averse from his being a Voluntier, were therefore pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to press him for his Majesties Service, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had not been else employed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:63880:50"/>§. 4. In compliance with the said Order and peremptory Command of the Lords Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, (to which no Churchman could refuse to pay Obedience,) the Dean of <hi>Sarum</hi> drew up a <hi>Narrative</hi> of <hi>Matters of Fact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which he had found in Old Registers; wherein he took occasion to censure Mr. <hi>Yeats,</hi> §. 9. and to assert the Lord Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi>'s Right to dispose of Dignities, Sub-Dignities and Prebends at large, §. 10. as well as the Right of the Dean singly, together with the Rights of Dean and Chapter in conjunction. And all upon the same principle or ground, on which he humbly did conceive the several Rights were all held: He did conceive, that all Rights are either <hi>Subordinate</hi> or <hi>Supream:</hi> He thought it dangerous to assert the Subjects Rights to be <hi>Supream,</hi> and therefore called them <hi>Subordinate:</hi> And lastly, He thought their Rights the <hi>Firmer,</hi> for being derived from, and depending on, and standing upon so <hi>sure a Bottom</hi> as the <hi>Supream.</hi> He shew'd what our Monarchs had done <hi>de facto</hi> in and over the Church of <hi>Sarum,</hi> which was not to reveal a Secret; for some of the Alienations of several Prebends, and one Archdeaconry, from that Church, are publickly written in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Gold on the several Stalls, and exposed to the Reading of all Mankind. But whether such Alienations were, or could be <hi>de Iure,</hi> the said Dean left humbly to the Consideration of his Superiors.</p>
               <p>What more or less could have been said to that purpose, by any of the Chapter, or by them All, or by my Lord Bishop himself, if either of them had been so commanded to speak his Knowledge, or his Sense, as the Dean of <hi>Sarum</hi> was, they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63880:51"/>
themselves can best tell; but the Dean of <hi>Sarum</hi> is yet to learn.</p>
               <p>§. 5. One thing is fit to be considered by those Pretenders to a suspicion of Persons more credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than themselves; which suspicion 'tis thought they have not, and cannot have in good earnest, against the Evidence and Conviction they have several times met with; if at least they have Faith and Charity, and do really believe there is a God, and a Devil, and Heaven and Hell. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that two of their Number shall be pretended to be suspected of two grand Crimes, the one of <hi>Simony,</hi> and the other of <hi>Incest;</hi> and that the Whispers of those Suspicions shall be disseminated and spread into publick Fame. Will not those Persons be glad to be allowed to prove the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive upon their Oaths? Will they not take it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ill, to get no more by their Vindication, than to have the Fame of <hi>Perjury,</hi> superadded to the suspicions both of Simony, and Incest? Will they not expostulate, <hi>si accusasse suffecerit, Quis erit Innocuus?</hi> Will they not probably break out into the Learned <hi>Diatribist</hi>'s Exclamation, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>! They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope to be believed upon their own single Oaths, who dare pretend not to believe honester Men upon their double ones. Besides that <hi>Simony</hi> and <hi>Incest</hi> will be accounted more scandalous, even by the Whigs in these worst of Times, than to be zealous for the King's Rights, or to obey the Lords Commissioners. And therefore, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venters of silly Jealousies and Lyes, shall at any time chance to suffer the heinous things which they have done, they will learn for the future to deal with their Neighbours and their Friends, as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63880:51"/>
they would that their Enemies should deal with Them.</p>
