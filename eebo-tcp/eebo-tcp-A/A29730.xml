            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe laſt time we were together, you told

my unkindneſs to <hi>Popery.</hi> To which he (or

not appear unkind to the perſons of <hi>Papiſts,</hi>
and that indifferency in judging is there

            <p>Now Sir though I know and very much
honour you, yet I am not acquainted with

How ever I here ſend it you; for I do really
look upon Proteſtancy (That of the Church
of <hi>England)</hi> to be ſo high a Bleſſing both
to the particular profeſſors of it, and to the
Country where it is embrac'd, that I could,
adventure very far in whatſoever ſhould

            <p>The paper may be ſhewn as you or your

it publiſhed in Print; tis not ſtudied enough

to two Heads, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crediblenes

and the grievouſneſs of the
Yoke impoſed on its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.
Of its incrdible
Doctrins. I name firſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the way of Nature this is not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called incredible, as abſurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible;
It makes the Body of Chriſt to
be in a Thouſand places at once. It makes
that Body wear its own quantity under
the dimenſions of a Wafer, <hi>that is,</hi> to have
its own bigneſs but to be never the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for it. It makes the accidents of Bread
and Wine Exiſt without a ſubject; <hi>that is,</hi>
there is whiteneſs and there is moiſture,
but there is nothing Either white or moiſt,
It makes the accidents of Bread and Wine
to nouriſh the Eaters and Drinkers of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>that is,</hi> to be turned into Subſtances. &amp;c.
To all which it is anſwerd <hi>that Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40099:4"/>
is ſufficient to overcome all theſe Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
Neither will I diſpute his Power
where his Will is revealed. But I ſay it is
incredible that Tranſubſtantiation in the
Euchariſt ſhould be the will of God. For
All other Miracles recorded in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures ſerv'd to ſome End. Elias
called fire from Heaven, <hi>to make it appear
that the Lord is God, and that he was his
ſervant</hi> So Chriſt raiſed up the widow's
ſon, <hi>for the comfort of the widow, and for
the manifeſtation of his own Power.</hi> But
Tranſubſtantiation ſerves to no End that
has been yet nam'd; It convices no body,
it profits no body. Our Saviour ſays ſo,
Jo: 6. <hi>the fleſh profits not.</hi> That is, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bodily Eaten. Chriſts fleſh profits by
being taken into God; by ſuffering upon
the Croſs, by being believed on; but by
being bodily Eaten, it has no effect either
upon the body; or the Soul of the cater. Not
upon the body, for that they confeſs is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
only in the accidents of the bread
and wine departed. Nor upon the Soul,
for that feeds on Chriſt only Spiritually,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40099:4"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> by Faith, Hope and Charity. Now is
it credible that God would worke ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miracles as are in the bowells of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi>
for no end in the World?</p>
            <p>2ly, The courſe of nature is certainly
the will of God; therefore we muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it is inverted, but where God himſelf
declares it is ſo. Here they ſay God has
declar'd for Tranſubſtantiation in theſe
words: <hi>This is my body</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, no
more then in theſe: <hi>that rock was Chriſt.</hi>
Or then in theſe of the ſame Apoſtle: <hi>We
are all one bread.</hi> For all three ſentences
are equally poſitive, and are equally the
word of God. Now, was the rock which
followed the Iſraelites in the wilderneſs
turned into the ſubſtance of Chriſt not
then born? Or are all Chriſtians turned
ſubſtantially into bread? No, all ſay, <hi>that
rock was Chriſt</hi> imports no more then <hi>that
rock was the repreſentative of Chriſt. We
are all one bread;</hi> that is, <hi>we are all repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by one bread;</hi> Why not then, <hi>this
is my body,</hi> that is, <hi>this is the repreſentative
of my body?</hi> If it be lawful to take one word
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40099:5"/>
of God figuratively, it cannot be wicked
to take another ſo, if the matter equally
requires. And certainly there can be no
greater neceſſity any where, than in the
Euchariſt of flying from Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to a figure.</p>
            <p>3ly. tis Incredible that the Apoſtles or
the Primitive Church ever thought of
Tranſubſtantiation; When our Saviour
ſaid <hi>I go to the Father,</hi> the Diſciples asked
what it was. When he told the <hi>Parable
of the Sower,</hi> they asked what it meant, If
they had thought of a change of ſubſtance
by the words of Conſecration, would they
not have ſaid: <hi>how can this be?</hi> do we not
ſee there as formerly? and the bread and
wine as formerly? But he had inſtructed
them Jo. 6. how <hi>his fleſh</hi> is <hi>meat indeed and
his blood drink indeed,</hi> to wit Spiritually
not bodily, therefore they boggl'd not.</p>
            <p>Again, not one Apoſtle nor one Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Doctor for above ſix hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chriſt either mentions this change of
ſubſtances, or (in all thoſe vaſt volumnes)
ſays one word that infers it. The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40099:5"/>
ſpoke not of it; neither did the Jews or
heathens object it; Yet Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the eye of an unbeliever is a maſſe
of contradictions.</p>
            <p>What work would <hi>Lucian</hi> have made
with it? But no ſuch matter is mentioned
by that ſcoffer, or by <hi>Porphyry,</hi> or <hi>Feſtus,</hi>
or <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In ſo incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a doctrine would <hi>Beringarius</hi> (above a
thouſand years after Chriſt) have been
the firſt Heritique? If Tranſubſtantiation
had been the ſetl'd doctrine of the Church
in the days of <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> would that
Emperour have writ to <hi>Bertram</hi> the Prieſt
for his opinion of the real Preſence? Would
<hi>Bertram</hi> have poſitively anſwered that <hi>the
hoſt is not the ſame body of Chriſt which was
born of the Virgin</hi> Mary? Only that body
of Chriſt which was born of the Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> is to be ador'd, therefore the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the hoſt was not in faſhion in <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trams</hi>
days.</p>
            <p>4ly. As there is nothing in the Holy
Scripture or ancient Fathers which can be
rationally brought in favour of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40099:6"/>
ſo there are in them very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſayings which ſeem incompatible with
it. Mat: 26. <hi>Me yee have not always.</hi>
Which was ſpoken becauſe of his Death
and Aſcenſion. Hear St. Auſtin upon it.
<hi>Non ſemper</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Not always according to his
bodily preſence, but as to his Majeſty, as to
his Providence, as to his inviſible Grace is
fulfilled that: Behold I am with you to the
end of the World.</hi> So Act. 3. 31. <hi>Whom
the Heavens muſt contain till the reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all things. Yes,</hi> ſay they, <hi>he is only in
Heaven locally, and in the Hoſt but ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
and not as in a place; his whole body
being in the leaſt part of the Hoſt if ſeparate
from the other parts.</hi> Which to St. Auſtin
I am ſure would have imported that Chriſt
is really in Heaven and not really in the
Sacrament; for he ſays upon Pſalm. 33.
<hi>Si ſpatia</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If ſpace of place be taken from
a body it is no where, that is, it is not.</hi> Does
this ſound as if he underſtood the quillets
of Tranſubſtantiation? Again to <hi>Boniface</hi>
ep. 25. <hi>Si Sacramenta</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If Sacraments
had not the likeneſs of the things whereof
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40099:6"/>
they are Sacraments, they would not be ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and becauſe of this likeneſs they often
take the names of the things themſelves;
As therefore the Sacrament of the body of
Chriſt is in ſome ſort the body of Chriſt, and
the Sacrament of the blood of Chriſt, is the
blood of Chriſt, ſo the Sacrament of faith is
faith. And againſt</hi> Adimantus <hi>the</hi> Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee:
<hi>Non dubitavit</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he doubted not to
ſay: this is my body when he gave the ſign of
his body.</hi> And upon Pſal, 3. <hi>mira eſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientia</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Wonderful is the patience of
Chriſt who entertained</hi> Judas <hi>at that ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
wherein he gave his diſciples the figure
of his body and his blood.</hi> And <hi>St.</hi> Ambroſe
de Sacramentis: <hi>Non iſte panis</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not that
bread which goes down into the belly, but
the bread of Eternal life which ſupports the
ſoul.</hi> Many ſuch other ſayings the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may find cited by old <hi>Bertram</hi> and of
late by all the Proteſtant writers; but not
a word like them is in any Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
authour ſince the Council of <hi>Lateran.</hi>
The ſtile of the Doctours is not altered for
nothing. And ſo much for Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.

Secondly, I name Purgatory for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
doctrin, Purgatory as maintained
in the Church of Rome is a priſon at the
edge of hell, where ſouls are deteined till
by ſuffering they ſatisfy for ſuch venial ſins
as they dyed under, or for mortal ſins for
which they had not perfectly done their
pennance. The pains differ from hell fire
only in being Temporary; and the ſouls
which ſuffer them are in high Charity, and
at the laſt gaſp were purg'd from all unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
affections; yet muſt they ly here and
fry for their paſt treſpaſſes, till the utmoſt
farthing be pay'd. And all their own cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
avails nothing towards their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but they are ordinarily ranſom'd
from long durance by the Charity of
their friends on earth layd out upon Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Pilgrimages <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And upon ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
whole ſholes are let out by the Popes
Indulgence.</p>
            <p>Now I ſay this is an incredible doctrine
in it ſelf, for, 1. the Chriſtian faith is that
Chriſt ſatisfied for the ſins of the World,
how then can ſouls ſuffer meerly for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40099:8"/>
ſatisfaction of the Divine Juſtice? Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in this World are our corrections,
but puniſhing when there can be no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
muſt be a meer wrecking of
vengeance, tis ſo in hell, and they ſay it is ſo
in Purgatory. 2. tis incredible that God
ſhould ſo horribly afflict thoſe Souls
which ſo entirely love him, and which
he ſo highly loves. 3. Tis incredible that
venial ſins which upon earth are purg'd
with an Ave, a Pater noſter, a thump on
the breſt, or ſprinkling of a little holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhould after death merit ſuch horrible
torments, and which for ought I can hear
may laſt many years. 4. If theſe ſins do
merit the great pains of Purgatory, then
'tis incredible that a Maſſe, or a pilgrimage
ſhould pay the debt. 5. If Purgatory be a
neceſſary and alſo an aſſured paſſage into
heaven, tis incredible that any fire there
can be a torment; for the way to bliſſe is
happy, In this world hope of ſalvation
made Martyrs endure tortures with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but that torture which brings with
it aſſurance is matter of triumph. 6. 'Tis
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40099:9"/>
incredible that ſouls ſhould be ſenſible of
bodily fire: who can imagin what a ſcorch'd
Soul is? or how fire can torment the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
or the Wil? And the ſeperated
ſoul has nothing in it beſides them two.
But to all this I am anſwered as I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Tranſubſtantiation, that God's power
is incomprehenſible, and his ways paſt
finding out. However, I ſay Purgatory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo Irrational in it ſelf has need to be
well pro'vd from abroad; I mean by Texts
of Scripture, and Expoſitions of ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
But there is not one Text in the
whole Bible applyed to this Purgatory till
after <hi>S. Auſtin.</hi> Nay tis impoſſible that
many of the Ancient Fathers ſhould hold
Purgatory as it is now held in the Church
of Rome; for they held that no Souls (at
leaſt very few of the moſt perfect) go to
Heaven till the day of Judgment; and that
in the interim they are kept in receptacles
without any pain but that of delay'd Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and that at the day of Judgement
they muſt all paſs through fire; Origen: in
<hi>Pſalm: 36. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ego arbitror</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As I think
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40099:9"/>
it is neceſſary for us all to come to that fire:
though one be a</hi> Paul <hi>or a</hi> Peter; <hi>Such a one
indeed ſhall be told: though thou goeſt through
the flame it ſhall not burn thee; But a ſinner
like me ſhall come to that fire like</hi> Peter <hi>or</hi>
Paul, <hi>but ſhall not go through it like them.</hi>
Ambroſ: in coment: Pſalterji: <hi>Igne nos</hi> &amp;c.
David <hi>ſays: thou haſt tryed us by fire, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhall all be tryed by fire: and if we
be not conſum'd yet we ſhall be ſcorch'd.</hi>
Lactant: 7 inſtit C. 1. <hi>Sed &amp; juſtos &amp;c.
When God Judgeth even the juſt, he will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min

is, at the End, By that fire is ſignified the
day of Judgment, ſeparating thoſe carnalls

            </p>
            <p>I take this labour to clear the Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
held by ſome of the ancient, becauſe their
ſayings and the Texts which they cite for
their Purgatory are all which they bring
now for the Purgatory maintain'd in the
Church of Rome; whereas tis impoſſible
that they who held the former Purgatory
ſhould hold this latter, for, 1. the former
Purgatory was in the judgment, this Latter
is immediatly after Death. 2. The former
Purgatory was for the amendment of the
perſon, this latter puniſhes for Sin when
the perſon is perfect. 3. The former Pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gatory

Pope would not lift up a Finger for <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
In fine, he that in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
holds no other <hi>Purgatory</hi> but that which the
fore-quoted Fathers held, will be declar'd
haeretical, of which <hi>Tho: White</hi> late an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Prieſt</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
See his book <hi>de medio animarum Statu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid: The ancient Fathers
holding one ſort of Purgatory, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holding another ſort,
how come we Proteſtants to hold none?
I anſwer: The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for throwing off the Purgatory main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by ſome of the Fathers; for ſhe had
thrown it off long before our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
We indeed threw off that Purgatory
which is maintained by the preſent Church
of Rome, as new and invented; which is
thus demonſtrated out of the foregoing
diſcourſe. The preſent Church of Rome
maintains a Purgatory abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with that which was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the ancient Fathers (as is proved
above); therefore the Purgatory of the
preſent Church of Rome came not by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40099:11"/>
from the Fathers, but was invented
by their children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Add to this St. Auſtin ad Dulcitium q.</hi> 1.
It is not incredible, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that ſuch a
thing ſhould be after this life, and inquiry
may be made whether it be ſo, and it may
be found out, and it may be hid, that ſome of
the faithful through a certain Purgatory
fire ſhould be ſav'd ſooner or later as they
did more or leſs love the good things that
periſh. <hi>He ſays</hi> Purgatory is not incredible
<hi>(that is, ſome ſort of Purgatory)</hi> that it
may be inquir'd after, and perhaps it may be
found, and perhaps not. <hi>A good while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him</hi> Gregory <hi>ſaid to</hi> Peter <hi>the Deacon,
that many things are now known of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſouls which were not known of old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Bede</hi> ſays that Purgatory became
known in <hi>England</hi> upon the miraculous
deliverance of a ſouldier from his bonds by
the ſacrifice of the Maſſe. In fine, the Greek
Church never own'd Purgatory, and yet
to them (as to goſpel matters) was <hi>declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the whole council of God.</hi> Act. 20. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſuppoſe Tranſubſtantiation and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40099:11"/>
are fictious, is the Errour Damnable?</hi>
I do not ſay whether it be or no; but I am
ſure that all errour is dangerous to the
ſoul, becauſe it is its blindneſs; and if the
blind lead the blind <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides, errour has
a ſpawn of conſequents in which the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is often more ſenſible than in the
<hi>damm.</hi> For inſtance, the opinion of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation
has (though not by good
conſequence to my reaſon) brough forth
a ſacrilegious detention of the Cup from
the Laity. Adoration of the Hoſt is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and a true birth of the ſame opinion;
and that has in it many ſymptomes of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.
<hi>But what ſoul-killing venom comes
from Purgatory?</hi> Why, tis a groſſe diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragment
of the paſſion of Chriſt which we
do accuſe of imperfection, while we think
it neceſſary to joyn our ownſufferings with
it for the ſatisfaction of the divine Juſtice.</p>
            <p>I have done with Tranſubſtantiation
and Purgatory, and need not name any
more of the incredible doctrins of Popery;
for this is one of their doctrins, that he
who denies one Article of the Faith, denies
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40099:12"/>
all; becauſe the propoſal of the Church is
the only reaſon of believing any. Out of
which I infer; that if they are baffl'd in any
one Article; they are undone as to all; for
their propoſal has loſt its infallibility.
Therefore in the next place, as the doctrins
of Popery are incredible and dangerous to
our condition in the world to come, ſo I
ſay the yoke of it is very grievous and the
burthen almoſt inſupportable in this
world. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Popery deprives us of ſeveral rights
of nature. It requires us to believe things
naturally abſurd, without giving us any
ſupernatural proof, as appears in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Tranſubſtantiation and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
and yet if we doubt, we are damn'd
to the fire of this world, and that of the
world to come. Agen, to make us pray
and praiſe God in an unknown tongue;
What is it but to rob us of the common
rights of humanity: Parrots and Pies learn
words, but to underſtand them is the
priviledge of mankind. And he that ſhould
worſhip God only by ſaying what he does
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40099:12"/>
not underſtand, were degenerate into a
beaſt as to his religion. St. Paul ſays <hi>if
in the Church they all ſpeak with tongues,</hi>
(though themſelves do underſtand them)
<hi>that a ſtranger coming in, will think them
mad.</hi> Is it not madder for them all to
ſpeak with tongues which they do not
underſtand? That Papiſt muſt be very
much ſtupifyed to whom this impoſition
is not grievous.</p>
            <p>2dly. Popery is a great Invader of our
Civil Rights. The Pope can excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
a King; and by ſo doing, his Subjects
are abſolv'd from their Oath of fidelity, and
are commanded to pay no Obedience; ſo
the Prince loſes his government, and the
people not only, loſe their Protection but
alſo are Embarras'd in inſoluble doubts of
conſcience, between the pretenſions of the
Pope and thoſe of the King. And this was
the Popiſh Doctrin long before the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
as appears in <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi>'s Summ.
Neither has the Pope ever been drawn to
declare againſt that Branch of his power;
though in ſeveral Provinces he might by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40099:13"/>
ſuch a declaration have delivered abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his people from very great troubles.
Nay the Pope diſpoſes of unforfeited King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
He gave away the Kingdoms of
<hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru;</hi> though thoſe Kings had
never been under his Juriſdiction, and S.
Paul ſays; <hi>what have we to do with them
that are without?</hi> But there is an inſtance
of this grievance about which I am more
concern'd. Our King <hi>John</hi> had troubles
from his Subjects to that height, that he
was fain to reſign up his Crown to the
Pope, and to receive it again from <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
his Legate, and to hold it thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
as from the Pope. This they ſay
and brag off, and upon this accompt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a Title to <hi>England</hi> at this day. Here
are ſeveral matters hard to be underſtood.
If the Pope was partner in the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
what can be more dangerous than
he to Soveraignty? If he was no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tner
in the Rebellion, how came he to
get the Crown by the Succeſs of the
Rebells? Again, if <hi>John</hi> was Perſecuted as
an Uſurper, why was not the Crown
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40099:13"/>
given to the right Heir? But nothing can
be more unpolitick than their pretending
a Title to <hi>England</hi> from this Tranſaction
with King <hi>John;</hi> for it intitles them to the
juſt Indignation of every King of <hi>England</hi>
and of all his good Subjects.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Popery is very grievous to
the private purſe &amp;c. conſequently
dwarfs any people that embraces it. Of
what boundies numbers are their Clergy
and Religious? <hi>The preſent ſtate of France</hi>
ſays that one third of that Kingdom is
theirs; and it muſt be worſe in <hi>Spain.</hi>
Then, their Pilgrimages, Ranſomes from
Purgatory, Offrings at ſhrines and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
are notable Pick-pockets. <hi>But
how do divifications work?</hi> Why the people
look upon a new Saint as a new Adovcate
for them in Heaven.</p>
            <p>But here it may be ſaid, that ſome of our
people think the Proteſtant Clergy (Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the Church of <hi>England)</hi> pretty
chargeable. I anſwer, that the means of
our Clergy is ſo ſmall a pittance in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of that which went away with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40099:14"/>
Popery, that they muſt be very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
who grutch it. And really I
never knew any maligne the decent main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of our Church but ſuch as diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
a great many other vices. In our
late confuſions, all that were againſt the
Church were againſt God and the King
and their fellow Subjects: they were ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
prophane, and yet Hypocrites in
contempt of all our ſenſes. But this is a
digreſſion. The truth is, Religion muſt
be in ſome degree Chargeable: for if we
will ſerve God only out of that which coſts
us nothing; then in our Eye the ſervice of
God is nothing worth. But there may be
too much taken as well as there may be
too little given.</p>
            <p>I might add other grievances: as the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
impoſing on the vulgar by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
to which no man of reaſon among
themſelves gives any credit. Then how
reſtles are their Bigotts in Plotts! But
they are told of that by Enough. We had
here a Barbarous Rebellion in the year
1641. I do not know whither the Pope
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40099:14"/>
rais'd it or no; but he own'd it, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
it, and hindred all expedients offer'd
for a cloſure of the Wound, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
of very many Gentlemen of that
party, who yet are ſo well natur'd as to
love his <hi>Holineſs</hi> never the leſs. Nay of
late Fanaticiſme thrives by Popery. The
Presbyterians ſay the Indulgence to
them and others was but to cover that
to the Papiſts; But I never believe it the
ſooner for their ſaying it. No I think the
Papiſts help'd the Fanatiques only by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiperiſtaſis.</hi>
The late Plot makes them
look ſo black, that the Ignorant people
run to thoſe Religions which pretend
to greateſt diſtance from Popery.</p>
            <p>I would now draw to a concluſion, but
that I find my work is not don againſt
Popery till I cleare Proteſtancy from ſome
dirt thrown on it, which I ſhall endeavour
to do as briefly as I have don the reſt.</p>
            <p>Ob: 1. <hi>Proteſtants generally yield that
a Papiſt may be ſav'd, how then came Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
from Popery to be neceſſary? why
ſhould the unity of the Church be broken
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40099:15"/>
for That without which we may be Eternally
happy?</hi> I anſwer, we condemne no man;
there is one that will judge the world,
and charity commands us to hope that
well meaning Papiſts will be ſav'd in that
day. But if any man thinks the Popiſh
doctrines falſe, and yet profeſſes them as
Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy
is a damnable ſin. Hence the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
became neceſſary. God open'd
the Eyes of ſeveral people: They ſaw
errours in the Church, refus'd to own
them, declar'd againſt them, and in ſome
Countries prevail'd againſt them. They
muſt either do ſo, or be Hypocrites in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
what they did not think. Not that
men are every where bound to proclaim
their Religion, but in the Church of
Rome they are. There they muſt profeſs
every thing with the Church, or ſuffer as
Hereticks. In Summe, the Church of
Rome kept the Chriſtian Faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we did not, neither might we leave
it becauſe of ſome erronious ſuperſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
not, for example ſake, becauſe they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40099:15"/>
believed Tranſubſtantiation and ador'd the
hoſt; but becauſe they compelled us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and to do ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob</hi> 2. If it be lawfull for Proteſtants to
reform from Popery for conſcience ſake;
then it is lawfull upon the ſame account for
Preſbyterians to reform from Proteſtants,
and for Independents, and for Anabaptiſts,
Quakers &amp;c. without end. And if this be
allowed, in what a perpetual toſs of troubles
will Chriſtian Countries be? One crying up
one way to Heaven, and another crying up
another way, and their words often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
to blows, each one party condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the reſt: but moſt of them joyning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Chief Magiſtrate? Beſides the
unity of the Church is gone, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints is gone, and the Church
will ſoon be gone; for diviſion is not many
ſteps before deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This objection goes a great way with
many people, therefore I will ſet down
my anſwer diſtinctly in branches.</p>
            <p>1. I confeſs that diviſions in the Church
do naturally tend to the deſtruction of it;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40099:16"/>
but of this Evil they only are guilty who
cauſe the diviſion. Now who caus'd our
departure from the Church of Rome,
we that were driven, or they who drove
us away? If it be ſaid: <hi>who drove you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?</hi>
I anſwer: They that made it mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
for us to ſtay. We muſt either hear our
Conſcience, or them, or the Word.</p>
            <p>2dly. Every man is bound to reform
himſelf according to his conſcience, <hi>that
is,</hi> he is bound not to profeſs that which
he does not believe, and not to do that
which he thinks is unlawfull. But though
every mans reaſon be his own guide;
yet no one mans reaſon is the guide of
other men (unleſs they make it ſo as in
the caſe of Magiſtracy &amp;c.) therefore
no particular perſon ought to preſs
the Reformation of other men, unles he be
authoriſed by God or man. Yet it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that private perſons may think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
bound in conſcience not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
themſelves but others alſo; to Preach
and perhaps fight up their own way. And
when this frenzy is prevalent, tis a great
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40099:16"/>
judgment from God both upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
poſſeſſ'd with it, and upon the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in which it happens. But the rule is, that
as they follow their own erronious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
in theſe pranks; ſo the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
is to follow his conſcience, which
is not to ſuffer them to do hurt to the
Church or State.</p>
            <p>3ly. I confeſs that our being ſubject to
troubles from Presbyterians <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility
in our Church; but tis common to
us with the Church of Rome; We are vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Sectaries, and they are vex'd with
the ſame Sectaries, and with us too.</p>
            <p>4ly. But I ſhal be told that the ſtrength of
the Objection is in this, That by our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
from Popery We gave a Precedent
inviting others to Reform from Us; To
this I ſay, that in our Reformation the King
and People were of a mind and Reform'd
according to order of Law; therefore Our
Reformation is no Precedent for the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
and violent Endeavours of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
&amp;c. Again, the Sectaries have not the
ſame neceſſity of Seperating from us as we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40099:17"/>
had for Separation from Rome; for we could
not ſtay there without declaring for <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi>
&amp;c. which we could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
but the Presbyterians, Anabaptiſts &amp;c.
may hold their own Opinions in our
Church without ever being enquir'd into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, nay if they are known to be of ſuch
Opinions, there is not the leaſt puniſhment
for it. So that our Reformation was of
Neceſſity, Their's of Wantonneſs. We are
no Precedent for them. To conclude upon
this Objection, I ſay human affairs cannot
but be ſubject to inconveniences; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt not reject any thing for an
adhering Inconvenience, unles its Oppoſite
be leſs Inconvenient. Let us then conſider
whether poſſible Troubles from Sectaries, or
the certain Intolerablenes of the Roman
Yoke upon our Conſciences, Lives, and
Fortunes be the greater Inconvenience.</p>
            <p>Ob. 3. At leaſt the Romiſh Religion, by
the power it has upon peoples Conſciences
ſeems apter than the Proteſtant to keep the
people in Obedience to a Catholick Prince,
and ſo ought to be cheriſh'd by ſuch
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40099:17"/>
Princes. I anſwer: Popery is not ſo good
at keeping Subjects quiet as it is at raiſing
tumults; witnes the French League a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a Roman Catholick King. Yes,
Popery has made many Rebellions where
no intereſt was concern'd but its own:
but where did it ever hinder a Rebellion
to which other intereſts invited? Did it
hinder the Barons Wars in <hi>England?</hi> Did it
hinder the Rebellion of almoſt all <hi>Spain</hi>
againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt? Did it hinder
<hi>Maſſanello</hi> in <hi>Naples?</hi> Did it hinder the
<hi>Suiſſ-Cantons</hi> from revolting from the
houſe of <hi>Auſtria?</hi> Papiſts have often Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell'd,
But we can ſay of the Proteſtants
(I mean the Church of <hi>England)</hi> that they
have never yet rebell'd, &amp; that if ever
they would Rebell; they would have done
it in the late times, when their Loyalty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with all the miſeries of an unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
War, of long penury, of Captivity,
of baniſhment, of ſhameful Deaths. But
they bore all theſe; and alſo deſpiſ'd <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells</hi>
many ſlattering invitations. Whereas
the Papiſts of England were then ſaid to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40099:18"/>
