            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

On the ſixt of this inſtant Moneth of <hi>September,</hi> here appeared a Spirit (for ſo I muſt call him) that tooke vpon him a humane ſhape, which calles himſelfe Prince <hi>Mammon,</hi> he ſeemes to bee about the age of fifty yeares, he weares his beard very long and ſquare cut, hee is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leane nor fat, great nor little, high nor low, the colour of his skinne is neyther white nor blacke, but is a man of a midling ſtature, and of a very cleare complexion.

The Horſes ſeemed like <hi>Turkish</hi> lennets, and were of ſuch a compoſure for colour, and ſhape ſo vndeſcriable for curioſity, that there was no imperfection to be found in them; becauſe, when ſo many excellencies meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they make a thing Supernatural. This Spirit thus humanized, rode through the City, in the State and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of an Embaſſadour, in a ſlow motion, till he came to a goodly Palace of the Earle <hi>Triuolehet,</hi> which is ſoitua<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

He can transforme his ſhape at his pleaſure, and day and night he trauaileth through this City: And when he viſits the Soke, he asketh them, whether they will be healed, and doe ſuch things as he ſhall require of them to doe: if they ſay they will, he heales them immediately, but if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, or ſticke at the motion, he ſtrikes them with a Rod that he hath in his hand, and the party ſo ſtrucke dyeth preſently, as it hath happened to many in this City. This being knowne to the State, they conſult with the Prelates; namely, the Cardinall and Biſhop of this Dioceſſe, and when the Senate of the Clergy had attempted all wayes, both Spirituall, and Temporall, that could be imagined, for the chaſing hence of this Fury, and could not doe it: at the laſt they concluded, that it was the will and pleaſure of the Almighty God, to permit and ſuffer him to be there; for this I know, that after they had ſent the Marſhall with 200 men, well furniſhed with Piſtols, and other munition to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

            <p>Before the execution of the aforeſayd <hi>Plateo</hi> and <hi>Mora,</hi> the complices had intended to vndermine the priſon, with a determination to haue blowne vp their infernall frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to preuent their diſcouery.

            <p>Alſo, before the execution of the aforeſayd, they were demanded by the Iuſtices and Churchmen, what preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue they had to defend themſelues from infection, and if they could make an Antidote againſt it. They anſwered that nothing could bee inuented of efficacy ſufficient to withſtand the opperation of that peſtiferous oyntment, and powder: for that it was made by direction of the Diuell.</p>

            <p>They haue asked licence of the Commiſſioners of the Inquiſition, to make a preſeruatiue for the City by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke Art,</hi> but was not granted.</p>
            <p>At a ſolemne Proceſſion which they made in <hi>Millaine</hi> with great Deuotion, thereby to appeaſe the wrath of God (as ſayth the originall) and that hee would vouchſafe to deliuer the City from ſo great a danger, the Delinquents ſtrowed their Peſtiferous powders about the ſtreets, ſo that there dyed vpon that occaſion aboue 10000 perſons.</p>
            <p>They haue brought to <hi>Millaine</hi> horſe-loades of theſe powders, and at the entry of the gates, and to paſſe them by the cuſtome houſe, they did enter them for gold wyer, and for ſuch paid they cuſtome, and paſt cleare.</p>
