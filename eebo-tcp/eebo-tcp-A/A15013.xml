         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath beene a commendable uſe in the Church of God from the Primitive times downe to us; that the lives of ſome or other (eſpecially of the more famous Miniſters and lights therein) have beene written by men who beſt knew, and had learned what their lives and converſation was. This they did not onely to vindicate their names from the ſlanders of the wicked, who will ſpeake evill of all that oppoſe their evill wayes, and alſo that the dead might bee duely honoured; but chiefly that the living by their good Examples might glorifie God for them and be edified.</p>
            <p>This writing and printing the lives of worthy men, is like the engravings with the point of a diamond, raiſing up for them an everlaſting monument; upon which the light of their Faith and good workes is made to ſhine before men, that ſeeing their Faith and holineſſe they may follow them; and may alſo praiſe God for his graces in them, and for the good which hath bin done by them, and ſo glorifie their Father which is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27208:7"/>I have beene earneſtly intreated to write the Life and Death of M. <hi>William Whately,</hi> late Paſtour of the Church of <hi>Banbury,</hi> I was made choice of the rather, becauſe of that intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Friendſhip which was betweeene us, and becauſe of our long acquaintance, being of the ſame time in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Vniverſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and of the ſame Colledge and Chamber and having the ſame Tutor; and afterward when wee were both placed in the Miniſtery wee lived ſometime together in one houſe,<note place="margin">By marriage of ſiſters.</note> and a great while neare one another, and were alſo nearly allyed</p>
            <p>I know none that had like meanes to know him more thoroughly then I. I have therefore not unwillingly ſet pen to paper, and doe here in all plaineneſſe and ſobriety of truth reckon up and report his life and death in a ſhort ſumme, that thoſe who will may read and make their uſe of it. For in many things hee may bee a lively patterne to us his Brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in the Miniſtery of the Goſpell of Chriſt; and the like in many things for the imitation of all that deſire to live godly in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>This M <hi>William Whately</hi> was borne at <hi>Banbury</hi> a burrough Town very well known in <hi>Oxfordſbure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">M. <hi>Thomas</hi> and Miſtres <hi>Ioyce Whately.</hi>
               </note>His Parents were both of them forward profeſſours of the Goſpell of Chriſt, and of the power of Godlineſſe and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, according as it is now mainetained in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> They were both of chiefe note and place in the Towne, his Father being oft Major, and a long time a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Iuſtice of Peace in that Burrough. His Mother was a rare woman for naturall parts; but chiefly for Piety, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in her Calling, Frugality and Mercifullneſſe to the poore. She was a right <hi>Lois</hi> or <hi>Eunice</hi> in breeding up this her Son (as ſhee did her other Children) in the Knowledge of the holy Scriptures from a child.</p>
            <p>His Parents trained him up in his yonger daies to learning, ſetti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g him to the beſt Schooles that were in thoſe parts, where he profited in learning (as alſo hee did in the Vniverſitie) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove moſt of his equalls in yeares. This hee did by reaſon of the Excellency of the naturall parts which God had given
<pb facs="tcp:27208:7"/>
him, namely, a quicke apprehenſion, a cleare judgement and a moſt happy memory.</p>
            <p>His ripeneſſe in Grammer learning in Latine, Greeke and Hebrew was ſo earely that about the fourteenth yeare of his age, he was ſent to Chriſts Colledge in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> where God provided him and me a <note n="*" place="margin">M <hi>Thomas Pot</hi>
               </note> Tutor, one of a thouſand for Pietie, Learning, Diligence in reading unto, and in a moſt loving and wiſe care of governing and godly inſtructing of his pupils.</p>
            <p>In the Vniverſity he was an hard Student and quickely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a good Logician and Philoſopher, a ſtrong diſputant, and an excellent Orator. He delighted much in the ſtudy of Poetry and the Mathematiks.</p>
            <p>Hee was a conſtant hearer of M. Doctor <hi>Chaderton</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> who at that time were famous Preachers in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</hi> And it was our Tutors manner to cauſe all his Pupills to come to Prayers into his Chamber every evening, and hee called all the under graduates to give account of what they had heard upon the Lords day, and when any of us were at a ſtand and <hi>non-plus,</hi> hee would ſay <hi>Whately,</hi> what ſay you? then hee would ſeldome faile, but repeate as readily, as if he had preached the Sermon himſelf. By this he did win our Tutors love, and our wonder at him; but (ſuch was our pride) he gained our envy of him</p>
            <p>His Father (whether becauſe he was not reſolved what cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to breed him to, or for what other cauſe I know not) after that hee had with credit proceeded Bachelour of Arts, hee took him home, where he abode ſome good time, yet applying himſelfe unto his ſtudies.</p>
            <p>While hee remained at home with his Father hee married the Daughter of one Maſter <hi>George Hunt,</hi> the ſonne of that tryed and prepared Martyr <hi>Iohn Hunt</hi> mentioned in the Book of Martyrs, who was condemned to be burnt for Religion, but was ſaved from the execution thereof by the death of Queene <hi>Mary.</hi> This Maſter <hi>George Hunt</hi> was bred up in the Famous f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee Schoole of the Marchant-Taylers in London, and afterward by the incouragement of Maſter D. <hi>Humfry</hi> (by
<pb facs="tcp:27208:8"/>
occaſion of a viſit of that Schoole) and by the furtherance of M <hi>George</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Kingſmells,</hi> and by the exhibitions of Biſhop <hi>Pilkinton</hi> (all which for their honour ſake I name) he was called unto, and mainetained in that worthy Foundation of good Learning, <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> till hee was Fellow of that Houſe, where hee continued till hee had borne the offices of Deane of Arts and Deane of Divinity. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the meanes of thoſe worthy Maſter <hi>Kingſmells,</hi> hee was preferred to the Church of <hi>Collingborn-ducis</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Wileſ.</hi> where for the ſpace of fifty and one yeares and five moneths he lived a ſound and conſtant Preacher of the Word, and was of an unblameable and holy life, even untill the oyle of his radicall moyſture was ſpent, and the candle of his life of it ſelfe went out, in a full and good old-age, after a long and joyous expectation, and longing for his bleſſed change, which was in the eighty and third yeare and fift moneth of his age.</p>
            <p>This Maſter <hi>George Hunt</hi> (after that by importunity hee had got this his ſonne in law to make tryall of his ability to preach) he overperſwaded him to intend the miniſtery. And thereupon he entred himſelfe into <hi>Edmund Hall</hi> in the famous Vniverſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and tooke his Degree of Maſter of Arts.</p>
            <p>Not long after hee entred into the Miniſtery, and hee was preſently called to be a Lecturer at <hi>Banbury</hi> which he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably performed above the ſpace of foure yeares, and then was called to be Vicar of the ſame Church, which office hee faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcharged neare thirty years till he died.</p>
            <p>The abilities wherewith God had indued him for his work of the Miniſtery were more then ordinary. For hee was of a quicke underſtanding, of a cleare and deepe Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of a moſt firme memory, and of a lively ſpirit. Hee was naturally eloquent, a maſter of his words, having words at will. Hee had a moſt able body and ſound lunges, and till ſome yeares before his death, he had a moſt ſtrong and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible voice. And according as his matter in hand, and his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory needed, he was both a terrible <hi>Boanerges,</hi> a ſonne of
<pb facs="tcp:27208:8"/>
Thunder, and alſo a <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a ſonne of ſweet conſolation. And which was the crowne of all, God gave him an heart to ſeek him and to aime at the ſaving of the ſoules of all that heard him. His ſpeech and preaching was not with entiſing words of mans wiſedome, but in demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power. He was an <hi>Apollos</hi> not onely eloquent, but withall mighty in the Scriptures. He like ſome of the Ancient Fathers was as occaſions fell out ſometimes an every dayes Preacher. He preached ordinarily in his owne Church twiſe each Lords-Day, and catechized for above halfe an houre before evening Prayer, examining and inſtructing the youth, and once a weeke he preached the ordinary Lecture.</p>
            <p>Hee was much againſt all ſuch preaching as was light, vaine, ſcenicall, impertinent, raw and indigeſted.</p>
            <p>His preaching was plaine, but as much according to the Scripture and alſo to the rules of Art, and of right Reaſon, as any that ever I heard or have heard of. In conference he hath told me what hee aimed at, and what uſe he made of the Arts, and what rules hee ſet to himſelfe in the ſtudying of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which was as followeth,</p>
            <p>That he might better underſtand his Text, hee made uſe of his Grammer learning in Greeke and Hebrew, in which tongues the Scripture is written. Alſo hee would uſe the helpe of <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> to diſcover to him what formes of ſpeech in his Text was to be taken in their primary and proper ſignification, and what was elegantly cloathed and wrapped up in tropes and figures that hee might unfold them, and ſee their naked mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Then well weighing and conſidering the context, hee would by the helpe of <hi>Logicke</hi> finde out the ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt in that Scripture. Hee would endeavour when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enter upon the preaching of any Chapter, to <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſe</hi> and take the Chapter into its ſeverall branches and parts. Then he would if it were a doctrinall Text, note the Doctrine as it lay in the Text and ſo proſecute it. Or if the Text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of illuſtrations or circumſtances of ſome principall truth there proſecuted; hee would then gather from ſome notable part or branch of his Text, an apt Doctrine, or Divine Truth
<pb facs="tcp:27208:9"/>
which ſhould ſo immediately follow, that the Truth obſerved in the Text ſhould be the argument or middle terme, wherby in a ſimple Sillogiſme, he could conclude his Doctrine. Next, hee would ſeeke for apt proofes out of Scripture to confirme it. Fewer or more as hee thought beſt, which done, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments according to Scripture and right Reaſon are forcible to convince and confirme reaſonable men in any truth, hee would find out Reaſons of his Doctrine, but he aimed that they ſhould bee ſtrong Arguments, or middle termes by which hee might likewiſe Sillogiſtially conclude his ſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>Then according to the nature of the Doctrine, and the need and aptneſſe of his Auditory; hee would as from an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequent of his Doctrine by way of Application, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme ſome profitable Truth, which yet by ſome might happily bee queſtioned, or elſe convince men of ſome errour, or reproove ſome vice, or exhort to ſome Dutie, or reſolve ſome doubt, or caſe of conſcience, or comfort ſuch as needed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. In all which ſorts of Applications hee did make uſe of more or fewer of them as there might bee cauſe, and hee would bee carefull that his Doctrine ſhould bee the Argument or middle terme whereby hee might ſillogiſtically conclude the maine Propoſition of any of his ſaid uſes: And if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe or exhortation did need preſſing home upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, then hee would ſtudy to enlarge his Speech, ſhewing motives to induce to ſuch a duty; and allſo diſſwaſives from ſuch a vice, taking his Arguments from dutie to God, decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or ſhamefullneſſe, pleaſure or paine, gaine or loſſe.</p>
            <p>And here again he would uſe the help of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> but all for the moſt part in a concealed way, without all affectation. And ſometimes he would ſhew the effectuall meanes of attaining of the Grace and power to performe the duty to which he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And ſometimes likewiſe he would ſhew the remedyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch or ſuch a vice from which he diſſwaded, as may bee ſeene by his Sermons already extant. Alſo when hee thought it was needefull to diſcuſſe and handle any common place or head of Divinity, hee would doe it very judiciouſly, fully and moſt profitably.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27208:9"/>Though hee had but an ordinary ſtudy of books for ſuch an accompliſht Divine, yet hee was one who had read very much. For hee would read moſt ſwiftly, yet not curſorily, for he could give an account of the ſubſtance and moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able particulars of what hee had ſo read.</p>
            <p>Hee had allſo allwayes when hee pleaſed the benefit of a Booke-ſellers ſhop, which cauſed him to forbeare to buy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bookes.</p>
            <p>Though hee preached ſo often, yet what hee preached was before well ſtudied and premeditated. Hee uſually did pen his Sermons at large; and if before he preached, hee had but ſo much time as to read over what he had written, and to gather it up into ſhort heades, hee was able if hee thought it fit to deliver it in publike well neare in the ſame words.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed God to put a ſeale to his Miniſtery in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, confirming and building up of many thouſand ſoules by his meanes in the whole courſe of his Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>Hee was a moſt diligent viſitor of the ſick people that were under his charge without reſpect of Perſons, after that it came to his knowledge that they were ſicke.</p>
            <p>He was a ready Peace-maker amongſt his flocke that ſhould happen to be at variance.</p>
            <p>He abounded in works of Mercie, hee was a truely liberall man, one that ſtudyed liberall things; for hee would ſeeke out to finde objects of his mercy, rather then to ſtay till they were offered. Hee did ſet apart and expended for the ſpace of many yeares for good uſes the tenth part of his yearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings in, both out of his temporall and eccleſiaſticall meanes of maintenance.</p>
            <p>Hee had an heavenly gift in Prayer, both for aptneſſe and Fullneſſe of Confeſſions, Petitions, Supplications, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions and Prayſes, as allſo for readineſſe and copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of apt words, together with Fervency of Spirit to poure them out unto God in the name of Chriſt in the behalfe of himſelfe, and of all thoſe who in Prayer joyned with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27208:10"/>He had this ſingular abilitie that in his Prayer after Sermon, he could collect into a ſhort Sum all which hee had delivered to his Hearers and make it the matter of his Prayer to God, to the end they might be inwardly taught of God, and become Beleevers and doers of what was taught them.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe when hee had read a <hi>Pſalme</hi> or <hi>Chapter</hi> in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, hee was ſo well ſeene in the Text, and of ſo good a Judgement, and of ſo choice a memory that though the <hi>Chapter</hi> was part of the <hi>Ceremoniall Law,</hi> or in the bookes of <hi>Numbers, Chronicles,</hi> and hardeſt Prophecies, he in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would diſcover the ſcope and meaning and chiefe notes of Obſervation, and their uſe, in ſuch ſort, that oft-times when I have heard him, I have much longed that I could call them all to minde; For I found the matter of his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be a better Commentary of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> with apt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and applications for uſe, then I could finde in any Authour that I had read, who had vvritten there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p>His manner was daily Morning and Evening to call his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily together, and to reade a <hi>Pſalme</hi> or <hi>Chapter</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to pray with them and oft to catechize them; beſides his conſtant Prayer Morning and Evening with his wife and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo conſtantly alone by himſelfe.</p>
            <p>He did ſet a part private dayes of Humiliation for his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon ſpeciall occaſions, and oft times before their prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their due receiving of the Lords-Supper. At which times he did exceed himſelfe in powring out his ſoule to GOD in moſt aboundant and moſt free Confeſſions of ſinne, and expreſſions of Sorrow for ſinne, with teares and with earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Petition for pardon and grace, and for the good of the Churches of God, but for our whole State and Church of <hi>England</hi> more ſpecially and particularly.</p>
            <p>He was much in dayes of private Faſting and humbling himſelfe before God alone, that hee might make and keepe his peace with God, and obtaine more Grace to keep more cloſe to him, and to walke more evenly with him, and that hee might the better keepe under his body, and bring it
<pb facs="tcp:27208:10"/>
into ſubjection (following the Example of the Apoſtle) leaſt having preached to others hee himſelfe ſhould not live anſwerable to his Doctrine without reproofe, knowing that Miniſters ought to be unreproveable. He was ſo much in this that it is thought by ſuch as knew him beſt that it impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the health of his body, though it made much for the good of his ſoule.</p>
            <p>He was very able and very ready to conferre with, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the doubts of thoſe many who in love and deſire of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation came unto him.</p>
            <p>He bare a tender love unto, and had a conſcionable care of that great people over which God had made him over-ſeer. For, although his mainetenance from them was but ſmall in compariſon, and unkindneſſes and diſcouragements many and his offers of greater preferment in the Church in reſpect of outward mainetenance were oft and importunate; yet he would not be perſwaded to leave them. Yea though once for reaſons which ſuddenly tooke him, he did promiſe to accept of another charge, yet within a while hee intreated mee to tell that Perſon to whom he had promiſed, that hee had better thought of it, and did deſire to be releaſed of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and that out of Conſideration of that great people which he ſhould leave, ſaying, that if he ſhould accept of that leſſer charge, when he ſhould come into the Church amongſt them his heart would in yerning towards his other people, aske him what he did there.</p>
            <p>He was duely inquiſitive after the affaires of Gods Church and people, and according as hee received true intelligence of their weale or woe, ſo hee had his ſympathies and Fellow-fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with them in either of their conditions</p>
            <p>Hee was much grieved and troubled when hee ſaw that difference of opinions, and thereupon ſtrangeneſſe, diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions and rends to ariſe and bee made in the Church amongſt Bretheren profeſſing for the maine, and in fundamentalls the ſame Truthes. Hee ſignified ſo much to mee with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling many times.</p>
            <p>Hee was judiciouſly charitable to any that ſhould differ in
<pb facs="tcp:27208:11"/>
ſome opinions from him, ſo long as he ſaw that they agreed with him in the maine and Fundamentall Points of Religion, and were diligent to enquire after the Truth, and ſaw allſo that they did indeed ſhew the Power of Godlineſſe in their lives. Hee could and did highly eſteeme them, love them, and converſe Chriſtianly and familiarly with them, and that becauſe (although hee thought they were in an errour, and hee would in private and publike endeavour to reclaime them) yet he was perſwaded that their deſire was to ſeeke Chriſt, and that they had an aime to know God aright, and to ſerve him in ſincerity.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this good which according to the truth hath beene ſaid of him; it muſt be remembred that hee was a man and not without his imperfections and frailties. For what man is he that liveth and ſinneth not. And as it is alſo ſaid, <hi>In many things we ſin all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is uſuall with God that men of the greateſt parts and gifts ſhould be exerciſed with ſome or other inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bee mortified, and ſome ſtrong temptations, to have ſome thorne in the fleſh, or ſome or other meſſenger of Satan (as the Apoſtle had) to buffet them: Elſe they would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above meaſure to the ſleighting, contemning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of their Bretheren, and other men would have too high an opinion of them, halfe deifying them, deſpiſing thoſe vvho are no leſſe holy, but not ſo excellently gifted as they.</p>
            <p>There was nothing which did more evidently diſcover truth of Gods grace in this man, then that which was occaſioned by his ſlips and ſtrong temptations; For theſe made him more watchfull over himſelfe, then otherwiſe hee would have bin; It made him more humble and more to loath his originall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and ſinfull nature, and bewailingly to cry out with the Apoſtle, <hi>O miſerable man that I am who ſhall deliver me from the body of this Death.</hi> And that becauſe hee was (as other the deare ſervants of God are) moſt ſenſible of the captivitie and bondage which ſin would ſtrive to hold him under, ſith that <hi>when he would doe well, evill was preſent with him,</hi> and made
<pb facs="tcp:27208:11"/>
him ſometimes to doe ſome things which in the bent of his ſoule he would not have done. This ſerved to make him more humble in himſelfe, more earneſt in prayer to God and more pittifull towards others in whom this ſinne remaineth and dwelleth (even after converſion) which (as the Apoſtle ſaith) is a weight and doth eaſily beſet them, to hinder them in their Chriſtian race. And this I am aſſured off, that hee would be the firſt eſpier of thoſe faults of his when the world could not nor did take notice of them, having no peace in himſelfe untill he had with all ſpeed and earneſtneſſe, ſought and regained par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and peace with God.</p>
            <p>He may be a patterne to all in receiving admonition from any that ſhould in love mind him of his fault. Hee was glad when any of the righteous ſmote him and would take it well, not from his Superiours onely, but from his equalls and farre inferiours. Hee had learned with <hi>David</hi> to bleſſe God that ſent them, and to bleſſe the advice, to follow it, and to bleſſe the party and thanke him that gave it. Hee would intreate ſuch, as hee hath done me in particular, not to be wanting to him in this Chriſtian office of Love; and hee would really ſhew more teſtimonies of his love to ſuch afterwards then ever formerly; which is a ſure argument of uprightneſſe. A moſt reverend Divine who had knowne him from his infancy, and had often converſed with him, gave teſtimony of him to this effect unto me and others when lately he ſpake of him by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the mentioning of his ſickneſſe.</p>
            <p>His latter daies were his beſt daies; for in the judgement of thoſe who could judge ſpiritually, hee grew exceedingly in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and in ſpirituall and heavenly mindedneſſe, his laſt works were his beſt works, arguing him to be of Gods grafting, and planted in the houſe of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, hee had a moſt happy and comfortable ſucceſſe of his conflicts againſt ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For a good while before his ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and death he did with Comfort and Joy make knowne to his deareſt friend that God had given him victory againſt his greateſt corruptions vvhich had for a long time kept him in continuall exerciſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27208:12"/>About eight weekes before his death a great fit of inward and ſhort coughing and extreame ſhortneſſe of breath did ceaſe upon him, in ſo much that thoſe who came about him fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that hee would preſently have departed. This fit bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, much weakeneſſe continued, yet hee preached di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times, untill that his encreaſing weakeneſſe did diſable him.</p>
            <p>In the time of his ſickeneſſe and weakeneſſe hee gave hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and wholeſome counſell to his people, neighbours and friends that came to viſit him: giving particular adviſe to his wife, children and ſervants reſpectively according to their place and condition as they oft came about him, thus hee did oft ſo long as hee was able to ſpeake unto them.</p>
            <p>His Chriſtian ſpeeches that concerned all, tended to this, that they would be carefull to redeeme the time, and to bee much in reading, hearing and meditating of the Word of God. That they would be much in Prayer, much in brotherly love and communion of the Saints. And that they would be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to hold faſt that which he had taught them out of the Word of Truth. And that while the light and meanes of Salvation was to be had, they ſhould not ſpare paines nor coſt to enjoy them. He was oft in his ſickeneſſe upon the painefull racke or torture of inward ſnatchings and convulſions, which ſometimes left him, but (three or foure dayes before his death) they returned and increaſed upon him; all which hee bare exceeding patiently. Hee was much in ejaculations and ſhort prayers and lifting up his heart to God in the behalfe of the Church and State, and for himſelfe allſo, which hee was moſt frequent and earneſt in, a little before his death. In the time when a brother of his (not onely in the common bonds of Chriſtianity, but allſo by alliance, and a brother in the Miniſtery) was praying with him and for him to this effect, that if his time was not determined or expired that God would be pleaſed to reſtore him for the good of his Church, or if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe that hee would put an end to his paine if he ſaw good; at the hearing thereof hee lift up his eyes ſtedfaſtly towards Heaven and allſo one of his hands (hee being not able to lift
<pb facs="tcp:27208:12"/>
up the other) and in the cloſe of that prayer gave up the ghoſt, ſhutting downe his eyes himſelfe, as if hee were fallen into a ſweet ſleepe. Hee lived much deſired and died much lamented.</p>
            <p>Thus a great, a good and mercifull man, a chariot and horſe-man of Iſraell is by Gods owne hand fallen and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the evill to come, and is entred into peace, and reſt in his bed of everlaſting pleaſures and joyes, enjoying the fruit of his Faith in Chriſt, and of his walking with God in upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Pretious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of the Saints though the wicked regard it not, but are glad of their abſence. But the living indeed they muſt, and they will lay it to heart, and will prepare and long for their owne diſſolution, that they maybe more immediately gathered to Chriſt the Iudge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting and waiting for a bleſſed Reſurrection of themſelves and of all that die in the Faith of our Lord Jeſus, to whom bee aſcribed all Might, Majeſtie, Dominion and Glorie, both now and for ever more, Amen.</p>
            <p>This Man of God and faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life upon Friday the 10. of <hi>May, Anno Domini,</hi> 1639. neare the end of the ſix and fiftieth yeare of his age.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S all other knowledges are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently taught by Precepts and Examples;<note place="margin">The Preface to the inſuing Treatiſe.</note> ſo is that beſt of knowledges, the art of living holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Hence it is that as I have inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted you to my poore ability in the Law and the precepts of good life, ſo I doe now intend to ſet before your eyes the Examples recorded in Scripture of Men, both good and bad, that by obſerving the ſwervings of the one, and the right walking of others, you may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter keepe your owne feete in the ſtreighteſt paths. Onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Examples, you muſt know this thing in generall; that no Example at all hath the force of a precept either to binde the conſciences of men to any thing as a duty, or to reſtraine from any thing as a ſinne:<note place="margin">Bare Examples binde not.</note> becauſe the knowledge of ſinne is from the Law, and where there is no Law there is no tranſgreſſion, and our care muſt be to walke in Gods waies, not in the waies of any man whatſoever. But Example prevaileth alone to perſwade the will as a fit argument of Exhortation or Dehortation, not as an argument to proove a thing needfull or ſinfull. Seeing then my
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27208:15"/>
duty is to perſwade you to all goodneſſe, and to diſſwade you from all evill, and the Examples of Scripture are undoubted and certaine, and they offer themſelves as it were unto the ſences, and ſo more worke on the will to allure or deterre: I thinke it a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent meanes of helping you in all righteouſneſſe and againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to make a collection of thoſe Examples of good or bad things which are left us upon record by a divine pen, and I will range theſe Examples according to the order of time wherein they lived, ſo farre as I can informe my ſelfe thereof by the Word of God. And I will begin with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and put them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe their good and evill was put togeher in practiſe thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Method obſerved in handling all the Examples.</note>The Method I intend to take in each perſon is this, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his Birth, Life and Death, and in his Life I will looke to his carriage and behaviour in reſpect of the deeds he did, good, bad, indifferent and doubtfull, and the things that befell him, either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly or adverſely, in benefits or afflictions.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> becauſe they were the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of mankind, and therefore could not be borne in the ſame manner as others be (for he that is borne muſt have a Parent, and he that hath a Parent was not the firſt man or woman, becauſe his Parent was before him) therefore I cannot tell you any thing of their Birth,<note place="margin">Nothing can be ſaid of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> Birth, but of their entring into the world.</note> but of their entring into the world by another way, which was to them the ſame in effect, that our begetting and birth is to us. I will informe you according to the Scriptures, for it much concernes us to underſtand our originall and to know certainely how mankinde came into the world. Know then in ſumme, That <hi>God made Man of the dust of the earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> 
               <hi>and breathed into him the breath of life and man became a living ſoule.</hi> Here is in briefe the Creation of <hi>Adam</hi> (now <hi>Adam</hi> ſignifieth red Earth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Adam</hi> what it ſignifieth.</note> becauſe his body was made of ſuch kinde of Earth) and concerning Woman it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that <hi>God cauſed a deepe ſleepe to fall upon</hi> Adam,<note place="margin">21, 22. verſes of the ſame Chapter.</note> 
               <hi>and then tooke one of his ribbes, cloſing the fleſh in ſteed of it, and framed it into the body of a Woman,</hi> in which alſo he placed a reaſonable ſoule.</p>
            <p>Concerning this Creation of Man, you muſt firſt informe your ſelves of the neceſſity of it.<note place="margin">The Creation of Man was neceſſary.</note> It muſt needs be granted by force of reaſon, that there muſt be ſome firſt man, ſeeing otherwiſe there muſt be infinite men,<note place="margin">There muſt be firſt Man, and why?</note> becauſe a number without beginning muſt be alſo without end, in as much as there is the ſame reaſon of both, that which cauſed men without beginning, did cauſe them neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore it muſt cauſe them for ever; now all reaſon agrees to this truth,<note place="margin">Non datur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum actu.</note> that there cannot be an infinite number, ſeeing to a number ſtill one at leaſt may be added. I meane it of actuall numbers and actuall infiniteneſſe, ſo wee reaſon thus, either an infinite number of men, or ſome firſt man and woman, not the former, therfore the latter. And if there muſt be a firſt man and woman, either they came by chance and without any maker, which is ſo abſurd, that no
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27208:15"/>
man can chooſe but hiſſe it out, or elſe they were made by ſome agent or matter that had a being before them; and if ſo, then either as Heathen Theologie tels, they grew out of the mudde as frogges doe in ſome Countries, or elſe were formed by God as our Theologie teacheth, and let every man that hath his right wits about him, judge in himſelfe whether of theſe twaine is more agreeable to reaſon, and more likely to be true. So man was created by God,<note place="margin">The time and matter of mans Creation.</note> now about his Creation, the time and matter of it is to be noted. For firſt man was not created till the ſixth day when a fit place for him to dwell in, and all neceſſary furniture for the place, and all needfull ſervants and attendants were before provided for his uſe. God ſaw it not fit to bring man into the world, before it was garniſhed and ſtored with all contents uſefull for him. And then man was made in the firſt place and woman after him, to ſhew that man is the ſuperiour in nature, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was made for man and not man for woman, therefore was man made firſt and woman after, and ſo doth the Apoſtle reaſon in two places where he handles the difference of Sexes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.8, 9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. So you have this cleared, how man came into the world, and how woman; but you muſt obſerve more particularly the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent matter of which they were made, and the parts of which they conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Man had a body and that was made of the duſt of the earth,<note place="margin">Why Man was made of the duſt. Gen. 2.7.</note> to teach him Humility, but he had alſo a ſoule and that was <hi>breathed into his noſtrils,</hi> that is, infuſed by God, wonderfully and immediately put into mans body, it is called a <hi>breath of life,</hi> and after <hi>a ſoule of life,</hi> that is, a ſoule which procured breathing and living, nothing is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for a man to conceive of then the nature of his owne ſoule next the nature of God and Angels, for the former is much more hard to comprehend, the latter equally difficult at leaſt, and it ſhould be unto us a matter of great abaſement that wee cannot tell what to make of our ſelves that is, of our ſoules, that it is we know by the effects it workes in the body and the abſence of theſe effects, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of contrary effects when it is departed from the body, and this is all we know in a manner, onely we may gather by diſcourſe that it is a ſubſtance incorporeall, becauſe it ſelfe doth informe the body, and one body cannot in reaſon be fit to informe another.</p>
            <p>The Scripture alſo tells us certainely that it is an immortall ſubſtance which muſt returne to God that gave it,<note place="margin">It is hard to underſtand the nature of the ſoule.</note> and reaſon ſubſcribes to this truth, becauſe finding the ſoule a thing ſimple, it cannot conceive how it ſhould be corrupted; O how ignorant are we and what cauſe have we to be puffed up with conceit of our knowledge, ſeeing ſo much blindneſſe doth now poſſeſſe our mindes, that in a manner all we have to ſay of our owne ſoules and ſpirits, the beſt part of us, is this, that we cannot tell what to ſay.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Evah</hi> ſhee alſo conſiſted of a body,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eves</hi> body was made of a rib, and why?</note> and that was made not of earth, but of a bone of her husband, to inſtruct her and him both of their duty, that ſhee ſhould acknowledge her ſubjection unto
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27208:16"/>
him as being taken out of him, and helpefull to him as being made of a rib an helpfull bone in his ſide, and to inſtruct him that he ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count her deare unto him and make precious reckoning of her, uſing her as in a manner his equall, as being a peece of himſelfe and extracted from his own ſide. Now a woman alſo hath a ſoule, an immortall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to make her a living and a reaſonable creature; for where ſin is found there is a reaſonable ſoule, becauſe none other is capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſequently tranſgreſſing a law made by God, but woman was in the Tranſgreſſion, that is, ſhee ſinned, and ſinned firſt before <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A fond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have no ſoules and the originall of it</note> therefore ſhee had a ſoule and a reaſonable ſoule, and they ſeeme to have beene wilfully blinde, that whether out of the ſilence of God in not mentioning the breathing of a ſoule into <hi>Evah,</hi> or upon what other mad conceit would needs make themſelves and others beleeve that women had no ſoules. I conceive it was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſome brutiſh and ſenſuall man, that by inſtilling this moſt abſurd conceit into that Sexe, would faine draw them to commit all licentiouſneſſe with boldneſſe, for if they have no ſoules it could be no fault in them more then in the bruit creatures to give over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all ſenſuality and libidinouſneſſe.

The firſt ſinne was the eating of the forbidden fruit; for you ſhall have it recorded that the Lord having placed <hi>Adam</hi> in a garden to dreſſe and keepe it, ſpake to him in this wiſe. <hi>Of all the trees of the garden thou maiſt eating eate,</hi> that is, thou maiſt lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with mine allowance eate, it was at his choice to eate of what kind he pleaſed, and if it ſeemed good unto him to forbeare eating of any he might forbeare, then followes a prohibition of one kind of fruit, <hi>viz. of the tree of knowledge of good and evill which is in the midſt of the garden thou maiſt not eate,</hi> that is, you ſhall not lawfully do it, in regard of naturall power he had ability to eate and not eate of that as of any other, but God did take away from him the morall liberty of eating of it, and by his authority ſaw good to abridge his liberty, and this alone to make it appeare to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he was an abſolute and a ſoveraigne Lord over him, and had full power and authority to forbid him what he ſaw good to forbid, and to command what he ſaw good to command. So the Lord did here call <hi>Adam</hi> to a profeſſion of his abſolute ſubjection to God his Maker, and of Gods abſolute right to himſelfe and all other creatures: and to this prohibition he ſubjoynes a threat of death, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt it thou ſhalt certainely die,</hi> in dying thou ſhalt die. Doubtleſſe the Lord meant this of both deaths naturall and ſpirituall, and it is to be interpreted, thou ſhalt become ſubject to a naturall and to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death, thy body and ſoule both ſhall be made in their kind mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Thy body ſubject to ſuch putrefaction and diſtemper as ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:27208:16"/>
cauſe it to be an unfit receptacle for the ſoule, and thy ſoule ſubject to ſuch ſinfullneſſe and diſtemper in its kind, as ſhall make it unfit to hold any fellowſhip with God, and ſo thy ſoule ſhall be ſeparated from thy body, and both from God the life of thy life; in this ſame phraſe is the wicked man threatened by the Prophet at Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. <hi>O wicked man thou ſhalt die the death,</hi> that is, <hi>moſt ſurely die and be damned.</hi> The Lord did not meane that naturall and eternall death ſhould inſtantly follow upon their eating, but obnoxiouſneſſe to both, and ſome degrees of both ſhould follow inſtantly, and at laſt the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of both, with an implicite exception of his grace in Chriſt in pardoning him. Lo now <hi>Adam</hi> had from Gods own mouth an expreſſe and plaine Commandement, wherein he was directly forbidden one and but one tree, with warrant for the uſe of all the reſt, and a plaine and expreſſe threat of death to begin to inſue immediately upon his eating. And this Commandement, either God himſelfe, or elſe <hi>Adam</hi> had made knowne to <hi>Evah,</hi> for you heare that ſhee doth both alleadge it and oppoſe it to the Serpents temptation at the firſt. Now this Commandement ſo plaine, ſo eaſie, ſo equall, that hee could not be ignorant of it, nor incurre any inconvenience by yeelding to it, nor picke any exception againſt it. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement which both of them knew full well did they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, and that very ſpeedily.<note place="margin">How long <hi>Adam</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued before he ſinned is not revealed.</note> How long they continued free from the ſinne, I know not, becauſe I find it not revealed and will not conjecture; becauſe the not revealing it by God makes mee thinke it is not to much purpoſe to know. If the firſt act of eating were that of the forbidden fruit, it is a great aggravation of their ſinne, that they tranſgreſſed Gods Law in a manner afore they did any other thing, if they ſtood any while it is a great aggravation, that after much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Gods bounty they would be bold to offend him, and taſte of the forbidden fruit after the feeling of the ſweetneſſe and goodneſſe of other fruits: but it was not long afore they did eate, and it was likewiſe done upon a poore motive, the temptation of a baſe Worme, and it was yeelded unto without much reſiſtance, for not many words paſſed them before <hi>Eve</hi> had condeſcended. You have the Storie of this ſinne in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where is firſt the Tempter, a Serpent, the moſt <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>naked</hi> or <hi>ſubtileſt</hi> of all beaſts; then the temptation in the matter of it and the ſucceſſe. The matter, <hi>The Serpent ſaid to the Woman, hath God indeed ſaid, you ſhall not eate of every tree of the garden,</hi> in which hee would make <hi>Eve</hi> either doubt of Gods Commandement, or elſe be diſcontent with it, as if hee had dealt niggardly with them in not permitting them to eate of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tree, or as if the forbidding of this were as much as if hee had prohibited them all the trees, intimating that this was as good as all the reſt, and the not giving them this as much as the deniall of all the reſt. Then the Womans anſwer, telling him that he had allowed them all the reſt and forbidden this alone, and that on paine of death; then the Serpents reply, in which he contradicteth Gods
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27208:17"/>
threat, that the Woman might not give credit unto it, for he tells <hi>Evah,</hi> that they ſhould nor certainely die, yea not onely ſo, but that God knew well enough how eating of that tree would procure to them an increaſe of knowledge, then the ſucceſſe of the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, that ſhee beleeving the Serpent and conceiving that ſhee ſhould gaine knowledge by the eating and conſidering the beauty and pleaſantneſſe of the fruit, did not alone eate of it her ſelfe, but alſo gave her husband, perſwading him alſo to feed of it, which he at her perſwaſion did.</p>
            <p>Thus was the firſt Commandement utterly tranſgreſſed, which ſo ſoone as it was done they began to have ſence of their nakedneſſe, and ſewed figleaves together to make them aprons for the covering of their nakedneſſe, which now began to appeare ſhamefull unto them.</p>

            <p>Now conſider we the benefits God had beſtowed upon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their fall, the making of them after his owne Image, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, with a moſt beautifull,

ſtrong, ſwift, healthie and comely body, free from all danger of ſickneſſe, death, or other miſery; giving them dominion over all creatures, planting ſo excellent a place for them as Paradiſe, and granting them the uſe of all the trees, and that of life, and putting on them ſo pleaſant a ſervice as that of dreſſing and keeping the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, beſides the hope and aſſurance of Eternall life upon condition of their obedience, of which Paradiſe it ſelfe and the tree of life were ſignes unto them. For if wee ſhould live the life of glory by obeying the Law, ſo ſhould they have done ſeeing they alſo were under the ſame Covenant of workes that we be under.</p>
            <p>Now after their ſinne God beſtowed divers benefits on them.<note place="margin">2.

            <p>The miſeries they felt were pronouncing a curſe upon them,<note place="margin">Their Croſſes.</note> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging them to an inavoidable neceſſity of naturall death, to much ſorrow in their life, he by tilling the ground (which ſhould bring forth ill things to him) and that with ſweat and labour, and ſhee by bearing children in ſorrow, and by being compelled by ſubjection to her husband; then by caſting them out of Paradiſe, debarring them the tree of life, and giving <hi>Caine</hi> over to kill his Brother bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then himſelfe, which muſt needs be an heavie croſſe to them, which God did ſomewhat mitigate by giving them another godly ſonne, even <hi>Seth.</hi> This is their life, their death followes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> lived 900. yeares, and for <hi>Eves</hi> death,<note place="margin">Their Death.</note> it is not mentioned how long ſhee lived,<note place="margin">Why the length of any Womans life except <hi>Sarahs</hi> is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture.</note> for God hath not thought it fit to tell us the length of the life of any woman except <hi>Sarah</hi> in Scripture: upon what conſideration it is hard to gueſſe, but ſure it is to humble wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mankinde, that becauſe they were firſt in bringing in death, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to have the continuance of their lives, recorded by Gods pen.

            <p>Firſt from their Creation,<note place="margin">The uſes of the whole.</note> and the benefits beſtowed upon them in and after their Creation; let us learne to acknowledge God to be our Creator, the Fountaine of our being, and to ſubmit our ſelves who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him in all things, ſeeing we have received our being from him; for in making them he made us in them, and whatſoever benefits he gave him in Creation, he gave them to us in him,<note place="margin">Omnes nos era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ille unus.</note> ſeeing if he had not caſt them away we ſhould not have wanted them.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:27208:18"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> forfeited it; for his naughtineſſe in ſinning cannot dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the goodneſſe of God in granting to him and his ſo great a heape of pleaſures here with certainty of Eternall life after. Doe you not ſee that God made us all to happineſſe and life in our firſt Parents, fitting all things, ſo that he might have ſtood and delivered over all thoſe benefits unto us. Let us not murmure againſt God for the puniſhment juſtly inflicted upon us in them and on them for the ſinne committed by them; eſpecially wee muſt praiſe God for the promiſe of the ſeed of the Woman which now God hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to us, by whom ſalvation and life was offered and tendered to all, ſo that by the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> all might have received happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as they loſt it by the firſt, if the fault had not beene and were not meerely in themſelves, that have beene and are careleſſe of Gods goodneſſe neglecting to conſider of his mercy, to beleeve in him and to turne to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne let us all ſee our owne ſinfullneſſe, and our mortality and miſery in his miſery,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> 
               <hi>For by one man ſinne came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and by ſinne death, and ſo death paſſed over all.</hi> This ſinne is our ſinne after a ſort, we muſt lament it and bewaile it, and be humbled for it, and in the ſence of our wretchedneſſe runne to the promiſed ſeed to deliver us from ſinne and death, and to repaire the Image of God in us by the mighty worke of his Spirit, which is as eaſie for him to doe as to create us juſt at the firſt, and which he will as certainely performe for us if we ſeeke it as hee did then in our firſt making.</p>
            <p>Againe, let us learne to hate and loath ſinne and Satan, not to hearken to his ſuggeſtions, but to beleeve Gods threats and ſubmit to his Commandements, let the husband reſolve not to obey the voice of his wife againſt God, let the wife take heed of drawing her husband to ſinne, let the husband rather reforme her then be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by her. O beware of thinking to get any thing by doing wickedneſſe, diſobedience will bring nothing in concluſion but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and unhappineſſe.</p>
            <p>Let us take heed of flying from God and of excuſing our faults and caſting the blame upon others, chiefely upon God himſelfe, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, but let us rather confeſſe, lament, and truſt in his mercy, and implore it, then dawbe and diſſemble, and thinke to eſcape by fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous ſhifts and extenuations;<note place="margin">We ſhould not bee proud of apparell.</note> and eſpecially learne not to be proud of apparell which is no better then a badge of our wicked rebellion and of our ſhamefull nakedneſſe. Let us be the better for the things we know concerning <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> our firſt Parents.</p>
            <p>Againe, let us be carefull to follow them in all good deeds which they did; O let us repent and beleeve in Chriſt hoping for life by him according to the Covenant of grace, as they did when they had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Covenant of Workes. For by truſting in Chriſt we ſhall goe to Heaven in the way of Evangelicall obedience, ſtanding in a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and indeavour not to ſinne, and a carefull humbling our ſelves and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27208:18"/>
ſeeking pardon when we faile, as ſure as they or we ſhould have done in the way of Legall obedience, if they and we had remained innocent; and God will as ſurely inable us to this Evangelicall obedience, if we ſeeke to him for grace and the renewing of his Image in us, as hee had inabled him to Legall and exact obedience. In truth Chriſt hath made the way to life eternall as eaſie to us in the path of the Goſpell, as it was to him in the path of the Law, for wee have grace to keepe us from loving and ſervnig ſinne as ſure as hee had power to abſtaine from committing ſinne. Say to your ſelves, <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne ſhall not damne mee, if in ſence of the miſery which it brought upon me I can fully ſeeke to Chriſt the promiſed ſeed.</p>
            <p>Further, let us follow him and her in that was good in both. How did <hi>Adam</hi> accept his wife, ſaying, <hi>This is fleſh of my fleſh,</hi> and <hi>ſhee ſhall be called</hi> Evah, and <hi>a man ſhall forſake Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and cleave to his wife;</hi> O you husbands love your wives as your owne fleſh, cleave to them above all, and forſaking all other, keepe you onely to them. You wives be content to be ſubject to your husbands, as it is ſure <hi>Evah</hi> was before her fall at leaſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable after too, for we reade of no braules betwixt them. O joyne together to bring up your children well, firſt in ſome honeſt calling, then in the knowledge of the true God and care of worſhipping him. I ſay teach your ſonnes and daughters things neceſſary for their profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and holy living in the world; bring them not up in idleneſſe and ignorance, but ſo carry your ſelves to them, that it may not be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you if they prove wicked, and be thankfull to God for your children, and learne to rejoyce, eſpecially in their goodneſſe, as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah</hi> did in <hi>Seths.</hi> Learne of your firſt Parents to be good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and follow all the things that were good and commendable in them.</p>
            <p>Againe, from their afflictions, learne to prepare for afflictions, and to make a good uſe of them when they come, if you thinke to live in this world without briers and thornes, without ſweat and labour you are much deceived. Croſſes are aſſigned to us as juſt chaſtiſements for our ſinne; we muſt to duſt, let us expect miſery and death, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make our ſelves fit for croſſes. It was Gods great goodneſſe that he would not ſuffer <hi>Adam</hi> to remaine in Paradiſe and to joy the tree of life. For had hee lived in ſo much pleaſure as that place would have affoorded, and had he found all the creatures as good and comfortable to him now after his fall when his nature was made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as when it was ſinleſſe, O how greatly would his ſin have growne through the fatneſſe of that over delightfull eſtate, even as weedes doe in a rich and unmanured ſoyle. Sure had not God ſent a curſe on the earth, and inflicted griefe and miſery upon man, hee would never have repented, never have conceived of his ſpirituall miſery, never have turned to God and ſought God; ſo that as it is a mercy in the Phyſitian to make the patient ſicke with a medicine, ſo it was in God to ſend theſe afflictions on us. Let us not therefore flatter our ſelves
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:27208:19"/>
in vaine conceits of living merrily, but let us prepare for afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which all muſt in ſome degree meete withall in their ſeverall callings. It was the voice of an Epicure in the rich man, that ſaid, <hi>eate and drinke and take thine eaſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ede, bide, lude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> we ſhould ſay to our ſelves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſinne hath made mee ſubject to divers croſſes, and I will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to receive them patiently from Gods Almighty hand, if he thinke it fit to exerciſe me with them.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially you that are Parents of children, looke for croſſes in your children; thinke this boy may proove not an <hi>Abel,</hi> not a <hi>Seth,</hi> but a <hi>Caine,</hi> a wicked and a ſinfull <hi>Caine,</hi> a hater of goodneſſe, and fugitive from God. Let mee take heed therefore that I doe not over-love him, that I doe not cocker him, and as it were marre and kill his ſoule by over-cheriſhing his body. If wee finde our ſelves apt to over-prize and over-love our children, wee muſt moderate thoſe paſſions by ſuch meditations, and if we finde our ſelves apt to over-grieve for their death, wee muſt tell our ſelves, Ah might not their lives have prooved much more bitter to mee then their death can; who would not rather bury a ſonne young then live to ſee him proove a <hi>Cain,</hi> and who can tell but his ſonne for whoſe death he takes on with ſo much exceſſive ſorrow, may not fall out to be as wicked as <hi>Caine.</hi> If any ſay I hope not ſo, I anſwer him, where be the grounds of his hope? did not our firſt Parents hope as much thinke you? Sure <hi>Evah</hi> giving <hi>Caine</hi> a name ſhewed that ſhee had good hopes of him when he was borne, yea thoſe that have good and godly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt prepare to be croſſed in their afflictions. Haſt thou an <hi>Abel,</hi> a godly child, O make thine heart ready to heare that ſome wicked hand hath knockt him on the head, perhaps his owne Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſome violent death hath ſeized upon him and taken him away before his time, and labour to be willing to yeeld to Gods hand if he will ſo croſſe thee, for why ſhouldſt not thou ſtoope to as heavie a burden as that which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did beare in the beginning of the world. For the death of good children, yea their miſerable and untimely death, and for the wickedneſſe, yea the notorious and unnaturall wickedneſſe of other children, let every man prepare himſelfe, by looking upon the example of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> that ſuffered theſe croſſes, yea let every godly man learne to prepare for perſecution from all <hi>Caines,</hi> but that wee ſhall treat on when we come to <hi>Abels</hi> example.</p>
            <p>But Brethren we muſt not onely prepare for croſſes of this kinde, but we muſt alſo make a good uſe of them when they come, that is, wee muſt turne them into medicines as Phyſitions doe ſome poyſons, cauſing the ſorrow which they will worke in us to become a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine againſt our ſinnes of which they be the proper and naturall effects. When you meete with croſſes and calamities, ſay, now I ſee Gods Juſtice and Gods Truth, now I ſee the hatefullneſſe and hurtfullneſſe of ſinne, and therefore now I will mourne, not becauſe I am croſſed, but becauſe I have deſerved this croſſe, and a worſe too, and ſo frame
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:27208:19"/>
to confeſſe and bemoane the ſinne, and to ſupplicate for pardon and helpe at the hand of God in the name of Chriſt, eſpecially looke to thoſe ſinnes to which your croſſes have ſome reference and reſpect. Are you croſſed in your goods, thinke if you did not over-love them and get them unjuſtly, or if in your children, ſee if you did not over-love them and cocker them, and ſo in all things of like kinde. In what God ſmites you, ſee if you have not in that ſinned againſt him, and ſo frame to lament your ſinnes and to ſeeke helpe againſt them. This will helpe to make your croſſe eaſie and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remove it, this will cauſe that you ſhall be gainers even by croſſes. When wee ſee the ill deſervings of ſinne and the perfect righteouſneſſe, yea the goodneſſe of God in calling thus to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; happy are they that be ſo afflicted and ſo taught in Gods waies.</p>
            <p>And Brethren let mee yet make one uſe of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> great ſinne, to warne you, that you take heed of preſuming of your owne ſtrength, and of boaſting that you will never commit ſuch and ſuch a ſinne, for if theſe two in their innocency could not eſcape when they neglected to ſue to God for ſtrength, O how much more ſhall not we ſtand if we adventure to bragg and boaſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe much of our ſelves, but when ſinne begins to gather upon you, and Satan to tempt, then flie to prayers and to requeſts, and to the threats and Commandements, and apply thoſe threats, and pray God to inable you to keep the Commandements, then ſhall you doe ſo well as you can wiſh, elſe large promiſes will bring forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſorry performances. Thus ſhould <hi>Eve</hi> have done, and then ſhee ſhould have had her prayers granted, and her faith ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and eſcaped the fault. And as I thinke the firſt of all the faults of <hi>Evah</hi> was,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eves</hi> firſt fault.</note> that ſhee was led away by the wary ſpeeches of the Serpent (by which he ſought by ſtep and ſtep to deſcend to this ſolicitation,) that then ſhee did not revive in her mind the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Gods preſence, and of her dependance upon him, and of his readineſſe to give her helpe on her ſeeking it, and of her owne imbecillity as being a creature, to ſtand without continuall ſupport from him. For ſure the Morrall Law lay upon <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah</hi> as well as upon us, and they ought thus to have behaved themſelves in temptation; here therefore I ſay was her firſt failing. For we muſt not thinke that there was no ſinne precedent to the actuall eating of the forbidden fruit, yea her being enticed and drawne away to diſtruſt Gods Truth, to deny his threats, to affect knowledge againſt Gods allowance, and to be bold to ſinne, when ſhee conceived that no danger would grow from it but much bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: all theſe were faults and preparations to the great actuall fault. Indeed it is probable, that if ſhee had taken her ſelfe in theſe ſlips, and ſet her ſelfe and graces on worke to have reſiſted them before they had come to ſuch an head, that then ſhee ſhould not have beene corrupted by them, ſo as to fall into ſinfullneſſe and mortality,

becauſe the Lord had limited the threat of death to actuall eating: but howſoever theſe things were faults in <hi>Eve,</hi> and now wee muſt learne therefore not to preſume any thing of our ſelves, but to confeſſe that if wee doe not ſeeke to God for his ſuſtentation and ſo obtaine the ſame from him, we ſhall ſurely be overcome to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſinne though never ſo grievous.</p>
            <p>But againe, wee muſt be incouraged to repent of ſinne and to crave pardon of it, any greatneſſe of it notwithſtanding, for even this ſinne of our firſt Parents is to them pardoned. This firſt and grand ſinne,<note place="margin">The greatneſſe of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſinne.</note> the ſinne of ſinnes, that did inwrap in it all the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Idolatries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all after-times, and was as I may ſo ſpeake in power all ſinne, even this ſinne is forgiven; <hi>Adam</hi> which caſt all into ſinne, out of Paradiſe, and out of Heaven what in him lay, even this <hi>Adam</hi> is in Heaven himſelfe, yea <hi>Eve</hi> that drew <hi>Adam</hi> to it, and perſwaded her husband to the committing of ſo monſtrous a Treſpaſſe, to the poyſoning of him and all his; ſhee is pardoned, ſhee is in Heaven. As God ſet forth the riches of his Mercy in pardoning ſo vile and capitall a ſinner as <hi>Paul</hi> was, that in him he might ſhew an example of all long-ſuffering; ſo hath he ſet forth the abundance of his Grace in Chriſt by remitting the fault, and ſaving the ſoules of theſe and theſe ſinners, which did not what they did in falſe zeale as <hi>Paul,</hi> but in wilfull unbeleefe and rebellion. Wherefore let no man doubt of obtaining pardon by the grace of God in Chriſt, becauſe of the greatneſſe of his ſin. For <hi>if by the offence of one many be dead,</hi> much more <hi>ſhall the grace of gift, and the gift by grace abound unto mercy;</hi> and <hi>if in</hi> Adam <hi>all die,</hi> that is, be made ſubject to death, <hi>ſo in Chriſt</hi> much more <hi>ſhall all be made alive,</hi> if they truſt in him and turne, if <hi>death raigned by the firſt Adam,</hi> much more <hi>ſhall grace raigne by the ſecond Adam;</hi> If, <hi>by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners,</hi> much more <hi>by one mans obedience ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> It is an extreame diſ-valuing of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and under-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Gods mercies in Chriſt, if any greatneſſe of ſinne hinder us from ſeeking to God for pardon and truſting to finde it. If we ſhould be appointed to deſerve remiſſion of our owne ſinnes every man for himſelfe, then a man might hope to get out of little ſinnes but not out of great, and ſo greatneſſe of ſinne might diſhearten him: but ſeeing it is Chriſt the Sonne of God as well as Man, that hath ſatisfied at once for the ſinnes of all, by being a Propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole world, now it is too too great a weakeneſſe, and too too palpable an ignorance of Chriſt and diſparagement to him, to doubt of pardon, becauſe of the greatneſſe of ſinne, and that wee may aſſure our ſelves, loe <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſaved, a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that let in the floud-gares to all ſinne, and that in committing ſo great a diſobedience, did commit at once all the ſinnes of all the world. There cannot be thought any offence greater, for the time, place, perſons ſinning, occaſions of ſinning, helpes againſt ſinne,

Commandement tranſgreſſed, no nor the matter of the ſinne nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For though the thing materially conſidered were but eating an apple, a plum, or whatſoever fruit it might be, yet that apple was as it were a Sacrament, a viſible profeſſion of their care to forbeare all ſinne by forbearing it, and ſo the taking of that was a worſe ſinne then if it had beene very actuall adultery or murder, as if a man ſhould take the Sacramentall bread and give it to a dogg, or caſt it into the fire, or trample it under feet knowing it to be the Sacrament, ſure he were as vile and farre more vile an offender, then if he ſhould lie in waite at his neighbours doore to defloure his wife, or to murder himſelfe or any of his houſehold. Now therefore take heart to runne to God penitently for pardon in Chriſt, and be ſure of ſucceſſe. And if greatneſſe and multitude of ſin offer it ſelfe to diſcourage you and to dampe your hopes, referre your ſelves to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and ſay, their one ſinne was more in badneſſe then all my ſinnes, and yet they were pardoned upon their repentance, and ſo ſhall I, and then even violently breaking thorough all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, give over thy ſelfe to ſorowfull confeſſions and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and thou ſhalt be pardoned.</p>
            <p>If any ſay my ſinne was worſe then <hi>Adams,</hi> for I have ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt; I anſwer, if thou haſt ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, repent and thou ſhalt be pardoned, for the cauſe why that ſinne cannot be forgiven, is not want of mercy in God or merits in Chriſt, but ſuch abundance of hardneſſe in them, that they will not ſeeke to God for pardon or for grace to repent. Wherefore I ſay againe looke on thy firſt Parents, that how bad ſoever thou beeſt were cauſes of thy being ſo bad, and promiſe thy ſelfe pardon upon repentance, becauſe they are pardoned, and hope to be penitent if thou indeavour and ſeeke it, becauſe they were helped which were as vile ſinners as thy ſelfe.</p>

In his carriage ſome things are for mattrer good, ſome things altogether evill. That which is good is, that at his Fathers appointment and education he betook himſelfe to a needfull trade of life, for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Caine was a tiller of the ground,</hi> that is, he gave himſelfe to Husbandry. This cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as it is very uſefull, for even the King is ſerved by the land that is tilled, ſo it is you ſee a very ancient calling, it is full of paines and full of profit, <hi>much increaſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon) doth come by the labour of the Oxe, but where no Oxe is the crib is empty.</hi> You ſee it hath the precedencie of the Shepheard, for the elder ſonne was aſſigned to this trade as the moſt neceſſary. Wherefore mee thinkes they doe not ſhew themſelves to be of the ſame minde with <hi>Adam,</hi> that are ſtill ready to pull downe tillage and ſet up paſtorage, as I may call it. Indeed paſtorage gives moſt private gaine to one or two men, and therefore they that are led more by ſelfe love then by charity or the love of mankind, are more affected to it; but ſurely Gods pleaſure was in making the World to make proviſion for a multitude to live in convenient abundance, rather then for a few to live in exceſſive riches. Howſoever you ſee this is good in <hi>Caine,</hi> he imbraced a calling and lived painefully therein, for hee was tilling the ground, he did not alone take upon him the name of a Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but did exerciſe himſelfe in the workes of that calling.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note>Secondly, <hi>Caine</hi> was religious too, at leaſt in reſpect of the outward acts, <hi>for in proceſſe of time hee brought a gift to the Lord of the fruit of the ground,</hi> hee worſhipped God by offering ſomething to him of that which by his goodneſſe and bleſſing the earth did bring forth unto him. The Lord will be ſerved even with our coſts, with gifts, with rendring him backe againe ſomething of that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath given us. He commanded <hi>Iſrael</hi> not to appeare before him emptie, but to bring free-will-offerings and heave offerings of their hands. God loves not an empty worſhipper, he is liberall to us, he would have us alſo liberall to him, wee receive much from him, he lookes to receive ſomething of us, that ſo we may actually acknowledge him to be the giver of all. He is not contented that the mouth worſhip him in prayers and praiſes, nor the eare in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and attending to him, nor the body in bowing it ſelfe to him, nor the hands in lifting up themſelves, but he will be honoured with our goods, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9. even with our ſubſtance. For though he hath not now commanded any thing to be burnt upon the Altar, having aboliſhed all Sacrifices by ſending his Sonne, to offer up himſelfe in Sacrifice for our ſinnes, that he might take away our ſinnes by that one offering once for all; yet now he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

ſuch a worſhip as cannot be maintained without coſt, in regard of the perſons attending it and the inſtruments of it, and hee hath now appointed them to reape our earthly things in his ſteed, which in his ſteed doe ſowe unto us ſpirituall things. Marke this then as a thing in it ſelfe good, to worſhip God and to worſhip him with giving a gift unto him, as alſo in the Pſalme hee ſaith, <hi>bring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to him that ought to be feared.</hi>

                  <hi>Caines</hi> faults in particular: 1. He was an Hypocrite.</note>But let us looke into his vices and faults.

Whoſoever is carefull to come to Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, to pray, heare, reade, receive the Sacraments, and the like acts of religion, and doth ſo careleſly, overly, and negligently performe them, as not in them to ſeeke and attaine true ſanctity and recovering out of the ſnare of the Divell and power of ſinne, (for theſe effects of true religion are not denied to any in and by thoſe ordinances but to thoſe which neglect to ſerve for them in and by theſe Ordinances) he is a very <hi>Caine</hi> that is, an Hypocrite.

            <p>The ſecond ſinne of <hi>Caine</hi> followes,<note place="margin">2.

This is a fearefull ſinne, when a man is puniſhed, to be vexed at the puniſhment, and not take care to ſee and reforme the ſinne which cauſeth the puniſhment. This is to accuſe God as the Author of the evill, and not himſelfe, and ſo to juſtifie himſelfe above God; this is to ſhew a predominancy of pride and blindneſſe, that out of an high opinion of himſelfe hath his minde mufled as it were from ſeeing his owne faults, it is to ſhew that he ſerveth that ſinne which puniſhments cannot make him humbly to confeſſe; and this wrath and falne countenance was procured through envie againſt his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for he did not onely vexe himſelfe becauſe his one Sacrifice found no approbation, but alſo hated his Brother, becauſe his was accepted, as appeares, becauſe God in reprooving his ſullen and dogged lookes, doth tell him inſtantly, that <hi>unto thee ſhall be his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,</hi> that is, I know <hi>Caine</hi> what aileth thee, thou art wrath againſt thy Brother, and hateſt him, becauſe he is more regarded by mee then thy ſelfe, but know that I intend not to take away the ſuperiority which thine age gives thee, he ſhall be thine inferiour in reſpect of governement, though he be better then thy ſelfe in vertues.

Did not mend his fault though he was gently admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by God himſelfe.</note> that when God himſelfe did gently and duely admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him of his fault, and ſought to aſſwage his hatred and his wrath, yet he did nothing at all reforme it, but rather grew worſe, ſhewing that envie carried him away ſtill, and hee did nouriſh and foſter, not oppoſe and reſiſt it. For God came and ſhewed him good reaſon, both that hee ſhould not be angry at his not being accepted, and alſo that he ſhould not have a grudge againſt his Brother becauſe he was accepted, <hi>for if thou doe well,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>ſhalt thou not be accepted,</hi> that is, not thy Brother is an impediment to any reſpecting of thy ſelfe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:27208:24"/>
and thy Sacrifice, but thine ill doing. Thou ſerveſt mee with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſervice, but thou art a bad man and liveſt not well, therefore muſt not I regard thy ſervice, for I tell thee, my pure nature is ſuch, that if men be of ſinfull lives and wicked, their prayers and oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo farre from pleaſing me, that they be abomination to me: therefore doe I not care for thee nor thy religion, ſo long as thou continueſt impenitent, and a wicked liver, but if thou frame thy ſelfe to doe well, to repent and amend thy life, and live holily, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhalt thou be accepted, as if hee had told him, that hee ought to amend his life, and might ſo ſet himſelf about it, as to obtaine help and power to do it. For even to any reprobate may any man ſay as much as God to <hi>Caine</hi> here, there is no neceſſity of thy being caſt off by God, ſet to amend thy life, and he will take thee into favour, and then ſhould he alſo be taken into favour, and his gifts regarded. For though the Sacrifice of ſinners be odious to God, yet the prayer of the upright is his delight. So no cauſe of <hi>Caines</hi> wrath and envie, ſeeing the cauſe of his Brothers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preferred before him is his owne naughtineſſe, not any partiality in God nor trickes that his Brother had uſed. Againe, there is no cauſe he ſhould hate his Brother, who ſhould ſtill continue an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in ſubjection to him. All this notwithſtanding uttered by God himſelfe, yet <hi>Caine</hi> continued his ſower lookes and bitter thoughts againſt his Brother, onely becauſe his Brother was better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and had received more approbation and acceptation from God then himſelfe. Note this fault, he would not be amended by words, he hardned himſelfe againſt an admonition.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4.

Moreover, Murder that is <hi>Caines</hi> ſinne, and with this ſinne of murder is joyned fraud and guile, and fearing man more then God: for he ſpake to him and gat him out, and then roſe up againſt him, when they were together alone in the field, ſo it was a pretended and premeditated murder, he uſed words of kindneſſe, at leaſt which did not ſhew forth any ill intention, for then would not <hi>Abel</hi> have gone with him, and having him in a ſolitary place where no man could ſee him to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or hinder him, there not regarding Gods preſence, hee tooke away his life and ſpilt his blood on the ground.

it, nor of himſelfe ranne to God with humble confeſſion, nay when God came to bring him to repentance, then hee ſtood in deniall of his fault, and was angry with God for going about to charge him with his Brother; for when the Lord came and asked him where his Brother was, he made anſwer that he could not tell, lying to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe you ſee, and ſhewing himſelfe to be altogether ignorant, or at leaſt heedleſſe of his All-ſeeing eye, and in a kind of diſcontent as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Lord, why he ſhould aske of him, where <hi>Abel</hi> was, ſeeing no man had ever appointed him to be <hi>Abels</hi> keeper.</p>
            <p>Here is a fearefull ſinne not to confeſſe a ſinne committed, but to lie and ſeeke if he could to hide it from God by deniall. So that <hi>Caine</hi> was growne worſe then <hi>Adam,</hi> he onely excuſed the fault, he denies, ſaying, he could not tell what was become of him whom himſelfe had murdered, ſo denying in his heart that God was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in all places and ſaw all things. So his heart was hardned in wickedneſſe, and he was growne a deſpiſer of God, a denier of his Omniſcience, and he had made himſelfe quite impenitent.</p>
            <p>Impenitencie in his ſinnes, that was another of <hi>Caines</hi> faults. Inſtead of falling downe and ſaying, I have ſinned, he ſaith, I have not done it, thou doſt unjuſtly in asking me ſuch a queſtion, like the Phariſees, that after they had killed Chriſt, were ſo farre from repenting, that they ſeemed to take it in high diſdaine, that the Apoſtles would ſeeme to bring that mans bloud upon them. Marke this ſinne, I ſay marke it, he hides his ſinne, denies it, will not goe to God with humble confeſſions and ſupplications. This is to be a <hi>Caine,</hi> to commit great ſinnes, and continue remorſeleſſe and unrepentant, not regarding to confeſſe no not to God himſelfe, though God uſe meanes to make him ſee and confeſſe.</p>
            <p>Now another fault is,<note place="margin">6. He muttered and deſpaired</note> that after God had cenſured him for his offence, he grumbled and deſpaired, for his ſpeeches carry an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of both theſe vices, and are uttered, ſo that they will beare both renderings, <hi>My ſinne is greater then can be pardonad,</hi> or, <hi>My pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is greater then I can beare.</hi> So <hi>Caine</hi> was poſſeſſed with a mixture of deſperateneſſe and murmuring, he denies God the honour of his mercy in not conceiving him able to forgive that ſin, therfore he thought it in vaine to confeſſe and aske pardon and ſo forbare to doe it, and he thought the puniſhment unjuſt and too ſevere, as being more then hee could beare, as if God in puniſhing an unpenitent ſinner ſhould looke not what the ſinne did deſerve, but what the ſinner could undergoe. Whereas puniſhment muſt be proportioned to the greatneſſe of the fault, not the ſtrength of the offendor. He ſhould have cryed out of the greatneſſe of the ſinne, not of the puniſhment, hee ſhould have confeſſed the greatneſſe of Gods mercy, but he mutters againſt him as both unjuſt and unmercifull, and ſo repents not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, complaining that God had laide him open to all mens injuries now, ſo that every one might kill him. This is a <hi>Caine,</hi> a man ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſinne that he can neither ſubmit to Gods juſtice nor implore
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27208:25"/>
his mercy, but denies the one, and calumniates the other, and ſo perſiſts impenitently.</p>

               <note place="margin">1. His benefits, had poſterity and lived a long life, and was preſerved from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of all men.</note>Firſt good, you ſee God gave him a ſonne and ſonnes ſonne, and continued his life along time to give him ſpace of repentance, and ſet a mark upon him to ſave him from the violence of all men, threatening to puniſh him ſeven-fold, that is, ſeven times as much as he had hurt <hi>Caine</hi> if any ſhould kill him. Seeing it pleaſed not God to tell us what this marke was with which hee noted this prime murtherer; it is fondneſſe in us to weary our ſelves with conjectures; ſome think it was viſible to all men, but what I know not, nor I am ſure can any man elſe tell, but it was the goodneſſe of God to ſecure him of life who had deſerved death, for the Law of putting the murderer to death was not yet, and God would not put <hi>Adam</hi> to ſo hard a taske as killing his owne ſonne, but would ſhew himſelfe to be above Law, in forbearing to doe that which he will not ſuffer a Magiſtrate to forbeare, even putting to death of a wilfull murderer; yea, it was the great goodneſſe of God to give him health and many children, and childrens children, and to grant him riches and proſperity in the world abundantly if it had beene poſſible to have drawne him to repentance,<note place="margin">2. God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed him meanes to keepe him from ſin and to draw him out of ſinne.</note> yea it was a great benefit that God came gently to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him of his inward malice, if it might have beene to have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the breaking of it out into murder, and after it was done to come againe with this gentle ſecond admonition, if it had beene poſſible to have melted him and have drawne him to ſubmiſſive humiliation. So God vouchſafed him meanes to keepe him from ſinne and to draw him out of ſinne, and time long enough to make uſe of thoſe meanes, and many benefits to allure him to make uſe of them, thus good is God even to ſinners, and impenitent ſinners, to offer them meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and acceptation upon their repentance, and vouchſafe them ſtore of good things for a long time, notwithſtanding their obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in refuſing to repent.</p>

            <p>Thus we have done with <hi>Caines</hi> life,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caines</hi> death not mentioned</note> and for his death the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vouchſafes not to mention it, nor how long he lived, but he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a long time even to ſee the ſonnes of <hi>Lamech,</hi> who was the ſixt generation from him, and vaunted that if God would ſo avenge <hi>Caine,</hi> he would be avenged more, by which ſpeech it is very probable that <hi>Caine</hi> was then alive.</p>
            <p>So we have ſpoken all we have to ſpeake of <hi>Caine.</hi> Now I will make ſome uſe of all.</p>

               <note place="margin">The uſe of all.</note> I pray you learne at leaſt to be as good as ſo bad a man was, and therefore may ſure be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by naturall indeavours. You ſee <hi>Caine</hi> did not give himſelfe to runne idling about the world, but ſubmitted to his Fathers go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſo farre as to give himſelfe to Husbandry. O let no man turne himſelfe into a cipher, nay into an excrement that lives in the world to no purpoſe, yea to bad purpoſe; for hee ſhall not but doe naughtily that will doe nothing, ſet your ſelves therefore to have and to follow ſome calling and employment. Live not like thoſe play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creatures, imperfect pictures of men, but of ſuch men the fitreſt emblemes, like apes and monkeys onely to skip up and downe and to make ſport, but live to beſtow your ſelves in ſome profitable vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for your owne and the common good.</p>
            <p>If any ſay <hi>Caine</hi> was neceſſitated to it, becauſe there were no other to till the ground for them he being <hi>Adams</hi> firſt-borne.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, I deſire you ſhould live ſomewhat better then <hi>Caine</hi> and doe good out of choice, which perhaps he might doe out of neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that though you be not neceſſitated to any cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by want, yet wiſdome and a good conſcience binde you, for muſt you not ſubmit to that of God, <hi>In the ſweate of thy browes ſhalt thou eate,</hi> and to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>he ſhall eate the labour of his hands,</hi> and to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> which condemnes the inordinate walkers which wrought not at all, and is it not wiſdome to forbeare walking on a thorne hedge, which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith the idle man doth? and to prevent many occaſions, as the having no calling, and being careleſſe of it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:27208:26"/>
will ſurely bring. I ſay againe then, be as good as <hi>Caine,</hi> have and follow ſome calling.</p>
            <p>Againe, looke that there be ſome at leaſt outſide of religion in you, worſhip God and be not ſo much lovers of money as not to give him ſomething, even to be at coſt for his worſhip in ſuch kind as coſt is now needfull, as they were to performe a worſhip then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the coſt notwithſtanding. Be not profane to neglect Gods Worſhip out of ſleighting it, be not niggards to put of God with as little as you can, but give him of the fruits of your ground; and now know that that is given to God which is given to the maintenance of his Miniſters which performe his Worſhip, and other inſtruments neceſſary to the performance of it, as a fit place and the like: O be as good as a <hi>Caine,</hi> nay willing to be at coſt in Gods Worſhip and for it.</p>
            <p>Alſo ſatisfie your ſelves with one wife, for <hi>Caine</hi> did ſo, he knew his wife, wives he had not.</p>
            <p>Yea, be builders up of your families by thrift and husbandry, for ſo could <hi>Caine,</hi> not pullers of them downe by riot and unthriftineſſe: ſay to thyſelfe, How ſhall this firſt of all bad men riſe up in judgement againſt mee, if I cannot frame my ſelfe at leaſt to be as good as he was? A man ſhould even bluſh to thinke what is the eldeſt ſonne of the Divell more vertuous then I am, O how bad a man am I then.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt make ſome good uſe of that was bad in <hi>Caine,</hi> which is double. Firſt, to take great heed to our ſelves to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe vices, and ſhun thoſe ſinnes which we finde related of him. <hi>Caine</hi> was a very Hypocrite, a man that contented himſelfe with the outward acts of Gods Worſhip, but was not Sanctified, did not frame his heart to pleaſe God and ſet himſelfe to doe well. O take heed to your ſelves that you be not ſuch, but labour to preſent your hearts to God, and in all his ſervices to offer your ſoules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to him, and not alone the externall ſervice, ſeeke in and by the duties of religion to be made new creatures. Joyne care of a good life in your whole converſation with your outward devotion, then you ſhall not be Hypocrites, but uprright. Beware of Hypocriſie, find out it ſelfe and its ill effects, lament them, confeſſe them, pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Be afraid leaſt you ſhould prove Hypocrites, cry to God to keepe you from being ſuch, and to make you ſincere. An Hypocrite is apt to runne into all ſinne, nothing is accepted from him, he is apt to fall away into open profaneneſſe, and to be quite caſt of by God for his ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſignes of an Hypocrite.</note>And you may ſee in <hi>Caine</hi> what be the ſignes of an Hypocrite. 1. Envie at thoſe that be better then himſelfe, and even hating them becauſe they have better eſteeme then himſelfe. 2. Not ſtriving to reforme his ſinnes when hee is admoniſhed, nor confeſſe them to God, and craving helpe againſt them, but rather perſiſting in them and denying them. 3. Chaſing at admonitions. 4. Caſting of at laſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:27208:26"/>
all care of religion. 5. Murmuring againſt God for the greatneſſe of his puniſhment and ſo deſpairing of his mercy as to run away from him. O beware of all theſe ſignes of prevailing Hypocriſie, and do as <hi>Caine</hi> ſhould have don. Strive againſt guile, ſet againſt envie, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to profit by Gods admonitions in his Word, though hee come not now in perſon to admoniſh you. If you have ſinned confeſſe it to God, ſtoope to his Juſtice, confeſſe him righteous if he deſtroy you. Hold faſt a perſwaſion of the poſſibility of having your ſins pardoned how great ſoever, and a hope of finding pardon at leaſt in ſuch a degree as may make you runne penitently to God and boldly to crave pardon. And moſt of all, take heed of growing utterly impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent out of deſpaire, and goe not about to burie your ſelves in the world and ſo to eaſe the torments of your conſciences, but by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble falling downe before God, ſeeke for mercy which will indeed refreſh you. Profit your ſelves by the lamentable and tragicall ſtory of <hi>Caine.</hi> And above all, take heed of letting envie proceed to that height as to carrie you into actuall murder, but reſiſt and oppoſe it, and caſt it out of your hearts, that it may not bring you to be ſpillers of innocent blood, that is a crying ſinne, and you ſee what torment and hardneſſe it is apt to bring upon the committer, chiefely if the cauſe of hatred and envie be goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>Againe, bleſſe God heartily for preſerving you from envie, from murder, from hypocriſie, from muttering, from deſpaire, from open profaneneſſe, from meere and prevailing worldlineſſe. For wee have the ſame nature that <hi>Caine,</hi> the ſame corruptions, full of pride, full of hypocriſie, full of ignorance of God, and apt to be bold to any evill if wee may conceale it from men. Wee who have the ſelfe-ſame bad nature, if God have preſerved us from ſo mighty prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and breaking forth of corruption, let us not lift up our ſelves above others, but give the glory to God, and be ſatisfied with the comfort, not daring to take the praiſe unto our ſelves, each one of us in his kinde would be as bad as <hi>Caine,</hi> if God had in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner left us unto our corruptions and the temptations. O that wee could be humbly thankefull for our preſervation from ſuch ſoule ſinnes and crimes.</p>
            <p>Now let us remember <hi>Caines</hi> miſeries and croſſes, and let us affright our ſelves from ſinnes by them. Thinke, would I have God make mee a fugitive and a runnagate, fill mine eares with the voice of terrour, and make a dreadfull ſound poſſeſſe mine heart alwaies, curſe the things I take in hand for my ſake, as hee did the earth for <hi>Caines</hi> ſake, deliver mee up to groſſe ſinnes, to hardneſſe and utter prophaneneſſe, to impenitencie and deſpaire, and a meere forſaking of God and Apoſtacie; then let mee not be an Hypocrite, let mee not mocke God with ſhewes, let mee not ſleight reproofes not caring to amend. Let me not hide my ſinnes and allow my ſelfe to doe evill in ſecret, fearing mans eyes more then Gods. Let mee not mutter againſt his Juſtice, let mee not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:27208:27"/>
denie his Mercy. Let mee not runne into the ſinnes of <hi>Caine,</hi> which by degrees procured to him this miſchiefe. Hypocriſie brought forth rejecting his ſervice, not profiting by that chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought forth diſcontent and envie againſt his Brother, not hearkening to reproofe to reſiſt envie, brought forth murder, not confeſſing and lamenting that, but hiding it, brought forth Gods judgement to make him a fugitive, not ſtooping to that, but mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, brought forth deſpaire, and that utter Apoſtacie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe. Beware of theſe ſinnes which you ſee ſo fearefully pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and affright your ſelves from theſe faults by the miſerable effects of them in <hi>Caine.</hi> Take great care that ſinne make not ſuch a progreſſe in your ſoules, till it utterly ſeparate you from God, as it did <hi>Caine.</hi> Wee have more and clearer meanes then <hi>Caine,</hi> beſides his evill to be our warning; if wee proove as bad as he, wee ſhall fare much worſe, becauſe of that aggravation of ſinne which it will receive from this conſideration. Tremble to thinke of yeelding to Hypocriſie, envie, murder, muttering, deſpaire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> flie from thoſe waies which brought <hi>Caine</hi> to ruine. Yea learne thankefullneſſe to God, that hee hath not laid ſuch miſeries upon you as upon <hi>Caine, viz.</hi> a terrified conſcience and a curſe upon your eſtates that can affoord you no comfort, and an heart poſſeſſed with deſperate fancies and impatient riſings againſt God. Theſe be fearefull evills, wee alſo have deſerved them, but God hath not inflicted them upon many of us. O let our hearts rejoyce in his goodneſſe that hath delivered us, and let us make uſe of his patience to draw us to repentance, that wee doe not pull the ſame upon our ſelves hereafter.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, from <hi>Caines</hi> benefits, I pray you learne to ſee the bounty of God which gives great outward benefits to the worſt men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by aſſuring your ſelves that hee will provide well enough for you that are his owne people. Will he preſerve <hi>Caine</hi> from being ſlaine and not mee that deſire to feare him? Did he offer mercy to <hi>Caine</hi> if hee would doe well, will hee not accept mee that deſire to doe well and to turne to him? Did hee give <hi>Caine</hi> a City and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, will hee not give to mee things needfull for mee and mine? Gods mercy to the worſt muſt make his people certaine, that no good thing ſhall be wanting to them.</p>
            <p>Againe, you muſt learne not highly to eſteeme theſe earthly things. Did not <hi>Caine</hi> even after his curſing and caſting off yet flouriſh in worldly things, beget children, build a City, ſee his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens children gallantly maintained in the world, growing in arts and riches? Surely there is no cauſe of being good in our owne eyes, becauſe wee have gotten that which a <hi>Caine</hi> may get. Wee muſt not be ſo fooliſh as to flatter our ſelves in a conceit that God is our God, becauſe wee meete with ſuch droſſie benefits and meane favours as a very reprobate, and a fugitive may have in abundance. Indeed if God give theſe things with an heart to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:27208:27"/>
make uſe of them, to doe good to others, to be thankefull to God, to be mooved to repentance, and to grow better, and be drawne neerer to God, and more carefull of obeying and worſhipping him, this is a ſigne of his ſpeciall favour, otherwiſe to have ſuch things as theſe and ſtill continue in impenitencie and to grow worſe by them rather then better, is a proofe that a man is fatted to deſtruction, rather then God the giver of theſe things doth favour him. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>

The Shepheards calling is now a neceſſary calling as well as the Husbandmans, though not equally neceſſary: but wee finde in experience, that it is a calling ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to Husbandrie, for that the profitable ſheepe is not alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall for her fleſh and skinne, but alſo for her ſoyle, and that in ſuch degree profitable, as in many places they could ſcarce have any corne growing by their art and paines in Husbandry, if the ſheepes dung did not fat the ground. And this is I conceive one of the beſt uſes of the ſheep when ſhe becomes attendant to the place. O that this ſimple and harmeleſſe creature might not be changed into a moſt ravenous and devouring creature, thorough the rapine and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of thoſe men which thinke all too little for themſelves, and had rather dwell alone or amongſt beaſts then amongſt a number of Tenants, and as the members of a Towne-ſhip or a Church.

I meane the Shepheard doth eate out the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman. But you ſee that as well <hi>Abel</hi> as <hi>Caine</hi> was painefull in his calling, and was brought up in ſome externall and worldly buſineſſe, wherein he might ſerve God, advantage the world, and exerciſe and profit himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Surely true piety and godlineſſe will very well accord with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in a calling, and it is but mens miſtake if they thinke that their vocations hinder them from the true Worſhipping of God; <hi>Abel</hi> as well as <hi>Caine</hi> had his trade of life. The miſerable corruption of our nature will turne all things into occaſions of hurt and miſchiefe, and make them meanes of interrupting us in good waies, but elſe a calling duely followed by exerciſing the graces of Gods Spirit, and humbling and taming the fleſh, and well imploying the thoughts, and preventing many temptations and opportunities of ſinning, doth greatly further our growth in piety, and is farre from being any juſt hinderance unto it: we muſt therefore marke this in <hi>Abel</hi> as well as <hi>Caine,</hi> and be carefull to imitate it.</p>
            <p>All you that have children to educate, bring them up to ſome calling. Let them be as members not excrements in the body of humane ſocieties.<note place="margin">It is good to have a calling and be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in it.</note> All you that are already come to ſuch a ſtate as you can diſcerne betweene good and evill, apply your ſelves to ſome calling, ſome worke of body or minde, ſome conſtant and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led imployment in ſome lawfull actions, tending to the common good and your own, that you may be ſure as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, to labour if not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27208:29"/>
with your hands, yet with your heads the thing that is good, that you may have to give, and that you may not be counted inordinate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly walkers, not working at all but being buſie bodies, workers round <hi>about</hi> as the word ſignifieth, do nothing but fetch friskes and vagaries through the world. O expoſe not your ſelves and yours to ſo much miſery as to have nothing to do. An empty veſſel is fit to receive any liquor that is powred into it; the Divell will put you on evill imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if you do not beſtow your ſelves on good: A bird that ſitteth ſtill on a tree is eaſily hit with a piece or croſſe-bow, but it is hard to take the flying bird. It is eaſie for Satan to intangle with his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations the Idlesbee, but hard to faſten on the man of imployments. The Lord commends and rewards diligence in a calling, and bids know the ſtate of thy flocke, and bids men goe and learne of the Piſmire, and diſcommends idleneſſe and ſluggiſhneſſe, and threatens him that followes the idle. Let good <hi>Abel</hi> teach you faithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in your calling. Caſt away ſluggiſhneſſe and unthriftineſſe, wearing out your bodies in vanities and worſe then vanities, and ſet your ſelves to ſome ſuch worke as may make you able to anſwer the queſtion of God and your Maſter when hee ſhall call you to account for the laying out of ſo pretious a thing as time.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, hee was religious and devout,<note place="margin">2. Was religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> hee brought of the fruit of his flocks, yea of the firſtlings and of the fat thereof. He did bring to God one of the beſt and fatteſt of his Rammes, or Ewes, for Weathers were not for Sacrifice, and no maimed thing was to be offered on Gods Altar. It is not obſerved of <hi>Caine,</hi> that hee brought of the firſt fruites and beſt of his corne or other graine: It is likely that the Holy Ghoſt would have done this office of a faithfull Hiſtorian, and have given <hi>Caine</hi> his due by telling the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as well as the matter of his offering, if it had beene as well qualified in this reſpect as his Brothers. Wherefore when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Abels</hi> offering, becauſe it was of the choice and fatteſt of his flock, it may be well thought in forbearing to ſay any thing in like commendation of <hi>Caines,</hi> that hee tooke no great care, whether it were of the beſt or not, and therefore wee may well conceive that one cauſe of Gods rejecting <hi>Caines</hi> Sacrifice was, becauſe hee did not bring of the beſt of his fruites, as one cauſe of his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Abels</hi> was becauſe hee did bring of the choiceſt of his flock, not that God looketh to theſe outward things, but to the minde of the doer, which for the moſt part (if neceſſity hinder not) doth ſhew it ſelfe in the valew and worth of the gift. He that loves God will bring him as full a Sacrifice as hee can, hee that loves him not will give him as leane a Sacrifice as it may ſtand with his credit to give. A man whoſe heart is not upright with God will be at as little coſt with him as is poſſible. A man that is upright with him will inlarge his bounty towards him, you ſhall ſee in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. that God refuſeth the Sacrifices, becauſe they were halt and <hi>blinde, the worſt and refuge of all, and he curſeth the deceiver that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27208:30"/>
hath in his flock a male, and voweth and ſacrificeth to the Lord a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt thing,</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 8. he ſaith, <hi>Offer it now to thy governour will hee be pleaſed with thee and accept thy perſon ſaith the Lord?</hi> The Lord knowes that niggardlineſſe towards him ſhewes want of love and faith, but freeneſſe and bounty ſhewes truth of love and of faith, and becauſe he looketh to the heart, therefore hee liketh that gift which comes from a loving and faithfull heart, and hates that which comes from a contrary heart.</p>
            <p>Learne therein to imitate <hi>Abel,</hi> bring to God the beſt things you have, he muſt have the fat, the fat I ſay of your heards or flocks. The chiefeſt of your affections muſt be his, and your affections muſt ſhew themſelves in action. You muſt be willing to ſerve him with a coſtly ſervice, and be ever of <hi>Davids</hi> mind that ſaid, I will not ſerve God without charge.</p>
            <p>Now theſe two things you have in the Text of <hi>Abel,</hi> two other things you have in another place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>He offered a better Sacrifice then Caine</hi> by faith.<note place="margin">3. He offered in faith.</note> Hee offered in faith, and that cauſed him to bring a better, that is, I ſuppoſe he meanes there, a more coſtly Sacrifice of better worth and valew, of more price and coſt, not the coſt but the faith that made him willing to be at the coſt, and the coſt alone as it was a fruit and ſigne of the faith did content God, and made the Sacrifice acceptable.</p>
            <p>Let us learne therefore to doe all wee doe in faith. The faith that good <hi>Abel</hi> had was the ſame that after is commended in <hi>Henoch,</hi> hee was perſwaded that God was and was a rewarder of them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſeeke him, it was ſuch as that which the Apoſtle there deſcribeth, <hi>it was the evidence of things not ſeene and the ſubſtance of things hoped for.</hi> It was ſuch an apprehenſion of Gods being and goodneſſe to true Converts, and ſuch a perſwaſion of his will to give him the future inviſible things hoped for, as made <hi>Abel</hi> ſerve God in the courſe of his life in righteouſneſſe, and not alone for a time to come to the Altar and offer Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Sacrificing was a profeſſion of their owne guiltineſſe, ſubmitting themſelves to the Juſtice of God, as men worthy to die and be burnt, as that beaſt or other thing to be burnt, but withall of their hope that God would pardon them for his goodneſſe ſake through that true Sacrifice which was to come. And hee that offered Sacrifice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this faith of Gods accepting him for his mercy ſake, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acknowledgement of his worthineſſe to periſh, did not pleaſe God, and all our Sacrifices muſt be done in faith, now more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, becauſe we have a fuller revelation, wee muſt doe all wee doe in faith, not alone a perſwaſion of the lawfullneſſe of what we doe, but alſo an indeavour to truſt particularly for our acceptation both of perſons and Sacrifices in Chriſt, not in the worthineſſe of our ſelves or of our workes. He that hath this faith, he and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices ſhall pleaſe God, hee that hath it not cannot pleaſe God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth. Let mee therefore commend unto you the care of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:27208:30"/>
ſearching into your hearts, whether you have this faith or no, <hi>viz.</hi> that you beleeve your ſelves in your ſelves to be miſerable ſinners, but confeſſe that Chriſt Jeſus is a perfect Saviour, and therefore even truſt upon Gods mercie in him for grace and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>But the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Abel</hi> was righteous, and ſaith,<note place="margin">4. Was righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> that he obtained witneſſe that hee was righteous. Where hath hee that witneſſe? Partly in that God teſtified of his gifts by accepting them (for he accepts nothing but that which comes from a righteous man, he heareth no ſinners,) or more fully from the mouth of our bleſſed Saviour, who calleth him righteous <hi>Abel.</hi> Note therefore that <hi>Abel</hi> was a righteous man. The Scriptures give infinite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and commendation to the righteous man.</p>
            <p>Now there is a righteouſneſſe of the Law and of the Goſpell.<note place="margin">A twofold righteouſneſſe of the Law and Goſpell. Gal. 2.16. Rom. 3 10. Job 9 31.</note> A righteous man by the Law we ſhall finde none in all the world, for S. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, that <hi>by the workes of the Law no fleſh ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God,</hi> and that <hi>there is none righteous, no not one,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith of himſelfe in this ſence, that <hi>if hee went to juſtifie himſelfe, his owne cloathes would defile him.</hi> This righteouſneſſe ſtandeth in an exact conformity to the Law of God in that a man hath not committed, neither is prone and inclined to commit any of the things which the Law doth forbid, nor hath not omitted nor is not prone to omit any of the things which the Law doth command, but is utterly free from all ſinne of omiſſion and commiſſion, and hath perfectly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law in all points and degrees.

               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.22.</note>

               <hi>If there had beene a Law given which could have given life, righteouſneſſe had beene by the Law,</hi> ſo that there was not a Law given that could give life, and therefore the Pſalmiſt confeſſeth, that <hi>in Gods ſight there is no fleſh righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 143.2.</note> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> durſt not ſtand to this righteouſneſſe which was his owne by the Law. This Legall righteouſneſſe it would juſtifie if we had it, but wee have it not, for wee loſt it in our firſt Parents, in whom all ſinned and all died, all were made ſinfull and mortall creatures, and a ſinfull mortall creature cannot poſſibly performe ſuch a Law, as was given to a ſinneleſſe and immortall creature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee muſt finde out another righteouſneſſe by which ſome men may be called righteous, and by which <hi>Abel</hi> was righteous, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by this righteouſneſſe the Scripture teſtifieth, that neither hee nor any other can be made righteous. This is the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, the righteouſneſſe of the Goſpell, the righteouſneſſe of God, the righteouſneſſe which is by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:27208:31"/>
even the righteouſneſſe of God without the Law, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which is by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A double righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe in the Goſpell. 1. Imputed.</note>Now there is a double righteouſneſſe taught in the Goſpell. The one is made ours by imputation and is not ours by inherencie; wee never performed it our ſelves, but another performed it for us and we have it imputed to us: It is by S. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribed thus. A righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe without workes imputed to the happy man, not ſimply without workes, for that is impoſſible, becauſe the Law cannot be fulfilled but by working according to its direction, and unleſſe the law be fulfilled there is no perfect righteouſneſſe, but a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without any workes of ours, and therefore without the Law too, for the Law accepteth of no righteouſneſſe but that which is wrought by our ſelves,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.3.</note> as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>hee wrought not but did truſt in him that juſtifies the ungodly. Abraham</hi> wrought diligently and plentifully, how then can it be ſaid that he wrought not? hee meaneth that he did not worke that by his owne workes hee might attaine this righteouſneſſe. By this righteouſneſſe alone we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. It is the perfect and exact righteouſneſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt accepted for us and put to our reckoning. For he was our ſurety, he tooke our nature, hee bare our ſinnes, hee fulfilled our duty and bare our puniſhment, and ſo ſatisfied Gods juſtice in our roome, and is become <hi>The Lord our righteouſneſſe.</hi> This is the one righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe commended to us by the Goſpell. To this and this alone we muſt cleave for the obtaining of remiſſion of ſinnes and life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall at the hands of God. By merit of this are we pronounced juſt by God at his heavenly Tribunall, and in the judgement of our owne conſciences, and hereafter ſhall be ſo pronounced openly at the laſt day, to this S. <hi>Paul</hi> cleaved. This the Goſpell taught, for therein is declared the righteouſneſſe of God from faith to faith.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Inherent.</note>But the Goſpell telleth of another righteouſneſſe that is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this, alwaies at the ſame time and by the ſame meanes given that this is given, and it is a quality inherent in us and wrought in us by the Spirit of God, and floweth immediately from our faith. The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth deſcribe it plainely, ſaying, that <hi>Wee muſt count our ſelves dead unto ſinne but alive unto God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.11.</note> and then ſaith. <hi>Wee muſt not yeeld our members as weapons of unrighteouſneſſe unto ſinne, but as weapons of righteouſneſſe to God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 13.</note> and ſaith, <hi>Wee are become ſervants to righteouſneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 19.</note> and that <hi>wee muſt yeeld our members ſervants unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> and againe, <hi>muſt raigne by righteouſneſſe unto life eternall.</hi> It is not the cauſe of our life but the way to it.<note place="margin">Via ad regnum, non cauſa reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandi. Bernard.</note> It is a vertue wrought in us, by which we are made able to ſtrive and indeavour, and deſire to keepe the Law. A man till he be juſtified by faith and reconciled to God, is eſtranged from the Lord and from the life of God and is an enemy in his minde, and is dead in ſinnes, and loves ſinne and will not leave it, and out of a ſtiffe and ſtrong bent of will to ſinne cannot but ſerve ſinne, and will and reſolve to continue ſerving it in one kinde or other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:27208:31"/>Now this is alſo a righteouſneſſe of the Goſpell, and it differs from that of the Law in two things, 1. In regard of the degree, it is imperfect and defective, failing in many things, but it is upright and ſincere, allowes not its failings, but with an upright deſire ſtriveth to perfection, and is ſtill labouring againſt its imperfections.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It differs from the righteouſneſſe of the Law in uſe; for the Law doth require this righteouſneſſe as an accompliſhment of the Covenant of workes, to juſtifie us before God by the merit and worth of it; but the Goſpell requireth this as an act of obedience alone to ſhew our thankfullneſſe, and to proove us truly juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, becauſe as it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.21.</note> 
               <hi>There is not a Law given which could give life,</hi> ſeeing <hi>that all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.23.</note> and whoſoever goes about to put this righteouſneſſe into the uſe of juſtifying him before God, I meane of attaining eternall life and remiſſion of ſinnes from God by vertue and worth of it, that man cannot but be damned, becauſe he cannot have the imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and the inherent both for that purpoſe. If he truſt to Chriſts righteouſneſſe he cannot truſt to his owne, if to his owne he cannot truſt to Chriſts, ſeeing S. <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth them as things contrary, ſaying, <hi>not having mine owne but Chriſts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3.9.</note> which were weakely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if a man could have both to the uſe of juſtifying: yea he ſaith, <hi>He that will be juſtified by the Law is fallen from grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.4.</note> and <hi>Chriſt is become of none effect unto him;</hi> and by the Law he ſeekes to be juſtified that ſeeketh to be juſtified before God by doing this and by his owne working.</p>
            <p>Now of a man that is thus righteous,<note place="margin">Three ſignes of a righteous man. Pſal. 119.48. Pſal. 119 5, 6.</note> there are three ſure plaine and evident ſignes. 1. Hee deſireth to know and doe all that God revealeth to him out of his Word. <hi>I have lifted up mine hands unto thy teſtimonies which I have loved, and O that my heart were directed to keepe thy righteous judgements, then ſhall I not be confounded when I have reſpect to all thy Commandements.</hi> 2.

            </p>
            <p>Now we have the good of <hi>Abel,</hi> we ſhould ſpeake of his evill, but wee have none to ſpeake of. For the Holy Ghoſt hath not told
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:27208:32"/>
us of any evill that hee committed, not becauſe he had none, but becauſe his life was ſo ſhort, and withall ſo good, that the Lord ſaw it not fit to make mention of any, and ſurely though the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doe report the faults of other godly men, yet it ſeemes here to ſet forth <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> as the two ſeeds, the one of the Woman, the other of the Serpent, and therefore of the good ſeed mentions no faults, becauſe in him God ſaw none, that is, would not impute any.</p>

The world is the number of unſanctified men in the world, theſe will hate ſuch as <hi>Abel</hi> the righteous, yea if Father be unrighteous and Sonne righteous. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther righteous and Brother unrighteous, Husband righteous and Wife unrighteous, the Father, Brother, Wife, will hate and maligne the childe, the Brother and the Husband. God hath put enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſeed of the Woman and of the Serpent; good and bad are of two contrary natures, what the one loveth the other hateth, and contrarily, this contrariety in diſpoſition will breed contrariety in affection. Hee that is <hi>Caine,</hi> a formall Hypocrite and ſatisfieth himſelfe with a bare outſide ſervice, will hate him that worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth in ſpirit and in truth,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.29.</note> 
               <hi>They that are after the fleſh will perſecute them that are after the ſpirit,</hi> and all that will live godly muſt ſuffer for it. Prepare your ſelves to meete with the ſame meaſure that <hi>Abel</hi> met withall; you had need of patience ſaith our Saviour. Be not diſcouraged at the hatred and ill uſage of wicked men, but have reſpect to the recompence of reward, looke to the end of your faith, ſet the joy before your eyes and feare not any of theſe things that you may ſuffer. An over-tender ſpirit is not fit to be Chriſts Souldier, if you will raigne with him you muſt be crucified with him. Arme, arme my Brethren, arme, you are in the battell, you muſt expect knocks, but be not diſmaied, the victory ſhall be yours. God will ſo ſtabliſh you that you ſhall not be driven out of the way of righteouſneſſe, by any thing that Satan can do by the world: and hee conquers that keepes cloſe to the waies of righteouſneſſe what ever he ſuffer.</p>

God, why did not God protect <hi>Abel</hi> when the world had ſo few Inhabitants? was it not pittie that one ſhould be taken out of it ſo untimely and in ſuch a manner? and much more was it not pittie that the more godly and the more uſefull ſhould be ſo ſoone bereft of life? It is a thing that a ſhallow wit is ready to impleade God for. But God is ſuch a ruler that will order things according to his owne perfect wiſedome. It ſhall be worſe in outward reſpects with the good then with the bad, the ſinner ſhall out-live the Saint, and flouriſh in the world when the other is rotting in the grave, and why ſo? that God may teach them hereby to looke for happineſſe in another world that is to come, that they may expect a better and induring ſubſtance in Heaven.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.19.</note>

Who knowes when or where he ſhall die, how ſoone, and by what meanes he muſt leave this world afore he be aware. Labour therfore to prepare for death every day, get faith, get repentance, get new obedience, get your ſinnes pardoned, and your ſelves ſanctified, that if death come ſodainely, yet it may not be ſodaine to you, becauſe you have made your ſelves ready for it, if we be thus fitted for death happie are we though it come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving warning, but if we have not ſo fitted our ſelves, we ſhall be moſt miſerable though our death be long and lingring, and come not with any violence.</p>
            <p>Yea we muſt learne to be thankefull to God for his goodneſſe in protecting us againſt the rage of evill men, that they be not able to cut us off in the midſt of our daies, as they would do if God did permit us to fall into their hands. No good man that liveth but ſome <hi>Caine</hi> or other would ſoone diſpatch them out of the world, and doe the ſame thing for them that <hi>Caine</hi> here did for <hi>Abel, for the ſinner hateth the righteous and gnaſheth againſt him with his teeth,</hi> but the Lord will not give him into his hands. It is a divine providence that maketh the godly dwell in ſafety in the midſt of their enemies, and walke in a fiery furnace and yet not be burned, and lie in the den of Lions and yet not be touched by them. Now therefore let <hi>Abels</hi> example put you in minde to be ready alwaies for death, and to obſerve the goodneſſe of God in ſaving you from the hands of ſinfull men and ſpirits, that they cannot deſtroy and devoure as their malice and

            <p>His faults are, 1.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lamechs</hi> faults, His Polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner of it.</note> He corrupted the ordinance of marriage by taking two wives; God at firſt made but one man and one woman and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them together, and <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid, <hi>they ſhall be one fleſh,</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee conceived it to be the will of God, that one woman ſhould ſerve for one man, and addes, <hi>A man ſhall forſake Father and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:27208:35"/>
Mother and cleave to his wife,</hi> not wives. But this man would not ſatisfie himſelfe with Gods appointment, his luſt (in all likelihood it was his luſt, for what other cauſe ſhould move him I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture) would not be contained within the bounds of lawfull matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. He dares adde a ſecond wife and ſo bring into the world a painted whoredome, a guilded adultery, a pretended marriage, but indeed a very breach of wedlock. For our Saviour Chriſt telleth us, that he <hi>which putteth away his wife and marrieth another commits adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> and if that be true as we muſt confeſſe,<note place="margin">Luke 16.18.</note> for his authority ſake that ſpake it, then without all queſtion hee that keepeth his former wife ſtill and will needs take another to her, is guilty too of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting adultery. The reaſon is cleare and cannot be denied. For if it were not adultery to have more women then one at one time, then the taking of another wife upon a cauſeleſſe divorce ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that odious title, and if it be ſo, poligamy muſt needs take the ſame title to it ſelfe. This was therefore a grievous audaciouſneſſe in this wicked man, that hee would leape over the poles as it were which God had fixed. The thing was naught, and his doing it firſt before others made it worſe in him, and made him guilty of their faults that after followed it upon his example. For indeed it was quickly taken up and practiſed in the world, inſomuch that it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and was practiſed alſo by him as a thing not reputed ſinfull. For when ſinne hath gotten yeeres and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples upon its backe it doth many times ceaſe to be counted what it is, and goes under the repute of a lawfull thing, though it be in it ſelfe even ſomewhat evidently unlawfull; becauſe partly the minde of man corrupted by the pleaſing or profitable effects of it, is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling not to thinke it ſinne, and the judgement is eaſily ſweyed by the will, and partly becauſe the example of men doth worke too much to draw unto evill, as an heavie thing is eaſily caſt downeward.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:27208:35"/>
which he did to another, to revenge ſeventie times and ſeven is to lay an evill 490 times more heavie then that received. The Lord of Heaven hath cauſe, becauſe hee hath authority, to inlarge his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing juſtice, and to execute a threat of ſeven times revenge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe after ſuch a threat to commit the fault makes it ſeven degree more faulty, as being an audacious deſpiſing of his anger, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſetting his threats at naught, but for any man to exceede meaſure ſo farre in puniſhing though he were a lawfull Magiſtrate, puniſhing the malefactor at the complaint and inſtance of the wronged perſon, it were a great offence. How much more then for a private man ſo farre to exceede all degrees in reſpect of a wrong done to himſelfe. Sure he that threatens to be revenged 400 times more then <hi>Caine,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelfe to be more excellent than <hi>Caine</hi> 400 times, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of the parties worth that was wronged, muſt the revenge be increaſed. O how proud a man was hee! that durſt ſo farre preferre himſelfe above his great grand-fathers Father, for ſo was <hi>Caine,</hi> who being then alive and departed from under the governement of <hi>Adam,</hi> was now the King of all the ſonnes that deſcended from him, during his life, and the Prieſt too, for King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Prieſt-hoods in thoſe firſt times went to the eldeſt of the family by ſucceſſion. Theſe were chiefe Rulers in matters civill and religious. He was therefore a very haughty minded man, and a very paſſionate angry man, and ſo a very revengefull man which ſpringeth from pride and and paſſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe be his faults, yet ſee how good and patient the Lord ſhewes himſelfe unto ſuch a wretch, for hee had two ſonnes by one wife,<note place="margin">His benefits, he had children</note>
and a ſonne and daughter by the other, God gave him the fruit of marriage, though he were the firſt that ſo ſhamefully abuſed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for God doth not inſtantly ſtretch forth a puniſhing arme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an offender, and theſe ſonnes of his too were very active and profitable men, of good parts and account, as appeares by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions mentioned in the Text.<note place="margin">2. His croſſes, hee led an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet life by reaſon of his wives.</note> But yet he is not left quite unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, for his life was unquiet, as appeareth by his threatning and bragging what he would doe, for ſuch kinde of threats be but boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings of the future time. It is not to be doubted of but that his two wives, what by the brawles which would fall out betwixt them and their children, and what by the ſtirres that they would make with him, each to have him take her part againſt the other, made his life uncomfortable, ſo that hee was faine to ſee if hee could make the matter a little better by big and violent words, to keepe them in awe by feare whom duty could not order. Now this is <hi>Lamech.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, to arme ourſelves againſt thoſe ſinnes, and to abound in the contrary vertues, for ſo it is our duty, as Bees doe honey out

of weeds, to gather good out of bad Examples. Come hither then and let mee examine you in Gods name. Is there not any amongſt you that hath violated marriage worſe then <hi>Lamech.</hi> He did ſinne by taking two wives. The Lawes would puniſh you for following him in that, and would not ſuffer you to keepe two women under the name of wives, have not you therefore falne to flat and downe-right adultery. If ſo, repent of this enormity; The Lord will not ſuffer the tranſgreſſors of his Covenant to beare it free if repentance doe not ſtay his hand.</p>
            <p>Yea have not ſome of you beene <hi>Lamechs</hi> in making the firſt breach into a ſinne; Inventers of evill things, S. <hi>Paul</hi> cals them which are the firſt which doe them, that runne into them not induced by any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer examples, but carried by their owne corruptions, and ſo by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the hedge, induce others to follow them: ſuch ſinners be the more grievous before God by how much they ſhew a more impudent diſpoſition, that dare leade the way to wickedneſſe, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves captaines and ring-leaders to ſo vile and miſchievous a thing, and ſuch ſinnes doe call for a larger meaſure of ſorrow and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Againe, have none of you beene paſſionate, angry, and full of threats, <hi>working in proud wrath</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> calls it, and as here, you may ſee wicked <hi>Lamech</hi> doing with an angry voice, and a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſutable thereto. You may be ſure he calls upon his wives to leave their brawling and let him ſpeake, and then bluſters out theſe words, that he would kill the man whoſoever ſhould wrong him. Are not there ſome men among you ſo mad and furious, that they threaten bloud and death to any that ſhall wrong them. O this wrathfull and angry roaring as I may call it, is a ſigne of much folly and pride, and therefore doe not pleaſe your ſelves in it, as they doe moſt times that are given to it, but abhorre it, and judge your ſelves for it, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly acknowledge to God, that you have deſerved his wrath for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your owne wrath ſo immoderately. And laſtly conſider, have you not beene revengefull men? that would take no wrong but returne death and ſlaughter for a ſtroke, a wound, and ſeven yea twenty, and if you were able an hundred blowes for one, yea death for a word ſpeaking, and a great evill for a little.</p>

               <note place="margin">Revenge is a great ſin.</note>Brethren, revenge is a fearefull ſinne; there are two waies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, ſome doe compaſſe it by maine ſtrength, preſently and openly if one wrong them, they raile or ſtrike and lay about them, as it were an angry Dog or Beare or other Beaſt, others be more ſtill in their revenge, they lay it up in ſtore and ſet it on the ſcore till a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity come, and then they pay him home with the like and more that hath wronged them, both theſe revenges be naught, and it is hard to ſay whether is the worſe of the twaine: the one hath more craft, the other more furie, both ſhew an heart deſtitute of all meekeneſſe and charity and faith. If you have found your ſelves ſo diſpoſed, untill you repent you ſhall be ſure to finde God as bitter againſt you. He
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:27208:36"/>
will be revenged of the revengefull. He will be an enemy to him that will fight and keepe a ſtirre if he be touched or wounded. Doe not count it valour to give ſtroke for ſtroke or wound for wound, or blow for blow, it is an helliſh valour, it is not man-hood, it is dog-hood, or I may terme it beare-hood, it is brutiſh, ſo will a Lion or a bruit creature.

I beſeech you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelves, and if you have found your ſelves carried away with revenge, and reſolve to be ſo ſtill, take notice that you be too like to <hi>Lamech</hi> to be the children of God.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.22.</note> Our Saviour commands us if our neighbour offend to forgive him till ſeventy times ſeven times, I thinke alluding to this very ſpeech of this here in the Text, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to teach you to labour to abound in patience, meekeneſſe, and forbearance, as much as he abounded in proud revengefullneſſe.</p>

            <p>And laſtly, I ſay if the wrongs be notorious and ſuch as it is not fit to ſuffer, God hath put the ſword of revenge into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates hands, and ſo farre as the heart is not imbittered with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but ſeeketh alone his owne defence and ſafety without trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing in the ſmart of an enemy, it is very lawfull to ſeeke him for reſcue.</p>

Their art is helpefull to all other Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences both for peace and warre, to them belongeth the making of all the neceſſarieſt inſtruments of husbandry, of all ſort of tooles for other trades and of armes alſo for the Souldier. No part of mans life can be without iron worke. A knife, a key, an hatchet, a forke, a ſaw, a mattock, a ſythe, a raking hooke, a chezill, a ſword, a ſpeare, a ſhield, an helmet, who can reckon up the things that Smiths do make for mans uſe. This was therefore an exceeding fruitfull inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo much the more to be commended by how much it is more weariſome and laborious, for it is you know a ſtrong labour in ſome things and a curious in other things, and much of it is much annoyed with heate about the fire. And thus hath God ſtored the world with needfull arts, by meanes of <hi>Lamechs</hi> ſonnes that were it ſeemeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified men.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The uſes of all.</note>We muſt make ſome uſe of all this, firſt, to be thankefull unto God that hath imparted to ſome men ſuch good wits and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:27208:37"/>
that they were able to finde out and perfect thoſe ſeverall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Callings, for how toyleſome and uncomfortable would our lives be if we did not enjoy theſe helpes and comforts. Even this naturall ability is from God and deſerveth thankes from us.</p>
            <p>Againe, men muſt ſet themſelves to be profitable to the world, by either inventing or adding to the inventions of others in any kinde. It is good to doe ſomething for which the world may be the better, and not to come into the world meerely as rats and mice onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure victuals and to runne ſqueaking up and downe. Be you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of ſuch, if you cannot invent and perfect an art, yet learne and follow ſome that is already invented. Theſe men were not idlesbees, doe naughts; O be you as good at leaſt as theſe ſonnes of <hi>Lamech,</hi> onely labour to be ſo moderate in following and uſing all theſe earthly things, that you be not earthly minded thereby, but may become carefull of things that pertaine to the ſoule and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, as well as of thoſe that belong to this preſent life and to this body of clay. It is good to uſe the world but not to love it, to ſet our hands on worke about the things of it, but not to ſet our hearts upon it. This is a baiting place and not a place of habitation, we make a journey through this world, we do not dwell in the world. O let our mindes and deſires and wiſhes be in Heaven, and let us doe thoſe outward things with reference unto Heaven, that by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting men and ſerving God in a calling, we may make our way to Heaven the eaſier, and our wages there the greater. And ſo much for the linage of <hi>Caine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we come to another off-ſpring of <hi>Adam.</hi> If is not to be thought that he remained childleſſe till the birth of <hi>Seth,</hi> or that God would ſmite him in that newneſſe of the world with ſo long a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe, or that he ſo long forbare ſociety with <hi>Evah.</hi> As it is ſaid, that he lived <hi>an hundred and thirty yeeres and begat Seth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 5.3.</note> ſo it is ſaid, hee <hi>lived long after and begat ſonnes and daughters;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is likely alſo, that in that hundred and thirty yeeres before he begat ſonnes and daughters, but becauſe the Lord intended to draw out the linage of Chriſt, therefore he lets all the reſt goe and faſtens alone upon <hi>Seth,</hi> of whom the promiſed ſeed was to come in a direct line: Of <hi>Seth</hi> then we muſt ſpeake.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seth</hi> little ſaid of him.</note> His Birth gladded <hi>Evah</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> too no doubt, becauſe they underſtood by revelation from God, that he ſhould be a godly man. Therefore hee is called <hi>Seth,</hi> that is, he hath appointed, becauſe ſaith <hi>Evah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4.25.</note> 
               <hi>God hath appointed mee another ſeed inſtead of</hi> Abel <hi>whom</hi> Caine <hi>ſlew.</hi> Loe it is an hundred and thirty yeares after and yet ſhee hath not forgotten the murder of <hi>Caine.</hi> The infamy of a ſinne will cleave long to a mans name, and the griefe of a croſſe if it be a ſtinging croſſe indeed as this was, will lie long upon the ſoule. But why ſaith ſhee a ſeede inſtead of <hi>Abel,</hi> it may be it was, becauſe ſhee ſaw little piety and goodneſſe in the other ſonnes and daughters: none of them was like <hi>Abel</hi> in religion and godlineſſe. But for <hi>Seth</hi> ſhee underſtood that God would make
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:27208:38"/>
him as good a man as <hi>Abel,</hi> and therefore ſhee rejoyceth in him, for a good Parent is little gladded in children, if they proove not pious and godly children, Gods children as well as his or hers; wherefore thoſe children that would glad the hearts of their Parents, muſt ſee themſelves to follow the waies of vertue, that their aged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may have joy in them.</p>
            <p>Now of <hi>Seth</hi> nothing is ſaid, but that he begat a Sonne at an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and five yeares old, as the next Chapter ſhewes, calling him <hi>Enoſh,</hi> that is, ſorrow or griefe, becauſe of the many griefes and ſorrowes to which men are ſubject in this life. Well may man have the name of ſorry given to him, ſo full of miſeries is he as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpake long after.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.26</note> Onely it is added, that in <hi>Seths daies men began to callon the name of the Lord.</hi> It may be rendred (ſome thinke) <hi>the name of God was prophaned in calling on,</hi> that is, men grew then very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane in a careleſſe abuſing Gods publike Service and Worſhip. Others thus, <hi>then it was begun to call on the name of the Lord,</hi> that is, men began more publikely and religiouſly and openly to call on the name of God, to profeſſe true piety more carefully in publike aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. It notes in the former ſence a growing worſe of the times, in the latter a growing better. I am in doubt whether ſence to faſten upon, I thinke rather of the twaine it is a taxing of the publike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of God in abuſing his worſhip, becauſe it followes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the giving of the name <hi>Enoſh,</hi> ſorrowfull, miſerable, mortall man, as a reaſon of that name, why did his Father call him ſo, becauſe Gods name then began to be prophaned in calling upon, men grew more and more careleſſe and remiſſe in Gods ſervice, and did it in ſo bad and negligent and indevout a faſhion, as it was rather a profaning then a worſhipping or honouring of his name. And this ſeemeth the rather to be the meaning, becauſe there is little reaſon to thinke that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> did not long before this apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the carefull worſhipping of God in their aſſemblies, and to take all good meanes to ſave themſelves from the corruption of the Kaynites. Or it may be rendered, <hi>then it was begun to call by the name of Lord,</hi> that is, men began then to have that name given them of the ſons of God, and this I like beſt of all the three, becauſe in the beginning of the ſixt Chapter (which continues the ſtory, and the fift Chapter is but a digreſſion put in to ſhew the age of the world at the floud) it is ſaid, <hi>the ſonnes of God ſaw the daughters of the ſonnes of men.</hi> Whereby it is apparent, that to the men that profeſſed true religion with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> the name of the ſonnes of God was given, and to the reſt the name of the ſonnes of men. The profeſſors of the true religion were called ſonnes of God, that did worſhip the true God after the manner that God taught by <hi>Adam.</hi> The other were called ſonnes of men, that gave themſelves over to worldlineſſe, and vanity, and prophaneneſſe; for my part I ſuppoſe that before the floud there was no Idolatry, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt would not have omitted the taxing of that ſinne as well as thoſe it doth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:27208:38"/>
taxe if it had beene then uſed in the world. But let us take the words to meane, <hi>then it was begun to call on the name of the Lord,</hi> and then it ſhall be added as a commendation of <hi>Seth,</hi> that in his daies religion began to flouriſh more then ever before, by his diligence joyning with his Father <hi>Adam,</hi> much more reſpect was had to piety, and greater numbers of men imbraced the profeſſion of piety. And this ought to be the care of every good man to further the progreſſe of true religion, and to cauſe the name of God to be faithfully called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many.</p>
            <p>Now of the reſt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſeed there is a Catalogue made in the fifth Chapter of all the ancient Fathers, from the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> in whoſe daies the floud fell out, by which it appeares of what ſtanding the world was, when it was growne ſo corrupt, that the Lord could no longer endure the manners of it. And in this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue the Holy Ghoſt takes this order; 1. He ſhewes of what age every one was when he begat his eldeſt ſonne. How many yeares he lived after the birth of that ſonne. 3. How old he was when he died. The number of the perſons are in all ten, <hi>Adam, Seth, Enoch, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Iared, Enoch, Methuſelah, Lamech,</hi> and <hi>Noah. Adam</hi> at a hundred and thirty yeares begat <hi>Seth,</hi> and after lived eight hundred yeares and had more children in that time, and died aged nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty yeares. <hi>Adam</hi> was in truth the eldeſt man all things conſidered, for though <hi>Methuſelah</hi> out-lived him thirty nine yeares (for he was nine hundred ſixty nine yeares, and <hi>Adam</hi> but nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty) yet <hi>Methuſelah</hi> was borne an infant, <hi>Adam</hi> was made a perfect man the firſt day, and in thoſe times a man was but a child at thirty nine yeares, for no queſtion they would give their mindes to marriage in that newneſſe of the world, paucity of men, and plenty of ground ſo ſoone as they were fit for it. So <hi>Adams</hi> perfect eſtate at the firſt countervailed the living of forty yeares and more. <hi>Seth</hi> he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a hundred and five yeares and begat <hi>Enos,</hi> and living eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeven yeares begat divers more children, and ended his daies at nine hundred and two. <hi>Enos</hi> lived ninety yeares and begat <hi>Cainan, &amp;c.</hi> as you may reade in the ſtory. Nothing is mentioned of any one but the length of his life, the time when hee had his firſt ſonne, and that hee had more ſonnes.<note place="margin">Henoch.</note> Onely of <hi>Henoch</hi> it is noted that he walked with God, that is, lived a moſt holy life and that he died not at all, but was tranſlated after hee had lived three hundred ſixty five yeares. The Lord ſhortned the daies of his pilgrimage, and rewarded his ſingular piety with taking him up to Heaven, ſoule and body immediately without dying. He was changed without any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating of his ſpirit from his body, and in him we have an example what ſhould have beene the courſe that God would have taken with all men if man had continued in the ſtate of innocency, <hi>viz.</hi> he ſhould not have died, ſoule and body ſhould never have departed one from the other, but after a man had proceeded in godlineſſe, till hee had gotten ſo large a meaſure of it, as in this life hee could (for though
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:27208:39"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> were perfect habitually yet not actually, I meane though hee had an ability to attaine perfect knowledge of God and the creatures, yet hee had not yet actually gotten all ſuch knowledge as hee was to get both of God and of the creatures) then ſhould he have beene tranſlated into Heaven to ſee God immediately and to know him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then in this life he could be knowne. Sinne entring cauſed death, had not that come in we ſhould have gone to Heaven without death as this <hi>Henoch</hi> did.</p>
            <p>Now out of all theſe things written concerning theſe Ancients the direct parents of our Lord, wee gather this, that death is common to all, and how long ſoever a man lives at laſt hee muſt leave the world, and therefore we learne two things principally.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to prepare for death, that whenſoever it befalleth wee may change for the better not for the worſe, and this preparation for death muſt be not alone a little before it comes, or at the houre of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, but in the whole courſe of our life by beginning early to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and continuing daily to turne and renew our repentance, that ſo we may get an aſſurance of our being taken from earth to Heaven: for he that begins unfaignedly to turne to God and ſo continues, hee ſhall ſurely be ſaved, and for the moſt part ſhall obtaine before his departure hence an aſſured apprehenſion of his ſalvation. Therefore hee muſt (as <hi>Henoch</hi> did) walke with God in a continuall care of obeying him, and labouring to hold faſt a conſtant perſwaſion of his favour and love to him in his Sonne, for it is teſtified of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.5.</note> ſo that what in <hi>Geneſis</hi> is called a <hi>walking with God,</hi> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>pleaſing of God,</hi> and alſo that by faith he was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death, even by his beleeving and reſting upon Gods mercy, for ſo it is ſaid, he beleeved that God was and was a <hi>rewarder of them that diligently ſeeke him,</hi> which finding himſelfe to do, he reſolved that God would reward him: So muſt each of us walke with God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reſolve and indeavour to pleaſe God in all things, and retaine in our ſelves an aſſured peaſwaſion, that God will graciouſly accept and reward us in Chriſt, with giving us life eternall and cauſing us never to ſee the ſecond death: though we muſt not be freed from the firſt, for that was the ſpeciall priviledge of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Eliah,</hi> and was never gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any other that we read. Labour therfore to hold faſt in your ſoules a firme perſwaſion of Gods love to you in Chriſt, and withall a firme purpoſe of pleaſing him in all things. Let ſincere truth of obedience be joyned with a firme perſwaſion of Gods love, and the firme perſwaſion of Gods love be joyned with a ſincere indeavour of obedience, then death ſhall never come amiſſe, then you are alwaies ready for it, So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> faith;<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.166.</note> 
               <hi>I have hoped in thy ſalvation and done thy Commandements.</hi> So then if we would be ready for God we muſt doe two things. Turne to him and walke with him. To turne is to begin to walke with God, to walke with God is to continue to turne to him. O ye that have not begun to turne doe it to day, turne now, call to mind your former evill waies to judge your ſelves for them, to lament them, to ſeeke of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:27208:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God in Chriſt forgiveneſſe of them and power againſt them, and labour to reſt your ſelves upon his goodneſſe in Chriſt for pardon and helpe, and ſo have you made your peace, then keepe your peace by a conſtant indeavour to pleaſe God in holineſſe of life, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant renewing of your aſſured perſwaſion of his love. O happy man he that can ſo fit himſelfe for his latter end. Brethren let the mention of the deaths of ſo many aged perſons, make you carefull to prepare for death; you that be young doe it, becauſe death takes away young men as well as old, and you that be old doe it, becauſe you may meete with it very ſuddenly, and muſt needs meete with it afore it be long.</p>
            <p>Againe, you ſee theſe long-liv'd men here, wreſtling with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the world and their owne, ſome a longer time and ſome a ſhorter, but all in compariſon of our ſelves a great while. The longeſt lived man for number of dayes was <hi>Methuſelah</hi> who lived nine hundred ſixty nine yeares, but for perfection of life <hi>Adam,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a perfect man nine hundred and thirty yeares. The ſhorteſt lived of all the Patriarkes was <hi>Noahs</hi> Father, <hi>Methuſelahs</hi> Sonne, <hi>Lamech,</hi> for he lived ſeven hundred ſeventy and ſeven yeares, and died the yeere before the floud, a little before his Father <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till that very yeare that the floud came and drowned all, and was taken away that he might not ſee the floud.</p>
            <p>Now why did God lengthen out the daies of the Patriarkes?<note place="margin">Why the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes lived ſo long.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, chiefely to maintaine the knowledge of God and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the world, that by the long life of one godly man, the truth which then was not put in writing, but by word of mouth delivered from man to man might be kept more pure and undefiled. <hi>Adam</hi> lived till <hi>Methuſelah</hi> was two hundred forty and three yeares old. <hi>Methuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> lived till <hi>Sem</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Noah</hi> was one hundred yeares lacking two; ſo that <hi>Sem</hi> talked with him that had talked with <hi>Adam,</hi> who could acquaint him with all things concerning the creatures, the fall and the promiſed ſeed out of his certaine knowledge and experience, he had beene made of nothing, he had ſeene all perfections, and <hi>Methuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> could tell it to <hi>Sem,</hi> and <hi>Sem</hi> lived to ſee <hi>Iſaac</hi> borne and a Father. So that <hi>Iſaac</hi> might ſpeake mouth to mouth with him that had ſpoken with him that had ſpoken with <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man that ever was.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee have propounded particular Examples unto you hitherto, as alſo the Scriptures have done. Now following them, wee muſt ſet before your eyes the Examples of an whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, even of an whole World, full of men and women, that gave themſelves to worke wickedneſſe before the Lord. It is called in Scripture, <hi>the old World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5.</note> and <hi>the world of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi> In the ſpace of a 1656. yeares the generation of mankind was growne to that height and exorbitancie of wickedneſſe, that the patience of God could no longer endure them.</p>
            <p>Now concerning this Old World we will ſhew you three things. 1. Their ſinnes. 2. The goodneſſe of God to them notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their ſinnes. 3. The ſevere puniſhment that fell upon them at the laſt, and ſo will make uſe of all.<note place="margin">The ſinnes of the old world. 1. In generall.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, for their ſinnes, the Holy Ghoſt ſets them out in generall, and more particularly. In generall, <hi>the ſinne of man</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>great,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note>
and that <hi>every imagination of the thought of his heart was evill and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evill and that continually.</hi> Secondly, it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Verſe 11.</note> 
               <hi>that all fleſh had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:27208:41"/>
his way upon the earth.</hi> So their naughtineſſe was remarkeable in theſe two reſpects, it was exceeding hainous and grievous in that they committed great and fowle ſinnes, in great abundance with great wilfullneſſe, and gave themſelves to add ſinne to ſinne, doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but plodding and contriving wickedneſſe,<note place="margin">They all were given over to ſinning, except ſome in <hi>Noahs</hi> houſe.</note> and then all men gave themſelves over to the ſame bad courſe; you could not finde a man that made ſcarce a ſhew of goodneſſe out of <hi>Noahs</hi> houſe. When all conſent together to ſell over themſelves to worke iniquity, and grow paſt ſhame or feare, running into moſt grievous and notorious ſinnes with greedineſſe and wilfullneſſe, this is very offenſive to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and will certainely provoke his wrath to bring upon them ſome fearefull and heavie puniſhments.</p>
            <p>Divers reaſons may be thought of that cauſed this exceeding great growth of ſinne in thoſe times.<note place="margin">Why ſinne was ſo great then.</note> 1. The long life of men, for let an unſanctified man continue long, and he will grow more and more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the longer he continues. Sinne by frequent exerciſe growes more and more violent and head-ſtrong. So living a great ſpace of time they grew above meaſure naught.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They had ſtrong and able bodies together with health and ability to enjoy the things of this life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They had great peace in regard they all lived under a paternall governement, the agedſt in the family ſtill being acknowledged the governour of the family, and they had all one language and ſo no great cauſe of controverſie, and one religion too, it is like, ſeeing the Patriarkes lived ſo long, that they were immediately taught of God, ſave that they degenerated to prophaneneſſe and the moſt became of no religion, and ſo did not warre with the contrary little partie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were with jeſts, ſcoffes and contumelies. Long life, great ſtrength, great peace begat great wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. In particular.</note>But more particularly the Lord takes notice here of their 1. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and carnall marriages, 2. Of their violence and oppreſſion. And our Saviour telleth of their great worldlineſſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.37, 38.</note> that did ſell over themſelves to temporall dealings, and cared nothing for better things; and S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells of their obſtinacy in ſinning, and their not beleeving nor regarding,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.20.</note> 
               <hi>they were diſobedient whileſt the long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God waited in the daies of Noah.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 24.38.</note> Yea our Saviour telleth of their notable unbeleefe, that did not give any credit to Gods threats, nor knew of the floud till the waters came and drowned them. All <hi>Noahs</hi> preaching prevailed nor to make them take notice of the judgement that hanged over their heads.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Gods mercy to them.</note>The mercy of God towards them appeareth, in that he gave them a large warning, a hundred and twenty yeares to repent, in which his Spirit continued to ſtrive with their wickedneſſe, God taketh to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the ſimilitude of a man, who being greatly diſpleaſed with the ill carriage of his Inferiours, is faine to ſtrive with himſelfe to keepe downe his anger, that it raiſe not up it ſelfe againſt them in exceſſe and over-ſuddenly. The ſtriving of Gods Spirit is a patient continuing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:27208:41"/>
to uſe the meanes of reclaiming ſinners, to ſee if it be poſſible to winne them, Gods bounty taketh paines as it were to breake mans ſinfull heart. So God reſolved to continue ſtriving but for a hundred and twenty yeares, and all that while he determined to continue this courſe of gentleneſſe, and withall hee uſed in that time the miniſtery of <hi>Noah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5.</note> who was therefore called a Miniſter and Preacher of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that he might reduce them to ſome repentance and amendment; therefore is it ſaid,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.20.</note> 
               <hi>The long-ſuffering of God waited in</hi> Noahs <hi>daies,</hi> and in all this ſpace they had great outward mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Yea there were men of great ſtature borne which prooved alſo men of great renowne for wealth, riches, honours and outward emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, ſo that they felt no manner of puniſhment almoſt in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, but were reſerved to that great and heavie puniſhment which waited for them at laſt, even to the deluge or floud of waters.</p>
            <p>God made all the great deepes to breake up,<note place="margin">Their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and the ſprings to over-flow, ſo that the waters guſhed up from the ground, and then opened the windowes of Heaven, and cauſed all the waters from above to fall downe, till at length the raine continuing for the ſpace of forty daies,<note place="margin">The Deluge.</note> and the waters finding ſo violent an iſſue upwards, the whole earth and all the higheſt mountaines were covered with water fifteene cubits, that is, a cubit being coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for halfe a yard, ſeven yards and an halfe high, to the cutting off of all the ſonnes and daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of all the birds and beaſts that could not live in the water, ſave thoſe few that were in the Arke with <hi>Noah,</hi> who beſides his preaching by the ſigne, of building the Arke did warne them but all in vaine of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing floud.</p>
            <p>So you have the ſumme of the ſtory of the old World in their ſinfullneſſe, and Gods forbearance for along time, and Gods ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and their miſery at the laſt. Let us make due uſes now of all.<note place="margin">The uſes of all.</note> For the chiefe thing in ſuch ſtories as theſe is to make a good uſe, becauſe theſe are ſet forth for an Example to them that ſhall hereafter live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlily. For their ſoules alſo periſhed eternally as well as their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for anything that can be learn'd out of Scripture to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, except that we may conceive, the Lord might be mercifull to the ſoules of infants, that were not of age to make uſe of the meanes that ſhould have brought the reſt to repentance, nor did not runne to the ſame extremity of wickedneſſe, unleſſe I ſay wee may hope in charity that God would ſhew compaſſion on the ſoules of theſe, the men of yeeres periſh ſoule and body both. Now what uſes muſt wee make, 1. Of their ſinnes, 2. Of Gods patience, 3. Of Gods ſeverity. Of their ſinnes we muſt make divers uſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to take notice of our owne corrupt nature that is ready to grow ſo extreamely naught. For wee alſo are the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> and have the ſame corruption of nature that theſe had, and our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and the forme and frame of our hearts and all our thoughts
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27208:42"/>
will be onely evill continually, if God give us to ourſelves, and there is not one of us that would not grow unjuſt, voluptuous, worldly, violent, and moſt extreamely wicked in every kinde of wickedneſſe, as occaſion would offer it ſelfe, if the Lord did not hold us backe, either by reſtraining or ſanctifying, or both. To him let us give the praiſe of our being reſtrained or ſanctified, and let us confeſſe his goodneſſe that doth not give us over to all licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe, to commit all wickedneſſe with greedineſſe. An hearty praiſing of God for delivering us from notorious ſinfullneſſe, is a teſtimony of ſome grace. Mans heart is apt to turne ſuch freedome into matter of ſwelling and ſelfe-conceitedneſſe, if our leſſe badneſſe makes us more thankefull and humble not haughty and arrogant, it is a ſigne of ſome truth of goodneſſe. But innocency joyned with ſwelling, lifting up our ſelves and deſpiſing others, is no better then that of the Phariſee. This is the firſt uſe of their ſin.</p>
            <p>The next is to teach us to take heed of ſuch wickedneſſe, that great ſinnes may not grow common, but that there may be ſome to oppoſe the reſt, ſome to mourne for the reſt, and to take care of keeping themſelves unſpotted in the world, that ſo great and publike puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be kept back. Let us every way ſtrive to cauſe that ſinnes grow not huge and univerſall, that they come not to an high degree and to commonneſſe, ſo that all joyne in them; for then likely ſome great and heavy calamity muſt inſue. With us ſinnes do grow very great, great faults are committed by many, but yet we are to praiſe God that all fleſh hath not corrupted their waies, there be ſome though but few in compariſon of the multitude, yet I ſay ſome, that ſet themſelves againſt the great and common iniquities, which may give us ſome hope, that the Lords chaſtiſements ſhall follow us one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for reformation, not for utter extirpation of the Nation. Let us all uſe our beſt diligence to hinder the greatneſſe and commonneſſe of ſinne, that wee may prevent deſtroying and all-devouring blowes.</p>
            <p>A third uſe from their ſinnes is that we be carefull to avoid theſe particular ſinnes, or to repent of them and to reforme them, if wee have committed them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take great heed of making carnall marriages with perſons ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and wicked for beauties ſake, or any ſuch carnall reſpect. For if it offend God that men be lewd to take wives voide of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and piety becauſe of their faireneſſe, then ſurely to be ſo farre over-ruled with gaine or any other earthly conſideration, as for theſe things ſake to make matches with carnall and naughty men muſt needs offend God. Let no man doe ſo therefore, let piety I ſay piety be the match-maker, let beauty, riches, and all ſuch things come after in the ſecond or third place, and let no man for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of face, faire ſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> marrie themſelves to foule conditions, foule manners, falſe religion, wicked converſation. Surely that which ſwayes a man moſt in matrimony, ſwayes him moſt in his whole
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:27208:42"/>
life, this being one of the maine matters that concerne him in his life. If godlineſſe and religion be not of force to command us in this thing it cannot be conceived that we have any ſound knowledge of it, and if outward things ſway us moſt here, they have the ſoveraignty and dominion of our hearts. Shew your ſelves ſpirituall in choice of yoke-fellowes, if you will enjoy the comfort of being ſo in good earneſt and in ſincerity. And if any have done otherwiſe, O let them be much humbled, it is a great fault an hazarding of ones ſelfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or of his children, a ſigne that one doth not rightly know neither ſinne or goodneſſe, if in this matter wickedneſſe cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace all other things, and vertue over-ballance all other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if God have made ſuch a match very diſmall and unhappie to any one, and that they have found theſe things unable to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and with theſe they have beene turned aſide from the right way; let them acknowledge the juſtice of God and turne the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments into a meanes of unfained repentance for the ſinne. It is juſt with God to croſſe mens falſe opinions of things, and make them meete with wretchedneſſe, where they did falſely and unwarrantably promiſe to themſelves contentment, as they doe moſt times in ſuch kinde of ill made marriages. If any good man have ſo tranſgreſſed, he is now called to repentance for it, by Gods hand croſſing, and Gods Word warning him.</p>
            <p>Againe, beware I pray you of the next ſinne, <hi>viz.</hi> unjuſtice and violence, that is, taking away the goods of others by ſtrong hand, whether by manifeſt violence, or by violent wreſting and abuſing of law through ſtrength of wit, or purſe, or both. To take away that from another by any manner of ſtrength which is his in right that is violence. God hath often in his Word ſpoken againſt this,<note place="margin">Violence what it is. A great ſin.</note> for the waters of the floud have not yet waſhed it out, but it hath place in the world ſtill. Thoſe that are ſtronger then others will wrench and pull, and make a ſhift to tug all they can unto themſelves, though they have no right unto ſuch things, covetouſneſſe and greedy deſires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get oppreſſion to ſatisfie ſuch an unſatisfiable deſire; <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.9. that <hi>hee hath ſeene violence in the citie,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Him that loves violence his ſoule hateth.</hi> By violence men tread underfoot the light of nature, and bury their reaſon in paſſion and under it. It is the property of beaſts to be lead by will and paſſion, what they deſire to have if they can poſſibly get it by any device or power they will have it, rules of right they acknowledge none nor can acknowledge, becauſe they want reaſon, which is the ſole diſtinguiſher betwixt right and wrong. But man that hath reaſon which can ſet downe limits and bounds to every mans poſſeſſions and benefits, ſhould follow his reaſon and not take ſo much as his hand can reach and pull unto it ſelfe, but alone that which he findes the rules of equity to give him. He that doth otherwiſe doth infinitely treſpaſſe upon Gods Royalty over the whole world, for he doth not carrie himſelfe in this great family according to the will of him that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:27208:43"/>
is the ſole maker and maſter of it, and ſo lives as if himſelfe were Maſter and chiefe Lord, and not bound to any rules but thoſe of his owne will. Violence therefore is a grievous ſinne. It will bring Gods curſe, and anger, and hatred upon the committer. A violent man is odious in the world and in Heaven too, his love of himſelfe makes him i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jurious to all, and therefore alſo loathſome. Flie violence therefore either of hand or head, and take nothing but what in true right you can prove to be your owne, and if you have gotten any thing by violence, repent of it, and rid your hands of it, elſe the hand of God ſhall be heavie upon you for it, he will bring your violence upon your owne pates.</p>
            <p>And know I beſeech you, that as there be two ſorts of violent beaſts ſo of men. You know there be Lions, and Beares, and Tigers, and great creatures that prey upon the weaker as upon the Sheepe, the Cowe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then there be little beaſts too that prey upon the leſſer, as the Weezle on the Mouſe and on Chickens, and ſuch like that be leſſer then themſelves. So there be two ſorts of violent men too, the great and wealthie man, and the poore and meaner man. The one can beare out his violence openly, and doth it in greater things. The other doth it more cloſely and in leſſer things, but both will have what equity doth not give them by one or other ſhift or wile, or act of his hand. And truly as great wickedneſſe is found in poore men this way as in the wealthier. He that is as bad as his place will ſuffer, is as wicked a man as another that in higher place is more apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked. Give the Weezle the fangs and limmes of a Lion, hee will doe as much miſchiefe as a Lion. Therefore <hi>the poore robbing the poore</hi> is compared to a <hi>ſweeping raine that leaveth no food,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 28.3.</note> and none more violent then theſe little violent ones when they can tell how to make way and beare out their violence, will not you ſee it evidently in the boldneſſe of the poorer ſort to ſteale corne at this time of the yeare. He that will pull a piece of ones ſheafe from him, if hee were a great Prince of name and power, would pull his whole living from him. Beware therefore of thoſe unjuſt waies of getting which are under your hands, and in your powers incident to your places, repent of them, ſhun them, and forbeare them for conſcience ſake, that you may not provoke Gods wrath againſt you.</p>
            <p>Further, the men of this time were extreamely worldly as our Lord Jeſus noteth, they ſold over themſelves to the world, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not for <hi>Noahs</hi> preaching, nor for any thing that might concerne their ſoules, but ſold over themſelves to earthly dealing as you reade in <hi>Luke</hi> 17.26, 27. O be not many of you ſuch, are not your hearts fully poſſeſſed with all earthlineſſe. Doe not you ſet your ſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to the things of this life with the meere neglect of that which concernes a better. Surely thoſe that doe ſo are in heart Atheiſts, they doe not thoroughly beleeve that immortality of the ſoule, nor the being of another world. For were every mans heart
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:27208:43"/>
fully perſwaded that his ſoule ſhould continue for ever in another world either in eternall weale or woe, it were not poſſible for him not to conſider of the eſtate to come as well as of the ſtate preſent, if we did as well know and beleeve that there is an Hell and Heaven, as that there is an earth and in it miſery and welfare, we could not but be as ſtudious to get the future happineſſe and eſcape the future miſery as the preſent. I pray you therefore ſtrive againſt that ſinne of the old World, <hi>viz.</hi> giving up your ſelves exceſſively to the world, and put your ſelves in minde of a world that is to come, and minde the things that are above and ſet your affections on them. If you ſo performe workes of Gods Worſhip, as that they weane you not from the world, you doe them but hypocritically, you have alone the forme and not the power of godlineſſe. Though a man uſe not violence, yet if hee be exceſſively worldly the Word of God is choaked in him, and will not bring forth the fruit of eternall life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>Another ſin of the old World is,<note place="margin">4 Diſobedient. 1 Pet. 3.20. The floud came upon them and they knew nothing.</note> they abuſed Gods long-ſuffering and <hi>Noahs</hi> preaching, and gat no manner of knowledge of the long threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned floud, nor no care of amending their lives. This is a fearefull thing to get nothing by Gods patience or by the labours of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters whom he ſends to teach and warne us. This ſhewes that the Divell ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h blinded their eyes, that ſinne hath hardened the heart, and that a man hath given over himſelfe to the ſervitude of ſome luſt: this is a great wrong to Gods goodneſſe and authority both, and it brings ſevere puniſhments, for in aggravating the ſinnes of men it muſt needs aggravate the puniſhment alſo. O brethren conſider of your ſelves if you be not guilty of this ſinne. How long hath God beene ſtriving to pull you out of your ſinnes. How much patience hath he ſhewed; how much teaching have you heard, and yet alas the old World got as much by Gods kindneſſe to them as you doe and you no more then they. Many of you know nothing of your miſerable eſtate. As little be you acquainted with the truths you are taught every day, as they were with the floud that came upon them, as little doth our preaching prevaile to worke you to amendment, as did the preaching of <hi>Noah</hi> with them. We may well comfort our ſelves in this, that our ſucceſſe is no worſe then <hi>Noahs,</hi> and alſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it is no better. Indeed you have not had ſo many yeeres preaching as the <note n="*" place="margin">120.</note> old World had, but conſider it with the proportion to your lives and you have more. Then men uſed to live ſome ſeven, eight, or nine hundred yeeres. Loe God gave them a Preacher a long time, and at length determined the very yeere of the floud, it ſhall be a hundred and twenty yeeres hence, and ſo from yeare to yeare leſſe as the yeeres went up. Yee have lived and died (many of you that be dead) under the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Indeed we cannot tell you the yeere of your death, or bring you tidings of a floud of water to overflow you altogether, but of a river of fire and brimſtone to overflow and overwhelme you one after one
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:27208:44"/>
wee can tell you from God, and you feare this floud of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone no more then they did that floud of water. O repent of your long impenitency and miſerable unbeleefe and wilfull igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods threats, and other things that are continually taught you out of the Word. And now ceaſe to imitate this world of ungodly men, but apply your ſelves to flie from the wrath to come and from the vengeance that muſt overtake all wilfull ſinners. I beſeech you lay to heart the things you heare, take notice of them, beleeve them, and ſet your ſelves to amend your lives and caſt away all your ſinnes, which this old World did not but ſhould have done: be better I ſay be better then they were, and let their wickedneſſe teach you ſome goodneſſe. When will it once be that you will know and beleeve the threats of God and his promiſes? when will it once be that you will ſubmit your ſelves to thoſe that are as <hi>Noah</hi> was, Preachers of righteouſneſſe, and ſeeke to get the righteouſneſſe of faith, which <hi>Noah</hi> would not have gotten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if it had not beene the ſame that hee preached to others? Now I pray you at laſt to exceede this generation of wicked men. And theſe uſes you muſt make of their wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now of Gods patience towards them in giving them all outward proſperity and long deferring the execution of his wrath, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Noah</hi> by preaching and building the Arke to draw them to repentance; learne firſt to praiſe God for the like long-ſuffering to us, and uſing the like meanes to bring us to repentance and to life eternall. It is the ſame God that ruled the world at thoſe times who ruleth us alſo at this time, and he diſcovers the ſame vertues in his governing. O how patient is God now alſo? how great care doth he take to leade us to repentance alſo? How many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward benefits have wee? This goodneſſe of God towards them that periſh, whereby he tooke ſuch order and care for them, that they might have eſcaped perdition if they would have made uſe of his meanes is not ſufficiently heeded nor obſerved. Might not the world then have eſcaped both drowning and hell too, if they would have hearkened to <hi>Noah</hi> and beleeved him, and followed his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. Did any thing but their owne wilfullneſſe and heedleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhut them out of the Arke and out of Heaven, and thruſt them downe into the Deluge and into Hell? Brethren, God magnifies his mercies to the veſſells of wrath, he doth labour to bring them out of their ill eſtate, he hath not ceaſed for many yeares to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice them to repentance by his long-ſuffering. Certainely this ſhould magnifie Gods goodneſſe to us and make us to applaud him exceedingly, and acknowledge the brightneſſe of his Juſtice in their future deſtruction. O how juſt was God in the drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe men? is hee not as juſt in the damning of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner now? Lord be thou praiſed for thy mercy and forthy juſtice, and let the one ſerve to cleare the other, and both to commend thee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:27208:44"/>Againe, I pray you now the the ſecond time to make a good uſe of Gods clemencie to you. He ſent but one <hi>Noah</hi> to all the world, who yet is ſaid to condemne the world. He ſends amongſt you to every towne almoſt one to tell you of the judgement to come, and to ſtirre you up to repentance. Now be intreated to hearken and obey, and to get you to the Arke. Brethren wee doe here in Gods name offer you aſſurance of pardon of ſinne, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from hell and death, if you will accept it, O let not our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching be in vaine. Come, come into the Arke, come into Chriſt by true faith, into whom you are come by Baptiſme in reſpect of outward profeſſion. The Arke was a figure of Chriſt, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is as it were the Arke: O labour for the true Baptiſme with the Spirit that you may ſhunne and eſcape the Deluge of Gods eternall wrath and vengeance. Let us not preach to you in vaine as <hi>Noah</hi> did to the old world. And preſent to your ſelves the hideouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that plague, O how did mens hearts ake within them? how did horrour take hold upon them, when they ſaw the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters rage ſo furiouſly? O now did they find that in experience which they would not beleeve by <hi>Noahs</hi> preaching! What cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what roaring, what lamentation did fill the Cities and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? they did not die of a ſudden as in the overflowing of the Sea, but they died by degrees, they had time to get up upon hills and trees, and to foreſee and fore-feare their choaking by waters afore it came, and to ſee the Beaſts many periſhing before them, many looking for the ſame ruine with them. Doth not this floud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to you? Doth not it pertaine to you alſo? Doe you not here ſee, 1. The Omnipotent power of God, and his abſolute and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne command over all creatures. The Sea and Springs are his and will breake out upon us. The Cloudes and Waters above are his and will fall downe upon us to revenge his quarrell. He is Lord of Hoſts, O plant in your ſelves an holy feare of him, and ſay to your ſelves, ſhall he threaten and not performe, who hath the whole world at hand to be ſerviceable unto him. If we would repreſent the Lord before our eyes according to his fearefull greatneſſe, ſo as to make us tremble and depart from ſinne, happie were wee. Doth not Chriſt ſend us to the old World, and doth not <hi>Peter</hi> alſo minde us of this deſtruction by water. Surely the Lord is a terrible God ſtill, he is now as terrible, as he ſhewed himſelfe then in the overthrow by waters.</p>
            <p>Againe, you muſt in this plague ſee the juſtice of God, his will to puniſh ſinners by inflicting great evill upon them, that ſo you may yet make the feare of him the more ſtedfaſt and more effectuall, for as hee is of power to cruſh the higheſt and ſtouteſt and thoſe of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt power in the world, ſo he is reſolved upon this courſe, and will ſurely declare his excellency by making them ſmoake with moſt heavie calamities, that dare advance themſelves againſt his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. See here how ſevere God is, he will not ſpare the wicked, he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:27208:45"/>
will not hold them innocent, though he deferre many daies, yet will the heavineſſe of the ſtroake anſwer the delay. The floud was long a comming, but being come it's furious and irreſiſtible, and wipes out all the ſonnes of men ſparing none. The Lord can finde in his heart to execute hideous evills upon ſinners. Let them if they pleaſe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie a God wholy conſiſting of mercy, they ſhall find him ſuch as his Word deſcribeth, not as they themſelves have counterfeited, hee will recompence vengeance on his Adverſaries, hee will not pitie their cries nor groanes. Hee will not be melted with their complaints, but utterly deſtroy them according as his Word hath ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Behold alſo the equity of Gods proceeding, hee anſwers their ſinnes with the kinde and meaſure of puniſhment. Great ſinnes and great waters. All fleſh corrupted with ſinne, and all fleſh cut off for ſinne, the earth filled with violence and now filled with waters. None tooke care to forbeare almoſt any ſinne but <hi>Noah,</hi> and none eſcapes but <hi>Noah.</hi> No multitude of ſinners can ſave them out of his hand, as all ſinned ſo all periſh. This great and heavie judgement ſhould be often in our thoughts,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5.</note> we ſhould thinke thus, <hi>if God ſpared not the old World neither will bee ſpare us.</hi> It is S. <hi>Peters</hi> inference, and it is a great ſinne in us, that we doe not often put our ſelves in minde of theſe things to frame our ſelves to humble obedience.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, but God hath promiſed never againe to deſtroy the world by water.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 9.11.</note>I anſwer, true, but he hath never promiſed not to drowne ſinners, neither hath he promiſed not to puniſh them with puniſhments as fearefull as this of periſhing by waters. God hath great variety of weapons to wound his enemies; if he hath renounced the uſe of one, he hath others enough to take up for that purpoſe. And Brethren, I pray you take notice of what S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us of, <hi>That as the world that then was did periſh being drowned in the waters,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.6, 7.</note> ſo the world that now is ſhall periſh by fire,</hi> for he telleth us, that <hi>it is by the ſame word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for fire kept in ſtore againſt the time to come.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jude verſe 14.</note> The Prophet <hi>Enoch</hi> foretold of that great day before <hi>Noah</hi> foretold of this deluge. That day is longer before it come, but it ſhall be more terrible when it comes,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.10.</note> for <hi>the heavens ſhall paſſe away with a noiſe,</hi> as the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells you. Now as the righteous <hi>Noah</hi> ſhewed a way how to eſcape that water, even repent and get into the Arke, ſo we ſhew away how to eſcape that fire, repent and turne unto the Lord, otherwiſe when he ſhall come in flames of fire, you ſhall receive the judgement of eternall deſtruction from before the preſence of his glory.</p>
            <p>Brethren, I beſeech you ſo to ponder upon that great miſery which fell upon the old World, that you may be the better for knowing all the paſſages of ſo ſtrange a ſtory. It was the firſt remarkeable judgement. No generall calamity that we reade of did come upon the world till then. The firſt and laſt acts of juſtice will be moſt ſevere, and the laſt likely ſeverer then the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:27208:45"/>The Lord gave to the men of this old World a very long life, and very great outward benefits, and ſhewed to them exceeding great long-ſuffering, why ſo? but becauſe he would firſt, as he delighteth to do, proove men with benefits. As if he ſhould have ſaid, I will proove <hi>Adams</hi> ſonnes with the fruites of my favour. They ſhall have time enough to repent, ſome eight or nine hundred yeares, and they ſhall be allured by all proſperity, nothing but comforts ſhall come upon them for a long time, but if they will not profit by this gentleneſſe, I will ſhorten their lives by halfe, having taken away all thoſe fearefull ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by a floud of waters.

                  <hi>Noah</hi> what it ſignifieth.</note> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.29. <hi>This ſame ſhall comfort us concerning our worke and the toyle of our hands, becauſe of the ground which the Lord hath curſed.</hi> It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtfull how <hi>Noah</hi> was a comforter to the godly Patriarckes In reſpect of their troubles of all kinds, both thoſe they tooke in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving againſt the bad men of their times, and the common labours of life in regard of the curſe that was gon out againſt mans ſinne. The moſt probable opinion is as I thinke, that becauſe he was a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of righteouſneſſe, and did more largely and plainely denounce Gods wrath againſt ſinners, and his bleſſing to the godly (for a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of righteouſneſſe muſt needs doe both theſe things) therefore
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:27208:47"/>
he gave much refreſhing to the ſoules of the godly, and made all their labours eaſie. Even as now if Gods people have a painefull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter amongſt them, that ceaſeth not to acquaint them with Gods mercy and juſtice, and to revive the remembrance of Heaven and all the Promiſes in their hearts, they live much more comfortably, then any outward thing without this helpe could make them to live. So it was in thoſe times alſo with thoſe godly Patriarkes. Againe, as it would be a great comfort to good men now, if any man were ſent by God to aſſure them of the laſt day of judgement, for they would even lift up their heads and rejoyce: ſo <hi>Noah</hi> in telling of the floud which to that world was a kinde of judgement-day did greatly ſolace the ſpirits of the good againſt all their ſorrowes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His Birth.</note>Now this <hi>Noah</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Lamech</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Methuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> in the 1056. yeare of the world. He was the tenth after <hi>Adam</hi> incluſively, borne after. <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Seths</hi> death, and <hi>Henochs</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, and lived to ſee the death of <hi>Enos, Kainan, Mahalaleel, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Methuſelah</hi> and <hi>Lamech.</hi> This is all we have to ſay of his Birth or entrance into the world.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His life.</note>Now concerning his life I pray you conſider foure things, 1. His goodneſſe. 2. His bad deeds. 3. The ſorrowes and miſeries he met with. 4. The benefits God gave him. And let us make uſe of all as we goe along and ſo come to his death laſt of all.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">In which 1. His vertues. 1. In generall. Was a perfect man and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with God. Gen. 5 22. Heb. 11.4.</note>Firſt for his goodneſſe, it is ſet forth in the Scripture generally and particularly. In generall theſe three things are affirmed of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. <hi>He was a juſt man and upright,</hi> or perfect, <hi>and walked with God.</hi> Before it is affirmed of <hi>Henoch</hi> that <hi>hee walked with God,</hi> and the Scripture told us alſo of <hi>Abel,</hi> that hee obtained a divine teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that hee alſo was juſt, and <hi>Iob</hi> is ſaid to have beene a perfect man, yea it is added by way of amplification to his goodneſſe that hee was <hi>a juſt man and perfect in his generations,</hi> that is, in his owne time, in thoſe moſt ſinfull daies when all were naught. <hi>Noah</hi> was good when all had corrupted their waies, he was ſincere and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in his waies. For this is the trueſt commendation of vertue, when it keepes a man unſpotted of thoſe evils which are every where practiſed in the world.</p>
            <p>Let us now requeſt you to conſider of your ſelves every man whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a <hi>Noah.</hi> Surely none but <hi>Noahs</hi> ſhall be admitted into the Arke, and eſcape the waves of deſtruction: none but <hi>Noahs</hi> ſhall finde favour with God, and be delivered from eternall death. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever cannot approve himſelfe to be ſuch a one as this good man, let him never dreame of comming to Heaven.</p>
            <p>But who is a juſt man? who a perfect? who walketh with God?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Who is a juſt or righteous man.</note>I anſwer, A juſt man is firſt he that renounceth his owne juſtice which is of the Law and imbraceth the righteouſneſſe of faith, even the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith, relying wholy upon the merits of Chriſt and Gods mercy in Chriſt, for pardon
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:27208:47"/>
of his offences and acceptation of himſelfe and his indeavours to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The Scripture witneſſeth that <hi>Noah</hi> was an heire of this righteouſneſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. And this is that that muſt be firſt found in every man. He muſt ſee and confeſſe his owne unrighteouſneſſe, and utterly diſclaime his owne righteouſneſſe as knowing that it is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a menſtruous rag, in reſpect of his juſtification. Doe you this my Brethren? Are you made to ſee your ſelves grievous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſuch as in your ſelves muſt needs be damned, and cannot poſſibly bee ſaved by the worth and merit of your owne good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a righteous man muſt ſtay, reſt, depend on, beleeve in the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, labouring to build up in his own heart a particular perſwaſion and aſſurance, that the Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will accept him as perfectly righteous in the name and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt his Sonne, and that alone,<note place="margin">Rom 4.</note> for ſo was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> made partaker of that bleſſedneſſe, which ſtood in the imputing unto him of righteouſneſſe without workes, and <hi>Abraham</hi> is the Father of the faithfull, as he was juſtified ſo muſt all we be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and no otherwiſe. See into your ſelves, doe you rely upon our bleſſed Saviour the Lord Jeſus for pardon of your ſinnes? or doe you waver from him or ſtay upon any other beſides him?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, a righteous man muſt himſelfe alſo worke righteouſneſſe, and give himſelfe to be a ſervant of righteouſneſſe, that is to ſay, he muſt reſolve and indeavour to leave every ſinne by Gods Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and to doe every duty by Gods Word commanded, and that alſo for Gods ſake with reference to him, and out of a deſire to pleaſe him, that is, to keepe his favour. This is a righteous man. He ſtrives in all things to pleaſe God according to his Word, but fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his defects bewailes them, and reſteth alone on Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Chriſt for pardon and ſalvation. If you be ſuch, then are you <hi>Noahs</hi> indeed and ſhall ſurely bee ſaved, if not you bee but diſſemblers, and no ſhew of religion ſhall ſave you from deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Therefore all of you that are not ſuch, I pray you feele your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe, you are not good enough to goe to Heaven yet, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you have imagined of your ſelves. Therefore alſo now ſeeke to be ſuch, begin with lamenting your unrighteouſneſſe before God and craving pardon and helpe, and ſo proceed to pray for and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after all the things before preſcribed. Be the better for <hi>Noahs</hi> example. Let not this ſtory be preached unto you in vaine: you know <hi>Noah</hi> was one whom God loved, whom God hath ſaved, ſtudy to be ſuch as <hi>Noah.</hi> What riches he had, the Scripture takes no notice of, but righteous he was, ſtudie you to be ſuch and be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier then all riches can make you.</p>
            <p>And eſpecially I pray you labour to follow <hi>Noah</hi> in this onething, to be good in your generations, in thoſe things I meane wherein your preſent times take generall liberty to be nought, that ſo you as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:27208:48"/>
               <hi>Noah</hi> may at once glorifie God and condemne the world. What evill things all doe commit thoſe doe you forbeare, what good things all doe neglect, thoſe be you more carefull to performe. Many things are growne into common faſhion, ſwearing, pride in apparell, formality in religion, covetouſneſſe, monſtrous faſhions, miſhapen long haire, O be yee in theſe things carefull to avoid the corruption which is in the world. Many good things are growne quite out of all faſhion almoſt, conſtant reading Gods Word, holy confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, keeping a treaſure or purſe for God in your houſes, meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Word, and carefull ſanctifying of the Lords day. O ſtrive to performe theſe duties. He that is good alone according to the common ſtreyne is hollowly good, wee muſt be pure of thoſe faults which are allowed almoſt of all.</p>

            <p>And againe, I call upon you for great thankfullneſſe to God, for that he hath ſet many Preachers of righteouſneſſe amongſt you in this Kingdome, and hath vouchſafed to hold mee in this office amongſt you for theſe thirty yeares or thereabouts, I have Preached righteouſneſſe among you according to that meaſure of knowledge and utterance that God hath vouchſafed mee.

            <p>But ſecondly, <hi>Noah</hi> is commended for his faith.<note place="margin">2. Had faith Heb. 11.7.</note> 
               <hi>By faith Noah</hi> (ſaith the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>) <hi>did, &amp;c.</hi> you muſt all labour to get this ſame faith. This is the grace of graces commended in <hi>Abel,</hi> in <hi>Henoch</hi> before named, and now in <hi>Noah,</hi> without which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>But what is this faith you will aske mee?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, I will ſhew the nature of faith unto you:<note place="margin">What faith is.</note> It is that grace by which a man aſſents to all that God ſpeaketh for the authority ſake of the ſpeaker. This is the nature of faith in generall. Under it is comprehended that which is called juſtifying faith, being an aſſent to the Promiſes of the Goſpell, or of the new Covenant upon the ſame ground. This aſſent is double, firſt generall to the word generally ſpoken, and particular to a particular concluſion duely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted thence concerning ones ſelfe. And whoſoever doth truly aſſent to the generall, muſt needs aſſent to every particular concluded under the generall, becauſe the contradiction of an univerſall propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is made by a particular contrary to it, and the generall is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted falſe if it may be denied or be denied of any particular, for Example, if I ſay all the twelve Apoſtles were godly men, and another ſay one of them as <hi>Iudas,</hi> was not a godly man, though a eleven were good, yet becauſe this one was not ſo, he hath ſhewed that propoſition to be falſe. Now then, marke that faith yeelds a double aſſent: Firſt, to the thing generally ſpoken: Secondly, to the particular concluſion contained therein and thence deduced, and this aſſent muſt be grounded upon the bare authority of God the ſpeaker in reſpect of his perfect and infallible truth, becauſe it judgeth him faithfull, therefore it eſteemes his words true, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it can ſee reaſon for things in his owne diſcourſe and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. This is faith, for example, God ſaid to <hi>Noah</hi> there ſhall be a floud to drowne all the world, there was no reaſon to thinke it ſhould be ſo,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.7.</note> but God ſaid ſo (<hi>warning</hi> Noah <hi>of things not ſeene as yet,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) and therefore <hi>Noah</hi> was verily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that there ſhould come ſuch a floud to deſtroy all mankinde. Againe, God promiſed <hi>Noah</hi> that if hee would build an Arke, God would ſave him and all his family, and all that would come with him into the Arke, There was no naturall likelihood for this neither, for in ſuch a floud an Arke or the beſt ſhip in the world could not keepe men ſafe, but that with the furie of the waters they would have beene daſhed againſt ſome rocke or other, and wracked, yet God ſaid ſo to <hi>Noah</hi> and he beleeved it for himſelfe and his family. This you ſee was <hi>Noah</hi> his faith. And I call upon you to conſider, whether you have this faith or not. Doe you aſſent to all the narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, promiſes, threats of Gods Word, even becauſe God the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:27208:49"/>
Author of it is true and doe you aſſent to the particular concluſion concerning your ſelves in that generall contained. The Lord threateneth in his Word,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things,</hi> doe you beleeve this generall, and the particular that will follow from it, but I have not continued, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore I am curſed. Againe, the Goſpell ſaith, all that doe not repent and beleeve ſhall be damned. Doe you beleeve this? and doe you beleeve the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular contained under this? I doe not repent and beleeve the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, therefore I ſhall be damned, or contrarily I doe repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, therefore I ſhall be ſaved. Search what authority Gods Word hath with you, if you deduct the particular from the generall in every point, then you doe beleeve the generall, els you do not.</p>
            <p>And alas how manifeſt is it that moſt men have no faith but alone ſay they have as S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh, and beguile their owne ſelves. The threats of Gods Word and his promiſes are of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue with moſt men, they doe not perſwade themſelves, that any of thoſe evills ſhall be performed againſt them which the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth againſt ſuch ſinners as they be, nor that any of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſhall be performed to thoſe that performe the things contained in the promiſes. If they ſee naturall likelihood of any good or evill they can be perſwaded it will come, but if there be no proofe but a bare promiſe or threat out of the Bible, they make no reckoning that that good or evill will come ever a whit the ſooner.</p>
            <p>Now I pray you ſee and lament your unbeleefe, it is the roote of all ſinne, neither can any ſinne be found to rule farther then this ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and I pray you cry to God to worke faith in you by the Word you reade and heare, for no good at all can it doe you if it be not mixed with faith. And if any man have ſuch faith in Gods Word indeed and not alone in profeſſion and ſhew, happy is that man, for hee ſhall be ſure to find the like acceptance of God that <hi>Noah,</hi> hee that hath this faith muſt needs be in Chriſt and Chriſt in him; for where Gods Word dwells, there himſelfe dwels, and the Word of God dwells in men by faith.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. He was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with feare. Heb. 11.7.</note>A third thing in <hi>Noah</hi> is noted by the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> that he was moved with feare, you ſee he feared Gods threats, he was afraid leaſt he ſhould be drowned with his family among the reſt, if he did not obey God and live vertuouſly and build the Arke at Gods Commandement, and indeed if he had not done ſo he ſhould have periſhed with the world: as whoſoever lives wickedly ſhall be damned, this is a threat, he that hath true faith will not deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with vaine words, and ſay, I am elected, I am a beleever, I ſhall be ſaved though I take liberty to ſinne, but he will feare and depart from evill, and uſe thoſe meanes of eſcaping deſtruction which God hath appointed. So true faith will undoubtedly worke ſuch a feare of Gods threat, as will make a man depart from evill, becauſe it brings a lively apprehenſion of danger and much evill before his eyes if he ſinne, and therefore cannot but worke feare, I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:27208:49"/>
meane a feare of caution as they call it, whereby a man is made warie to ſhunne and eſcape the evill. There is a paſſionate feare whereby the heart is perplexed, the joynts ſhake, and ſuch naturall bodily accidents doe follow it. This feare ariſeth from the bodily preſence or imminent danger of ſome ſenſible evill, and <hi>Noah</hi> did not ſo feare the floud.<note place="margin">A double feare</note> There is another rationall feare as I may well name it, by which a man apprehends an evill thing to come, ſo as he is made carefull to ſhunne, prevent, and dares not bring it upon himſelfe. And this feare lookes on things a great way off, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they offer themſelves to the ſences, and ſuch was <hi>Noahs</hi> feare. And ſuch a feare faith will evermore bring with it. It will cauſe that a man ſhall not dare to doe the things forbidden out of an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the greatneſſe and extremity of the danger that will ariſe.</p>
            <p>Now looke to your ſelves my Brethren, doe you feare Gods threats, doe you feare the curſe of the Law, the wrath of God, hell fire, damnation, with ſuch a feare as makes you uſe the meanes to eſcape theſe evills, and makes that you cannot be bold to doe the things againſt which the Lord ſpeaketh theſe things. If you brag of faith in Gods promiſes and have not faith in his threats, your faith is a vaine fancie, and a meere painted or dead faith, for no man can credit any thing which God ſpeaketh if he doe not credit all ſo farre as he knowes and conſiders it, becauſe God cannot be deceived in any thing. And if you ſay you beleeve Gods threats and doe not feare, I ſay againe, be not moved through feare to doe the things by which you might eſcape thoſe evills threatned, even to forſake the ſinne and repent, certainely you deceive your ſelves and doe not beleeve. Now it is moſt evident, that moſt men entertaine Gods threats without any feare. They are not affected at all with the heare-ſay of theſe evills, therefore it is ſure they have no faith. See your want of faith by the abſence of this never failing effect thereof, and couſen your ſelves with a ſhadow of faith no longer. And now pray God to plant in your hearts ſuch a feare of his threats as hath beene ſaid. It is a moſt wholeſome thing to have the ſoule over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed with apprehenſion of the evills which God denounceth againſt evill-doing, and to be thereby kept downe, ſo that it hath no courage to lift it ſelfe up to naughty deeds. Bleſſed is he that thus feareth alwaies, O that you would <hi>worke out your ſalvation</hi> in this <hi>feare and trembling,</hi> O that the ſame minde might be in you that was in godly <hi>Iob!</hi> who ſaid that terrour from God did keepe him from doing any wrong to his ſervant, and that of the holy Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.11.</note> who ſaid that knowing this terrour, he did perſwade men and was made manifeſt to God. Let thoſe threats, <hi>if you live after the fleſh you ſhall die,</hi>

               <hi>and for theſe things ſake the wrath of God comes on the children of diſobedience,</hi> and many the like be often in your mindes, let them awe you and hold under the ſtrength of your corruptions, cauſing you to denie

               <hi>The feare of the Lord is to depart from evill,</hi> this feare of the Lord is the beginning of true ſaving wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to them that thus feare are all the promiſes of the Goſpell made,<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.9.</note> yea it is in one word ſaid, <hi>thoſe that feare the Lord ſhall want nothing.</hi> Never thinke that your faith is right and good if it do not produce this feare, for faith muſt acknowledge God to be faithfull in all his words, threats as well as promiſes, and this grace is that which being planted in the heart of man, doth keepe him from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from faith, doth preſerve the ſoule to ſalvation, by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in it this good and vertuous feare of damnation: as faith kept <hi>Noah</hi> from drowning by making him holily to feare drowning.</p>

            <p>Here is his faith which brought forth obedience to the word of God, in ſuch things which ſeemed ridiculous to the world, and made him a laughing ſtocke unto all the world almoſt: <hi>Noah</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth the youngeſt of the Patriarkes, hee will needes be thought to have better acquaintance with God, then either <hi>Henoch</hi> or <hi>Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelah</hi> or <hi>Lamech</hi> or any of his Grandfathers that have lived or do live. None of them could ſee a floud comming, none of them had a fancy of the worlds being drowned, none of them bethought himſelfe of making an Arke, but this fellow hath gotten ſome new revelation, and hee is a building a huge thing like a Cheſt almoſt ſo long, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So you think the man is not in his right wittes!

For wicked wittes will never ceaſe gybing at thoſe good things that croſſe their ſence and reaſon, Yet <hi>Noah</hi> obeyed, went on, built the Arke, that is, was obedient to God in a thing that made him ridiculous to the world. So will true Faith do, it will make a man obey the Lord in thoſe actions by which hee ſhall make himſelfe a deriſion to all men almoſt, and more then a deriſion, a prey and ſpoile too. The Obedience of Faith is ſuch an Obedience as will make all men to be at Gods becke in acts of that nature as will cauſe him to be blamed and deſpiſed of all the world, as we ſee in <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in all thoſe almoſt that are reckoned up in the 11. of the <hi>Heb.</hi> Becauſe it makes a man firmely and ſtedfaſtly to apprehend greater good things and greater evill then thoſe that are ſeene, and ſo thoſe viſible ones do not ſway him and rule on him; for hee that ſees a greater danger or evill, will eaſily caſt himſelfe upon

                  <hi>Noahs</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the floud.</note> Hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Arke as God bad him, and committed himſelfe to Gods protection truſting on him for ſafety. Here was no maſt, oare, rudder, canvaſſe or marriners to ſteere and guide this veſſell, a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it was that the billowes did not caſt it over and over, that they did not breake the barres by their continued rage, and that it had not periſhed with all its burden. But in went <hi>Noah</hi> taking all the Beaſts with him, aſſuring himſelfe to be ſafe, for ſo God had told. Here is an excellent act of faith, even to uſe Gods meanes of attaining the good things promiſed, and there reſt himſelfe without any further carking and perplexity of mind. This was the act of <hi>Noahs</hi> faith all the floud time, hee heard it raine as if Heaven and Earth would come together, he perceived the cloudes to be in a fury with the ſonnes of men, the waters raged and roared, and through the windowes hee might ſee how all was changed into a Sea, yet there he kept himſelfe quiet, and made account, that himſelfe and his houſhold ſhould do well enough in all this confuſion of nature. Hee had Beares, Lions, Tigers, Wolves and all manner of devouring beaſts within the Arke, hee was never a whit afraid of ſuch neighbours, but reſted himſelfe peaceably upon Gods promiſes. O Beloved that we could do ſo for our ſoules, for our eſtates, for every thing, uſe Gods meanes, and then promiſe our ſelves the wiſhed effect, and trouble our ſelves with no further feare and diſmayedneſſe as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.6.</note> doing well and not being diſmayed with any feare. O how happy would our lives be in the midſt of a deluge of dangers, if we could thus enter into our cloſets as it were, and ſhut the doore: I meane uſe Gods meanes and reſt on him.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Noah</hi> continued in the Arke till God bad him come out, hee perceived the waters to ceaſe raging, hee diſcovered the tops of the mountaines: hee ſends out the diſcoverers, the Raven and the Dove, and learnes by them great abatement, and he ſees with his eyes all day when he had removed the top of the Arke, yet hee ſtirres not out till God bad him goe out, who had bidden him goe in. So muſt you do my Bretheren, you muſt tarry in the Arke as it were ſo long as God ſees fit and not make haſt out of it of your owne heads. Be ſo long in affliction as God will have you, goe not out till hee leade you out, you may wiſh the time of deliverance, and ſend out the Raven and the Dove, uſe the beſt meanes you can to helpe your ſelves, eſpecially by prayers to God, and you may remove the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the Arke, you may looke round about by faith, and with joy ſee your deliverance comming forward, but keepe this as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine concluſion, not to ſtirre out of any eſtate though never ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, till you have good warrant from God going before and guiding you.</p>
            <p>Now at laſt ſee what good <hi>Noah</hi> did after the floud,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Noahs</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe after the floud.</note> hee built an
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:27208:51"/>
Altar to God and offered ſacrifice in thankes for his deliverance, and in a deſire to frame his houſhold to true piety, and to eſtabliſh the worſhip of God amongſt them. O let each of us learne carefully to acknowledge Gods goodneſſe in great deliverances, and to offer him the ſacrifice of praiſe, if hee have ſafe guarded us from the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging flouds of adverſity and calamity. And let us be carefull to eſtabliſh and ſet up the worſhip of God in our families, and amongſt our people publikely and privately every way. Build Gods altar, offer Gods ſacrifices, I meane exerciſe Gods religious worſhip, pray, heare, read, meditate, come to the Sacraments: ſet not Gods ordinances at variance. Doe not picke quarrells with anyone of them, exalt not one to depreſſe another, let them all goe together in their times, and eſpecially performe the true meaning of theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. Offer up the ſacrifice of Chriſt in a perpetuall renewing of the memoriall thereof in your ſoules to God and renewing of your faith in it, offer up the ſacrifice of a contrite ſpirit and broken heart, ſighing daily for daily ſinnes and infirmities, offer the ſacrifice of earneſt prayers for all good things, and of hearty praiſes for what wee have received already, and offer up your ſelves to God by him to be ſanctified to doe him faithfull ſervice in all holy obedience to all his holy lawes. Be truely, heartily, uprightly religious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voute in your whole lives.</p>
            <p>But next, <hi>Noah</hi> planted a vineyard, hee fell to husbandry, for my part J doubt not but that God had made vines from the firſt, and that though wee heare of no vineyard, yet there might have beene ſtore of them. But howſoever <hi>Noah</hi> ſet himſelfe to his calling, to husbandry. O let us every man follow him and give himſelfe to his husbandry and his vineyard, the tradeſmans trade is his vineyard, every mans calling is his vineyard, be like <hi>Noah</hi> fall to planting and dreſſing this vine. Abhorre idleneſſe, have ſome vineyard, O how miſerable is hee that hath nothing to do? O how unhappy a thing is it to be in the world as a cipher in Arithmeticke.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, <hi>Noah</hi> is a faithfull Prophet, and pronounceth Gods curſe even againſt his owne ſonnes, herein he becomes to us a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of fidelity in the calling of a Miniſter, even to denounce all things that God puts into our mouthes againſt all perſons, how neere and deare ſoever they be, and ſo of all Governours, to puniſh their inferiours without partiality, whatſoever their offences be.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Noahs</hi> ſinnes.</note>And thus you have <hi>Noahs</hi> goodneſſe, of his badneſſe we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing related too.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Hee was drunke.</note>Firſt, that hee dranke of the wine which he had planted ſo over-liberally, as that hee was drunken, in his drunkenneſſe diſcovered his nakedneſſe, being beſides himſelfe with exceſſe of wine, he had not care to keepe thoſe parts covered which nature would have to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. So his Sonne <hi>Cham</hi> finding him lying in this immodeſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, was ſcandolized and drawne into a great offence.</p>
            <p>Here we learne to take heed of drunkenneſſe, and of all immodeſt

carriage, which being bad in caſe of drunkenneſſe, muſt needs be worſe when a man is ſober and hath ability to conſider better what he doth, and to refraine from ſuch unſeemely deeds. Brethren, if any of you have beene drunken, if any have in his drinke or otherwiſe perpetrated immodeſt and leud acts, I beſeech you learne of <hi>Noah</hi> to repent of it, and be aſſured that upon your repentance you ſhall finde pardon. And I pray make not your ſoules bolder to perſiſt in drunkenneſſe, by abuſing <hi>Noahs</hi> example, for he offended but once this way, and through weakeneſſe it may ſeeme, in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to refreſh himſelfe after ſo long penſiveneſſe in the floud, he was freer then was fit. Let not his once offending out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe make you bold to doe the ſame ſinne 100 and 100 times, yea be you more carefull to avoid that treſpaſſe which ſped ſo ill with <hi>Noah.</hi> Drunkenneſſe will make every man diſcover his nakedneſſe, if not of body yet of minde. There is no crime ſo notorious, but the drunken man will caſt himſelfe into it, if occaſion offer it ſelfe, as we may ſee alſo in <hi>Lot.</hi> Wherefore know yee that a good man may be overtaken through infirmity with ſome ſuch groſſe ſinne, but he will not wallow in this mire, he will not allow himſelfe in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it, and give over himſelfe to be drunk day by day, weeke by weeke. And as for theſe groſſe externall acts of evill, you are to be ſo much more carefull to avoid them, by how much God hath given you more power to forbeare them, for a man hath power if he will to forbeare drinking, and therefore if he doe not leave this fault, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee will not, and the cuſtome of ſinning doth make the will ſo inthralled to evill that a man will needs doe it, not needs muſt doe it, whither he will or no, which is ſo farre from excuſing the fault, that it aggravates it exceedingly.</p>
            <p>Yea beloved take heed of all immodeſt and undecent carriages, by diſcovering the ſhamefull parts: for if this were a ſinne in a drunken man, that had not underſtanding to know he did amiſſe, how much more in a man that is ſober which knowes he doth evill and will doe it.</p>
            <p>Now you have <hi>Noahs</hi> faults and his vertues. Looke upon his croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and his benefits.</p>

Now labour to be good, incourage your ſelves in piety, with God you ſhall find favour, hee will make manifeſt his love and kindeneſſe to you though men ſeeme to disfavour you, and the love of God is a thing ſo pretious and comfortable, that it may well overweigh all the anger wrath and diſpleaſure of men.

So God did ſhew his goodneſſe to <hi>Noah,</hi> and gave him do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all creatures, and power to eate fleſh, which before God had given them no warrant to doe, and therefore I ſuppoſe the godly did not uſually unleſſe in ſacrifice if then.

And he was a figure of Chriſt in whom the Lord did make a covenant with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, then the ſecond time, not to deſtroy them with eternall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if they would truſt in his mercy, and repent of their ſinnes. For this temporall covenant was a ſhadow of that eternall, into which all mankind was againe admitted through Chriſt that was to come. But they did ſoone caſt of this covenant in running to other gods, which may ſeeme to be the onely ſinne that then did caſt the committers quite out of the covenant, other ſinnes did keepe them from injoying the good things of the covenant; but this did caſt them out of it altogether, ſo that having runne into that they were no longer in the covenant. Now ſee Gods grace more fully to us, that hath renewed this covenant which is in Chriſt more evidently, and take we heede of caſting our ſelves out of it againe, by following ſtrange Mediators and Jeſuſſes, as I thinke the Papiſts doe. Whoſoever doth ſeeke to any other merits but only thoſe of Chriſt, thruſts himſelfe out of the covenant of grace, and Chriſt is become of none effect unto him.</p>

               </note>Firſt, God vouchſafed to ſave him in the Arke from the Deluge of waters, ſo that he periſhed not with the world, but eſcaped with his Father and Brethren. It was a ſpeciall and ſingular favour, to make him one of the few, that is, eight perſons that were delivered from the raging waves, and enjoyed the benefit of a miraculous preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that little handfull of men, whereof the Church viſible did then conſiſt. Wee ſee that one was an Hypocrite, a diſſembler, a wicked unſanctified man, who though he continued a profeſſour of the true religion, and worſhipper of the true God with his Father and Brethren, yet was deſtitute of true piety and continued graceleſſe, a ſervant of ſinne, voide of due reverence and charity towards his aged Father, Gods Miniſter and the moſt holy man of all thoſe times, and ſerved God with them alone in outward forme and faſhion.

            <p>See then that the Lord ſhewes a great deale of patience, long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and goodneſſe to hypocrites in the Church, and maketh them partakers of all outward benefits and priviledges which are beſtowed upon the Church: ſo did <hi>Iſhmael</hi> live in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family a long time, and <hi>Eſau</hi> longer in <hi>Iſaacs.</hi> So <hi>Core, Dathan, Abiram,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe rebels and murmurers were brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> paſſed thorough the ſea, ſaw the miracles, and did eate Manna, and drunk wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the rock, and were ſhadowed with the cloud, and conducted by the pillar of fire among the reſt of the ſons of <hi>Iacob.</hi> And I pray you to take heed by this warning, of priding and pleaſing your ſelves in this, that you be members of the Church, eſcape divers puniſhments, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy many mercies, live in good eſteeme among the godly, and carrie away as great credit as any other men in the Church.

In after times, the Jewes brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the Temple of the Lord, and the Temple of the Lord are we, and yet the Lord rejected them and caſt them out of his ſight.

O therefore beguile not your ſelves with ill grounded hopes and build not upon a rotten foundation.</p>
            <p>If you ſay unto mee, why then you leave us in uncertainty and affoord us no ſure pillar upon which to ground our hopes.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, not ſo, but I will turne you to ſome Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſhall give you ſure arguments of comfort, from which if you can conclude your ſelves Gods people, that you are ſo indeed and not alone in ſhew, your comforts will hold water as it were in the day of death and judgement. <hi>Ierem</hi> 7 5. the Prophet bids them <hi>thoroughly amend their waies and their doings and not truſt in lying words.</hi> Loe thorough and univerſall reformation of heart and life, that, that is the onely ſufficient proofe of being Gods children, and ſuch as ſhall inherit his Kingdome: all that can be alledged without this is no better then lying words which will deceive, So <hi>Iohn</hi> did after teach the Jewes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Say not wee have</hi> Abraham <hi>for our Father,</hi> that Allegation will prove fruitleſſe if it goe alone, but what muſt they doe more? <hi>Bring forth fruits meete for repentance,</hi> that is, frame your ſelves to a thorough reformation of your hearts and lives, and ſo S. <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth, <hi>Hee that doth good is of God,</hi>

Therefore againe, I beſeech you ſatisfie not your ſelves with other things, but apply your ſelves to this amendment of heart and life with all ſpeed and with all diligence.

He was a Hypocrite.</note>The firſt ſinne which we gather from that which ſucceeded is this, that he was an Hypocrite, one that contented himſelfe with a bare outward ſhew of goodneſſe, and did not labour for the power of it to humble him, to diſcover his ſecret faults to him, and to heale his ſoule by bringing the Image of God, even the divine nature to him which was alſo the ſinne of <hi>Caine</hi> before, and after too of <hi>Eſau</hi> and of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and many others. Take you heed of this Brethren, take you heed of this. Beware that you be not Hypocrites, ſatisfied with ſome externall ſhew of religiouſneſſe joyned with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill converſation of life, freedome from groſſe ſinnes, and orderly living to the world-ward, but ſeeke after the ſoule-ſpirit of godlineſſe, which conſiſts in finding out and reforming the corruption of your natures, and the ſecret diſorders of your inward man.

But he that ſatisfies himſelfe in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forme of holy duties and of civill honeſt converſation, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the depth of his heart, this man may proove, and if he mend not will proove a guilefull <hi>Cham</hi> at laſt.</p>

This is a great fault to behold the ſinnes and offences chiefely of Parents and other ſuperiours, and moſt of all of godly and holy men. Fathers of the Church and of Religion as well as of our perſons, I ſay, to behold their faults with an over-open and a greedy eye, with ſcorne and ſcoffes and contempt of them and of piety, and of goodneſſe in and thorough them. For this certainely comes from nothing elſe, but a ſecret diſlike and averſneſſe from goodneſſe it ſelfe, againſt which we are glad to pick a quarrell, and are willing to have ſomewhat to object againſt it, that wee may hinder our ſelves from imbracing it, and from a gladneſſe alſo to have ſomewhat to alleadge in excuſe of our owne naughtineſſe, and for the imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening of our ſelves to perſiſt in it ſtill without feare. It is nothing but hypocriſie, I meane a being contented with a falſe counterfeit goodneſſe, yea willingneſſe to favour and allow our ſelves in our owne ſinnes, that maketh us with joy and delight in our ſelves and ſcorne and contempt againſt them, to gaze upon the faults and ill carriages of the godly men with whom wee live, which is alſo ſo much the more aggravated, if the reverence which we owe them in regard of their places, and love in regard of their neereneſſe to our ſelves, have not beene able to withdraw us from ſuch injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>This is one ſinne of <hi>Ham,</hi> curſed <hi>Ham</hi> the Father of <hi>Canaan,</hi> come and examine yourſelves, if none of you have acted <hi>Hams</hi> part againſt your Parents, againſt the Magiſtrate, againſt the Miniſter, againſt any Chriſtian or neighbour: Have you not beheld the faults of any ſuch with content and gladneſſe in it? have you not beene willing to ſtand thinking of that fault? and to make your hearts thereby bold to deſpiſe and ſleight them, to laugh at them and to cenſure them. If this have beene to a perſon neere and eminent, the fault receives great aggravation by that circumſtance, but if it have beene done to any Chriſtian man though not of ſuch worth or neereneſſe, or to any man at all, it was a wickedneſſe to be abhorred, ſhewing a moſt uncharitable diſpoſition;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.6.</note> for <hi>charity rejoyceth not in iniquity,</hi> that is, is not glad to ſee another commit ſinne, and withall an heart that is willing to hide its owne ſinnes and make them ſeeme little or nothing, and make it ſelfe bold to commit them ſtill by beholding other like ſinnes in other men chiefely ſuch as are bound in duty to be, and in reaſon ſhould be expected to be better then ones ſelfe: hee alwaies ſees the faults of others to ſome miſchievous intention and with ſome evill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that lookes upon them with an open and earneſt eye, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:27208:56"/>
king ſome content in this, that ſuch and ſuch alſo be bad as well as himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now if you have runne into ſuch a fault, call it to minde and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it, and know that how great ſoever the crime was, your crime was as great or greater in ſo beholding, <hi>Hams</hi> thus beholding his Fathers nakedneſſe was worſe then his Fathers diſcovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And now I require you to make <hi>Ham</hi> your warning, doe not as he did, but as your owne conſciences tell you that he ſhould have done. Aske thy ſelfe if thou beeſt a reaſonable man of any judgement, what ſhould this ſonne have done in ſuch a caſe, ſhould he not have turned away his eyes from looking on ſuch a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſhould he not have ſighed and mourned, and ſaid, alas, alas, how hath this befalne my poore aged and godly Father, O how was he overtaken with wine that was never wont to exceed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in foode or the like. Should he not have prayed God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him and have told himſelfe in this wiſe, ah doe thou learne O <hi>Cham,</hi> how weake a thing a man is, and how apt to fall into ſinne, that thy ſelfe maiſt learne to be more watchfull, and ſo have caſt ſome garment over the old man to have ſaved him from further diſgrace, if any other perſon might have had occaſion to approach him: Sure you cannot but yeeld that <hi>Chams</hi> duty had beene to have carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thus reſpectively and pitifully towards his Father, doe you as duty bound him to doe, not as leudneſſe and naughtineſſe promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to doe. Mend his faults and imitate them not, be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and not followers of what was amiſſe in him: Commiſerate the ſinnes and falls of other men, chiefely Parents, Magiſtrates, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Aged men, and men of former godly converſation and of vertuous and religious carriage in other things: I ſay commiſerate them, pray for them, lament their weakeneſſe and their ſlips, take notice of your owne dangers and ſo wake your ſelves by their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But whoſoever will contemplate ſuch dolefull ſights with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and inſultations, ſaying, <hi>Aha, aha,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of his Adverſaries, that man will collect boldneſſe to ſinne and impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in ſinne, and a ſleighting of righteouſneſſe and righteous men from ſuch offences, and ſo will ſtumble and fall and deſtroy himſelfe againſt thoſe blockes as they may be termed.</p>
            <p>But I come to another fault of <hi>Chams.</hi> He contented not himſelfe to ſee but muſt alſo blab abroad what he had ſeene,<note place="margin">He acquainted his Brethren with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> and tells it not alone to one, but to his two Brethren that were without and did not ſee it. He left his Father ſtill uncovered, and gets him out of doores to finde <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> and ſo ſoone as he met with them, reports, no doubt laughingly and fleeringly what he had ſeene, like enough adding alſo words to this purpoſe, to draw them to the like, and bid them goe in and they ſhould ſee ſuch a thing as they would little have thought ever to have ſeene. But let us ſatisfie our ſelves to take the fault as it is ſet downe. He told the fault and told it to his two Brethren that were without and needed not to have beene acquainted with their Fathers
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:27208:56"/>
nakedneſſe, if hee wretched whiſperer could have commanded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſilence.</p>
            <p>So you have in him that foule ſinne of whiſpering of another mans faults behind his backe,<note place="margin">Whiſpering is a great ſin.</note> aggravated with the conſideration of the perſons againſt whom he ſinned, his Father, and towards whom, his Bretheren both of them, and where, even without. It is a ſinne and wickedneſſe to ſcatter abroad the faults of others, and to divulge thoſe matters of diſgrace againſt them, which a man might eaſily keepe cloſe, if he were maſter of his mouth, and is not bound by any duty to reveale; and eſpecially to blab them to ſuch as elſe would not know them, and ſuch as might be moſt grieved and hurt by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them. This J ſay is a ſinne, it proceedeth either from a twat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling laxative humour cauſing that a man muſt vent all he knowes, and be talking of many things, or elſe from an uncharitable diſpoſition to the party whoſe name one tenders not, his perſon one loveth not. It is hurtfull to the ſpeaker, feeding his hypocriſie, making him ready to commit the ſame or the like ſinnes, and hurtfull to the hearer, to infect him or to grieve him, and to him of whom report is made to reproach and diſcredit him, and withdraw the heart of the hearers from him. It is much aggravated when the thing reported is falſe and uncertaine, taken up upon meere heareſay, and the perſon of whom J ſpeake, either my Parent, Brother, Friend or Superior, my Magiſtrate, Maſter, or of note in the Church, as a Miniſter, or eminent in goodneſſe, as this juſt <hi>Noah.</hi> This was the fault of <hi>Cham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I call upon your conſciences to find out your ſinnes in the like kind, if not degree, have you not ſpoken of the faults of your governours or of others, to others meerely to diſgrace, or elſe meerely to hold up talke when other matter failed. Bretheren do not count this a ſmall offence, a talebearer, a whiſperer, a revealer of ſecrets, is no ſmall offender. Hee doth not walke according to the plaine rule of our Chriſtian Religion, <hi>doe as you would be done to,</hi> he doth not bridle his tongue, he doth not walke according to charity. He is injurious to the name of another, and a wrong doer to the whole world, by ſcattering abroad examples of evill, hee ſhewes himſelfe no hater of ſinne, that loves as it were the ſmell and favour of it. He is a manifeſt tranſgreſſor of Gods Commandement, and at laſt makes himſelfe odious to thoſe that heare him, and to thoſe that are ill ſpoken of by him. For the hearer cannot chooſe but diſcourſe thus, if hee ſpare not anothers name, whether will he ſpare mine in another place, and therefore I have no reaſon to truſt him or be familiar with him, and he whom he hath miſreported will heare of it at laſt, and then hee will hate him, as a perſon treacherous and falſe-hearted, and cannot but reaſon thus with himſelfe, ſo long I have lived by him and ſo neare, ſo often have I beene in his company, hee never opened his mouth to admoniſh me, but in mine abſence to do me diſgrace hee hath not beene ſparing. It cannot be that he wiſheth my good in his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:27208:57"/>
heart, that uſeth not his tongue to do me the greateſt good, that is, to reforme, but doth imploy it to doe me the greateſt hurt he can, that is, to diſgrace me.</p>
            <p>Therefore if you have beene whiſperers, ſee the fault and be ſorry. It is a <hi>Cham</hi> like treſpaſſe; And now charme your tongues I pray you, as from all evill language, ſo ſpecially from telling other mens ſecret ſinnes abroad, and making that open which might have beene well kept cloſe: Whoſoever hath made his Brothers faults, eſpecially a Parents or the like, open to any man, if he himſelfe might have kept them from that one without ſinne, hath committed a ſinne in ſo doing. Further then wee are moved by the neceſſity of our duty to reveale other mens offences, we are bound in duty to conceale them, farther then it would have beene a ſinne not to have ſpoken of them, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a ſinne to talke of them. You muſt not thinke, that it is at your liberty to declare your neighbours ſecret faults, when you will your ſelves, you would not have others deale ſo with you. As wee may not lawfully hurt our neighbours body till ſome neceſſity of duty bind us, ſo neither his name, for the ninth Commandement, at leaſt the fift requireth to be as chary of that, as the ſixt doth to be chary of his body. Ceaſe, ceaſe to be whiſperers, above all take heed you bee not worſe then <hi>Chams,</hi> for hee ſpake nothing but what he ſaw with his owne eyes, O do not you dare to ſpeake what you never ſaw, but either conjecture alone of your owne head, or have onely heard of others.</p>
            <p>Thus wee have done with <hi>Chams</hi> fault, now let us conſider his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">

So <hi>Cham</hi> by diſcovering his Fathers fault gets a grievous curſe upon himſelfe and his poſterity.</p>
            <p>O learne to terrifie your ſelves from this ſinne, by threatning your ſelves with this curſe. Shall J provoke God to curſe me and my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after me? ſhall I ſow the ſeed of miſery for my ſelfe and thoſe that are to come of my body hereafter?

Hee was the firſt that affected to erect a Monarchie,<note place="margin">The firſt that ſtrove to erect a Monarchie.</note> and to make himſelfe a commander over men by force and ſtrength of armes, ſo that his ſinne, was ambition, uſurpation, tyranniſing, that is, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent inforcing men to yeeld to his dominion,<note place="margin">Was as a tyrant and ambitions.</note> whether they would or not, though he had no right or title to command over them, for hee was the ſonne of <hi>Cham,</hi> who was the youngeſt of <hi>Noahs</hi> ſonnes, and withall accurſed of God to be a ſervant of ſervants, and yet he would make himſelfe a commander over others, and we have it noted, what City he began firſt to erect his tyrannie in, <hi>viz. Babel,</hi> whence it may ſeeme the plague ſpoken of afterwards did drive him, and yet he left not but went to other Cities, and made his dominion ſtill larger and larger.</p>
            <p>Learne of him to take heed of ambition and tyranny, J need not to pray you to forbeare a tyrannicall uſurpation over Cities and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but take you heed of that degree of tyranny which is incident to men of your ranke, even of carrying out your owne will againſt equity and right. A tyrant is an odious name, this mighty hunting made <hi>Nimrod</hi> infamous, he did openly profeſſe and practiſe it, which ſeemeth to be meant by calling him mighty hunter in the ſight of God. He cared not for God nor man, but openly and in the ſight of God and man attempted to ſubdue the nations and people round about him, and to make himſelfe a great commander. Put away from you ambition, vaine glory, covetouſneſſe, violence, and all thoſe ſinnes which are together wrapped up in this one word tyranny; ſo I have done with theſe two particular ſinners.</p>
            <p>I goe on to ſet before you a troupe of ſinners all at once, whereof I conceive that <hi>Nimrod</hi> was the ringleader, for it was done at <hi>Babylon</hi> his City which he built, and which he had conſtituted the head and Metrapolitan City of his dominion. The fault you have ſet downe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.2, 3, 4. <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</note> that paſſing through the countrey Eaſtward from the place where <hi>Noah</hi> lived, and meeting with a very fruitfull plaine in the land of <hi>Shinar,</hi> that is, of <hi>Chaldea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their faults.</note> they conſulted to make brickes (for that the countrey afforded not hewne ſtone,) and to uſe a kind of naturall mortar or ſlime that abounded in that place in ſteed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:27208:58"/>
of artificiall mortar, and ſo to build a City and a Towne that ſhould reach up to Heaven, mooved thereto partly out of an ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of a great name and credit to continue long afterwards, and to ſpread farre and neere for the preſent, to prevent diſperſion, which their guilty conſciences cauſed them to feare, though no ſuch thing was yet begun to be executed upon them. Here we muſt informe you of their ſinne, which was not ſimply the building of a City, nor buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it of ſuch matter, but ambition and vaine glory, and carnall confidence, and then the puniſhment of their ſinne in the dividing of their tongues, and ſcattering them abroad.</p>
            <p>Firſt then their ſin is a vaine-glorious erecting of a ſtrong City and an exceeding high tower, joyned with a confident perſwaſion that they ſhould ſave themſelves from any miſchiefe and calamity, by meanes of their City. The occaſion that did further them to this worke is, that they were all of one language, and ſo would eaſily agree upon a bad thing, and that they met with a fit place, and had fit matter bricke and ſlime, and that they were ſo fully bent upon it to finiſh this their tower, that no meanes was left to ſtop them, but Gods comming downe upon them with ſome heavy chaſtiſement, I conceive that they had finiſhed, or neere finiſhed their City, and were now ſetting apace and eagerly about the tower, afore the Lord did croſſe them by that puniſhment. For ſeeing <hi>Babel</hi> was the beginning of <hi>Nimrods</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and that he could not have finiſhed it after the diviſion of tongues, if he had not done it wholly, or for the moſt part before, it will follow in likelihood, that they were permitted to ſettle therea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>long while, and to finiſh their City. But when they grew ſo mad that with a City they would have a Tower, as it were to outface God and ſave them from diſperſion in deſpight of him, then it was high time for the Lord himſelfe to oppoſe them.<note place="margin">

Be not I ſay vaine-glorious,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:27208:58"/>
let not your hearts affect this foaming froth of mens tongues. Care not for ſuch kinde of praiſes and commendations: but ſet your hearts upon better things, to get you a name in Heaven, and in earth to be good, holy, juſt. Praiſe is a thing which the Apoſtle commandeth us to follow, but by praiſe he meaneth praiſe worthy things, not praiſe it ſelfe further then it is a neceſſary effect and companion of things praiſe-worthy. Be good for conſcience ſake to God, that ſo you may have, though you ſeeke not after it, good eſteeme of men and their good reports. This vaine-glory will ſo choake all true deſire of goodneſſe and all true goodneſſe, that at laſt it will make you to fall into that high degree of Hypocriſie, as with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> you ſhall doe all your deeds to be ſeene of men, and if you doe any good thing, ſhall even looſe your reward in Heaven.</p>
            <p>But againe, take heede alſo of carnall confidence, that is,<note place="margin">2.

That is carnall confidence, to make ones ſelfe beleeve that he ſhall continue ſecure from all earthly dangers in reſpect of a Citie, a Tower, a friend, a great eſtate, or the like. Alas, all theſe things be vanity and lies, they are the arme of fleſh. Truſt not in Princes, truſt not in Horſes or in Chariots, truſt not in wiſedome, truſt not in man. The Holy Ghoſt doth every where diſſwade men from this vaine confidence, and pronounceth a curſe againſt them that truſt in fleſh and tells them that they withdraw their hearts from God. He that conceiveth ſo well of any earthly thing as to promiſe himſelfe ſafety from that, is made careleſſe by that of ſeeking Gods favour, and is ſo earneſt after that, as hee will not have leaſure to thinke of pleaſing and obeying God, and ſeeking to him and truſting on him. It is a fearefull ſinne, and yet a common one, hardly can men keepe their hearts from committing this idolatry, you muſt humbly pray to God to diſcover to you the vanity of all earthly and terrene things, and to ſhew his Omnipotency and All-ſufficiency, that ſo he may be your confidence and your dread.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, beware of that ſinne of wilfullneſſe and obſtinacie,<note place="margin">3.

Wherefore put you on a flexible and tractable diſpoſition, and an heart that will eaſily be diſſwaded from an evill way.

with himſelfe, the Father with the Sonne and Holy Ghoſt to goe downe (by the powerfull worke of his hand) and to confound their languages, and by that meanes to ſtop their worke and ſcatter them thence, from which effect the world did call that Citie <hi>Babel</hi> or confuſion, ſo inſtead of great honour and a great name, they gate ſhame and confuſion, and were thence diſperſed, from whence they expected ſafety from diſperſion. Thus God catcheth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in their owne devices, brings miſchiefe on them from that wherein they truſted for ſafety, and ſhame from that from which they expected glory.

               <hi>Sem</hi> had God for his God and the dominion of <hi>Canaan</hi> given him, that is, the true Religion was to continue in his poſterity, the Meſſiah to come of him, and his ſeede to have the poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> at laſt was to be brought to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the ſame Religion with him, by the perſwaſion of the Goſpell.

Whether <hi>Iaphets</hi> ſelfe were a godly man, it is not certaine, but in doubtfull things it is good to incline to the beſt ſide, and to take things in the beſt part, therefore we will hope that he was ſo, and with <hi>Sem</hi> did inherit the bleſſing in his perſon as well as after his ſeed was admitted unto it.

               <note place="margin">His vertues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God. 1 His faith. Heb. 11.8.</note>Firſt for God, hee is commended for faith, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaith the Author of the <hi>Hebrewes, by faith called of God,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Abraham by faith offered up,</hi> ſo that faith he had, and was called the <hi>friend of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 2.23.</note> as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Iames</hi> witneſſeth, now without faith no man can poſſibly pleaſe God or be his friend. So had <hi>Abel</hi> as we ſhewed you before, ſo had <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo had <hi>Henoch,</hi> ſo had all the godly at all times. This grace is the cardinall grace, the radicall grace, that upon which all other graces grow as on their roote, and on which they move as the doore upon its hinges. Therefore you that would be called the children of <hi>Abram,</hi> heires of the bleſſing of <hi>Abram,</hi> come and compare your ſelves with him, and ſee whether you be faithfull as he was,<note place="margin">What faith is.</note> to that end know, that faith is the grace by which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve things inviſible and ſupernaturall concerning another life here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

               <note place="margin">
                  <p>Three acts of faith</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith of God, which hath foure acts.</p>
               </note>It hath three ſorts of acts in regard of which it is ſtiled by three titles: Faith of God, Faith to God, Faith in God. Faith of God is that by which we beleeve that there is ſuch a God as indeed he is. All conceits of God are not of faith, but thoſe apprehenſions of him which agree to his being and conceive him to be ſuch as himſelfe doth ſet forth himſelfe to be, and you ſhall ſee what <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved concerning him. 1. He beleeved that this God was one and but one as the Scripture witneſſeth of him. He worſhipped God, he called on the name of God, he builded an Altar to God, not to gods or more gods, but to one God JEHOVAH. 2. He beleeved that this one God was True, Omnipotent, able and willing to doe any thing that he ſhould ſpeake, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was All-ſufficient and faithfull, as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:27208:61"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, being fully perſwaded that what he had ſpoken he was able alſo to performe, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. that he was able to raiſe him from the dead. 3. He beleeved that this one God was poſſeſſor and judge, and therefore alſo <hi>Maker of Heaven and Earth.</hi> And 4. That he was righteous and would doe righteouſneſſe in puniſhing the wicked that lived in ſinne, and in ſparing and being favourable to the righteous man that did ſtudy to walke before him in a good converſation. Now theſe be the principall things to be aſſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to concerning God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Abraham</hi> had faith to God, that is,<note place="margin">2. Faith to God</note> he gave conſent to all thoſe things that God ſaid, becauſe he ſaid them, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followeth from his acknowledgement of the truth, power, and All-ſufficiency of God: So doth the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> note, that it was a land which after he ſhould receive for an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. He beleeved that God would give him that land according to his promiſe, and he beleeved above hope in hope, that he ſhould be Father of many Nations, and it is ſaid, that God preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell unto him, ſaying,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.8.</note> 
               <hi>in thy ſeed</hi> (which is Chriſt) <hi>ſhall all Nations be bleſſed.</hi> He beleeved that of his ſeed ſhould come the Meſſiah which ſhould free mankinde from the curſe, and make them partakers of the bleſſing. So he beleeved Gods threats againſt <hi>Sodome,</hi> that God would deſtroy it with fire.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he believed in God. 1.<note place="margin">3. Faith in God</note> He truſted upon his mercy in the promiſed ſeede, that for his ſake, not for the worth of his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, God would be mercifull to him and ſave him.<note place="margin">Rom. 4 3.</note> He beleeved in God, and this faith was <hi>counted unto him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> He was juſtified by this faith as the inſtrument, he did not worke, meaning in reſpect of juſtification, he did not thinke to be pardoned and accepted for the workes ſake, but beleeved in him that juſtified thoſe which in themſelves be ungodly, by juſtifying he meanes, pardoneth their ſinnes, as it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.2.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſinne,</hi> for the promiſe was not made to him by the workes of the Law, but the righteouſneſſe of faith, that is, the righteouſneſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes as he deſcribed it before. Now if you have this faith and all theſe acts of faith, then you are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſonnes, if not, in vaine doe you lay title to his inheritance. Therefore trie your ſelves, and if you have this faith then know your ſelves happy, if not, you are farre from bleſſedneſſe, you are ſtill under the curſe.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, <hi>Abraham</hi> feared God.<note place="margin">2. He feared God.</note> True faith will bring forth the feare of God, not the paſſion of feare, nor ſlaviſh feare, nor feare of flight, but the feare of caution and warineſſe, a not daring to offend God, as the Lord himſelfe witneſſed of him, ſaying, <hi>Now I know that thou feareſt mee when thou haſt not ſpared thine onely ſonne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 22.12.</note>
Loe, the feare of God is ſuch a diſpoſition of heart to God-ward, out of the apprehenſion of his excellency and greatneſſe and juſtice, that will cauſe a man not to be bold to dare to omit any worke that Gods Commandement injoyneth him unto, and ſo not to commit any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:27208:62"/>
thing that God condemneth. I pray you conſider, have have you this vertuous feare of God? Doe your hearts ſtand in awe of him? ſo that you flie from the offending and diſpleaſing of him, as from the greateſt of all evils; thoſe that have Gods feare before their eyes, they are godly like <hi>Abraham,</hi> thoſe that have it not, they are wicked, as <hi>Abram</hi> thought the men of <hi>Gerar</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> to be; O labour for it, if you have it not yet, get it, if you have it, labour to increaſe and nouriſh it by conſidering his great excellencie and great terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. Was obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</note>A third vertue, <hi>Abraham</hi> had obedience, that is, his will was thoroughly ſubject to Gods will in all things, ſo that he held this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution within himſelfe, that whatſoever God bad him doe that he would doe, for which God praiſed him, ſaying, <hi>becauſe thou haſt obeyed my voice,</hi> and the Apoſtle, ſaying, <hi>he obeyed and went out.</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a reſolution and indeavour to doe all that God bids, becauſe he bids.<note place="margin">Some ſpeciall acts of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> obedience</note> Let us take ſome ſpeciall acts of obedience, wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> did croſſe his reaſon, and his affection, and his credit, and his profit, and all to performe the will of God, even therefore onely, becauſe God bad him, whom he durſt not out of feare and would not but out of love follow in all things.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Left his Countrey at Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note>Firſt, God gave him Commandement to leave his Countrey and Fathers houſe, to goe out into a land which he ſhould ſhew him: A ſtrong Commandement, leave all thy kindred and goe into a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey thou knoweſt not whither, but goe from place to place as I ſhall ſhew thee. Here ſeemed no reaſon in this Commandement, but <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Lived in tents at Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Heb. 11.9.</note>Secondly, when he came into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he did not build a Citie, nor an houſe there, but dwelt in tents as the Apoſtle noteth, as a pilgrim and a ſtranger, not having poſſeſſion in it at all, ſo much as a foot, God gave him no place of abode, but cauſed him to wander as himſelfe telleth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.13. This ſeemed an unhappy and unſetled life, and fleſh and bloud could not take content in ſuch a kinde of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but becauſe God injoyned <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo to live. He ſubmitted himſelfe and did live ſo, ſave that onely he bought a place to burie in, as being ſtill mindfull of his death.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. Circumciſed himſelfe and all the males of his family.</note>A third heavie Commandement he received from God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. and 26. God made him to circumciſe himſelfe and all the males of his family, and all that ſhould after be borne when they were eight daies old, and he made no queſtion of it: To circumciſe was to cut off the top of the uppermoſt skinne of the ſecret part; This ſeemed the fooliſheſt thing in the world, a matter of great reproach which would make him, as it made his poſterity after, to ſeeme ridiculous to all the world. It carried an appearance of much undecencie and ſhamefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to cauſe all his ſervants to diſcover themſelves unto him. Much more might have beene alledged againſt this ordinance, what good could it doe? what was any man the better becauſe he had wounded himſelfe and put his body to that torment? yet for all this, <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:27208:62"/>
diſputed not, objected not, made no contrary allegations, but preſently the ſelfe ſame day tooke himſelfe and his ſonne <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in his houſe, and circumciſed them according to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>Yet a fourth commandement more tedious and contrary to reaſon and affection then all theſe,<note place="margin">4. He expelled his wife <hi>Hagar</hi> and ſonne <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mael.</hi>
               </note> which was of it ſelfe exceeding grievous in his ſight, as the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth, that is, the expulſion or excommunicating of his ſonne <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and of his mother <hi>Hagar,</hi> yet when God commanded him to doe it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.12. hee roſe up the next morning betimes, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and ſent away both the mother and the ſonne.</p>
            <p>But laſt of all he obeyed a commandement, that ſeemed to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict nature and religion, and Gods promiſe, and his owne ſalvation,<note place="margin">5.

and the ſalvation of all men, and the truth and honour of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo that God was ſaid to try him to the utmoſt in that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. It was in ſacrificing <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as the Spirit of God not<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So now marke the excellency of <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience,<note place="margin">The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> obedience.</note> hee was obedient for the matter in hard and difficult things, for the manner promptly and readily without gaine-ſaying, ſpeedily and preſently without deferring, and univerſally without excepting, without pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and chooſing. If you be able to produce ſuch obedience to juſtifie your faith, that it may appeare your faith is a working faith, then have you faith indeed and not in word alone: but if your faith be not accompanied with an obedience of the ſame kind, though not in the ſame degree, whereby you are able to yeeld your ſelves to God, reſolving in all things readily and without delay or murmuring to yeeld unto him, how are you obedient? how have you faith, ſuch a faith as was <hi>Abrahams.</hi> All therefore that ſay they beleeve as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, but yet obey not as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, yea are wilfull againſt Gods Commandements, refuſing to doe knowne duties, and to leave knowne ſinnes, that will not circumciſe the foreskin of their hearts, nor leave their countrey and Fathers houſe, nor caſt out their <hi>Iſhmaels,</hi> nor offer up their <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> all ſuch are beleevers alone in ſhew and not in deed. Compare your ſelves with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and if your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be not like his, I ſay as before, having the ſame ground, extent, and properties, it is but a counterfeit faith whereof you boaſt, and no

true faith. Therefore now be earneſt with the living God to worke in you true ſubjection to him, and to make you like <hi>Abraham</hi> his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: for God that wrought his heart to ſuch flexibleneſſe, will and can performe the ſame for you. Pray him to incline your hearts to his ſtatutes, beſeech him to write his law in your hearts, and to cauſe you to keepe his Commandements and judgements and doe them. And if you find ſuch an obedience, though not ſo great, yet that which hath the ſame ground, and ſtrives to attaine the ſame extent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, then take comfort, and be not afraid to call your ſelves ſonnes and daughters of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for <hi>Zacheus</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when leaving his greedineſſe, hee could make reſtitution and give to the poore.</p>

               <note place="margin">4. He was reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</note>Now a fourth vertue in <hi>Abraham,</hi> was religiouſneſſe, for it is ſaid of him, that hee built an Altar to God, and that hee worſhiped God, and that he called on the name of God, and that he payed tithe of all he had to <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and this is for our learning. We muſt call upon God, we muſt profeſſe and practiſe true religion, we muſt offer reall ſacrifices on Chriſt the Altar, we muſt alſo pay tithes of our goods, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.7. You have an Altar built to God, a profeſſion of his true religion among the <hi>Cananites,</hi> there he called on Gods name, that is, performed publike worſhip of ſacrificing and praying, one named for all. And <hi>v.</hi> 13.14. againe it is ſaid, that he came to the place of the Altar which he had made at the firſt, and there called on the name of the Lord. And <hi>v.</hi> 18. there at <hi>Hebron</hi> he built an Altar to the Lord, and when God appeared to him, <hi>C.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 3. he fell on his face before God, ſhewing all due outward reſpect unto him, when he ſpake unto him. And <hi>C.</hi> 14. <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was Prieſt of the moſt high God, and he met <hi>Abraham</hi> and bleſſed him, and <hi>Abraham</hi> gave him tithes of all. I do not thinke he meant onely of all the ſpoiles, though that hee did too, but a conſtant tithing of all he had is meant. This tithing was an acknowledgement of his ſubjection to <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and ſo neceſſary to be performed to Chriſt who is a Prieſt for ever after that order, who muſt bleſſe and take the tithes of us.</p>
            <p>Surely tithing is no Leviticall ceremony, for it is not originally and primarily due to the Leviticall Prieſthood, but it is due to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Prieſthood, even that after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo farre as I ſee, it muſt be eternally due, neither can any man law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully forbeare to pay them to Chriſt, neither can any man receive them in Chriſts ſteede, but he that is Chriſts officer to preach in Chriſts ſteed and ſow his ſpirituall things.</p>
            <p>Now I pray you looke that you be religious as <hi>Abraham,</hi> profeſſe religion, come to Gods houſe, call on Gods name. Learne that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique prayer is an holy ordinance of God, frequent that, and doe not ſlight and deſpiſe it as many of you do, offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices to God. Pay your tithes duely of all, which I know none of you all that doth make conſcience of, you thinke that too deare a price to buy the worſhip of God with, but why ſhould you not ſhew your ſelves

ſubject to Chriſts Prieſthood as well as <hi>Abrahams?</hi> If you could make it manifeſt to be a Leviticall ceremony, you might thinke your ſelves diſpenſed with it by Chriſts comming; But you cannot ſhew any good reaſon why it ſhould be ſo, and here is a good reaſon it was not ſo, for it was due to a Prieſt of another order then that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> wherefore ſhew your ſelves truely religious, by a conſcionable ſetting a part to God the tithe of all you have, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did. For when here it is ſaid he tithed all, and in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> the ſpoiles, it is no reaſon to ſhorten the wider place by the narrower, but to reconcile both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether thus, he paid tithe of all, and alſo of the ſpoiles, as well as other things. I am in hope to prevaile with you for all other things, but in this I have no hope to prevaile, becauſe profit pleades againſt me, and becauſe the thing is controverted and denied by divers. Now when a coſtly ſervice is queſtioned, O how hard is it to perſwade men to ſee that truth and follow it. Well I ſhew you mine opinion, and leave it to God to perſwade you, but in other things which are not controverted, I pray you to obey as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and to ſhew your religion as he did. And ſo we have ſhewed you <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, feare and devotion. O that we could ſhew the ſame vertues in our lives.</p>
            <p>I come to ſhew you next the good carriage of <hi>Abraham</hi> to men-ward.<note place="margin">1. His vertuous carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men. 1. He was true<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly humble.</note>
Firſt himſelfe, then others. For himſelfe, I requeſt you to note, Firſt that he was a very humble man, truely humble, one that did eſteeme himſelfe nothing in compariſon with God, and that is true humility, to have a meane eſteeme of himſelfe out of a true apprehenſion of Gods greatneſſe, and the infinite diſtance betweene God and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, you ſhall ſee this in <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe when God came to ſhew him what ſhould become of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and he out of mercy was mooved to pray earneſtly for them, he ſaith unto God, <hi>I am dust and aſhes,</hi> O good man, that when he came neere to God, he had a ſence of his owne meaneneſſe, and intitled himſelfe no better then duſt and aſhes.</p>
            <p>This humility muſt wee alſo be cloathed withall, it is a neceſſary fruite of the knowledge of God and our ſelves, without which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true Ceriſtians. It is the cabinet and ſtorehouſe of all graces. It allures God to give us grace, it cauſeth all croſſes to ſeeme eaſy if God will lay them on, it makes all duties appeare ſeaſonable.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.7. 2 Cor. 12.11. 1 Sam. 24.14. Luk. 14.11.</note> It is a grace by which a man becommeth like unto Chriſt, who humbled and made himſelfe of no reputation. <hi>Paul</hi> was nothing in his owne eſteeme. <hi>David</hi> counted himſelfe a flea and a dead dog, and Chriſt hath ſaid, that if we humble our ſelves we ſhall be exalted. For alas, be we not ſinnefull, and ſhall we not then be humble? Be wee not mortall men, be we not damnable creatures, and ſhall we not be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! Beloved, ſearch if you have this grace, that is, a meane eſteeme of your ſelves in reſpect of your nothingneſſe compared to God, and your ſinfulneſſe in your ſelves, and if you find your ſelves laid low and made vile in your owne eſtimation, this is to be like <hi>Abraham.</hi>

            <p>Brethren, be not a number of you farre from following <hi>Abraham</hi> in this matter? you have not gotten ſo much knowledge as to be able to teach your people the doctrine of true piety, the way of God, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and judgement, nor doe not ſtrive to get knowledge. And many that have knowledge make no care of communicating. Ah if he that provides not for the family things needfull to the body denies the faith, how is he guilty of that fault, which doth not provide for their ſoules. I beſeech you therefore be humbled for your omiſſion of this duty, and ſet about it now you have helpes enough, and may have time enough, if you will redeeme time from vanity. Doe what God praiſeth <hi>Abraham</hi> for, and what he maketh an argument, why he will reveale to him all that he doth.</p>

            <p>Beloved, you that be husbands, I pray you follow this example, I
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:27208:64"/>
pray you be not bitter againſt your wives. Be not wrathfull to them if you ſee them in paſſion, if they take you up falſely and cauſeleſly, and blame you for that for which you are not blame-worthy, beare with them, give them good words, doe what you can to ſatisfie and content them, ſhew love and wiſedome both at once. Carry your ſelves to them as men of knowledge, not as men of ignorance, and give honour to the woman as the weaker veſſell, this is the counſell that S. <hi>Peter</hi> gives you.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.7.</note> Be ruled by <hi>Abrahams</hi> deeds and <hi>Peters</hi> words. It is the greateſt honour that a man can ſhew to himſelfe to be able to beare and forbeare. A wiſe man beareth things,<note place="margin">Poſſe &amp; nolle nobile.</note> an unwiſe man cannot beare. The wife is ones owne fleſh, a piece of a mans ſelfe yea more then a peece. We are commanded to love them as much as our owne ſelves, and to cheriſh them as Chriſt doth the Church; O be humbled for any paſſions or diſtempers you have ſhewed before your wives, or towards them, even though they have provoked you firſt: and now beſeech the Lord to make you like <hi>Abraham</hi> that ſo you may keepe your families in peace, even though you have paſſionate wives.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will ſay, that <hi>Sarahs</hi> paſſion brake out but once, but your wives very often.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, it is not certaine that <hi>Sarah</hi> was paſſionate onely this one time. Shee that did fall into other diſtempers might againe fall into this, but if ſhee did not, <hi>Abraham</hi> that bare this, out of the ſame reaſon would have borne them too, if it were a duty to deale thus mildely at one time, it was a duty to doe ſo alwaies.</p>
            <p>What then, ſhall a man let his wife beare out her paſſions ſtill and ſleight him that is her head?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, better ſoe, then fill ones ſelfe with paſſion too. And ſecondly, I anſwer, a loving, milde, gentle, admonition afterwards, will prevaile more to make a woman remember her ſelfe, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent rage and bitterneſſe. A drunken man is beſt cured by rebuke when he is ſober, and paſſion is but drunkenneſſe.</p>
            <p>You ſee <hi>Abrahams</hi> carriage to his wife, now I come to ſhew you his carriage to his two ſonnes. 1. He loved them both very well,<note place="margin">4. He loved his two ſonnes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well.</note> as is evident by his praying for <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and his taking the matter hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, when <hi>Sarah</hi> would have him caſt out of doores, but yet he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved neither of them ſo well, but that he could be content to have the one caſt out of his houſe, and the other burnt for a Sacrifice, and to cut off both their foreskinnes.</p>
            <p>So Parents muſt learne to love their children, but with a moderate love, ſuch as that they can be be content to put them to ſmart, ſo farre as God will have them put to ſmart, even by juſt correction to cut off the foreskinne of their hearts, yea to part with them, if God will have them baniſhed, or goe into another Countrey, yea to have them die if God will have them die. Such a moderate love which is ſubordinate to the love of God, we muſt have and exerciſe to the fruit of our bodies, and we muſt ſhew the ſincerity of our
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:27208:65"/>
love to them by praying for them, and the moderateneſſe or our love by being able to puniſh them duely, and to part with them even by death when God ſhall ſend it. O bewaile your carnallneſſe and unloving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and immoderate love to them. Inordinate love of a childe is a great fault, it will undoe the childe, it will make him deſpiſe and abuſe the Parents, it will nouriſh all vices in him, it is the next way to make God croſſe a man in him, it makes a childe an Idol, pray to God therefore to moderate your love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> provided for all his other children by gifts, and gave all he had to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as wee have it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.5, 6. So muſt a good Father provide for his children convenient portions, that they may be able to live comfortably, and provide them fit callings, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, but make moſt account of the moſt godly, and let him be heire whom God hath made heire, even the eldeſt, unleſſe his wickedneſſe diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit him, and I ſuppoſe that it muſt be ſome great wickedneſſe for which a man ſhould diſpoſſeſſe the eldeſt of the greater part of his eſtate, yet ſtill the eldeſt muſt have ſuch a larger portion as that the younger may have a convenient part for them too.</p>
            <p>Learne to be aſhamed, you that are ſpendalls, and keepe nothing for your children, have nothing to give them: and learne you all to be moderately carefull for them, and diſcreetely and indifferently liberall to them. Let not one have all, the other nothing, let not any of them be thruſt off with nothing for the others ſake, but be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to all, O be husbandly and thrifty to get and ſave, and be ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly liberall to them, yet ſo, that ſtill your ſelves be in ſuch caſe as not to make your ſelves underlings to them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. He provided a good wife for <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </note>Againe, for <hi>Iſaac, Abraham</hi> was carefull to provide a wife, even one of the beſt he could though hee ſent farre for her, and it may ſeeme he had not much with her, as you have it in the whole Chapter of <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. Here <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be imitated, if in any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a child, he looked to have a good wife more then a rich. O if you that be Parents would doe ſo, how well would it goe with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a family? what is he or ſhee, not what hath he or ſhee ſhould be the queſtion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> knew that God would provide a wife for his ſonne, it is probable he had prayed for that mercy and received an anſwer, he could not elſe have affirmed it ſo certainely. You that be Parents, muſt pray to God to give a wife or husband to your ſonne and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and make piety and vertue the chiefe match-makers: If you will ever ſhew your love to be a ſpirituall love, let it appeare to be ſuch to your children, if by any meanes you will ſhew your ſelves affected to them with a ſpirituall love, let it be in ſeeking their good really, not imaginarily. That woman ſhall live happieſt, not which hath the richeſt husband with largeſt revenues, but that hath the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt husband, moſt abundant in vertues; ſure a Father ſhould make his daughters happineſſe the maine end of his chooſing an husband for her, or elſe he is not prudent, for prudence is a vertue by which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:27208:65"/>
a man doth worke rightly to happineſſe. I ſay the ſame concerning the wife; be you therefore imitators of <hi>Abraham</hi> here, and be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as our Saviour ſaith in another meaning, to ſeeke thoſe things after which unſanctified men and heathen doe onely or principally ſeeke.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have named one grace more in <hi>Abraham</hi> towards God,<note place="margin">Another grace in <hi>Abraham</hi> toward God, his Patience.</note> that is, patience, I doe not meane ſo much or onely in bearing affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as in a contented tarrying for the promiſed ſeed. A quiet waiting till benefits come, and a quiet bearing of croſſes that did come, this is patience, a being ſilent to God and waiting on him: <hi>Abraham</hi> had waited divers yeares, no ſonne came, his wife was barren, yet he waited and ſtill continued to hope, that God would give him a ſonne at length according to his promiſe. See, how you can waite upon God if he deferre the performance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and that without muttering and without fainting. This is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing to beleeve, pray and hope ſtill though God deferre the accompliſhment of his word. Learne this grace, <hi>Bleſſed is hee that by faith and patience can inherit the promiſes,</hi> as it is ſaid of our godly fore-fathers.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Abrahams</hi> vertues to God are faith, feare, obedience, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or hope and devotion. And to <hi>Sarah</hi> I ſhould have named ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He mourned moderately for her and buried her honourably,<note place="margin">He mourned moderately for <hi>Sarah.</hi>
               </note> for he bought a burying place of the children of <hi>Heth,</hi> that he might interre her with all due reſpect. So ſhould an husband moderate his affection with diſcretion, and joyne diſcretion with his affection, that he may both ſhew ſome convenient meaſure of ſorrow for his wives deceaſe, and alſo power to keepe ſorrow within compaſſe both for degree and continuance, and ſo ſhould wives ſtand affected to hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and all friends each to other, and a decent funerall according to each mans place muſt be affoorded, to teſtifie their good will to the whole perſon when it lived, by due carriage to that earthie part of it which is left behinde. Thoſe yoke-fellowes therefore that are glad or would be glad of each others deceaſe, and care not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the body of each other, they muſt be blamed as naughty and unloving husbands, and thoſe that make no end nor keepe no meaſure in mourning muſt be blamed as over-loving and carnally lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.

Thoſe therefore that having good and vertuous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſhall not ſhew themſelves liberall, and courteous, and loving, but quite contrarily, froward, and unloving, and niggardly, are much to be condemned, as men that have not wiſedome to conſider, how much benefit a man hath by his ſervants, ſo that neither could men get riches nor enjoy them if they wanted ſervants; neither could they be without them in many other reſpects, and if the ſervants be good, next to God, above all men hee ſtands moſt beholding to them. His life is in their hands, his goods are in their hand, and to ſpeake as the truth is, hee is more indebted to them then they to him. A ſervant might more eaſily ſhift for himſelfe without a Maſter, then a Maſter live as he doth without ſervants: wherefore I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you all humanity, love, courteſie towards your ſervants that be good and faithfull, ſuch as feare God and doe their duty in ſuch ſort as humane frailty will permit unto your ſelves. Labour to bring your ſervants to be religious, and truſtie, and diligent, and if they be ſo, ſhew all good will to them and incourage them in their duty by loving entertainement, eſpecially ſeeing now they be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and not bondſlaves that are your ſervants.</p>

So a good Maſter ſhould truſt a good ſervant, onely giving him neceſſary inſtructions, and cautions, and if matter be of ſuch weight, laying the bond of an oath upon him, for no bond ſtronger then that, none fitter to binde a godly man: what might be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of laying the hand under the thigh in ſwearing, I cannot learne nor conjecture my ſelfe, onely it had ſome due ſignification in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, as our laying the hand on the Bible and kiſſing it. <hi>Iacob</hi> alſo required it of his ſonne <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> ſo that it may ſeeme to have beene done in ſome religious reſpect, whether intimating the expectation of the promiſed ſeed to come out of the loynes of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> I cannot ſay. But whatſoever this geſture might meane, we note that <hi>Abraham</hi> truſted his ſervant, and ſo muſt all men needs doe in ſome
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:27208:66"/>
degree, and therefore had need to chooſe good ſervants, or do their beſt to make them ſuch as may be truſted.</p>
            <p>How for all the reſt of his ſervants young men fit for warre, they were 318. with whom he fought againſt the Kings that vanquiſhed the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> He did traine them up to warre as was fit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are called his <hi>trained</hi> or <hi>inſtructed</hi> ſervants, and when hee had gotten the victory, they had leave by him to eate of the ſpoile; ſo that a good man ſhould bring up his ſervants according to his place fitly to do him ſervice, and at leaſt ſhould ſee that they have foode for them, chiefly when they labour and take paines.</p>
            <p>I proceede to <hi>Abrahams</hi> carriage toward forreiners that were not of his houſe, whether kinſmen or frinmen as we call them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Abrahams</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to his kinſmen.</note> he had one kinſman his Couſin german <hi>Lot,</hi> that was ſonne to his brother <hi>Haran,</hi> him he loved very well, and ſtudied to keepe all good peace and correſpondency with him, and to remove all contention, and for that end, when their ſtates were growne ſo great, that they could not conveniently dwell together, becauſe being ſojournours they were to take up but the waſte of the land, which no naturall inhabitant had poſſeſſed, or elſe to take land for money of the inhabitants if they could ſpare the ſame, he came to <hi>Lot</hi> and made the motion of peace, and after gave him his offer to chooſe what part of the countrey hee would, as you may read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.7.<note place="margin">He was peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Here is an excellent vertue of ſo mild and peaceable a diſpoſition, that to prevent ſtrife, can yeeld to his inferiour, in ſeeking to pacifie him by going to him with peaceable and quiet words and offers, and ſo farre part with his owne right, as to give the other the better a great deale, rather then proceed to jarres and diſcontents. O that we could all imitate <hi>Abraham,</hi> eſpecially bretheren, kinſmen, and neere friends, and be ſo deſirous of unity and accord as he was, not ſtouting it out as many do, with ſhall I yeeld ſo farre to him as to goe to him, to let him have his way, let him come to me if he pleaſe, and let him yeeld to mee. Moſt of our ſpirits be ſo big, that they will not bow to any that is a little inferiour, no not for peace ſake, imparting with a little of their right for it. But know, it is an honour to be able to beare and forbeare, he hath the moſt wiſedome and grace, that can part with his owne right, rather then continue a quarrell, if it be not in a matter of very great weight, wherein great dammage ſhould come to him or his family, by parting with it. And know, that to ſtand over highly upon tearmes, and not to bate a jot or tittle, as ſome men uſe in boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting wiſe to affirme that they will not, is a proofe of a man led much by paſſion, and filled much with pride and ſelfe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe. Hee knowes not the valew of peace, that will not redeeme it with bending ſomwhat even to his inferiour, chiefly a neere kinſman. The thing therefore J am to commend unto you, is pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceableneſſe, and for that end moderation and lowlineſſe of carriage, in yeelding a little more then needes to thoſe that ought rather to yeeld to you, and certainely the comfort that peace and concord

He reſcued <hi>Lot</hi> and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him out of his enemies hands.</note>Againe, <hi>Lot Abrahams</hi> kinſman was taken by the Kings that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and when <hi>Abraham</hi> heard of it, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his owne ſervants, and got his confederates to joyne with him, and by force of ſword redeemed <hi>Lot</hi> out of their hands, as you have the ſtorie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.14, 15, 16. together with all the goods and people of <hi>Sodome,</hi> prudently ordering the battaile by night, and comming upon them ſecretly and unawares. Here are three excellent vertues of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Firſt, Love to his kinſman <hi>Lot.</hi> Second, Courage and reſolution, that durſt fight for him. Third, Prudence in ordering the whole buſineſſe. For you muſt take notice that <hi>Abraham</hi> was a little Prince, a kind of petty King in thoſe dayes, as appeareth by the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Abimelech</hi> and others to him, and therefore he had warrant and ground enough to make warre againſt any King, State or perſon upon a juſt quarrell.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">He was loving to <hi>Lot.</hi>
               </note>But firſt marke his love to <hi>Lot,</hi> although <hi>Lot</hi> was lately departed from him, yet his love to <hi>Lot</hi> had not left him, but he was at coſt and labour and hazard to redeeme him from captivity. Muſt not wee learne of him to ſhew great love to our kinſmen and ſpeciall friends, if they be in danger perill and miſery, even to doe all that according to our places we may to ſuccour, relieve and reſcue them, againſt wrong, violence, oppreſſion and like calamities. Be charitable and kind kinſmen and bretheren, cleave to your kinſmen and bretheren, and ſo farre as you may lawfully, and as your places will beare, defend, maintaine and helpe them againſt unjuſtice and injury. No man muſt joyne with his kindred in a ſinnefull and unjuſt cauſe, but in a good and honeſt and juſt cauſe, he is not of <hi>Abrahams</hi> minde, that will not ſticke to them, and helpe them what in him lieth. All therefore that deſert their friends in honeſt matters, for feare of a little coſt or paines or the like, are to ſee, that they be not good imitators of this good man, nay nor any that doth not according to his place, ſuccour the oppreſſed, which <hi>Salomon</hi> commendeth under a queſtion ſaying, <hi>wilt thou not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him?</hi> For muſt we ſuccour an Aſſe preſſed with a burden, and not a brother preſſed with a bundle of injuries.</p>

               <note place="margin">He was coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</note>Againe, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhewed courage in this worke, for had not hee beene of good reſolution, he would not have dared to oppoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to a conquering army and a Prince, that had held divers other Princes in ſubjection, and now came for that purpoſe into thoſe parts, to ſubdue thoſe that had caſt of the yoake. Loe how a good man muſt be couragious too, and not ſuffer himſelfe to be deterred from his duty, or any good and commendable worke, by feare of danger. Courage is ſuch a diſpoſition and frame of mind that will not be daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by perills and dangers,<note place="margin">What courage is.</note> and by evill accidents, that he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter in the workes that his place requireth, but will reſolve what in him lies, with due reſiſtance to repell them, or if they cannot be repelled, to beare them. Such courage <hi>Abraham</hi> here diſcovered,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:27208:67"/>
ſuch courage do you alſo ſhew and exerciſe, let not every ſhew of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger skare you: but goe thorow with good workes, whatſoever comes of it. It is a good thing to be valiant in battaile, where life is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to perill, and is it not a good thing to be valiant againſt all other dangers?</p>
            <p>And that you may be couragious in all things. Firſt,<note place="margin">Meanes to get courage.</note> be ſure the cauſes in which you put your ſelves in hazard, be good and juſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, be ſure that you take God along with you, by keeping his favour in a holy converſation, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, or elſe courage may quickly faile and deceive you.</p>
            <p>And next, learne to deale prudently in all affaires, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, in ſeeking the helpe of his confederates, and taking the opportunity of night, and dividing his men againſt his enemies into ſeverall bands. The excellency of a buſineſſe is in the wiſe carriage of it, labouring to get convenient aid and helpe, and then chooſing fit times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and other circumſtances: We muſt blame our ſelves therefore if by any indiſcretion or failing, we have hindered our owne good ſucceſſe in our affaires, as often times men doe, and muſt pray to God to direct us with diſcretion (for it is his gift,) that we be not cauſes of our owne diſappointment and miſery.</p>
            <p>Now ſee how <hi>Abraham</hi> behaved himſelfe to frin-men as we call them. 1. To the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> 2. To the <hi>Cananites,</hi> 3. To Angels whom he tooke to be travellers.</p>
            <p>Firſt to the <hi>Sodomites,</hi>

                  <hi>Abrahams</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Hee prayed for them.</note> firſt he did moſt heartily intercede to God for their ſparing, if there had beene found, 50.40, 30, 20. Yea but 10. juſt men therein: So great a lover of good men was <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would heartily pray to God to ſave them, and for their ſakes to ſave alſo the people whom they dwelt amongſt, and how well pleaſing this ſervice was to God, it is evident in the ſtorie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.23. <hi>ad finem.</hi> For God did with wonderfull patience accept his ſuites, even till hee came to ſo low a rate, as if he did finde but 10. in the 5. Cities, that is, a poore couple in every City.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt learne hence, to ſhew our loves to man-kind in generall, and eſpecially to juſt and good men, in praying God for all righteous men, that they may be ſaved and delivered, and for the Societies and Cities and countries wherein we live, that they alſo might proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and eſcape for the good ſake of the good that live there. Fervent prayer for humane ſocieties and for juſt men in them, ſhould be made by Gods people. Why ſhould you not improve the right you have unto Gods eares? For the good of many,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.1.</note> 
               <hi>I will that prayers and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications be made for all men,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> eſpecially to pray that God would deliver Cities and Countries from publike and fearefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. Bretheren, why are we ſo defective in this duty? Why do we not pray for the nations abroad? in hope that there may be ſome righteous amongſt them, why are our mouthes ſtopped from ſuch ſuites? Let us now follow our Father here, and let our heartes and mouthes be inlarged with all humble confidence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech

God, for the good of thoſe Cities and quarters of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that are ready to eate up one another, that God would ſhew favour to them and not give them over to periſh by the ſword each of other. Account Prayer an exerciſe of ſome efficacie, have ſo much faith as to know that our prayers ſhall not be vaine labours, and that you beleeve, that God is a God that heareth prayers; onely let all your prayers be as <hi>Abrahams</hi> were, ſervent, humble, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend.</p>

               <note place="margin">2. He ſhewed humanity and kindneſſe to the <hi>Sodomites</hi> he had taken.</note>Another good worke of <hi>Abraham</hi> to the <hi>Sodomites</hi> was, that he did not make them ſlaves to himſelfe and keepe them for his owne uſe, nor ſell them as ſlaves to others, as by the Law of Nations he might well have done, but granted them liberty, and ſet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in ſtate of freedome after he had by the ſword taken them out of the hands of thoſe that had led them captive. He ſhewed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and kindneſſe to them, though they were wicked men and not rigour and extremity.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt all learne to be kinde and loving to mankinde, and not to preſſe men with heavie and grievous burdens, even though wee might doe it in extremity of right. This ſhall bring more love and good will, honour and good eſteeme, then rougher and more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere carriage. It is better to be loved then hated, honoured then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, be counted a friend and ſaviour of men, then a proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that cares not what becomes of others, ſo that himſelfe may make an advantage of them. The comfort that gentleneſſe and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie bringeth, is alſo very much more then that which will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from the contrary. The dying heart can receive no content in thinking he hath cruſhed, inthralled or otherwiſe afflicted men, but that he hath delivered, comforted, ſaved them, that affoordeth great conſolation, in that it becommeth an argument of goodneſſe, and a meanes of hope, that a man ſhall finde mercy as he hath ſhewed and exerciſed it. Let not either covetouſneſſe, or arrogancie, or a cruell diſpoſition make you carrie your ſelves auſterely to men for your owne advantage ſake, but uſe all courteſie, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did even to theſe <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Let them enjoy good things, even though you have power and ſome ſhew of right to deprive them thereof, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe not interrupt juſtice in her acts of ſeverity.

He would not take any thing that was his, no not to a ſhooe-lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and he ſaith, that he <hi>had lift up his hands to God</hi> to that end, that it might not be ſaid by the King of <hi>Sodome, I have made</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>rich</hi> Here <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhewes himſelfe, firſt, a man that did not regard riches, nor eſteeme the wealth of this world, in that of his owne accord he bound himſelfe by a vow, not to touch ſo great a bootie as this, that fell into his hands by juſt conqueſt, and which in all equity he might have taken and that with good thankes too for the preſent time from the King of <hi>Sodome,</hi> who wiſhed alone the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:27208:68"/>
and did willingly yeeld the goods to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood upon termes here of credit for his Religion ſake, and would not have the King of <hi>Sodome</hi> to triumph and ſay, that his wealth had inriched <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee, that we ſhould ſo diſ-valew riches, as freely to caſt them away and deny our ſelves of them, rather then incurre any reproach or diſgrace for them, even though the imputation would be unjuſt. Should not all men labour to have as generous a minde as <hi>Abraham?</hi> Sure, we ſhould ſtrive for the perfection of vertue which hath beene found in the Saints. It cannot be ſaid yet, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have ſinned if he had taken this ſpoyle, neither was hee bound ſo much to the <hi>Sodomite,</hi> as to affoord him either perſons or goods: but he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before hand, that ſome aſperſion of covetouſneſſe would have beene caſt upon him, if he ſhould have poſſeſſed himſelfe of this wealth, and therefore he bindes himſelfe from it by a vow. Noble <hi>Abraham,</hi> that regardeſt due eſteeme rather then great riches, and wouldſt let goe ſo faire a morſell, rather then incurre any the leaſt ſhew of diſgrace for worldlineſſe. Why ſhould not we be followers of <hi>Abraham</hi> his vertues? Why ſhould we uſe meanes to get wealth joyned with apparent reproach? ſuch as would ſet the mouthes of all men on talking againſt us, more then this fact would have filled the mouth of <hi>Chedarlaomer</hi> with talke againſt <hi>Abraham:</hi> O what a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of minde is this newes? and how doth it ſhew our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affection to riches more then to a good name? which yet is to be preferred above all treaſures, if we would hearken to <hi>Salomon.</hi> I conclude, that we muſt ſhew our true magnanimity, by ſleighting great abundance of outward things, ſo as that no man might ever have cauſe to grudge againſt us, that theſe riches which ſhould have beene his if all things had beene fairely carried, have made us rich, eſpecially let no man grow rich by taking forfeitures of poore men, it is worſe to uſe extremity to a meane perſon then to a great.</p>

For the Countrey, <hi>Abraham</hi> made it much the better for him by two things, wood and water, very neceſſary things for the life of man. For hee planted groves and hee digged wells againe, which had beene digged in the daies of his Father. As concerning thoſe groves, it is conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured that they might be for religious uſe, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>there he called on the name of God:</hi> but the word here uſed is not the ſame under which ſuch groves for religious uſe are after forbidden, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more like it is that here alone was intended civill uſe, and ſure it is a good thing to plant wood for the benefit of mankind after our ſelves be dead. A man would have thought,<note place="margin">Planting of wood is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable thing.</note> what ſhould a ſtranger trouble himſelfe to make a grove? He is likely to depart from the place ſoone, and then he cannot carry his trees with him; but this

did not diſcourage <hi>Abraham,</hi> he knew that ſome man might enjoy it if himſelfe did not. Indeed for wells and water, the profit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to himſelfe preſently as well as to others for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Now learne of him to be common Benefactors, by helping to ſtore the world with wood and water-ſprings, and other like things, the uſe of which ſhall redound to many as well as to your ſelves: Eſpecially the care of planting woods ſhould be commended unto you, our age deſtroies that neceſſary proviſion. All cut downe, none plant for another age, wood is uſefull for ſhade, for timber, for fewell, it is one of the things wee cannot want, it is one of the things, that if it be diſcreetely done, will quit the coſt that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. The tree after a little time will grow without any labour of expence beſtowed about it, it will pay for its ſtanding, if you ſet your hedge-rowes with trees, they would grow as well as thornes. If here and there at convenient diſtance, trees were planted, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally timber trees, the graſſe would not be much the leſſe. But I am not a husband-man good enough to commend theſe particulars to you; Let mee commend the thing in generall, Order things for the common benefit, and ſhew your ſelves lovers of mankinde, be not all for your ſelves and for the preſent.</p>

This is a meanes to ſhew love, and to beget love, and to increaſe love, and to keep out jarres and diſcontents, as a ſower and hautie and ſullen dogged carriage doth proclaime contempt or hatred or both, and ſo cauſeth jarres and fallings out, and diſlikes, and increaſeth them if they have beene begun. Thoſe therefore that be of a haughty carriage, or rude and boyſterous behaviour, not knowing how to give due ſalutations or complements of courteſie are to be blamed, as men that doe not alone want education but charity and humility, for if thoſe graces did rule in the heart, though they could not prompt a man to a kinde of artificiall demonſtration of them, yet they would ſome way infuſe themſelves into the carriage, and make it gentle and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

Nothing leſſe be ſeemeth a wealthy man then niggardlinſſe and cloſe-fiſtedneſſe, whereby he is ſo held in captivity, that he cannot willingly let any thing goe from him, but what he cannot keepe though he would. Indeed bounty is chiefely to be exerciſed to the poore and needy, but yet ſo that in due time we muſt learne to practiſe it, by a free giving to our equals alſo, and thoſe that ſtand not in abſolute neede, for gifts are fit meanes to expreſſe the lovers good will, as well as to ſupply the wants of the receivers.</p>

            <p>The laſt part of <hi>Abrahams</hi> good carriage is to ſtrangers, which he conceived at firſt to be men, though indeed they proved to be Angels: for ſo you have his hoſpitality recorded by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 1. <hi>ad</hi> 17.

               <note place="margin">His firſt fault idolatry.</note>The firſt fault of <hi>Abraham</hi> was that in which he lived before his calling by God out of <hi>Vr</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> for it is manifeſt in the 24. of <hi>Ioſh. v.</hi> 2. that the Fathers in old time, even <hi>Terah</hi> the Father of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>Nahor,</hi> and conſequently the ſonnes themſelves, being ſo brought up of their Fathers, ſerved other gods. Here then is a ſinne in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he tooke up the religion of his Fathers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any diligent inquiry into the matter, whether the religion and gods were true or not. And this is a fault common to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, they take their religion on truſt, ſerving thoſe gods which they find in the places where they dwell to be worſhipped and ſerved, and labour not to find out and ſerve the true God alone, who is onely worthy to be ſerved, yea if it fall out that the true God be ſerved amongſt them, they cleave not to him out of judgement and well grounded knowledge, that he is the onely true God, but alone out of common cuſtome, becauſe all men do ſo, and this their religon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth but a vaine religion, and is of no force to their ſalvation. Indeed it was not ſo ſtrange a thing that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away after falſe gods, according as he was led by the common example, ſeeing at that time they had not the word of God written by Prophets and Apoſtles, to direct and guide them in this matter. But for us whom God hath ſo farre favoured as to give us the cleare light of his holy word, it is a moſt grievous ſinne to be led wholy by cuſtome and example, and not to build and ground our ſelves upon that light which God hath miniſtred unto us. And the true cauſe, why men do follow ſuch falſe guides in matter of Gods worſhip, is the blindneſſe of their mindes, and carnallneſſe of their hearts, and the ſecret atheiſme which is in them, by which they are not thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and certainely perſwaded, that there is a God at all, and therefore
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:27208:71"/>
care not to finde out and ſerve the living God, as if it made no great matter, ſo they ſerved one which they ſerved.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore beware of falſe gods and falſe religions, and let us beware of walking after a falſe rule even in following the true God, that is, of ſerving him, not becauſe wee have any true and certaine knowledge of him in our owne mindes, but onely becauſe we have beene ſo taught of our Fathers, and ſee the whole world where we live to take the ſame courſe, for he that is thus blindly led, worſhips God but by chance as it were, and is as ready for a falſe god as for a true, and this was <hi>Abrahams</hi> fault before his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Abrahams</hi> faults after his calling.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Weakeneſſe of faith.</p>
               </note> though not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully nor preſumptuouſly, but of weakeneſſe and of infirmity. The firſt fault was weakeneſſe of faith. Though he was the Father of the faithfull, and is commended in Scripture for the ſtrength of his faith, and that he wavered not nor ſtaggered at the promiſe of God through unbeleefe, yet at the firſt, his faith was mixed with unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, and ſhewed it ſelfe to have ſome feebleneſſe in it. For firſt, when he went downe into <hi>Egypt</hi> becauſe of the famine, and ſaw that the men were wicked and feared not God, he was in doubt, leaſt the men of the place would kill him for his wives ſake. God had promiſed him before that time to give the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to him and to his ſeede after him, and yet he had no ſeed, therefore as yet hee could not be put to death, unleſſe the promiſe of God ſhould faile him and come to nothing. Notwithſtanding the promiſe which ſhould have beene fruſtrated, if himſelfe had died without iſſue, he doubted leaſt he might be ſlaine by them, as being diſtempered and diverted by feare from conſidering and taking diligent notice of the promiſe. This was a manifeſt imperfection of faith you ſee. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us take notice that in the faithfulleſt of Gods people there will be defects of faith, as alſo there was want of it in <hi>David,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>I ſhall one day fall by the hand of Saul,</hi> and in <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 27.1. Exod. 6.12.</note> when he ſaid, <hi>How will</hi> Pharaoh <hi>heare mee? ſeeing the Iſraelites did not,</hi> and againe, <hi>Why haſt thou ſent mee to deliver the people?</hi> ſeeing <hi>Pharaoh</hi> oppreſſeth them the more ſince I ſpake to him.</p>
            <p>And therefore, let us not be diſcouraged though we finde weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in our faith, though faith I ſay doe ſhew it ſelfe feeble and be much troubled, and ſometimes foiled by doubting, eſpecially in great and ſore temptations; yet we muſt not be heartleſſe, nor conclude, that we are utterly deſtitute of faith, or that our faith is not true and ſincere, and unfained. True faith you ſee in <hi>Abraham</hi> may be weake, yea cannot but be weake, ſo long as we be cloathed with tabernacles of fleſh. He that truly beleeves, may yet be carried away with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes, when occaſions of perill and danger incounter his faith; and therefore alſo let us be carefull to confirme and ſtrengthen our faith more and more, and to grow in it by renewing our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods promiſes, and putting our ſelves often in minde of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:27208:72"/>
power and truth of God the promiſe-maker, which are the pillars and foundations of our faith. For if <hi>Abraham,</hi> when theſe doubts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtirre in his minde, had called to minde Gods promiſe of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him ſeede, and had reaſoned with himſelfe thus, hath not the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God poſſeſſour of Heaven and Earth undertaken to give mee a ſeede to inherit this land after me? How then can I be killed by the Philiſtins? How can they take away my life whilſt this promiſe is not yet fulfilled? Surely God both can and alſo will give mee life and preſerve me from the hands of theſe godleſſe Philiſtins, for how elſe ſhould he fulfill his promiſe to me of giving me ſeed after me? If <hi>Abraham,</hi> I ſay, had thus ſtirred up his faith by ſerious conſideration of Gods power and truth, he had not beene foyled ſo as he was. Let his weakneſſe and failings be our warning, that we may eſcape the evills which he fell into.</p>
            <p>Againe, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was weake and yeelded a little to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,<note place="margin">2. A carnall feare of death.</note> ſo was he poſſeſſed ſomewhat ſtrongly for the time with a kinde of carnall feare of death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.12. and afterwards, <hi>Gen.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>0.13. He ſaid, <hi>they will ſlay mee for my wives ſake.</hi> So you muſt note another weakeneſſe in Gods people, flowing from the former imperfection of faith. They are apt to be over-fearefull of dangers, and by name of death, even to be ſo much terrified with the apprehenſion of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, eſpecially of looſing their lives, that they cannot muſt upon God and reſt upon him for ſafety, as they ſhould doe. This feare was found in <hi>David,</hi> it was found alſo in <hi>Peter,</hi> and in divers others of Gods people. The ground of it is, as I ſaid, partly the weakeneſſe of their faith, and partly the terribleneſſe of death, which is the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleſt of all terrible things, as being a ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, and a ſtripping a man at once of all thoſe things that are moſt deare unto him, and conveighing him out of this world into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; concerning his happineſſe herein he is not alwaies ſo full of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as he ſhould be. For when theſe feares doe ſuddainely ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man, upon occaſion of ſome ſenſible object that threatens him, they pull out of the minde for the time the thought of Gods promiſes, and hold the ſoule alone in the apprehenſion of the greatneſſe and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe of the danger which looketh him in the face.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore learne, not to be heartleſſe our ſelves, becauſe we hare have beene ſo tranſported with feare, as was <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor yet be cenſorious to others, whom wee ſhall ſee thus for a fit even ſhaken and almoſt overcome of feare. It is a fault indeed, and we muſt blame our ſelves for it and be humbled, but it is ſuch a fault, as may ſtand with truth of grace, and which doth not give juſt reaſon to conclude ourſelves unſanctified, or not to be Gods true children.</p>
            <p>And let us learne to beware of feare, to reſiſt and oppoſe it at the beginning by the oppoſition of Gods love and protection; yea, let us labour to worke in our mindes ſuch a true apprehenſion of the harmeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of death and other croſſes, that we may learne not to be afraid of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:27208:72"/>
them, though we muſt needs ſuffer them. For why ſhould we feare that which cannot hurt, yea that which ſhall be an advantage to us, <hi>Feare none of thoſe things that you ſhall ſuffer,</hi> ſaith the Lord, and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will not feare what man can doe unto mee,</hi> and againe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.6. Pſal. 23.4.</note> 
               <hi>I will not feare though I walke in the valley of the ſhadow of death.</hi> It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing and very comfortable, when our heart is ſo ſetled that feare may not diſmay us. And the way is to get aſſurance of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and of eternall life, and that all things ſhall worke for our good, and ſpeedily to ſet this faith on worke, when dangers ſhall offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto our ſight.</p>
            <p>But further, <hi>Abraham</hi> to avoid this danger,<note place="margin">3. He diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</note> conſulted with fleſh and bloud, and uſed deceit, and ſhifting, and falſehood, for though his words were in ſome ſence true, as he telleth <hi>Abimelech,</hi> becauſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> was his ſiſter by one ſide, yet in the meaning which he would have thoſe to interpret his words to whom he ſpake them, they were not true. For his intent was to make them conceive, that ſhe was ſo his ſiſter as not his wife. He reſolved to uſe falſe ſpeeches, and draw his wife likewiſe to joyne with him in theſe falſe ſpeeches, yea they agreed upon it before hand as he tels <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 20.13. Abraham <hi>ſaid to her, this is the kindneſſe thou ſhalt ſhew mee at every place whether wee ſhall come, ſay he is my brother.</hi> You ſee they agreed before hand to diſſemble and to continue diſſembling; yet ſure diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling is a ſinne and ought not to be done, as <hi>Abraham</hi> heares even from <hi>Abimelech</hi> himſelfe, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>Thou haſt done deeds unto mee that ought not to be done.</hi> So it may befall a good <hi>Abraham</hi> out of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderateneſſe and heedleſneſſe in not pondering their pathes, nor thinking of their waies, or in a ſuddaine to diſſemble and deale falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the preventing of danger, as may be ſeene alſo in <hi>David,</hi> and in <hi>Peter,</hi> when he denied Chriſt, and when he withdrew himſelfe from communion with the Gentiles, for feare of them which came from <hi>Iames</hi> to <hi>Antioch.</hi> For a thing not conſidered of, is for preſent as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe as if it were not knowne at all.</p>
            <p>Therefore here alſo we muſt learne not to be utterly diſcouraged, if we have run into ſuch a fault, when we bethinke our ſelves after of ſuch offences, we muſt be humbled, bewaile them, confeſſe them, condemne and judge our ſelves for them, but we muſt not be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of asking pardon, and of intreating mercy to forgive them, muſt not conclude, that there was no truth of grace in us, becauſe of ſuch palpable failings, yea we muſt take boldneſſe to goe to the throne of grace, renewing our repentance, and earneſtly ſuing for pardon.</p>
            <p>And we muſt alſo take heed of cenſuring others, and bitterly and harſhly for ſuch offences, though they be groſſe: even <hi>Abimelech</hi> did not eſteeme <hi>Abraham</hi> a diſhoneſt and naughty man, becauſe he had found him tripping in this matter; onely take heed leaſt we miſuſe this Example and the like, to build upon them a boldneſſe to ſuch ſinnes, that were a great wickedneſſe. They muſt imbolden us to repent and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:27208:73"/>
crave mercy, after we have through weakeneſſe offended, they muſt not imbolden us before hand to reſolve on a ſinfull deed. Yea when we behold their ſtumblings, it ſhould make us to be earneſt in our prayers to God for a great meaſure of ſtrength, that we may eſcape ſuch offences, and to be more frequent and firme in renewing our purpoſes of not finning in the like kinde. Reſolve therefore, that nothing ſhall make you lie or diſſemble, and if you doe reſolve, you will ſeeke pardon and ſtrive to tranſgreſſe no more.</p>

When a man is in perill he doth not likely look about him, to ſee thoſe miſchiefes that will follow the bad courſes he takes, to free himſelfe from the preſent evill.

            <p>But yet note we, that <hi>Abraham</hi> fell into this ſinne once, and againe, and if occaſion had ſerved, was ready to fall into it often, as we have alledged his agreement with <hi>Sarah</hi> before.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">A double ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</note>There is a double ſinne of ignorance. One concerning the fact in generall, when one knowes not that ſuch a thing is unlawfull, the other concerning this particular fact, when I doe not take notice and obſerve that this act of mine is ſuch a ſinne. Often it falls out, that Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren through the ſtrength of ſome paſſion or corruption, as here out of feare, doe not conſider of their particular actions and ſo run often into foule offences out of this particular ignorance, as I may call it, they know the propoſition, deceit is a ſinne, but the aſſumption, this is an act of deceit, is not added for want of conſidering, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conſcience doth not preſſe, this is a deceitfull act, you muſt not doe it. Now when we finde our ſelves upon better conſideration, to have beene carried thus to doe evill, we muſt not be diſmayed but renew our repentance, and reſt on Gods mercy in Chriſt for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and ſo for the future, reſolve to forbeare the ſinne. Alſo we muſt learne, often to conſider of our owne waies leaſt any ſuch faults be found in us. Mans heart is full of blindneſſe and ſelfe-deceit, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he ſhake himſelfe as it were, and examine his waies often in his owne heart, he may live in ſome great offence and not finde it, and though theſe kinds of ſinnes will not hazard his ſalvation, yet they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:27208:73"/>
may bring divers croſſes and miſeries, and much reproach, and give much offence, and procure ſore temptations, and much diſquietment of conſcience to him afterwards: Let us not animate our ſelves to ſinne by the falls of the Saints, but rather worke in our ſelves an holy feare of our ſelves and care of avoiding ſuch ſins.</p>
            <p>Now I come to <hi>Abrahams</hi> laſt ſinne, which was his taking of <hi>Hagar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. <hi>Abraham</hi> had two wives</note> a fault in it ſelfe, for God made one Man and one Woeman, to ſhew, that he would have marriage an individuall ſociety of life betwixt one Man and one Woeman. But that point was not knowne it ſeemes in thoſe times, and therefore both <hi>Sarah</hi> perſwaded her husband, and he condeſcended to take <hi>Hagar.</hi> A good man may live in a few ſinnes of ignorance, and never particularly repent of them. Take we heed therefore of condemning thoſe, who conceiving ſuch and ſuch things not to be ſinnefull, take boldneſſe to live in them. If want of will to ſee the light, make a man to reſiſt the light, offering it ſelfe to his conſcience, becauſe that he will not know, fearefull is ſuch a mans eſtate, and I cannot ſee that this may ſtand with ſanctification. But if want of light or ſtrength of impediments hinder from knowing, wee ſhould not condemne a man that in other things is upright for ſuch faults, onely we muſt labour with God to reveale to us our ſecret faults, that ſo much as maybe, we may free our ſelves from thoſe ſinnes of ignorance, and take heed of taking things on truſt upon the opinion and example even of moſt worthy men.</p>
            <p>Wee goe forward in conſidering <hi>Abrahams</hi> example,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Abrahams</hi> benefits.</note> and muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the benefits which God beſtowed upon him. Theſe are of two ſorts. Firſt, Temporall, then Spirituall.<note place="margin">1. Temporall.</note> The Temporall bleſſings are of two ſorts. Firſt, Thoſe that were given to himſelfe. Secondly, Thoſe that were granted to others for his ſake.</p>
            <p>Firſt for himſelfe,<note place="margin">1. For himſelf.</note> beſides the common benefits of health and ſtrength, and wit, and limbes and the like, which moſt men receive at the hands of God. He gave him firſt a good Wife, <hi>Sarah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. A good wife</note> who was obedient unto him as the Scripture noteth, and did ſhew all reſpect and reverence to him, calling him <hi>Sir,</hi> or <hi>my Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3 6.</note> and though ſhee was a woeman and had her fraileties, yet ſhe was a good and dutifull wife unto him, and in the maine a comfort unto him. <hi>Abraham</hi> had his <hi>Sarah</hi> with whom he lived very comfortably in the ſtate of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and there never fell out that we read of, but one alone diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and brawle betwixt them, which yet by the wiſedome and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was quickly made up and healed.</p>
            <p>Now this benefit muſt be marked as a ſingular and excellent bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,<note place="margin">A good wife a great bleſſing</note> to have a loving, chaſt, dutifull and reſpective wife, is a great bleſſing. All thoſe to whom God hath vouchſafed the ſame mercy, muſt ſee and acknowledge it with all thankfulneſſe. And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that a bad wife is like continuall droppings, and as rottenneſſe in ones bones, and like oyle in his right hand, which will quickly diſcover it ſelfe, we ſhall learne the better to prize and eſteeme this favour. <hi>Hee that obtaineth a wife</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Prov. 9.14.</note> For <hi>houſe and goods be the inheritance of the Fathers, but a good wife is of the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 31.10, 11</note> And <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall find a vertuous woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? her price is above the pearles. The heart of her husband ſhall truſt in her, ſhee will doe him good and not evill all the dayes of his life.</hi> This great benefit the Lord gave unto his ſervant <hi>Abraham.</hi> All therefore that have obtained the like mercy in ſome meaſure, muſt obſerve and valew aright ſo principall a bleſſing. Though a man have an yoake-fellows in ſome things imperfect and weake, yet if ſhe be generally good, will joyne with him in piety as <hi>Sarah</hi> did with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and beare him company in all good things, and will leave houſe and all to journey with him, if God call them forth to any ſervice, it is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall goodneſſe, and a chiefe inſtrument of his comfort and welfare. <hi>Sarah</hi> honoured <hi>Abraham, Sarah</hi> obeyed <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhe was ready to provide a feaſt for the Angels at his appointment, ſhee was a good huſwife and helpefull unto him in the overſeeing of his great family, ſhee was every way contentfull and pleaſing unto him, and a little too obſequious, in being content for his ſake, to ſay ſhe was his ſiſter. Wherefore let this firſt benefit be noted, and let thoſe that have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it with praiſe and thankes to God, and let thoſe that have it not as yet, learne to ſeeke it at Gods hands, knowing his readineſſe to exerciſe his goodneſſe upon all men in all ages, if they feare and obey him, as well as upon <hi>Abraham</hi> in his time.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 He had chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note>Secondly, God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> children alſo. Firſt he had <hi>Iſhmael</hi> by <hi>Hagar,</hi> then in due time he had <hi>Iſaac</hi> by <hi>Sarah,</hi> the ſonne of the promiſe, the ſonne of his old-age, beſides a godly and dutifull ſonne, that inherited the promiſes and the bleſſings with him, and in whom the covenant of God was eſtabliſhed. Hee gave him alſo many other children by <hi>Keturah,</hi> which had alſo children in his life time.</p>
            <p>Children are a bleſſing of God, chiefly if they be good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, willing to be ruled by their parents. Theſe are the inheritance of God, when they grow up as Olive plants round about ones table, and the Pſalmiſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 127.5.</note> bleſſed are they which have their quiver full of them, they ſhall not be aſhamed when they ſpeake with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the gate. Theſe comfort him in their childhood, and are a delight to him when they be young, theſe are a ſtaffe to his old-age. In them his name liveth when his perſon is dead, and they be as it were branches ſpringing from himſelfe as a roote, and making his houſe to flouriſh and be greene. So God bleſſed <hi>Abraham</hi> in the fruite of his body.</p>
            <p>Let all thoſe therefore whom God hath bleſſed with this bleſſing, ſee Gods good hand to them, and praiſe him for it. Indeed to be a parent of many and towardly children, if it lift up the heart to God, and occaſion our hearty thankefulneſſe unto the Lord, is a ſpeciall favour. Thoſe that have it muſt ſee Gods good hand in it, and thoſe that have it not, muſt ſeeke it of God, and walke before him obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently, that they may be capeable of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:27208:74"/>Next, God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> good ſervants,<note place="margin">3 He had good ſervants, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially one.</note> for they all hazarded themſelves for and with him in the battaile fought with foure victorious Kings, and helped him to redeeme his brother <hi>Lot</hi> out of captivity, and ſubmitted to be circumciſed, and to be taught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. Had they not beene loving and couragious, <hi>Abraham</hi> could not have accompliſhed his deſire for his kinſmans deliverance. But eſpecially he had one exceeding faithfull ſervant, religious, diligent, diſcreete, carefull of his buſineſſe, and one in whom he might put his truſt for the well ordering of his goods, and for the diſpatch of any affaires committed to him. You ſee his carriage in the 24. of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> He was cautelous and warie in taking of his oath, and would not ſweare raſhly, He was carefull in obſerving his oath after he had taken it. He made uſe of his maſters goods, and the power which his maſter had given him over his family and goods, to finiſh well that great worke of taking a wife for <hi>Iſaac.</hi> He commended the matter to God with earneſt prayer. He followed it thoroughly, and brought it to paſſe effectually. He made a good choice for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and made haſt to returne to his maſter, and bring him backe the fruit of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with good ſucceſſe. No doubt it was a great joy of heart to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> when he ſaw <hi>Eliezer</hi> returning with ſo good ſpeed from <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> and bringing backe with him ſo ſweet and choice a Virgin for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> according to the earneſt deſire of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let all maſters marke Gods dealing with them in their ſervants, and if he pleaſe to ſtore them with many good ſervants, or with one or two alone, of excellent parts and graces, let them even praiſe God for it, conſidering how great a vexation it is, to be croſſed with ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of a contrary diſpoſition, which will be unto him even as ſmoake in his eyes, and as vineger to his teeth. And let all that deſire ſuch a bleſſing, take the ſame courſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> did, that is, labour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be good maſters, and to command and teach their ſervants to feare God as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and to ſhew themſelves loving, kind and liberall to them.</p>
            <p>But further, <hi>Abraham</hi> had a good kinſman <hi>Lot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. <hi>Abraham</hi> had good kinſmen. 1. <hi>Lot.</hi>
               </note> that conſented to beare him company in a holy pilgrimage, and was eaſily wonne by his wiſe dealing, to keepe peace and amity with him, though ſome little breach began, yet it was ſoone made up betwixt them, and <hi>Lot</hi> and he lived in good peace and concord together. No doubt this alſo gladded <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart, and proved a ſpeciall conſolation unto him. If God have given any man ſuch a religious and godly Couſin or Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, let him make much of him, and be a kind Kinſman as <hi>Abraham</hi> was. Yea the Brother of <hi>Abraham,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Nahor.</hi>
                  </note> Nahor</hi> though he continued in the land of <hi>Aram,</hi> and went not out with <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet was in his kind a good Kinſman too, for he rejoyced to heare of <hi>Abrahams</hi> wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and intertained his ſervant courteouſly, and moſt readily ſent his daughter to him, ſo long a journey into a farre countrey, to be a yoake-fellow to <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſonne, to the no ſmall comfort of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> both. Herein he ſhewed mercy and truth to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:27208:75"/>
ſervant ſpake, and did the office of a good and loving Brother. If God afford ſuch bleſſings to any, that he hath a loving wife and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Brother, ready to gratifie and comfort him, he muſt obſerve it with thankes, and thoſe that would have the good hand of God to ſtirre up their Bretheren to ſhew them due reſpect, muſt even walke upright and before God, that he may reward them as he rewarded <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. <hi>Abraham</hi> had faithfull friends.</note>But another bleſſing <hi>Abraham</hi> had too, he met with very faithfull friends who were confederate with him, and did moſt carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the conditions of friendſhip and amity, for you ſee they did readily joyne with him, and helped him in his warre againſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named conquering kings, and were inſtruments by their valour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme <hi>Lot,</hi> and to vanquiſh thoſe conquerours. This is a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable benefit, to have true and truſty friends and allies, that will ſticke to him in his need, and hazard themſelves for him, and joyne with him in his good cauſe, and not prove like unto a leg out of joynt, or a broken tooth when occaſion ſerves to imploy them and uſe their labour, or hazard for his benefit. Doe you not think that <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoyced in the fidelity and amity of his aſſociates. Doe you not thinke that he bleſſed God for it, and did account himſelfe very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in enjoying three ſuch noble and worthy confederates. Let us encourage our ſelves to obey God, and to forſake our country and kindred at his command, for cannot he repay and repaire that loſſe eaſily? by raiſing us up even in a ſtrange countrey, thoſe that ſhall as heartily love us, and as faithfully cleave to us, as any kinſmen in the world. Feare not to forſake friends for Gods ſake, for hee can eaſily cauſe you to find as good in a ſtrange countrey, if need ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, as any you may leave behind you in your owne countrey. And if any have in his owne countrey or abroad met with ſuch friends, he muſt attribute it to the wiſe and good providence of God over him, and with ſolid and ſincere praiſes acknowledge it, carrying himſelfe friendly alſo to them, and ſhewing himſelfe as willing to grant a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to them in fit ſeaſon, as ever he was to receive a benefit from them,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.24.</note> for <hi>hee that hath friends,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, must behave himſelfe friendly.</hi> Let us yet conſider another mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. <hi>Abraham</hi> had a good name.</note>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> had good eſteeme and reputation, an honeſt and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable name amongſt the men of <hi>Heth</hi> where he lived, ſo that they all loved and reſpected him, as appeareth. <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> loved him and came out to meet him and bleſſed him, and gave him bread and wine for himſelfe and for his troupes, <hi>Abimelech</hi> uſed him curteouſly, and though <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> both had ſomewhat too groſſely overſhot themſelves, in diſſembling that <hi>Sarah</hi> was his wife, and that way indangered him to a great ſinne, and brought ſome heavy hand of God upon him and his houſe; yet he ſhew'd himſelfe affable and bountifull, reſtoring him his wife, and not ſo alone, but giving him gifts, and commanding his people to forbeare all injurious car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to him and his wife, and granting him leave to dwell where he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:27208:75"/>
would in his countrey, and after repairing to him, deſiring his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he acknowledged that God had bleſſed him and was with him, and requeſted that a Covenant might be made betwixt them two, and that in the ſolemneſt manner. Was not this a ſigne of great reſpect and love in him to <hi>Abraham?</hi> and was it not a ſingular comfort and credit to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and a ſigne of Gods great favour to him, to incline the heart of ſuch a perſon to him? Yea in what repute and credit he lived, appeareth in that the <hi>Hittites</hi> honoured him, called him a Prince of God, and were ready to give him leave to make uſe of any of their choiſeſt Sepulchers to burie his wife in, and <hi>Ephron</hi> the <hi>Hittite</hi> a man of good eſteeme amongſt them, at firſt word did frankely offer to give him his field, which he deſired, and at firſt condiſcended to ſell it him for a reaſonable price. So God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> good will and credit where he came and amongſt all even high and low.</p>
            <p>Let this alſo encourage all men to ſerve and obey God. He can give them a good name and good favour every where, vertue, piety, and goodneſſe ſhall winne good eſteeme and kindneſſe from men that be not utterly ſlaves to ſinne, ſo farre as it is good for Gods people to enjoy. They muſt indeed, (if God ſee fit to try them by that croſſe) endure diſgrace and hatred, and cauſeleſſe malice and reproach, but ſo farre as Gods Wiſdome judgeth it beneficiall for them, he both can and will incline the hearts of all to reſpect and regard them, to love and honour them. He will make them to be honoured and favoured of all with whom they live. Feare not therefore to ſerve God, but cleave to him and obey him, you ſee his bounty how he can and will requite his faithfull ſervants.</p>
            <p>And thoſe that finde the good hand of God going with them in this kinde, that they be reſpectfully and kindly entertained, that they have a good name and loving kindneſſe with all men, except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome vile and baſe perſons, that they be cordially and heartily loved, that men ſpeake well of them, wiſh and doe well to them, and are glad and ready to gratifie them, they muſt acknowledge Gods goodneſſe in this mercy and rejoyce in his love, that doth turne the hearts of men unto them, and praiſe, honour and love him the more, for the praiſe, honour and love they receive in the world. We muſt prepare our ſelves to meete with ill uſage, ill will, ill language, but when wee meete with good, then we muſt confeſſe, that the Lord our God is the ruler of all hearts, and bleſſe his name that cauſeth us to finde favour with men, as <hi>David</hi> did with <hi>Saul</hi> at firſt, with all <hi>Iſrael</hi> and with <hi>Achiſh</hi> one of the Philiſtine Lords, King of <hi>Gath,</hi> that gave him honourable entertainement in his Court.</p>
            <p>Now another temporall bleſſing we obſerve to be granted to this good man, and it is three or foure times noted in Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.2. Abraham <hi>was very rich in ſilver, cattell, and gold.</hi> So <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.35. <hi>The Lord hath bleſſed my Maſter greatly, and he is become great, and hee hath given him flockes and heards, and ſilver and gold, and men ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:27208:76"/>
and maide ſervants and Camells and Aſſes,</hi> and 25.6. Abraham <hi>gave gifts to the ſonnes of his Concubines.</hi> He could not have inriched them, if he had not beene rich himſelfe; So God fulfilled his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he was a very rich man as well as very good. Riches are in Gods hand, hee hath them in abundance; He is able and ready to grant them to his ſervants: Indeed they be but doubtfull bleſſings, if a man have not power to uſe them well, they will be more hurtfull to him then profitable. But ſo farre as the perfect wiſedome of God ſees that they will be beneficiall to them, wiſedome ſhall bring them alſo in her hand and fill the houſes of her admirers with them alſo.</p>
            <p>Let Gods people learne therefore to truſt upon him for their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate; for though he make not all his children rich, for it is not good for all, yet he will not ſee the meaneſt of them to ſtarve, for then he ſhould not anſwer that bountifull and mercifull title of a Father, by which he loveth that his ſervants ſhould call him and call upon him. Incourage your ſelves therefore in all holineſſe, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and vertues, for ſure the Lord that filled the houſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> and made him ſo wealthie and great a man, will not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to give you foode convenient for you, and to ſupply you with neceſſaries.</p>
            <p>And let thoſe that have houſes, goods, and wealth in abundance, learne to uſe them well, to ſee it is Gods gift, and to uſe them as ſtewards, to praiſe God for them, to make them a meanes of knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their hearts more ſure and faſt to him in love and obedience; and to imploy them bountifully, liberally, and mercifully as <hi>Abraham</hi> no doubt did, that they may lay up treaſure for themſelves in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that by well-doing they make them friends of the riches of iniquity. Wealth honeſtly gotten, mercifully and bountifully uſed and moderately enjoyed, is a great mercy of God. If God make you rich, doe you ſhew your ſelves to be good as well as rich, or elſe riches doe not make a man the better that hath them, neither can they make his life much more comfortable; yea it doth appeare of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that <hi>riches are laid up for the owners thereof for hurt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe be the benefits temporall which <hi>Abraham</hi> had for himſelfe, a good wife, good children in their kinde, and one religious, good ſervants, good friends, good name, good favour and great wealth, to which add one particular benefit, a great and famous victory over foure great and conquering Kings,<note place="margin">A great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous victory.</note> as the Holy Ghoſt telleth us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.15. he purſued them, he divided himſelfe againſt them he and his ſervants by night, and ſmote them and purſued them to <hi>Hobah,</hi> and brought backe all the goods, and <hi>Lot</hi> his brother and his goods and the women and his people. An abſolute victory was obtained by <hi>Abrahams</hi> wiſedome and valour, God gave him the wiſdome, God gave him the valour, God gave him the ſucceſſe. The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſets forth Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> in generall, as a ſure argument, that God will
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:27208:76"/>
ſhew the like mercies to his people in after times, bidding them looke unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.2. <hi>I called him, I bleſſed him and increaſed him,</hi> and 41.2, 3. He ſetteth forth this very benefit in magnificall phraſes, ſaying, <hi>who raiſed up the righteous man from the Eaſt?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 41.2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>called him to his foot? gave the nations before him and made him rule over Kings? gave them as duſt to his ſword? as driven ſtubble to his bow; hee purſued them and paſſed ſafely by the way that he had not gone with his feete.</hi> God would have his people take notice of this mercy in ſaving <hi>Abraham,</hi> and making him victorious, to aſſure them of his like love in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, and giving them victory over all their enemies, even the whole Church, and each particular member thereof. He that ſheltered <hi>Abraham,</hi> was with him, gave Kings before him, ſhall not he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his love as much in future ages to his people? Surely he is the ſame for ever. Let this comfort us againſt all thoſe that riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
            <p>But what did God for others for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſake? Firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <p n="2">2. God did doe good to others for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſake.</p>

            <p>Thus you ſee, how worth the while it is to ſerve, feare, and obey God, what abundant bleſſings he grants, what honour and ſame even after death; though all Gods people have not all theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things in like manner beſtowed upon them, yet they have that which is ſufficient for them, and thoſe that finde their friends and children happy in outward reſpects, muſt obſerve Gods hand to be thankfull.</p>
            <p>Yea we muſt all take notice of Gods like dealing with many of his people, whoſe poſterity flouriſh when they be dead, ſome in goodneſſe as well as goods, and ſome at leaſt in earthly reſpects, and leave a good name behinde them, ſo that many yeares after their

No greater bleſſing can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall a man here, then to be called from a falſe religion to the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſo that his heart be inclined alſo to the practiſe of the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that he be effectually ſanctified as was <hi>Abraham.</hi> Wee muſt looke that wee have this mercy of effectuall calling; Indeed from Idols and ſuch kinde of falſe gods, wee are called, or rather we have beene kept from following them at all, but ah, are we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to walke before God in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe? not alone turning from darkeneſſe to light, from a falſe religion to the true, but <hi>from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> that is, from ſerving the Divell in a wicked life to ſerve God in an holy life. If we be not ſo called, we are not ſonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and outward bleſſings will doe us little good. If we be, then wee have cauſe to rejoyce before the Lord our God with exceeding great joy, for he that is ſo called, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie is he. This is a mercy of mercies, to be a Saint by calling, one whom God hath ſo wrought upon by his Spirit, that his outward call hath wonne him from the ſtate of corruption to the ſtate of grace.</p>

goe into a Countrey which God ſhould ſhew him, promiſing him large off-ſpring, great bleſſings, and that the promiſed and bleſſed ſeed ſhould come of him: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.8.</note> that God preached the Goſpell before to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>in thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed,</hi> ſo that he was more largely inſtructed by God of remiſſion of ſinnes and ſalvation everlaſting by one that was to be borne of him. Now God cauſed him alſo to beleeve theſe promiſes, ſo that he left his Fathers worſhip and obeyed God. If any of us have had the Word of God preached in our eares, and by name the promiſes of the Goſpell, and hath found his heart ſo affected with thoſe promiſes, and the true beliefe of them, that it hath made him follow God in a holy converſation of life, and leave his former ſinnes, travell towards the land of life, that land which God had ſhewed him in the paths of righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, this is effectuall calling, happy and bleſſed is this man. Rejoyce in this calling, and bleſſe God for it more then for all earthly things whatſoever. And if any of you be not as yet ſo called, let him ſee his miſery, and now call upon God ſo to call him, till he finde his prayers granted: for if we turne to God he will turne to us, and if we ſeeke to him for the performance of his gratious Covenant in putting his Spirit of Sanctification in our hearts, he will not faile to doe it.</p>
            <p>But a ſecond ſpirituall bleſſing was 1.<note place="margin">2. Spirituall bleſſings.</note> He gave him moſt gratious promiſes. 2.

            <p>And yet more fully aſſuring him of his goodneſſe by entring

And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. hee appeareth unto him againe in forme of a man, and tells him the particular time of the childs birth, and acquaints him with his purpoſe concerning the overthrow of <hi>Sodom.</hi> And laſt of all, after he had offered <hi>Iſaac</hi> hee appeares unto him againe, and by an oath confirmes to him the former bleſſings, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16. which hee had never done before. This is a ſingular mercy to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to give him ſo many promiſes, to renew them ſo often to him, and confirme them ſo ſtrongly to him. And you muſt looke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God vouchſafe to ſhew himſelfe thus to you, even to bring home to your ſoules in the reading and hearing of his word, and exerciſes of religion, the gracious promiſes of his word, giving you by his Spirit aſſurance that hee admittteth you into the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is your God, pardons you, bleſſeth you, and will give you all needfull things for ſoule and body, and make you partakers of eternall felicity. All Gods ſervants that are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> have this holy communion with God in his word, in prayer, in his ordinances, which <hi>Abraham</hi> had in theſe dreames and viſions: for to the Fathers God ſhewed himſelfe by thoſe meanes, to us by theſe, and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>that his Father and hee will come and ſhew themſelves unto thoſe that love him and keepe his commandements, and ſuppe with them.</hi> O if you find this ſpirituall familiarity with God, how happy are you.

And now ſeeke you, ſeeke you theſe ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, Gods aſſuring you of pardon of ſinne, and appearing unto you more and more to confirme your faith in the promiſes of the Goſpell, and to make you aſſured of your eternall happineſſe, and that he is your God, untill at length he do even as it were ſweare it unto you, and make you certaine of it?</p>
            <p>And Bretheren, be you incouraged to anſwer Gods call, to repent, to live holily, to caſt of your ſinnes and become obedient as was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> for though perhaps you may not be ſo rich as he, nor have ſo many childeren, nor have ſo great outward favours, yet will God be your God, he will be your ſhield, he will be your reward, hee will bleſſe you in all things, he will give you the inheritance of life eternall, as ſure as he did to <hi>Abraham;</hi> he will heare and accept your prayers, and he will bring you ſafe to the land of reſt, to Heaven that true reſt, where you ſhall have no more unquietneſſe inward nor out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome will he receive all thoſe, that be the true ſonnes of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Learne to eſteeme of theſe ſpirituall bleſſings, though perhaps they
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:27208:78"/>
may be ſeparated from the temporall, God therefore alone divideth them becauſe he ſees you be not fit for both, but would be hindered from injoying the one and growing in the one, by the overfull enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other. But the better I ſay you ſhall ſurely have as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> God will more and more aſſure you of his favour, and of his kingdome, and ſhew himſelfe more and more graciouſly unto you, in confirming to you his comfortable promiſes more and more. This is better then all the riches of the whole world; If <hi>Abraham</hi> had enjoyed this whole world and not this ſweete entercourſe with God, his life would not have beene halfe ſo comfortable and happy, but if his eſtate had bin never ſo poore and meane in outward things, yet would this ſweete fellowſhip with his Maker have made him happy and bleſſed enough. Spirittuall good things are the chiefe and principall, bleſſed is the man whom God pleaſeth to take for his owne, to call to himſelfe, to ſtrengthen in faith, to make more and more certaine of his ſalvation. This is the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> that comes unto the Gentiles by faith in Jeſus Chriſt. This poore and afflicted Saints enjoy as well as rich; This ſeeke, this labour for, by indeavouring to walke with God, and by being upright.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, But alas I want this, I find not God ſhewing himſelfe to me in his ordinances, I find him not ſetling my heart.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, If hee have called thee out of ſinne to a good life, and that thou indeavoureſt to follow him, he will in due time ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto thee, feare it not, and the longer he ſeemes to deferre the revealing of himſelfe, the more abundant and exceeding great ſhall the comfort be at laſt. God will not faile to bleſſe his people with ſpirituall bleſſings, and comfort them with ſpirituall comforts, if they walke before him in ſincerity.</p>
            <p>I proceed to tell you of good <hi>Abrahams</hi> croſſes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Abrahams</hi> croſſes.</note> which if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> were much greater then his, if with <hi>Iacobs</hi> they ſeeme in ſome reſpects much leſſe. But if you conſider them ſimply, they were ſome of them exceeding heavy to beare. Wee will ranke them into a certaine order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God put him to ſuffer an heavy croſſe at his firſt call,<note place="margin">1. He changed his countrey and left his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe.</note> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times alſo he doth many of his ſervants. His kindred and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe were all Idolaters, and God ſaw that he ſhould have had much adoe to have maintained himſelfe and the truth of his religion, if he ſhould have continued amongſt them. Wherefore hee cauſed him to leave that place, and thoſe perſons, and to goe into another land which he ſhould ſhew him, according as in the Pſalme, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeakes to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.10.</note> 
               <hi>forſake thy kindred and thy fathers houſe,</hi> and this affliction often aſſaileth the Saints of God, at their looking towards true piety, when they begin to forſake ſinnefull cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and to looke towards Heaven; though they change not their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie for a new habitation, nor leave their fathers houſe to goe into a region farre diſtant, yet their fathers houſe falleth out with them, they ceaſe to be friends to them, and they feele that which ſometimes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:27208:79"/>
our Lord hath foretold,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.36.</note> 
               <hi>a mans enemies ſhall be thoſe of his owne houſe,</hi> yea father hates the ſonne, and the ſonne the Father. For a mans inward and neereſt friends are more weary of him then, then any other, becauſe having occaſion of converſing with him, they more ſee his piety, elſe as Owles are more offended with the light, and becauſe wanting that commerce in evill and vanity which once they had, they are more diſpleaſed at the change.</p>
            <p>We muſt learne therefore whoſoever mindeth to follow Chriſt and be his Diſciple, learne to love him above all perſons, yea as himſelfe teacheth us, to hate Father and Mother, even to hate them I ſay; that is, to be willing to part with them, as if we hated them for Chriſts ſake. And as here the Lord ſo provided for <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no friend in any place where ever he came, a forreine countrey afforded him as much welfare as his native ſoile could have done, ſo whoſoever ſhall looſe any ſuch thing for Chriſts ſake, ſhall be ſure to receive in this life an 100. fold, that is, an hundred times more good and comfort, then thoſe things or perſons could have afforded, yea many times alſo a larger meaſure, and greater number of outward things and outward friends.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt croſſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> leaving his countrey, ſee next what he met with in <hi>Canaan</hi> another countrey, in reſpect of his eſtate and the perſons that were deareſt to him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine where he ſhould dwell.</note>Firſt for his eſtate, God gave him no poſſeſſion, no not the bredth of a foote, but made him travaile up and downe in tents, without either certaine houſe or any inheritance. This is a croſſe too, and a thing little pleaſing to fleſh and bloud, to be of a fleeting condition, not knowing where he ſhall dwell next month or next yeare, to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out houſe or home, that he can call his owne; by which God taught <hi>Abraham,</hi> to uſe the world as though he uſed it not, and to ſet his heart more upon the things above, becauſe he had ſo little ſetledneſſe in the things below. The people of God muſt be content to be row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as it were up and downe from place to place, to be in the Earth as in a Sea, in which they ſhall be toſſed now hither now thither, and have no fixed dwelling almoſt, and our Lord Chriſt after he was a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, was accuſtomed to ſuch a kind of Pilgrims life, now in <hi>Iudea,</hi> now in <hi>Galilee,</hi> now in <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> now in <hi>Cana,</hi> now in <hi>Decapolis,</hi> hee had not an houſe to lay his head in. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was likewiſe accuſtomed amongſt other miſeries, to beare this, of having no certaine dwelling place. If God call any of us to ſuch a condition, it muſt not ſeeme much to us, to eate the bread of ſuch worthy men, nor to pledge them in the ſame cup. Hee whoſe ſoule is not glewed to the world, can well endure this kind of tumbling, none other will, unleſſe hee be a man that loves to wander.</p>

               </note>Now for the perſons neere to him, firſt, his Kinſman, then thoſe of his family. One and onely one Kinſman he had with him, that wee reade of, <hi>Lot.</hi> In him he ſuffered two troubleſome croſſes. Firſt, upon occaſion of a trouble that fell out betwixt the ſervants of <hi>Lot</hi> and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:27208:79"/>
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they were faine to part habitations. Their riches were ſo great, that the land affoorded not roome for both their herds and flockes, hence the herdſmen and ſhepheards on both ſides had occaſion of jarring about places of paſture. One would have his cattle here, another would have his, and ſo variance grew. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſaw that this variance would proceed farther and farther, and to prevent miſchiefe, gives <hi>Lot</hi> his choice where hee would dwell, ſo ſaith the Scripture, <hi>they were ſeparated a man from his brother.</hi> This no doubt was tedious to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>Lot</hi> and he might not be neere neighbours at once, for the event after made it appeare how deare <hi>Lot</hi> was unto him, and therefore after <hi>Lots</hi> departure, the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto <hi>Abraham</hi> to comfort him, as taking notice what a trouble it was unto him. And this kinde of croſſe doth fall out to men, either increaſe of riches or want of it, or ſome thing falleth out, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth they muſt be ſeparated from their ſpeciall friends, or ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe and jarres grow betwixt them, that their agreement is not ſo cordiall and hearty as it ought to be.</p>
            <p>But the next Croſſe in <hi>Lot</hi> was worſe, for in the ſpoile of <hi>Sodome,</hi> he was ſpoiled and taken captive by thoſe that tooke the <hi>Sodomites</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. This comming to <hi>Abrahams</hi> eares pierced him indeed, that his loving Couſin who had beene brought up in his houſe with him, and had borne him company in all his peregrination from <hi>Vr</hi> till al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that time, ſhould fall into the hands of ſo cruell enemies, ſhould have his cattell and goods ſeized upon, and himſelfe, and wife, and children, made ſlaves and bondmen. This affliction is uſuall enough in the world. Much miſery and diſtreſſe befalls them to whom wee wiſh well, and we ſuffer in their ſufferings whom naturall affection doth ſo indeere us unto, as that wee cannot but have a fellow-feeling with them in their diſtreſſes, as the members of the body ſuffer by conſent.</p>
            <p>But a ſecond evill that I had almoſt forgotten pinched <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Lot,</hi> for <hi>Lot</hi> loſt all in <hi>Sodome</hi> and went and dwelt in the Mount, and there lay with his two daughters, and begat of each of them a ſonne. This was no doubt noiſed abroad, it came to <hi>Abrahams</hi> eares, and filled his heart with a great deale of griefe, that ſuch a man as he had taken <hi>Lot</hi> to be and found him to be, after God had afflicted and chaſtened him, and alſo ſhewed him mercy and delivered him, ſhould runne into ſo monſtrous and unnaturall ſinnes, as to commit inceſt, not with one of his daughters which had beene farre too much, but even with both of them, one after the other. This I ſay pierced <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſoule to thinke of, he could not but be ſenſible of all the bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull taunts that the true religion of God would ſuffer for this crime of <hi>Lot.</hi> The ſinnes and crimes of thoſe that are deare to us, and the reproach that followes thence, both upon themſelves and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon the truth of God which they profeſſe, muſt needs breede much heavineſſe unto good men, and ſometimes the providence of God ſo diſpoſeth of things, that the people of God ſhall be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſo, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith God would humble him he feared, when he
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:27208:80"/>
ſhould finde many impenitent ſinners in <hi>Corinth,</hi> and it had brought anguiſh to his heart, that the inceſtuous man had not alone ſo ſhamefully offended, but alſo beene tolerated by the Church, as no doubt alſo the heare-ſay of <hi>Rubens</hi> inceſt was a great vexation of heart to <hi>Iacob,</hi> when the report of it was brought unto him.</p>
            <p>Now ſee what <hi>Abraham</hi> ſuffered in his owne houſe in reſpect of his wives and children.<note place="margin">4. His wife <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> was twice taken away from him.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, his wife <hi>Sarah</hi> a good woman and deare to him, was twice taken away from him, once by the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and after by the King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> and he could not but be grieved at it ſo much the more, becauſe it came to paſſe by his owne default and ſinne, and becauſe ſhee was ſo taken away, as that it was likely every day, that ſhee ſhould have beene married to another man, or at leaſt have beene made a miniſter to ſerve his luſt. What an anguiſh was this thinke you? How did this gaule his heart? when he abode alone in his Tent, and <hi>Sarah</hi> was not in hers, when he lay alone at home and <hi>Sarah</hi> bare him not company, yea when ſhee was perhaps in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of another man, to whom he had betrayed her by his cowardly feares and diſſembling, it ſcarce befalleth any of us to meete with ſuch a croſſe in his wife.</p>
            <p>

To be child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is a croſſe wherewith ſome are exerciſed, but to <hi>Abraham</hi> it was a worſe croſſe then ordinary, becauſe the want of a childe was to him the want of ſalvation too, for himſelfe and all Nations were to be bleſſed in his ſeede: So that if hee had had no ſonne, hee could have had no Heaven, and nothing ſtood as a ſtronger objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his being ſaved, then his being childleſſe.

This ſounded harſhly in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> eares, and this language was tedious, to be ſo rated by <hi>Sarah,</hi> it made him thinke the caſe ſtrangely altered. Indeed he by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome calmed the tempeſt very ſoone, it continued not long, but it was a ſoure thing for the time; many a man hath the ſame trouble for matter, but more frequent and more laſting. A wives paſſions are an

husbands ſufferings, her anger and diſcontent and brawles with maides and men and children ſometimes fall upon him, and ſhee is ready cauſeleſly to quarrell with him, when ſhe is diſpleaſed with them, this croſſe is ſo much the more tedious, by how much a man doth more affect and love his wife, and ſometimes too it is aggravated by this, that hee hath ſome way beene an occaſion of it though unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, <hi>Abraham</hi> buried <hi>Sarah,</hi> ſhe died before him,<note place="margin">7. <hi>Sarah</hi> died before him.</note> and he was faine to part with her unto the duſt. This calamity falleth upon many men to bury their wives, but to many it is not a calamity, they know how very quickly to make this affliction nothing, by a ſpeedy brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in of another: but to <hi>Abraham</hi> who loved <hi>Sarah</hi> and had long lived with her, it muſt needes be matter of ſorrow, and ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture witneſſeth ſaying, <hi>Hee roſe up from before his dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 23.3.</note> 
               <hi>whether hee had gone before to mourne and weepe for her.</hi> Theſe things he ſuffered in his wife <hi>Sarah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in his Concubine <hi>Hagar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">8. He ſuffered in <hi>Hagars</hi> ill carriage to <hi>Sarah,</hi> and in her running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way being with-child.</note> firſt her ill carriage to <hi>Sarah</hi> was ſurely a griefe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when two ſuch perſons fall at oddes, hee that is a common friend to both ſuffers in both. The cuſtome of Poligamie is weeded out of the Chriſtian world, ſo that men now are happier then to be vexed with the mutuall brawling of two Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, as I may call them: but now the contentions of neere friends do fall out ſomewhat bitter ſometimes, to them that love both ſo well that they know not where to take part.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When ſhee was now great by him, ſhe ran away from him and <hi>Sarah,</hi> and carried the fruite of his body away with her. This no doubt grieved <hi>Abraham,</hi> he tooke her alone for deſire of of-ſpring, not to ſatisfie luſtfull deſires, and now when ſhe promiſed ſeede, and his heart was raiſed up with expectation of a ſonne, to have all his hopes daſhed by the quarrels that <hi>Sarah</hi> had with her, ſhe being gone away, and hee knowing not where to have her, nor how to procure her returne, nor what was become of her, nor of his child where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe went, and which was deare unto him, even now before he ſaw it in the world. This ſurely put him to much griefe and ſorrow. This croſſe is not very uſuall, to have a great bellied wife runne from a man, but if ſuch a kind of deſertion ſhall befall any, either hee muſt be very reſpectleſſe of his wife, or elſe it would be a corraſive unto him.</p>
            <p>But a worſe croſſe or as bad befell him after,<note place="margin">9. Hee was made to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce <hi>Hagar</hi> and ſend her quite away.</note> for at laſt the Lord made him to divorce <hi>Hagar,</hi> and to ſend her quite away, never againe to live with him. This was as bad and worſe then to burie her. If God do even ſeparate a mans wife from him, either his affection to her is little, or elſe his griefe for her will be much, but hee had <hi>Sarah</hi> his firſt wife, and that ſerved to mitigate the putting away of his ſuperadded woeman.</p>
            <p>So you ſee his domeſticall afflictions in his wife, now conſider what hee ſuffered in his childeren, 1. In <hi>Iſhmael</hi> whom hee had firſt,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:27208:81"/>
hee was faine to baniſh him,<note place="margin">10. Hee was forced to thruſt <hi>Iſhmael</hi> out of his family.</note> or excommunicate him whether you will, or both, this was an hard thing to him, hee had but two ſonnes and now hee muſt thruſt one out of his family for ought that hee knew, never to ſee him againe. Hee muſt adventure him to the wide world, and ſend him abroad with his mother, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of reaſon to ſtarve or begge hee knew not whether. Would it not grieve and trouble any of you? to ſend a pretty youth about a douzen or ten yeares old out of his houſe, without any thing but a bag and a bottle, not knowing what hee would doe, or whether hee muſt goe: yet God tried <hi>Abraham</hi> thus, hee muſt learne to truſt Gods word without meanes and above hope. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was, that God would make him a great man, and now God began to performe promiſe, by ſeeming to make him a begger; If God ſeeme to threaten us with beggerie in our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, wee muſt conſider, that ſuch a croſſe ſeemed to bee ruſhing upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> but God found meanes to make that ſonne great, to whom hee was not ſuffered to give any thing, that it might be made evident, that it is eaſie with God to inrich a man caſt out and deſtitute of all friends.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">11. Hee was croſſed in <hi>Iſaac</hi> many wayes.</note>But <hi>Abraham</hi> had another ſonne, ſee the croſſes that befell him in <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Firſt hee waited long for him before hee had him. To be long deferred from enjoying a thing promiſed and hoped for, is a burden ſomewhat tedious, if a man have not faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in ſome good meaſure and quantity. Thus God tried <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> hee lived twenty five yeares after the promiſe of a large of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, before he imbraced the ſame which the promiſe pointed to. How could wee brooke the deferring of a promiſe twenty five yeares?</p>
            <p>But when hee had him, was the laſt triall and worſt of all; hee muſt take him and ride with him a long journey of three dayes to a certaine mountaine, and there hee muſt offer him up to God for a burnt offering, here God tried <hi>Abraham</hi> to the quicke. Hee muſt denie naturall affection, in killing a ſonne ſo deare unto him, and that at this age: If God ſee fit to have him, why did hee not call for him when hee was a young childe, before hee had filled his heart with ſo intenſe love and earneſt expectation; If hee will have him now, why cannot hee ſend ſome diſeaſe to fetch him, but the Father muſt murder the ſonne: ſo nature muſt give place to Gods commandement. Hee muſt alſo denie his credit in the world, and expoſe himſelfe to moſt harſh, and in ſhew juſt cenſure of all men, yea of his familie and of his wife <hi>Sarah</hi> too, whoſe griefe for her ſlaughtered ſonne muſt needes cauſe her to lade her husband with grievous complaints, and in appearance alſo righteous. Yea hee muſt in ſome ſence contradict and croſſe even faith it ſelfe, by ſlaying him in whom the Lord had ſaid unto him. <hi>In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeede be called.</hi> Thus faith muſt conquer nature, conquer credit, and conquer it ſelfe,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:27208:81"/>
which alſo it did in <hi>Abraham:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.19.</note> For <hi>hee conſidered that God was able to raiſe him up againe from the dead, from whence in a figure hee had received him.</hi> So it ſeemeth good to God, to put his ſervanrs hard to it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch things at their hands, as cannot but bee very difficult unto them.</p>

Having therefore ſet before you the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> wee proceede to conſider the example of <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife. Let us ſee 1. Her birth, 2. Her life, 3. Her death.</p>
            <p>Concerning her birth, her Father is knowne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sarahs</hi> birth.</note> her Mother is not knowne.

So was ſhe 10. yeares younger then himſelfe, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded her in age 10. yeares, as it is meete though not neceſſary, that the husband be ſomewhat elder then his wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.5. <hi>Abraham
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:27208:83"/>
was a hundred yeares old when his ſonne</hi> Iſaac <hi>was borne to him. Gen.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Shall</hi> Sarah <hi>that is ninety yeares old beare?</hi> ſo it is manifeſt, that there was the difference of ten yeares betwixt <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi> And this is all we have to ſay of her Birth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Her life.</note>Now concerning her life, wee will looke into her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage good and bad, and then to the things that befell her good and bad.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Her vertues 1. Her faith.</note>Firſt then for that which was good in her, in reſpect of God, man, and her ſelfe. For God, ſhee is commended for her faith, for the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> telleth us,<note place="margin">Heb 11.11.</note> 
               <hi>That by faith ſhee received ſtrength to conceive ſeede, and was delivered of a ſonne when ſhee was paſt age, becauſe ſhee was perſwaded that hee was faithfull which had promiſed,</hi> where you ſee the nature of faith, it is an acknowledging of Gods faithfullneſſe, a giving him the honour of his faith, and <hi>ſetting to ones ſeale that God is true.</hi> Faith cauſeth the minde of a man to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it ſelfe to the Word of God, and to be aſſured that hee can and will keepe promiſe, for to the promiſe of God it looketh principally, and this faith will cauſe a man to receive power from God to doe thoſe things, which otherwiſe of himſelfe he wanted all power to doe. This faith will make a weake man ſtrong, it will put fruitfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into a barren wombe, and life and ſtrength into a dead body, it will make a barren ſoule fruitfull in good workes, and make the heart to conceive the Word ſo as to bring forth the fruit of good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, whereto of it ſelfe it is as unable, as a body paſt age is unapt to bring forth a childe. Conſider therefore, whether you have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuch a faith into your hearts, as makes you fruitfull of good workes. If we beleeve Gods promiſes faithfully, it will ſub-miniſter ſtrength to produce all ſorts of good workes, which otherwiſe the heart of it ſelfe would never produce. For he that beleeveth Gods promiſes ſhall obtaine ſtrength from God to obey his holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and according to the ſtrength of it, to abound in good workes of all ſorts. Faith is a ſtrong grace and puts a new power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule by which it ſhall be fit to doe good workes. We have more largely diſcourſed of the nature of faith in the Example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is alſo commended for faith.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Sarah</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Abraham</hi> her husband had two worthy vertues.<note place="margin">2. Shee obeyed her husband.</note> Firſt, ſhee obeyed <hi>Abraham</hi> her husband. Secondly, ſhee reverenced him, and that in her heart and tongue too, for ſhee called him Sir when ſhee thought of him in heart. Her obedience ſhewed it ſelfe in a cheerefull forwardneſſe to prepare things neceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine Angels that came unto her in the likeneſſe of men, for it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.6.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham haſted into the Tent to</hi> Sarah, <hi>and bad her quickly make ready three meaſures of fine flower and make cakes upon the hearth,</hi> which ſhee did accordingly without grumbling or deferring. Shee did not oppoſe her husband and demand, husband, you know not what theſe men be? nor whence they come? why ſhould you make ſuch care to prepare for them? but without any more adoe, at her
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:27208:83"/>
husbands commandement, ſhee gate all things ready according to his deſire. This is a commendable thing in a wife, and is to be followed by all you godly women, who would be counted daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Sarah;</hi> if your husbands wiſh you to doe things honeſt and lawfull, you muſt addreſſe your ſelves not to make your objections, but to yeeld your cheerefull obedience according to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> commandement, that ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.1.</note> 
               <hi>Wives bee ſubject to your husbands in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any ſay, that this was but a ſmall matter.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, true, but it is reported as it were a taſte of her good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in this matter, and a ſigne of her dutifull obedience, the glory whereof the Holy Ghoſt giveth her more generally, ſaying, that <hi>ſhee obeyed her husband,</hi> meaning,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.6.</note> conſtantly and generally ſhee ſubmitted her ſelfe and was obedient.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is noted of her, that ſhee reverenced her husband,<note place="margin">3. Shee reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</note> which is alſo commanded to wives by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let the wife ſee that ſhee feare her husband.</hi> Loe it is earneſtly charged upon wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they muſt looke to it that they yeeld it: Let the wife, that is, every wife, ſee, that is, carefully looke to it, and not make ſhifts or pretend excuſes, but ſee, that ſhee doe it, even feare her husband.</p>
            <p>There is a double feare,<note place="margin">A double feare</note> one which maketh one tremble and flie from the thing feared as hurtfull and miſchievous, ſo as men doe feare a Lyon or Beare, to runne from him as faſt as they can, that hee may not teare us in pieces, ſuch a feare as this is not required. Another feare is, feare of offending, wronging, or grieving the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon feared, flying and ſhunning all ſuch things as would diſpleaſe him and make him conceive with diſlike an irreſpectiveneſſe of him. This is the feare of the wife, not to dare to diſpleaſe her husband or anger him, not ſo much leaſt he ſhould flie upon her with reproofes and blowes, as leaſt ſhee ſhould be an inſtrument of griefe to one, whom ſhee loveth and honoureth by her undutifullneſſe and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And it muſt be noted that ſhee did ſo reverence him as to call him Lord. And how did ſhee call him Lord? not in ſpeaking to him, or in ſpeaking of him before others, by whom it might be told him againe what ſhee had ſaid, but when ſhee thought of him or ſpake of him with the inward ſpeech of her heart, which none could relate againe, but God who hath related this to her praiſe. For that title ſhee gave him even in her inward cogitations, when ſhe ſaid in her ſelfe at the hearing of the Angels promiſe, that ſhe ſhould have a ſon,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.12.</note> 
               <hi>Shall I have pleaſure after I have waxed old, my Lord being old alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the reverence of a good wife ſhould be hearty, and cauſe her when ſhee doth but thinke, of her husband, even then to give a title of due reſpect. Wherefore to give rude and undecent termes to an husband, ſuch as would but become a Miſtreſſe ſpeaking to her bondman, <hi>Ned, Iacke, Dick, Tom, Robbin,</hi> is even a little too much familiarity in a wife, favouring of ſome degree of contempt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:27208:84"/>The ground of theſe two duties, reverence and obedience, is the image of God in the husband: For he doth ſtand in Gods roome over her, becauſe <hi>as Chriſt is the Head of his Church, ſo is the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the wives head,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.3, 7</note> 
               <hi>and the woman is the glory of the man,</hi> meaning, one that is made to bring ſome glory and honour to him.</p>
            <p>Now by this fruit of <hi>Sarahs</hi> obedience which the Holy Ghoſt hath noted, it is prooved that <hi>Sarah</hi> was huſwifely in her houſe, even as a woman that could ſtirre about in her family, and looke to the diſpatching of neceſſary affaires by her ſervants and them in her family. For had ſhee beene a coy and nice or idle and ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dame, ſhee would neither have dreſſed meale, nor kneaded it, nor made cakes of it, nor ſeene to the baking of them, nor yet have followed her maid-ſervants, and looked that they ſhould have beene diligent in this buſineſſe.</p>

                  </gap> Shee was a loving Mother and nurſed <hi>Iſaac</hi> her ſelfe. Gen. 21.7.</note>Further in reſpect of her ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſhee was a very loving Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and nurſed him with her owne breaſts, and thought it a duty for her ſo to doe, for ſo it is noted of her that ſhee ſaid by way of thankefull wondering at the benefit, <hi>who would have ſaid to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>that</hi> Sarah <hi>ſhould have given children ſuck? for I have borne him a ſonne in his old age,</hi> as if ſhee confeſſed, that giving a childe ſucke ſhould not be ſeparated from bearing him. And indeed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth manifeſtly call upon women for this duty, for to what purpoſe hath God given them breſts? as it were bottles, at that time repleniſhed with ſuch a fit and well pleaſing foode for the babe, ſurely not to milke out on the ground, not to draw it backe by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines and devices, but to give it to the new inhabitant of the world, with whom it came into the world. So ſoone as a woman hath a childe in her wombe ready to bring forth, ſhee hath alſo milke in her breſts fit for its feeding, and is not this as much, as if the Lord ſhould ſpeake unto her and ſay, I would have you take care to bring up this childe which thou haſt brought forth, with this nouriſhment, which I have laid up in ſtore for it, for ſurely God and nature make nothing in vaine. This loving part of <hi>Sarah</hi> is more conſiderable in reſpect of her age and her greatneſſe of eſtate and houſehold, for ſhee was ninety yeares old, and might in that reſpect have ſeemed warranted to have given her ſelfe a diſpenſation from this ſervice, and to have ſaid, ſhould a woman of mine age endure the labour of watching and waking and looking to a childe, and induring all its froward fits and a number of attendance? why may I not ſet it to a younger woman ſtronger and better able to doe it then my ſelfe? Shee was wife to <hi>Abraham,</hi> a man of great place and ſtate, fellow to a King, with whom Kings ſought to be in covenant, and ſhould ſuch a woman as I? might ſhee have objected, ſubmit my ſelfe to this meane and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious office, may not I hire another to doe it for mee? mine hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, might, ſhee have ſaid; is a great man and withall hoſpitall.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, have I not a very great houſehold? muſt I leave the care of looking to them for ſuckling of a childe? which another ordinary bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may doe as well as my ſelfe, that will not perform the duty of over-ſeeing mine houſe. <hi>Sarah</hi> made no ſuch excuſes, but when ſhe had borne <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſonne ſhee would alſo give the childe ſucke. And truly, this duty is a very good duty, and grounded upon very good reaſon; For who doth not ſee? that it is a very great meanes of cauſing Mothers to grow in tenderneſſe of love to their children, and ſo of making children afterwards more dutifull to them.</p>

            <p>I know it is lawfull for women of rich eſtate and high place to weare jewels, ſilke, purple, ſcarlet, gold, ſilver, but women muſt be ſure not to be given to ſuch things, nor to be more coſtly then their husbands purſes and places will beare, nor to be ſumptuous this way, that if their coſtes about workes of mercy were laid in ballance againſt their coſt in attire, the former would proove in a manner nothing to the latter.</p>

                  <hi>Sarahs</hi> faults. 1. Shee was weake in faith</note>And now let us conſider the weakeneſſes of <hi>Sarah.</hi> Firſt, ſhee was weake in faith, for this cauſed her to give <hi>Hagar</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> her husband, and ſo to bring the ſinne of Poligamy into the Church of God wherewith it may ſeeme it was not polluted before. Shee doubted leaſt her ſelfe ſhould not be fruitfull, and therefore brought <hi>Hagar</hi> to him, to trie whether the promiſed ſeed might come of her, and yet once more ſhee bewrayed more unbeleefe, when the Angell of God told <hi>Abraham</hi> in her hearing, that he ſhould have a ſonne by her at the time of life, ſhee laughed at the promiſe of God as at a thing ridiculous and impoſſible,<note place="margin">Gen. 18 12.</note> ſaying, <hi>After I am old ſhall I have pleaſure?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and my Lord being old alſo,</hi> for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Shee was old and it ceaſed to be with her after the manner of women.</hi> See how when God promiſed a thing in nature and reaſon utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſhee ſo farre forgat the Omnipotent power of God, as to think ſure it could never come to paſſe, though God had promiſed it, and the Angell reprooved her,<note place="margin">Ver. 14.</note> ſaying. <hi>Shall any thing be impoſsible with God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the people of God doe ſometimes ſtagger at the promiſe of God through unbeleefe, when God ſaith one thing and reaſon ſaith the contrary, they conſult with fleſh and bloud, and credit their owne reaſon above the authority of God which ſpeaketh to them. This is a great fault, and tendeth much to the diſhonour of God, as if his power were limited by the rules of reaſon, or by the courſe of nature,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:27208:85"/>
and did not exceede our reaſon and ſtand quite above the power of nature. Wee muſt ſee this ſinne in our ſelves, labouring to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it but not diſcouraged, for this weakeneſſe of faith may well ſtand with the truth of faith, not he hath no faith at all who is many times troubled with doubting, but he which yeelds to it and is overcome by it.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt alſo ſtrive to waxe ſtrong in faith, by putting our ſelves in minde of Gods Omnipotency and faithfullneſſe, as <hi>Sarah</hi> did at length, for the Apoſtle witneſſeth,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.11.</note> that <hi>ſhee judged him faithfull which had promiſed,</hi> and thoſe promiſes which we muſt labour ſtedfaſtly to beleeve, are the promiſes of God to pardon our ſinnes, and write his Law in our hearts, and to make us able to walke in his waies, and crowne us at laſt with life and glory, nonwithſtanding our ſinnes and imperfections. Though the performance of theſe promiſes ſeeme to us as impoſſible as that a dry woman ſhould be a mother, yet we muſt labour to reſt upon them, becauſe of the fidelity of him that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to perfect his power in our weakeneſſe.</p>

                  </gap>ſed her husband. Gen. 16.5.</note> that once ſhee forgat her ſelfe to her husband, and was full of anger and diſcontent, wrongfully char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him to take her maides part againſt her, ſaying, <hi>My wrong he on thee for I have given my maide into thy boſome, and now I am deſpiſed in her ſight.</hi> It was true, that <hi>Hagar</hi> did ſleight her too much, but that <hi>Abraham</hi> was guilty of this fault by bearing out <hi>Hagar</hi> in it, that was altogether falſe, as his anſwer prooveth plainely, for hee ſaith, <hi>thy maide is in thine hand, doe with her what thou wilt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 6.</note> So <hi>Sarahs</hi> anger made her uſe falſe accuſations againſt her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>Be humbled yee wives, if you have chafed with your husbands and carried your ſelves injuriouſly towards them in words, <hi>Sarah</hi> did this, but ſhe did it not oft, it was this one time alone, ſo farre as we read, in other things ſhee behaved her ſelfe meekely and reverently. O looke to your ſelves, that you offend not continually in that thing wherein this good woman offended once alone, and no more, for this once was even too much, keepe downe anger therefore and let it not breake out againſt your husbands.</p>
            <p>And you husbands, learne though your wives doe tranſgreſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, not to be harſh with them againe, but heale their errours with the ſpirit of meekeneſſe as <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo did. Shee muſt blame her ſelfe, but ſhee may bee indued with grace for all this.</p>
            <p>But another weakeneſſe of <hi>Sarah</hi> is,<note place="margin">3. Shee was ſomewhat too rough with <hi>Hagar.</hi>
               </note> that ſhee was ſomewhat too rough with <hi>Hagar,</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Hagar</hi> could not indure it, for if ſhee was ſo violent in words with <hi>Abraham,</hi> what doe you thinke her carriage was to the maide, yea ſhee was ſomething too earneſt againſt <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and her too, when nothing would ſerve her, but that ſhe muſt have them both together caſt out of doores. For though God bad <hi>Abraham</hi> doe according to her words, it followeth not thence, that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:27208:86"/>
ſhe was not overpaſſionate in it. God for a miſterie would have it done, and yet <hi>Sarah</hi> might offend in doing it. So good people are apt to be overharſh to them that wrong them, and exerciſe too much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. She diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at her husbands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</note>Another fault of <hi>Sarahs</hi> was, that ſhee diſſembled at her husbands requeſt, and that two ſeverall times, ſaying ſhee was his ſiſter, and ſo ſaying it, that thoſe to whom ſhee ſpake, might thinke ſhee was none of his wife, for that was the intention both of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi> It is a weakeneſſe in wives ſometimes to be led by their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, to doe that that is evill, and to joyne with them in ſinne. Here <hi>Sarah</hi> hazarded her chaſtitie to content her husband, to ſatisfie his feares, ſhe was like to have brought her ſelfe and others into a fearefull ſinne.</p>
            <p>This fault muſt be reformed by good wives amongſt others, and they muſt reſolve not to ſinne againſt God for their husbands ſakes, fearing his diſpleaſure more then the danger of their husbands or their anger. Indeede in laying nay to ſuch motions of their husbands, they muſt uſe reverence, and do it in a calme and quiet manner, but refuſe they muſt, being warned by the example of <hi>Sarah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. She lyed.</note>
               <hi>Sarahs</hi> laſt fault was, that ſhee denied her laughter to the Angell, when ſhee had ſinned in laughing. To lye in a paſſion for feare of blame, denying that one hath done a thing which indeed one hath done, that ſo one may eſcape reprehenſion or correction, is a ſinne to which mans nature is very ſubject, ſpringing from the want of the feare of God, and from an exceſſive carnall love to ones ſelfe, and deſire of his owne temporall ſafety. This fault you may reade, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.15. Reade it not to doe the like, but to amend it and to be moved to repent of it, if you have committed it.</p>
            <p>Now then let us reflect upon our ſelves, and conſider of our owne carriage, both to condemne the like faults in our ſelves, and to beare with them in others without bitter cenſuring, and ſo we ſhall profit by the knowledge of their evill deedes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sarahs</hi> bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</note>Now let us conſider the benefits that <hi>Sarah</hi> enjoyed, Shee had all thoſe common benefits of health and ſtrength and the like, which God doth uſually beſtow upon all men, but beſides ſhe enjoyed excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent benefits.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Shee vvas a holy vvoeman.</note>The firſt, that God gave her faith and ſaving grace, pardoned and paſſed by her offences, and ſanctified her and hath ſaved her ſoule, notwithſtanding her faults. This is the mercy of mercies, that God pleaſeth to ſanctifie and pardon, and ſave a man, for if he be ſanctified he is pardoned and ſhall be ſaved, what profit hath any one of other things if he want this, and ſo be damned for ever, after a little content enjoyed here.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore labour to finde this goodneſſe of God to us, let us humbly pray him that made <hi>Sarah</hi> godly, to make us ſo too. If when we reade of this worke of his grace to others, we praiſe him for it, he will graunt it to us as well as to them. The Lord is able to make
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:27208:86"/>
any other man or woeman godly as well as <hi>Sarah.</hi> Shee had as bad a nature, and as unable to make her ſelfe good as wee have, for ſhe alſo was a daughter of <hi>Adam.</hi> Therefore if you find your ſelves yet not to be indued with faith and holineſſe, take notice of theſe wants, and goe to the throne of grace for grace, beſeeching the Lord to fulfill his covenant to you, in giving you his Spirit to make you his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and it ſhall be unto you according to your conſtant and humble ſupplications.</p>
            <p>And thoſe whom God hath beene pleaſed to deale ſo graciouſly with, let them heartily and conſtantly praiſe him, labouring to make all croſſes ſeeme nothing to them in compariſon of this benefit. Say, though I bee poore, deſpiſed, afflicted, yet God hath given mee ſome faith and ſome holineſſe, and begun to ſanctifie and will preſerve me in this eſtate to life eternall. What cauſe have I to be diſcouraged at croſſes; to make one truely godly, though they be not without their faults, is the worthieſt of all mercies. In Heaven the Saints rejoyce in God, and are not interrupted in his ſervice, by remembrance of former afflictions, we one earth ſhould labour ſo to be glad in hope of that eternall weight of glory, that neither feeling of preſent miſeries nor feare of future, ſhould much hinder us therein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Sarah</hi> had a godly husband,<note place="margin">2 Shee had a godly and rich husband that was well eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> and did partake with him of his riches, honours, credit and all the good things which hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. This is a great favour to a wife, if ſhe be married to a good and holy man, and a man alſo of convenient eſtate and good eſteeme, that ſhe may be comforted by his goodneſſe, ſhewing it ſelfe in good carriage towards him, and may taſte the ſweetneſſe of his good and of his credit. To have an yoake-fellow that can patiently beare with ones wants, that is diligent and truſty, and ſo provideth for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily that nothing is wanting to her ſelfe and family, that lives in ſo good repute as ſhe for his ſake is better reſpected; in a word, ſuch a one as is a comfort and credit to her, a ſaviour of his body as indeed the husband ſhould be, is a ſingular benefit. She hath a great bleſſing that hath ſuch a husband, and muſt not forget to be much and often thankfull, yea though in ſome things he may be faulty, to the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and hazarding, and bringing croſſes both upon himſelfe and her, as twice <hi>Abraham</hi> did though an excellent man. Take notice of his favour, and learne to be carefull in doing your duties, ſo much the rather, becauſe your husbands be vertuous.</p>
            <p>But next, ſhe had <hi>Iſaac</hi> at length,<note place="margin">3. Shee had a godly childe.</note> if God give a woman children and good children, godly and holy, partakers of the bleſſing of God in their ſoules, that is a benefit to the wife as well as to the husband, She ſhall have joy of ſuch a child as well as hee, both the parents of righteous children ſhall have joy of them. Let woemen as well as men acknowledge this mercy, wee ſee that thoſe which are croſſed in children are much troubled at it, ſhould not thoſe whom God doth free from that little croſſe, giving them the contrary mercy, learne to praiſe and rejoyce in him for it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:27208:87"/>
               <note place="margin">4. God deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vered her twice out of a miſery into which ſhe had caſt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note>But further, God did vouchſafe to deliver her twice out of that miſerie into which twice ſhe had caſt her ſelfe, by her owne fault. If any one by their owne unbeleefe, carnall feares, or other evill beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, have thruſt themſelves into the brambles, and God by his ſpeciall providence and care hath granted them an happy iſſue and eſcape, they muſt even admire and applaud Gods goodneſſe, that hath ſo undeſervedly pittied them, and paſſing by their faults hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelfe fatherly to them. <hi>Sarah</hi> by ſaying I am <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſiſter, procured, that ſhe was taken by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to be his wife, God hindered <hi>Pharaoh</hi> from comming neere her, and after by a dreame warned him of the matter, and ſo hee diſmiſſed <hi>Sarah</hi> untouched. After ſhe offended in like manner againe, and againe the Lord in like manner delivered her: what a graciouſneſſe of God was this? She knew not in the world what to doe, ſhe had intangled her ſelfe in a ſnare and could not get out, now God hee ſets in, hee brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſnare and ſets her at liberty. Without doubt <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> both were exceeding glad of this eſcape, and praiſed God for it.</p>
            <p>If by the meere providence of God without any fault of our hand, miſeries breake in upon us, and then we crie to God and be reſcued, we have cauſe to acknowledge it as a great favour. How much more then when he drawes us out of the evills into the which we have ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully thruſt our owne ſelves, ſending ſome ſuch meanes of helpe as we could never conceive of, or procure to our ſelves. Call to mind ſuch deliverances, to praiſe God with great fervency and humility for them, and learne both to truſt upon his goodneſſe after the more ſtedfaſtly, eſpecially, if more then once wee have thus inſnared our ſelves, and more then once the Lord hath pittied us and helped us, we muſt never ceaſe wondering at his goodneſſe, reſolving alſo to take heed of ever provoking him by like folly, for he that can open the doore of danger, when we our ſelves by ſeeking ſinnefully to eſcape ſome other evill, have locked it upon our ſelves, can ſurely, yea and will keepe us if we doe caſt our ſelves upon him, and refuſe to take up ſinnefull and unlawfull ſhifts. Could not the Lord have found a good and holy way of ſaving <hi>Abrahams</hi> life and <hi>Sarahs</hi> chaſtitie? of reſtraining the cruelty of theſe men as well as their wantonneſſe: If God can helpe out of reall and preſent danger beyond our hopes, he can ſurely keepe us out of feared and imaginary dangers aboue our thoughts.</p>
            <p>And if any of Gods people have wound themſelves into croſſes, they muſt not be diſmayed from ſeeking to God for helpe, by aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating their croſſes with this thought, O fooliſh and ſinnefull man, I have pulled it upon my ſelfe by my folly, how can I expect helpe from him? but moſt humbly acknowledge their owne folly and yet take boldnes to ſue to him for mercy, both to pardon and to helpe them.</p>
            <p>Theſe be the ſpeciall benefits given to <hi>Sarah.</hi> Now her croſſes muſt be conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:27208:87"/>Firſt, She was barren a long time, this was a croſſe to her no doubt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sarahs</hi> croſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. She was bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren a long time.</note> becauſe of her earneſt deſire to have childeren, and becauſe as I ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the hope of her ſalvation did hang upon the fruit of her wombe. Barrenneſſe is ſuch a croſſe you ſee as hath befallen a godly woeman. Let them therefore that are exerciſed with it, learne to beare it with patience, and labour to get hearts ſo much more fruitfull of good workes, that ſuch ſpirituall fruitfulneſſe may make amends for the want of the fruit of their bodies. If God make not a woeman to beare children, but make her pious and godly, able to bring forth the fruits of the ſpirit in that ſpirituall marriage betwixt Chriſt and her, ſhe hath cauſe to be ſo thankefull for this fruitfulneſſe, as eaſily to brooke the trouble of the other unfruitfulneſſe. And thoſe whom God doth not afflict with this affliction, muſt learne to praiſe him for their fertile wombe. It is a ſinne not to prize even theſe temporall benefits, but to grumble at abundance of fruit of the body, is ſo foule a fault of ingratitude and unbeleefe, that a man or woeman ſhould greatly blame themſelves for turning a thing beneficiall in it ſelfe into a diſtreſſe and miſery unto themſelves.</p>
            <p>Another croſſe was, that ſhe was ſleighted by her maide,<note place="margin">2. Shee was ſleighted by her maide.</note> yea that ſhe bare the croſſe ſomewhat impatiently, muſt be reckoned in the number of her ſinnes. Doubtleſſe it is a trying affliction to be aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with rude ſaucy and contemptuous words and geſtures of a diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient and undutifull ſervant. Hardly ſhall the ſpirit of a gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be able to hold it ſelfe in patience, when it ſhall ſee a ſervant or inferiour to looke too diſdainefully or arrogantly, or heare them utter ſurly and ſcoffing words. Pride in an inferiour ſhewes it ſelfe by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifulneſſe, and it will prove an hard thing to the ſuperiour not to thinke it equall that pride ſhould encounter pride againe with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate reſiſtance of it. You muſt learne that have ſervants moſt times (as moſt times <hi>Hagar</hi> was) dutifull, to be thankefull for it, and muſt take heede of doing any thing, by which you may give your ſervants occaſion to ſleight and contemne you, for their corruption will quickly lay hold upon any occaſion of ſuch miſdemeanour.</p>
            <p>A third croſſe was this,<note place="margin">3. She was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her husband into the houſe of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Abimelech.</hi>
               </note> to be taken from her husband into the houſe of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and after of <hi>Abimelech.</hi> 'Tis true ſhe could blame none but her ſelfe and her husband for that croſſe, but that did not make it leſſe a croſſe, as hee is no leſſe wounded that woundes himſelfe by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, then he whom an enemy ſhould purpoſely wound, and this croſſe was made a little the more bitter by this, that ſhe was though gently and with milde wordes, yet duely chidden for it by <hi>Abimelech</hi> too, who tels her plainely of it ſaying, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.16. <hi>I have given thy brother,</hi> (this name hee gives <hi>Abraham</hi> ironically, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a tart rebuke, as much as if he had ſaid, whom thou wouldeſt have had us thinke to be onely thy brother) <hi>a</hi> 100. <hi>ſhekels,</hi> that is, of our money, ſome 72. lb. od money, neere upon a 100. markes, and addes, <hi>behold hee is to thee a covering of thine eyes, and to all that are with thee, and with all other: thus ſhee was reprooved.</hi> She was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

of the rebuke, this was ſomewhat bitter, that a ſtranger ſhould chide her for not ſufficiently covering her eyes.

               </note>It will not be amiſſe to add <hi>Hagar</hi> to her, of whoſe birth we have nothing recorded in Scripture, and as little of her death, but by that which the Scripture ſpeaketh of her, there is ſome good probability that ſhe was a woeman fearing God, Firſt becauſe of all woemen in <hi>Sarahs</hi> houſe (who having above 300. men-ſervants, muſt needes have many maide-ſervants alſo) ſhe made choice of her to give unto her husband <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the end that ſome ſeede, yea the promiſed ſeede might be taken from her. Sure <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> would not have preferred her above all the maidens in the houſe, if they had not thought her alſo a good and godly maiden. I ſuppoſe therefore that ſeeing her matter and miſtreſſe thought her good, we ſhould goe againſt the rules of charity, though we reade of ſome faults ſhe had, if we thinke not ſo too.<note place="margin">Her life.</note> Let us conſider of her life and ſee her vertues and faults,<note place="margin">1. Her Vertues.</note> benefits and croſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Shee was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to her governours.</note>Firſt, it was a great vertue in her, that all the time of her dwelling with <hi>Abraham</hi> before, ſhee carried her ſelfe very dutifully and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively to <hi>Sarah,</hi> elſe ſhe would never have given her into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. Let all ſervants learne of her to ſhew all reverence and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull behaviour to their governours, and not onely to the rich and wealthy, but to the poore alſo, nay as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, not onely to the good and curteous, but alſo to the froward, for ſo is Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to them expreſſely, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and if any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant doe otherwiſe, they do not garniſh and adorne, but diſgrace and diſcredit true religion. The ſervant is no further godly then hee or ſhe ſhewes reverence and honour to the maſter and governeſſe. Looke therefore that you ſet your ſelves to pleaſe and content your gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours with all obedience and duty, if you will have God and your owne conſciences to approve of you.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Shee told the truth.</note>Secondly, when the Angell met her and asked her whence ſhe came, and whither ſhe went, ſhe anſwered plainely, and ſaid, <hi>I flie from the face of my Miſtreſſe</hi> Sarah,<note place="margin">Gen. 16.8.</note> ſhe told truth without lying, and that is a good thing and commendable to ſpeake truth though it be to ones owne ſhame, but to have told a lie to an Angell might have procured her great reproofe,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:27208:88"/>
and herein you may ſee that <hi>Hagar</hi> exceeded her Miſtreſſe, for when the Angell charged <hi>Sarah</hi> with laughing, ſhee denied it, but <hi>Hagar</hi> being examined confeſſeth the truth without lying. We ſhall doe better in this caſe to follow the maide then the Miſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>Another good thing in her was that when ſhee was commanded by the Angell of God to goe and humble her ſelfe to her Miſtreſſe,<note place="margin">3. Shee ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted her ſelfe to her Miſtreſſe a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Angels commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ſhee did ſo. Here all you inferiours muſt learne of her, nay rather of the Angell which taught her what you ſhould doe, if you have by frowardneſſe or ill carriage provoked your Governours, ſo that they doe uſe perhaps a little too much rigour towards you, yet you muſt ſubmit and humble your ſelves, acknowledge your owne faultineſſe, and patiently ſtoope to their words of reproofe, yea or blowes of correction. This ſubmiſſion is the beſt way to pacifie wrath, and to ſettle peace. Afterwards, we reade of no falling our betwixt <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi> Learne therefore all yee ſervants to ſtoope and bee ſubmiſſive, that will ſhew humility and winne favour with God and man.</p>
            <p>Further,<note place="margin">4. Shee was thankfull to God for his goodneſſe in bringing her home to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> family.</note> it was well done of <hi>Hagar</hi> and is ſome good proofe of her piety, that ſhee conſidered of this viſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.13. and called the name of God, <hi>thou God ſeeſt mee,</hi> confeſſing that now ſhee took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Gods ſeeing and obſerving her waies, and that ſhee ſaid moreover, <hi>have I alſo here looked after him that ſeeth mee?</hi> as if ſhee ſhould ſay. Doe I live after the Lord hath come thus to take notice of mee, and to reproove mee and ſend mee home againe, and ſo the name was called it may be by <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom when ſhee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhe related this viſion, <hi>the well of him that lived,</hi> and <hi>him that ſaw,</hi> becauſe the Angell looked upon her and ſhee lived, or becauſe the living God pleaſed to ſee her and looke upon her. Shee was thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God for his goodneſſe in looking mercifully upon her and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her home againe to <hi>Abrahams</hi> family. We muſt be thankfull if the Lord daigne us that favour to meete us in our wandrings, and turne us backe againe from them.</p>
            <p>Further,<note place="margin">5. Shee was pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tient.</note> it was a good thing in <hi>Hagar</hi> that ſhee yeelded her ſelfe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to goe away without murmuring and diſtemper, when hee ſent her away and her ſonne in ſuch poore faſhion, patient bearing of ſuch hard and ſevere uſage was no little proofe of goodneſſe. And when her ſonne was like to die for thirſt, ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe patient, for ſhee went a good way off, becauſe ſhe would not ſee him die, and there ſhee ſate and wept, ſhee might have done better to have prayed with her weeping, but to ſit and mourne, not to hang her noſe over him weeping and roaring was ſome ſigne of patient diſcretion, ſhewing her love to him.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, ſhee tooke care of him afterwards,<note place="margin">6. Shee was carefull to provide her ſonne a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient wife.</note> to provide him a convenient wife, for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.21. this is a duty of Parents to make fit proviſion for the timely beſtowing of their children in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, whereof to be negligent is a part of one that regardeth not to keepe his childe in good order, and to make too much haſte is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:27208:89"/>
to make them haſten to miſery. So <hi>Hagar</hi> was a good ſervant and a good wiſe Mother, and a good woman, her carriage except in a few things was good.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sarahs</hi> faults 1. Shee grew proud.</note>See her faults now. Firſt, ſhee grew proud, becauſe ſhee was with childe by <hi>Abraham</hi> and deſpiſed her Miſtreſſe. The Maidens of <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel</hi> may ſhame <hi>Hagar</hi> in this, for neither of them is accuſed for any ſuch miſdemeanour. Take heede yee ſervants, that you grow not inſolent and contemptuous againſt your gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, you ſee how much it diſtempered <hi>Sarah,</hi> and it is a grievous ſinne to put your rulers into paſſion by your ill carriage. When the Angell met <hi>Hagar</hi> he commands her to goe and humble her ſelfe to her Miſtreſſe. It is apparant therefore her carriage to her was amiſſe. There be ſome ſervants that having beene over-familiar with the Maſter, take occaſion ſoone to ſleight their Miſtreſſe. So they add ſinne to ſinne and are found double offenders; If any of you have offended in contempt, much more in ſo ill grounded a contempt, do that which the Angell bad <hi>Hagar,</hi> humble your ſelves before God, if not to your Miſtreſſes. Follow what was good in <hi>Hagar</hi> not what was bad.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Shee ranne away from her Miſtreſſe.</note>Another fault of hers was, that ſhe ran away from her Miſtreſſe, which the Angell alſo ſhewes to have beene ſinfull by ſending her backe againe. Let not the Divell make any of you play the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by running away from your governours if they be ſomewhat ſharpe to you, rather ſtrive to pacifie them by ſubmiſſion, then to caſt off the yoke by betaking your ſelves to your heeles. Theſe be her onely faults, for I am loath to charge her with having an hand in <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> mocking of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> for <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was then upon the point of ſixteene yeares old, for <hi>Abraham</hi> was eighty ſixe when <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was borne, and 100 when <hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſucked ſome while, like enough above a yeare, and ſo <hi>Iſhmael</hi> muſt be neere about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, that ſhee may thinke he was ſo ſenſible of being <hi>Abrahams</hi> heire as to laugh at the ſtirre made about the young childe, as if by his comming into the world he ſhould be diſ-inherited.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Her benefits. 1. She was one of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervants.</note>Now ſee her croſſes and comforts; Firſt, ſhee was ſo happy as to be a ſervant in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe and ſo a member of the true Church within the Covenant of grace, by vertue of her being a member of that domeſticall Church. It is a very good benefit, when the Lord vouchſafeth to place a ſervant in a good family under good and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Governours, which will affoord them all good uſage for their bodies, and all needfull helpes alſo for the ſalvation of their ſoules. They may enjoy as much comfort in this as in any one thing that can befall them in reſpect of their habitation and dwelling, to have good Governours in a good houſe. For in being under the roofe and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a godly man, they be under the cuſtody of God himſelfe, and guard of holy Angels.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, let all thoſe that have children and muſt diſpoſe of them to be ſervants, be principally carefull of this matter. Let your care be to provide for yours Maſters, not alone of good eſtate with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:27208:89"/>
whom they may live comfortably for their bodies, having good at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, good fare, good diet and the like, but by whoſe meanes the may be helped to knowledge, faith, obedience, graces of all ſorts and to life eternall hereafter. Seeing your children be made after Gods image, have a ſoule as well as a body, and have neede as much of things profitable for the ſoule, ſince that is the farre better part, and if that be well, the good eſtate thereof will eaſily countervaile and make amends for the evills which the body ſuffered, but if it be in bad eſtate, all the bodily benefits will nothing at all advantage it: therefore I require you in the firſt place to reſpect this moſt neceſſary thing in placing out your children.</p>
            <p>And all you ſervants that have beene directed either by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or by the carefull indeavours of your good friends unto ſuch houſeholds wherein you have all good uſage for your outward man, and over and above the comfortable helpes of domeſticall duties to bring you unto goodneſſe, take notice of this mercy and thanke God for it, and take heede that you grow not weary of thoſe holy duties, and ſhew not your ſelves ſo prophane, as to be troubled at that which ſhould be your greateſt content. Yea I pray you ſo many as live in good families, ſtrive ſo to conforme your ſelves to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the houſehold, as that you may have goodneſſe by the meanes of goodneſſe there uſed, for otherwiſe that which ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured life to you ſhall ſerve to make your deſtruction more terrible. Learne to pray, learne to heare Gods Word, learne to be good by the precepts and examples of your Governours, elſe as our Saviour tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, that <hi>it ſhall be eaſier with the Sodomites,</hi> then the <hi>Capernaites</hi> at the day of judgement, ſo ſhall it be for the ſervants of profaneſt Maſters then for you that ſerve good and holy Maſters and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Hagar</hi> had the favour of her Miſtreſſe very much,<note place="margin">2. Shee had the favour of her Maſter and Miſtreſſe.</note> elſe you may aſſure your ſelves that ſhee would never have made her a Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine to her husband, neither would <hi>Abraham</hi> have taken her to be Concubine wife if hee had not thought ſome good of her. This therefore was a benefit to her, that ſhe was well reputed of both by <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> both the Governours of the family were well affected unto <hi>Hagar,</hi> and this is a great comfort unto a ſervant, that their Rulers entertaine them with good liking, approoving well of them and of their ſervices, for by that meanes they be made capable of enjoying much comfort in their lives, and of receiving ſuch curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and rewards from their Governours as they be capable of, and of eſcaping much hard uſage which elſe they ſhould likely feele.</p>
            <p>This ſhould teach all ſervants to doe their uttermoſt indeavour that they may, to winne the love of their Governours by ſubmiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and obedience, performing the commandement of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle who commandeth to doe ſervice with good will,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.3. Tit. 2.9.</note> and to pleaſe them well in all things and to ſerve with feare, and to doe the will of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:27208:90"/>
God from the heart, remembring that they ſerve the Lord Chriſt, and if God will as he hath promiſed give them reward of inheritance, he will much more cauſe the hearts of their Governours to favour and accept them. Thus <hi>Ioſeph</hi> gat his Maſters good will and was great in his houſe, this is the right way to procure favour, take this courſe and God ſhall be with you, but put away farre from you all croſſing and thwarting, and idleneſſe, and eye-ſervice, and anſwering againe, and the like evill carriages, which will alienate your Rulers hearts from you and make you ſeeme hatefull to them, and if any of you doe not finde your Governours good liking, take heed that your own naughty behaviour have not beene the cauſe of it. And if you have it, take heed of abuſing it to wrong both them and your ſelves; and all you Governours, learne to ſhew favour to your ſervants, unleſſe their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe hinder it.<note place="margin">Pro. 14 35. &amp; 27.18.</note> 
               <hi>For the favour of a King ſhall be to a good ſervant,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>hee that waiteth on his Maſter ſhall be promoted to honour, as he that tendeth a figtree ſhall eate of the fruit of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. She received great mercies from God.</note>Furthermore, <hi>Hagar</hi> received great mercies from God, for he gave her to conceive by <hi>Abraham,</hi> and when ſhe ran away, met with her and directed her to goe backe againe, which ſhee acknowledged with great thankes, for he gave her alſo a heart to goe backe and ſubmit to her Miſtreſſe. This is a great favour of God, if he finde us in our out-ſtrayings, and give us both direction and will to come into the right way againe. Pray to God, that he would thus guide you and not ſuffer you to continue and periſh in your out-ſtrayings.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. Shee had <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and a promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him.</note>Another mercy of God to <hi>Hagar</hi> was, that ſhee had <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and a promiſe, that God would be with him and bleſſe him, and make him a great man, and that he made <hi>Iſhmael</hi> after dutifull to her, for he was guided by her in taking a wife which ſhe had choſen for him. If children have not grace, yet if they proſper in the world and yeeld themſelves dutifully to their Parents to be guided by them, they muſt acknowledge it as a great favour from Heaven.</p>
            <p>Againe, it was a ſpeciall goodneſſe of God to her, that when ſhee wandred in the wilderneſſe, and the water was ſpent, and her ſonne was ready to die for thirſt, God pitied both him and her, and ſhewed her a Well whereby ſhee gat water to give him, and promiſed to bleſſe him, and ſo he revived, and lived, and proſpered. All theſe favours <hi>Hagar</hi> had.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Her croſſes.</note>Conſider what croſſes ſhe felt, for ſome bitter things ſhe met withall as well as theſe comfortable and pleaſing things.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sarah</hi> uſed her hardly.</note> Firſt, the hard uſage of <hi>Sarah</hi> was tedious to her, and ſo much the more tedious by how much ſhe was more guilty of pulling it on her ſelfe by her diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſtubborneneſſe, rude and contemptuous carriage. All you that be ſervants, if you finde your Governours ſharp and rigorous, conſider with your ſelves, whether your irreverent and diſobedient behaviour have nor provoked them againſt you, and expoſed you to this affliction, and if ſo, humble your ſelves before God firſt, and after to them. But if any have eſcaped this croſſe, let them bleſſe the name of God that hath kept them from ſtubborne and undutifull courſes, and given
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:27208:90"/>
their governours wiſedome and meekeneſſe not to be ſharpe as ſome governours be without juſt cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now another croſſe to <hi>Hagar</hi> was this,<note place="margin">2. Shee and her ſon were caſt out of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> family.</note> that ſhe and her ſonne were both ſent out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, in ſuch a poore and ill provided manner as the ſtory telleth us. This is a miſery very heavy to beare, to be caſt out of ones countrey and place of habitation, where they lived comfortably, and forced to want all thoſe benefits being deprived of them all at once. Wherefore take heed leaſt by abuſing theſe kinde of benefits, you provoke not the Lord to caſt you out of the Church, or out of your houſes and dwellings, but make you a good uſe of ſuch mercies that they may be continued to you, and learne, if ſuch a croſſe ſhould befall you, yet not to be diſheartned and diſcouraged, but to humble your ſelves before God knowing that in ſuch extremity the Lord is ready to helpe and ſuccour you.</p>
            <p>The laſt croſſe of <hi>Hagars</hi> was,<note place="margin">3. Shee ſaw her ſonne ready to die with thirſt.</note> that ſhe ſaw her ſonne <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſpent with thirſt and ready to die, and ſhe was utterly deſtitute of all meanes to helpe him, not being able farther to eaſe him or her ſelfe but by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of ſight and hearing, and ſitting downe to weepe and mourne. This is a lamentable heart-breaking to a Parent, if they be deſtitute of things needfull for this life, whether by occaſion of travell &amp; wandring out of the way, or of penury and neceſſity at home. How moſt heavie a heart hath a Father or Mother, if they ſee their children ready to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed through hunger, and have no bread to breake unto them, or are almoſt choaked through thirſt, and have no drink to beſtow upon them, neither know what to doe for them, but to conveigh themſelves out of ſight, and ſitting downe to empty their griefes in teares. This is a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that God ſent upon the Parents of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> by reaſon of famine and ſcarcity their children ſowned in the ſtreetes, and no man could ſupply them with bread. <hi>Lament.</hi> 4.4.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt learne to bleſſe the name of God moſt heartily, that hath freed us from this miſery, and hath not cauſed us to behold ſuch a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſight by one occaſion or other, but hath given us abundance of things neceſſary, yea if he have not furniſhed us with great ſtore, yet we have ſufficient to keep our ſelves and ours from pining away with want. O that we could be as full of thanks, when we are freed from wants, as we have beene of complaints even for ſmall croſſes. And now uſe moderately your abundance, that God may not ſtrip you of all and bring you to ſuch extremity, and why ſhould we forfeit our ſelves and ours to famiſhing? when wee ſee that God is tender to us, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſatisfie us with good things.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, let every man prepare for this croſſe, think of it, tell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, it may befall him, and reſolve if the wiſedome of God ſhall bring it upon him, that he will labour patiently to undergoe it, not ſo as to be ſorrowleſſe, that were no way commendable, but ſo as to be moderate in grieving, and to turne his griefe into ſpirituall griefe, and powre it forth before the Lord in humble and penitent confeſſions and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for ſinne.</p>

The Papiſts will needs challenge ſalvation as due by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of their owne workes, and ſo in very deed doe exclude themſelves from it by challenging it on a wrong ground. And the multitude are in this reſpect no whit better then the Papiſts; for their owne good deeds are ſtill in their mouthes, as if they would be ſaved by workes, which yet cannot ſave them, yea ſome reliques of this ignorant and fooliſh pride was found in the Saints, who if they finde not (which they will never finde) perfection in themſelves, are ſtill apt to queſtion their eſtate, as if it were their owne goodneſſe that ſhould bring them to Heaven, not the goodneſſe of God in Chriſt, rewarding them freely with that unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved crowne, becauſe they are become the children of God by faith in Chriſt. Now let us take heed of being the ſonnes of <hi>Hagar,</hi> but let us acknowledge ſtill our owne ſinfullneſſe and unworthineſſe, yet ſtill reſt on his mercy in Chriſt, and ſtrive to obey him in love, as children doe their Father, and ſo much for <hi>Hagar.</hi> (<g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>)</p>

               <note place="margin">Keturah.</note> The Scripture bringeth her in as it were a dumbe perſon, tells nothing of her parents, life, nor death, but mentioning her bare name alone, ſhewes that ſhee was <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife as I conceive, and what chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhee had by <hi>Abraham</hi> we are told, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.1. her ſonnes were ſixe, as you may reade in that place.

               <note place="margin">Iſhmael.</note> 
               <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was ſonne of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> his maide ſervant, borne unto him at his 86. yeeres, as ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> He was the ſonne of a godly Father, but whether himſelfe were godly or not it is uncertaine. But in his life we muſt note, Firſt, his Vertues. Secondly, his Faults. Thirdly, his Benefits. Fourthly, his Croſſes, and then ſhall we come to his death.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His Vertues. 1 He was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to his father.</note>His vertues. Firſt he lived in his fathers houſe in outward confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and obedience, for he ſubmitted to his father at 13. yeares to be circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.25. and ſo had the outward ſeale of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but yet he was not the promiſed ſeede, nor had the covenant made with him, nor had the Church and true religion continuing in his family. So we muſt learne not to ſatisfie our ſelves with being in the Church outwardly, but muſt labour to become true members of it, and to enter into the covenant indeed. It will not profit us to have the Sacraments outwardly adminiſtered to us, (for he is not a Jew which is one without, neither is that circumciſion which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the fleſh) but wee muſt indeavour after the inward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, even to get the righteouſneſſe which is by faith, that that faith may purifie our hearts, and purge away from us all filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit. And if we make uſe of the outward ſeale, thereby to be made to ſee and feele our uncircumciſedneſſe of heart, and heartily acknowledge Gods will and power to make us partakers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumciſion, ſo putting forth our ſelves to beg for, and labour after that inward circumciſion, the Lord will ſurely beſtow it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
            <p>Againe, all children muſt learne to ſubmit themſelves to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, at leaſt to an outward performance of ſuch holy duties, as by their parents they ſhall be inſtructed in, elſe they are worſe then <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> and will become matter of anguiſh and vexation to their godly parents. Would <hi>Iſhmael</hi> accept circumciſon, and wilt not thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept inſtruction, learne the principles of Chriſtian religion, and ſettle thy ſelfe to ſome ſhew of goodneſſe, then ſhall <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> example riſe up in judgement againſt thee and condemne thee. And parents muſt obſerve Gods goodneſſe in their childeren, if they find them even in ſuch a degree tractable and ruly, for this is farre better then to be wilde and furious, and to caſt of all ſemblance of goodneſſe, and yet ſuch would the beſt mans childeren prove, if the hand of God did not reſtraine them.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. He ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe to his father to be baniſhed out of his houſe.</p>
               </note>But another good thing in <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was, that he ſubmitted himſelfe to his Father to be baniſhed out of his houſe, no queſtion but <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> that loved him, would informe him of the neceſſity which lay upon himſelfe ſo to expell his ſonne, and would furniſh him with all good counſell, who then being ſome 16. yeares old was capable of good advice, and ſo did he without murmuring or wilfull refuſing to go yeeld himſelfe to that puniſhment. It is a good thing in childeren to take quietly their parents chaſtiſement, even though they ſhould be ſomewhat ſevere. But to oppoſe them, or to rebell againſt them,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:27208:93"/>
or fall to clamorouſneſſe and impatiency is a great ſinne, even though the correction ſhould be cauſeleſſe and unjuſt, how much more if they be righteous and deſerved. Learne of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> this ſubmiſſion, how will you hope that you be Gods childeren, if you do not equall ſuch a one as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in goodneſſe?</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">
                  <p n="3">3 Hee ioyned with <hi>Iſaac</hi> in his Fathers fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
               </note> 
               <hi>Iſhmael</hi> did another good office in the concluſion of his Fathers life, for it is noted of him, that he came to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and joyned with him in his Fathers funerall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.9. by which it is manifeſt, that he bare no grudge againſt his Father for caſting him out of his houſe, but bore that reſpect towards him which was due to a Father, and therefore did him the beſt honour he could at his latter end, yea that hee did not harbour in his minde any envious and malicious thought againſt <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and therefore would come unto him and unite his paines to burie his Father. Learne ſo much good of him I pray you, as to forget that ſeverity which perhaps Parents may have ſhewed to any of you, and not put off the dutifulneſſe of childeren, becauſe you have met with ſomething that fleſh and bloud would call hard meaſure. The leſſe inducement any man hath from a parents kindneſſe to love and honour him, the more commendable it is if hee performe all honour to him: but he that will be ſo tranſported with diſcontentment againſt a parent for ſome ſharpeneſſe, as even to hate and contemne him, moſt of all if his owne folly have inforced his parent to ſuch proceedings, is without all doubt a graceleſſe and a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched childe.</p>
            <p>I pray you learne alſo by <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> not to ſuffer envy to riſe againſt your Bretheren if in any thing they be preferred before you to your detriment. Love not them leſſe then the name of a Brother or Siſter doth require, becauſe you may thinke that they have ſtood betwixt your parents love and bounty and your ſelves, and ſo as it were overſhadowed you, and kept the ſun-ſhine from you, but behold the hand of God in ſo diſpoſing of things and reſolve to love ſtill as Bretheren.</p>
            <p>Further <hi>Iſhmael</hi> did one good act of honour and duty toward his mother <hi>Hagar.</hi> For it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.21.<note place="margin">
                  <p n="4">4. He was ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               </note> that his mother tooke him a wife out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo he was ruled by his mother in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, having her liking and conſent, yea giving himſelfe to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by her, as did alſo <hi>Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> to <hi>Iſaac.</hi> It is a needefull thing for childeren to take the conſent and aſſent of their parents, (yea if it be but of the mother, ſuppoſing the father to be dead or abſent,) and not to ruſh into this eſtate againſt their willes and privity. No comfort can come to the conſcience in ſuch a match, for whoſoever is joyned together otherwiſe then Gods Word alloweth, can have no ground of comfort, as thoſe are that are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without the good will of thoſe whom God hoth made his depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in this buſineſſe. The Lord ſaith to Parents, <hi>take wives for your ſonnes, and give your daughters,</hi> plainely putting them into his roome in that behalfe, wherefore having not conſent from them, they live
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:27208:94"/>
in an unlawfull matrimony, untill ſuch time as by humble repentance before God and ſubmiſſive intreaties to their parents, they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that good leave of their parents, which they ought to have gotten before. If therefore any amongſt you have ſo offended, they muſt ſee the fault, and be humbled and ſeeke pardon. Moſt times the Lord doth ſenſibly croſſe ſuch matches, make uſe of thoſe croſſes to increaſe your godly ſorrow for ſinne. And let thoſe children that are yet unmarried, take heed of intangling their affections without the privity of Parents, or of ſeeking to draw the affections of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, untill ſuch conſent have gone before, for feare they make this duty very difficult unto them, or thruſt themſelves out of the way of duty and obedience, by their headſtrong paſſions. So much of <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> good deeds, now of his bad.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His faults. 1. He mocked his brother.</note>Firſt, at ſome 15. or 16. yeares he mocked <hi>Iſaac,</hi> this mocking was a degree of perſecution and a fault in him. I cannot conceive that he did it out of any diſlike of <hi>Iſaacs</hi> piety, who being but a new weaned childe could not diſcover any piety unto him, at leaſt any ſuch act of piety as ſhould ſtirre up diſdaine and deriſion, but ſeeing ſuch a great gladneſſe and a merry feaſt at the weaning of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he made a ſport of him, as it were diſdaining that <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould ſeeme to thruſt him out of the inheritance. Now it is a great ſinne to mocke any one out of envy and ſcorne that they ſhould be preferred before them. Mocking ſhewes a great deale of pride in him that uſeth it, nothing but overvaluing of our ſelves makes us undervalew others. Mocking is a tedious thing to ſuffer, the good eſteeme wee have of our ſelves and thoſe that are neere unto us, makes the contrary carriage of others unſufferable, therefore is mocking a great offence. Take heed I pray you of uſing it toward your bretheren or neighbours; It is an act that tendeth ſtrongly to provoke, and we muſt not provoke one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: It is then moſt loathſome when it comes from envy and malice, make not a may game at your bretheren, floute them not, breake not jeſts upon them;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.4.</note> this jeſting is that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids, eſpecially laugh not at their miſeries and at their ſinnes, but moſt of all mocke not at them for well doing. Mocking is any carriage by which a man expreſſeth his contempt of another, and ſeekes to make him alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and deſpicable unto others. He that can ſet light by a man for goodneſſe ſake which ſhould procure honour, how blind a minde, how perverſe a judgement hath he. Be penitent if your folly have carried you to ſuch a ſinne, and now bridle your ſelves from ſuch ill carriage, hath not God ſhewed his diſlike of it ſufficiently, by puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing it in <hi>Iſhmael</hi> with baniſhment out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <p n="2">2 Was a wilde man.</p>
               </note>Another fault of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> is that which was foretold of him, that he was a wilde man, a kind of Aſſe-colt, that would not be ſubject to any almoſt, nor ruled by any. This is a grievous fault indeed, when he that hath the face, ſhape and faculties of a man, and ſhould have wiſedome to ſubmit himſelfe to ſuch as have authority over him, will yet know no governour, ſubmit to no authority, be kept within
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:27208:94"/>
no boundes, but leape over hedge and ditch as it were, and runne about after his owne fancy, and live as he liſts himſelfe, that is to ſay, will evertake upon him the qualities of a wild Aſſe-colt to man-ward, will never carry himſelfe as a ſheepe dutifully to God-ward. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of being ſuch wild fellowes that now follow their owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and care not what trickes they play, not heeding any admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition or any reaſon. If any of you have ſhewed your ſelves ſuch formerly, bewaile it before God, pray him to pardon you, pray him to turne you by ſhewing you your ſinnes, and miſerable eſtate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and pray him to make you at length to learne to take the yoake of obedience, and caſt of all wilde courſes, live like men not like wilde Aſſes. The wilde Aſſe runnes up and downe in the wilderneſſe, and will not be led nor driven, but will be where her fancy carryes her. Be not you ſuch, but let the directions and admonitions of your parents and governours, like bounds keepe you within compaſſe. He that will live wildly ſhall ſurely procure a world of miſeries to himſelfe at laſt: hardſhip ſhall tame him whom nothing elſe will tame, or elſe at the end of his wilde race, he ſhall ſtake himſelfe as it were, upon the vengeance of God and eternall death.</p>
            <p>Yet another fault, <hi>Every mans hand was againſt him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <p n="3">3. Hee was a quarrellſome fellow. Gen. 16.12.</p>

This is the fault that is deſcribed in theſe words; Now a ſore ſinne it is that makes a man troubleſome to himſelfe and all his neighbours, and cauſeth his life to be like the life of a Cocke of the game, that is ſtill bloudy with the bloud of others and himſelfe. I pray you examine your ſelves whether you be not ſuch froward contentious men, ſtill in ſuite, in conteſtation, in oppoſition with ſome or other, that will take no ſhew of wrong, but will doe enough, that cannot long keepe out of ſome brabling matter. If it be a legall kind of quarrelling, it is a ſigne of much folly, much pride, or both, much more if it be a kind of martiall quarrelling that tends to ſtroakes and bloudſhed. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, repent of this evill humour, and ſeeke to God to give you a meeke and quiet ſpirit, able to beare and forbeare, able to ſhew kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and to paſſe by unkindneſſe, for ſurely it is a kind of diabolicall life to live ſo unquietly, and it will cauſe Gods hand to be ſtretched out againſt him, whoſe hand is againſt every body. And theſe are <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels</hi> faults.</p>
            <p>Now his benefits are, Firſt, deliverance from two great dangers,<note place="margin">His Benefits. 1.

A great benefit it was and the foundation of his future worldly greatneſſe.

Let not ſuch a benefit be forgotten, and let us learne to truſt upon him ever after, and not to be carkingly troubled with caſting dangers before hand and diſquieting our ſelves with feares, becauſe we ſee no way out, God will have a Well in ſtore and ſhew it us at the exigent.</p>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:27208:96"/>
yet it was ſo by chance alone and as it fell out, and if it had beene otherwiſe, yet they would have taken it ſo that no thankes was due to any religious care of theirs if it were otherwiſe. Repent therefore of your haſtineſſe and heedeleſneſſe in ſwearing, this is to ſhew your ſelves ſuch as doe not feare an oath, and ſo doe not duely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and honour the great Majeſty of God, whoſe name in ſwearing you invocate againſt your ſelves.</p>
            <p>Therefore alſo thoſe that miniſter an oath muſt not be diſpleaſed at ſuch cautelouſneſſe, but muſt readily ſatisfie the doubts and ſcruples of thoſe that ſweare, that with good conſcience and a quiet minde they may take it upon them, for ſeeing they be carefull before they ſweare to underſtand what they ſweare unto, it giveth good hope that after they have ſworne they will be as carefull that they keepe it, and ſo their oath ſhall be to ſome purpoſe, which ſhould very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ſatisfie him that gives them the oath. But he that will ſpeedily and without conſidering take an oath, will alſo be as ready to breake it, alledging his former ignorance or miſtaking, as an excuſe of his not fulfilling it. Hitherto of his devotion to God in reſpect of his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry entring into an oath.</p>

            <p>Here learne, that when you have ſworne you muſt not delay the performance of it, but ſo ſoone as ſhall be convenient, and as you have power, muſt ſettle to doe the thing ſworne to. All you that have ſworne any lawfull and poſſible thing, looke on <hi>Abrahams</hi> godly ſervant and be mindfull of your oathes, conſider the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God to whom you are tied, and put not off the worke from time to time, ſeeke not needleſſe delayes, make not fearefull or ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full excuſes, but free your faith and pull your ſelves out of the danger of Gods diſpleaſure by a conſcionable fulfilling of your oathes.

            <p>But what if we perceive the oath to have beene of an unlawfull thing?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, then we muſt repent of our naughtineſſe in taking it, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:27208:96"/>
ſo forbeare to add a ſecond ſinne in doing that which is unlawfull. For it is impoſſible that an oath ſhould be of more force to binde a man to a thing, then Gods Commandement is to reſtraine him from it. Nothing can have more force to binde conſcience then Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
            <p>But what if it proove impoſſible?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, if that impoſſibility might have beene foreſeene, our raſhneſſe in not foreſeeing it muſt be repented of, but if it could not have beene foreſeene, we muſt reſt our ſelves ſatisfied in this, that our minde was faithfully to have fulfilled it, if God had not caſt in our way ſuch an impediment, but no hazard, no coſt, no labour muſt ſtand betwixt us and the accompliſhing of our oathes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.4.</note> for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, that <hi>a good man ſweares to his hinderance,</hi> and <hi>yet fulfills.</hi> 'Twere better for a man to be undone in the world or to looſe this naturall life, then to breake his oath for feare of loſſe or death.

A good and godly ſervant when he imployeth himſelfe in his Maſters worke, muſt ſhew himſelfe to be Gods ſervant and to have faith in his providence, truſting in his goodneſſe and bleſſing more then in his owne ability. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch a particular begging of ſuch and ſuch occurrents to ſhew us Gods minde was peculiar to him, and is not required of us, for he did it by the peculiar inſpiration of Gods Spirit, but in generall to beg Gods aſſiſtacce that belongs to all good Servants. You that would be counted godly ſervants, have you thus ſanctified your indeavours by prayer? have you thus called on his name to guide and ſpeed you? if you have, you have done well, take comfort in it, it is a teſtimony that you ſerve for conſcience ſake, not as men-pleaſers, and that you ſerve the Lord in ſerving your Maſters, if you have not, be humbled and lament it, as a matter of prophaneſſe and a cauſe of many croſſes and a meanes to make you proud of your ſelves, if good ſucceſſe attend you. And now tread hereafter in the ſteps of this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Servant. Pray, pray to him for his aſſiſtance and bleſſing upon your ſelves, and the workes you take in hand for your Maſters, that ſo it may appeare you doe all in faith and obedience to God.</p>

you muſt learne with all humble behaviour of body and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of mind and with all ſincerity and heartineſſe to praiſe God for your good ſucceſſe, and ſo it will appeare that you aſcribe all to God and not to your ſelves.

            <p>And now let us all learne to be particularly thankfull to God for particular benefits, yea even ſuch outward benefits, much more for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. This is the way to continue, to ſanctifie, and increaſe benefits, God loveth thankfullneſſe as men alſo doe.

            <p>Firſt for his goodneſſe in generall, he hath the teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt by the pen of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that he was a righteous man.

Well, <hi>Lot</hi> left his Countrey, and ſo ſhewed himſelfe a Pilgrim and ſtranger on earth together with <hi>Abraham,</hi> for though he inherited not <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet becauſe he left the falſe gods which were ſerved by his kindred in <hi>Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi> to ſerve the true God which <hi>Abraham</hi> went to ſerve, it prooveth, that hee had faith in that God and was accepted to life.</p>
            <p>You muſt all learne to be ready to forſake falſe gods and cleave to the true, if ever you deſire to inherit ſalvation.

He was burdened with it, and even laboured under it as under a burden, hee was alſo upon the rack with it. He grieved ſo for it, that hee would faine have amended it, and not finding that poſſible it was a torture unto him to ſee it growing more and more.

If we grieve for ſin we ſhall be preſerved from the contagion of it, and keepe our ſelves unſpotted in the common pollution: but if wee have not ſo much grace as to bewaile it, we ſhall quickly ſhew our ſelves ſo weake as
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:27208:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to fall to the imitating it at leaſt in ſome degrees. Yea the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> noteth, that the mourners were marked out for deliverance, as <hi>Noah</hi> was in the deſtruction of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now come let mee enquire of you my Brethren. Doe you take the ſinnes of others heavily? doe they pierce your hearts with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? Are they burdens to you? Ah, how many doe rather rejoyce, in ſeeing other mens evills in ſecret, and joyne with them in the ſame exceſſe of riot, are glad to ſee and heare lewdneſſe from others,<note place="margin">So in drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe.</note> and to joyne with them it. What are theſe? how farre from deſerving to be called righteous? But even of thoſe that be righteous (as wee hope there are ſome) ſo farre inferiour are they to <hi>Lot</hi> in goodneſſe, though having farre better meanes then any <hi>Sodome</hi> affoorded, they ought alſo to be better perſons, that few teares ſerve them, and little ſorrow is found in them for the common ſinnes. The common oathes, curſing, Sabbath-breaking which are every where rife, doe not grieve them at all. One little trifling loſſe or croſſe hath made them more take on with ſorrow, then all the diſorders of the Land. It is but weake goodneſſe that is not ſenſible of the contrary both in it ſelfe and others too, and it is but little ſenſible of it that is but little grieved for it.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, our land is not like <hi>Sodome</hi> that wee ſhould live in it ſo as <hi>Lot</hi> did there.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, God be thanked in ſome things it is not, and in publike the faults breake not out that there were done openly, but many of the ſonnes of <hi>Sodome</hi> are bare-fac'd amongſt us, and wee looke upon them without remorſe. You muſt be ſorry that you have not beene more ſorry for the publike iniquity. Surely if a ſcourge come it ſhall take you away with the reſt, becauſe you have not ſhewed your zeale of Gods glory and deteſtation of ſinne in the rebellions of the reſt.</p>
            <p>And now ſet you to it, ſet you to it, it is ſaid, that <hi>Lot</hi> did put his ſoule upon the racke, he was an actor in this ſorrow, he put himſelfe upon it. I ſay he was even willing to exerciſe himſelfe in grieving for their naughtineſſe, and he ſtrove to make his ſorrow piercing. O you muſt labour to doe this as well as any other good worke, to chafe and grudge and be furious againſt ſuch a ſinner and ſuch a ſinner, to jeſt, ſcoffe, and gird, or raile, and bitterly inveigh againſt ſuch and ſuch ſinnes, be ſuch ſtraines and flaſhes of wit and anger, as may be found in men of no true holineſſe, but to get alone and even ſell over himſelfe to ſighing, mourning, and lamentation for the common ſinnes that are every where runne into, this can hardly be aſcribed to any thing but true piety, if the ſinnes be ſuch as doe not in any particular reſpect touch a mans ſelfe in way of wrong and injury. Indeed to grieve for ſuch ſinnes of others, may ſeeme in ſome reſpect as a more difficult thing, ſo a more ſure ſigne of truth then to grieve for ones owne ſinnes, you ſhall ſee men driven to teares for their owne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences in reſpect of ſhame or loſſe, and ſometimes terrour of heart,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:27208:101"/>
but grieving for the common ſinnes can hardly proceed from any thing but charity to them as they be men, and hatred againſt ſinne as it is ſinne. If a meere friend of our owne have offended, wee are ſo tender of his reproach, becauſe it is ſomewhat linked with our owne, that many men can blubber for it exceedingly. O let us love the Common-wealth ſo well and the ſtate of mankinde, as to yeeld ſome of our ſorrow to quicken us in prayer againſt their ſinnes.</p>

               <hi>uſe hoſpitality one to another without grudging. Gajus</hi> hath this commendation, that he was the Hoſt of the Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.23. and a Miniſter is expreſſely commanded to be hoſpitall. This is a rich mans duty, I meane his that hath ſome indifferent proportion of wealth, he that hath but one bed or roome muſt lie abroad him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or ſit up all night if he lodge ſtrangers. But of thoſe that have to ſpare, the Lord requireth a free communicating of what they have to others. May not wee be ſtrangers? may not our children and neere friends be ſtrangers? will not our hearts tell us? that it would bee a very ill part in them that ſhould in ſuch caſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect us.</p>
            <p>But I am to commend unto you a kinde of hoſpitality ſomewhat of another nature, a ſtranger of any faſhion by meanes of Innes, which it ſeemes that age did not know, is able to be hoſpitall to himſelfe with his money, even to buy all things needfull: but alas you have poore neighbours and kinſmen in the ſame Towne, or neere hand inhabiting, O invite them to your houſes, make them cheerefull with a good meale now and then, that have little provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at home.

            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:27208:101"/>Another good deed we have of <hi>Lot,</hi> He went out, and earneſtly,<note place="margin">4. He intreated the <hi>Sodomites</hi> to deſiſt from their villany.</note> yet lovingly and gently intreated the <hi>Sodomites</hi> to deſiſt from their villany, <hi>My Brethren I pray doe not ſo wickedly,</hi> and againe, <hi>to theſe men doe nothing, for therefore came they under my roofe, Gen.</hi> 19.7, 8. He would faine have ſtopped theſe miſcreants from their abominable attempt; If we ſee men ruſhing into ſinfull courſes wee ſhall doe a good office of charity if with all good termes and gentle language we diſſwade them from wickedneſſe. If wee muſt reproove af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſinne, ſure wee muſt diſſwade aforehand: <hi>Eli</hi> diſſwaded his ſonnes from perſiſting in evill, <hi>Abigail</hi> diſſwaded <hi>David</hi> from murder; what ſinne wee hinder not to our beſt power, that we cauſe to be written in our owne ſcore, and inwrap our ſelves within the guilt of it. Who would not intreate his neighbour hard not to drinke a cup of poyſon? If therefore any man have done the contrary, inſtigated others to ſinne, and egged them forward rather then held them back, ſurely his offence is great, he hath beene not alone a helper but a father of the fault, and unleſſe hee repent muſt anſwer for it as much as the principall. But though you have not forgotten your duty in ſo high a degree as to moove others to evill, yet if you have ſo much neglected your duty as to forbeare to diſſwade and hinder them, either out of careleſneſſe or feare, you are to be humbled for it, as an effect of want of love and zeale. And now I pray you doe this good office often, if you ſee a man going about an evill thing, take up <hi>Lots</hi> words and ſay, I pray you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren doe not ſo wickedly, intreate him to forbeare the doing of the like for the future. A loving intreaty will ſometimes proove of great efficacy. Had they beene any but <hi>Sodomites, Lot</hi> ſhould not have beene ſo churliſhly rejected.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, I ſhall but looſe my labour.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, what if you doe? you have loſt many worſe labours. Secondly, I ſay who can tell? why will you thinke ſo hardly of your Brother?</p>

            <p>Yet another good deed of <hi>Lots</hi> was that he fought to deliver his ſonnes in Law, and perſwaded them to get them out of <hi>Sodome</hi> too.<note place="margin">5.

               </note>The laſt good thing I will note, though it ſhould have beene brought in before as being done before, was this, for a good while together hee kept cloſe to his Unkle, went with him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> came with him out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and dwelt neere him, I meane in <hi>Canaan.</hi> It is a good thing to love the company of good men, and delight to dwell with or neere them, and happier had it beene for <hi>Lot</hi> if hee had not ſuffered himſelfe to be divided from his Unkle.

And ſo much for <hi>Lots</hi> goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His faults. 1. He choſe to dwell in a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſinfull men.</note>Now his badneſſe. And I will begin there where he began, firſt to ſhew it. He choſe rather to dwell in a rich fertile place amongſt vile ſinfull men then with ſome earthly inconveniencies with a godly and faithfull man, ſo ſhewing too great a love to riches, and too ſmall a love to goodneſſe. I beſeech you if any of you be ſo minded that you will take notice of it as a fault. To be ſo much ingaged to earthly things, that for the more eaſie obtaining of a large quantity thereof, a man can be content to pitch his Tents in <hi>Sodome</hi> and to dwell there, is too great a proofe of a worldly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man. It was the beginning of <hi>Lots</hi> ruine. In choice of your habitation looke chiefely to the good of the ſoule. If you doe not, be aſſured that ſome way or other God will croſſe you as he did <hi>Lot.</hi> We ſhall leſſe beare out thoſe faults with impunity for which the godly in Scripture have ſmarted before us, becauſe men did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive warning by the dealing of God with them. The brother is whipt more ſeverely that ſeeing another brother corrected before him was bold yet to ruſh into the ſame fault. Doe not commit the fault that coſt <hi>Lot</hi> ſo deare a price. Leave not a good place for the ſoule to get a great benefit for the body; let not the world ſway you, neither wholy nor chiefely in chooſing the place of your habitation. <hi>Lot</hi> ſhould have ſaid, Unkle, ſo much content and good doe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from your good ſelfe unto my ſoule, that I will make an hard ſhift afore I will leave you, yea I will rather abridge my cattell then looſe your company, or at leaſt, I will be content to take a place neere you though it be not ſo fat and fruitfull as ſome other places: Doe you, as your owne underſtanding (now that you ſee the whole carriage of things) will teach you, that <hi>Lot</hi> ought to have done. And ſo much for this fault.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. He continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dwell in <hi>Sodome</hi> among great ſinners.</note>Now againe, worldlineſſe continued to grow ſtronger in <hi>Lot,</hi> for hee continued to dwell in <hi>Sodome,</hi> even though they were excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great ſinners. It was well done that he grieved for their ſinnes, it would have beene better done if he had forſaken the City. Hee might have departed of his owne accord with farre leſſe loſſe, then God forc't him out at length. Sure it is a fault, if a man can poſſibly remove, to make his conſtant aboad in an extreame wicked place, where heinous and foule ſinnes are uſually and impudently commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for if a mans ſelfe eſcape the infection, yet it is too too probable
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:27208:102"/>
that his children ſhall be defiled, and catch the ſinnes of the places as the daughters of <hi>Lot</hi> and moſt of his ſervants did, for had they beene righteous they ſhould have eſcaped with him. And moſt times if any man that hath any the leaſt goodneſſe, doe ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ſo neighboured, it is a fruit of ſome carnall paſſion or other, in favour of which he hardens himſelfe to endure ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable thing, as the continuall hearing and beholding of great wickedneſſe. Let us take heed no ſuch thing in inveigle us to pitch out Tents in any <hi>Sodome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But againe, <hi>Lot</hi> I think, offended in going about to match his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with any of the wicked generation of the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> What could he finde none other in all the world to give his children for wives but to two wicked men in that wicked City? Would he be content to have his children, his childrens childrens children, and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity to live in that little hell, and to be indangered unto the like abhominations? Surely the love of the world prevailed here with him more then it ought to have. It is a fault too common with us, many a Father is regardleſſe how bad the place and family be into which he matcheth his daughter, ſo the ſtate be good. Be the Towne as bad as <hi>Sodome,</hi> and the perſon as prophane as theſe men, yet a good living will make them to plant their children in ſuch a garden, as it were, or wilderneſſe rather. I cannot conceive but that this is a proofe of mans too high eſteeming of outward things, and I beſeech you Fathers learne of <hi>Lot,</hi> provide better for the placing of your children.</p>
            <p>Another fault of <hi>Lots</hi> is,<note place="margin">3. He offered his two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites.</hi>
               </note> that he did offer his two daughters to the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> ſaying. <hi>Doe to them what ſeemeth good in your eyes.</hi> Out of a deſire to ſave his gueſts from villany he proſtitutes thoſe that ſhould have beene dearer to him then any gueſts: and ſo would redeeme the ſtrangers from wrong with the hazard of his childrens chaſtity. He is to be ſomewhat excuſed by the preſent occaſion, in that hurrie and diſtemper he had not leaſure to conſider well of the thing he did, but through haſt was puſhed forward to doe ſo great an hurt unto the two maides. Hee doth evill here that good may come of it, a thing that S. <hi>Paul</hi> would never allow, for he ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, <hi>God forbid.</hi> The doing of evill is ſimply ſinfull,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.2.</note> the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of evill not ſo, wherefore a man ſhould reſolve rather to be a patient in the greateſt evill then an agent in the farre leſſer. In doing any evill a man doth diſobey God and tranſgreſſeth his Law, in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it he doth alone receive miſery to himſelfe: now the greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is not ſo great an evill as the leaſt ſinne. It behooveth us to take heed that our carnall reaſon doe never ſo over-ſway us, no not on the ſuddaine, that wee ſhould conſent to act any evill for the procuring of any good. And if wee have done otherwiſe, wee are to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to our ſelves as a great weakeneſſe,<note place="margin">4. He lingred in <hi>Sodome</hi> till the Angels tooke him by the hand.</note> and ſo to confeſſe it and humble our ſelves for it before God.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Lot</hi> lingred in <hi>Sodome</hi> till the Angels tooke him by the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:27208:103"/>
hand and in a kind of gratious violence ſet him in ſafety againſt his will. Willing hee was to eſcape the deſtruction which was now falling upon <hi>Sodome,</hi> but loath he was to ſave his life at ſo deare a rate as the looſing of all his ſubſtance. It is a ſinne to cleave ſo faſt in affection to goods, as not to be willing with the loſſe of all to ſave out lives. He loves riches too well that will caſt his life upon great danger for the ſaving of them, and not gladly leave them all to free his life from perdition. Satan could ſay, <hi>Skinne for skinne and all that a man hath will hee give for the redemption of his life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 2.4.</note> If wee have at any time found our heart ſo glewed to wealth, that we have beene lingring about it, to the manifeſt indangering of our lives, much more our ſoules, we ſhould even heartily condemne our ſelves for too great lovers of riches.</p>
            <p>Another ſinne in <hi>Lot,</hi> was, that he was too timerous and durſt not commit himſelfe to the Mountaines (whither yet he was faine at length to flie) for feare leaſt ſome or other miſchiefe might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him there, and therefore was he ſo over-importunate for the ſparing of that City, becauſe it was little, might he not as well have truſted the Angels direction as his owne conceits, and ſought and expected ſafety in the Mountaines, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to eſcape thither. Doubtleſſe, it is a fault not to truſt God with our welfare, but to caſt in our heads, what evill may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us there where he doth ſend us for ſafety. Let us not yeeld to our owne fancies, nor frame perill to make us diſcontent with that eſtate to which God doth call us, for we ſhall finde at length, that our owne hopes will deceive us, and we ſhall be never the farther of from danger, becauſe we followed our owne heads. <hi>Let mee goe to Zoar</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and my ſoule ſhall live,</hi> but after, he found that his ſoule could not live with comfort there. Live where God would have us live, and looke for his protection there where it ſhall pleaſe him to appoint us to live.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">6. Hee was twice drunken.</note>Now I come to his two laſt offences, he ſuffered himſelfe to be made drunken by his daughters two ſeverall times, one ſhortly after another. You ſee how a good man may be overtaken with grievous ſinnes, and drawne by thoſe whom he loveth and truſteth to grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous abhominations. O let us feare our ſelves and pittie others, and take heed wee ſuffer not our neereſt friends to be a ſnare unto us. Eſpecially beware of drunkenneſſe, it is not alone a great offence it ſelfe, but laies us open to all other crimes. Make a man drunken, and he will eaſily be drawne to defloure his owne daughter. Keepe your ſelves from exceſſive drinking of wine or ſtrong drink. It is raging, it is mocking, it will change you into very beaſts, and make you runne into ſuch crimes, as your ſoules at other times would even loath to thinke of. Labour to be temperate, or elſe you do hardly be chaſte and modeſt. Deprive not your ſelves of reaſon by pleaſing your palate, expoſe not your ſelves to the danger of the fouleſt of all ſinnes, by ſo baſe a pleaſure as ſatisfying the taſt with
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:27208:103"/>
the reliſh of this liquor. And all you Governours and Magiſtrates, ſet your ſelves with all diligent ſeverity to prevent and beate downe drunkenneſſe; if this offence abound, all other evills will abound with it.</p>
            <p>Now wee come to <hi>Lots</hi> benefits. Firſt,<note place="margin">His benefits. 1. God gave him repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> God drew him out of his ſinnes and gave him repentance, elſe S. <hi>Peters</hi> words had not beene true, that called him a juſt man. O how great a mercy of God is this? not to call us from the ſtate of corruption at firſt, but when wee have almoſt departed backe againe to folly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call us from our grievous ſinnes, and heale our wounded ſoules, by cauſing us to repent unfainedly. Preſume not on this mercy, but if you have found it, praiſe God moſt earneſtly for it, and let not the greatneſſe of ſinne diſcourage you from returning unto God againe, for ſuch is his grace, that he will readily receive you after ſuch wandrings.</p>
            <p>Againe, you ſee that God gave him riches great ſtore, the Lord can give the ſame to other of his people with as plentifull a hand, but if hee doe not, you ſee in <hi>Lot</hi> what cauſe there is not to murmure; for riches did undoe <hi>Lot</hi> almoſt, and therefore was God faine to take them all againe, becauſe hee could not ſo uſe them as not to ſet his heart too much upon them. If God hath beene pleaſed to grant you theſe things, let <hi>Lots</hi> example make you carefull to keepe your hearts from being too much inamoured of them.</p>
            <p>Further,<note place="margin">2. He and his were delivered out of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Lot</hi> obtained a gracious deliverance for himſelfe and his wife and his daughters out of the burning of <hi>Sodome,</hi> hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their ſinnes and eſcapeth the puniſhment. Learne the beſt way to ſave your ſelves from common ſtroakes, even by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the common ſinnes, and prooving your ſelves to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons. Yea, God yeelded much to <hi>Lots</hi> weakeneſſe in granting him leave to goe to <hi>Zoar,</hi> and ſaving that City alſo for his ſake. Surely God is as ready alſo now to paſſe by weakeneſſes, and will much more willingly grant the better digeſted petitions of his ſervants.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Lots</hi> miſery,<note place="margin">His afflictions were foure.</note> firſt hee was taken Captive and loſt all his goods.

Prepare to looſe all you have, eſpecially if you finde your ſoules over-earneſtly addicted to them, and cauſe not God to pull them out of your hands by ſetting your hearts upon them. Prepare your hearts to looſe your yoake-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes by ſome ſtrange and unexpected accidents. Prepare to have your children naught and wicked, and take heed that your owne folly in chooſing for wealths ſake an evill place of habitation be not an inſtrument of making them ſuch, yea learne to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that God hath yet ſaved you from ſuch miſeries, and make your ſmaller croſſes ſeeme lighter to you then elſe they

               </note> Secondly, ſhee was delivered out of the burning of <hi>Sodome</hi> together with her Husband and Daughters, ſaving that ſhee made the benefit unprofitable to her ſelfe by her ſinning.</p>

               <note place="margin">Her ſin, ſhee looked back to <hi>Sodome.</hi>
               </note>And her ſinne though it ſeemed little in reſpect, yet indeed was very great. The matter was ſmall, the tranſgreſſion was great, as in great poyſon, fullneſſe may be found in a ſmall quantity of liquor, even in a drop or leſſe then a drop. Shee was forbidden by the Angell that ſent her forth to looke backe to <hi>Sodome</hi> and yet expreſſely againſt that charge ſhee did looke backe, the cauſe of that prohibition may ſeeme to have beene this, the Lord knowing her too eager affection to the goods ſhee left behinde her, would have her now caſt off that inordinate paſſion, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the goodneſſe of God in giving her her life for a prey, not ſo much as to turne and looke towards <hi>Sodome,</hi> but truſt God for goods who had now vouchſafed them life, but ſhee belike thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (as many of us would have thought) as good die as be ſent away a beggar and deſtitute of all things, could not keepe her heart conſtant in taking notice of the great benefit of eſcaping the fire, but out of griefe to leave houſe and all after her, turned backe to ſalute them once againe with her eye. This ſinne was compounded of diſobedience to God ſpeaking in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, and diſ-eſteeme of the preſent mercy and over-grieving the loſſe of her wealth.</p>
            <p>Take heed you give not your ſelves leave to commit a thing expreſſely forbidden, for uſually much naughtineſſe concurreth to produce ſuch an act, ſo the Lord that ſearcheth the heart accounteth that great, which your blindneſſe maketh you to eſteeme nothing, and ſo to puniſh it many times with ſome heavie puniſhment. As it befell this woman,<note place="margin">Her puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> her puniſhment was to be turned into a Pillar of ſalt. The Lord inſtantly ſmote her with death, and taking her ſoule from her body changed the body into a pillar, which whether it be called a pillar of ſalt, becauſe it was of that matter, or becauſe of the everlaſting continuance of it, as an everlaſting Covenant is called a

            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">

            <p>Their firſt ſinne was,<note place="margin">1. They agreed together about two grievous crimes.</note> that they conſulted together and agreed about a moſt abhominable ſinne, nay a paire of grievous crimes at once. In which, the firſt-borne did make the motion, and the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger gave her conſent. In the conſultation about it, ſee what reaſon induced, and what it is to which they were induced by that reaſon. The reaſon is, 1. Their Fathers age,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.31.</note> who being now ſhortly to leave the world, they would not have his off-ſpring periſh in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:27208:106"/>
2. The want of other men to company with them, <hi>there is not a man in all the earth to come in unto us after the earth.</hi> They wanted other husbands to beget children of them in lawfull matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie; Surely their late abode in <hi>Zoar</hi> might cauſe them to know, that the whole world was not deſtroyed, if they meant that there was never another man left with whom they might joyne themſelves, they did beguile themſelves too too palpably, for onely <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha,</hi> and <hi>Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> foure Cities of the plaine were conſumed with fire from Heaven, the reſt ſtood in their former eſtate. <hi>Zoar</hi> they had ſeene ſtanding and left it with their Father, and ſeeing they dwelt upon a Mountaine, they could not but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne other Cities round about, for that Countrey was full of Townes and people. It is like therefore, that they meant none neere unto us, none of our blood and kindred. But why ſhould they make doubt of marrying any other beſides their owne kindred. They had beene betrothed to husbands in <hi>Sodome,</hi> might they not as well marrie any other Cananite as a Citizen of <hi>Sodome.</hi> It is apparant that their reaſons were frivolous and vaine, yet upon them they build a full reſolution of committing two fearefull offences, for they agree together ſaying, <hi>Come let us make our Father drinke Wine, and then let us lie with him to preſerve ſeed of him.</hi> They would ſeeme each to other to be carried with libidinous fancies as if luſt led them, but that a deſire of preſerving ſeed was the motive to the villanous deſigne.</p>
            <p>Wee ſee how mans nature is eaſily drawne by weake and poore grounds to runne into very loathſome and foule crimes. Better the world ſhould have wanted continuance and ended in their perſons, then have it ſtored with an inceſtuous off-ſpring. No other mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together of man and woman, if it had beene in the way of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, is ſimply and of it ſelfe unlawfull, but onely that of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children, for there was a time when the Brother married the ſiſter without fault, as in the beginning when the world had no other perſons in it but brethren and ſiſters, but never at any time was it lawfull for the daughters to have the Father or the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſonne. This therefore was the moſt unlawfull mixture in the ſame kinde and of different Sexe that poſſibly could be. Yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſlender pretext that they knew not how to come by any other man, and ſo their Fathers poſterity ſhould periſh, they conſent to accompliſh it. Had they not beene made more then ordinarily immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt with the converſation of impure <hi>Sodomites,</hi> they would have beene reſtrained with ſhame and bluſhing, from opening any ſuch thought each to other, had it beene to have ſolicited another man, much more their Father. But cuſtome of hearing and ſeeing ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deeds will baniſh ſhame quite away, and make men bold to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt their wicked conceits one to another, which elſe modeſty would never ſuffer them to ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>Here indeed the more aged maiden is moſt blame-worthy, for the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:27208:106"/>
Spirit of God witneſſeth that ſhee was the firſt moover to this lewdneſſe, but the younger was greatly to be blamed alſo, for ſhee conſented to ſuch a motion. Let thoſe that be of more age take heede of giving wicked counſell to the younger, and let the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger take heede of opening their eares to lewde advice. Let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware wee ſuffer not our ſelves to be drawne upon pretence of I know not what neceſſity or urgent occaſion, to reſolve on things plainely ſinfull, eſpecially ſuch as are extreamely groſſe and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. No neceſſity can excuſe an evill deed, much leſſe when it is none other but a counterfeit and falſe appearance of neceſſity. Would theſe ſiſters have deferred their deſires a while, they might have found their Father at length willing to have left that hole in a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and to have converſed againe amongſt men. Why had they not rather perſwaded him to leave that ſolitary kinde of living, and betaken himſelfe to his Unkle <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was not growne either ſo niggardly or unkinde, but that he would have welcomed them with good entertainement. Why had they not taken up any reſolution, rather then venture on this monſtrous abomination? Let not the Divell and carnall reaſon beſet us ſo farre, as to faine to ourſelves a neceſſity of evill-doing, and then to grow bold to doe evill.</p>
            <p>But what did they doe now, to make their Father inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? Surely make him drinke wine not moderately and in due quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, for then his wits would have beene his owne ſtill, and his ſanctified conſcience would have armed him ſufficieently againſt all their moſt wanton carriages; yea the gravity of his countenance and parentall authority would have affrighted them from laſcivious words and geſtures, that tended to produce ſuch an effect. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make him ſtarke drunke with wine, making him by little and little take into him ſuch a quantity as would bury his underſtanding, conſcience and all, and turne him into a bruit creature, and then they doubt not but that they may eaſily allure him to commit folly with them. A fearefull ſinne it is to reſolve before hand upon ſuch a wickedneſſe as this, and that alſo as a loade-ſtone to draw on another worſe wickedneſſe. To make one drunke for any cauſe is bad enough, but to make him drunke of purpoſe to make him filthy after, that is much worſe. Here is a moſt wicked end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, which would make a thing it ſelfe otherwiſe lawfull ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſinnefull, if done for ſuch a purpoſe. Here is alſo a meanes utterly wicked, though it had beene uſed for a moſt lawfull end, but when end and meanes are both ſo remarkeably and exorbitantly ſinfull, how great was that ſinne. Had they began alone to drinke for cheerefull refreſhing of themſelves and their old Father, and then one cup drawing on another had at unawares made both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Father drunke, and then unpurpoſedly fallen to wanton imbraces and ſo to inceſt, that had beene ſinne enough. But to take advice upon it, to determine before hand, that is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:27208:107"/>
fully that they would doe ſuch a thing, this ſhewes that they had ſmothered their conſciences, and were indeed void of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>O take heed of giving your ſelves leave deliberately to ſinne, take heed of ſetting downe a wicked concluſion in your mindes, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, come and let us doe this or this that you know is naught. This is not to ſlip into the mire but to wallow in it, this is a preſumptuous and a wilfull ſinne. This is to yeeld your ſelves captives to ſinne, and to ſhew your ſelves ſervants of it. And if any one hath in ſuch ſort ſinned, great repentance is needfull to waſh away ſo great a crime.</p>
            <p>But if they had agreed in haſt to perpetrate this lewdneſſe and yet before the time came of acting it, had called to mind the loathſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſinne, and repenting of their naughty intention, forborne to proceed, the matter would not have beene ſo fowle, then it might have beene attributed to weakeneſſe and haſt. But they goe on in it, the elder ſhee firſt begins, and then ſhe renewes the matter to her Siſter, who is eaſily perſwaded to follow her, and ſo they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to doe evill and performe it alſo. This is a great aggravation of ſinne, that if one have ſome leiſure betwixt the reſolving and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, yet he hath perſiſted in his wicked reſolution, and wanted the grace to change his mind. Perſiſting in an evill purpoſe, ſhewes much blindneſſe of mind and hardneſſe of heart, and proves that God hath for puniſhment of wilfulneſſe even given one over to his owne hearts luſts.</p>
            <p>But now the elder begins to offend, as it were to imbolden her Siſter, as if ſhee ſhould ſay, I will begin if thou wilt come after, I will doe it to night if thou wilt ſecond mee another night, ſo ſhe ſinnes of purpoſe to give her Siſter a bad example, to animate her to the like. Thoſe ſinnes are very grievous, in which a man ſeekes not alone to ſatisfie his owne evill deſires, but alſo to corrupt another, and draw him to the like evill. The ſinne is greater by how much more love of ſinne is diſcovered, and he loves ſinne exceeding much, that labours to increaſe the number of its ſervants.</p>
            <p>Further, having layne with her Father, ſhee ſpeakes of it to her Siſter, rather in way of boaſting then out of ſhame, and perſwades her alſo to doe the like. It is a wickedneſſe of an high nature to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit great ſinnes, and after be touched with no remorſe for them, yea rather to talke of them with a bold face, as if they were deedes at leaſt not deſerving blame, and when wee have done evill, to preſſe our examples upon others to imitate. It ſeemes the younger Siſter would not have followed, but that the elder provoked her the ſecond time. To uſe a kind of importunity towards another, and preſſe them againe and againe to naughtineſſe, is a proofe of one ſet upon ſinne with a full bent of will.</p>
            <p>Now the ſecond Siſter, ſhe followes her Siſters evill deeds, and evill counſell, and they commit the ſame ſinne the ſecond time with the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:27208:107"/>
ſame wilfulneſſe, for the elder is as guilty of her Siſters inceſt as of her owne. Men having tranſgreſſed the bounds of modeſty,<note place="margin">Qui ſemel ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recundiae limites tranſiluerit, graviter impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentem eſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portet.</note> grow extreamely careleſſe, and eaſily commit the ſecond time what they have ventured upon the firſt. It is more difficulty to forbeare repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a ſinne then committing it, as it is to drive out an enemy then to keepe him out. Give ſinne a ſtrong deniall at firſt, ſo ſhall we be ſooneſt rid of it.</p>
            <p>Now let us conſider the offences themſelves,<note place="margin">Their owne ſinne, they make their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drunken.</note> for hitherto we have looked alone into certaine aggravations of them. Firſt to make a man drunke, this is a grievous ſinne, a purpoſed lying in waite to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come another with wine or ſtrong drinke, is a foule fault; it hath its originall ever in ſome further evill intention, either to laugh at the offenders, or otherwiſe to wrong them, as here, and draw them to ſome wickedneſſe or inconvenience, which elſe they would not be drawne unto. He ſeekes miſchiefe to his neighbour, that ſeekes to ſpoile him of his underſtanding, and makes him a beaſt, that he may draw him to beaſtly deeds. Come now and conſider your ſelves, if none of you have thus ſinned againſt your bretheren. He is worſe then a drunkard, that is a maker of drunkards; a man may be drunke of meere weakeneſſe, but it is wilfulneſſe that cauſeth another to be drunken. He loves this ſinne more, that cauſeth it in another, then hee that commits the ſame himſelfe; If any of you have ſo ſinned againſt his brother, he is a very lewd man, and muſt anſwer for that ſinne before God with more ſeverity then the perſon that hath beene drawne into it by his meanes. Much repentance therefore is required of ſuch an offender.</p>
            <p>In keeping himſelfe ſober for an evill end, hee is worſe then if himſelfe had beene drunken for company. Theſe two ſiſters did keepe themſelves free from exceſſe, that they might better abuſe their owne reaſon to worke upon their Fathers unreaſonableneſſe. Had they beene all overcome of wine, inceſt had not ſo eaſily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed from drunkenneſſe; but now that the man is ſwallowed up of wine, and the woeman not ſo, they prevailed more eaſily to make their Father lewd. It is a drunken ſobriety that is directed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſſe, they would not be drunken becauſe they deſired to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Some men boaſt that themſelves have borne their cups where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with another hath beene overcome, but that ſoberneſſe makes them greater offenders, then if they exceeded meaſure in drinking. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt blame your ſelves with exceeding deteſtation of your ſelves, if you have abuſed a thing otherwiſe vertuous to make another man more vitious. Thou mad'ſt another to take cup after cup, that when he had loſt his wits, and thou kepſt thine, thou mighteſt better prevaile to draw him unto further wickedneſſe, thy ſoberneſſe was as bad and much worſe then his drunkenneſſe. O that you would ſee and lament your extreame ungraciouſneſſe in this abuſing both wit in yourſelves, and want of wit in others.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Lot</hi> is drunken and fitted for any wickedneſſe, the two
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:27208:108"/>
Siſters in their turnes goe to bed to him and ſolicite him to abuſe their bodies, and prevaile with him, becauſe he had not reaſon to know what hee did. Inceſt is a moſt unnaturall crime, yet the wicked nature of man is apt to runne into it, and that wilfully. O what a filthy heart hath a man and woman, that can tranſgreſſe all the dictates of reaſon to ſatisfie impure deſires. No perſon comes amiſſe to luſt, the Father will ſerve as well as another man, when the lewde deſire hath prevailed, they care not with whom the fault be committed ſo that it be committed. Have none of you given way ſo farre to libidinous deſires, as to mixe your ſelves unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and without marriage with thoſe, to whom you might not have drawne neere, no not in the warrantable imbraces of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? Is there not ſome inceſtuous man or woman amongſt you, yea ſome that hath not out of weakeneſſe but purpoſely run into inceſt? The crime is not ſo often committed in ſo high a degree, but yet ſometimes it falleth out in the world, that men may learne there is more evill in their nature then they would have beleeved, but that experience teacheth it; we have not another example of it in Scripture, but here are two at once, that wee might learne to know how bad a nature we have. And ſo much for their ſinnes common to both, making their Father drunke, and then going to bed to him, for matter, and for manner purpoſely and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and without any ſorrow after, for when they had borne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they give them ſuch names as prooved that they rather boaſted of the crime then bewailed it, <hi>Ammon the ſonne of my people, Moah of my Father,</hi> as if they had rejoyced at their happineſſe in being with childe by their owne Father. It is a curſed thing to ſinne, more to be ſo hardned as not to lament it afterwards, moſt to make a mans ſelfe glad of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Their ſpeciall ſinnes.</note>Their ſpeciall ſinnes are, the elder perſwades to the ſinne, then gives a bad example, and after againe incourageth her Siſter, and the younger yeelds and followes.

For the firſt, theſe three Brethren were in league with <hi>Abraham,</hi> joyned in a Covenant with him for mutuall helpe of each other againſt any that ſhould wrong any of them. Their league it may ſeeme was offenſive and defenſive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:27208:108"/>It is a wiſe and good part to live in friendſhip with godly men and to be knit to ſuch in covenants of amity,<note place="margin">It is a good thing to be a a friend to the godly.</note> peace and mutuall helpe, as <hi>Hiram</hi> King of <hi>Tyre</hi> was in covenant with <hi>David</hi> and with <hi>Salomon</hi> his ſonne after him, and it is recorded to his praiſe that hee was alwaies a lover of <hi>David.</hi> For by this meanes great benefits are brought unto a man.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he ſhall ſee their good converſation and heare their wiſe words, and enjoy their good counſell and their godly prayers and ſo be in poſſibility to be wonne to goodneſſe by them, at leaſt to a vertuous and civill converſation through their meanes,<note place="margin">Prov. 13.20.</note> for <hi>hee that walketh with the wiſe ſhall be made wiſe,</hi> as he that walketh with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhall be made worſe by them.

            <p>Againe, the Lord had undertaken with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be a friend to his friends and an enemie to his enemies, and to bleſſe them that bleſſed him as well as to curſe them that curſed him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in entertaining friendſhip with them, a man doth intereſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into ſome degree of Gods favour and bleſſing according to that promiſe, for God hath tied himſelfe as well to all <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſonnes, even all the faithfull, as well as to himſelfe; you ſee the profit of ſuch aſſociation with good men.</p>
            <p>Wherefore they muſt be reprooved that are imbittered againſt godly men and are enemies to thoſe that love God, hating men even for goodneſſe ſake, and perſecuting them for righteouſneſſe ſake, without doubt theſe provoke God to fight againſt them and to become an enemy unto them, joyning in the quarrell of the Saints, which indeed for his ſake they have taken up againſt them. It is an evill thing to be a foe to thoſe that feare God, and it ſhewes not alone an abſence of goodneſſe but alſo a great ſtrength of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He is ſurely carried by Satan at his pleaſure, and a ſlave in a great degree to the Divell, that cannot endure the image of God in a man. And yet our Lord tells his ſervants,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.22.</note> that <hi>they ſhall be hated of all men for his names ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now let every man learne of theſe three wiſe men to make choice of godly men for friends, familiars and allies. If a man be not himſelfe a worſhipper and ſervant of God, yet let him at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe like and love thoſe in whom goodneſſe ſhineth.<note place="margin">Acts 28.</note> The Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian <hi>Iulius,</hi> by being courteous and friendly to <hi>Paul</hi> who was then his priſoner gate his life and the life of his ſouldiers for a reward, for God gave unto <hi>Paul</hi> all the priſoners that were in the ſhip with him. So many bleſſings as a naturall man is capable of, he ſhall aſſuredly obtaine from God by the prayers of his ſervants, who cannot chooſe according to the precept of our Saviour, but pray for their perſecutors, much more for their friends and favourers.</p>

They helped <hi>Abraham</hi> and kept their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note>Now another good thing in theſe three brethren is this, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their covenant and confederation they did affoord helpe to <hi>Abraham</hi> and joyned their ſtrength with him, to fight againſt the foure Kings for the recovering of <hi>Lot Abrahams</hi> Couſin, and performed their part with ſo much courage, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> got the victory and wonne his brother and all the ſpoile of <hi>Sodome,</hi> for which alſo <hi>Abraham</hi> was carefull that they ſhould have a full reward, in taking their part of the booty which himſelfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare to take.</p>
            <p>This Example muſt be followed of all good men, when they have made a covenant, they muſt ſo ſtand unto it, and be ready to affoord ſuch helpe and performe all ſuch offices as by covenant they have obliged themſelves unto; Covenants and agreements muſt be duly kept, though the things be ſuch which come to be done as require labour, coſt, and hazard: for this is a practiſe of that excellent vertue of truth or fidelity, then which nothing is more needfull for the common proſperity of humane ſocieties, for unleſſe men may truſt one anothers words, what living can there be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the world, and without truſtineſſe in thoſe that make promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, there is no beleeving their promiſes and ſo the ſinewes of the world are as it were cut aſunder or cracked. Therefore in the 15. <hi>Pſalme</hi> it is indeed a ſigne of a godly man, that when hee hath ſworne in covenant or otherwiſe, he will not change though it ſhould fall out to be for his hurt. Faith requires that the thing be done which hath beene ſpoken, and how can hee challenge the name of a good man, in whom faithfullneſſe is not found? or how ſhould it be expected that hee will be faithfull with God, whom hee never ſaw that is not faithfull to his neighbour whom hee ſees daily.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let every man compare himſelfe with theſe civill righteous men, and ſee whether himſelfe hath carried himſelfe as honeſtly and juſtly as the very light of nature inſtructed them to doe. I meane whether he hath faithfully kept his covenants, for how ſhall hee be able to juſtifie his right and intereſt unto the honourable name of a true Chriſtian man, that falleth ſhort of thoſe vertues which many of the Gentiles have carefully practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>And if any mans heart accuſe him of unfaithfullneſſe and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perineſſe in this kinde, let him humble himſelfe and be much aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it. Should we not bluſh to ſee Heathens exceed us in good converſation and that our righteouſneſſe is not greater then that of the Phariſees who did at leaſt equall the Heathen in righteous dealing. Surely they ſhall never be admitted into the Kingdome of Heaven, before whom the Gentiles have gone in good behaviour of life; yet many there be profeſſing to be Chriſtians, whoſe untruſtineſſe this way filleth the mouthes of all that deale with them with juſt and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous complaints. They be ſo poſſeſſed with ſelfe-love, that when
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:27208:109"/>
they have made a covenant promiſe or compact, the leaſt diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will make them uſe the craftineſſe of wit to winde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out and neglect their covenants. They know how to tie others hard and leave themſelves looſe, through the looſeneſſe of an evill conſcience. Theſe are men that be guilty of neglecting ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, judgement, and faithfullneſſe, and if they ſtreine never ſo much at gnats and ſwallow theſe camells, our Saviour will be bold to intitle them, as he doth the Phariſees, and pronounce a woe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, ſaying, <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees Hypocrites.</hi> Learne now to be very ſorrowfull, if you have carried your ſelves more unrighteouſly in this kinde, then the honeſter ſort of thoſe have done who lived out of the confines of the Church, and be carefull to repent by their example, that their goodneſſe may not riſe up in judgement againſt you and condemne you. And reſolve with your ſelves I pray you, now to preferre your credit before any other thing in this earth, and to put your ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on loſſe and hazard, rather then incurre the deſerved reproach of men faithleſſe and diſhoneſt. It is not wittie tricks and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that will ſave you from reprehenſion before the Lord and your owne conſciences and other men, your name ſhall rot and ſtinke and become loathſome, if you deale untruſtily, though you paint your evill deeds over with never ſo faire and trim excuſes. Wit is never more abuſed, then when it is made a patron and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour for falſehood and evill dealing. Be righteous therefore in this particular, and put your ſelves in minde of your promiſes and covenants to keepe them, you cannot but know, that this is a duty your conſciences require you to doe to others, even as you deſire that they ſhould deale with you, and therefore muſt needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne you for ſuch falſitie which your ſelves with open mouth are ready to cry out againſt in others. And ſo much for theſe three men.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He was libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and kinde to <hi>Abraham</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. He was juſt and true in his word.</p>
               </note> he ſalutes <hi>Abraham</hi> with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and courteous language, ſaying, <hi>my Lord heare mee,</hi> and againe, <hi>my Lord heare mee.</hi> Secondly, he was liberall and kinde to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and offered freely to give him the Cave in which he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bury <hi>Sarah.</hi> Thirdly, he was juſt and true in his word, he told <hi>Abraham</hi> a due and right price, and made him good and full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, when hee received the money. The Holy Ghoſt hath not for nothing inſerted theſe ſtories of Scripture, the vertuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment even of Heathens courteſie, bounty, and juſtice be ſweet vertues, they commend the practiſer of them to the conſciences of men, they adorne him with reall honour, and make him to finde both love and praiſe from all hearts and mouthes. They be winning vertues, and give a man a kinde of command in the hearts of wiſe men, eſpecially they become men of good place and ability, for
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:27208:110"/>
ſuch an one was <hi>Ephron,</hi> and make him more gratious then without them the greateſt eſtate could. They are generous ornaments and ſet forth a man more then any gallantneſſe of a tire or houſe-roome. I beſeech you fall in love with them, and put them in continuall practiſe, deale in courteous faſhion with all, be ready to give free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deale juſtly in asking price and making aſſurances. Why ſhould a man yeeld himſelfe to a ſterne and curriſh kinde of ſpeech? Why ſhould he be ſowre in his carriage, niggardly and pinching in his converſation, and unjuſt and over-reaching in his bargaines? Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth us that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth of wearing long haire, <hi>that it is a ſhame to him that doth it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.14, 15.</note> and that the contrary is as it is affirmed, <hi>that long haire is to a woman a glory unto her.</hi> Doe not that which muſt needs be reproachfull, neglect not that which muſt needs be gracefull. Be kinde one to another, be bountifull, be righteous, ſhew that neither ſelfe-love nor the love of money doth poſſeſſe you, the former of which cauſeth auſtereneſſe of carriage, the latter niggardlineſſe and unjuſt dealing. Preſſe your ſelves to theſe vertues and ſay, ſhall not religion make mee more vertuous, then Heatheniſme made this <hi>Hittite?</hi> ſhall I be leſſe affable, bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, righteous to my brethren and neighbours, then a ſtranger of another nation and another religion was to <hi>Abraham</hi> who did but ſojourne neere him? We are ill Schollers in the Schoole of our bleſſed Saviour, if we receive not better inſtructions from him, then can be found in an Heathen teacher; yea we Chriſtians muſt practiſe the ſame vertues in a better manner, on better grounds and to better ends. We muſt be courteous, and for conſcience ſake, not barely for credit, to pleaſe God, not alone to winne men, and to thoſe that wrong us and deale frowardly with us, not alone to them that are courteous unto us. Theſe vertues ſimply in themſelves cannot intitle us to the name of members of Chriſt, unleſſe wee doe them with reference to Gods Commandement and authority, but being ſo as it were dipt in true religion, they will become Seales of our faith and cauſe unto us an ample recompence.</p>
            <p>So I ſhould have ſaid of the former vertues commended in the three fore-named Brethren, of being friends to the righteous, not ſo much for righteouſneſſe ſake as for other commendable parts, wee ſee in them, or for the hope wee may have to be advantaged by them. This will not approove a man to be a true Chriſtian, but to love a righteous man in the name of a righteous, an <hi>Abraham</hi> becauſe he is an <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſervant to the moſt high God, this is a due ſigne of one ſanctified. But I have digreſſed and now returne againe to my Exhortation; I pray you out-ſtrip the Heathen in all vertues and let your converſing amongſt your neighbours be as faire and winning as that of theirs could be. So for theſe men.</p>

                  <p>His faults.</p>

               </note> and overſlaviſh to a beautifull face, for he quickly hearkned to his ſervants that commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Sarahs</hi> faireneſſe to him, and tooke her into his houſe: what a vanity and folly and exceſſive ingagement to luſtfull pleaſures is this in a man? that he can no ſooner heare of a faire woman, but he muſt covet and take her to him. It is an impotency very incident to mans nature, to be too much led with a faire face, with the mixture of the two colours white and red, and the comely proportion of the face. The ſence of ſeeing over-beares them, and they ſcarce looke to any thing ſo much in a woman, as that which <hi>Salomons</hi> experience made him call vanity and deceitfulneſſe, favour and beauty. We that have greater helpes to mortification, ſhould not ſuffer our paſſions to be ſo farre maſters over us. Surely <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Courtiers were well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his inclination in that kind, they would not elſe have brought him ſo quicke tidings of <hi>Sarahs</hi> good face. It is a blame-worthy weakeneſſe in a Heathen, much more in a Chriſtian, to make uſe of the meanes which God hath given him to mortify ſuch paſſions, and let reaſon have dominion over you, rather then eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and fancy. If <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had knowne her to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, it may ſeeme, he would not have taken her from him for all her beauty, and be none of you worſe then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> pretended hee would have beene, to let beauty winne you to be adulterers, corrupters of thoſe you know to be other mens wives. Let not your dotage upon a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſage, make you ruſh into ſo foule a crime as adultery. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>deſire not her beauty to thy hurt,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Further it was a fault in him,<note place="margin">2. He carried himſelfe over-churliſhly to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </note> that he carried himſelfe over churliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in a kind of revengefull paſſion and chiding of him, for calling her ſiſter and not wife, and ſo hazarding him to adultery, and in that paſſion ſending him packing out of his countrey. In anger and diſpleaſure to take a man up for a fault, and drive him away, make him be gone, is ſurely too great an yeelding to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, which receiving of injuries doth worke, even a kind of heate and unlovingneſſe againſt the doer of them. Take you heed of giving your ſelves ſo farre over to wrath. That he did reprove <hi>Abraham</hi> was well, that hee did it over angerly and ſo diſpatched him out of his countrey, this was not well. Shunne what was evill in him, and if you follow any thing, follow that was good.</p>
            <p>And now take you notice of what was good in him.<note place="margin">
                  <p>His vertues.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He diſmiſſed <hi>Sarah</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when hee knew her to be married.</p>
               </note> Firſt ſo ſoone as he perceiveth that God had puniſhed him for taking <hi>Sarah,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſhe was a married wife, hee preſently diſmiſſeth her, ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himſelfe to Gods hand, and not hardening his heart againſt ſtripes. O how happy ſhould we be? if wee could ſpeedily obſerve Gods corrections, and finding out the cauſe by diligent inquiry, rid our handes and houſes inſtantly of thoſe offences which are matter of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:27208:111"/>
provocation to him. How many miſeries might wee eſcape by ſo ſpeedy an obſervation of Gods hand and purpoſe, and a ready yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to him. Pray we to God to give us ſuch a quicke ſight, ſuch a ſtooping diſpoſition. He that gave it to an Heathen man, will much more give it to a Chriſtian. And if any of you have beene ſtoute againſt God <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like, let him abhorre himſelfe that hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leſſe piety then this <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did. It is a proofe of ſome ſoftneſſe of heart, to be driven from ſin even by great plagues.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. He uſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> kindly for <hi>Sarahs</hi> ſake.</note>Another vertue in him was, that he uſed <hi>Abraham</hi> kindly for his ſiſters ſake, ſo was ſhe reputed then, and by that meanes he grew in riches abundantly. Favourable dealing with a man for his friends ſake, eſpecially for a faire ſiſter, a kinſwomans ſake, is a kinde of baſtard curteſie, and may befall a man given to luſt, yea many times the kindneſſe of ſuch is more wonne by ſuch a motive, then by any better deſervings. Let us doe the ſame thing, but on better grounds, let the beauty of vertue make us eſteeme and countenance thoſe that ſhew it, more then a beautifull Siſter or Kinſwoman: but better be loving to a good man even upon ſuch a ſiniſter reſpect, then not at all to be courteous to him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. He lets <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>braham</hi> depart without offe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ury to him.</note>Another thing wherein this man dealed well, was that he dealt not over harſhly with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but lets him goe without offering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury unto him in anything hee had. He doth not take his life from him as <hi>Abraham</hi> feared he would have done, nay nor his ſervants, nor his goods, nor any part of them; but takes order for his ſafe paſſage and conduct out of his Countrey. Let us at leaſt ſo moderate our anger, that if it draw us to a little unkindneſſe and ſoureneſſe of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which is one degree of revenge, yet it may not cauſe us to leape over the pale of juſtice, and to uſe unrighteouſneſſe and cruelty againſt thoſe from whom we have received injury So <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not ſo farre tranſported with anger, though perhaps he might have beene able to have done it, and it may ſeeme at firſt ſight that he had cauſe of doing ſo. But it ſeemeth that the ſence of Gods great plagues had made him begin to ſee, that God was a deare friend of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and that he ſhould have incurred further wrath for wronging him in other things wittily, whoſe injuries God did proſecure ſo ſeverely, even when it was done ignorantly and unwittingly. We ought to have more feare of God before us, then any King of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Deale juſtly therefore, let men goe from us with all they have, make not bold to wreake your teeme on any man, by ſending him away without his owne.</p>
            <p>But it is to be noted, that God plagued <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for his doing hurt to <hi>Abraham</hi> though beyond his knowledge, even with great plagues, you ſee that ſometimes unwitting ſinnes make God very angry with men, when done againſt his deare and faithfull ſervants, in things neere and deare unto them, for he is a Father to them and full of compaſſion, and pittieth their caſe when they ſigh and mourne before him, O with how much heavier evills will he plague them who wittingly and of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:27208:111"/>
ſet purpoſe doe wrong them. How ſhall his anger burne againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and wilfull ſinners? when ſuch heate ariſeth upon occaſion of ſinnes of meere ignorance. Take you heed of cauſing his wrath to ariſe againſt you for ſuch crimes, ſure his ſword will cut of for ſuch faultes, if it wound and cut deepe for the farre leſſer.</p>
            <p>And againe, ſee that even plagues ſometimes are ſent to doe a man more good then hurt, even to keepe a man from ſuch ſinnes, as but for them he would have committed, and to make him ſee and leave thoſe which he did live in before and not obſerve. It was a benefit to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that he was ſo ſcourged, I conceive that this <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not a man ſanctified, for then God would have warned him by dreame or ſome other way, as hee did <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>melech,</hi> rather then by ſeverity of plagues; but it is a kind of favour to any man to be kept from ſin, even by heavy plagues.</p>
            <p>Surely the Lord will doe as much for his owne people, as for the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> rather drive them out of their ſins by ſharpneſſe of blowes, then that they ſhall live and die in them and periſh. Happy is that ſmart or paine that prevents a greater hurt. The Lord had rather his people ſhould ſuffer any thing, then continue in ſinne to their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their outward fame troubles him not ſo much as their inward wickedneſſe. Therefore if you find by experience that Gods hand hath reſtrained you from much evill, and your owne ſoules can ſay, ſuch and ſuch a ſin I ſhould never have ſeene, never have left, if God had not by his ſcourges and blowes even forced me to open mine eyes, and ſee them, and to caſt them away even as it were againſt my will; be you thankfull to God for ſuch chaſtiſements, learne to ſay as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, It was good for me that I was afflicted,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.71.</note> that I might learne thy righteous judgements.</hi> Will not men pay well for a plaiſter that hath a vertue to cure the ſore? though it put the member to ſmarting paine. Surely he doth not hate ſin according to its hatefulneſſe, that hath not learned to be glad of any affliction which keepeth him from ſin, or drawes him out of it. And now if any of you doe lie under heavy plagues, let him become an humble ſuiter to God, to vouchſafe him as much goodneſſe as he pleaſed to grant unto this <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> even to ſhew him the cauſe for which he ſmiteth, and to give him notice of his faults and power to reforme them, we might haſten our deliverance out of calamities, if we would turne them to this purpoſe.

This verily muſt needes be a ſinne, for God did not appoint the ſociety of man and man for pleaſures ſake, that a man might ſeeke to ſatisfie himſelfe in the delight of imbracing ſo many faire women as he could get, but for the increaſe of, and ſtoring of the world with people.

He ſpeedily and readily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed God.</note>It is a worthy vertue and a proofe of integrity, ſpeedily and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to obey the word of God, and amend thoſe ſinnes which before we did not know, when once the Lord doth vouchſafe to make them knowne unto us. This proveth that the ſoule is uprightly deſirous to avoid all ſinnes, when it will inſtantly reforme the fault once mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted. To linger and put of from time to time, and ſtrive to make ones ſelfe blinde, and to winke and not ſee the ſinne, or not addreſſe to a ſpeedy reformation, that is a fruit of guilefulneſſe, but to yeeld to God and ones conſcience, and without further delayes to leave of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:27208:113"/>
the ſinne and put it away and the occaſions of it, that is a proofe of ſincerity at leaſt in that particular. When God declareth a fault to us, bids us mend, promiſeth life if we doe mend, threatens death if we will not reforme; if we beleeve his promiſes and threats, and ſubmit to his Commandements, we ſhew integrity, <hi>Abimelechs</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample muſt teach us this effect of uprightneſſe.</p>
            <p>If any of us be guilty of the contrary fruit of hollowneſſe, that we have neglected to acknowledge a fault beginning to be revealed to us, and out of love to the ſinne in reſpect of any profit, credit, pleaſure it flattered us withall, have rather indeavoured to ſhut out the light by falſe reaſonings, then to receive the knowledge of the truth when it began to ſhine out of the cloud of ignorance, wee muſt greatly blame our ſelves for ſuch hypocriticall behaviour. This is that S. <hi>Paul</hi> accuſeth the Gentiles of, ſaying, that <hi>Gods wrath is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſſe and unrighteouſneſſe of men who detaine the truth in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> who doe as it were impriſon and ſuppreſſe truth and hold it downe, that it may not ſhew it ſelfe unto them, out of a love they beare to ſinne and wickedneſſe. And ſure Gods wrath ſhall appeare evidently againſt all that in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall play the diſſemblers with him; how much more then, if when a man cannot ſo darken himſelfe with fained pretences, but that he muſt needs ſee and confeſſe the truth in his conſcience, ſhall he be guilty of a great ſinne, if ſtill he uphold in himſelfe a will and reſolution to commit the ſinne, that he could not but ſee to be a ſinne, or if he doe not come to a preſent reſolution of amendment, but put it off till afterwards and purpoſe to continue offending once or twice or a little time longer. Shall not <hi>Abimelechs</hi> example condemne our diſobedience before God, if we ſhew our ſelves ſo much inthralled to ſin?</p>
            <p>Two things ſhew dominion of ſinne in a man, one where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth to know though he have due meanes of knowledge, and a certaine working of knowledge offering to convince his conſcience, another, when though he doe know, yet he reſolves to perſiſt in all evill, or at leaſt remaines irreſolute and doth not determine to leave, but ſtands as it were unſetled in his will at leaſt for ſome time. If any of you finde himſelfe ſo diſpoſed, it is certaine, that ſinne ruleth in him and he is not under grace. Wherefore you muſt diligently proove your hearts in this reſpect, if you deſire ever to enjoy the comfort of knowing your ſelves to be upright. Now then learne to lend a dutifull eare to the Word of God, and ſee the ſinnes that it beginnes to ſhew you, and put on a full and ſetled reſolution of not adventuring to commit them any more. And if any finde himſelfe ſo ſubdued to the authority of God in all things, that he ſeeme rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to entertaine the light of truth and to obey it, and will not ſtruggle and ſtrive againſt the light in any thing, then may he aſſure himſelfe, that his heart is true within him, and that the Lord will ſurely accept him and forgive his unpurpoſed offences and ſinnes of meere weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:27208:114"/>
and frailty. Indeed in ſome one or two things that are too too groſſe as adultery here, a man may be prepared to yeeld to truth, and yet not have an honeſt heart to God, but he that in all things doth thus ſubmit himſelfe, is ſurely good before the Lord. And ſo much for <hi>Abimelechs</hi> obedience to God, in that he receiveth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements here with faith and preſent obedience, which wee ſhall alſo doe, if we ſeriouſly conſider his promiſes of life to the obedient and threatenings of death to the diſobedient, till we worke our hearts to a firme and ſtedfaſt beleefe of them.</p>

               <note place="margin">2. He acquaints his ſervants with Gods pleaſure.</note>Now another good deed of <hi>Abimelech</hi> is in regard of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. As ſoone as it is day he calls them together, and acquaints them with the things that God had revealed unto him by a dreame in the night. He doth well to let his ſervants know the matter, that ſo he might make them ſee the true cauſe of his reſtoring <hi>Sarah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and might approove of his practiſe therein, and learne themſelves to feare God which at leaſt in ſome degree they did, for it is ſaid, <hi>the men feared exceedingly, verſe</hi> 8. and ſo did not perſwade him to keepe <hi>Sarah</hi> ſtill, but rather furthered his intentions of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. All governours muſt be ready to acquaint their inferiours with the way that God ſhewes them, eſpecially ſuch as concerne the reformation of the lives both of themſelves and of their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, for it was needfull that <hi>Abimelechs</hi> ſervants ſhould know, that <hi>Sarah</hi> was <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, leaſt they or ſome one of them ſhould thinke of taking her, when the King had left her, if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ignorant of her condition. Rulers therefore muſt ſhew unto their inferiours the danger of ſinne and what is ſinnefull when the Lord hath made them know it, that they may be an inſtrument of keeping them alſo from evill deeds and from the puniſhment of them. Learne we all of this man to tender the ſoules of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and inferiours, and to reveale to them ſuch things as God hath taught us, that they may be preſerved from ſinne as well as our ſelves. And take heed of being careleſſe to ſhew them the good and the evill way, that they ſinne not through our default, becauſe we have not duly inſtructed them. And let inferiours alſo learne to receive ſuch inſtructions with holy feare as the ſervants of <hi>Abimelech</hi> did, that the words they heare may prevaile to keepe them alſo from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>

So, it is a good thing if our Brethren have ſinned againſt us, to call for them or goe to them, and to demand what ground they had or what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:27208:114"/>
to ſinne ſo, and to let them underſtand, that the things they have done were ſuch as ought not to have beene done, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they have gone about to draw us to ſinne, or to occaſion us to ruſh unwittingly into ſinne, that ſo wee may bring them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or at leaſt free our ſelves from being partakers with them in their ſinnes. So did he deale with <hi>Sarah</hi> too, but not with the like earneſtneſſe, for he conſidered the fault was chiefely <hi>Abrahams,</hi> who had confeſſed that ſhe did it at his entreaty, and therefore hee doth alone intimate a chiding to her, ſaying, <hi>thy brother,</hi> and adding good counſell, <hi>He is to thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee, and to all others, verſe</hi> 16. and it is added, <hi>for ſhee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved,</hi> meaning, that hee intended to reproove her, and that ſhee did take it and was touched with it as with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</p>
            <p>Let us reſolve to behave our ſelves ſo to our brethren, even to tell them plainely, but yet gently of their faults, and that with more or leſſe earneſtneſſe, as they ſhall appeare to have beene more or leſſe faulty. Some warmth muſt be in a reproofe as here, but it muſt not be ſcalding hot, words of reviling and diſgrace they ſcald as it were, but words that tend to ſtirre up the conſcience to a due conſideration of the fault, they be duely warme and tend to make the phyſick worke the more kindly. If any have done otherwiſe, either hiding the matter in his heart and ſo nouriſhing bitter diſlike and alienation of affection from one that hath wronged him, or elſe opened his mouth in a kind of rage, and uſed hunting and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſpeeches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he muſt be ſorry that he was not as diſcreet and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as <hi>Abimelech.</hi> To forbeare reproofe of another, or to doe it with bitterneſſe of wrath be too common faults and withall very blame-worthy. The one ſhewes want of love, the other of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and in both we wrong our brother, in not taking the right way to helpe him out of ſinne, and wrong our ſelves in making our ſelves at leaſt in part guilty of his ſinne. Be not you faulty in either of theſe kindes hereafter, but learne in plaine and milde manner to deale with them that have done you injury, and let thoſe that have done wrong learne of <hi>Abraham</hi> duly to accept of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes.</p>
            <p>Another vertue in <hi>Abimelech</hi> is,<note place="margin">4.

It is ſaid, <hi>he tooke ſheepe and oxen and men-ſervants and women-ſervants and gave them to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and reſtored</hi> Sarah <hi>his wife.</hi> See a good duty here, wee muſt not alone ſurceaſe to wrong our brethren for future time, if either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly or otherwiſe wee have begun to doe them wrong, but if the wrong be manifeſt unto them, we muſt even make them ſome due ſatisfaction by words, or deeds, or both, chiefely, if the injury have beene done wittingly and willingly. Thinke not that you have done

enough in forbearing to doe evill to any man, but if the evill have beene evident unto him, O make alſo ſome good amends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the wrong, and to doe him as much good in ſome other kinde as you have done him hurt before. That ſo you may de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clare your ſelves as well ſorry for the former offence, as carefull to offend ſo no more, and may make it appeare you ceaſe to be injurious in part out of love to your brother, as well as for any other conſideration, and may by that meanes make the pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the wrong more eaſie to him, and helpe to put charity and kindneſſe into him, which the receiving of wrongs will goe neare to baniſh away, if ſome ſuch care be not uſed to reſtore it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. But he that either continues in a continues of injuriouſneſſe, or elſe barely breaketh it off without ſome demonſtration of his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the fault and good affection to the perſon offended, hath not yet fully reformed himſelfe though he have ceaſed to doe evill any further.</p>

            <p>It is a good thing to obſerve the goodneſſe of God ſo his people, thereupon to think well of them and to deſire to live in amity and peace

with them. Why ſhould not wee have our eyes open to ſee Gods bleſſing going along with men? and when wee ſee it, why ſhould wee not rather love them and wiſh their friendſhip, then beare an evill eye towards them and maligne them. It is a ſigne of ſome goodneſſe to acknowledge, that God is the Author of all good ſucceſſe to mens affaires, herein wee give him the honour of being the ruler of the world. And it is a ſigne of ſome good will to men, when their proſperous eſtate makes us rather like them and joyne friendſhip with them, then ſtirreth up grudging and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining at them. Surely <hi>Abimelechs</hi> carriage giveth us ſome probable grounds to conceive, that himſelfe was a holy man, in that hee ſhewes ſome knowledge of God, and good affection to ſo good a ſervant of God. Let us goe a little further, and ſtrive to intereſt our ſelves into Gods bleſſing on the godly, by following them in godlineſſe. But let his willing reſtitution of the Well which his ſervants had taken away by violence, teach us alſo not to beare out the ſervants or people that are under our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in any unjuſt carriage of theirs; yea rather, ſo ſoone as wee come to the knowledge of their naughty carriage, let us cauſe them to amend and to repaire the wrongs that they have done. A mans ſervants faults muſt not bee imputed to him, till it bee knowne whether hee be privie to them or not, but if when hee is informed of them, he be careleſſe to ſee them amended, now is himſelfe as guilty of the ſinne as his ſervants were before. Thus you have the faults and vertues of <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſo farre as I could note them out of holy Writ.</p>
            <p>Conſider now what benefits God beſtowed upon him. Firſt,<note place="margin">His benefits.</note> hee made him a King.<note place="margin">1. God made him a King.</note> In thoſe daies it is evident that Kings were not rulers over ſo large dominions as now they be; of old the chiefeſt ruler over one or two Cities and the territories about it was a King, as in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> there were 31 Kings, and the five Cities of the plaine of <hi>Sodome</hi> and the reſt had each of them ſeverall Kings, and yet there were ſome Kings that raigned over whole Countries as the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but in it ſelfe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it is a favour of God to preferre a man unto the honour of a King, as the Scripture prooveth in ſaying,<note place="margin">Pro. 22.29.</note> 
               <hi>a diligent ſervant ſhall ſtand before Kings and not before thoſe of the meaner ſort;</hi> If to be in favour and account with a King, be a thing fit to be promiſed as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of diligence, much more the enjoying of a Kingdome, therefore God upbraides both <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> when he would ſharpely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove their ſins, that he had made them Kings over his people <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for Kings have likely, riches, honour, and authority, by the two former of which they may partake of much comfort themſelves, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate much alſo to their friends and kindred, by the latter they may bring much honour to God, and much good alſo to men in eſtabliſhing true religion and juſtice: Now God hath not pleaſed to make any of you Kings, but he hath made ſome of you richer and greater then

others, as I may ſay little petty Kings in your places. Beware you pervert not this goodneſſe of God, by making your wealth and power a meanes of ſwelling your hearts with pride, and imboldening you to wrong and oppreſſe others, and furniſhing you with inſtruments to ſerve your owne luſts, for the ſuch abuſe of theſe benefits will turne them into poyſon, as it were to your ſoules, and cauſe that they ſhall ſerve at length for the ſame purpoſe which S.<note place="margin">James 5.3.</note>

Labour to bee Kings over your ſelves, in eſtabliſhing the Kingdome of grace in your hearts, that you may bee Kings hereafter, and that in farre greater glory and happineſſe, then the greateſt of all earthly Kings either did ever or ever could enjoy: the meaneſt Chriſtian may get the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace and of glory, as well as a <hi>David</hi> or a <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>

But the favour affoorded him is this, he was taught of God his duty by a dreame; Dreames were one of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances whereby God did reveale his will unto men in thoſe times: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was ſhewed a thing in a dreame, and ſo was <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> but God did not appeare unto them and ſpeake to them in dreames, this was an ordinance of his I ſay, in which moſt times hee uſed to teach good men. Now this was a note of Gods kindneſſe to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> that hee ſo taught him and not by heavy plagues, as hee did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. How much more mercy ſhewes the Lord to us, to whom hee ſhewes himſelfe in the word, and in the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of it, whereby wee are taught our damnable eſtate, and ſhewed the meanes of eſcaping it, and called upon with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall threats and promiſes to uſe thoſe meanes, let us pray to God to worke upon us by theſe his ordinances, that they may winne us to obedience in a thorough reformation of life, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> was wonne to reform e this one fault, and then happy ſhall wee bee.

This is a great favour of God, to make haſt to our deliverance, and very quickly to heare our owne prayers, and the prayers of others made for us, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to remove the miſeries which did lie upon us; for if the long lying on of a croſſe bee tedious and heavy, becauſe of the much ſorrow it bringeth, and many complaints it wringeth from the mouth even of good men, ſaying, <hi>Lord how long?</hi> then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freedome from all that anguiſh muſt bee received as a point of great grace.

            <p>Somewhat about that time, there lived foure Kings, whoſe names are recorded in holy Writ, but nothing at all for their praiſe. Their names were, 1. <hi>Amraphel</hi> King of <hi>Shinar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Foure Kings.</note> that is, as it is thought, of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> or <hi>Babilon,</hi> where it may ſeeme that <hi>Nimrod</hi> erected a Monarchie, and it may bee that this man was ſome ſucceſſor of his or one of his Poſterity, and would needes inlarge his Monarchie ſo farre as the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with whom was joyned <hi>Amoch</hi> King of <hi>Elkaſar, Chedarlomer</hi> King of <hi>Elam,</hi> and one <hi>Tydall</hi> King of <hi>Nations.</hi> What theſe Kings were? or whether mentioned in Heathen Stories or not,<note place="margin">They were violent.</note> it matters not to enquire. But here they are patternes of unjuſt violence in Warre. They had the keener ſwords and therefore would make themſelves Lords over other Kings, and compell them by brunt of Warre to receive their yoke and acknowledge ſome Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. Nothing more uſuall then for potent Kings to make at leaſt unneceſſary Warres for their growth in greatneſſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they doe not ſo much as alleadge a ſhew of title, but their owne ambition is the ground of their plea, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they pretend moſt frivolous titles.

            <p>Wee muſt bleſſe God that hath cauſed us to live now a good time under peaceable Princes, and muſt inforce our prayers to God begging the like mercy ſtill. The Conquering ſide is often more miſerable by ſinning, then the conquered by ſlaughter or captivity. But God doth uſe theſe great Cockes of the game as inſtruments of his Juſtice, to puniſh the naughtineſſe of thoſe that abuſe peace, and become more wicked by ſo great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. Let us learne to take heede of wickedneſſe, that the God of Heaven may not alſo make us a prey to violence and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And though you bee not Kings, to whom I ſpeake, yet I pray you take heed that you runne not into the ſame fault,

It often falleth out, that one act of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice looſeth much that otherwiſe was juſtly gotten. Beware of ſwallowing ill gotten wealth, it hath a poyſonfull operation, and like ſome ſuch evill ſimple in the ſtomacke, will bring up the good foode together with ill humours: It is ſaid the King of <hi>Sodome</hi> had rebelled, ſo intimating a kinde of juſtification of the Warre with him, but it is not ſaid that <hi>Lot</hi> had rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and therefore they ſhould not have ſeized on him for the <hi>Sodomites</hi> ſake.

               <note place="margin">Their faults in generall.</note>But for their faults and vices they be many and great. The Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh of them in generall and more particularly. Firſt in generall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.13. that they were <hi>wicked and ſinners before the Lord exceedingly,</hi> and <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.20. <hi>The cry of Sodome and Gomorrah is great and their ſinne is very grievous.</hi> Loe you may ſee in them, that the wicked nature of man is apt to become out of meaſure ſinfull, and to bring forth exceeding grievous ſinnes, and ſuch as make a mighty cry in the eares of God, even as it were wearying his patience and challenging his juſtice for revenge. As a thing beginning to rot becomes exceeding rotten, even till it come to be very filth and dirt, and a man beginning to tumble downe the hill, makes no ſtop till he come to the very bottome of the hill. For both Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is offended and provoked to puniſh them for a preſumptuous and wilfull ſinne, by giving them over to their owne blindneſſe and hardneſſe, and to Satans power and temptations, and alſo Satan is earneſt to thruſt ſinners forward in the pathes of iniquity, that if it were poſſible, hee might ſatisfie his hatred againſt mankinde, by making them all as bad as himſelfe, and alſo corrupt nature it ſelfe finding pleaſure, delight, and content in ſinne, is made more and more prone to ſinne, and ſo proceedeth further and further, till the Lord ſhall ſtrip them by oppoſing of his juſt vengeance, and cutting them off in the midſt of their wilde race.</p>
            <p>Learne we therefore to take heed of the beginnings of evill, and to licenſe our ſelves to commit any ſinne out of a conceit that it is ſmall and little, or yet becauſe wee meane to doe it but once, and then an end, for ſinne once committed will quickly returne to tempt us againe, and will more eaſily prevaile to breake forth the ſecond time then the firſt, and the third then the ſecond and ſo forward. 'Tis not in a falling mans choice and power to ſtop himſelfe when himſelfe pleaſeth, nor in one that is ſinking in deepe waters to ſtay himſelfe from ſinking to the very bottome. And a little ſinne doth but make way for a greater till at length there be ſpace enough for the greateſt of all to enter, yea harder it will be to abſtaine from the fowleſt and moſt grievous at the laſt, then from the very leaſt of all at the firſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not therefore to ſinne out of any ſuch conceit.</p>
            <p>Againe, if wee have ſinned in ſmaller degrees of evill, or once or twice done amiſſe, let us make haſt to repent and turne, humbling our ſelves and craving power and helpe againſt our owne naughtineſſe, otherwiſe it is certaine, that extremity of the moſt horrible wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes will grow upon us, and wee ſhall become like them of <hi>Sodome,</hi> grievous ſinners, and exceeding wicked before the Lord, and our ſins alſo will grow ſo rooring, as to waken the Lord out of his ſlumber of patience and forbearance, yea and if God have ſtopped us in the paths of ſinne, and not left us to the higheſt degree of wickedneſſe, we muſt acknowledge his goodneſſe in keeping us from ſuch exceſſe of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, and beware of boaſting our ſelves becauſe wee are not ſtarke naught; for did not a divine power reſtraine and bridle corruption, and

hold it downe as it were by ſtrong hand, there is no man in the work ſo civill and ſo moderate, but he would breake forth into the greateſt exorbitancy of wickedneſſe, as the leaſt coale of fire if it be nouriſhed with fewell and incited with blowing, will undoubtedly breake forth into a conſuming flame within a little ſpace of time.

               </note> next as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth afterwards taxe them by way of upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Iſrael</hi> with the ſame abhominations. The firſt ſinne noted in the <hi>Sodomites</hi> is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.4. that having ſerved the King of <hi>Shinar</hi> twelve yeares, in the 14 they rebelled. Thoſe that have beene ſubdued by another Prince, and received the yoke of ſubjection at length, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting Homage and obedience (as in ſuch caſe they alwaies doe to redeeme their lives by their ſervice) upon ſuch and ſuch conditions, made betwixt the conquerour and conquered, are very weary of the yoke for the moſt part, and watch all advantages of making themſelves free againe by rebellion, whenſoever they thinke themſelves ſtrong enough to juſtifie and beare out their rebellions: but without doubt, this courſe is ſinfull and unlawfull, becauſe it is a manifeſt breach of an oath and covenant, which ought to be firmely kept amongſt men even though a mans covenants be made to his owne diſadvantage. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the Lord greatly diſpleaſed with <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the laſt of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> race I thinke, that ſate on the throne of <hi>David,</hi> becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt the King of <hi>Babell Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the land and made himſelfe King over it, for ſo ſaith <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>He rebelled againſt the King of Babel in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Ambaſſadours to Egypt, ſhall he eſcape that doth ſuch things?</hi> or <hi>ſhall he breake the covenant and bee delivered? as I live ſaith the Lord God, ſurely in the place whoſe oath hee deſpiſed and whoſe covenant hee brake, he ſhalld die,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Seeing he deſpiſed the oath by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Covenant when he had given his hand and hath done all theſe things, hee ſhall not eſcape.</hi> The Lord you ſee is offended with ſuch a kinde of rebellion and puniſheth it, becauſe it is as you ſee a deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of an oath and breach of a covenant. For indeed this is the way to trouble the world and make warres everlaſting: though it be a fault in a neighbour Prince without juſt cauſe and ground, to make Warre and conquer his bordering neighbours and bring them under his yoke; yet when God by his providence hath made him conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the weakeneſſe of the conquered hath drawne them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and now covenants and agreements of peace have beene concluded upon, the breaking of the covenants doth violate the rules of truth and faithfullneſſe amongſt men, and breeds new troubles and broyles there, where might have beene much peace and proſperity if they would have beene contented to have borne the yoke; as <hi>Ieremy</hi>

            <p>This therefore muſt cauſe us to deteſt much more, as a much more plaine and fearefull crime, the ſinne of rebellion, againſt thoſe more rightfull Kings and Princes, to whom we owe more ſubjection, as being both naturall borne ſubjects, and alſo having tyed our ſelves by an oath of allegiance and loyalty, for the more confirming of us in our duty, and ſtronger tying our conſciences to it. And the Pope that taketh upon him (for his owne advantage you may be ſure) to diſſolve and unlooſe ſuch oathes, diſpencing with them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to free mens conſciences from the obligation of them, and from all danger of ſinne by breaking them, carrieth himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wickedly, and is moſt extreamely injurious to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, and to the peace of the world, and moſt impudently bolde againſt the name of God, and the ſacred and inviolable power of an oath. Bee you advertiſed, that this is to ſet himſelfe above God, in undertaking to diſpence with an oath taken by the holy name of God, which the Lord himſelfe did never yet diſpence withall, for hee that diſpenceth with the conſcience, muſt be Lord of the conſcience, and hee that diſſolveth an oath, muſt be greater then he that bindeth to the oath, and by the oath, and that is the living God alone, whoſe Name is invocated in an oath. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abhorre you this man of ſinnes impious boldneſſe, and learne alſo to abhorre all manner of rebellion, learning of <hi>Salomon,</hi> not to meddle with the ſeditious,<note place="margin">Prov. 24.21.</note> but to feare God and honour the King, and ſhew all good fidelity and allegiance unto him for conſcience.

The crime of Sodomitrie it ſelfe.</note>The crime it ſelfe is that baſe and vile, and worſe then brutiſh wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, of confounding the ſexes which God hath in the creation diſtinguiſhed. For he made the Male and Female, but theſe beaſts would needes ſo much as was in them, take away that ſo neceſſary and uſefull deſtinction, and would have abuſed Males as if they had beene Females, and turned men into women for the ſatisfaction of their prodigious luſt, and that not out of a kind of forced neceſſity, becauſe in the boyling of their unruly appetite there was not a woman to be had, but meerely out of the ſinnefulneſſe of their deſires, which made them take more delight in that which was againſt nature, and leaving the naturall ſociety of the woman, they flamed in their luſts towards man-kind, and as they had no queſtion wrought villanie one with another, ſo now they would have violently committed the ſame outrage upon others. This is an horrible ſinne, forbidden by God in the Law under paine of death, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.13. the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>that abuſers of themſelves with man-kinde, ſhall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the kingdome of God.</hi> If there be any light of nature left in a mans minde, he cannot but ſee the wickedneſſe of this fact; for ſeeing the Lord ordeined the conjuction of man and woman, for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopling of the world and multiplication of man-kind, it cannot but be againſt nature altogether to power out luſt in ſuch a foule faſhion, as that it becommeth utterly impoſſible to attaine the proper end of ſuch meeting, wherefore they are carried brutiſhly after ſenſuall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with averſeneſſe from the fruit that God and nature intend, which doe give themſelves over to this filthineſſe. This is the crime of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domitry,</hi> ſo entitled from theſe Monſters of men that were the firſt publike committers of it. But how ordinary it was in <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> among both Latine and Grecian even Philoſophers and men accounted worthy and excellent? the Stories will not ſuffer us to be ignorant. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes, that the Lord of purpoſe to avenge himſelfe upon their impiety, in not finding out his true worſhip, <hi>but changing the Image of the incorruptible God into an image made like <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <hi>and worſhipping the creature beſides the Creator, did give them up unto uncleaneneſſe in their owne hearts luſts, to diſhonour their bodies amongſt themſelves, and thoſe that changed the truth of God,</hi> that truth which concerned God and the knowledge of him, <hi>into a lie,</hi> and ſet up images of him, did after put out the light of nature into darkneſſe, and the naturall uſe into that which was againſt nature.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:27208:122"/>
Now how ſhould it come to paſſe, that any one indued with reaſon ſhould grow ſo utterly unreaſonable, as to preferre this filthineſſe before that which is agreeable to the courſe of nature? Surely becauſe when luſt hath once taken poſſeſſion of a man, and that he doth not finde his expected ſatisfaction therein, then the Divell inflameth his fancies to try new and ſtrange wayes of contenting himſelfe, untill he have multiplied his ſinnefull inventions to the utmoſt, and ſpent himſelfe in a fruitleſſe purſuing of what he cannot overtake.</p>
            <p>Now conſider the ſeverall aggravations of their ſinne, Firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <p n="2">2. The aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of this ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the perſons to whom they would have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany.</p>
               </note> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the perſons to whom they intended to offer this villanie, even men that came within their gates to lodge and ſeeke ſhelter from wrongs. Had they not filthy perſons enough among themſelves to pleaſe their libidinous fancies withall? but they muſt force honeſt and vertuous men to ſuffer ſuch an indignity. Luſt is ever the more blameworthy in exerciſing it ſelfe, by how much it uſeth more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to effect its deſire. It prevaileth by force worſe then by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, although wickedly enough either way, for here is a double wrong done to the ſame perſon, one of polluting, another forcing to ſuffer. Abhorre you all manner of impurities, but eſpecially loath to give luſt ſuch an headſtrong command over you, that it ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell you by force and ſtrength to compell others to ſuffer your unchaſt offers. And if any man hath by wreſtling, and ſtriving, and might even overcome a reſiſting perſon, let him bewaile the ſinne the more, becauſe it is the greater, elſe the Lord will violently puniſh him, that violently abuſed another.</p>
            <p>Againe beware of offering hard meaſure to a ſtranger, the more helpleſſe any man is, the more charity commandeth to pity him, the leſſe to wrong him: eſpecially to be ſo madded with luſt, as that a man ſhould impure one with filthy aſſayes whom he never ſaw before, this is to ſhew a moſt licentious and unſatisfiable humour, that is not contented, unleſſe beaſt-like, it may have any it ſees at any time. That luſt will know no bounds which is carried after every ſtranger, and it is the property of luſt, when it hath overlaſhed more then it ought, to disdaine all bounds and limits. Perhaps theſe Angels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the forme of very beautifull young men, and that might cauſe the filthy <hi>Sodomites</hi> to caſt libidinous lookes upon them, but howſoever it was, luſt doth not confine it ſelfe alwayes to beauty, it is of a raunging humour and loveth variety, and might it have all in the world but one, it would not be pleaſed without that one alſo, as other deſires in their kindes are infinite and inſatiable.</p>
            <p>Another aggravation of their wickedneſſe,<note place="margin">2. In reſpect of the perſons that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.</note> is from the perſons that committed it, not one vile fellow, or three or foure companions in villany, conſented together to act ſuch a hideous part, but all the men of the city, ould and young, all from every quarter aſſembled together, by which it is manifeſt, that the City was univerſally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and that there was not a civill honeſt man left amongſt them,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:27208:123"/>
but all were turned abhominable buggerers, and did take pleaſure either to act that filthineſſe themſelves or to ſee it acted by others. It is a fearefull thing, when ſuch grievous crimes grow common, when all commit them or like of them, none reproveth, none op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth them, but every one makes another worſe then he would be, and no man will thinke that wicked, which is done by each man in the towne or countrey, as well as by himſelfe. Men follow ſinne amaine, when they ſwimme downe the ſtreame of example unto it; they make themſelves bold to doe what all doe, and can hardly make themſelves beleeve they offend in going with the heard as it it were, O let us reſiſt the overgrowing of ſinne, the overſpreading of all, that it be not as a ſpreading fretting leproſie: Seldome is it, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous ſinnes grow common, but that ſome common vengeance fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, and yet you ſee the nature even of the worſt ſinnes to be ſuch, that they will ſpread themſelves by little and become univerſall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, and when every man hath them, none knowes how to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, or careth to cure them.</p>
            <p>But ſee here the old decrepit goates, that were now ſcarce able to ſee or heare or wag abroad, yet theſe had as luſtfull mindes as the youngeſt there, and what they could not act becauſe of weakeneſſe, yet the ſtrength of their unmortified luſts did make them delight to behold, and attempt to performe ſo farre as they could. It is not age that will quench luſt, this fault ſtriketh in the fancy and will not be cured by bodily inabilities, they can love to ſpeake wantonly, and to attempt this worſt of evill, that yet are impotent through age. But ah, it is a moſt undecent thing to ſee the ſinnes of youth prevailing in times of age, it were monſtrous to behold greene apples on a tree in winter. If the froſt of age cannot nip the bloſſomes of libidinous deſires, how great was that heate! who can thinke that he is at all mortified in other things, where nature affordeth leſſe helpe, that hath not prevailed againſt the things that ſhould even die of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But it is ſure, that length of time will not conquer his hatefull paſſion, unleſſe grace be granted from above, the elder adulterer is the moſt neighing, he deſireth ſo much the more, by how much he can effect leſſe, as you ſee it in ſome kind of creatures whom the knife hath cauſed to ceaſe to be perfect males. O if any old man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you have a wanton heart, head, hand, tongue, and gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to pleaſe himſelfe with dalliances, and laſcivious geſtures, words and carriages, let him be exceedingly abaſed in himſelfe, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ones ancientneſſe makes the leaſt attempt in him more loathſome, then any act in a young ſtripling, ſo long as one is carried with the fervour of youth to ſuch offences, there is hope that age will temper, but in whom theſe fires continue ſparkling, when his body is little warmer then a dead carkaſſe, what hope can be conceived of his amendment? what charity can thinke that hee will ever bee chaſte? for hee is not chaſte that cannot, but hee that will not be laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:27208:123"/>But ſee here young men as well as old, the Holy Ghoſt nameth not alone men come to the vigour of their youth, but even the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger youths that were ſcarce paſt child-hood, theſe alſo learnt of the elder, and it pleaſed them to be preſent where filthy deedes were done. Verily, child-hood will ſoone receive the infection of luſt and there is ſcarce a ſinne that will ſhew it ſelfe more early in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe evill ſpeeches or actes it heares or ſees; young ones will drinke in this poiſon greedily, and will ſhew that themſelves are of kinne to the elder, by bending the ſame way. How carefull therefore ſhould elder perſons be, to forbeare all ſuch wordes and carriages before theſe buds, as may begin to ſeaſon with evill too too timely? and why ſhould any be ſo naught as yet ſome parents have beene, to delight to teach their childeren libidinous ſongs and carriages? ſome love ſinne ſo well, that they delight to inſtruct young ones in this foule and obſcene trade. Hath any amongſt you ſpate out this venome in the preſence of young ones, to make them ſooner wicked then elſe they would? O how very great is his ſinne, whoſe filthineſſe will live in another when himſelfe is dead. A man hath more cauſe to bewaile the contagion of his luſt in this kinde, then the luſt it ſelfe in himſelfe, he may kill it by repentance, but what will he doe to ſtop the contagion in another.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">3. From the manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</note> the fault is exceedingly aggravated from the manner of doing. Firſt, they carried themſelves moſt impudently in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they ſtucke not to tell their minde plainly, <hi>bring them out to us,</hi> ſay they, and they doe not pretend any honeſt errand, nor will ſo much as goe about the buſh a little to ſhelter their naughtineſſe, till opportunity ſerved to put it in practiſe, but as if it were the moſt honeſt occaſion that might be, they proclaime, <hi>that wee may know them.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt abhorreth turpitude of ſpeech, and therefore delivers their meaning in a modeſt phraſe, but whither they affected any ſuch modeſt vaile of ſpeaking, its greatly queſtionable, at leaſt it is more probable, that thoſe which would declare their mindes ſo openly and ſo loudly, would utter it alſo as broadly, for ſhame is the onely pull-backe to theſe kinde of looſe ſpeeches. Men feare to ſpeake groſſely, becauſe they would not be thought ſo vile as to delight in filthineſſe, and he that would be knowne to intend ſuch a leudneſſe, no queſtion but he would alſo pleaſe himſelfe in the worſt phraſes he could invent.</p>
            <p>Impudency in ſinne, eſpecially in this ſinne againſt which God hath pleaſed to arme corrupt nature with ſome degree of ſhame; for were it not a matter of reproach to offend in this kinde, how few would live chaſtely in their younger and wilder dayes? nay ſcarce in their elder. Mens credit is dearer to them then their ſoule, pleaſure would conquer conſcience in thoſe in whom it cannot conquer vaine-glory: but I ſay impudency in all ſinnes, chiefely in this ſinne, doth make it out of meaſure wicked: <hi>they cannot bluſh,</hi> ſaith the Prophet,<note place="margin">Iſa. 3.9.</note> 
               <hi>they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their ſinne like Sodome, they know not how to be aſhamed when they
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:27208:124"/>
had done evill.</hi> It is a ſigne that a man hath ſtript himſelfe of the nature of a man when he begins not to be aſhamed of ſinne eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not of this ſinne. A beaſt hath not the underſtanding to diſcerne the turpitude of evill, therefore he cannot be aſhamed, ſo the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is turned into a very beaſt, having loſt the ſence of good and evill: ſuch a one, if any, hath gotten to himſelfe that which is called a reprobate minde, a minde that cannot trie or proove things, that can put no difference.</p>
            <p>Therefore learne to preſerve ſhamefaſtneſſe in your ſelves, and to know how to bluſh, it is the colour of vertue in the younger ſort, which ſhould onely therefore be ſeparated from elder perſons, becauſe they ſhould then be more perfect then to ſay or doe things that might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion it, elſe impudencie in vice is the more loathſome by how much the head is grayer; Indeed want of ſtore of bloud will not give ſo red a hue to the cheekes, but if an old man be not more confounded within himſelfe for his wickedneſſe then a younger, it is a ſigne that his age hath profited little in ability of judging, and diſcerning evill from good and good from evill. If any amongſt you finde himſelfe to have a brazen fore-head, that is never a whit abaſhed at the doing of evill, chiefely of wanton deeds, that he cares not much who ſees or knowes, what dirt is harboured in his minde, he is neere neighbour to a <hi>Sodomite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as they did it impudently, ſo moſt wilfully, for when <hi>Lot</hi> by loving dehortations, and (as any but a brutiſh perſon would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) offers of that which might have better contented them, then that which they propounded (even his owne two daughters virgins) yet they grew diſdainefull towards him, ſtand farre of or beyond, the word is, <hi>approach beyond,</hi> as much as in our phraſe, <hi>get thee farther of,</hi> and accuſing him of great inſolencie, that being a ſtranger would needs make himſelfe a Judge, (He takes upon him as a chiefe ruler in the conceit of a wicked man that ſeekes to drive him from his ſinne) they fall to threaten, that they will deale worſe with him then with them. So gentle words did rather exaſperate them, then any thing mitigate their eagerneſſe, therefore the Angels pulling in <hi>Lot</hi> unto them into the houſe, ſtrike the men with blindneſſe, a kinde of gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of braine and dazeling of eyes, like to thoſe that have fed of ſome kinde of roote that makes them little leſſe then wilde and mad for the time, they could not finde the doore by groping, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill to wearie themſelves by groping after it.</p>
            <p>Here is the greateſt obſtinacy and wilfullneſſe in ſinning that could be imagined, when not alone no loving diſſwaſion could withdraw their mindes from ſuch a ſhamefull attempt, but even the heavie and immediate hand of God was unable to pull them backe from conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in their horrible and outragious onſets. God might by force hold them from doing the evill, but from indeavouring to doe it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would hinder; to be ſo hard-hearted in a ſinfull courſe, that neither words nor blowes will ſo much as interrupt a man in his
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:27208:124"/>
naughtineſſe, or cauſe him to turne a little aſide, or make a little ſtop in it, but that he ruſheth like a horſe into the battell, plunging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in it like a madman running to drowne himſelfe, and with violence ſtriving to rid himſelfe of them that ſeeke to hinder him from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his miſchiefe, this may ſeeme as high a degree of ſinning, as that of the <hi>Sodomites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O take heed that ſinne lay not ſo faſt hold upon you, let it not be ſo abſolute and mighty a commander. I pray you examine your ſelves, whether you have not ſinned groſſely, boldly, wilfully, and obſtinately in ſome other kinde, as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> in maſculine luſts, at leaſt whether you have not diſcovered the ſame faults in leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and know that more deepe remorſe and wounding of heart is neceſſary to be ſought after by all men for ſinnes that have ſo many weights at their heeles to make them heavier. They muſt rend our ſoules more, which are laden with ſuch conſiderations, Was not the ſinne groſſe? Yes. Did I not commit it preſumptuouſly? Yes. Did I not commit it ſhameleſly? Yes. Did I not commit it wilfully? Yes. Did I not perſiſt in it againſt dehortaions? Yes. Was I ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious that ſome ſtrong hand of God befalling in the inſtant could not hinder mee? Yes. O then how <hi>Sodomiticall</hi> was this ſinne, and how ſhould I wonder that I ſhould ſo farre ſurpaſſe all bounds and breake all bands as to commit ſuch a crime in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>But here is one fault particularly to be noted in <hi>Lots</hi> ſonnes in Law,<note place="margin">The ſinne of <hi>Lots</hi> ſonnes in Law, they would not be ruled by their Father.</note> their Father ſought to get them out of that place, and ſo out of that plague, and therefore by commiſſion from the Angels, went forth to them, acquainted them with the perill and beſought them to ſave themſelves, they count his words no better then the doating dreames of an old man, and will not be mooved at all, unleſſe it be to laugh at him, and ſo they burne with the other <hi>Sodomites,</hi> becauſe they would not beleeve their danger. Thus doe men yet ſtill pull perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on themſelves, the Miniſters of the Goſpell preach to us to the ſame purpoſe, that <hi>Lot</hi> did ſpeake unto his ſonnes in Law. Come out of ſuch and ſuch a ſinne, for God will ſurely deſtroy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters of it, and what ſucceſſe doe we meete withall? After many an houre beſtowed in ſeeking to make men ſee, that if they doe ſuch things, they ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of Heaven, but ſhall fall into the Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, wee have no other fruit, our words appeare to them as if they were the words of one that mocked or were in jeſt, they will not be made to thinke that any ſuch danger is neere them. Tell mee, I beſeech you what you thinke? might not <hi>Lots</hi> two ſonnes have eſcaped this fire of <hi>Sodome</hi> if they would? What was the cauſe of their periſhing, but becauſe they would not beleeve their Father in Law? alſo they might have left the City with him and eſcaped the brimſtone. Surely beloved you ſhall be able to alledge nothing at the laſt day to make your deſtruction more tollerable, for why doe you periſh but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

you will not give credit to the threats of God? and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to leave all ſinne which you may as well indeavour to leave, if your wilfullneſſe did not hinder, as <hi>Lots</hi> ſonnes might have left <hi>Sodome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you ſay, we could not beleeve thoſe words.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, true, but even as theſe wretches could not beleeve their Father, becauſe by hardening themſelves in evill they had made themſelves obſtinate againſt every thing that croſſed their carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. It is a fearefull ſinne Brethren, to be no otherwiſe affected to the threats denounced againſt your ſinnes by Gods Miniſters, then as theſe graceleſſe young men, even to thinke them but words of ſport, counterfeit words which have no truth nor ſubſtance in them, but were very mockery and ſcoffage: ſo thought theſe fooliſh fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, but in the morning they were made to feele what they would not beleeve at midnight; when they ſcorched in the flames, they in vaine repented their ill entertainement of their Father in Lawes ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and perſwaſions, and to no purpoſe wiſhed that they had beene over-intreated by him. A number of you live in the ſelfe-ſame ſinne, hee that threatens hell-fire and deſtruction againſt you, for your drunkenneſſe, filthineſſe, revenge, worldlineſſe, is counted a mocker, an idle fellow, that knowes not what hee ſaith, but muſt ſay ſomething when he is gotten into his Pulpit, and no more recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doe you make of it: but when death hath carried your ſoules to hell, then you ſhall too late accuſe your owne folly, and wiſh you had hearkened with more beliefe.

But his high fancies are ever ſtrong and working in him, when his heart is ſo filled up with darkeneſſe and blindneſſe, that either he doth not at all or not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely know theſe things. A drunken beggar will carry himſelfe like ſome Emperour, and he cares for no man, becauſe he hath not the wit to take notice of his owne baſeneſſe. So it is with the proud man, ſo very a foole hee is that hee cannot inſtruct himſelfe of his owne contemptibleneſſe, and therefore he is apt to be lifted up in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, now folly and ignorance be ſo vile things themſelves, that no naturall iſſue of them can chooſe but be like themſelves even ſinfull and wicked.</p>

               <hi>Hee that exalteth himſelfe ſhall be abaſed.

               <note place="margin">Jer. 13.17.</note> noting that this fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy pride doth even ſtop up the eares againſt all wholeſome advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. O how fearefull a vice is that which cuts off the way to all amendment, by turning away the eare from receiving inſtruction, the principall inſtrument of working amendment?</p>
            <p>But it produceth many ſinfull carriages in all reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt in reſpect of all perſons. Secondly, of all ſtates. Thirdly, of all qualities. For perſons, it makes him in whom it ruleth, and ſo farre as it ruleth rebellious againſt Gods precepts, careleſſe of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and regardleſſe of his threats, ſo that hee deſpiſeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth all the authority of God, and will not be guided by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. <hi>Caine</hi> was a proud man you all know, hee would never elſe have killed his Brother on that quarrell whereof you heard. Now when God himſelfe came to admoniſh him and diſſwade him from that murder, it was all in vaine, hee would not hearken to God, but continued to harbour malice till it brake forth into bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of men, for ones ſelfe it makes him ſelfe-iſh, all for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not regarding who be hurt ſo himſelfe be pleaſed, ſelfe-willed and heady, ſo that no counſell will rule, but hee will head ſtrongly like a madded beaſt runne on in his owne race, as the Captaines that came to <hi>Ieremy</hi> for counſell, becauſe they were proud men, and as the Scripture notes would not accept of his counſell. And it fills him full alwaies of diſcontent, fretting and vexation, nothing, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can pleaſe him, he is ſtill finding faults, juſt like one that hath a ſwelling upon his hand, ſomething or other toucheth it ſtill and drives him to out-cries.</p>
            <p>And for others, towards his ſuperiours he is undutifull and will not heed their words nor be ruled by them. He thinkes himſelfe too good to receive their correction or reproofes or chaſtiſements, and growes worſe rather then better. For his inferiours he is likely tyrannicall and Lionlike, and cares not how he diſgraceth, and wrongeth, and over-pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth them, rating and ſtriking, and laying about him even for nothing or as good as nothing. For thoſe that are more proſperous then himſelfe and excell him in any thing he is ever envious and ſpitefull
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:27208:126"/>
and malignes them for it. For thoſe that are below him, he is ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diſdainefull, and inſolent in deriding and ſleighting them, for his equals hee is arrogant and inſolent too, ſtill lifting himſelfe above them and preferring himſelfe before them. If he meete with men in a good eſtate he grudgeth at them, if with miſerable men he ſcornes them; and paſſeth by them pittileſly, if not ſcoffingly. And towards all in generall, he is contentious and froward, ready to picke and proſecute quarrells, to make the worſt of every thing, and to take all with the left hand ready to work in proud wrath, quickly angry, and apt to vent his anger in lofty and ſcornefull ſpeeches, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, revilings, upbraidings. If he deale with friends, he is unthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they muſt be his ſlaves ſtill to humour him in every thing, alſo all former good turnes, are forgotten; towards his enemies he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely revengfull, cares not what ill he doth them in requitall, and will ſcarce ever forget an imaginary wrong. I meane ſuch a one as doth ſeeme none to any but himſelfe, and thoſe whom he hath made crooked by a falſe and partiall relation. Thus in reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>For eſtates give him adverſity, he is ſullen, dogged, impatient, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtoope to it: blames every body for it and cares not what ſhifts he uſeth to get out. Give him proſperity, he abuſeth it and doth miſchiefe with it, at leaſt doth no good with it but makes it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of ſerving his pride and other luſts, ſo that hee is good for nothing in any place, he can ſtoope to no burden, nor buckle to no ſervice, being juſt like a goutie legg, well neither lying ſtill nor ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or a ſicke body neither well a bed nor up.</p>
            <p>For qualities, the good qualities of others he knowes how to vitiate, traduce, calumniate and make them ſeeme vices, and will have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to ſay to blemiſh them. For bad qualities he makes them worſe then they be, aggravates them by miſ-relating, and turnes them into a jeſt and laughter, ſcorning rather then pitying him in whom he thinkes they be, as the Phariſee did the Publican. His owne ill qualities, he will not ſee, he will not confeſſe, he will not mend, but hides them, excuſes them, defends them, and many times boaſteth in them. His good qualities he marres and corrupts, and doth ſo lift himſelfe up for them, that moſt times they be even troubleſome to others and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull to himſelfe, he knowes them ſo too well and makes ſo too much of them, that no man elſe can finde any commendable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them, they be but matter for bragging and boaſting and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling gay tales of himſelfe, what he hath done or can doe; ſo it makes his vices worſe, and turnes his vertues even into vices. Can that be other then a moſt hatefull and filthy vice that bringeth forth ſo many bad effects? and yet all theſe and many more that I cannot reckon up, doe moſt apparantly follow from pride in what degree it ſelfe is ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to prevaile in men.</p>
            <p>Now I pray you beloved ſearch into your ſelves, and looke about if you cannot ſee this vice abroad in your neighbours. Let me propound
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:27208:127"/>
this queſtion to each of you, doe you know never a proud man in the Towne? and doe you ſee never a one in the Church whom you judge to be full of pride? you would anſwer this queſtion in your owne hearts. Doe you ſee or know a proud man or woman in the place where you dwell? I am afraid, you that be poore will looke upon the gayer cloathes of the wealthie, and ſay without doubt they be monſtrous proud that muſt weare ſuch gay things about them, when others of as good earth as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves goe almoſt naked or ſo ſimply clad. And I feare, leaſt you that are wealthy will finde cauſe to blame ſuch a one and ſuch a one for pride, becauſe their carriage is ſo and ſo: many of you can ſee pride (I doubt not) peeping out of the poore mans rags, and craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling like a vermine out of his meane garment: yea, you that be poore, I feare will finde a great deale of pride abroad, you will not returne without finding it, for in truth it is a fruit of pride to finde pride every where but in ones ſelfe. Therefore I recant this ſpeech now, and I pray you leave that forreine inquirie, and come you home every ſoule to himſelfe, and ſearch at home each in his owne boſome, houſe, carriage. And tell mee or rather God who ſpeakes to each, art not thou thy ſelfe ſomewhat a kinne to the generation of <hi>Sodome?</hi> a veſſell in whom the Divell and fleſh hath laid up a deale of pride.</p>
            <p>You may perhaps aske me, how any man may know whether he be proud or no, I meane over-come with pride, full of it, over-ruled by it.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake to thee that art poore and courſely clad, Doe not you thinke that you are as good men and women as thoſe that are fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier clad? and if you had as good ſuites and ornaments as they, you ſhould be never a whit inferiour to them: have you not theſe kinde of vying buzling thoughts in you? in truth, this is nothing but pride. And you that are richer, doe you not count theſe poore ſnakes almoſt nothing? the mudde, the ſcumme, three-halfe-pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creatures, leſſe then duſt almoſt to you, muſhroms, ſhrubs, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, theſe thoughts proclaime you to be monſtrous proud, and if you goe away with them on either ſide and find them not, ſtop them not, blame them not, it is certaine this vice hath a ſtrong partie in you and in very deed doth over-maſter you. 'Tis pride of heart we ſeeke for, and 'tis nothing but pride that ſets up theſe briſtling thoughts in you.</p>
            <p>But yet I ſhall give you another note, nothing is a ſurer proofe of over-ruling pride, then this, that a man ſees no pride in himſelfe, neither will confeſſe it to his owne heart: It is certaine, this vice is as naturall to all mankinde as it is to be borne with eyes in their heads, with a mouth, with an heart, with a liver, with braine: The vitall parts of our body doe not more ſurely come into the world with us, then this vitall part of the body of death and of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now if you have never ſeene it nor could meete with it in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:27208:127"/>
the effects of it, ſo as to know it, it is onely becauſe you are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and blinde, and the more ignorant of your corruptions the more proud. When vices be not ſeene, they be not lamented, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with ſpirituall weapons, nay not with naturall good conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations neither, and the leſſe they be reſiſted, the more they grow, and the more they grow, the ſtronger and bigger they be, and the more they rule in him in whom they be. If it were not therefore for want of underſtanding, by this time a great number of you might perceive that you deſerve to be called ſonnes of pride, for your ſelves cannot denie, but that you have in a manner alwaies denied your ſelves to be proud, you never ſaw it in your hearts, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed before God with ſecret ſorrow for it; Lord I am very proud, ſuch and ſuch effects proove mee to be very proud. And without doubt, hee that never did thus ſtrive to mortifie his pride, cannot but be a very proud man. Loe now I have ſhewed you how to finde out your pride, by not finding it out, and this is the ſureſt way of finding it, where it is moſt it hides it ſelfe moſt from his eyes in whom it is, like the foundation of a building that is underground, though it beare up all that is above the ground, or like ſome ſecret di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper in the inwards that ſhewes not it ſelfe but by its effects.</p>
            <p>But let mee tell you what pride is, that you may the better know it and acknowledge it when you meete with it.<note place="margin">Pride what it is?</note> I ſhall deſcribe it in the words of an excellent deſcriber of vices. The inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ones owne excellencie is but an effect of it. The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells you moſt briefely, and yet moſt clearely, what it is, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.3.</note> 
               <hi>If a man thinke himſelfe to be ſomething when hee is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, hee deceiveth himſelfe.</hi> Loe a ſingular definition of this vice. It is that vice, by which a man thinkes himſelfe ſomething when he is nothing; whereby hee makes too great reckoning of himſelfe, judging himſelfe to be better then hee is, taking himſelfe for gold when he is but copper, for a goodly thing when hee is but dirt, for ſomething when hee is nothing, ſaith our Apoſtle. Pride is the vice of over-prizing himſelfe, ſetting too much ſtore by himſelfe, as a childe out of his folly makes a great account of a white pibble-ſtone, ſo man out of his folly makes great reckoning unduely of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſets too high a price on himſelfe, as a covetous over-reaching Chapman on his wares. A man if he would conſult with himſelfe could not but confeſſe that he is nothing, but hee doth, with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as ſome folkes, doe by Dogs and Monkies, they know they be paltry carrions, beaſts, yet they ſet great ſtore by them and make pretious account of them for their mindes ſake, ſo doe we men by our ſelves, notwithſtanding the imperfect knowledge of our nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and this is the pride of heart which wee ſeeke for. O ſee it, ſee it, that is it rules in each of us naturally, every ſonne of <hi>Adam</hi> makes an over-great account of himſelfe, ſets himſelfe at too high a rate, for ſo ſlender is the knowledge of God that hee ſets more by himſelfe then by God, and I am ſure that is to ſet too much
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:27208:128"/>
by himſelfe. A man counts himſelfe ſomething that is nothing, yea he accounts him that is nothing, more then him that is infinitely more then all things. Judge you if there be not cauſe that God ſhould reſiſt him in whom there is this vice regnant, this high thing that lifts it ſelfe againſt the knowledge of God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew you the degrees of this vice now. They be two, predominant and mortified, predominant where it is not depoſed by the power of ſanctifying grace, which alone killeth ſinne, and ſo it ruleth in all men naturally, and will rule untill the Lord beſtow his humbling Spirit upon them, which making them firmely to beleeve the doctrine of mans miſery begins by little and little to daſh them quite out of conceit with themſelves, and to eſteeme themſelves the baſeſt of all creatures almoſt, even creatures worthy to be damned and moſt vile therefore. But when pride is thus caſhiered by the entring in of true humiliation, there it no longer raigneth, there it is continually obſerved, the evill fruite of it noted, arraigned, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before God, and many an heavy ſigh and ſupplication is ſent up to God againſt it; and there it is not a King, a Commander, there it is not imputed, there it doth not denominate the man, but where it is not thus depoſed and dethroned, it is not marked, the ill fruits of it are not drawne before Gods tribunall, they are not ſorrowfully confeſſed, nor carefully reſiſted, there it is the Lord of the heart, and there it doth raigne and is imputed, and doth denominate the man in whom it is, and he is a proud man.</p>
            <p>But now where it raigneth, it is to be found in two plaine differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In the one it is like unto a beaſt that is fed fat at graſſe, or is well provendred with good feeding, luſty and ſtrong, and ſturdy and bolde. In the other it is like unto the ſame beaſt, kept leane and poore, and weake and feeble, over wrought, thinly fed, and ill provendred; It is the ſame beaſt. ſtill, but it ſcarce lookes like the ſame, or carries it ſelfe like the ſame: Sometimes pride is fed with wealth and honour, and theſe outward things in abundance, and with great excellent parts of nature, wit, learning, beauty, ſtrength and the like, yea and with a kind of fiery temper of body. When it hath all, or many of theſe encouragements and helpes, it is like a flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing King that goes abroad in progreſſe among his people; then it is bold and audacious to produce its ill effects, it dares ſhew it ſelfe in its proper perſon, and be ſeene by any eye, then will a man affirme to himſelfe, that he is a perſon of ſome valew, one that hath ſuch wit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why he is I hope a worthy and excellent perſon. So pride will ſtare a man in the face, and profeſſe it ſelfe if it be well helped up with theſe outward things; But if it be kept downe with poverty, with meaneneſſe in outward reſpects, and with great croſſes, then it is ſomewhat fearefull to be ſeene, then it hides its head, it is like a King brought behind by rebels, who keepes himſelfe within ſome place of fortification, and will not commit himſelfe to hazard, but ſtill he is a King, and takes upon him as a King. So pride in ſuch will
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:27208:128"/>
not make a man ſay plainely he is ſome body, he is a perſon of worth, but ſtill in the ſecret of his heart he makes high account of himſelfe and is ready (as I ſaid before) to think he is as good a man, though he be not as rich, as learned; yea ſometimes this vice of pride though raigning, yet is like a bad tyrannicall Prince, kept in by ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of ſpeciall truſt, as <hi>Ioaſh</hi> by <hi>Iehojada.</hi> I meane, it is a little held in compaſſe by good education and precepts of morality, and a kinde of reſtraining grace, and then it is farre more moderate in its effects, and will not ſo exceſſively bewray it ſelfe, other times it is like a tyrant, which hath a councell as bad as him ſelfe, it rangeth whether it liſteth, when it wants good education, and reſtraint of a divine hand to keepe it downe, and then the effects of it be prodigious. Know therefore that a man may be under the dominion of pride, though he be not ſo outragious and enormious in the effects of it, as ſome others be, and if you will take a true triall, here it is. I can know what account any man makes of a thing by his carriage, when that thing is depreſſed, abuſed, wronged, vilified, and ſo may I know what account I make of my ſelfe by my demeanour in occaſion of ſuch uſage.</p>
            <p>When you have learnt how to find out this ſinne, if you pleaſe,<note place="margin">The meanes to ſubdue. pride.</note> will you learne alſo to ſubdue it? the way is firſt to marke the fruites of it, as they breake forth in your lives, which fruits we have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered before. Impatiency, bragging, contention, envying, ſleighting and deſpiſing of others, and eſpecially working in proude wrath, that is, falling into ſuch extreame fits of anger, that a man cares not almoſt what hee ſaith or doth to them that have angered him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When you finde them to fall upon them with ſorrow and lamentation, arraigning and judging your ſelves for them before God, and labour to make your ſelves ſeeme baſe in your owne eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To pray heartily againſt it, and to beg the Spirit of God to humble you and caſt you downe. There is a thing that looketh ſomewhat like humility, and it is nothing but a heart a little kept downe with croſſes, or with education and good inſtructions, this may be found where the Spirit of ſanctification is not, but true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is an effect of Gods Spirit thoroughly ſanctifying the heart. A man by being conſcious to himſelfe of his owne naturall imperfections and defects may be kept a little under, ſo that his pride will not ſo boldly lift up it ſelfe, but no man depoſeth pride from raigning, but by the Spirit of God, you muſt therefore intreat the Lord by the operation of his Spirit to ſubdue your pride.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, You muſt exerciſe your ſelves in good meditations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, Firſt, your naturall miſery and meaneneſſe. Secondly, your ſpirituall. The naturall ſeene in our birth, life, death, entrance into the world, continuance in it, departure out of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, how little and meane are we in reſpect of our entrance, what did we come from at firſt, and originally but very nothing? there
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:27208:129"/>
was a time when we were not, having alone a potentiall being, that is, a being not yet in being, but alone lockt up as it were in the cauſes of it; yea there was a time, when wee were not in any ſecondary cauſes, but alone in the omnipotency of God, who was able to make us of nothing. And ſurely, that which comes from nothing can be no exceeding excellent thing in it ſelfe, and if it have any excellency, it hath it from another, to whom all the glory of it is due. Yea what was the matter of which God made us at the firſt? not gold, ſilver, braſſe, iron, wood, or any more then common thing, but even the duſt of the earth, for you have heard how <hi>Adam</hi> was formed. Doubtleſſe the Lord did this of purpoſe to miniſter matter of humbling men unto their meditations; for if I came from duſt, I ſhall ſurely ſavour of mine originall; a thing made will have a reliſh of the matter whereof it is made, unleſſe it receive an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great change, therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> confeſſed unto the Lord, <hi>I am duſt and aſhes.</hi> Call we our ſelves by that name ſeriouſly and often, and duſt cannot ſwell: it may be blowne away, it cannot be puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up.</p>
            <p>But let us looke upon a man in the courſe of his life, and that with reference to the good he hath and can doe, and to the evill he hath or is able to doe. The good he hath firſt is exceeding little, compared to that which God and Angels have, as no man will deny that ſhall make the compariſon; Now he ought if he were wiſe to compare himſelfe with his betters, and not with his inferiours. Set a man in ballance to a beaſt he is ſome body, he hath reaſon, wiſedome, and the like, ſet him in the ballance with God, he is a meere foole, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of weakeneſſe and vanity, all he doth know, all he can know, is leſſe then nothing. Yea compare him with an Angel, how ſilly is he, how feeble? one Angell is able to know more then all men, and to doe more, one Angell can beguile all men and deſtroy all men; yea if you compare him with beaſts, he hath a little more wit then moſt of them, but they have ſtronger bodies, perfecter ſences are able to teare him in peeces, and can live without him many of them better then he without them, ſo that he is more beholding to them then they to him. So his good is little, little knowledge in reſpect of what God and Angels have, and in reſpect of that he once had, and might have had ſtill, but that himſelfe deprived himſelfe of it. Little ſtrength even in compariſon of beaſts, and muſt continue here but for a little time.</p>
            <p>Againe, this little is all borrowed, it is none of his owne; he hath it of meere curteſie, and from the goodneſſe of another, ſo that he is not to be counted better for it, but alone more indebted: who ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for a borrowed thing; or if he doe, who doth not befoole him for it? If a man that hath no horſe be friended with a good one, ſhall he be proud of it? and is not all we have borrowed?</p>
            <p>Nay thirdly muſt we not be accountable for all we have, ſo that we are but as ſervants which have charge of their matters goods, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:27208:129"/>
and muſt anſwer how they have ordered it, ſhall ſuch a perſon bee proud?</p>
            <p>And laſtly, what we have is uncertaine too, 'tis moveable 'tis flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wee may looſe it we know not how ſoone; we are like te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants at will, that cannot challenge ſo much as a quarter, nay not a weeke or minute: it ill becomes ſo meane a thing to thinke well of it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now for the evill we have, that is much, and our owne, that is inſeperable and inavoideable, it is great. O to how many and ſore croſſes is every man ſubject? to diſeaſes, to caſualities for goods, to madneſſe, to injuries, and to a 1000. unhappineſſes, from which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſedome nor ſtrength, nor riches, nor high places can fence and ſave him, eſpecially to the vexation of his owne heart, which is enough to make him miſerable though he were rid of all other evils. And theſe evils are come unto him as due puniſhments of his owne ſinnes, as fruits of his ill deſervings, and as effects of his owne folly, and miſery is ſhamefull as well as bitter, when it is juſtly imputable to the perſons ill carriage that ſuffers it, becauſe his faults have brought it on himſelfe, and this evill is properly his owne, becauſe he owes it to none properly but to himſelfe, neither can any care of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, but he ſhall be ſo during life, and ever as he lives longer ſo ſhall he be ſubject to more miſery. Indeed ſome men ſcape in this world with more eaſe then divers others, but every man hath his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, enough to make him know himſelfe to be nothing, and enough to daſh pride out of countenance, if he would not hide his owne eyes from taking notice of it.</p>
            <p>Now looke to him in his end, how little a thing will kill him? a haire, or a ſtone of a raiſin, the leaſt thing going awry. How little a place will hold him when he is dead? a poore winding ſheete, a coffin, a little hole in the earth, how little can he doe then? nothing but feede wormes and yeeld forth a ſtinking ſmell. Looke upon a man lying upon his death-bed, groaning and panting for life, looke upon him in his winding ſheete and coffin, bound hand and foote, and impriſoned in that narrow ſtockes. Looke upon him in his grave, rotting and ſmelling and putrifying, and I hope you will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, he hath cauſe to make but meane account of himſelfe, ſo will theſe thoughts helpe to chaſe out pride.</p>
            <p>But conſider a man in his ſpirituall miſery, he was conceived in ſinne, he is of his father the Divell, he is a ſlave to ſinne, a traitor to God. He is full of all wickedneſſe, deſtitute of all holineſſe, and cannot eſcape eternall damnation by any worth or power of his owne, but muſt needes ſinke downe to hell, and be made fuell for that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall burning. You ſee by what meanes you may ſubdue pride, hee that findeth it out and reſiſteth it with theſe weapons, ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly prevaile againſt it, hee that thinkes himſelfe free from it and takes no paines to ſubdue it, ſhall ſurely bee conquered by it.</p>

It is to be confeſſed that the beſt of men be too proud even now, notwithſtanding all the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they have felt, and ſinnes they have committed.

Fulneſſe of bread.</note>The next fault is, fulneſſe of bread, this is reckoned as a fault, and either it is ſo indeed, or the Spirit of God was deceived, who put it downe here in the catalogue of Sodomitiſh crimes. You muſt either grant that fulneſſe of bread is a foule ſinne, or elſe you muſt tell the Prophet that himſelfe and the Spirit by which he ſpake were both in an error.<note place="margin">Luk. 16.19.</note> 'Tis attributed to <hi>Dives</hi> in the Parable, <hi>hee fared deliciouſly every day.</hi> 'Tis charged on wealthy men, as one of the ſinnes that ſhall procure their howling and miſery, <hi>you have nouriſhed your ſelves in the day of ſlaughter,</hi>

Abundance of idleneſſe.</note>The third is abundance of idleneſſe, here is the fault it ſelfe idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the meaſure of it, very much idleneſſe. Idleneſſe is a ſinne eſpecially when it growes to be abundance of idleneſſe. <hi>Salomon</hi> hath bent himſelfe to the diſgrace of this fault in many of his Proverbes, <hi>Goe to the piſmire O ſluggard,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>There are divers reaſons to prove this fault to be a great ſinne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is a croſſing of that end which God had in making man; hee made him to be uſefull and profitable as the members of the body, idleneſſe makes him unprofitable; hee gave him a minde and a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, fit for uſefull and laborious imployments, he ſpends this ſtrength to no purpoſe. So he doth even thwart Gods intention in creating all things, and himſelfe among the reſt, for all were made for labour in ſome fruitfull matter, as we ſee the Sunn and heavenly bodies, the waters and trees, and all the creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, he depriveth himſelfe of all right in conſcience to foode
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:27208:130"/>
and other neceſſaries, and maketh himſelfe a theefe in all he eateth and drinketh, and ſpendeth, for this cauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>hee that will not worke let him not eate,</hi> ſo hee is interdicted the uſe of Gods creatures, as it were a man baniſhed out of the world. A civill right in the courts of juſtice hee hath to the poſſeſſing of things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his title to them and intereſt in them, but a conſcionable right to the uſe of them hee hath not,<note place="margin">Verſe 11.</note> therefore <hi>Paul</hi> wiſheth men to labour and eate their owne bread, intimating that it is not their owne in the court of conſcience before God if they gaine not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to it by paines.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, idleneſſe is a great nouriſher of all vices. It nouriſheth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> pride and ſelfe-conceitedneſſe,<note place="margin">Prov. 26.26.</note> 
               <hi>For the ſluggard is wiſer in his owne eyes then ſeven men that can render a reaſon;</hi> he is apt to filthineſſe and luſt, why was <hi>Sodome</hi> ſo lewd, but becauſe they were idle? Every temptation doth eaſily ſeize upon him that is at leaſure, and doth nothing, as a bird that ſitteth ſtill on a tree is eaſily hit with an arrow or bullet. He can have while to hearken to a temptation, and to ruminate upon the evill things which Satan and the fleſh doe ſtirre up. In nature things that lie ſtill gather ruſt, and ſtanding water ſoone breeds noyſome creatures, and ſoone putrifies, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially idleneſſe makes a man a buſie body, full of medling with other folkes matters, and that for the moſt part to do more hurt then good. The nature of man is active, and if it be not imployed in ſome uſefull thing, it muſt follow ſinne and vanity.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this ſinne expoſeth a man to want, <hi>Idleneſſe will cloath with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ragges, his penurie commeth like an armed man,</hi> and <hi>like a traveller,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 23.21. &amp; 6.11.</note> haſtily, ſurely, ſtrongly, it cannot be reſiſted, it will not linger, <hi>Hee that followeth vaine perſons ſhall have poverty enough;</hi>

               <hi>The ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard will not plow in Winter, therefore hee muſt begge in Summer and have nothing.</hi> And if it fall out, that great meanes doe keepe an idle perſon from want, yet hee hath a moſt poore and beggarly ſoule, utterly deſtitute of ſaving graces and vertues, for he muſt labour for theſe things that will attaine them.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee, what idleneſſe is. It is that vice,<note place="margin">What Idleneſſe is.</note> by which men refuſe to beſtow themſelves conſtantly and painefully in ſome profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing, and take leave to ſpend their pretious time in things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. Some things are unprofitable ſimply, as fond and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoughts, tatling and vaine words, ſome things are unprofitable accidentally, in reſpect of their exceſſe, as ſports and paſtimes, and ſleepe, and eaſe, and ſitting ſtill, and in reſpect of the manner of doing, as dealing with a ſlacke hand and working by halves. He that will not continue to take paines in things uſefull and beneficiall to himſelfe and others, but whileth out his time in ſitting ſtill and twatling with others of matters impertinent to him, or uſeleſſe in themſelves, or diſcourſing with himſelfe about like points, or gives himſelfe to exceſſe of ſleepe or of ſports, or elſe followes his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe by the halves, this man is idle, and if hee doe ſo much and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:27208:131"/>
often and almoſt continually, then is hee guilty even of abundance of idleneſſe.</p>
            <p>I pray you every one, ſet your conſciences a worke to finde out your owne ſinnefullneſſe in this kinde; Doe not many of your hands refuſe to labour? Are you not ſuch as will not worke? Some are idle, becauſe they have beene ſo ill educated, that they have not fitted themſelves for any calling, they have nothing to doe nor cannot tell how to beſtow themſelves and their times. Theſe are a kinde of vagrant people, though they have meanes enough to live of, cyphers, good for nothing, but to eate and drinke, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Apes, Monkies, whoſe whole life is to eate and drinke and ſleepe and ſport, and ſit and talke and laugh and be merry. Theſe are excrements in humane ſocieties, and the moſt miſerable of the ſonnes of men, as having brought upon themſelves by long uſe an habit of being idlesbees, and a kind of neceſſity to continue naughty; yet ſuch a neceſſity as doth not excuſe but aggravate the fault: others againe are idle, becauſe though they have a calling, yet they have no minde to follow it, but are eſtranged from the workes of their vocation, and love to be gadding and rambling hither and thither, and every where, but where they ſhould be. Theſe are great offendors, this idleneſſe turnes their foode into poyſon, many ſuch ſloathfull doe-naughts there are in the world. There be ſome ſervants ſluggiſh, ſlow-backs, whoſe hand is no ſooner from under the Governours eye, but that it is alſo off from the worke, and they leave all and ſit downe to talke by the fire-ſide, or in a corner being men of tongue, and further then eye-ſervice drives them to it, their chiefe imployment is twattle.</p>
            <p>Now I pray you, if any be guilty to themſelves of lazineſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe to exerciſe themſelves painefully in their callings, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with hand or head or both, that they take notice of it, ſure they be of kinne to theſe miſcreants the <hi>Sodomites;</hi> now begin to labour in this worthy worke of repenting for thine unprofitable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. For ſure, if men muſt give an account for every idle word, then other parts of idleneſſe muſt likewiſe be brought unto the reckoning. I pray thoſe that be of the richer ſort, that doe not finde a neceſſity of labouring laide upon them for their bellies ſake, to take heed that they paſſe not over their idleneſſe as a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Moſt times riches make men turne <hi>Sodomites,</hi> they are proud, they give themſelves to fullneſſe of bread, and to abundance of idleneſſe, they will not ſet themſelves to any diligent following of any good worke, but delight in that which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman would not doe,<note place="margin">Prov. 31.21.</note> 
               <hi>to eate the bread of idleneſſe.</hi> Surely the God that made them as well as other men with bodies and mindes fitted to doe ſervice, will not brooke their doing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, I pray you ſhun, ſhun this <hi>Sodomitiſh</hi> ſinne, take not liberty to be idle, but lay out your time ſo that you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:27208:131"/>
anſwer it to God the Maker of it and of you. Time is a thing moſt pretious, all the wealth under Heaven cannot redeeme one miſpent minute, by how much it is more deare and irremediable, by ſo much ought it to be more carefully husbanded and warily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. Therefore, be you painefull in your callings, breake off ſleepe ſeaſonably in the morning; ſet cloſe to ſome needfull actions in the day, give not the greater part of your time to ſports, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting idle and diſcourſing of this and that, but follow the workes of your calling, and frame your ſelves to ſome calling, make your ſelves a vocation in ſome matter or other, that ſhall be worth your time. Painefullneſſe in a calling will kill many vices, it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe all vertues, it will prevent many temptations and ſinnes: it will make ones life comfortable, and his heart in good meaſure hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſcreete. It will be a content at death, to thinke one hath not waſted his life for nothing. Doe not dare to ſlip away from the workes of your calling but upon good ground, when you are able to alledge ſome better thing to be done inſteed of it, or juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of intermitting it, for your better fitting and inabling to it. I doe not commend toyleſomeneſſe to you, but due diligence in your places, that may cauſe you to differ much from the inhabitants of <hi>Sodome.</hi> Eſpecially, give not your ſelves to exceſſive ſleepe and ſports; <hi>Salomon</hi> hath condemned the ſluggard and the man that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth paſtime to the ſtockes of want, and one way or another the Lord will finde a time and meanes to caſt them into thoſe ſtockes.</p>
            <p>Doe not all things invite you to diligence in a calling? ſee, what care the Sunne hath to runne his daily and yeerely courſe according to its proper nature, ſee how all the reſt of the heavenly armie doe keepe themſelves in their owne places, and ſwiftly performe their owne motions. See how the waters doe ebbe and flow, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, ſee how the fountaines make haſt to the brookes and rivers, and the rivers to the Sea; ſee how all things almoſt are ſtill in action. The earth that keepes in one place, yet is ſtill doing ſomething in that place, either nouriſhing the rootes or the branches of the trees, and other things that grow on it, or elſe gathering heart to it ſelfe to doe the ſame worke better for a little reſpite and intermiſſion. And in Heaven, though theſe naturall actions ceaſe, yet the ſpirituall imployment of living, rejoycing in honouring and praiſing of God doth never ceaſe. Quicken up your ſelves therefore to this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of diligence, it is good for ſoule, good for body, good for ſtate, profitable every way, and at laſt will proove eaſie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull too, to him that doth it with moderation. The diligent man takes as much content in his moderate labour, as the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in ſomnolency and eaſefullneſſe. So much for this fault alſo.<note place="margin">4.

            </p>
            <p>A fourth is a ſinne of Omiſſion, and that is, <hi>they ſtrengthened not the hands of the poore.</hi> What is that? They did not releeve his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:27208:132"/>
with convenient ſupplie, but gave him either nothing at all, or but ſo ſmall a pittance, as would not ſuffice to give him any comfort.</p>
            <p>It is you ſee a great fault to be pinching to the poore, and either to give them nothing, or a very ſmall quantity almoſt as good as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Therefore he reckons it as a proofe of a good man that ſhall live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.16. <hi>Hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the naked with a garment;</hi> but when our Saviour came to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence the goates on the left hand, he giveth this reaſon of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> 
               <hi>I was ſicke and you did not viſit, hungry and you gave mee no meate, in priſon and you came not to mee:</hi> and when they alledged that they never ſaw him in ſuch diſtreſſed caſes, and withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from ſuccouring him, his anſwer is, <hi>in that you did it not to theſe, you did it not to mee.</hi> When the rich man refuſed to ſell all and give to the poore upon an extraordinary command from him, he lets him goe, and admits him not to follow him, nay by his words ſpoken immediately after,<note place="margin">Mar. 10.</note> 
               <hi>it is as poſsible,</hi> he excludeth him from Heaven, for he muſt needs be underſtood of that rich man and ſuch as he was. Now if not giving of all upon an extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, will ſhut a man out of the Kingdome, then the not giving of ſome convenient quantity upon an ordinary occaſion, muſt needs procure the like puniſhment, becauſe the diſobedience is equall in both caſes.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is, firſt, this is a flat diſobedience to moſt expreſſe plaine and frequent Commandements. There is ſcarce a duty of the ſecond Table which God hath more plainely laid downe, more often repeated, more earneſtly preſſed then this of giving to the poore. He therefore that liveth in perpetuall negligence of this dutie, and either will not acknowledge it or will not practiſe it, lives in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and conſtant rebellion againſt God. Thinke not my Brethren, that it ſufficeth to proove a man upright if hee doe not live in a ſinne of commiſſion, that is, in the continuance and allowed doing of ſomething forbidden by God. Nay if he live in a ſinne of omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the continuall and allowed neglect of a duty commanded, this is not to obey God in all things, this ſhewes ones heart is not univerſally ſubject to God. This prooveth that ſome vice hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in him and that he loveth and reſpecteth ſomething more then God, which cannot ſtand with uprightneſſe, yea beloved this hypocriſie which is ſo much over-awed as it were by cleereneſſe of knowledge, that it ſcarce dares diſcover it ſelfe by taking boldneſſe to commit ſinnes of commiſſion, but knowes how to hold in with ſinnes of omiſſion and to give them allowance enough, is ſo much the more dangerous by how much it is leſſe diſcernable. For hee ſeemeth to himſelfe to have much to ſay for himſelfe, why this duty ſhould not at this and this time binde him, becauſe no affirmative precept bindes to all times, and ſo hee will ſhift it from himſelfe in ſuch manner, as not to take notice that hee offendeth, whence groweth the greateſt perill of all. Therefore know you that this unmercifullneſſe to the poore, as prooving that obedience is
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:27208:132"/>
but partiall, and ſo that the heart is not upright is ſure a very great ſinne.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, it declareth that a man beleeveth not the promiſes of God, and ſo that his faith is not unfained. It is ſure, that as hee which obeyeth not all Gods Commandements obeyeth none, ſo he that beleeveth not all his promiſes beleeveth none. For if we ſubmit to his truth becauſe it is a perfect truth, wee muſt grant that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie nor be deceived in any thing, and if wee build not our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to his words upon his truth, that cannot be called faith at all. Now God hath made ſo many, ſo evident, ſo full promiſes to thoſe that are mercifull to the poore, as no other duty almoſt can alledge for it ſelfe. A promiſe throughly beleeved, muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce obedience to the Commandement whereto it is annexed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every man is ſo truly deſirous of his owne welfare, that what hee doth ſtedfaſtly perſwade himſelfe will procure good unto him with the paines and coſt, for that hee will ſurely put himſelfe to the paines and to the coſt. Hee theerefore that is not mercifull doth not beleeve theſe promiſes, becauſe hee doth not obey the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to which they be joyned. How then doth hee beleeve any other promiſe? So we have prooved him by this argument to be voide of faith, and is not that a great ſinne which convinceth him to be void of faith in whom it is?</p>
            <p>Further, no man hath true charity that hath not a heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the hand of the poore; for S. <hi>Iohn</hi> makes the concluſion thus, <hi>Hee that loveth not his Brother whom hee hath ſeene,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.20.</note> 
               <hi>how doth hee love God whom he hath not ſeene?</hi> And hee doth but lie that ſaith hee loves a man, unleſſe he be ready to releeve him, for S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>love is bountifull,</hi> wherefore, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is peremptory in this con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>concluſion, ſaying, <hi>He that hath this worlds goods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.17.</note> 
               <hi>and ſeeth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath neede, and ſhutteth up his compaſsion againſt him, how dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the love God?</hi> That therefore is a great offence, which proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that a man hath either none, or none but counterfeit cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewed you what a grievous offence this is of the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites;</hi> afore I paſſe from it, let mee ſhew unto you a neceſſary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of poore men.<note place="margin">Two ſorts of poore men. 1. Gods poore.</note> Some are Gods poore as I may terme them, ſome the Divels.

The Divels poore are thoſe whom idleneſſe, waſtfullneſſe and unthriftineſſe doth make poore, becauſe either their hands refuſe to labour, or elſe they conſume it all up ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſly when they have gotten it. The former kinde of poore you ought to ſtrengthen, and the not ſtrengthening of them is a ſinne. To ſtrengthen the hands of the latter is to ſtrengthen their ſinne, and therefore their hands muſt not be ſtrengthened, for S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Canon is againſt it, <hi>He that will not labour ſhall not eate.</hi>

               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:27208:133"/>Now conſider every man of himſelfe, may it not be juſtly ſaid of you, that you doe not ſtrengthen the hands of the poore. Are not a number of you in your owne conſciences convinced? or if you would not winke, might bee convinced, that you doe not ſtrengthen the poore mans hands. When have you with any wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe given to any poore man any reaſonable quantity? Yea, how backward are a number of you to give any thing at all. Here is ſuch complaining amongſt you of your being ſeiſed too much one, and too much another, that it is more then evident, you have little will to part with your money to his purpoſe, I know not what skill to uſe, for the faſtening of a reproofe upon a niggard, I will not ſo much as ſtrive to doe it therefore: But I call upon each of your conſciences, to become a juſt and true Judge againſt you, and to finde one your guiltineſſe and to give you no quiet, till it have made you confeſſe the fault and blame you for it. But I call upon conſcience in vaine I feare, for the conſcience of a nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is alwaies a bad conſcience, ſo inthralled to the love of money, that he will not want excuſes to make himſelfe thinke he need not do that duty by which he ſhould leſſen his heape. But theſe excuſes ſhall one day aggravate the ſinne, therefore whoſoever is an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in neglecting this duty of ſtrengthening the hands of the poore; I pray you give your conſciences leave to paſſe a right ſentence upon you, <hi>viz.</hi> that your faith, love, obedience are in that degree coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit and fained, that you take liberty to your ſelves to be ſlack in this ſervice.</p>
            <p>And now I muſt require you in Gods name, to take great care that this ſinne of <hi>Sodome</hi> doe not ſhew it ſelfe in you which would be counted Chriſtians, I ſuppoſe there is ſcarce a Congregation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many neere you, that hath beene more urged to this duty then I have urged you. <hi>Sodome</hi> had not the twentieth part of this helpe, If God take it ill of them that they did not eſtabliſh the poore mans hand, how will he be offended at it in you? If ever you will have comfort at your end? If ever you will have a reward of your religion? If ever you will be called any thing but Hypocrites by your owne conſciences? I call upon you to reforme this fault, ſtrengthen the poore mans hands.</p>
            <p>Thoſe poore that be idle, that be waſtfull, that make themſelves poore by carrying the dirty yoke of vice, ale-houſe haunting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I pray you chaſtize them, correct them, ſpare not for their crying. It is no more pitty to heare them complaine, then to heare a Woolfe howle when his foot is taken in a ſnare. But thoſe that be honeſt, ſober and good, and have not put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into this miſery, but are put into it by Gods hand. I pray you confirme their hands, helpe them to ſuch a quantity of releefe as may make their lives comfortable, ſupply their needs, that God may ſupply all your needes according to his riches in glory in Chriſt Jeſus. God giveth to ſome more, to ſome leſſe, that there
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:27208:133"/>
may be an equality through the bounty of the one, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the inequality in gathering. So it ſhould be concerning them of the houſhold of faith, you of the wealthier ſort that feare God, ſhould lay all your heads, hands, and hearts together to take ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the poorer ſort of the ſame place which make care to live well ſhould not be over-much ſcanted.

Haughtineſſe is a vice more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, conſiſting in this, that it maketh a mans outward carriage lofty and high.

               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.20.</note> This vertue of Faith is that by which a man beleeveth God in all that he ſpeaketh barely by vertue of his truth and indeceiveable authority.

            </p>
            <p>Conſider your ſelves therefore Bretheren, whether you alſo have this ſame vertue of Faith in your hearts, beleeving all that God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to you becauſe he ſpeaketh it, and ſpecially all his promiſes, and by name, that principall promiſe of grace and ſalvation by Chriſt, for without this Faith you cannot be the children of God. If you have it not, you are ſtrangers from God and from the covenant of grace. If you have it, you are his ſonnes and daughters, juſtified before him, and accepted in his ſight, through him the Beloved in whom the Father is well pleaſed. And therefore labour to get it, and to grow in it more and more, that it may exceedingly abound in you, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith it did in the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> But beware you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not your ſelves in a bare conceite of Faith, ſaying you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, when indeed you doe not ſo, but let your Faith be a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Faith, approoving it ſelfe by love and by obedience, that ſo you may indeed be the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and children of promiſe as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, and If you can thus approove your Faith, then rejoyce in it above all things, knowing that you are rich in Faith, though you want all outward things, for he that hath Faith hath God to bee his, and that is ſufficient to make him happy in the abſence of all other things.</p>
            <p>More particularly <hi>Iſaacs</hi> Faith ſhewed it ſelfe by many excellent effects in regard of God. For firſt, he ſubmitted himſelfe to God, to be offered on the Altar by his Father according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, not making any reſiſtance, becauſe his Father made it manifeſt unto him, that God had given him a commandement ſo to offer him. Hard it is to ſay, whether the obedience of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in being willing to offer his ſoone, or of <hi>Iſaac</hi> in yeelding up
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:27208:136"/>
himſelfe to be offered were greater, for a man doth likely love his life as well as he loveth his childe. Now <hi>Abraham</hi> ſubdued his love of his ſonne unto God, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſubdued the love of his life to God, both notable patternes of ſincere obedience: This example you reade in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.9. when <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> came to the place which God had appointed, <hi>Abraham built an Altar, laid on the woode, and ſtretched forth his hand and tooke the knife to ſlay his ſonne. Iſaac</hi> at that time was of ſuch an age, that he might have reſiſted his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being old, or have got himſelfe free by flight from him, but he gave up himſelfe into his Fathers hands, or rather into God hand, and yeelded his throate to the ſtroake of the ſacrificing knife. Hereby it is apparent, that he began to feare God betime, in that he would not withhold himſelfe from God, as his Father did not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his ſonne.</p>
            <p>O that we could approve our Faith by the like effects of it, even by a willing yeelding of our lives to him when he doth call for them, and not refuſe to die if he ſhould call us unto it for his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſake. God is the author and Lord of our lives, and nothing is more agreeable to reaſon, then that we ſhould be content to give up life and all into his hands, from whom we have received life and all things. And ſurely in this caſe it ſhall be proved true, which our Lord Jeſus telleth in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Mat. 10 39.</note> 
               <hi>whoſoever will looſe his life ſhall ſave it.</hi> As <hi>Iſaac</hi> was partaker of that great bleſſing wherewith the Lord rewarded <hi>Abraham</hi> for his obedience in offering of his ſonne, ſaying, <hi>in bleſsing I will bleſſe thee,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.17.</note> and in multiplying I will multiply thee.</hi> Neither Father nor ſonne you ſee were looſers, by yeelding up the one his ſonne, the other his life into the hands of God. But contrarily, <hi>hee that will ſave his life ſhall undoubtedly looſe his life,</hi> for he muſt neceſſarily die at ſome other time as all other men, and then his ſoule ſhall be loſt together with his life, becauſe he loved not God better then his life, and he that hateth not his owne life in compariſon of God, ſhall not be counted worthy of him.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore ſee that our ſoules be ſo thoroughly ſubjected unto God, if ever we deſire to be counted the ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the brothers of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> But oh how farre ſhort do very many of us come of this obedience? for how ſhould any man beleeve that we would readily part without lives for God, which will not part with honour or goods, or pleaſure, yea any of our ſinnes at his commandement. You be not <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> if you cannot be content to give up your lives to God, how much leſſe if you ſtand with him for other matters farre leſſe then life.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt part of <hi>Iſaacs</hi> goodneſſe to God-ward, he became obedient to death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he was devoute and religious, given to all holy exerciſes,<note place="margin">2. He was reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</note> by name, to meditation and prayer, principall exerciſes of piety and religious ſervices of God, for ſo it is noted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.25. <hi>Hee builded an altar there, and called on the name of the Lord.</hi> Loe here he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:27208:137"/>
God publikely by ſacrifices and prayers, and though it be not mentioned, that he offered or prayed before an Altar at any other time as I remember, yet this once naming of his piety is ſet downe, to ſignifie his conſtant care in this duty: his Father brought him up in it, therefore he could ſay, <hi>Where is the lambe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, the Lord hath aboliſhed ſuch kinde of Altars, and ſuch kinde of ſacrifices now ſince the comming of Jeſus Chriſt into the world, and offering himſelfe once for all as a propitiatory ſacrifice to take away the ſinnes of the world,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.10.</note> but yet now alſo we have an Altar, whereof they have no right to eate that partake of thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. Chriſt Jeſus is our Altar, who ſacrifieth all thoſe ſervices which we offer up unto God by him, and our ſacrifices are ſpirituall ſacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt. The offering of a contrite and broken heart God doth much eſteeme, the offering of praiſes and prayers, the calves of our lips done unto God in the name of Chriſt, are very pleaſing unto him; the preſenting of our ſelves, ſoules and bodies to him,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.16.</note> is exceeding delightfull, yea with doing of good and diſtributing as with ſacrifices, God is greatly contented, as S.<note place="margin">Phil. 4.18.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>theſe are an odour of ſweete ſavour, a ſacrifice acceptable and pleaſing to God.</hi> If a man retire himſelfe, and conſidering the death of Chriſt for ſinne, doe humbly preſent himſelfe before God, confeſſing his ſinnes, and judging himſelfe for them, and labour to lament them with hearty griefe before God, as cauſes of the death of his ſonne, this is a gratefull ſacrifice. If hee praiſe God in the Name of Chriſt as for all other benefits, ſo for the great bleſſing of redemption wrought by Chriſt, this alſo doth give a ſweete odour unto God; if he even conſecrate himſelfe to God, reſolving to walke before him in all upright obedience, praying for the Spirit of God to ſanctify him, that in all things he may pleaſe God, no Bullocke or Ram can pleaſe the Lord ſo well: If he ſet apart ſome portion of his wealth to God, and give it to releeve the neceſſities of the Saints, this is very ſweete incenſe, ſo that hee truſt not in the merit of the worke, as if it could deſerve any thing for the worthineſſe of it, but truſt alone in Chriſt for the acceptation of himſelfe and it, and all his ſervices. Would you confirme to your owne conſciences that you be true <hi>Iſaacs?</hi> Aske your ſelves then, doe you offer theſe burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, if not, you be not as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> childeren of the promiſe, if yea, you may aſſure your ſoules that you be. O then ſtudy to abound in theſe ſervices.</p>

Pray well and live well, pray ill and live ill. By this we have fellowſhip with God, by this we become acquainted with him, and make him as it were acquainted with us: by this we are made like unto him and draw grace from him, and are more and more tranſlated into his image. O reſolve to be conſtant in this ſervice, and let no temptation of Satan drive you from it, or interrupt you in it, let no backwardneſſe of the fleſh cauſe you to omit it, but doe it ſo well as you be able, and whatſoever objections ariſe breake thorough the ſame, and tell your ſelves, I will doe it, heard or not heard, accepted or not accepted, whatſoever I be, what ſins ſoever I ſhall have, I will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to call on the name of the Lord, I will doe my duty let me ſpeede as pleaſeth the Lord.</p>

               <note place="margin">5. He feared God.</note>Another particular thing in <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, that he was one which feared God, his heart ſtood in awe of God, he durſt not offend nor croſſe him, nor oppoſe himſelfe unto his good pleaſure. So it is noted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.33. that when he had unwittingly bleſſed <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> came in after him, he feared exceedingly, and would not reverſe that bleſſing, but ſaid, <hi>I have bleſſed him and he ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> and therefore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.53. <hi>Iacob</hi> ſweareth by the <hi>feare of his Father Iſaac,</hi> that is, that God whom his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feared, as in his whole life, ſo eſpecially at that time when he had newly bleſſed him; <hi>Iſaac</hi> calling to minde that God had given the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſaying, <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve the younger,</hi> and that he had care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly and fondly gone about to transferre the bleſſing to <hi>Eſau,</hi> out of his carnall indulgence unto him becauſe he was the elder, was much afraid to think what a ſin he had committed againſt God, and ſo was reſtrained from being bold to perſiſt in that carnall purpoſe, but ſubmitting his will to Gods, he ratifies that bleſſing, which he had ignorantly pronounced, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.20. that <hi>by faith he bleſſed</hi> Eſau <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>as concerning things to come.</hi> It was faith that wrought this feare in him, and made him reſolute in the bleſſing given to <hi>Iacob:</hi> the ſtory of this feare you ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.33. <hi>he trembled exceedingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it is a good thing to have ſuch an high and reverent eſteeme of Gods greatneſſe, as to make us even tremble very much, when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive wee have offended him in going about to doe things contrary to his will, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> had in attempting to bleſſe <hi>Eſau,</hi> which now hee bethought himſelfe of, when God had unwittingly directed the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to <hi>Iacob</hi> which himſelfe intended to miſplace. This is a proofe of a ſoft and tender heart, and of an heart uprightly diſpoſed to ſerve God. It is a fruit of a good conſcience, to check us for ſin and ſtirre up feare in us when we have done amiſſe, ſo as to ſtop us from proceeding in our ſinnes.</p>

            <p>The laſt thing to be noted in <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. He obeyed the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God.</note> was his obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God given him by viſion, ſpoken of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.6 the ſtory runneth thus, there was in his daies a great famine in <hi>Canaan, Abraham</hi> had gone downe to <hi>Egypt</hi> to ſojourne therein a time of dearth, for it ſeemes to have beene a place of more conſtant plenty then <hi>Canaan, Iſaac</hi> had in his minde ſome thoughts of imitating his Father, God ſaw it not fit for him to travell thither, and therefore God appeared to him in ſome viſion and bad him not to deſcend into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but to dwell or ſojourne in that land, and promiſeth him a bleſſing; accordingly <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſtoppeth his journey, continues in <hi>Gerar,</hi> and goeth not downe to <hi>Egypt.</hi> This was an act of true obedience, hee would not goe to the place which God forbad him to go too, though it might ſeeme to have beene fitter for his profit and advantage at that time.</p>
            <p>We alſo Brethren, muſt learne to dwell where God would have us, and not to make worldly profit, pleaſure, eaſe or the like, the chooſers of our habitation; yea we muſt learne univerſall obedience, for if in point of habitation I muſt follow God then in all other things beſides. See what God ſaith in his Word unto us (and that is now inſteede of all viſions, therein now he maketh himſelfe to appeare unto us) doe ſuch or ſuch a thing, doe not ſuch or ſuch a thing, promiſing a bleſſing as alwaies he doth unto the obedient. We muſt not conſult with fleſh and bloud, nor aske counſell of profit and pleaſure, but muſt reſigne our ſelves to his Commandement, and inſtantly ſet about the one and relinquiſh the other. He that is ſo diſpoſed, he is an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> let him take comfort, he is a true beleever and a godly man, but he that in ſuch caſe refuſeth to obey, and will rather condeſcend to his carnall reaſon, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from loſſe or commodity, danger or ſafety or the like, how can hee call himſelfe an obedient childe? He that refuſeth the plaine directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods Word for earthly reſpects, is not one of the race of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> He that cauſeth all ſuch reſpect to ſtand bare unto Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

and to give way unto it, his heart is upright with God, and he is a holy man as was <hi>Iſaac.</hi> And ſo much for this good mans carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God.</p>

            <p>You ſee, how children ſhould yeeld to their Parents in all things in the Lord. It was extraordinary, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt yeeld to be ſlaine when God would have it ſo, and had extraordinarily required it.

But if in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Commandement, obedience muſt be given to Parents in ſuch an extraordinary thing, then without doubt in every ordinary thing a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent muſt be obeyed in all things in the Lord, even though the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement ſhould be ſo heavie as death it ſelfe would not be heavier. The Apoſtle hath ſaid,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.1.</note> 
               <hi>Obey your Parents in all things in the Lord, and this is well pleaſing to God, and this is juſt.</hi>

            <p>But I beſeech you repent of this ſinne, and prevent this judgement, and now let all children be followers of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> acknowledge your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

Doe it I ſay, the great benefits you have received of them requireth it, you have your very being from them in your hild-hoods education, and the Law of God requireth the ſame of you, which requireth all reaſonable things, and you cannot elſe be ſaved at laſt, for he that obeyes not that Parent whom he ſees daily, how ſhall he obey him whom hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw?</p>
            <p>And all you dutifull children, be encouraged, praiſe God that hath bound your hearts to reſpect your Parents, and intreate him to continue the ſame affection in you ſtill, and know that the Lord will bleſſe you as he bleſſed <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and will raiſe you good <hi>Iacobs</hi> to require your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſiveneſſe to your <hi>Abrahams.</hi>

            <p>But <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſubmitted himſelfe to his Father in another thing,<note place="margin">2. Was ruled by him in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> even when he was now growne to be about forty yeares of age, he gave himſelfe over to his Father to be ruled by him in marriage, he did not ſet his affections upon any woman without his conſent, nor draw away any womans affections, nor married any without the liking and privity of his Father, but took the right and due courſe, gave up himſelfe to his Fathers authority and direction, and therefore God gave him a good <hi>Rebekah</hi> indeed, a comfortable wife and vertuous woman.</p>
            <p>In this therefore all children are bound alſo to imitate him,<note place="margin">Children ſhould not marrie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents conſent.</note> Children muſt take their Parents counſell and direction in matter of marriage, and not beſtow themſelves without their good liking and conſent, that they may have Gods bleſſing attending them in their marriage, when they honour at once both God and their Parents, in obeying Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and ſhewing due reſpect unto their Parents. So did even <hi>Iſhmael</hi> though otherwiſe a wilde man, for it is ſaid of him,<note place="margin">Gen. 21.21.</note> that <hi>his Mother tooke him a wife</hi> So did <hi>Iacob</hi> afterwards, His Father <hi>bleſſed him and ſent him to</hi> Padan Aram <hi>to take him a wife of the daughters of</hi> Laban <hi>his Mothers brother.</hi>

And to whom muſt the children goe for comfort and helpe in caſe that any croſſe befall them in marriage but onely to their Parents? of which comfort and helpe they deprive themſelves if they venture upon marriage without them: wee know that thoſe God hath not joyned in marriage, whom he doth not unite in that eſtate. Now God hath made the Parents his Deputies in this behalfe, ſaying unto them, <hi>give your daughters in marriage and take ſonnes for your daughters,</hi> and againe, <hi>you ſhall not give your daughters to them in marriage, nor take their ſonnes to your daughters.</hi> Now how can it be ſaid that God joyned them? if their Parents whom hee hath made rulers over them in his ſteed do not joyne them, ſeeing immediately hee doth joyne none in theſe our daies. Alſo the children are the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:27208:140"/>
goods of the Parents as a part of their poſſeſſion, inſomuch that they were alſo to be ſold to pay their debts. Wherefore as no bargaine is firme in other kindes of goods without the conſent of thoſe that have right unto thoſe goods, ſo neither can this covenant be good without the conſent of Parents, which have as much right from God in their children as in any other of their goods.</p>
            <p>Wherefore thoſe ſonnes and daughters are much to be blamed who have neglected this part of their duty to their Parents, and have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their blinde and ſtrong paſſions ſo farre to tranſport them, that againſt their Parents conſent and counſell they have beſtowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Matrimony, and ſo have tranſgreſſed againſt the plaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God. Such muſt heartily repent of their ſinne and humble themſelves before God with much ſorrow for their great and wilfull diſobedience. Parents would not have their children thus to ſlight and diſhonour them, yea they take it grievouſly and are much perplexed with ſorrow for their children, in this caſe therefore chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould bee much grieved themſelves, if they have given this occaſion of griefe unto their Parents. To ſatisfie mens owne deſires and affections without regard to Gods ordinances, is a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſobedience and bringeth the guilt of a great offence upon the ſoules of them that have ſo offended.</p>
            <p>All you that have married in this diſorderly manner, ſee that you doe unfaignedly repent of the ſinne before God, and confeſſing the fault before him, ſeeke to prevent the curſe that muſt elſe fall upon you and your children after you for ſo diſhonouring your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>And you young men and women that be not yet married, ſee that you binde your conſciences and reſolve your wills to obey this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. Follow God in your Parents, and be not ſo raſh and ſelfe-willed as to croſſe them and follow your owne heads and paſſions. This duty will be eaſie, if you looke carefully to your paſſions at firſt and ſuffer them not to be undiſcreetely fixed upon any perſon, untill you have acquainted your Parents with your deſires, and crav'd their allowance and conſent. But if a man or maide doe inthrall themſelves and intangle others by a diſorderly placing of their affections, then ſhall they make this otherwiſe eaſie duty hard and impoſſible to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Keepe your ſelves therefore Maſters of your owne hearts and ſell not away your liberty through an over-haſty yeelding of your ſelves to your unruly paſſions. Suffer not your mindes to be drawne away by any meanes, but pray God to keepe your hearts in order. It is a ſinfull love as well as a ſinfull paſſion in any other kinde, which troubles an houſe and makes the children contrary to their Parents, and to proove the greateſt croſſe that may be to them, to whom they ought to have beene the greateſt comfort.</p>

He hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Rebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kahs</hi> wiſe counſell.</note> and when ſhe complained of <hi>Eſaus</hi> wives evill and froward behaviour, telling how bitter her life would prove if <hi>Iacob</hi> alſo ſhould bring in ſuch ill nurtured wives, he ſends him away according to her deſire, to take a wife in <hi>Padan-aram:</hi> So ſhould every good man be ready to hearken to his wives advice and counſell, and to gratifie her in thoſe things that are fit, not to croſſe and contradict her. This is a part of due kindneſſe to your wives, ſee that you neglect it not to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of mutuall and continuall diſcord betwixt you.</p>
            <p>So have we conſidered <hi>Iſaacs</hi> good carriage towards God and his parents, Father and mother, and towards his wife; hee was a parent and had children, even two ſonnes <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> Now he bleſſed both of them, and that out of Faith:<note place="margin">7. Hee bleſſed his children out of faith. Heb. 11.20.</note> for his bleſſing was not a bare wiſhing and praying for a bleſſing upon them, but a propheticall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of a bleſſing in Godsname, whereof if he had not received a promiſe from God, and alſo beleeved that promiſe, neither he nor his children would have made ſo great account of it. All of us cannot bleſſe our children in this manner, for the gift of prophecie is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto us, but all of us muſt in Faith bleſſe our children, that is, pray for a bleſſing at Gods hand upon our ſeede as well as our ſelves. Yea wee muſt all apply our ſelves to the ſincere obedience which hath an ample promiſe of bleſſing annexed, and cannot faile to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a bleſſing, ſince God will not faile to fulfill his word. Why is a propheticall bleſſing of ſome valew? ſurely, becauſe it is a certaine thing, as having its originall in Gods fidelity, who having ſaid it ſhall be ſo, muſt either accompliſh it with his hand, or elſe falſifie his word, which is impoſſible. Now it is as impoſſible, that God ſhould neglect to keepe his promiſe as to fulfill his predictions; wherefore ſeeing all bleſſings are plentifully promiſed to him that walketh before God uprightly and conſtantly, doe this O yee Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, this is to bleſſe your childeren in faith, but if you follow your owne hearts and leave the wayes of God, and goe forward in pathes of impiety and unrighteouſneſſe, then doe you curſe your ſelves and your children, and worſe then pronounce a curſe, even pull downe a curſe upon your ſelves and them.</p>
            <p>Further,<note place="margin">8. He confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall bleſſing upon <hi>Iacob</hi> to whom God had given it.</note> 
               <hi>Iſaac</hi> did conferre the principall bleſſing upon <hi>Iacob</hi> to whom God had given it, even that bleſſing which contayned in it, the cauſing of Chriſt the promiſed ſeede to come from his loynes, the Church to continue in his poſterity, and ſpirituall benefits to belong to him and them. There was a time when <hi>Iſaac</hi> out of heede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſſe or forgetfulneſſe, or ſome other carnall conſideration, was minded to have ſetled this ſpeciall bleſſing upon <hi>Eſau,</hi> but being made to perceive that he had offended therein and gone againſt the will of God, he returned to a right courſe, and calling <hi>Iacob</hi> whom
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:27208:142"/>
he had unwittingly bleſſed before thinking him to be <hi>Eſau,</hi> hee now againe wittingly and willingly bleſſeth under his owne name and in his owne perſon. Parents have not now the beſtowing of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bleſſing upon children as then <hi>Iſaac</hi> had it miniſterially, but all parents ſhould chiefely labour to intereſt their children in it. For what will it availe to have the fat of the earth and dew of Heaven, if wee goe without the favour of God in Chriſt? And when any Father perceives that God hath vouchſafed to any of their children this ſpirituall bleſſing, in that they be made carefull to ſerve, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and obey him as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, theſe muſt inherit their affections more plentifully then others of their children in whom ſuch grace is wanting. The image of God muſt over-rule our affections, not carnall things, as at length it did <hi>Iſaacs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have ſhewed what was good in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in reſpect of thoſe that were of his owne family, for wee reade not of any ſpeciall point in his carriage to ſervants. See now what a one hee was to his neighbours farther of. Firſt to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> then to the men of <hi>Gerar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Abimelech,</hi> hee had wronged him in affirming his wife to be his ſiſter. <hi>Abimelech</hi> by ſeeing ſome familiar carriage betwixt them, was induced to be fully perſwaded that ſhe was his wife, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cals him, and begins to reprove him for it. <hi>Iſaac</hi> maketh no defence at all for himſelfe, but by his ſilence accepts the reproofe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his fault.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">He accepted <hi>Abimelechs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note>It is a good thing when we have done amiſſe and are charged with it, at leaſt to refraine our tongues from denying, defending, excuſing and the like, and at leaſt by not gaine-ſaying, to make it appeare that wee pleaſe not our ſelves ſtill in the ſame offence. Indeede a plaine acknowledging is the beſt of all, but a not gaine-ſaying, not ſhifting, not winding out by words is at leaſt neceſſary. It were a grace to a number, if they had a minde ſo willing to mend, that they might not have a tongue ready to ſpeake againſt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</p>
            <p>But further, <hi>Abimelech</hi> came to him after to make a covenant with him, bringing alone his chiefe officer and ſpeciall favourite. Though <hi>Abimelech</hi> had beene ſomewhat diſcourteous to <hi>Abraham</hi> before, and had chaſed him away from him, yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> is not ſo farre leavened with diſcontent as to reject <hi>Abimelechs</hi> motion, but having gently minded him of that unkindneſſe, is yet ready to imbrace his offer of amity. Why be not wee all of a like mind in this matter? to paſſe by unkindneſſes quickly, and be never a whit the leſſe forward to any good office of love, becauſe we have met with ſome very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loving paſſages from the ſame men before. It is a fruite of wiſedome and charity to cover wrongs as from others by forbearing to blaze them abroad, ſo from ones ſelfe, by forbearing to call them to minde, ſo as to be eſtranged from him that hath offered them, and made leſſe forward to interchange amity with him afterwards. But
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:27208:142"/>
hee hath little either love or humility or diſcretion, that knowes not how to keepe downe the thought of an injury, but that it makes him ſtill averſe from offering or accepting curteſies from the authors of it.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Iſaac</hi> made <hi>Abimelech</hi> and his company a feaſt.<note place="margin">10. He made <hi>Abimelech</hi> and his company a feaſt.</note> It is fit to uſe good hoſpitality, and with liberall entertainement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe that have occaſion to come unto us according to their places, <hi>Abraham</hi> did this before. This degree of hoſpitality hath beene found in Heathens to their commendation; but the beſt hoſpitality is that, which entertaines the poore that are never likely to be able to make amends. God will become pay-maſter of that coſt which the poore is not able to requite.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Iſaac</hi> had ſomething to doe with the men of <hi>Gerar,</hi> for they contended with him unjuſtly for divers Wells of water which his ſervants had digged, and hee patiently yeelds to them and will not make a brawle of it. It behooveth us to ſhew the like moderation, and not to be fierce in ſtriving againſt them which will needs be unjuſt in ſtriving againſt us.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Iſaacs</hi> eſtate, he was a good husband, dug Welles,<note place="margin">11. He was a good husband</note> ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed corne, and ſo increaſed his eſtate through Gods bleſſing upon his diligence.</p>
            <p>Good husbandry is a thing commendable among all men as well as pleaſing to God, it hath the promiſe of ſufficiency of maintenance an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it for incouragement. We muſt every man with ſo much diligence and diſcretion order our eſtate, that wee may become ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of abundance and may not deprive our ſelves of ſo comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thing as plenty is. Onely in our labour, let us looke that wee be moderate, that exceſſive labouring about earthly buſineſſes doe not induce a neglect of thoſe things that concerne a better life, let your chiefe care be for Heavenly things, and yet neglect not theſe temporary in their places: but hee that through unthriftineſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does or hinders himſelfe, how can we conceive that he ſhall be wiſe enough to ſeeke ſpirituall things, that hath no wit to get tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall?</p>
            <p>Againe, when <hi>Iſaac</hi> digged a Well,<note place="margin">12. He made a ſpirituall uſe of earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</note> for which at length the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines contended not with him, hee called the name of it <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>now the Lord hath made roome for us and wee ſhall increaſe in the earth, Gen.</hi> 26.22. taking notice of Gods goodneſſe, in the quiet enjoyment of that benefit, and by faith perſwading himſelfe of Gods bleſſing upon him, and ſo not carnally but ſpiritually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the temporall benefit.</p>
            <p>Ah that wee could make to our ſelves a ſpirituall uſe of earthly commodities as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to ſee God in them with thankefullneſſe, and to learne to depend upon him for proſperity and not upon our owne indeavours; and in particular, that if God grant us quietneſſe, and reſtraine men from contending and quarrelling with us, ſo that wee have peace in our houſes, we could then give praiſe to him, and take
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:27208:143"/>
comfort in him and repoſe our confidence in him. The ſight of God in outward things is infinitely more comfortable, then the things themſelves how great ſoever they be.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His faults.</note>And thus much of <hi>Iſaacs</hi> vertues; ſome faults he had too which wee muſt looke upon to reforme in our ſelves, not to imitate, for it is a childiſh folly to follow after thoſe that goe before us, though they runne thorough puddles: <hi>Iſaacs</hi> faults were ſome in reſpect of God, ſome in reſpect of man, <hi>viz.</hi> his ſonnes and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> and ſome in reſpect of himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. He forgat the Word of God.</note>As for God, he ſinned ſurely, in forgetting himſelfe ſo farre as to reſolve in his minde to bleſſe his ſonne <hi>Eſau,</hi> whereas God had ſaid, <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> He ſhould have beene mindfull of that propheticall anſwer, which was given concerning thoſe two ſonnes, even when they ſtrove in their Mothers wombes: unleſſe wee ſhall ſay, that the whole paſſage was ſo carried as it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from <hi>Iſaac:</hi> but that is nothing probable, it can hardly be conceived that <hi>Rebekah</hi> would not acquaint her husband, both that ſhee felt ſo ſtrange a ſtriving in her wombe, (which made her ſeeke to God to know the matter) as alſo what anſwer ſhee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from God. Taking that for granted which is ſo probable, that there is no reaſon to doubt of it, I ſay wee may note a fault in good <hi>Iſaac,</hi> yea good old <hi>Iſaac,</hi> hee forgate the Word of God which had beene ſpoken ſome yeares before, and that ſo ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, as hee determined to have croſſed it and gone directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
            <p>It is a fault from which the bed men alive are not exempted, even ſo to forget Gods Word, as to be ready out of forgetfullneſſe to tranſgreſſe it. This forgetfullneſſe ariſeth many times from heede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, and many times from continuance and length of time, and ſometimes from very ſtrength of paſſion and diſtemper, which doth caſt out the remembrance of good things from the minde. <hi>David</hi> and all the Prieſts had forgotten that which at leaſt ſome of them had read concerning the not carting of Gods Arke, but carrying it upon the Prieſts ſhoulders; <hi>Iacob</hi> after had little leſſe then forgate the vow hee made unto God in his affliction. I pray you take heed of ſuch forgetfullneſſe, meditate often that you may remember ſeaſonably, pray God to write his Lawes in your hearts, and to make his holy Spirit to become your remembrancer, that your knowledge be not made unprofitable through forgetfullneſſe, for that which is not fitly called to minde is in a manner as if it were not. And if you meete with ſuch a weakeneſſe as this in your ſelves, looke that you be duely abaſed in the ſight of it, but be not out of heart as if you were deſtitute of all grace, becauſe you are imperfect in it, but take comfort to ſeeke and hope for pardon upon your humble confeſſion, when the Lord pleaſeth to put you in remembrance againe. If <hi>Peter</hi> had remembred Chriſts words before, hee might perhaps have eſcaped his great ſinne of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:27208:143"/>
denying his Maſter, but hee remembred it after to make him weepe bitterly. It were a comfortable thing to call to minde thoſe things that ſhould preſerve us from ſinne ſo timely, that we might be ſo preſerved by them. But if wee have done otherwiſe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveth us to put our ſelves in minde of them after to worke godly ſorrow, and then turning to God wee muſt not ſuffer our ſelves to doubt, but that hee will vouchſafe to accept us.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Iſaac</hi> offended ſomething againſt men.<note place="margin">2. Hee loved <hi>Eſau</hi> better then <hi>Iacob,</hi> and that for carnall reſpects.</note> In reſpect of his two ſonnes, at firſt he loved <hi>Eſau</hi> better then <hi>Iacob</hi> and that for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſpects, becauſe <hi>Eſau</hi> by his hunting ſupplied him with ſuch kinde of meate as was contentfull to him. It was without doubt a weakeneſſe in him and deſerveth taxing. Should <hi>Iſaac</hi> beare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to a graceleſſe ſonne for veniſons ſake, rather then to a godly ſonne for vertue ſake? Should our paſſions, fancies, appetites car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie us away and over-rule our affections. Surely as <hi>David</hi> wiſhed thoſe that feared God to come unto him, and he would chooſe them for his companions; ſo ſhould every man make godlineſſe the rule of his affections, ſo as when other things be even to give piety the preheminence, and cauſe godlineſſe to caſt the ſcale as it were. It is a fault in any man to love a worſe childe above a better for any ſiniſter reſpect, <hi>Abraham</hi> loved not <hi>Iſhmael</hi> above <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that it may be thought, that God commanded <hi>Iſhmael</hi> to be caſt out, that hee might not be thought a meete perſon at leaſt to partake with <hi>Iſaac</hi> in his inheritance. And as to be carried away in our affections to children (by affecting them moſt that deſerve it leaſt) in carnall reſpects is a ſinne, ſo likewiſe towards other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alſo, ſervants, neighbours or any other. Therefore hee that hath done ſo or findes himſelfe ſo inclined, muſt be humbled in his folly and labour at laſt to rectifie his love, as wee ſhew'd you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> did when God diſcovered his weakeneſſe to him.</p>
            <p>Now in reſpect of <hi>Abimelech,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. He did lie out of feare.</note> 
               <hi>Iſaac</hi> offended by lying out of feare, when the men of <hi>Gerar</hi> began to queſtion with him about his wife, he began to ſuſpect, that they meant no good in ſuch inquirie, and fearing ſome ill uſage from them if hee ſhould have profeſſed himſelfe her husband, helped the matter with a ſudden lie, and ſaid ſhee was his Siſter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.7. you ſee hee inheriteth here his Fathers carnall feare, and carnall ſhift, of lying to prevent the evill feared. Here wee have two plaine faults, his immoderate feare, and his lying to helpe himſelfe at a pinch; to be afraid of death ſo that there appeare ſome likelihood that it will come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us ſuddenly and violently, we ſuffer our ſelves to be drawne into ſinne for the eſcaping of it, is a ſin and ſuch a ſin it is, as hath often diſcovered it ſelfe in good men. Wee noted it in <hi>Abraham</hi> twice upon the ſame occaſion that is here mentioned; So it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell <hi>David,</hi> when hee came firſt to <hi>Achiſh</hi> King of <hi>Gath,</hi> ſo to <hi>Peter</hi> and others. The inordinateneſſe of the feare of death ariſeth
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:27208:144"/>
from weakeneſſe of faith, both in that a man doth not ſo ſtedfaſtly rely upon God for defence and ſafeguard of life, as alſo for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſoule after death, or becauſe hee is not ſo well verſed in the meditations of death and Heaven, as to become ſufficiently heavenly-minded. For if wee did fully perſwade our ſelves that God would ſtand by us in perill, that hee would be our ſhield and buckler, then it would befall us according to that of <hi>David, The Lord is on my ſide,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 118.6.</note> 
               <hi>I will not feare what man can doe unto mee;</hi> but in the beſt this confidence is often weakened, and they are taken unprovided through the ſuddenneſſe of the danger, or the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, or it is likely that the ſoule which ſo feareth death, as by ſinne to ſhun the ſame, doth not ſo thoroughly aſſure it ſelfe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or hath not ſo clearely and fully apprehended the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſalvation; for doubtleſſe death would be welcome to him rather then terrible, that did apprehend it as a darke entrie leading to the glorious palace of glory, and had well conſidered of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that glory.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you take paines to helpe your ſelves againſt the feare of death, and to worke in your hearts ſo truly couragious a temper, that though it ſhould preſent it ſelfe to you naked and without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, and that ſuddenly, and that in ſhew unpreventably, yet you might be ſo conſtant and ſo ſetled as not to betake your ſelves unto any ſinfull meanes of eſcape, but rather chooſe to die then to ſinne againſt God, as knowing death to be no great matter, but ſinne to be an hatefull thing and worſe by farre then death. And how ſhould this undaunted and ſpirituall fortitude be attained but by converſing with death often in your thoughts? ſo as to get ſome good aſſurance, that it ſhall not be able to carry you to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of darkneſſe to eternall death, but alone to let you out of this dungeon into a roome farre more lightſome and blisfull. He that thinkes much of death, ſo as to make himſelfe carefull by frequent renewing of his repentance and amendment of his life, to get his ſalvation aſſured to himſelfe, ſhall at laſt be happily armed againſt the feare of death, and ſhall be made ſo reſolute as to chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die then ſinne.</p>
            <p>Againe, if you finde ſo much weakeneſſe in any of Gods Saints with whom you live, as you finde recorded in the ſtory of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> I pray you be no harſher ſo them then you be to him. Tell mee what thinke you of <hi>Iſaac?</hi> was hee a godly man or not? if you ſay no, you contradict the Scripture, if you ſay yea, then you muſt learne not to deny to another the name of a good man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you meete with the like diſorders in him that are here noted in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> if hee feare too much, if hee hath uſed ſome ſinfull meanes to eſcape death or other danger. Nay a man ought not to deny himſelfe the name of a man truly ſanctified, becauſe hee findeth the ſame imperfections in himſelfe. To call in queſtion ones being ſanctified in reſpect of the hanging on of ſuch weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:27208:144"/>
is to nip and diſcourage the worke of grace, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the growth of it no leſſe then a cold froſt doth hinder fruites from growing.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Iſaac</hi> telleth a manifeſt lie. Lying is a ſinne, and <hi>the lying tongue will bring deſtruction;</hi> but to bee ſo tranſported with ſome preſent paſſion, as to be thruſt into the mire of lying is ſuch a thing as may befall a godly man. Come and take heede, that you doe not imbolden your ſelves to lie by abuſing this and the like Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but rather reſolve and pray againſt it, as knowing in how much danger you ſtand of falling into it. For though to bee over-taken with this ſinne in haſt, doe not diſproove the truth of ſanctity; yet to be a lier (one that makes account that this is ſo ſmall an offence, that hee will not be ſo preciſe as to forbeare to helpe himſelfe by it if need be) this is a proofe of a man that hath not yet gotten any ſanctity. Lying is a ſinne ſo plaine, that ſcarce is it poſſible to be ignorant of it, but through wilfullneſſe, becauſe a man refuſeth to be willing to know that fault which hee is not willing to leave. For no man can chooſe but blame it in another, and therefore his inward ſoule doth plainely tell him that it is alſo naught in himſelfe. Now to live purpoſely in a knowne ſinne, reſolving that hee muſt and will doe it if occaſion ſerve, this is to be a worker of iniquity. Remember therefore the word of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.25.</note> 
               <hi>Put away lying ſeeing you have put off the old man,</hi> intimating that hee hath not caſt off any, part of the old man, that hath not throwne away this rag of it. Lying will breed boldneſſe to ſinne, hard-heartedneſſe in it, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency after it. Therefore you muſt determinately conclude with your ſelves, <hi>to put away lying and ſpeake the truth one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> In theſe two things <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſinned againſt GOD and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But his ſinne againſt <hi>Abimelech</hi> was,<note place="margin">4. He ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zed <hi>Abimelech.</hi>
               </note> in that hee was like to have drawne him occaſionally into a great ſinne, hee did that which might eaſily have hazarded him to thinke of making <hi>Rebekah</hi> his wife, that is, of committing adultery. It is a ſinne to become a ſtumbling blocke to another by doing that which may make him bold to doe a thing that is ſinfull, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> complained to <hi>Abraham</hi> and alſo to <hi>Iſaac;</hi> take heede that you become not ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blockes in a more palpable faſhion, by inticing, perſwading, exhorting, giving evill example or the like. Be carefull not to partake with other mens ſinnes, and if you can call to minde any thing done by your ſelves in the like nature, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch an act as might have pulled another to wickedneſſe, though the ill effect have not followed, yet you muſt repent of your uncharitableneſſe and raſhneſſe herein.</p>
            <p>Another fault of <hi>Iſaacs</hi> is this,<note place="margin">5. He loved good fare too much.</note> that he had too great reſpect to good fare, he loved his tooth and palate a little too much, he was an aged man and hee gave himſelfe a little more then enough to ſavoury meate, and his love to good fare carried him ſo farre awry in his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:27208:145"/>
affections, that he loved <hi>Eſau</hi> more then <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 25.28. Surely, it was too great a love to Veniſon, that cauſed him to love a worſe ſonne above a better. This is a weakeneſſe againſt which it is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſtrive, our ſenſuality inclineth us unto it, wee are apt to thinke it no ſinne, may not a man uſe Gods benefits and enjoy the comforts of this life in good meaſure? why ſhould not hee fare well that hath much given him by God? But ſure to be ſo over-ruled by ones palate, that any diſorders be bred thence in ones life towards any perſon or thing, cannot but be a ſinne for all theſe excuſes. Doe not wee know that cockering of the body doth likely depreſſe the ſoule? and the feeding of the belly and pleaſing of the taſte doth breed an aptneſſe to be leſſe delighted with better things.</p>
            <p>Thus you have <hi>Iſaacs</hi> faults. Firſt, Forgetfulneſſe of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Secondly, Carnall feare of death. Thirdly, Lying to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent danger. Fourthly, Scandalizing <hi>Abimelech.</hi> Fiftly, over-loving his worſer ſonne, and Sixtly, Over-loving good fare. We will goe on now to conſider what bleſſings he enjoyed.</p>

It is a ſingular favour of God, to give a man ſpirituall bleſſings, to make him his childe, to appeare to him and comfort him, by giving him aſſurance that hee is his childe, and confirme his Faith in his gracious promiſes. This is the greateſt favour, to bleſſe us with ſpirituall bleſſings, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> had the terrene, but <hi>Iſaac</hi> had the ſpirituall bleſſings, theſe were given alſo to <hi>Iacob</hi> as a ſingular prerogative. It is an admirable favour indeede to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy theſe, for they will not ceaſe at the end of this life, but will continue till another life and will bee perfected in another life eternally.</p>
            <p>I pray you conſider whether God have vouchſafed theſe unto you, hath he cauſed you to feare his name? hath he made you to beleeve his promiſes? hath he appeared to you in his word and ordinances? and given you ſome happy apprehenſion of his goodneſſe in Chriſt, making you know, that he will fulfill to you the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham.</hi> If he have, give hearty praiſes to him, take unſpeakable comfort in him, account all your other croſſes nothing. Rejoyce in him ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, that hath tranſlated you from the power of darkeneſſe to his owne Kingdome. Happy is he that is made the childe of God, though he be in great calamity for outward things. Know the incomparable greatneſſe of his favour, that you may rejoyce in it, in deſpight of all croſſes. And labour to get more and more aſſurance of your intereſt unto God and happy eſtate this way, that you may be more and more comforted. But if you have not theſe ſpirituall good things, doe not account your ſelves happy, becauſe of the outward, thinke not that you are in a good eſtate whatſoever you poſſeſſe, if you poſſeſſe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:27208:145"/>
not Gods Spirit to make you Gods childe, to ſeale you to the day of redemption, to comfort you in all times, with making himſelfe more and more aſſuredly knowne unto you. What is it to enjoy a dreame of proſperity in this ſleepe of naturall life? and then to ſpend ones eternall being in endleſſe and irremediable and unſufferable miſery. Reſt not your ſelves ſatisfied in outward things, count not your ſelves happy in having them, never thinke you have any thing till you have grace, till you have Chriſt, till you have intereſt into Heaven, that eternall land of promiſe, and ſet your ſelves in feeling of the want of theſe things to ſeeke them in Gods ordinances. Prayer, the Word, Sacraments, and you ſhall have them, for you want them not that live in the Church, but for want of care duely to ſeeke them.</p>

Hath not hee given ſome of you good and godly children, at leaſt ſome, or one, and the reſt civill and thriving? Hath not he given you a wealthy eſtate? not ſo rich as <hi>Iſaac</hi> but even rich enough, I meane ſo much as will inable you to enjoy your ſelves in the world, and to paſſe thorough the world with comfort. Hath not he proſpered the worke of your hands? and given you roomth, and

If ſo, let theſe benefits become matter of praiſe, let them become arguments of obedience, labour to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thankfull for them, that you may finde them truly beneficiall: make a ſpirituall uſe of temporall bleſſings.</p>
            <p>And if any want theſe things, let him ſee how rich God is, and let him even truſt in him for ſufficiency in outward things, and count it enough that it pleaſeth God to give him better things as I exhorted before. And if any of Gods people finde not theſe things ſo granted to himſelfe, let him not take Gods dealing with him in the worſt part, let him not aſcribe it to want of love to him, but to his wiſedome, that ſeeing him not ſo capable of theſe things, doth withdraw from him that thing which hee ſees would be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto him. Wee muſt not miſconſter Gods forbearing to give outward things. Yea now let all men encourage themſelves to bee obedient to God, and to feare him as did <hi>Iſaac,</hi> for you ſee in him that God is ready to reward his ſervants with great commodities and comforts in this life too. Hee will not alone ſave them, but ſo farre as is good, make their eſtate proſperous here below. That godlineſſe which hath the promiſe ſhall alſo have the performance of good things for this preſent life and that which is to come.

               <note place="margin">1. He was long blinde.</note>For his body, hee was blinde many yeares, for hee was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at forty, at ſixty hee had <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob; Iacob</hi> was about ſeventy ſix yeares when he came to <hi>Laban,</hi> ſo then <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty ſixe yeares, and at that time hee could not diſcerne <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> one from the other by ſight, and he lived in all 180 yeares, from which if you ſubtract 136, then will remaine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foure yeares, ſo long did <hi>Iſaac</hi> live without the uſe of his eyes. Therefore learne you to bee thankefull that God hath given you your eye-ſight even to your lives end, ſo that you want not this ſence at all till death, or at leaſt want it not ſo long a ſpace of time. Sight is a great comfort, it is pleaſant to ſee the Sunne and to bee able with our eyes to behold and diſcerne our friends and all other creatures of GOD. Let us praiſe God for the uſe of this and other ſences.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let us prepare to ſuffer the ſame croſſe, who can tell how ſoone his eyes may grow dimme? let us uſe them well whileſt wee have them, and withdraw them from looking after
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:27208:146"/>
vanity, and all other abuſes: for nothing will grieve us more when wee have loſt them, then that wee have abuſed them, nor comfort us more, then to remember that wee have kept them in order and beſtowed them holily. And indeed, they bee things apt to bee abuſed a 1000 waies; Prevent all theſe abuſes and put on a contented minde, if God ſee it fit to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of them, getting ſuch a cleareneſſe of inward ſight, that the comfort of that may ſupply the want of outward eyes. Hee that hath an underſtanding given him to ſee God and Chriſt, to ſee Heaven and things ſpirituall, may eaſily miſſe the ſight of other things; but ah how comfortleſſe is a blind body joyned with a blind minde? Take heed that this great darkeneſſe fall not upon you, for what can this bee but even a fore-runner of utter and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting darkeneſſe.</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>Iſaac</hi> in his ſtate met with divers croſſes,<note place="margin">2.

            <p>Prepare your ſelves therefore to be envied and wronged, and to have enemies that will contend and quarrell with you cauſeleſly, and be carefull to get Gods favour, that the malice and injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men may not be able to hurt you, but that God may bleſſe you the more, by how much men doe more envie you, wrong you and contend againſt you, as it befell to <hi>Iſaac.</hi> For God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered him and comforted him the more, by how much the world did more grudge at him, and ſeeke to diſquiet him. Labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to get Gods favour, that you may have a patient, a cheerefull minde the in middeſt of the greateſt injuries. In the meane time, expect ſuch evill uſage and ſtrive to be able to beare it without vexation and diſcontent, which are things more troubleſome then the croſſes themſelves.</p>
            <p>Further, learne to be thankfull to God, if hee have pleaſed to keepe you from ſpight, wrong and ſtrife, that either you bee not envied, or elſe thoſe that envie you have not had ability to wrong you and contend againſt you. It is a great goodneſſe of God ſo to hedge about a mans eſtate, that no man hath beene able to breake in upon him to hurt him, and it is neither mens wit nor greatneſſe that can procure unto them this ſafety, but it is God alone that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to dwell in ſafety. Let our hearts be lifted up to praiſe him, that hath ſo incompaſſed us with his favour as with a ſhield.</p>
            <p>But next, <hi>Iſaac</hi> was croſſed in his children. Firſt,<note place="margin">3.

            <p>Learne to beare with patience Gods deferring of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and not to let your hopes ſlip, but ſtill to truſt on God and waite for him, who will come in due time though hee ſatisfie not our haſtie and over-eager deſires. Hold to the promiſe of God, it ſhall be fulfilled at length though wee bee made to tarry ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what long for it, that wee may bee better fitted to receive it with thankefullneſſe. The longer a good thing is deſired and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, the more abundant comfort it yeeldeth when it is come.</p>

Learne to bee thankefull, if you have eſcaped this croſſe, and if God have provided ſuch yoake-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes for your children, as by their dutifull and loving carriage doe make the comfort of your lives more abundant, framing themſelves to content you in all good and lawfull things, as if they were your owne ſonnes or daughters: It is a great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſee ones children ſo happily matched; Let not this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit bee ſleighted and paſſed over without particular thankes. And now prepare for this croſſe, or if you bee under it, labour to beare it, ſo as not to bee made weary of life, but enjoy the reſt ſo thankefully, that the bitterneſſe of this may bee ſweetened and allayed. And pray to God to direct your ſelves and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſo in their choice or yours for them, that they may not ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon a torment unawares, and learne in chooſing to chooſe for grace rather then ſiniſter reſpects, ſo may you hope to bee directed aright, and to get a true benefit.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Eſau</hi> was a croſſe to his Father in his malice againſt his Brother, whom hee purpoſed to kill, and would not keepe the thought to himſelfe ſo, but that it uttered it ſelfe. If <hi>Iſaac</hi> knew not of it, hee was not afflicted with it, but if hee did, hee could not but take it heavily. Thanke God if hee have not given over your children to ſuch malice one againſt the other, and if you lie under this miſery, make it as eaſie as may bee, by telling yourſelves it was <hi>Iſaacs</hi> croſſe, and yet God kept it from ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to execution.</p>

            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Her vertues. 1. She was chaſte while a Virgin.</note> whileſt ſhe lived young in her Fathers houſe, She was a Virgin untouched by man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.16. <hi>No man knew her.</hi> It behooveth young women to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo modeſtly, and ſhamefac'dly, that they may bring themſelves unto their own husbands undefiled. Therefore the holy Ghoſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Parents to be carefull of preſerving the tokens of the maidens virginity, that they might be able to prove it againſt the ſlanders of her husbands evill tongue (if he ſhould after report that he found her not a maide) but withall he appointed that if the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could not prove her ſelfe to have been a Virgin, ſhe ſhould be brought out and publiquely ſtoned at her Fathers doore, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22, 13. You ſee that God would have the daughter put to death which ſhould be bold to proſtitute her ſelfe to any other men, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive one that had not knowne her, and thruſt her ſelfe upon him as if ſhe had been a Virgin, as much as if he had ordered that ſuch a defiled
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27208:149"/>
maiden ſhould not marry any other but him that had defiled her, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe firſt ſhe had made the matter knowne unto that other. Now what care ſhould be taken to preſerve chaſtity, the heathens may teach us, who for meere credit ſake, uſed diligence in this matter, and it ſhould be a ſhame for Chriſtians not to exceed Pagans in any point of goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore ſpeake unto you young maidens, and require you to follow <hi>Rebekkah</hi> in this kinde, keep your ſelves pure, ſuffer not your ſelves to be won away with any ſolicitations for all occaſions of ſin. Be not haughty in conceit of your own ſtrength to withſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny allurement, but feare God, and beſeech him to keep you by vertue of his feare, elſe many a boaſting maiden hath been forced out of her own experience to confeſſe, that this offence cannot be prevented by braging. I ſay therefore, let the feare of God, and an humble heart, and a carefull ſhunning of evill opportunities be the preſervers of your chaſtity. And if any of you have been corrupt, and vitiated, though it be knowne to none but God and your ſelves, ſee that you be greatly humbled, and truly penitent for it.</p>
            <p>The cuſtome of many is, if they can conceale themſelves in this kinde, and that they prove not with childe, to the publique reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves before men, not at all to grieve for the ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though it be nevertheleſſe abominable in Gods ſight, becauſe of ſuch concealing it; yea, ſome there be that adde murder alſo to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, uſing meanes of abortion to themſelves, or of hindering themſelves from conceiving, by wicked reaches, and deviſes: But the all-ſeeing eyes of God do diſcover their lewdneſſe, and will make their offences knowne to all the world, and that ſo much the more to their diſgrace, and deſtruction, by how much they have declared themſelves to be more wicked, in fearing men, and not God. Indeed if the matter come to open knowledge, they weep, and take on, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidently, that ignominy goeth nearer to their hearts than ſin, and that they care not how lewd they be, if their lewdneſſe come not to light. But I ſay, be you carefull to prevent ſecret ſins in this kinde, and tender the health of your ſoules more than the credit of your names, and undoe that ſin by unfained repentance, which will elſe make you odious to God, though you hide it never ſo cloſly from men. And let Parents alſo cary a watchfull eye upon their daughters, not giving them liberty to range up and down at unfit times, to unfit places, leſt it befall them as it did <hi>Dinah, Iacobs</hi> daughter, when ſhee gave her ſelfe leave to gaze abroad to ſee the faſhions of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the countrey. And I muſt alſo ſpeake to young men, which goe a wooing to young maidens, that they ſuffer not themſelves to be ſo far tranſported with unlawfull, and unruly deſires, as to pollute thoſe before marriage, or aſſay to ſolicite them whom they pretend to love ſo, as to make them their wives.

And ſo much for <hi>Rebekkahs</hi> chaſtity, ſhe came an unſpotted Virgin to the bed of marriage.</p>

            <p>Learne you maidens to be painfull, learne to be curteous, by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour you ſhould keep your bodies in good health, and your mindes alſo free from vices and evill deſires, and by curteſie you ſhall ſhew your ſelves to be of a good nature, willing to be ſerviceable, and ſo ſhall win love, credit, and good eſteeme: but an idle churliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that makes her ſelfe ſick by her ſloathfulneſſe, and by her back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe to do ſervice, (ſhewing that ſhe is good for nothing but to trick up, and pride her ſelfe) becomes loathſome to God and man. Be not idle, be not nice and dainty, be not ſowre and churliſh, theſe things will cauſe you to inherite as much diſgrace as <hi>Rebekkah</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite honour and good will.

This Story you may reade at large, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.15. and ſo forward reade it, conſider of it, and take it forth into your lives, and learn to live according to the worthy preſidents which the word of God commendeth unto you.

the croſſe when it comes not with a ſting upon their conſciences, in that by their ſinfulneſſe they have even pulled miſery upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. If you be well matched, the comfort will be doubled, when you ſhall perceive that it is a fruit of Gods goodneſſe unto you, in bleſſing your care of obſerving his commandements, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and if a croſſe come, it will be far more eaſily borne, when you have your parents and friends ready to comfort you, and helpe you, becauſe you have followed their directions in beſtowing your ſelves. Thus you ſhall provide beſt for your own perpetuall welfare: for that inordinate paſſion, which is called love, will ſoon be quenched like a fire of thornes, and then it is not the fulfilling of irregular deſires, that will miniſter comfort unto you. It is evident by experience, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and diſſention do quickly fall out betwixt them that followed paſſion rather then duty, and diſcretion in placing themſelves with a husband. Now you ſhall be well able thus to perform your duty both to God and your Parents, if you keep your ſelves owners of your own hearts, and ſuffer not your unruly paſſions to make you ſlaves unto themſelves, and ſo to make your duty difficult and tedious. He that keeps his feet and legs free from ſhackles and chains, can eaſily go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any buſineſſes that are needfull for him to do. But whoſoever will lade himſelf with irons and fetters, ſhall finde it grievous to ſtir when it is requiſite for him to go any whither. Therefore ſhackle not you ſoules with the chaines of unruly affections, that you may chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully yeeld your ſelves to your parents diſpoſall, as both nature and religion do require at your hands. Give not away your ſelves before hand, commit not that vile Idolatry of making ſome one man a falſe god unto you, and let not your hearts be inſlaved to any one, before your Parents have given you, who have intereſt from God to diſpoſe of you according to the rules of diſcretion for your own good. For Parents looke to the conſtant good of their children in beſtowing them, but their own green heads do likely regard nothing elſe but the pleaſing of their eye and fancies, which likely doth end in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and diſcontent. And ſo you have ſeen <hi>Rebekkahs</hi> good carriage while ſhe was a maiden, living under the government of her Eather in his Family.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

A good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought to bee prayerfull, and both to unite her devotions to her husband, and alſo to call upon God by her ſelfe alone. See there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you wives that you be ready to ſhew piety in the ſame kinde;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:27208:150"/>
pray to God with your husbands, yea pray to him for your ſelves, husbands, and children, and for all good things. The bleſſings are doubled that are gotten not alone by naturall endeavours, but by fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers unto God, for this is a proofe, that they be granted by God in favour, and ſo they become tokens of his love to men, and by that meanes are much more comfortable then of their own nature they could be. Thoſe wives therefore are too blame, that ſcarce are willing to pray themſelves, or to joyne with their husbands, but by their backwardneſſe interrupt their praying together, a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when it is procured by diſcontents, falling out betwixt, and conſequently alſo by any other meanes. Mend this fault O ye wives, and you that are husbands, if the fault have been in you, mend it, and ſee that you joyne together, calling upon God. If you have children, yet there be enough of other things for which you ought to viſite the Throne of grace. The graces of Gods Spirit are much more deſirable then the fruit of our bodies, and I am ſure that our hearts are all barren of ſuch fruit, and cannot be made fruitfull but by Gods Spirit working in our hearts, and prayer will cauſe him to make a barren heart fruitfull as well as a barren wombe, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prayer the heart will never bring forth true grace. Naturall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, children, and the like, doe fall into the laps of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men though they doe not ſeeke them from God by this exerciſe of prayer; but ſpirituall bleſſings cannot be obtained by any other meanes, if this be not alſo joyned to the meanes to ſanctifie them. You have therefore cauſe enough to pray together as well as <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebekkah,</hi> even though you have not barren bodies, yea, and if you have children, yet it is requiſite to crave Gods favourable bleſſing upon them, without which, they may prove afterwards the greateſt croſſes you have, inſtead of the greateſt comforts; ſee therefore that you be not ſlack in this ſervice of God.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Rebekkahs</hi> duty is ſeen,<note place="margin">2. She inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God when the children ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in her wombe.</note> in that ſhe went to God to enquire when ſhe found a more then ordinary ſtriving in her wombe: wee muſt all learne of her to keep our peace with God, and to be alwaies ready to ſeeke to him, if any thing befall us that puts us to feare or trouble, as you ſee the people of God have done at all times. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the children of God ſtill to enquire of him, and ſeeke to him in all occurrents. Indeed it pleaſeth him to ſend ſuch occaſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that by them we may be drawne nearer unto him, and viſit him more often, and more cheerefully. They therefore that are ſtrangers to God, and run any whether, rather then to him for help and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when troubles doe come unto them, are much too blame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for profaneneſſe. They acknowledge God alone in word, but deny him in deed, that are thus eſtranged from him. Mend this fault now, and that you may with more aſſurance run to God when croſſes and cumbers befall you, be ſure to pray without ceaſing, and to keep your hearts in with him, by calling upon him at all times. It is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27208:151"/>
a moſt happy thing to have the Throne of grace alwaies open to ones prayers; and it is kept open by continuance, and daily exerciſing ones ſelfe in this ſervice. If any ſay, how ſhall we enquire of God now, ſeeing we are now deſtitute of extraordinary Prophets, by whoſe meanes we may ſeek unto him? I anſwer, we have his Word, wee have his Name, we have his Miniſters and faithfull people to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and by thoſe we may as ſufficiently ſeek unto him, as by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Prophets. Wherefore as <hi>Rebekkah</hi> feeling that buſling in her wombe, ſaid, why am I thus? And went to enquire of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.22. So muſt we in all occaſions of diſquietment, either of body, or of minde, thinke with our ſelves, why is it thus with me? and muſt come to prayer, and crave direction and help of him; We muſt run to his word, and ſeek to informe our ſelves from thence, what may be the cauſe of our preſent eſtate, and conſult with his faithfull ſervants that have a larger meaſure of knowledge then our ſelves, that by their advice we may learne what is fit for us to doe, and upon what ground it is that matters be ſo with us, and God by theſe means will ſettle and quiet our mindes as ſurely, and firmly, as of old he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to doe by meanes of his holy Prophets. So you have <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekkahs</hi> piety to God, now ſee her carriage to her husband, and we finde in the Story of her life, teſtimonies of her being a dutifull wife unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. She was dutifull to her husband.</note>For firſt, when ſhe found him inclined to go againſt the will of God (in giving away that ſolemne bleſſing which ſhe inherited from his Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> unto the Son to whom it was not due, becauſe God had preferred the younger before the elder) ſhe was carefull to prevent that ſin, and to procure the bleſſing unto <hi>Iacob,</hi> to whom it was due, and how? Not by brawling and falling out with him, but by a gentle and a quiet meanes. I commend not the uſing of guile and falſhood, but in that ſhe fell not to it by violence of ſpeech, but by a gentle and milde way, in that I cannot but commend her. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe did the part of a loving, diſcreete, and dutifull wife, who reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced her husband, and deſires to keep him from ſin. She came not chaffing to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as once <hi>Sarah</hi> did to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but by a gentle courſe ſhe cauſed him to eſcape the fault before he could commit it, and beyond his purpoſe. So muſt you good wives carry your ſelves, if your husbands be about to ſwerve out of the way, and you perceive it, you muſt endeavour by ſweet and dutifull courſes to prevent, or recall them from ſin, not to uſe fierce paſſion, brawling, as ſometimes women of a fierce ſpirit doe, who many times are puniſhed for their indiſcreet frowardneſſe, by failing of their deſires, and making things worſe, rather then changing them for the better. The ſame diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her husband ſhe ſhewed in another paſſage too, for that ſhe might procure the ſending of <hi>Iacob</hi> into Padan Aram, ſhe did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly declare the matter to her husband, but came and related the trouble ſhe had with <hi>Eſaus</hi> wives, and told how bitter a thing it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:27208:151"/>
would prove unto her, if ſhe were as bad yoked with another wife that <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhould bring, and ſo won him to diſpatch <hi>Iacob</hi> for a wife in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Padan Aram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A woman ſhould alwaies deale by loving meanes with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to get the good ſhe would at his hands, and not by violence and clamour. You that would have the repute of good wives in your own hearts, ſee that you follow <hi>Rebekkah,</hi> prevaile by diſcreet, wiſe, and curteous courſes, not by ſtrong hand, and violence. But theſe eager, ſharp, and paſſionate women, that will wreſt the things the deſire out of their husbands hands, (perhaps alſo inconvenient things) by chiding, and big, and loud words, as once I told you <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> ſought to do, or elſe by puling, and whining, and charging their husbands not to love them elſe, as the wife of <hi>Sampſon</hi> did, are to be blamed as undiſcreet, and diſobedient wives, and if they repent not of their folly, and unrulineſſe, the Lord will one day call them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their miſdemeanours; Gentleneſſe, and dutifulneſſe muſt adorn your converſation, and your husbands muſt ſee your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion coupled with feare to diſpleaſe, ſo ſhall you make your ſelve and husbands happy, both at once, and have a kinde of lawfull power with them over whom you have not any authority.</p>
            <p>But now of <hi>Rebekkahs</hi> carriage to her Sons, ſhe was in the right,<note place="margin">4. She loved her beſt ſon moſt.</note> ſhe loved the good ſon whom God loved moſt; <hi>Iacob</hi> was a plain man, but a good man, beloved of God, therefore ſhe did love him too, and herein ſhe did much excell her husband <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and was more to be commended, and did better pleaſe God. Indeed herein ſhe ſhewed her obedience to God, as well as her affection to <hi>Iacob,</hi> whom ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have attain the bleſſing, becauſe ſhe knew that God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it unto him. It is a neceſſary thing, that men ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves unto God in every thing, and become furtherers the beſt they can of fulfilling his good pleaſure, when once he hath vouchſafed to manifeſt it unto them. O let us learn to ſubmit our wills thus to Gods will, and to make it our care to have thoſe things done by our ſelves and others which he would have done. And learne Parents, and all men, of <hi>Rebekkah,</hi> to love them beſt in whom the Lord hath printed his Image moſt clearely and abundantly. Let godlineſſe be the loadſtone of our affections rather then any other thing, yea let us all learn of her too, to ſtrive to procure a bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our children, though not by ſuch a courſe as ſhe took, for herein ſhe was manifeſtly blame worthy, yet by all good and honeſt courſes that we can, even by our prayers for them, and good inſtructions to them; and the like. You have heard <hi>Rebekkahs</hi> goodneſſe, ſo much as I remember that the Scriptures have left upon record, ſaving it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of her, that ſhe made ſavoury meate for her husband,<note place="margin">5. She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſuch food for her husband as he liked.</note> ſuch as he loved, ſhe could not have done it ſo well then, if ſhe had not taken notice of it, and done it often before. So it is the part of a good woman to cheriſh her husband in his diet, ſo far as her meanes and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:27208:152"/>
ability will permit, and having informed himſelf what is pleaſing to him, accordingly to provide it for him. So ſhall ſhe ſhew good will to her husband, which alwaies makes one carefull to pleaſe and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the party beloved. Here is a patterne for you to live after, all you good women ſeek to give your husbands due content in their food, prepare things acceptable to them as you be able, eſpecially, if they be weak, blinde, or otherwiſe afflicted; that your kinde u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage this way, may even countervaile the want of other benefits, and cauſe their lives to be as comfortable to them, as in ſuch croſſes they may be: but without doubt ſhe is a bad and unloving wife, who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth to give her husband ſatisfaction in this point, who ſets him ſhort, and cares not to fit him with pleaſing food; if they be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of meanes, yea, who feeds her ſelf deliciouſly in his abſence, and muſt have ſome choice proviſion for her ſelf when ſhe pleaſeth, that ſhall be hidden from his eye, and withdrawne from his mouth.</p>
            <p>A great fault it is in a wife, to forget that her husband and ſhe do make but one body, and to divide him from her in eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to whom ſhe is ſo nearly linked in other ſociety. Be no more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders in this kinde, if you have been ſuch, but now be good nurſes to your husbands, and let them at leaſt partake with your ſelves of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good fare which you provide for your ſelves. Theſe be the things commendable in <hi>Rebekkah.</hi> Now I come to her faults.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Her faults, She uſed fraud to conveigh the bleſſing to <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               </note>Firſt, ſhe uſed deceit and fraud to conveigh the bleſſing unto <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and ſought rather to hooke it to him by a fleſhly device, then to compaſſe it by a convenient and lawfull way. You ſhall reade the Story <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.1. and 17. She knew her husband was blinde, therefore ſhe ſpake to <hi>Iacob</hi> to get the bleſſing by a cunning device, ſhe ſends for a Kid, makes ſuch a diſh as was pleaſing to <hi>Iſaacs</hi> palate, uſes meanes to make his hands and neck ſeem rough, like unto <hi>Eſaus,</hi> by covering them with the skins of the Kids as handſomely as ſhee could, and ſo ſends him in to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> having before emboldned him to ſay, though falſely, that he was <hi>Eſau</hi> the eldeſt Son. This was a ſin in her, the matter of it was fraud and faſhood, the aggravations of it were, firſt, ſhe drew <hi>Iacob</hi> into the ſin of lying and ſhifting, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own temper, for the Scripture witneſſeth of him, that <hi>He was a plain man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, ſhe was ſet upon it, that though <hi>Iacob</hi> objected he ſhould get a curſe rather then a bleſſing, by ſeeming to his Father a deceiver and a mocker, yet ſhe found a meanes to encourage him in his lying, by a trick to beguile his Father well enough; that he ſhould never finde him out, and ſo drew him to go thorough with the crafty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: this was practiſed even againſt her husband alſo, to whom it leaſt of all becommeth a wife to uſe deceit and lying. Only there was one mitigation and extenuation of her fault, ſhe did aime at a good end, but a good intention cannot juſtifie unlawfull means that are uſed to accompliſh it. We have in her then a fault of craftineſſe,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27208:152"/>
and deceit, and lying. There is a great difference betwixt wiſdome and fraud, wiſdome will alwaies hold it ſelfe to the ſide of juſtice, not alone in the thing it mainly ſeekes, but alſo in the path which it chooſeth to walk in to that end; But fraud is as it were a rotten wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and cares not to follow equity and truth in the way it takes, and neither many times in the end. Abhorre fraud, that is, the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a thing wilily with lying, and falſhood, whether it be good or bad, but moſt of all if it be bad. <hi>It is a ſin to do evill that good may come of it,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>It is a ſin to lie, even for Gods cauſe, and to defend even his juſtice with falſe tales,</hi> and figments. As <hi>Iob</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth his frinds that did ſo, and that they might not ſeeme to impute unrighteouſneſſe to God in ſo ſore puniſhing of <hi>Iob,</hi> they did impute hypocriſie to him that was puniſhed. It is a ſin to lie even for a purpoſe otherwiſe good, for we are commanded to <hi>put away lying.</hi> Wherefore, conſider of your ſelves, if you have not lyed and begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, if you have not allured and encouraged others to joyne with you in lying, and beguiling, that elſe would not have done it. If you have done it againſt thoſe that were neare to you, to whom you ſhould have uſed more reſpect: And worſt of all, if you have done it for a ſinfull end too, that is, not to get what was due to you, as here <hi>Iacob,</hi> but what was not due, by over-reaching your neighbours in bargaining, and the like, not to keep a man from ſin as here, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to draw him to ſin, as in caſe of unjuſt complaints to a ſuperiour, to make him puniſh, when he ſhould not puniſh; Not to do your ſelves good, as here <hi>Iacob,</hi> but to do another a miſchief, as <hi>Davids</hi> falſe accuſers to <hi>Saul,</hi> and if your conſciences accuſe you of ſuch fraud, repent of it before God, blame your ſelves for it, ſeek pardon, reſolve to put it away for hereafter, and intreate the Lord to fortifie you againſt all ſuch wickedneſſe, that ſo you may be pardoned, elſe great is the danger of ſuch wickedneſſe, <hi>The bread of deceit ſhall be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell in the belly, and wealth gotten by lying ſhall prove but vanity toſſed to and fro of them that ſeeke death.</hi> I pray you, conſider how God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed this guile in theſe two good perſons, and that though they had a good end in it; For, this occaſioned the rage of <hi>Eſau,</hi> which made him threaten, yea, and after attempt to kill <hi>Iacob,</hi> and ſo drove <hi>Iacob</hi> from <hi>Iſaacs</hi> family, and kept them from that comfortable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment each of other, which elſe they might have had for twenty years together. And be you now lovers of plainneſſe, abhorre ſhifting and falſhood, truſt God with the ſucceſſe of all your affaires, and truſt not to your own hearts, and heads, he that ſeekes to effect his deſires by honeſt and juſt meanes, he puts confidence in God, and not in himſelfe, he that uſeth lying and couſinage, he puts not his hope in God, but in his own wit and heart: Shew true and well grounded confidence in God, by keeping your ſelves within the paths of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and truth, lovely pathes, faire pathes, ſtraight pathes, which ſhall ſurely lead you to more happineſſe and comfort at laſt, than lying,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:27208:153"/>
and fraud, hatefull, dirty, and crooked paths can poſſibly do. Learn as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>To hate lying, and to love Gods Law,</hi> love to be guided by God, who is the God of truth, and hate to follow lies, which are of the devill, the author of lying. Doe not object, that you cannot poſſibly eſcape ſuch and ſuch miſchiefe, bring about ſuch and ſuch a good buſineſſe, unleſſe you turne a little aſide; to a little lying. I anſwer firſt, truſt God with ſucceſſe, beleeve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove hope, let faith guide you, not naturall reaſon; Cannot he doe that which reaſon will call impoſſible? Hath not be ſaid, <hi>Rowle thy ſelf upon God, and thy waies, and he ſhall bring it to paſſe?</hi> Will you not reſt upon him for the performance of ſo evident a promiſe? And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I anſwer, that the greateſt evill muſt be ſuffered rather than the ſmalleſt ſin committed, and the attaining of the greateſt benefit, cannot countervaile the committing of the leaſt ſin, and that man doth not truly know either God, or ſin, or the world, or himſelfe, that doth not yeeld to theſe truths.</p>

               <note place="margin">2. She was too much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at her evill daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in law.</note>So you have this fault of <hi>Rebekkahs,</hi> another is, that ſhe was too much troubled at her evill daughters in law, and was weary of life becauſe of them. This is a fault, to make croſſes too too heavy our ſelves, to be ſo diſtempered with them, ſo, as to become weary of life becauſe of them, yea, it is a fault found in thoſe that were truly religious, and godly; <hi>Eliah</hi> would fain have parted with his ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the troubles which he met withall, he deſired <hi>to die,</hi> ſaith the Story,<note place="margin">2 King. 19.4.</note> and ſaid, <hi>It is enough, Now Lord take away my ſoule from me, for I am no better than my Fathers. Moſes</hi> would fain have dyed too, when the people murmured againſt him, and he poures forth his griefe before God in theſe words, <hi>If thou wilt deale thus with me, kill me now, kil me if I have found favour in thine eyes, and let me not ſee mine evill.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you finde good men deſirous to eſcape death, and crying, Lord ſave me from the hands of mine enemies, and ſometimes againe even covetous of it, and crying with vehemency again and again, kill me Lord, kill me, and if thou loveſt me, kill me. <hi>Iob</hi> was exceeding deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to die,<note place="margin">To deſire death becauſe of miſery, is a ſin, and why?</note> and ſaid, <hi>He would ſeek for it as for gold, yea, and fine gold,</hi> So you perceive that mans nature is prone to waxe weary of living, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of affliction, and that this is a fault, and a weakneſſe, is evident. It is an act of ingratitude, becauſe a man conſiders not as well the good he enjoyeth, as the evill, for if he would reckon well, he doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies receive more good at Gods hand in this life, than evill, but as one bitter morſell cauſeth that the mouth taſteth nothing almoſt but bitterneſſe, though it have before received many dainty morſels, ſo it is with us in this caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, it is a fruit of hopeleſneſſe, and deſpaire, the ſoule doth not expect the favourable goodneſſe of God to ſtrengthen, and deliver in due time, but thinks it will never be better with mee till I die, and therefore wiſheth it ſelfe out of the world. Hope would hold the heart up from theſe faintings, but it is a kinde of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:27208:153"/>
deſpaire that caſts it into ſuch ſwounes, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid, <hi>As for mine hope, where is it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, pride is one great cauſe of this diſpoſition, men conſider not with themſelves how unworthy they be of any good, how much they have deſerved far greater evill, and therefore are immoderately vexed with thoſe they feele, and therefore count their beeing a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. But is it not a fruit of great pride in a man, that as if he were his own maker, preſerver, diſpoſer, will be no longer then he may have his own will? and may ſee things to go along with him after his owne wiſhes.</p>
            <p>Further, a man wrongs himſelfe exceedingly, by ſuffering himſelf to grow weary of life, for firſt, he makes the miſery greater, by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe weaker to beare it. If a man be to beare a great burden, it doth him much hurt to ſcratch the skin of his ſhoulder, for that will adde much to the pain of bearing. A gauled place will ſmart of it ſelfe, how ill doth be provide for himſelfe, that rubs off the skin from his ſhoulders, when he is put to carry a thing. So doth he that will needs give way to ſo much impatiency, as to be weary of life, yea, he expoſeth himſelfe to the danger of becomming a ſelf-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, that yeeldeth to this wearineſſe of life. For it will not be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to perſwade any man to caſt away that which is his burden. So it is evident, that this was an offence in <hi>Rebekkah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now come you men and women of all rankes, looke into your ſelves. Have not you alſo been weary of life, and that upon a very ſmall occaſion? A maide is croſſed in her deſires, by her parents for her good, and ſhe ſees no likelihood of having what ſhee would have, then ſhe pules and takes on, and wiſheth ſhe were dead and buried, ſhe would forgive him that would knock her on the head. A man hath met with ſomewhat a froward woman which vexeth him with her words, then he will be dead in a chafe, I would I were out of the world, never man was ſo peſtered with a ſhrew as I, ſo it is with wives too. Come now, recount you owne paſſions, are you not aſhamed of theſe drunken diſtempers? what is life, a thing ſo dog cheape with you, that upon every occaſion you would caſt it away? Are your ſelves things of ſo little value that ſo ſmall a matter ſhould make you weary of your ſelves? You wrong God exceedingly in ſuch diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, for you make it appeare that you think of him, as of an angry governour, that cares not how unreaſonably he laies upon his ſervants in his anger: Either theſe corrections are ſufferable, or not, (I meane ſuch as by wiſdome and diſcretion you might compoſe your ſelves to beare with gentleneſſe,) or they be not, if they be, why do you chafe thus? If they be not, who hath ſent them? Verily you provoke God to ſend unſufferable croſſes, that will make eaſie croſſes unſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; What ſaith the Father to the froward childe, doe you cry for nothing, take you that then to make you cry for ſomething, and ſo doubles and redoubles his blows with a ſtrong arme, till the childe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:27208:154"/>
feeling the ſmart of his Fathers anger, begins to compoſe himſelfe to a little more ſufferance. Brethren, let us repent of this folly, there ſcarce liveth a man that hath not overſhot himſelfe in this faſhion: O let us repent of it, and let us diligently reſiſt ſuch diſorderly paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hereafter; Let nothing make us weary of life but ſin, and not that ſo exceſſively, as to make us intemperately wiſh death. Of ſin we ſhould be weary, but of life for ſins ſake I know not whether we may allow our ſelves at all to be weary. But for croſſes, be they what they will, we ſhould not be ſo weak and impatient, as to grow weary of life. For God is able to deliver us out of all croſſes, and will do it, and he will ſo ſanctifie them to us, that it may be more for our profit than if it were removed, and can give, as in <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe he did, ſo bleſſed an iſſue, that our ſelves ſhall confeſſe it was but our folly, not to be willing to continue under them according to his will. Had not <hi>Iob</hi> cauſe to unwiſh his former wiſhes, when the Lord did make ſo large an addition of happy dayes unto him? Above all, we muſt conſider of our worthineſſe to be damned, that we may not thinke much of croſſes, and labour ſo to reſt upon God for the eſcape of damnation, that afflictions which are but for a ſhort ſeaſon, may not ſeeme unto us extreame. Looke upon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, what ſufferings were comparable to his? Yet we never meet with any wearineſſe of life, or wiſhing of death in him. Looke upon S. <hi>Paul</hi> too, Never man had feeling of greater tribulation, and he tels us, that hee tooke pleaſure in neceſſities, afflictions, tribulations; but that he wiſhed himſelfe dead, that hee might be free from his croſſes, wee never reade.</p>
            <p>Let us follow the vertues of godly men, but let their weakneſſes be our warnings. And that we may not diſtaſte life for any croſſes that befall us therein, let us often renew our faith in Gods gracious promiſes, to give us an happy iſſue out of all, and to bring us ſafely to his heavenly kingdome. Moreover, if ſometimes theſe fainting fits doe gather upon us, and our mindes be overtaken with this tired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, let us learne though to be humbled, yet not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. We conclude not againſt <hi>Elias, Moſes, Rebekkah, Iob,</hi> that they were not truly ſanctified, becauſe they were imperfect in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; Why ſhould we make ſuch untrue, and uncharitable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet concluſions, either againſt our ſelves, or others with whom we live? As an extenuating of faults to make them ſeeme nothing, and make our hearts hard under them, is to be condemned, ſo an over-aggravating of them to make our ſelves ſeem no children, making our caſe worſe then ever any mans before, is likewiſe to be condemned; Satan is author of both theſe follies, and the effect of the latter is to drive us from God, as well as of the former, and all things are ill uſed when they tend to keepe us from comming to God, and truſting in him. So much of <hi>Rebekkahs</hi> good and bad, now of the good and evill occurrents that befell her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:27208:154"/>Her proſperity firſt was great,<note place="margin">3. Her proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, She was effectually called.</note> for God called her from her Fathers houſe, in which Idolatry did raigne, and falſe worſhip prevailed, to be a member of <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, and a mother of the Meſſiah, and a profeſſor, and practiſer of Gods true religion; and not alone ſo, but gave her grace to be a godly woman, an heire of the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> together with her husband. This is the greateſt of mercies here below, to be called from darkneſſe to light, from ſerving the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and Idols, to ſerve the true and living God.</p>
            <p>If God have granted to any this mercy, even to call them effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to himſelfe out of the darkneſſe of a falſe worſhip and religion, to the light of a godly life. How much cauſe hath he to bleſſe God, and to rejoyce in this mercy above all mercies, and bee freequently and heartily thankfull? But if you have not yet attained it, for many live in the Church that be not of it; take notice of your wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and now cry earneſtly to God to bring you to the effectuall and ſaving knowledge of his truth, that you alſo may be indeed, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But <hi>Rebekkah</hi> had other benefits, beauty, health, and ſtrength,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.16.20 2. She was beautifull, healthy, ſtrong, had a rich and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly husband, and a good childe.</note> for ought we reade, after marriage as before. A rich and godly husband in whom ſhe was doubly happy for her ſoule and ſtate, and one godly childe too, whom ſhe dearely loved, and who ſhewed himſelfe a man worthy to be loved. A good husband, a good ſtate, a good childe, good health, bee they not benefits indebting us to God in many praiſes, and thankes, and much carefull obedience? Let not theſe mercies be ſtrangers to your thoughts, but ponder upon them to ſtir up your ſelves to thankſgiving and obedience.</p>
            <p>Now for her croſſes,<note place="margin">4. Her afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> ſome ſhee ſuffered in her dayes as well as others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, her husband fell blinde and weake, and almoſt bedridden.<note place="margin">1.

                  </p>
               </note> Likewiſe ſhe could not but grieve to ſee her husbands affections to be ſo much more than they ſhould have been for a long time upon her elder, but worſer ſon.</p>
            <p>It was alſo a great griefe unto her to ſee the rudeneſſe and bloodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her ſon <hi>Eſau,</hi> who comforted himſelfe againſt his brother, with an intention, ſo ſoon as his Fathers funerals were over, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him, and rob him of the bleſſing, though he could not get it to himſelfe. Would it not cut the heart of one of you Parents, to heare that one of your ſons (you having but a couple in all the world) ſhould reſolve to become a murderer of the other, and ſo you ſtood in danger of being deprived of them both at once; would not both theſe things grieve you? Againe,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Iacob</hi> was baniſhed from her as it were.</note> it was a griefe to her to have her good ſon as it were baniſhed from her houſe, and compelled to fly away in ſecret for his life. For had he not been compelled to ſteale
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:27208:155"/>
into <hi>Padan Aram</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Eſau,</hi> as to ſteale thence again in reſpect of <hi>Laban,</hi> his Fathers eſtate was not ſo low, that he muſt needs have travailed over that Iordan with a ſtaffe, and come to <hi>Labans</hi> houſe all alone, and there have ſerved an hard ſervice for a wife. Sure <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not a prodigall, he had not conſumed his eſtate ſo, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> grandchilde muſt be ſent out ſo poorely appointed, whoſe ſteward when he fetched a wife for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> had ten Camels well laden with rich things, and many ſervants to attend him, and ſo with ſpeed returned home with his errand. But feare of <hi>Eſau</hi> cauſed him to goe ſpeedily and ſecretly, that no man might know it, leſt ſo he might have fallen into miſchiefe by his meanes, and to tarry ſo long till he might heare his brother was pacified.</p>
            <p>Now did not this, think you, wound <hi>Rebekkahs</hi> heart? Did ſhe not part with a great part of her comfort, when ſhe parted with her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſon <hi>Iacob?</hi> ſo far, ſo long, and in ſuch a manner.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. She was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed with the frowardneſſe of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note>But worſt of all, ſo long as ſhe lived with her daughters, ſhee was miſerably vexed with their frowardneſſe, and ill conditions. Indeed at length <hi>Eſau</hi> tooke his journey to mount Seir, where her friends dwelled, and made this croſſe more eaſie, by removing his habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his wives and all he had: but in the mean it was an anguiſh to her, and that (<hi>viz.</hi> loſſe of <hi>Eſau</hi> too, when <hi>Iacob</hi> was gone) could not but miniſter matter of ſome affliction to her in minde.</p>
            <p>Now let all of us be perſwaded to looke for theſe and the like croſſes, that by fortifying our ſelves againſt them, we may be made more patient, and ſo beare them with leſſe diſcontent: for what are we, that God ſhould handle us with more indulgence than this ſo good a woman? And thoſe that lie under any ſuch croſſe in huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſons, daughters, daughters in law, let them frame themſelves to a more contented ſuffering, becauſe they finde that they bee no other kind of evils, than thoſe wherewith their Father hath exerciſed their betters in former times, as he doth alſo for the preſent; Hee muſt be an unruly childe that will roare, and take on, when he beareth no more than his other brethren and ſiſters beare before him; yea, and if we have eſcaped theſe particular croſſes, let us be thankfull to God for our freedome even from them, and make the bearing of the reſt more eaſie, becauſe we have not (as we have deſerved, and might have had) the ſame we have, and theſe alſo for an overplus of miſery.</p>

            <p>Firſt, for his birth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſau</hi> his birth.</note> we are informed that hee was the ſon of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Rebekkah</hi> the wife of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> daughter of <hi>Bethuel,</hi> by his wife <hi>Milcah.</hi> Which <hi>Bethuel</hi> was ſon of <hi>Nachor,</hi> the brother of <hi>Abraham.</hi> He was borne in the yeare of the world 2108, as ſome thinke; and as others, in the yeare 2168. and after the flood, as ſome thinke 512. and as others, 562. for there is 60. yeares difference in chronologie, becauſe of the doubt about <hi>Abrahams</hi> birth. Now the manner of his birth was this, as the Scriptures relate, Gen. 25.25. <hi>He came out firſt in colour red, and all over rough, as an hairy garment,</hi> for which cauſe his name was called <hi>Eſau,</hi> which ſigne made as one that was ſtronger than ordinary children be, and all over covered with haire. In him the Lord ſhewed the freedome of his election, as the Apoſtle notes, Rom. 9. For, <hi>Before the children were borne,</hi> or, <hi>had done good or evill,</hi> it was ſaid, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> God choſe not him but <hi>Iacob,</hi> though they were borne both of the ſame Parents, and at the ſame burden.</p>
            <p>Now concerning his life, we muſt conſider; 1. That which was

good therein. 2. That which was evill. 3. His proſperity. 4. His croſſes and miſeries.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. He ſhewed good reſpect unto <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Father.</p>
               </note>For the firſt, ſome things he did that for matter were good and commendable, as even a bad man may have ſome good things found in him. The firſt good thing was, that he did ſhew good reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Father. For he was glad to gratifie him in his diet, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home the Veniſon that he caught, of which was made dainty meat, which the old man loved to feed upon, and when he came to him to preſent his Veniſon, according to his Fathers appointment, that he might receive the bleſſing from his Father, he ſpake reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto him. For when he brought the meate ready prepared for his eating, he ſaid thus to him, <hi>Let my Father ariſe and eat of his ſons Veni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon, that thy ſoule may bleſſe mee.</hi> Chap. 27.31. and after ver. 34. <hi>Bleſſe me, even me alſo, ô my Father,</hi> and ver. 38. <hi>Haſt thou but one bleſsing my Father, bleſſe me, even me alſo, ô my Father.</hi> Though his Father had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the bleſſing to <hi>Iacob</hi> his brother, yet he doth not rage and grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to paſſionate expoſtulations, but with gentle and reverent termes, and with teares, and with prayers ſeekes to get ſome bleſſing from him. This proveth evidently, that he carried a reverent eſteeme of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his heart, and honoured him duly. The ſame love and reſpect he ſhewed to <hi>Iſaac</hi> after, for when his wrath was kindled againſt his brother <hi>Iacob,</hi> and that he minded to revenge himſelfe by killing <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob:</hi> Yet he reſolved to forbeare till <hi>Iſaac</hi> was dead, that he might not procure too much griefe and ſorrow to him in his old age, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is recorded, that he ſaid, <hi>The dayes of mourning for my Father are at hand, then will I kill my brother Iacob,</hi> ver. 41. He would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the murder of his brother for <hi>Iſaacs</hi> ſake till after his death, but that he bare ſome reſpect and good will unto his Father. And hee ſhewed the ſame reſpect unto him after, Chap. 28.6. For when hee perceived his Father had bleſſed <hi>Iacob,</hi> and ſent him to fetch a wife from <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> and not to take any Canaanitiſh woman, and that the daughters of Canaan which he had married diſpleaſed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he went to his Vncle <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and tooke his daughter <hi>Mahalath</hi> to wife, ſeeking as well as his wit could ſerve, to pleaſe his Father in that latter match, although indeed he went not rightly to work in that marriage neither. Some care you ſee he ſhewed to give his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther content, though he had not wiſdome enough to order himſelfe rightly for that end.</p>
            <p>Thus this <hi>Eſau,</hi> though he wanted grace, and feared not God, yet he bare love and reverence in ſome degree as a carnall man could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Father <hi>Iſaac;</hi> who loved him dearely, and ſo he requited his love againe, with ſuch a kinde of love as might be found in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified perſon. Now all you ſons and daughters that have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents living with you, or have had, come and lay your ſelves in the ballance with <hi>Eſau,</hi> and conſider if you have ſo much as equalled him in this kinde of imperfect dutifulneſſe towards your Parents.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:27208:156"/>
He out of a kinde of naturall inclination, or out of hope of being ſtill kindly uſed and bleſſed of his Father, ſhewed much reſpect unto him divers wayes. Hath nature, have carnall ends prevailed ſo much with you to encline your hearts to your parents, as they prevailed with <hi>Eſau?</hi> If ſo, yet boaſt not of this, thinke not much the better of your ſelves, theſe kinde of ſhadows of vertues, cannot prove you to be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly children, nor afford you ſound comfort, becauſe themſelves be not ſound and perfect. You have no great reaſon to pleaſe your ſelves, becauſe you are as good as <hi>Eſau,</hi> an unſanctified man, and one of whom we can give little hope, but that he was a caſta-way. I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſatisfie not your ſelves, be not good in your own eyes becauſe of this painted and counterfeit goodneſſe. But if otherwiſe it be, and that it is evident you come far ſhort of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and have not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much regard of your parents as he hath done, then how bad muſt you account your ſelves, that are much more ſinfull even than an <hi>Eſau</hi> might have been? And it is cleare, that divers children be far worſe than this bad ſon of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> for they ſhew no reverence, no ſubmiſſion to their aged Parents, but apparently ſleight them in word and deed; grumble at them, chafe againſt them, carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cuttedly, and curriſhly towards them, if at any time they be croſſed by them; will not be held from following their own evill deſires, as <hi>Eſau</hi> was from killing his Brother, by a deſire not to grieve them, but wilfully run on in their wicked courſes, even though they ſee and know that their wicked carriage doth greatly afflict and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their Parents; but purpoſely ſome do things to torment them. O, ſin hath a greater ſway and dominion in ſuch childrens hearts than it had in <hi>Eſaus,</hi> and they are far more wicked than he was. Yea, when they ſee their Parents diſpleaſed with their wayes, yet they have not ſo much deſire to give them content as <hi>Eſau</hi> had, nor do not ſo much as labour in any manner, though never ſo poorely, to give them any ſatisfaction at all. Woe, woe unto ſuch children; what can he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from God, that is a viler ſon than <hi>Eſau</hi> was? Let ſuch ſhame themſelves by his example, and now receive reproofe with meekneſs, and greatly repent of their undutifulneſſe, if ever they purpoſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pardon. And now, let all children that deſire to enjoy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the comfort of being the children and choſen of God, ſtrive to outſtrip <hi>Eſau</hi> in filiall obedience and duty. Let them for conſcience ſake to God, put on a largor meaſure of love, and a greater reverence to their Parents, labouring to pleaſe them in all things, in the Lord, &amp; out of conſcience, to ſubmit themſelves unto them, &amp; honor them becauſe God hath required it at their hands, and to labour to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare all ſin, as in an holy regard to God, ſo in part alſo, out of a feare to vex and kill their godly Parents, whoſe tender affection to them cannot but cauſe that their wicked carriage ſhall prove a mighty cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſive unto their ſoules. Be as good as <hi>Eſau,</hi> yea in this matter be you far better than he, content not thy ſelfe to be even with a miſerable
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:27208:157"/>
               <hi>Eſau</hi> in dutifulneſſe to your Parents. Another thing in <hi>Eſau</hi> we have recorded in Scripture, which is commendable, and that towards his brother <hi>Iacob,</hi> for though he went againſt him with foure hundred men, intending to take a ſharp revenge by killing him at leaſt, if not his wives and children too,<note place="margin">2. He was mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his brothers lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, kinde, humble carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> yet when he ſaw his brothers loving, and kinde, and humble carriage, in ſending him a rich preſent, and in bowing down and ſaluting him with his face to the ground ſeaven times; his naturall affection prevailed againſt his former unruly paſſion, and he handled him very curteouſly, and ran to him, wept on his neck, kiſſed him, gave him kinde words, invited him to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and would have left off his ſervants with him to do him ſervice, and ſo returned, and did him no hurt at all.</p>
            <p>Every man ſees that this was well done of <hi>Eſau.</hi> Come and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him, and if you have been tranſported with rage againſt any, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially againſt a brother for any true or imaginary iniquity; yet when ſubmiſſiveneſſe and curteſie is ſhewed unto you, let it melt you, let it win you, pacifie, appeaſe you, and cauſe your paſſion to depart, and though you have intended, attempted, and begun to uſe violence, yet caſt out ſuch thoughts, forbeare the execution of ſuch evill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and turn your violence into kindneſſe and humanity. Be better than <hi>Eſau,</hi> and do this to any man, as he to a brother, and without ſuch gifts and ſubmiſſion, which be did by ſuch inducements, and ſhew love and kindneſſe for very conſcience, as he did out of naturall paſſion ſtriving in him: Yea, if any man have been imbittered againſt another for any cauſe, and hath ſo far yeelded to his own fury, as to begin to do naughtily in ſeeking revenge; O let him do as well as <hi>Eſau</hi> did, go back in the middeſt of his enterpriſe, and not ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ſo confirmed in wickedneſſe, as to go through with ſinfull deſignes. Let the feare of God, the checks of conſcience, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Gods diſpleaſure againſt the doers of ſuch things, even reclaime you in the middeſt, as naturall kindneſſe did this ſinfull man. Be not ſatisfied to do as well as <hi>Eſau</hi> in this caſe, but exceed him, and doe far better than he, that you may ſhew your ſelves to have that grace of which <hi>Eſau</hi> was deſtitute.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. He was not greedy of gifts</note>Farther <hi>Eſau,</hi> for matter of goods, ſhewes himſelfe not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly greedy and worldly minded, for when his brother bad ſent unto him a great drove of cattle, even a gift of great value. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 14, 15. Two hundred ſhee Goates, and as many Ewes, with twenty hee Goates, and as many Rams, with thirty milch Camels and their Colts, and forty Kine, and ten Buls, and twenty ſhee Aſſes with ten Foales.

already rich and abundant, ſeek not to get into your hands though it be by receiving a gift, that which is anothers. O that <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould be able to ſay, I have enough, keep that which is thine, and many that be Chriſtians in ſhew, ſhould not be able to diſcerne when they have enough, but ſhould be as eager to get even by worſe meanes, or as bad as this, even by taking gifts and bribes for doing but even juſtice or which is worſe, for doing injuſtice, and ſhould by oppreſſion and harſh dealing even with poore and needy men, their Tenants and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings, ſeek to get even more than enough.</p>
            <p>If any man amongſt you finde himſelfe ſo earthly diſpoſed, let him earneſtly condemne himſelfe, and ſay alas, what a ſlave am I to riches? that have not yet ſo far denyed the world, but that I am more covetous and unjuſt than <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhewed himſelfe.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, yea, <hi>Eſau</hi> did this towards a brother;</p>
            <p>I anſwer, doth not Chriſtianity teach us to love our neighbours as our ſelves?</p>
            <p>If any ſay, but though <hi>Eſau</hi> ſaid he had enough, yet it may be, that he thought not ſo;</p>
            <p>I anſwer, In ſaying ſo, he ſhews he thought he was ſo at that time, and knew he ſhould be ſo, therefore ſhould a good man that would be counted far better than <hi>Eſau</hi> ſet himſelfe to be ſo indeed, and at all times?</p>
            <p>Come then, you that have eſtates large enough to afford you all due content, come I ſay, and learne of <hi>Eſau</hi> to know when you have enough, and not ſtrive to get more by any greedy, unjuſt and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive courſe.</p>
            <p>Let others enjoy their owne, and be you content with your owne, yea goe yet farther, and be content to loſe ſome of you owne to thoſe that are poore, and in neceſſity, and far lower and meaner than your ſelves.</p>
            <p>But laſt of all,<note place="margin">4. He joyned with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Father</note> 
               <hi>Eſau</hi> joyned with his brother <hi>Iacob</hi> in burying his Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and ſo at once ſhewed his reſpect to his Father, in doing that laſt duty, and his perfect reconciliation to his brother, in joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him to doe it. Learne you to ſhew honour to your Parents in the laſt act, and let not an old grudge ſtick ſo in your ſtomacks, as to hinder you from doing any good work becauſe you cannot bring your hearts to be partners with thoſe that have offended you. <hi>Eſau, Eſau</hi> ſhall riſe in judgement againſt you, if you continue ſtill to have ſuch a coare againſt them from whom you have received injury, as that their preſence will keep you from doing good workes with them in their company, and in their ſociety.</p>
            <p>And theſe be all the good things which I can call to minde that the Scripture tels of this evill man. Let us therefore paſſe on to the conſideration of his faults, which are more, and greater.</p>
            <p>And firſt in generall,<note place="margin">His faults, 1. In generall, he was an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</note> though he lived more than forty yeares in his Fathers houſe a religious man, and a carefull worſhipper of God,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:27208:158"/>
yet he lived there as an hypocrite, and got no true goodneſſe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by that he was not kept from fratricide, or brother-murdering, by any conſcience to God, but alone by a kinde of love and reſpect to his Father. Look to your ſelves I pray you, you that be children of godly Parents, and have been trained up by them as well as they knew how, look to your ſelves, that you continue not ſinfull, and wicked, and hypocrites at the laſt, ſuch I meane, as care not to get the true knowledge of God, but continue ſtill lovers and ſervants of ſin, though you have a little forme of godlineſſe, to forbeare ſome ſins, and doe ſome good things for your Parents ſake. This is to be an <hi>Eſau,</hi> even to enjoy the meanes of grace and ſalvation in a godly houſe, and there to conforme a little outwardly, and to abſtaine from ſome ſins out of reſpect to the Governours, though you have no true conſcience to God. Search your hearts you wives, children, ſervants, that are educated, and live under the roofe of good men in the Church of God, under good meanes, and ſee your miſery, if you be no better than this man was. And now labour to profit by the means of grace, to get the truth of grace cauſing you to ſtand in awe of God, and to depart from all wickedneſſe, out of due obedience to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that it may be ſaid of you, theſe and theſe, and all ſins you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to leave, not for ſiniſter reſpects of this or that perſon, or thing, of a Father, or the like, but out of love to God, and a true deſire to honour him that hath taken you to be his people. Thinke not well of your ſelves becauſe ſome ſelf reſpect, or humane conſideration keeps you from running into groſſer ſins, but drive to imprint ſuch a filiall regard to the living God in your hearts, that may cauſe you to ſhun all wickedneſſe for the Lords ſake, and then you may comfortably ſay in your ſelves, now I know I am a true member of the Church, and not as <hi>Eſau</hi> was, at leaſt then, a rotten, and a withering, and a fruitleſſe branch, that bringeth forth leaves alone and no good fruit.</p>
            <p>But let us more particularly ſearch into <hi>Eſau:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, in reſpect of his carriage of himſelfe in reſpect of outward things: then of his carriage for matters of religion, and the things of God. Thirdly, His behaviour to his Parents. Laſtly, to his brother.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. His parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular faults. 1. He gave himſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hunting.</note>For the firſt, his life was very faulty in the manner of his orders for the world, for in his younger time he gave himſelfe wholly to hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it is ſaid of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.27. <hi>The boyes grew up, and Eſau was a cunning Hunter, a man of the field;</hi> He meaneth a gallant fellow that gave himſelfe to little elſe but the ſport of hunting, and was ſtill, in the field following that ſport. He was a rich mans ſon, and his Father had great meanes, and allowed him enough, wherefore he cared not for any uſefull kinde of living, but followed ſports and jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and by name was a great hunter ſtill in the fields, to pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in that humour. Is not this alſo the common ſin of many richer perſons? who as they had wealth given them to be fewell to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and voluptuouſneſſe, give themſelves over to ſports, and ſome
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:27208:158"/>
to this of hunting, and regard not to profit in any good ſtudy or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable trade of life. <hi>Eſaus</hi> hunting may ſeeme not to have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our preſent cuſtome, with kennels of bounds, but with bow and quiver, as it is noted, <hi>Chap.</hi> 25. But howſoever, he was ſet wholly upon ſports, and ſold himſelfe to that kinde of delight, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goe other things of better note and uſe. Surely then, it is a ſin to live voluptuouſly, to have none other calling but paſtimes and vaine ſports, to make that ones occupation, that ſhould be alone his recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to ſpend himſelfe in ſuch a trifling vaine thing that ſhould be uſed as a triflle alone, to refreſh our ſelves after matters of greater conſequence. <hi>Nimrod</hi> was an hunter, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was an archer, <hi>Eſau</hi> a field man; you reade no ſuch thing of <hi>Sem, Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob.</hi> Why ſhould you follow the patterne of thoſe men whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaketh of with diſgrace? and not theirs rather, who have an honourable name in the book of God. I pray you call your ſelves to an account for your expence of time, muſt we not anſwer to God how we have lived, how we have beſtowed our dayes and houres, will this be a good anſwer? I ſpent the day in hunting, hawking, carding, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and ſo I did from time to time, one day at one ſport or merry meeting, another, at another, but all in ſuch toyes; Can you bee ſo fond as to imagine or beleeve, that God for this cauſe gave you wit, ſences, lives, health, ſtrength, wealth, and other like meanes of doing good?</p>
            <p>See this fault now, ſo many as are guilty, and ſet your ſelves to a more profitable kinde of living, or elſe the day will come when you ſhall bootleſly wiſh that you had never been; O ſo lay out your life, that the world and your ſelves may be the better for it. Live as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> did, not as <hi>Eſau,</hi> follow ſome ſtudy, follow ſome good husbandry.</p>
            <p>Live, as thoſe that know there is another life after this, and that there be more weighty and honourable things to doe than playing and ſporting: Take heed of bringing your ſelves into the number of thoſe that are <hi>Lovers of pleaſures, more than lovers of God.</hi> If you ſay, why? Then do you condemne all uſe of ſports, as hunting, fowling, or the like?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, no. I doe not, but I ſay, let not this in a manner be the totall ſumme of your employment. Have figures, as well as cyphers in the number of your dayes, let theſe kindes of exerciſes have ſome ſmall quantity of time for your refreſhment, but ſpend your ſelves in better things, or elſe you ſhall be cenſured with S. <hi>Iames</hi> his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>You have lived in pleaſure upon earth,</hi> and then I am ſure you ſhall live in torment when you muſt leave the earth.</p>
            <p>But another fault we have in <hi>Eſau,</hi> for the manner of his hunting,<note place="margin">2. He follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hunting over-eagerly.</note> ver. 29. <hi>He came from the field, and was faint,</hi> he followed his paſtime over-eagerly and exceſſively, and knew not how to breake it off in due time, till very hunger and faintneſſe brought him home. Sure
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27208:159"/>
reaſon will conclude that it muſt needs be folly and a ſin to be ſo bound to ſome ſport, that one knowes not a due ſeaſon of leaving it off, but muſt run after it a long time together, till faintneſſe or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger follow. To be eager after paſtimes, and ſtay ſo long at them as if they were great matters, even till extreame wearineſſe and hunger take one off, and rather compell, than perſwade him to leave, this is an inordinate uſing of ſports. For theſe recreations are in the very wiſdome of nature appointed alone to cheere up the minde, when it is wearied with great imployments, that it may be fitted the better for them afterwards: and they are not to be followed for their own ſakes, as not being worthy to bee made any part of the end of a wiſe mans life. Now he that follows them with ſo immoderate eagerneſſe, and ſo long together, makes it appeare that he doth not uſe them as their nature requireth, and inſtead of fitting himſelfe for better actions by them, doth altogether unfit himſelfe for any good action. For what can he performe well, that hath toiled himſelfe in a toy till hee bee quite ſpent?</p>
            <p>Learne I pray you to ſee this fault in your ſelves, and amend it, even ſtaying too long at your gawdes, following them ſuch a ſpace of time together, or with ſuch great violence, that you be even tired and ſpent by them. Sports muſt be done ſportingly, not with the like ſeriouſneſſe, and earneſtneſſe, as ſerious matters. A ſmall deale of time ſhould be allotted for matters of ſmall value, for ſeeing time is precious, to give much of a precious thing for that which is a very meane and worthleſſe thing, is ſurely to ſuffer ones ſelfe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by fancy and paſſions, and not to walke rationally, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly.</p>
            <p>Learne therefore not to ſuffer your ſelves to be brought under the bondage of any the moſt lawfull recreation, but to be able to breake off ſeaſonably.</p>
            <p>And when is the ſeaſon, ye may ask?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, when you have beſtowed ſo much time in them, as to have attained the proper end of them. As in meate and drink, a man ſhould forbear to take more, when he hath received ſo much as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the ends of food. So in ſports.</p>
            <p>And every mans diſcretion will tell him, unleſſe he hath put out his eyes by making himſelfe a bondman to paſtimes, that the end is to fit him for better matters, by preſerving the health, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vigour and cheerefulneſſe of his body and minde. He muſt not tarry at them as long as he can, or till he be weary; but when he hath been ſo long conſtant in them as is fit to ſtir and exerciſe his body, and prepare him for ſerious matters, then muſt he leave them off, and goe to ſerious matters. And I pray you, let me propound to your conſiderations a fit rule for the meaſuring of your time for ſports. Will not ſanctified reaſon tell you that you ought not to beſtow more time in recreations, though never ſo honeſt, to refreſh
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:27208:159"/>
your bodies then in ſpirituall and holy duties to edifie your ſoules. Give not more houres uſually to theſe baſeſt of all things, playes and games than to thoſe moſt uſefull of all things, reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Prayer, Meditations, and thoſe things that are next to ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all duties in value and uſefulneſſe, ſtudying ſome worthy knowledge, or doing ſome profitable buſineſſe in your callings. Let not the more worthy thing be ſet behinde the leſſe worthy: let not the Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall be ſet above his Soveraign, and have more honour than his Lord and King.</p>
            <p>Another fault in <hi>Eſau</hi> in regard of his converſation about earthly things is, that when he came now to be an ageder man,<note place="margin">3. He made himſelf great by war.</note> and ſaw it vain to follow paſtime, he fell, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> tels him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.40. <hi>By thy ſword ſhalt thou live.</hi> He made himſelfe great by war. The ſword was not appointed to get lands and livings withall, but to defend and maintaine men againſt unjuſt violence, and to puniſh offenders and malefactors. But <hi>Eſau</hi> followed the wars to make himſelfe great, as it hath been uſed much formerly, and is now. Men would fight with others to take away their lands and goods from them, and to make themſelves poſſeſſours and Lords of their countries, to get riches, command, and glory, and make themſelves great in worldly reſpects, they would betake themſelves to weapons and fighting. This is, ſo far as I can diſcern, a fault and ſin, I ſay, to take occaſion of warring, and making battailes, to win mens lands and goods from them.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, how was this a part of <hi>Iſaacs</hi> bleſſing to <hi>Eſau,</hi> if it were a ſinne?</p>
            <p>I anſwer; <hi>Iſaacs</hi> meaning is, to relate what outward proſperity <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould have: ſo that he doth not juſtifie all the meanes he ſhould uſe to make himſelfe great, but alone ſhewes, that he ſhould be great, and obtain a gallant countrey. It is a kinde of temporall bleſſing to overthrow in war, and to conquer, though one deale not juſtly in that matter of war. Indeed if men may live by their ſword, where is the rule of equity, <hi>Doe you as you would bee done by;</hi> where is the following after peace? which all are commanded to follow with all. Where is that threat, or curſe become? Which <hi>David</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth from God by way of juſt imprecation againſt ſuch, <hi>Scatter the people that delight in war:</hi> Such kinde of war as is enterprized to make a living of, and to get away other mens poſſeſſions; for elſe to fight Gods battailes, as <hi>Ioſuah</hi> and <hi>David</hi> did, in purſuing them with the ſword which were Gods enemies, and whom he appointed to be ſo purſued, is a good thing and honourable; and ſuch as thoſe worthy men before named did much delight in. So then to make warres and ſtirres, by invading others, and picking and ready accepting any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of quarrell for the raiſing of a Monarchie or Principalitie to himſelfe, is a ſinne, and, ſo farre as I ſee it, was <hi>Eſaus</hi> ſinne, who by his ſword made himſelfe owner of ſuch a Countrie, as within a little time his poſteritie was raiſed to a great Kingdome; for he diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:27208:160"/>
the inhabitants of Mount Seir, and erected the beginning of the kingdome of <hi>Edom.</hi> Indeed, to live by ones ſword, or by his wits, may well diſpute for the precedency in ſinfulneſſe. The one cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, the other kils, the one uſeth ſecret tricks, the other open force. The one armeth it ſelfe with fraud, the other with violence. The one hurts men in goods, the other in life too; the one will have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can over-reach you in wit, the other becauſe he can over-maſter you in ſtrength; the one careth not ſo he can beguile you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he have iuſt title or no, the other careth not ſo he can beate you, whether his title be good or not; the one breaketh the eighth and ninth Commandements, the other the eighth and ſixth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: never a better of them, but that the worſe, which is joined with more crueltie and bloudineſſe. And <hi>Eſau</hi> had a kind of preſage of his fierce and bloudie nature, when he looked ſo red at his very birth, and when he was affected with the red colour of the pottage, ſo red, ſo red, in reſpect whereof alſo his name began to be called <hi>Edom,</hi> which ſignifieth red.</p>
            <p>Here you may ſee what an erring judgement man hath ſince his fall, for how have men honoured Conquerours and great fighters, and ſouldiers; whereas if the war was entred into, not out of compulſion to defend, or out of juſtice to puniſh publike injuries againſt Cities, or Common-wealths, or Countries, it was meere robbery and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: they were but great Pyrates, and great Theeves, and great mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers; and yet the fooliſh blindneſſe of men will needs give them honour and good eſteeme.</p>
            <p>But I need not diſgrace war to you, only this you muſt note, that <hi>Eſau</hi> which gave himſelfe in his younger time to nothing elſe but ſports afterwards gave himſelfe to nothing elſe but war and ſpoiles.</p>
            <p>Oft voluptuous youth many times ends in an injurious old age.</p>
            <p>They ſet up themſelves by bad meanes at laſt, which gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to vanity and toyes before. Thus much of <hi>Eſaus</hi> converſation in reſpect of theſe earthly things: Now ſee his behaviour in reſpect of ſpirituall things.</p>

            <p>Firſt, in ſelling his birth-right.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in deſpiſing it, and that continually, and with great careleſneſſe; ſo ſhall you reade in the Story of <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.31, 32. The matter was thus, <hi>Eſau</hi> came hungry and faint from hunting, <hi>Iacob</hi> had made red pottage, <hi>Eſaus</hi> hunger made his eye apt to be taken with the lively colour of the red broth; he was as hungry men be, very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after food, and prayes his brother to give him a meſſe of the red pottage. <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sell me thy birth-right then,</hi> that is, paſſe over to me all thoſe priviledges that appertaine to thee as the elder brother, and on that condition I will give thee broth enough: <hi>Eſau</hi> thinkes,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:27208:160"/>
perhaps alſo he ſaid ſo too, I am going to die. I cannot conceive that he meanes, I am now ready for hunger to give up the ghoſt, and muſt needs die, if I have not inſtantly ſome of this food, for ſuch faintneſſe would ſcarce have given him leave to have entred into ſuch a parle, &amp; <hi>Iſaacs</hi> houſe, or ſome in it would have afforded the yong maſter ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to have kept him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtarving. But I ſuppoſe he meaneth, I muſt ſhortly die, &amp; the inheritance that is to follow of this birthright, is of this land for many years hence, &amp; therfore this birth-right wil do me no good, and ſo he is content to ſell it, &amp; to confirm the bargain with an oath. Lo here is one act of prophanneſſe. He ſhews that he did not care for heaven &amp; life eternal, wherof that land was a type and figure, or that he did not take notice of it as a type and figure of heaven, and therefore is content to ſell it, as we uſe to ſpeak, dogcheap, for a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of meat, or a meſſe of pottage. To part with the things that are ſignes &amp; means of attaining eternall life, for the baſe &amp; trifling mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this life, &amp; if he cannot have both, to chooſe rather to have the earthly, &amp; let the ſpirituall go, lo this is I ſay prophanneſs. A ſetting of earthly trifling good things, as it were a meſs of good broth; before the ſignes and outward means of attaining life everlaſting, even thoſe things that ſhould do us ſpiritual good, by helping us to grace &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this I ſay is prophanneſſe, this is <hi>Eſaus</hi> offence. The birthright car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with it divers things, 1. The ſoveraignty &amp; chief government of the family. 2. The prieſthood alſo, and right to be as the miniſter of the whole family. 3. Here and in this caſe, intereſt to the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan. as a type of heaven, &amp; to the continuance of the viſible Church, and the meanes of grace and ſalvation in his poſterity &amp; family, all which were tranſlated to <hi>Iacob</hi> with the birthright. Now <hi>Eſau</hi> an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fellow, that gave himſelf to his Croſs-bow and ſports, he either had not informed himſelf of theſe matters, or did not heed them not conſider them, therefore he lets all goe for a good meſſe of pottage.</p>
            <p>Brethren, prophanneſſe is a fearfull ſin, I meane to have ſo little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of the outward meanes of ſalvation, as to part with them for a ſong as we ſay. But yet an higher degree of prophanneſſe. He went his way and deſpiſed his birth-right, he never conſidered of his folly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to repent heartily of it, and ſo to ſeek pardon, and (though not the recovering of his birth-right, yet) to bee ſtill admitted as a member of <hi>Iſaacs</hi> family, and ſo to enjoy the priviledges that were promiſed to him and his ſeed, but even deſpiſeth it, he cares not a pin for it, it never grieves nor troubles him that he had ſold it, let it go, as if it had been ſcarce ſo much worth as he paid for it. So the ſin is grievous, to deſpiſe and contemne as vain and uſeleſſe thoſe things that tend to bring unto us ſpirituall graces, and eternall life.</p>
            <p>Now brethren, be not many of you ſuch, that ſet light and deſpiſe the meanes of grace, you care not for the word of God, for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for praying, &amp;c. The leaſt outward benefit will make you part with theſe helps to life eternall, you think them not worth any thing,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:27208:161"/>
you can be perſwaded to part with them for any little gaine, or the like. Nay, do not ſome of you deſpiſe them? count it a folly to make ſo much adoe about them, and would not care a ruſh, if you ſhould never come at Word, or Sacrament more, never uſe prayer any more. If any bee ſo diſpoſed, as the lives of many ſhew they be, let them conſider that they ſhall in vain dreame of having the bleſſing, even the ſpirituall bleſſing of Gods favour, and life eternall: <hi>Eſau</hi> could not prevaile by any teares and intreaties to have his Father give him a ſpirituall bleſſing, God by feare ſtrengthened <hi>Iſaacs</hi> heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all his intreaties. It may ſeem he would fain have had the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which carries with it a ſpirituall bleſſing, ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed notion it is like he had of heaven, that muſt be given to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> children, and that muſt go along in the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and their ſeed, this he would fain have had, and in a fit weepes hard, and did much deſire to make his Father repent of his being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and bleſſing <hi>Iacob,</hi> but he could not prevaile. If himſelfe had ſought at Gods hand to give him repentance for his prophanneſſe and other ſins, he ſhould not have been rejected; but that was not the thing he ſought alone, he would have had his Father to have changed his minde, and given him aſſurance of heaven. Such a confuſed deſire of heaven may be found in the heart of a profane man, but when in this maner they would inherite the blſſing, they ſhall not. They that care not for the birth-right, ſhall miſſe of the bleſſing; they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the outward ſigns &amp; means of life eternall, ſhall never attain life eternall. A profane man, a contemner of religion &amp; religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of God, ſhall never go to heaven without amendment; O if any of you be ſuch, now let <hi>Eſaus</hi> example ſtir you up to repentance, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and be no more profane, as was <hi>Eſau.</hi> But 2. ſtir up your ſelves to be truly devout, make great account of Gods Ordinances, to which he hath annexed the promiſe of life. Make high account of the Sacraments, Word, Prayer. Theſe be his Ordinances, to have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and injoyment of them, is to have the birth-right: O eſteeme them highly for that excellent purpoſe to which they are aſſigned, &amp; ſeek grace in them, that you may attaine ſalvation by them, which thoſe that do, are followers of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and not of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and ſhall ſpeed as <hi>Iacob.</hi> But the laſt act of profanneſſe in <hi>Eſau</hi> was worſt of all: He leaves the land of Canaan, and of his owne accord goes away to Mount Seir from <hi>Iacob,</hi> becauſe he found it not ſo commodious an habitation. He and his brother could not dwell together there, &amp; he would not dwell in Tents as <hi>Iſaac</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacob,</hi> to ſhew himſelf an heir through hope of the ſame promiſes, &amp; ſo this was an utter forſaking of all care of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, &amp; turning meer worldly and earthly. O take heed that none of you ſuffer profaneneſs to take ſo ſtrong a hold, and ſettle ſo deep root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in you, that you ſhould quite and cleane give over all ſhew of piety, and follow the world wholly altogether and profeſſedly.</p>
            <p>He is profane that hath no great care of heaven, at leaſt not at all to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:27208:161"/>
get grace, and therefore firſt makes no great reckoning of, next deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and after relinquiſheth, and caſteth off the ſignes and meanes of grace that God hath appointed. O let not any of you be ſuch, periſh not after the example of <hi>Eſaus</hi> naughtineſſe, but let his badneſſe teach you to feare to be bad in the ſame kinde, and labour to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, holy, and religious, that you may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Yet more faults muſt be ſpoken of,<note place="margin">5. He ſhewed not due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Parents.</note> towards his Father and Mother he did not ſhew that due reſpect which he ought unto them, for he married Cananitiſh wives, againſt their good liking you may be ſure which proved an heart-breaking unto them, and when he thought to mend the matter in ſuper-adding the daughter of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> he went yet in the ſame roade that before, not craving their advice and counſell, but did it of his own head, which though be were now married, hee ſhould not have done ſo long as he lived, as then it may ſeeme he did live under their roofe. Beware you children of this ſin of <hi>Eſau,</hi> wrong not the authority of God and your parents both, by marrying without their conſent, liking, or privity; whether is it ſafe, better, &amp; more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to be <hi>Iacobs</hi> imitators or <hi>Eſaus?</hi> but of that I have ſpoken already.</p>
            <p>Another rank of faults ſee towards his brother. Firſt,<note place="margin">6. He falſely accuſed his brother.</note> he accuſeth him for beguiling him of his birth-right, which was a falſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for he could not couzen him of that, but himſelf out of a profane ignorance and contempt of the worth thereof, ſold it away for a poore price, a meſſe of pottage. But man is ever ready to caſt the blame of his faults upon others, if they have any colour ſo to do, it were better plainly to confeſſe and take the blame unto ones ſelf, than to double the fault by covering it with falſhood ſpringing from ſelf-love: Let no man ſay, that another hath deceived him of that which he hath fondly caſt away, or the like. But when <hi>Iacob</hi> had indeed beguiled him of the bleſſing, which I cannot tell how to excuſe, then he hated him.</p>
            <p>It is a grievous offence to be ſo imbittered,<note place="margin">7. He hated his brother.</note> ſpecially againſt a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or kinſman, as to entertain hatred againſt him. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy neighbour in thine heart, Love your enemies, do good to them that do evill to you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. This is far from being like God, and ſo from being a fruit of the Spirit of Chriſt, who loved his enemies. Should not the Image of God in a man prevaile more to make one love, than his own injury to make him hate. If any of you be an <hi>Eſauite</hi> in this thing, an hater of one that hath done him wrong, let him be aſſured that it is a great ſin, and if he excuſe it, defend it, deny it, will not ſee it, not carefully reſiſt it, let him be aſſured that his ſin is not pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>He that ſaith he loveth God, and hateth his brother, is a lyar:</hi> and hee that ſaith he is a childe of God, and is not a lover of God, is a lyar too.</p>
            <p>You may ask me what it is to hate ones brother? I anſwer.</p>
            <p>There is a paſſion of hatred, and a habit of hatred, and both work in two degrees.</p>
            <p>The paſſion of hatred is a kinde of averſneſſe, and riſing of the heart againſt a man when one ſees him, ſo that hee cannot away
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:27208:162"/>
with him, nor can ſpeake unto, or looke curteouſly, or peaceably upon him, but ones countenance fals when he ſees him, and he even turnes away, and by his goodwill would have nothing to doe with him. To be ſo diſpoſed to a man in reſpect of his ſoule and wicked carriage, is not a ſin; but to be affected in reſpect of an injury, is this ſinfull hating of him. But the habit of hatred is, when the heart is ſo ſetled in this alienation and eſtrangement, that it grows to wiſh and deſire, and ſeeke his hurt; now ſometimes theſe paſſions, and theſe grudges be ſeen, lamented, reſiſted, and by degrees overcome; here hatred ruleth not: ſometimes a man will not ſee his ſin in ſuch hatred, and taketh no paines to chaſe this ſowre leaven out of his heart. This over-ruling hatred is a ſinne that cannot ſtand with true charity to God. O take heed of it, ſee it, amend it, and be no longer like <hi>Eſau!</hi>

He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the thought of killing his brother.</note>Next, he not alone intends to kill his brother, but comforts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that thought, as you may reade, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.44. It is a fearefull thing to reſolve upon murder, and that with delight and pleaſure, ſo that the heart concludeth to commit it ſo ſoone as ſuch and ſuch a let is removed, or fit occaſion offered, and that ſo ſetledly, as not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable obedience to God, but alone ſome meere reſpect to men doth hinder the accompliſhment. So the Phariſees reſolved to kill Chriſt, only fearing the people they forbeared; it was glad newes to them when <hi>Iudas</hi> offered his ſervice to betray him. This is to give ones ſelfe over as a ſervant to ſin, and cannot be found in any childe of God, at leaſt, not uſually or often. Doe any of you ſinne thus in any kinde? What ſhould I call you but <hi>Eſaus?</hi> and I beſeech you to take heed of malice, that it may not produce murther, and of all the inward motions to evill with allowance, for feare they produce the groſſeſt acts of evill. Nay, <hi>Eſaus</hi> malice ſtrived twenty yeares in his breaſt, for he went out againſt his brother when he returned from <hi>Padan Aram, Gen.</hi> 22. with foure hundred men after him, minding to deſtroy him, but that God vouchſafed to ſtop him by putting a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of kindeneſſe upon him. A great ſin it is to attempt greivous offences, though one be ſtopped in the middeſt, yea though the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page grow from ſome inward motion in himſelfe; for this ſhewes that the heart was once fully bent unto it; but if ſome outward hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance alone have been the cauſe of its not being done, then the thankes of forbearance is leſſe.</p>
            <p>Repent therefore of ſuch purpoſes and attempts, and ſhew your ſelves truly ſorrowfull and penitent, by confeſſing to God the ſin of attempting, and bleſſing his name for not permitting you to follow your wicked deſires.</p>

            <p>Had he been of a ſuſpitious and uncharitable diſpoſition, he would have paſſed a bitter ſentence both upon <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebekkah,</hi> and thought this, without doubt this woman is a light woman, and this man a libidinous and inceſtuous man, that ſhews ſuch geſtures to his ſiſter, who did alſo entertaine him, but be thinketh rather, ſurely the man is ſo good a man that he would never have been bold to beare himſelfe ſo amorouſly towards his ſiſter, and therefore, though hee ſaid ſhe was his ſiſter, for feare or other conſiderations, yet verily ſhe is his wife.</p>
            <p>We muſt be as charitable in our cenſures of men, as was this <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> and not take leave to thinke the worſt of any mans actions, but favourably interpret them, and make the faireſt conſtruction of them that may be. But to be harſh in our ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſures of any man, &amp; think he is naught, he meaneth wickedly, this is a teſtimony of a heart guilty of as bad ſins in himſelfe, and of one deſirous to hide his owne eyes from his owne badneſſe, by meaſuring others by himſelfe. For he that is himſelfe ready to doe evill, is prone to conclude, that others are as bad as himſelfe; and therefore, when he ſees them doe ſuch a thing as may poſſibly be meant to an evill purpoſe, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth preſently, that ſo it is. For he will not thinke better of others, than himſelfe, and therefore will reſolve that they have done as ill as he findes that himſelfe would have done in like caſe.</p>

               </note>Another good thing in this <hi>Abimelech</hi> is, that ſo ſoone as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was <hi>Rebekkahs</hi> husband, and ſhe his wife, he goes to him preſently, and tels him, ſaying, <hi>Sure ſhe is thy wife, why then ſaidſt thou, ſhe is my ſiſter, for one of the people might lightly have lien with thy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:27208:164"/>
wife, and thou ſhouldſt have brought upon us guiltineſſe.</hi> This is a good thing, and agreeable to the commandement of the Law, to tell our brother plainly of his ſin. If any man ſhall do ſome unlawfull thing to our knowledge, we muſt goe and enquire why they did ſo, and even rebuke them for it by ſhewing them how hurtfull or miſchievous it was, or might have proved.</p>
            <p>So did another <hi>Abimelech,</hi> or this ſame to <hi>Abraham</hi> before, they therefore have not walked rightly, that if they know any fault by their brother, keep the matter to themſelves, and entertaine hard conceits of them, but ſpeake no word of reproofe or admonition to them. So did <hi>Abſalom</hi> behave himſelfe towards his brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> when he had ſinned in forcing his ſiſter. This proveth, that they doe not deſire their brothers amending, and that they are more diſpleaſed with the perſon than the ſin, and if it be a wrong, with the injury done againſt themſelves, than with the offence done againſt God. If any of you have thus ſtored up the faults of another in his breaſt, to breed alienation of heart, and evill conceits againſt them, he muſt humble himſelfe for ſuch uncharitableneſſe: And now, you muſt learne to be bold and free in this behalfe, as <hi>Abimelech.</hi> Indeed you ſee him not bitter nor violent, but he is plaine and duly round with him; ſo muſt we learne to forbeare diſtempered ſpeeches and geſtures, but a plaine laying open of the fault before the offendor, is neceſſary to bring him to the ſight of his fault, and to a free confeſſion, and at leaſt to an outward reformation. Looke that you carry your ſelves thus hereafter to your offending brethren, and if they repent not at the firſt, doe it againe and againe, till you have brought them to an end or proved them incorrigible.</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſhews in his words evidently,<note place="margin">

Be you as good as he ſhewes himſelfe, know that adultery is a great ſin, that it ſhall bring guiltineſſe and puniſhment upon you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore terrifie your ſelves from committing it: Why ſhould wee Chriſtians be of leſſe knowledge, and have leſſe conſcience, leſſe feare to offend God, leſſe faith in his juſtice then this Philiſtian had? Why ſhould we be bold to run into that crime which he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with <hi>Iſaac</hi> for miniſtring occaſion of doing unwittingly? Why ſhould we flatter our ſelves with hope of impunity for ſuch a ſin as he did certainly beleeve would bring guiltineſſe upon the committer? Conſider with your ſelves, whether you have not been ſo blinded and hardened with the deceitfulneſſe of ſin, as knowingly, and of purpoſe to ruſh into the evill which an Heathen man was feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to commit.</p>

               </note>Againe, it is well done of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> that he by a firſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement ratified with a threat of death, charged that no man ſhould dare to wrong this man or his wife: He was a King, and had power to make ſuch an edict, and for the ſecuring of <hi>Iſaac</hi> againſt his feares, and preventing any evill, publiſheth it to his people.

But if love of their religion and piety make us deſire the friendſhip of any, then it is a good ſigne, that the ſame piety and vertue is found in him whom it winneth to beare good will unto the profeſſour of it: for vertuous men are ſeldome loved, and never for vertues ſake, but by thoſe that have ſome vertue.

Beware of committing the like offence, ſhew not ill will towards any good man, by chaſing him from you, refuſing to give him leave to be with you, or in generall, by any diſcurteous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards him. But be rather glad of his ſociety and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:27208:166"/>It is a wrong to God in that we ſatisfie not our ſelves in his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of things, for may not God ſhew more or leſſe favour to men as it ſeemeth good to himſelfe? and why, ſhould our eye be evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his eye is good? It is a wrong to the perſon envyed, in that we do not ſo behave our ſelves towards him, as we would that all other ſhould doe to our ſelves, for men would that others ſhould rejoyce in their welfare, and not repine at it. Secondly, in that it maketh us apt to doe them any injurie, as here is ſeene in the Example that we ſpeake of, who ſtopped <hi>Iſaacs</hi> Wells out of envy. And it is a wrong to ones ſelfe, in that he bringeth needleſſe vexation upon himſelfe, and filleth his heart with gall, when he might have fed on honey as it were; for we ſhould rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and then we ſhould partake of the benefit; becauſe the beſt fruit of a good thing is to have joy of it.</p>
            <p>And this envy ſpringeth from meere ſelfe-love, and pride, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in not ſeeing God in things, and ſubmitting to his wiſdome. Whoſoever findeth a kinde of tangue of this diſeaſe in himſelfe, muſt blame himſelfe for it heartily, and thinke thus with himſelfe, What ſhall I be an imitatour of wicked men, yea of the wicked ſpirits? What a fooliſh man am I that will not ſee Gods wiſe providence and yeeld to it? What a wretch, that thinke all good things loſt which fall beſides my ſelfe? What a fooliſh man that will make a croſſe to my ſelfe where it need not bee, nor indeed is? And if any thinke, if hee had not this proſperity it might befall mee, and therefore at leaſt I may grieve that he hath it to my dammage.</p>
            <p>I anſwer.</p>
            <p>That is but a very May-be, for it will not follow that the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims would have growne very rich, if <hi>Iſaac</hi> had not gotten ſo much, nor that <hi>Cain</hi> ſhould have been accepted if <hi>Abel</hi> had not; Yea verily, thoſe things that have moved God not to grant them ſo much proſperity as another, would have cauſed him to withdraw it from them, even though he had not given it to that other. For God doth not forbeare to give to this perſon, becauſe he gave to that; this kinde of abſtaining to give is proper to men, who want ſufficient meanes to give to all, but God can repleniſh all without leaving himſelfe deſtitute: but God with-holds his benefits from thoſe that have them not, becauſe their ſins provoke him, or becauſe hee would afflict or chaſtiſe them.</p>
            <p>The faults of men keep good things from their poſſeſſions, and they would not have been leſſe faulty, if another had been leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous. Wherefore I ſay, confeſſe this ſin, ſee it, condemne it in your ſelves, yeeld not to it.</p>
            <p>Yea but I am ſure that his getting hinders my gaines.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Firſt, ſay that it doth, wilt thou be vexed that another hinders thee? Is not this to be vexed at Gods providence?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:27208:166"/>But ſecondly, I anſwer, thou canſt not be ſure of this, for God could and if he purpoſed to croſſe thee, deny thee ſuch benefits, though this man were not.</p>
            <p>Now I pray you, hate and abhorre envy, and learne to rejoyce with them that rejoyce, rather then torment your ſelves at them, and to bee thankfull to God for ſhewing favour to your neighbours, rather then to fret in your ſelves. Indeed if we ſee wicked men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, wee muſt beware of over-grieving, leſt it make us fall to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating: But to grieve at the proſperity of an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> is to ſhew, that one loveth not goodneſſe, as a reward of which the Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth that proſperity.</p>
            <p>Now ſecondly, when they had entertained envy,<note place="margin">Cha. 26.15. 2. They wronged him.</note> then they fall to injury; They ſtopped his Wels, and filled them with duſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The Wells his Father had dugge; Loe, a wickedneſſe; to doe injury to another, by hurting and hindering him, though ones ſelfe can reape no benefit by it. Indeed to doe a neighbour hurt in body or goods without juſt cauſe (<hi>viz.</hi> puniſhing him for ſome fault by vertue of authority which God hath put into my hand) is a great ſinne, and againſt the plaine Law that ſaith, <hi>Doe as you would be done by,</hi> and that Commandement, <hi>Bee innocent as Doves;</hi> but to hurt a man without any profit to himſelfe, this is an high degree of wickedneſſe, and proceeds from nothing elſe but envy, which is one of the worſt kindes of malice. To advantage my ſelfe by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans loſſe is moſt unjuſt, but to hinder another without any advantage to my ſelfe, this is a farre more palpable and wilfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
            <p>O call to minde your owne wayes, haue not you walked as croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly as theſe men of the Philiſtime Nation? Stopped up another mans Wels as it were, that is, put your ſelves to paines to doe him dammage, to hinder him, though you get nothing by it your ſelves. This is a plaine proofe of a man ſtuffed with envy, and with great wickedneſſe, whereby he loves to doe evill, even for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſake he taketh in doing, not for any other fruit of it. This is to be juſt like the devill, that ſeeketh to keepe others out of heaven, and to bring them to hell, though it eaſe not his torments one whit, becauſe it a little ſatisfieth his ſtomack. Repent, repent exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if you have been ſo devilliſh.</p>
            <p>Another fault of the Philiſtims you meete with. <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.19,<note place="margin">Ver. 19, 20, 21.</note> 20, 21. <hi>Iſaac digged a Well in the valley, and found there a fountaine of living water:</hi> that is, ſuch as did run with a full and conſtant ſtreame,<note place="margin">3. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with him.</note> 
               <hi>And the Shepheards of Gerar contended for it with Iſaacs Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, ſaying, the water is ours.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Iſaac</hi> called the name of it <hi>Hezek,</hi> or ſtrife, becauſe they ſtrove with him. Then they digged another Well, and they ſtrove for that alſo, and he called the name of it <hi>Sitnah,</hi> which ſignifieth hatred or enmity, becauſe he ſaw that they contended with him now, not for need of the water,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:27208:167"/>
but out of meere hatred, becauſe they were enemies and adverſaries to him, and were grieved at his welfare.</p>
            <p>The fault is (you ſee) contentiouſneſſe, and ſtrife, growing out of hatred and ill will. The nature of man is full of this vice, as S. <hi>Paul, Filled with envy, murther, debate.</hi> Rom. 1.9. and <hi>Hatred, variance, emulation, ſtrife, ſedition,</hi> are reckoned among the fruits of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. S. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the Corinths; <hi>Left that when he commeth unto them, he ſhall finde amongst them</hi> (with other ſinnes) <hi>debates, and ſtrife.</hi> This ſtrife hath its originall in pride, which eaſily breedeth envy, and hatred, and ſo contention and ſtrife; and S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>That thoſe which have envying and ſtrife among themſelves, this wiſdome is not from above, but is earthly, ſenſuall, and devilliſh,</hi> and that <hi>where envying and ſtrife is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 3. ult. and chap. 4.1.</note> 
               <hi>there is confuſion, and every evill worke.</hi> He ſaith alſo, <hi>That wars and fightings are amongst them, from their luſts that war in their members.</hi> You ſee the loathſomeneſſe of this vice, from the bad cauſes and effects of it.</p>
            <p>Take notice therefore of your owne hearts and lives, and ſee if none of you bee a quarellous and contentious perſon; that is, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy upon every occaſion to ſtrive with his brother, and to breake forth into brawles and ſuits, challenging that which is none of his, and diſquieting his brethren and himſelfe.</p>
            <p>A man may uſe legall meanes to get and keepe that which is rightfully due to him, but he muſt not doe this in a froward man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with bitterneſſe and rage againſt his adverſary; but for the things that appertaine not to him in equity, hee muſt make no ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at all, otherwiſe he is a contentious man. And becauſe ſelfe-love maketh us ſo blinde, that wee are apt to deceive our ſelves, and to imagine we have good title to that which indeed belongs not to us, wee muſt bee content to referre our ſelves willingly to other mens judgements, and not ſtand upon our owne opinions; I mean to other indifferent, and unintereſted perſons, whoſe judgements are like to bee clearer than our owne, in things wherein themſelves be not ingaged.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore commend peace and concord, let nothing bee done of ſtrife, in an humour to croſſe and oppoſe another, or to vexe and anger him. If covetouſneſſe or envy rule in a mans heart, hee will boile with contention, and flame forth into debates and ſtrifes; but if he have an heart contented with his eſtate, and charitably diſpoſed to his brethren, hee will then inſue peace, and follow after it. For a juſt controverſie may bee carried in a quiet and peaceable manner, and ſo ought to be; but be the cauſe of ſtriving never ſo equall, if the thing be carried, tumultuouſly with bitter words and behaviour, with railings, ſwellings, whiſperings, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings, mutuall, diſgracing and upbraiding one another, this is a ſigne of a naughty heart, in whom the wiſdome that is from below doth rule and beare ſway.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:27208:167"/>Reſolve therefore to follow peace with all men, not ſtriving but upon juſt cauſe and then alſo in a loving, gentle, and milde man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And ſo much for <hi>Iſaacs</hi> contemporaries, with whom his occaſions gave him cauſe of intermingling.

            <p>Of <hi>Iacob</hi> we muſt ſhew three things, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Examples. His birth, life, and death.</p>
            <p>Concerning his birth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> his birth</note> the time and parents were the ſame which we noted before of <hi>Eſau,</hi> the manner was as you have heard, as if hee had wreſtled with his brother for the birth-right even in the birth; in which may ſeem to be ſignified the great ſtir that ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their Succeſſours as well as themſelves, yea, and betwixt the good and bad in all ages, even thoſe that are heires of the promiſe, and thoſe that be contemners of the promiſe. For the Lord had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that two Nations were in <hi>Rebekkahs</hi> wombe, which ſhould be ſeparated one from the other, and in them the Lord did manifeſt the freedome of his Election, ſeeing he choſe the younger before the elder to inherite the promiſes, and that before they had done good or evill, that the purpoſe of God according to election might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine (or be firme) not of workes, but of him that calleth: meaning,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:27208:169"/>
that Gods intention of ſaving by his grace, who freely calleth, not of any workes in any perſon, whether repenting, beleeving, or any other workes, might be ſtedfaſt and ſtable. No workes cauſe God to call one, or to purpoſe to call one, or not to call another, but alone his good pleaſure, whereof though it be ſure that God hath in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe juſt reaſon (for he is a reaſonable agent, and doth all things, and moſt underſtandingly) yet he ſees it not good to reveale to us any reaſon, becauſe he would make us ſee what ſubjection we owe to him (that is to ſay) to reſt in his will as a ſufficient reaſon to ſatisfie us. God might have purpoſed to call, and alſo have called all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any picking or chooſing, or preferring one before another, but his purpoſe was according to election or choice, he intended not to raiſe up all out of the miſerable eſtate into which <hi>Adam</hi> brought all, but alone ſome; and in his chooſing he might have left whom he tooke, and contrarily, but he would take ſome, not all, and theſe, not thoſe becauſe in his wiſdome he ſaw it fit; and ſo great is his power and ſoveraignty, that we ought to be contented with this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, God would have it ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What Gods election is.</note>Gods Election is his purpoſe to call ſuch and ſuch, leaving the reſt: and of this purpoſe we can give no other cauſe but this, ſo it ſeemed good unto him: though himſelfe have ſuch grounds of his choice within himſelfe, as it is fit for a wiſe agent to have for the ground of all his actions.

               <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.27. <hi>Iacob was a plaine man, and did dwell in Tents,</hi> The word tranſlated a plaine man, ſignifieth a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or upright man.<note place="margin">
                  <p n="1">1. In generall:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was an upright man.</p>
               </note> It is of larger ſignification than that phraſe of ours, <hi>A plaine man,</hi> for that in common ſpeech noteth one that is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and dealeth ſquarely and eavenly without fraud, deceit, guile, or any tricks in his actions, ſo may one be and have no great goodneſſe in him. But this word is uſed to denote an upright hearted man, a truly and intirely godly man, a perfect man that is good within as well as without, and good in all things, at all times, and in all places one as well as another, one that carefully follows all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, not giving himſelfe leave to ſwerve from any of Gods wayes at any time.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is.</note>Perfection is that property in things, by which they have all which is requiſite for their due conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">It is twofold.</note>There is a double perfection, one of degrees, unattainable in this life, and it is when a man hath all the parts of obedience in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree that the Law requireth of him, this is a legall perfection,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:27208:169"/>
without which no man can be juſtified before God by the Law, and becauſe no man can attain it, therefore, <hi>By the Law ſhall no fleſh be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,</hi> but beleevers have it in Chriſt, in whom they are made the righteouſneſſe or God, and to whom righteouſneſſe without workes (meaning workes of their own working, for they are ſuch as worke not in this ſenſe) is imputed.</p>
            <p>Perfection of parts, is when all the parts of goodneſſe are found in a man. As a childe of five yeares is a perfect man in reſpect of parts, he hath a ſoule, and body, he hath hands, head, heart, legs, &amp;c. and therefore is that way perfect, though ſtature and ſtrength, and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not found in him in the ſame degree that after, when he is a growne man.</p>
            <p>Now there are two kindes of parts found in every thing firſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the parts eſſentiall, as matter and forme.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the parts integrall, <hi>viz.</hi> as the ſeverall members of the matter, heart, head, &amp;c. in a man.</p>
            <p>So in the point of goodneſſe, goodneſſe is perfect when it hath all the parts of goodneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the matter, which is the act of doing good and leaving evils. 2. The forme, which is the ſubjection of the will to the will of God; in that a man is therefore carefull to leave evill and doe good, becauſe he acknowledgeth himſelf to owe, and is willing to performe all obedience unto God his maker and Redeemer, and theſe are the eſſentiall parts of goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>The integrall, are the doing of good in every kinde, and leaving of evill in every kinde, with an endeavour, and ſtriving, and wiſhing to doe it in every degree, even to leave all evill, the very leaſt degree, and to do all good in the very higheſt degree. Thus you ſee what perfection is. It is an endeavour and reſolution to doe all things which God commandeth, and to leave all the things which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth, perfectly in obedience to his authority; or if you will, in briefe, Perfection of the Goſpell is a ſtriving after the perfection of the Law. Now we muſt be thus perfect, becauſe it is a ſingular goodneſſe of God to accept ſuch an imperfect perfection at our hands. For he might have held us ſtill to the condition of workes, and ſo rejecting our endeavours, becauſe falling ſhort of what the Law requireth, might have deſtroyed us notwithſtanding ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, but he hath been pleaſed to make a new Covenant, in which he requireth and accepteth our hearty endeavours, though there be much failing. O ſhould not this move us to labour and ſtrive! As if a debtor owing an hundred pounds, and not able to pay it, ſhould have theſe conditions propounded to him from his Creditor, well, pay me what you be able, ſo you bring me good money, not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, and I will accept it. Should not this make them very carefull to bring him ſo much as they were able, and that in good ſilver, not copper and falſe coine? Againe, we loſe both our goodneſſe and our ſelves alſo, if we be not plaine and perfect; If we have reſpect to all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:27208:170"/>
Gods Commandements, and be found in Gods preſence, wee ſhall not be aſhamed: but confuſion will cover our faces at the end, if we ſatisfie our ſelves with hollow and defective goodneſſe; for a lame ſacrifice will not be acceptable on Gods Altar.</p>
            <p>Now I pray you let each of us conſider of himſelfe, whether he be ſuch a diſſembler, that hath little ſhew of piety, and is not pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. We muſt be followers of them that by patience and faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite the promiſes, and be ſuch as they that have gone to heaven, if our ſelves purpoſe to goe to heaven. And if you be not ſo, but openly ſinfull, or hollowly and diſſemblingly good; now ſee your miſery, you ſhall never be heires with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> if you labour not to be like unto them in this perfection. And the way to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is to ſee our want, and to pray to God to make us ſuch. Wee have him tyed by a juſt faithfull promiſe to fill the hungry, and to heare them that call upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. He was a skilfull, and able Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</note>Further it is ſaid, that <hi>Iacob</hi> dwelt in Tents, not only meaning that he was a man brought up to tend cattell, as they did that dwelt in Tents, (whereas <hi>Eſau</hi> was an huntſman firſt, and a ſouldier after,) but chiefly that he did not ſet himſelfe to ſeek great poſſeſſions, and faire palaces, and houſes in the world, but ſojourned in the land of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, as in a ſtrange countrey, dwelling in Tents with his Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as before him <hi>Abraham</hi> had done: which thing the Apoſtle taketh notice of, as a profeſſion of their being Pilgrims and Strangers upon earth, and ſeeking an enduring City.</p>
            <p>So here are two things obſervable, and imitable in <hi>Iacob;</hi> one, that he gave himſelf to tend cattell, and was a very skilfull and able Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, as appeared after, when he undertooke to tend his Father in lawes flocks.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Every one muſt follow ſome calling.</note>It is neceſſary that a man have ſome calling, ſome profitable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, by which he is able with the common benefit of others to maintain his own ſelfe and family, and to uphold his eſtate. It is a promiſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt eate the labour of thine hands.</hi> Loe, labour muſt get our food, elſe we have not the good mans bleſſing: <hi>In the ſweat of thy brow ſhalt thou get thy bread.</hi> This is a puniſhment, ſo far as it tendeth to inflict diſquietment and troubleſomeneſſe upon men in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but ſo far as it enjoyneth labour, it is not a puniſhment, but a precept: <hi>He that tilleth his ground ſhall have bread enough.</hi> Tilling of ones ground, that is, diligent following of ones honeſt calling is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and how ſhall a man follow that which he hath not? Alſo nature teacheth this plainly enough: the contrary alſo is full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the ſoule, expoſing a man to many temptations, and filling the heart with noyſome luſt, and making it harder to eſcape, and to walk in a Chriſtian manner of life. Wherefore thoſe that have imitated <hi>Eſau</hi> rather than <hi>Iacob,</hi> and have given themſelves to ſports and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo that they be not able to doe any thing for their maintenance, if need required, have much to anſwer for before God, and have brought

much miſery on themſelves, in regard they are in greater difficulty of being ſaved than other men, in giving Satan and fleſh an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great advantage againſt their ſoules: He that hath no cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is in danger to be a follower of idle companions, and the troupes of ſuch perſons leade not in the way to heaven. Therefore I call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all you that are Parents, and all you children that are come to yeares of diſcretion, requiring you to be carefull of your childrens education, and to traine them up for ſome due vocation and calling; and you children to be obſequious to your Parents in this behalfe, yeelding your ſelves to their directions; and this exhortation I would inforce not only upon the poorer ſort, whoſe belly craveth it of them, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, but even on the wealthier ſort too, whoſe ſoules I am ſure doe as much crave it of them. For there is no man of ſo great birth and blood, but that there is ſome noble ſtudy or other, and ſome honourable employment, wherein it will be to his honour to be skilfull and converſant. Men of place ſhould not need to be ſlaves to Dice, and Wine, and Harlots, and Sports, if they would be ſervants to God in ſome worthy vocation or other.</p>

               <hi>But</hi> Iacob <hi>dwelt in Tents:</hi> that is, lived as a Pilgrim or ſtranger,<note place="margin">3. He lived as a Pilgrim, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing himſelf an heire of the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </note> profeſſing himſelf an heire of the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Though we be not all bound to dwell in Tents, and to be Pilgrims in that ſence, yet we elſe are all bound to have our hearts withdrawne from earthly things, and ſet on heaven, to count this world and the things of it no better than a Tent or a Tabernacle, weake, fickle, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and ſo to carry our ſelves towards it, and to be in it, even as in a ſtrange countrey, not as in an habitation of our owne, in which wee meane to ſettle our ſelves. To behave our ſelves in the world as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and to the world and things thereof, as to a ſtrange place, through which we are travelling to our own country: This is a noble thing, a divine, a celeſtiall thing. A moſt remarkable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a true &amp; a falſe hearted Chriſtian, becauſe one hath the right, and the other contents himſelfe with counterfeit goodneſſe. Thus did our Lord Ieſus Chriſt live; thus <hi>Paul;</hi> thus all the Saints; and thus are we commanded to live, even as Pilgrims and ſtrangers. And it ſtands in this, that we make no reckoning of earthly things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of heavenly, and that we deſire earthly things none other way but in order to heavenly, and uſe earthly things only ſo, as to be furtherances to our earthly beeing, and doe not ſuffer them to ſteale away our affections from heaven, nor to hinder our diligent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practiſing of all thoſe things that doe directly concerne our heavenly eſtate. Thus to minde, not the things below, but the things above, is a ſure proofe of a man truly enlightned and ſanctified, and made conformable to the death and Reſurrection of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. In a word, it ſtands in eſteeming all earthly things as vanity and vexation of ſpirit, and uſing them all as furtherances to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall well-being, otherwiſe making none account of them at all.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:27208:171"/>
For ſo doth a ſtranger uſe the countrey wherein he travelleth, and all the things and perſons that he doth meet withall therein. Now let us make uſe to our ſelves of this great vertue, by blaming our owne ſelves for being ſo far unlike to <hi>Iacob</hi> in this matter. How farre we are from dwelling in Tents, and from behaving our ſelves as Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims in the world, is it not more than manifeſt? O how much eſteeme doe we make of worldly things and perſons? how are our hearts ſet upon them? how eagerly doe we follow them? how over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much doe we rejoyce in them! Certainly this argueth a great deale of folly. For to miſtake the worth and prices of things, is a ſpeciall point of folly; we doe for the moſt part live like men of the world, that are not acquainted with any things more excellent than the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this life: We thinke not of our mortality and uncertainty of earthly things, wee have our conſolation in earth, rather than heaven.</p>
            <p>This worldly mindedneſſe is to be obſerved, confeſſed, lamented, refuſed; we muſt blame our ſelves for it, as for a great fault, and muſt oppoſe it with ſerious meditations, of earth, and heaven, and of our mortality.</p>
            <p>We muſt earneſtly pray to God to divorce us from the world, and to pull our hearts upward, that we may not be glued as it were to this dirt and dung. To ſee this fault, is a ſigne of ſome true grace; for the world will not ſee it to be a fault, that they are over earneſtly bent unto the world; as the Fiſh findes it not troubleſome to live in the waters.</p>
            <p>And now let me call upon you, to be heavenly minded hereafter, to uſe this world as though you did not uſe it, to ſet it lower than ſpirituall graces, and than the hope of heavenly things. A childe is wedded to his gawdes ſo long as his childiſhneſſe prevaileth, but when he hath gotten more mature underſtanding, he rejecteth them, and mindes other things; ſo muſt we if we will ſhew our ſelves to be perfect men in underſtanding. If a maſter ſets his ſervant to gather chips, he doth it, and ſhould doe it diligently in obedience to his maſter; but ſtill he takes not the chips for excellent things, but reckons of them as of chips: ſo for conſcience ſake to God muſt we labour in the world, yet ſtill ſo, that we account the world as a vaine ſhadow, and muſt ſhew that we ſo eſteeme it, by being ſatisfied even with a ſmall portion, if God ſee it fit to give us no more; and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well contented if we have food and raiment; yea, and patient too, if we be put to ſuffer need, and want them.</p>
            <p>And ſo much now for <hi>Iacobs</hi> vertues in generall, <hi>He was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, and dwelt in Tents.</hi> Now let as conſider them more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let us ſee his carriage to God-ward, then to men-ward, both himſelfe and others, both thoſe that were neerer to him, and thoſe that were further from him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:27208:171"/>Firſt then, <hi>Iacob</hi> had true faith in God,<note place="margin">His ſpeciall vertues in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God. 1. Hee had faith, which he ſhewed by many fruits. Gen. 25.30.</note> a common grace which is found in all Gods people, and he ſhewed this faith by many comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and worthy fruits of faith; <hi>viz.</hi> theſe which the Story of the Bible noteth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by his deſire to get the birth-right, and to buy it of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who deſpiſed it; for, if it was a teſtimony of prophanneſſe and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> unbeliefe in <hi>Eſau,</hi> to ſell and ſleight his birth-right; then muſt it be alſo a proofe of holineſſe and faith in <hi>Iacob,</hi> to deſire it and buy it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were both young, and ſo <hi>Iacob</hi> gets it in a childiſh way, by giving his brother a meſſe of broth on that condition, that he would reſigne up to him all intereſt, right, and title unto it that he had, or might have: But yet in the main matter, <hi>Iacob</hi> beleeved Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for the ſpirituall benefits annexed to the birth-right, elſe he would not have ſought it in that manner. Graces worke in men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the age and ability of diſcretion that is found in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which hath them.</p>
            <p>There be certain childiſh and imperfect expreſſions of grace mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it were with the weakneſſe of head that is in children; yet be theſe true proofes of grace, and ſuch as the Lord accepts for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them; though the weakneſſes mixed with them deſerve no acceptation; and for the love of the good, he paſſeth by thoſe weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Sure had not <hi>Iacob</hi> beleeved the promiſes of God concerning the land of Canaan, and the reſt, he would never have tooke any care of the birth-right; but in that he doth long for it, and in ſuch a faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a young man could doe, contracts for it with his brother, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues his faith, which cauſed him ſo to eſteeme of it. Indeed it was not that bargaine betwixt them that made it his, but Gods promiſe before made to his mother, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the younger:</hi> but this affecting of it ſhewed that he had been taught by his mother this his intereſt; and that he was poſſeſſed with an earneſt deſire of getting it, which is the firſt fruit of his faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he deſired alſo, and highly eſteemed the bleſſing, as is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſeen in his condeſcending to his mothers motion of getting it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her advice. Here alſo weakneſſe diſcovered it ſelfe, but the deſire of attaining the bleſſing, ſhewed it ſelfe in this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the fruit of faith is to be allowed, though the corruption joyned with it be blame-worthy.</p>
            <p>Indeed, <hi>Eſau</hi> alſo had a deſire of the bleſſing, as appeareth by his earneſt entreaty, and teares to his Father, but <hi>Iacobs</hi> deſires looked more to ſpirituall things, <hi>Eſaus</hi> to earthly: So, the ones was a fruit of faith in Gods promiſes, the other a fruit of meere naturall love to ones ſelfe, by which every man would faine attaine that which hee thinkes would prove beneficiall.</p>
            <p>A third note and fruit of <hi>Iacobs</hi> faith, was his gratefull accepting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of Gods promiſes, when he appeared to him in a dreame,<note place="margin">Gen. 28.16.</note> as hee was going on his way; for he preſently tooke notice that Gods was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:27208:172"/>
there, and began to be reverently affected towards God, and was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to erect the ſtone for a Pillar, and to poure oyle upon it, which was nothing elſe but a thankfull expreſſion of his faith in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which alſo cauſed him to make the Vow following unto God, as you have it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.10. to the end. A thankfull and comfortable receiving of Gods promiſes, being cheared with them, as with things moſt certaine, proveth faith to the promiſe maker, and to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſhewing that a man is perſwaded they ſhall be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faile.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Further, <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhewed his faith in making choice of his wayes, when <hi>Laban</hi> would have him to continue looking to his ſheepe after the fourteene yeares of ſervice were paſt for his two daughters; for he deſired to have the ſpotted, ſpeckled, and browne cattell that ſhould fall after, for his wages: Shewing that he looked to God, whoſe hand alone could diſpoſe of this ſo abſtruſe and hidden a thing in the courſe of nature. Hee was willing to ſtand to Gods kindneſſe and love, rather than to any certain agreement with <hi>Laban;</hi> which hee would not have done, had he not beleeved Gods promiſes to bleſſe him and to encreaſe him, as was told him in his dreame fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. And therefore he tels his wives, that the Angell came to him in a dreame, and bad him looke on the Rammes leaping, the Ewes which brought forth the Lambes ſpotted and grizled, and ſo it was of God that he uſed the meanes of laying pilled ſticks in the troughes, at the time when the ſtronger cattell went to the Males.</p>
            <p>Let any man make triall of the ſame courſe now, and he ſhall not finde the ſame ſucceſſe. Such a ſight before the ingendring cattell will hardly cauſe the yong to be ſpotted; but that be did in faith, as having been I gueſſe, guided to it by the Angel, which bid him look and ſee the cattell bringing forth Lambes and Goats of that colour. And here is a good proofe, when a man can reſt himſelfe upon God for his wages, and for his meanes even in this world; and not upon his owne wiſdome, or any ſuch like outward thing. A man would have thought this a very uncertaine match, but <hi>Iacob</hi> ſtaying on Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, was deſirous of this way rather than any other to receive his reward by it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Laſtly, he ſhewed his faith in bleſſing the two ſons of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> yea, and all his owne, as a ſenſible declaration to his children that he did not make any doubt of their poſſeſſing that Land, according to Gods covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and promiſe to himſelfe often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
            <p>Now brethren, I pray you let us labour to give credit unto that which God ſpeaks to us, and reſt upon his goodneſſe for the gracious performance of his faithfull promiſes, which is the roote of all graces, and will cauſe us to live holily, if we once get it confirmed and ſtrengthened in our hearts; and let us labour to ſhew our faith by the ſame fruits that are to be ſeen in <hi>Iacob,</hi> as was before noted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:27208:172"/>Let us highly eſteeme thoſe ſignes of his goodneſſe, and meanes of attaining his ſpirituall benefits, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did of his birth-right. Let us make great account of his bleſſing, eſpecially ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in things concerning our ſalvation, whereof the Land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was a figure. Let us receive his promiſes with reverend joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and thankfulneſſe: Let us truſt upon him for our reward of any faithfull ſervice, in any kinde that we performe, labouring to bee perſwaded that he will ſee us requited abundantly, if men ſhould neglect us.</p>
            <p>A good man muſt truſt to Gods bleſſing on his labours, in things that depend upon his gracious providence, and the diſpoſition of things by it, rather than to any other courſe wherein his wit may ſeeme to make matters more certaine. Let us ſhew our faith by truſting alſo on God to bleſſe our children, and by leaving proofes even at our dying, that we be mindfull of heaven, and that we make no doubt but God will performe his promiſes. If our faith ſhew it ſelfe by theſe good effects, it is true; and wee muſt more and more ſee our weakneſſe in faith, by the contrary effects, and more and more labour to prove the truth and ſtrength of it too, by its more and more producing thoſe and the like effects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iacob</hi> alſo ſhewed his faith by running to God when <hi>Eſau</hi> came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> againſt him, and by praying to God to give his ſonnes favour in the fight of the man, and by offering to God when his ſons ſent for him: for to have recourſe to God ſtill in our needs, and make his name our refuge, is an excellent proofe of our faith in his promiſes.</p>
            <p>Now ſecondly, <hi>Iacob</hi> was a religious and devout man,<note place="margin">2. He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.</note> that was carefull to ſerve the true God, in the true exerciſes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as appeared in the particular duties of religion which hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he was prayerfull, and ready to call upon Gods name on all occaſions; when his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> met him, hee preſently framed himſelfe to call upon the name of God, as you have it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9. Where is alſo an excellent forme of prayer; for firſt, he layes downe the grounds of his boldneſſe to come to God in prayer, ſaying, <hi>God of my Father,</hi> that is, thou art my God in Covenant with me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeke I helpe of thee, and <hi>Thou ſaidſt unto me, returne;</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, I have thy word of Commandement and promiſe guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to this journey, therefore I ſeeke to thee.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, hee humbleth and abaſeth himſelfe before God, as unworthy any benefit, ſaying, <hi>I am leſſe than the leaſt, &amp;c.</hi> Then he makes his requeſt, <hi>Deliver me I pray thee, &amp;c.</hi> and confirmes it by the greatneſſe of the danger, and his inability to ſave himſelfe, procuring great feare, <hi>Whom I feare, &amp;c.</hi> and next, from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made unto him, <hi>Thou ſaidſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Loe here, a ſweet patterne for our prayers to God when we feare any croſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:27208:173"/>Firſt, remember the Covenant and promiſe of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the miſery, then humble our ſelves in acknowledgement of our unworthineſſe. So make our ſuits boldly, and make our moane to God of our dangers, and feares, and helpleſneſſe; and againe urge him with his promiſes. Had not <hi>Iacob</hi> been accuſtomed to pray, hee could not have ſollicited the Lord after this manner, in this extremity.</p>
            <p>Againe, in the end of the ſame Chapter, when Chriſt appeared unto him in an humane likeneſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. He wraſtled with him all night for a bleſſing, and would not give over till he had a promiſe from him; though he went limping away, the Angel giving him ſuch a cruſh on the hollow of his thigh in wraſtling, as made him draw his legs after him, by the diſlocation, or diſ-joynting of his hip bone; it may ſeeme it was through the ſhrinking of the ſinew which had that bone in the ſocket.</p>
            <p>Ah, it is an excellent thing, as it were to wraſtle with God, and though hee ſeeme angry with us, and ready to lame us and maime us, as yet ſtill to minde our ſelves of his promiſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue fervent and conſtant in prayers, till at laſt hee pleaſe to anſwer us and make us know that wee ſhall prevaile with him. If <hi>Iacob</hi> had not been a devout man, well skilled in calling upon Gods name, hee could never have maintained in his heart ſuch an invincible reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution as this, <hi>I will not let thee goe till thou bleſſe me,</hi> even then, when inſtead of bleſſing he had ſuch a wrench as might ſeeme rather to teſtifie anger againſt his importunity, then any minde to yeeld unto it.</p>
            <p>Again, when he was to ſend <hi>Benjamin</hi> unto Aegypt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.14. He followed him with his prayers, ſaying, <hi>God Almighty grant you favour before the Man, that he may ſend away your brother, and Benjamin.</hi> You muſt not thinke that hee contented himſelfe with this ſhort ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but he made his requeſt to God for this great thing in more words and oftner.</p>
            <p>So you ſee <hi>Iacob</hi> was a prayerfull man; this is one part of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>O that wee could bee prayerfull? O that wee could alſo make Gods name our refuge at all times? which they that doe not, can hardly take any true comfort in their eſtate, nor account themſelves true Iſraelites; and thoſe that doe, ſhew themſelves to bee guided with the ſame Spirit that <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Eſpecially let us learne to wraſtle with God, reſolving to continue earneſt and importunate, and to take no nay in begging for the performance of his promiſes, and for his bleſſing, though we ſeeme to gaine nothing, but that the Lord carries a ſhew of being angry with us, at length wee ſhall prevaile if wee continue fervent, and refuſe to give over, as our Lord alſo teacheth by his Parables in the Goſpell, of a childe, a friend, and the poore Widdow towards the unjuſt Iudge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:27208:173"/>Againe, you ſhall ſee <hi>Iacob</hi> vowing a vow to God, Chap. 28.20,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> vowed a vow to God.</note> 21. verſes, the ſumme of which is this, that if God would provide him neceſſaries, and preſerve him ſafely in his returne home to his Fathers, he would 1. make God his God, by adhering to him, and worſhipping him alone, and not imbracing any falſe God, whereof the world was every where full in thoſe dayes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Pillar ſhould bee Gods houſe; that is, a place of publike worſhipping God, where hee would openly and ſolemnly ſerve him, with prayers, ſacrifices, and all fit ſervices.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, that he would give his tenth to God, of all that God ſhould give him. Loe, you muſt learne the uſe of a vow, which is required in the Pſalme, <hi>Vow and pay to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A vow is a binding ones ſelfe in an oath to God,<note place="margin">What a vow is</note> to doe ſome law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing which is in his power, that he may the better attaine to his ſuits. And the uſe of it is, in afflictions to confirme our faith for the attaining of Gods help, or in proſperity to teſtifie our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for a benefit. Let us be cautelous what we vow, and let us as need and occaſion ſhall offer, make vowes to God, eſpecially the uſe of a vow may be to tie our ſelves from things otherwiſe lawfull, that have been occaſions of ſins to us; or to quicken us to ſuch good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as we finde our ſelves moſt ſlack in: only take heed of vowing raſhly, and vowing perpetually any thing, but what we be bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by duty: for it is not unfit to binde our ſelves to needfull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded things by a vow, as here <hi>Iacob</hi> voweth that God ſhall bee his God.</p>
            <p>I ſay therefore, uſe vowes as juſt occaſion ſhall ſerve, but not haſtily, nor in paſſion, for ſuch vowes likely prove miſchievous. And eſpecially be carefull to doe the things vowed, that is, to make God your God, ſticking cloſe to him, and abhorring all forreine gods. And ſeeing now the danger is not ſo great, a running after heatheniſh falſe gods, beware of going after thoſe heart-Idols, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, profit, credit, eaſe. Make not the belly your God, by loving riches, wealth, good fare, &amp;c. more than God, and caring for theſe things more than for the favour and honour of God.</p>
            <p>Theſe bee the moſt dangerous Idols of our times, many a man that abhorres to worſhip an Image, a Saint, an Angel, doth yet worſhip Mammon, and make the world his God; take heed of this Idolatry, labour to know, love, feare, truſt in, obey God, to remember him, to chooſe him, &amp;c. to give him that whole, and inward ſpirituall, moſt needfull, moſt acceptable worſhip of the heart, which ſhall not ceaſe to be worſhip even in heaven.</p>
            <p>The other Commandements continue in force during this life, of praying, reading, hearing, Sacraments, no uſe in heaven of oath, vowes, and ſuch a manner of ſanctifying Gods name as now, in heaven there is no uſe. So in the reſt:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:27208:174"/>But to know, love, feare, delight in, obey, there is alwayes uſe, and make God your God in this manner.</p>
            <p>Againe, prepare God an houſe, let him have a place of publique ſervice and worſhip. That you have provided to your hands: I need but requeſt to keep it in handſome and decent faſhion, to maintaine it comelily as beſeemeth Gods houſe, not as if it were a barne or ſome out-houſe.</p>
            <p>Former times you ſee built goodly and faire houſes for God: will not you keep them fairely, &amp; ſo, that they ſhall be ſweet, and dry, and ſightly, not in ſuch plight that would bring the imputation of baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon your ſelves, if any of your houſes ſhould lie ſo? Can you be at coſt to adorne and furniſh your owne houſes, and not Gods? For aſſure your ſelves, theſe places ſeparated for religious meetings be Gods houſes ſacred to him, dedicated, aſſigned, given to him, hee hath intereſt into them. If an Idols-Temple be an Idols-Temple; that is, ſuch an houſe as an Idoll hath intereſt in, and is ſacred with a falſe and unholy kinde of ſacredneſſe; ſure then a Church to God is Gods Church, and ſuch a thing as he is intereſſed into, and is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred with a true and reall ſacredneſſe: <hi>Mine houſe ſhall be called an houſe of prayer to all nations.</hi> Loe, an houſe of prayer, that is, of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique worſhip (a part for the whole) and this houſe Gods houſe, and that among all Nations. Would you wiſh a clearer proofe for the warrant of Churches and their ſacredneſſe? but what availes it to keep a Church handſome if you frequent it not? O therefore come to Gods houſe, frequent the publique worſhip there performed. The meaneſt ſervice done amongſt us, if it be but reading of a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is more noble (becauſe not ſo typicall) than the killing of a beaſt: Come therefore to Gods houſe conſtantly; ſure <hi>Iacob</hi> did not meane that he would ſet apart a place for publique worſhip and not come neare it, but that his care ſhould be there to worſhip God.</p>

            <p>But <hi>Iacob</hi> vowes to give the tenth of all that God ſhould give him, to God, even to the maintaining his publike worſhip in that place, for Gods worſhip will bee coſtly. Himſelfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally can receive nothing, but by giving it to his worſhip, and the places, and things, and perſons that belong to his worſhip, it is given to him. If there be any amongſt you, that thinkes exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of holy writ to binde him, as it ſeemes ſome doe in other things, where the matter is ſuch as will put them to no great coſt, let them aske their conſciences, Why ſhould not this example binde them as well as any other example? That it ſhould bee a typicall, ceremoniall, and temporall ordinance, to give God tithe of all wee have; I could never yet heare any reaſon of any force:

Some doe ſtraine their wits to finde out a kinde of ſhadow in it, and tell what it may ſignifie; but the Scripture, for ought I know, doth not give any notice of any ſuch thing. You ſee it was the uſe afore the Leviticall prieſthood, and therefore it is not a thing depending upon the Leviticall prieſthood: Nay, the Apoſtle makes mention, of it as a thing due to the eternall prieſthood of <hi>Melchiſedek.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould any man thinke his conſcience bound by any other Example, and not by this? But to me it ſeemes plaine, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> would never have obſerved this portion in meaſuring out theſe paiments to God, if they had not conceived it a perpetuall and a naturall duty. It is ſurely a morall precept to honour God with our goods, and by bringing preſents to him. Seeing theſe holy men thought it fit to grant God ſo liberall a portion, why ſhould we not thinke him worthy as much? But if you cannot bring your ſelves to thinke that ſo much is due to God; yet I hope you will make your ſelves beleeve, that ſurely ſomething muſt bee due to God, and that in a liberall quantity. For God is worthy to bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with our goods, I trow, as much now as ever: and doe we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him if we bring him no preſent, no gift? will you therefore be ſomewhat liberall to God? will you binde your ſelves by vow? or without vow freely dedicate ſome good part of your ſubſtance to God, and as God bleſſeth you, lay ſtill aſide ſomething (if you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt God ſo much, as you thinke he will not reward ſuch a quantity as the Tenth, why then with a ninth, or an eighth, or a ſeventh, or a fifth, with ſomething I ſay, that ſhall ſhew, you are deſirous to obey every Commandement, and ſo to prove your ſelves ſincere to God. Surely to marke how God proſpers a mans labour, and then to bee conſtant in laying aſide a good portion for God; this ſhall be none of mine, it ſhall be Gods, ready at hand for pious uſes, to keep up, and beautifie Gods houſe, to further Gods worſhip any way, and to relieve the poore members of Chriſt, would make you ſo rich in good workes, and ſo increaſe your liberality by exerciſe, as would undoubtedly pull a rich bleſſing upon you, and cauſe you to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt into the bleſſing of having your prayers to runne over with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
            <p>Shew your ſelves liberall to God, and be good <hi>Iacobs;</hi> elſe, he that is a niggard to God, and will honour him indeed with his lips, not with his goods, gives others reaſon to thinke, though himſelfe be ſo full of ſelf-love, that he will not think ſo of himſelfe that he honours him only with his lips.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, his ſtate is ſo poore that he cannot. I anſwer.</p>
            <p>God hath propounded this as a meanes to get riches; and the poore man hath no reaſon to thinke that Gods meanes will bee una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileable.</p>

If we ſee a man not to honour God with his wit and ſtrength, and then God deprive him of wit and ſtrength; Doe we not readily impute this croſſe to the deſert of that ſin? and why are we not induced to conclude, God doth not proſper this man in his eſtate, becauſe he did not honour God with his eſtate?

            <p>He was an humble man, as appeareth in his prayer to God before, when he confeſſeth, that he is <hi>Leſſe than the leaſt of all his mercies:</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he is unworthy the ſmalleſt of them, and had not deſerved even the meaneſt.</p>
            <p>It is a worthy grace to ſee ones owne unworthineſſe of any good thing, and to be ſo meane in his owne conceit, that hee challengeth nothing of deſert.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27208:176"/>
they ought to be poſſeſſed with the ſence of this diſtance betwixt God and them, ſo as to eſteeme themſelves nothing in compariſon of him, and as <hi>Iacob</hi> here expreſſeth it; than which, wee cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a better expreſſion, <hi>Leſſe than the leaſt of all his mercies.</hi> This hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility will make one thankfull for mercies, and carefull to uſe them well, and able meekly to part with them, and ſo fit to enjoy them. This humility pleaſeth God exceedingly, becauſe it fitteth the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for that end, to which God did principally looke in creating him, even to glorifie his Creatour. See that you get it, and increaſe it continually; harbour lowly thoughts of your ſelves, goe to God for good things, but goe, flying alone to the throne of grace and mercy, not at all truſting in your ſelves, or in any thing that is in your ſelves. The more one can diſavow his owne worth, and ſtill build his prayers, and hopes on Gods mercies, the more pleaſing to God are both himſelfe and his ſervices.</p>

               <note place="margin">2.

To have enough, and know when one hath enough, is better than all abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance that can be attained. Blame your ſelves, that a little will not give you content, but you are ſtill greedy of more, though you have already food and raiment in abundance.</p>
            <p>Follow S. <hi>Pauls</hi> precept, and <hi>Iacobs</hi> example; you muſt take pains often with you ſelves, to ſettle your hearts in this contentation, elſe it will not be gotten, for mans corrupt nature makes him unſatiable.

               <note place="margin">3. He was a diſcreet man.</note>Further, <hi>Iacob</hi> was a prudent, diſcreet man, and knew how to carry himſelfe fitly for the avoiding of danger, as may be ſeene in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> when he came againſt him full of wrath and fury, to revenge himſelfe for his ſuppoſed wrong, in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from him his birth-right, and his bleſſing.</p>
            <p>For firſt, he divided his family into two parts, ſaying, <hi>If Eſau come and ſmite the one company, the other ſhall eſcape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He prayed earneſtly to God to ſave him from the hands of his brother, whom he greatly feared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:27208:176"/>Thirdly, he preſenteth him with a large preſent, and ſet a ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt drove and drove, commanding them to anſwer his brother with all ſubmiſneſſe; ſaying when they ſhould be asked, <hi>Whoſe are theſe before thee? They be thy brother Iacobs.</hi> It is a preſent ſent to my Lord <hi>Eſau,</hi> and he is behinde us: and ſo the ſecond and the third, and all that followed the droves, ſaying, <hi>I will pacifie him with a gift that goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me,</hi> and afterwards, <hi>I will ſee his face, peradventure he will accept of me,</hi> and then having wraſtled with God, Chap. 32. he ſaw his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comming, and divided his children to <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> and the young maidens, and ſetting the hand maides firſt, then <hi>Leah,</hi> then <hi>Rachel,</hi> himſelf went before them, and fell on the ground ſeven times, and did obeiſance, and ſo cauſed the handmaids and his wives to do the like, and ſo by his ſubmiſſive carriage he pacified his brothers anger, and God working with his prudence, found him exceeding kinde and loving: and when he would have gone before him, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe by the pace of the young Infants and cattell, he avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his company, and by preſſing cauſed him to receive the gift, and in very modeſt manner refuſed the traine which his brother left with him, and eſcaped his hands. So he proved that to be true, which after <hi>Solomon</hi> told, <hi>That a gift in the boſome pacifieth great wrath,</hi> Prov. 21.14. <hi>And a gift is as a precious ſtone in the eyes of him that hath it, and it proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whetherſoever it goeth,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.4. <hi>Yeelding pacifieth great offences.</hi> Thus <hi>Iacob</hi> carried himſelfe prudently, and eſcaped his brothers fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Let us learne of <hi>Iacob,</hi> by liberality and ſubmiſſiveneſſe to appeaſe the fury of unreaſonable men: We muſt not yeeld ſo far as to ſin, but to yeeld in all meek and lowly geſtures even to worthy men, is not a ſin but a vertue. So likewiſe Bribery is naught, that is, to ſeek to turne a Governour from juſtice by gifts, and hire him to do wrong; but by gifts to pacifie an angry man, and hire him to forbeare ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that is a lawfull uſe of gifts, and to practiſe liberality in ſo due a ſeaſon, to redeeme the life by the goods, and to make them quiet that were inraged, is a very good thing.</p>
            <p>Seaſonable ſtooping, and ſeaſonable bounty be fruits of prudence, and by ſuch meanes to ſave our ſelves from danger, is a part of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diſcretion. The like prudence <hi>Iacob</hi> practiſed towards the Aegyptian Lord whom he thought to be offended, not knowing that it was his ſon <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> for when they were to have <hi>Benjamin</hi> in before him, he wiſhed them to take a preſent with them, and double money in their hands, that they might prevent all occaſion of diſtaſte, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the money that was in his ſackes mouth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.11, 12.</p>
            <p>We muſt pray to God to give us the likewiſe diſcretion, that we may carefully uſe all fit meanes to aſſwage wrath, and ſo by Gods bleſſing upon our diſcreet care, may free our ſelves from evill. But ſtubbornneſſe, and niggardlineſſe, and a kinde of fowre ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our right or innocency, that it may carry a ſhew of courage and reſolution, is yet indeed a fruit of folly and ſelf-conceit.</p>

            <p>The world is full of examples, by which it is manifeſt, that many come together in great heate of love, and within a few yeares grow
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:27208:178"/>
ſo froward, diſcontented, and careleſſe either of other, as none can be more. And againe, others come together with diſcretion, not in ſuch vehemency of Love, and their hearts afterwards doe cleave each to other in ſingular love and deerneſſe. Therefore it would become a childe to croſſe his affection, rather than his Parents.</p>
            <p>But what if Parents will force their Children either not at all to marry, or elſe to marry with ſuch as are unfit for them, in regard of Age, Religion, and in reſpect of evident deformities of Body, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of Life.</p>
            <p>I anſwer:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Parents are bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide fit yoake-fellowes for their children.</note>I know no ſuch unlimited authoritie granted to Parents, as to compell their children upon inconveniences in any of theſe reſpects. Parents are bound to tender fit yoake-fellowes to their Children, as God did to <hi>Adam:</hi> elſe the Children in not following their advice do forbeare to be ruled, not by their authority, but by their luſts. For if Parents may not <hi>provoke their Children to wrath, leſt they be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> ſurely they may not thruſt them upon other miſeries and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</p>
            <p>But what muſt be done in ſuch a caſe? I anſwer:</p>
            <p>By patience and long ſuffering, and intreaty of common friends, and like meanes, the Children muſt ſeeke to win their Parents to reaſon; which if they cannot doe, they muſt referre themſelves to the Governours, Magiſtrates, or Miniſters: and if theſe will not, or by the Lawes cannot provide for their help, they muſt even follow the advice of vertuous and wiſe Friends and Neighbors.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that in ſuch caſe the Parents frowardneſſe be ſuch that they will not yeeld to reaſon, and that they will rather drive their Children to an inconvenient match, or yeeld their good liking to none, what muſt the childe doe then?</p>
            <p>I anſwer:</p>
            <p>If God vouchſafe that gift he muſt forbeare Marriage, eſteeming himſelfe called of God to the ſingle life: But if hee cannot by all good wayes ſo farre overcome himſelfe, but that his minde is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by deſires of Marriage, hee hath a plaine rule from S. <hi>Paul: It is better to marry than to burne.</hi> Yea, but then the Parents diſpleaſure followes, and loſſe of ſuch meanes or portion as elſe he might have had.</p>
            <p>I anſwer:</p>
            <p>Every good Chriſtian muſt reſolve to take up his croſſe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt; therefore I require you ſonnes that have not troden in <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſteps for this matter, to be humbled for it with true and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty repentance. Sinne will hazard a good man to ſome ſeverity of puniſhment (I meane that of knowne ſinnes, ſuch as a man doth, or would bee carefull might underſtand to bee ſinnes) untill par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular repentance come betwixt, to ſtop or remove that ſame; but when a man hath and doth conveniently at fit times humble himſelfe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:27208:178"/>
for a fault, it ceaſeth to make him liable to temporall evils, further then they be needfull to increaſe and make up what would be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his repentance, and he that will at Gods reproofe turne unto him in humiliation and amendment, ſhall finde the Lord a gracious Father, and ſuch a one as will not proceed to ſmarting corrections, if loving and earneſt admonitions may prevaile.</p>
            <p>Againe, all you children to whom God hath vouchſafed ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as have dealt wiſely and mildly with you in this matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting unto you fit yokefellows, and ſuch againſt whom no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be juſtly made, or have yeelded you to your owne choice, and that hath ſo guided you too, that you have pleaſed your Parents in your matches, and ſo with good will and approbation on both ſides have entred into this eſtate, be you thankfull to God that hath ordered this affaire ſo properouſly for you, and take heed of aſcribing this comfort to your owne wit and goodneſſe, without giving the whole honour to God, that gave the wit, and the goodneſſe, and the ſucceſſe, without whoſe favourable providence, neither wit, nor goodneſſe would have brought the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>If benefits be perverted to nouriſh our good conceits of our ſelves, not to encreaſe our thankes and praiſes to God, they be but unſanctified benefits, ſuch as at laſt will make our ſtate more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than the want of them would have done.</p>
            <p>But all you young, and yet unmarried folke, looke to your ſelves, pray to God to ſubdue your paſſions to reaſon, and both to your Parents; take notice it is your duty to give this honour to your Parents, and reſolve that by Gods aſſiſtance you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it.</p>
            <p>Hearken to no enticements, let no beauty or other allurement winne ground upon your hearts, but ſtill keepe your ſelves free and in fit caſe to continue dutifull obſervers of the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
            <p>But we have another Superiour with whom <hi>Iacob</hi> had occaſion at laſt to deale, <hi>viz. Laban.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective to his Vncle <hi>Laban.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, An Vncle.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A Maſter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A Father in Law.</p>
            <p>See how well <hi>Iacob</hi> carried himſelfe to <hi>Laban</hi> in all theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As he was an Vncle, before he entred into the other relations, he lived ſo lovingly and painfully with him in his houſe for the ſpace of a moneth together, that <hi>Labans</hi> ſelfe was both willing to give him ſome due wages and allowance for his ſervice, which of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord he offered himſelfe to doe, and alſo when motion was made of giving him <hi>Rachel,</hi> did willingly accept the motion, yea put the other upon him too againſt his will, whereby it is evident, that he behaved not himſelfe ſo, as to be a cumber and burden to the family, but was helpfull to it: This was very commendable in him, that he carried
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:27208:179"/>
himſelfe temperately, and vertuouſly, and profitably in his Vncles houſe, where he came to ſojourne for a time.</p>
            <p>O that all thoſe, whoſe occaſions invite them to viſit their kindred and to abide ſome time with them, would ſhew themſelves ſo vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and wiſe, and orderly in their whole behaviour, that their friends might not have occaſion to account them burdens, but rather bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits unto themſelves and their families, ſo long as they ſhall have cauſe to continue, and not ſo rudely, waſtfully, idly, that the houſe is diſcharged as it were of ſome ill humour, when the time comes that they ſhall be gone away.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. He craved his good will to marry his daughter.</note>Further, <hi>Laban</hi> had two daughters, and <hi>Iacob</hi> loved one intirely, yet we ſee that he craved the Fathers good will afore he made any ſuit at all to the maiden. He went not to <hi>Rachel</hi> to get her good will, and to win a promiſe from her, but takes the fitteſt occaſion that offered it ſelfe, to let the Father underſtand his minde, and to make agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him. Here alſo young men have an excellent patterne to imitate, and a ſweet direction for their proceedings in marriage; Firſt, to make ſure with the Parents and Governours, and after to deale with the young perſons themſelves, as alſo <hi>Sampſon</hi> did, and the ſervant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as nature it ſelfe teacheth it ſhould be done; for why ſhould not he that hath right into any thing, bee conſulted withall about parting with it, afore we ſeek to drive away the thing it ſelfe which appertaineth to him.</p>
            <p>O thoſe of you that have done, or are now in doing otherwiſe, bee you blamed as men that proceed not vertuouſly in this courſe, and therefore are either through lucre of portion, or elſe inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (which men call love) thruſt aſide from a right, to a wrong path. Now at laſt <hi>Iacob</hi> becomes a ſervant to his Father in Law, and agrees to performe ſeven yeares ſervice for one daughter, and as many for the other.</p>
            <p>For my part I cannot commend <hi>Iacobs</hi> prudence in this matter, he bound himſelf to a very long apprentiſhip. He might have taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to have ſent meſſengers betwixt <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Laban,</hi> that his portion might have procured this match rather than his ſervice. But herein yet he deales well with <hi>Laban,</hi> whom he was willing to advantage ſo much for his daughters ſake. So far was he from being deſirous to ſteale away <hi>Rachel,</hi> that he choſe rather to ſue for her: every young man muſt learne hence not that particular thing which <hi>Iacob</hi> did, to ſerve for a wife, but that common rule of equity which he followed, to give a man all reaſonable and good content in marrying his daughter, in affording ſuch convenient allowance to her as is fit, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he be unwilling to this duty; that is, not moved more with baſe ends, than love of her whom he marrieth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. Tooke pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently the wrong that he offered him.</note>But <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhewes a ſingular gentleneſſe and reſpect to him in that, when he had beguiled him, and put <hi>Leah</hi> upon him inſtead of <hi>Rachel,</hi> yet he did not put her away, and refuſe to have her, but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:27208:179"/>
was rather contented to ſerve another ſeven yeres for <hi>Rachael,</hi> than he would make any ſtir. As for the matter of Polygamy and marrying two ſiſters, the laſt was not then a ſin, the former was not eſteemed to be one; but ſurely <hi>Iacob</hi> received very hard meaſure of <hi>Laban</hi> in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding another upon him, than was agreed upon to be his wife; yet you ſee hee devoures the injurie without any great outcry, onely hee tels him of the wrong in words, nothing ſavouring of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe.</p>
            <p>O that wee alſo could learne to reprove a wrong-doer, ſpecially a ſuperiour doing us wrong, with milde and good language, without railing, without clamorouſneſſe and diſgracefull ſpeeches. It were a ſweet thing to have ſo much government over our paſſions and tongues, that they might not carry us to ſet out wrongs with too many and large aggravations, and with invective and contumelious ſpeeches againſt him that hath done us the wrong. It is never tryed to the purpoſe what humility, what true diſcretion the ſoule is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed withall, untill it receive the triall of injuries. He that in ſuch caſe can keepe himſelfe within compaſſe, that his words be neither many nor violent, ſhewes that he hath ſome command of himſelfe, and ſome feeling acknowledgement of Gods provident government, and his own worthineſſe of far greater evils.</p>
            <p>But he that hath never done amplifying ſuch a wrong, and is fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and bitter againſt the offendor, ſhewes that hee hath a great heart that can make the wrong ſo great, and doth not looke to the hand, but to the rod, againſt which hee gives himſelfe to ſhew ſo much diſtemper.</p>
            <p>Againe you ſee, that <hi>Iacob</hi> is even ready patiently to ſit downe by the wrong, and is content now to make himſelfe an Apprentice for another ſeven yeares, rather than he will make a great ſtir, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with <hi>Laban.</hi> We cannot thinke ſo hardly of any times, that there were no Lawes or Governours that would and ſhould have righted this wrong, if <hi>Iacob</hi> would have made his complaints: but <hi>Iacob</hi> was from his Fathers houſe, and a ſtranger, and friendleſſe, and therefore thought it more wiſdome to ſit downe and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſomewhat hard conditions, than to make a greater quarrell and contention.</p>
            <p>O that we could get our hearts ſtored with a proportion of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and meekneſſe, ſutable to that of <hi>Iacob,</hi> even to make us able to devoure wrongs with ſomewhat ill and harſh conſequences, rather than to make a great brawle, ſpecially if we be inferiours alſo, and finde our ſelves likely to mend our ſelves little by contending, ſuch a ſubmiſſive and peaceable diſpoſition will make us capable of a larger bleſſing from God than any wee could get by ſtriving and brawling; and not onely ſo, but would give us more quietneſſe and content in our ſelves, than the either revenging or redreſſing of a wrong another way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:27208:180"/>Follow <hi>Iacob</hi> therefore in this his carriage towards his Father in Law.</p>
            <p>And now we finde <hi>Iacob</hi> a ſervant, and that for fourteen yeares: hee married the two daughters within a few moneths after his comming thither, as may be demonſtrated by the ages of the children, by name of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the youngeſt, who was ſeventeene when hee was ſold into Aegypt, and thirty when he ſtood before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> firſt, and lived after, ſeven yeares of plenty, and then two yeares of ſcarcity; that is, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine in all, and then was <hi>Iacob</hi> one hundred and thirty. So that <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was ninty and one yeares of age when he begate him, and that was in the laſt of the fourteene yeares agreed upon, for by and by upon his birth, <hi>Iacob</hi> would have laboured for his owne houſe, and <hi>Laban</hi> agrees upon wages. Therefore hee was ſeventy and ſeven yeares or thereabouts, when he came to <hi>Laban,</hi> and being of that age, it was not likely that he would live ſo long unmarried afore hee tooke a wife.</p>
            <p>Againe, betwixt <hi>Iacobs</hi> going to <hi>Padan,</hi> and returning, were but two yeares at the moſt, and then was <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſeven yeares old, for hee was borne toward the end of the fourteenth yeare; and if <hi>Iacob</hi> had not married <hi>Leah</hi> till ſeven yeares were ended, the eldeſt of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes could be but ſeven yeares at moſt elder than hee; that is, fourteene yeares, and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was thirty and nine yeares when <hi>Iacob</hi> came to him, or thereabouts; Therefore, the eldeſt of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes at that time was but forty and ſix, and <hi>Iudah</hi> was the fourth of the ſame mother; ſo he muſt be but forty and two, or thereabouts, and yet had he three ſonnes marriageable before he begate <hi>Pharez,</hi> and <hi>Pharez</hi> had two ſonnes when they went downe to Aegypt. Allow <hi>Iudah</hi> to marry at fifteene, <hi>Er</hi> at fifteene, and let <hi>Thamar</hi> waite but two yeares for the third ſonne, now <hi>Iudah</hi> was thirty and two: Let <hi>Pharez</hi> marry at fifteene, and have two ſonnes in two yeares, that is ſeventeene, ſo have we forty and nine yeares: and therefore ſeeing greater haſte could not be made, at leaſt ſo many yeares did paſſe betwixt, and that will come to juſt ſeven yeares more than the time will amount too, if <hi>Iacob</hi> married at the end of ſeven yeares; therefore he married the firſt yeare.</p>
            <p>But whenſoever he married, in making himſelfe a ſon in Law, he made himſelfe an hired ſervant too; now how did he carry himſelfe as a ſervant.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. He was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and faithfull in his ſervice to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.</hi>
               </note>Firſt, with all diligence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, faithfulneſſe.</p>
            <p>For he followed his maſters buſineſſe painfully, and conſtantly, and ordered himſelfe towards them moſt innocently, and ſo made his little, much, through the bleſſing of God upon his labour and fidelity.</p>
            <p>Now theſe duties appertaine to all ſervants, and are required of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, doing <hi>Service with good will, and not with eye ſervice,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:27208:180"/>
as men pleaſers, but with ſingleneſſe of heart, fearing God, and ſhewing all good faithfulneſſe, that the name of God be not evill ſpoken of.</hi> And ſeeing God would have families maintained, and a diſtinction of Maſter, and Servants in the families, it was requiſite that he ſhould oblige ſervants to theſe duties, for upon the proſperity of families depends the welfare of Townes and Countries, and ſo of the whole World.</p>
            <p>An houſe in which good ſervants live, proſpers; but idle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſty ſervants quickly bring it to nought; God therefore that made all things for good, welfare, and proſperity, muſt needs, according to the rules of his own wiſdome, fit the means to the end, and require ſervants in this manner to governe themſelves to their Governours.</p>
            <p>Now you that have been ſervants formerly, which hath beene the ſtate and condition of the greater number amongſt you; Conſider what ſervants you have been, let not your younger dayes be paſſed over forgetfully.</p>
            <p>It is a principall part of an aged mans duty to looke backe upon his former times, and to finde out the miſtakes of his youth, that by humbling himſelfe for them, he may attaine pardon from God.</p>
            <p>Loe this duty now, and if you can remember your ſelves to have been ſlothfull, waſtfull, undutifull ſervants, as far unlike to <hi>Iacob,</hi> as blacke and white are unlike each to other; then take time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent your ſelves before God, and judging your ſelves for ſuch inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſſe, beg pardon and remiſſion, and reſolve againſt the like corruptions of your preſent places.</p>
            <p>And you who finde that God did inable you in that eſtate to ſhew your ſelves diligent and truſty, give God the glory, and rejoyce in his great goodneſſe, that gave you not over to the unbridledneſſe of your evill natures.</p>
            <p>An aged man, whoſe youth hath been indifferently well ordered, hath great cauſe to bleſſe Gods name that gave him not over to the licentiouſneſſe of that age. And all you that be ſervants, muſt pray to God that he would make you good and conſcionable ſervants, that not alone out of love to your owne reputation, and a deſire to thrive in the world, that you may be painfull and truſty, but out of a deſire and intention to pleaſe God in your places and callings; for S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have ſervants to remember, that <hi>They ſerve the Lord Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>To looke unto the immortall inheritance,</hi> with which he will reward them, as well as thoſe that ſerve him in higher callings.</p>
            <p>Again, He diſcovered a great deale of patience,<note place="margin">6. He was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to <hi>Laban,</hi> though hee changed his wages.</note> and gentleneſſe towards him, for <hi>Laban</hi> was fickle and inconſtant, and changed his wages many times, he ſaith ten times I ſuppoſe, uſing by a wonted fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, a certaine number for an uncertaine. But <hi>Iacob</hi> devoures this wrong patiently, doth not expoſtulate with him, nor ſhew himſelfe ſharp or bitter, but puts it over without words, and goes not from him through diſcontent, till God by an Angel bid him goe to his Fathers houſe againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:27208:181"/>So ſhould ſervants ſhew themſelves gentle to their ungentle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that are unkinde and injurious to them, and doe not uſe them ſo well as equity requireth, and not be clamorous and violent againſt them. But moſt ſervants, though they receive no hard meaſure, but alone are juſtly reproved and corrected for their faults, are ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient that they cannot beare it, but make falſe and harſh complaints, and are ſo imbittered and diſcontented, that they ſtraight reſolve to run away, and cannot bring themſelves to ſtoope: theſe are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſpirit to <hi>Iacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">7. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, when he parted from him, he ſhewed mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Paſſions.</note>Now laſtly, in the cloze of all, when <hi>Iacob</hi> went from his Father in Law, he ſhewed himſelfe a man, that though hee were ſenſible of injuries, could yet moderate his paſſions, and keep anger within due limits; for hee chid with him indeed, and was angry againſt him, which any man may lawfully doe againſt him that ſeekes to doe him hurt; but he doth not raile at him, nor give him foule language, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he telleth him before their common friends, of his former and evill uſage; acknowledging Gods goodneſſe in preſerving him from his rage.</p>
            <p>O that we could learne of him to be ſo farre maſters of our ſelves, that when juſt occaſion of anger doth offer it ſelfe, wee might then command our ſelves to forbeare bitter and reviling ſpeeches, and not be ſo tranſported beyond our ſelves, as to raile, ſweare, curſe, threaten, and it may be worſe than all this. Moſt men, when anger begins to boile, forget almoſt that they be men, altogether that they be Chriſtian men, and are ſo madded, that they care not what vile language proceeds out of their mouthes, and what ſharpneſſe of a razor they diſcover in their tongues; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erifying that of S. <hi>Iames, That the tongue is ſet on fire of hell,</hi> and it ſelfe ſets on fire the whole courſe of nature; and that though our Saviour have ſomanifeſtly adjudged to hell, him that doth raile at his brother with the name of Foole.</p>
            <p>See your folly and pride in this venting of diſtempered anger, and bewaile it, and now learne of Gods faithfull ſervant <hi>Iacob</hi> (ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Patriarch, that by him the whole Church is called <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi>) to be ſo angry, as not to ſin by being driven forth into bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of carriage.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">He was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pacified with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law.</note>But laſt of all, he was ſo quickly pacified, that when his Father did alone intimate (and not plainly make) a confeſſion of his fault, by requeſting a Covenant of peace betwixt them, quickly without any words he condeſcended, and makes a feaſt for <hi>Laban</hi> and the reſt, and confirmes the Covenant by an oath, as you may reade it in <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.45. to the end.</p>
            <p>Here is a man of a quiet ſpirit indeed! His Father in Law had wronged him formerly, and preſently, by purſuing him, and by charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to have ſtolne his Idols, which he fooliſhly calleth gods, yet he had ſo ſoon forgotten all this, as at the firſt word to imbrace an offer of reconciliation, and to enter into a Covenant with him of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:27208:181"/>
peaceable carriage to himſelfe and his daughters. It is a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellent grace to be quickly and eaſily pacified, and to blot out the remembrance of wrongs, and to carry himſelfe lovingly to ſuch a man as hath offered him hard meaſure, and that alſo many times, even as if he had received no ſuch injury from him.</p>
            <p>This is to imitate God and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who doth ſo forgive us, and a ſurer proofe of an humble and diſcreet ſpirit wee cannot have any other.</p>
            <p>O you that finde your ſelves of a bitter revengefull ſpirit, that if you have been wrongfully entreated know not how to forget it, know not how to forbeare taking all advantages of requiting like for like: See how contrary you be to this godly man, and entertaine even anger and deteſtation againſt your ſelves for ſuch maliciouſneſſe, and labour now ſo to preſſe upon your ſelves the Commandement of God, and example both of God and good men withall, beſeeching the Lord by his Spirit to worke the like gentleneſſe, long-ſuffering, and meekneſſe in you, that you alſo may bee eaſily pacified, and ſo ſoone able to quench the apprehenſion of injuries. Let us profit by good examples, and frame to the diſcharge of theſe duties, which the precept of God telleth us that we ought to doe, and the practiſe of godly men aſſureth us they may be done. If a thing be required, and poſſible, why ſhould we not addreſſe our ſelves unto it?</p>
            <p>So much of <hi>Iacobs</hi> vertuous behaviour to his Superiours:</p>

            <p>He uſeth all ſubmiſſive geſture and loving carriage to pacifie his anger, as we have ſhewed you before:<note place="margin">9 He uſeth all ſubmiſſive ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures ond lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carriage to pacifie his Brother <hi>Eſau's</hi> anger.</note> then we commended him for his prudence and diſcretion to ſave himſelfe; here we are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him for his exceeding ſubmiſſive and winning carriage to his brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iacob</hi> was not deſtitute of meanes to have hired as many ſouldiers as <hi>Eſau</hi> brought with him, or ſome meanes he might have be thought himſelfe of whereby to reſiſt him; but he chooſeth rather to ſtoope and pacifie him by the faireſt wayes he could. God commandeth his people to offer termes of peace before they beſieged a City.</p>
            <p>Surely, ſubmiſſive and melting carriage is the beſt way to pacifie wrath, and we muſt ſeek to that courſe firſt, not alone, when wee bee over marched with an enemy, but even then when we have power in our hands to ſave our ſelves by force, as wee ſee in <hi>Iephta</hi> towards the King of Ammon. But ſo ſturdy of nature be ſome, yea many, that they would rather expoſe themſelves to the rage of an <hi>Eſau,</hi> than have ſo bowed, they count it a baſeneſſe of minde to ſtoop and fall downe before another, having ſuch a blinde eye that they cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt humility and abjectnes. He that yeelds ſubmiſſive and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying words and geſtures, is humble: he that ſtoops ſo low as to pleaſe another, he is abaſed.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for <hi>Iacobs</hi> vertues to <hi>Eſau.</hi>

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:27208:182"/>Now towards his owne Family:</p>
            <p>Firſt, in generall conſidered, He is carefull to provide for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to pray for it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to purge it from ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">10 He is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to provide for his owne Family.</note>Firſt, to provide for it, for you ſhall ſee him returning this anſwer to his Father in Law after the end of his two apprentiſhips, <hi>When ſhall I provide for mine owne houſe,</hi> Gen. 30.30. When ſhall I doe or work alſo for mine owne houſe. <hi>Iacob</hi> had a rich Father in Law, <hi>Laban,</hi> and and a rich Father, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and yet will not he caſt himſelfe upon them to provide for his wife and children, but himſelfe will worke for that end: This is a thing required of all men by the light of nature, as well as by the Lawes of God, to make proviſion of things needfull for their families.</p>
            <p>All thoſe beaſts and birds which live by couples, and are not ſold over to promiſcuous generation, doe provide holes and neſts for their young, and joyne to maintaine them when they be young: See you not the poore Rookes now in the height of the trees preaching to you this duty with ſo loud croakings? that you can ſcarce paſſe by a Grove, but that inarticulate language will admoniſh you; how quiet be they all the Winter, and other ſeaſons? But when the Spring comes, and that now nature prompts them to procreate youngs they are ſo diligent to build neſts, and to hatch the young, and to feed them till they can ſhift for themſelves, that no houre ſees them idle, or ceaſing from that duty; you may ſee the ſame in the poore Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: Seeing they be here, I will commend them to you for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of this duty, early and late they be cloſe at this worke (taking indeed a little time morning and evening to ſit and chirp out their merry tune, as if they would teach you to take time for the praiſing of God, however urgent your buſineſſe may ſeeme to be) but elſe all day long, flying too and fro with food to put into the mouthes of their gaping young.</p>
            <p>Can you ſee theſe things and not be inſtructed to good husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry? S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls him worſe than an Infidell, that doth not labour for his family, to provide it neceſſaries. He might have gone a little further, and called him worſe than the feathered fowle, and the bruite beaſts; for even Foxes, Wolves, Beares, and Lions have this care in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in them by nature.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, you unnaturall, ſlothfull, waſtfull Fathers and Mothers that are ſo wickedly given over to idleneſſe, and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or gaming, or other looſneſſe, that you either will not worke at all, or elſe will not work for your Families, but your luſts to ſpend it on them. I pray you at length be aſhamed of ſuch worſe than bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh diſtemper of minde, and more than beaſt-like miſdemeanour; what account can you give to God when he ſhall call you to an account?</p>
            <p>Where was your naturall affection to your owne bodies and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:27208:182"/>
bowels? where was your dutifull obedience to the Law of God and Nature, and the Lawes of well ordered Common wealths? where were your wits and your conſciences? and where be they that you live more ſinfully and ſcandalouſly than the ignorant. Goe home I beſeech you with ſhame and ſorrow in your hearts and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, be not hardened againſt this reproofe, after ſo many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reproofes; but fall downe before God, condemning your ſelves to the pit of Hell for ſuch your unthriftineſſe, and confeſſing your owne extreme ſlavery to ſinne, and unfitneſſe to mend that or any other fault, beſeech the living God to reforme you by his Spirit, and to pardon you by the bloud of his Sonne, and even beleeve his promiſe that he will grant your prayers, and heale your Soules, and forgive your ſinnes for his Sonnes ſake; and ſo in Faith to his promiſes, and Obedience to his Commandements, ſet about the reformation of this and other faults; and ceaſe not praying, repenting, ſtriving, and you ſhall prevaile: unthriftineſſe will prove a diſeaſe of exceeding difficult care, but not uncurable: and you whom God hath pleaſed to make good and provident, and thrifty husbands, bleſſe him for it indeed; and withall pray him to order you ſo in labouring for your families, that it may ſhew it ſelfe to be a good Floure, growing up as a Fruit of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; not as a Weed ſpringing up from a corrupt, though reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Nature, by going into exceſſe, making you ſo eager in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for your houſes, as that you become niggardly unjuſt, or otherwiſe exceſſive. For the worldly minded man, though hee live in better reputation on Earth, hath no better reputation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven than the waſte-good: nor ſhall have leſſe torment in Hell, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the worldly minded are enemies to God, as well as the ſenſuall minded. So <hi>Iacob</hi> provided for his family.</p>
            <p>Now hee prayes for them,<note place="margin">11. Hee prayes for his family.</note> as you ſee hee did when <hi>Iſaac</hi> came againſt him; <hi>Save me, for I feare leſt he come and ſtrike the Mother with the Children.</hi> Parents muſt bleſſe their children; and in this ſence alſo the whole families, and cry to God for proſperity and peace. If the Apoſtles bee bidden to pronounce peace, ſurely then wee muſt pray for it. If S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for the houſhold of <hi>Oneſipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> were it not a wonder that <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> ſhould not pray for his owne houſhold? You Governours, ſhew your ſelves religious as well as thrifty: call upon God for the people committed to your charge: If publque ſupplications muſt be made for all men, ſurely then even man muſt privatly pray for them that are his owne. Be not prophane, content not your ſelves alone to labour and toyle for your families; but viſit the Throne of Grace in their behalfe, and call earneſtly upon God to ſave them chiefly from ſinne and wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>Iacob</hi> purged his family, as you have it, <hi>Gen</hi> 35.2.<note place="margin">12 He purged his family.</note> to the requiring them to put away the falſe gods, and to bee cleane,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:27208:183"/>
and change their garments, and then having received of them all their idolatrous and ſuperſtitious trinkets, hee buried them under the Oake mentioned there.</p>
            <p>O that all Parents would be carefull to clenſe all vices out of their houſes, as well as Idolatry, and this as well as other vices.</p>
            <p>But Parents are moſt times too too careleſſe of their families and ſee and winke at their ſinnes, their undecent behaviour, ryot, idleneſſe, diſguiſed attire, and any naughtineſſe that doth not bring forth great diſcredit in the World. Purifie your houſes, and ſo ſee the faults, as to chaſe them out, and call your people to amendment, to cleanneſſe, to changing their garments; if they be proud, vaine, fooliſh, as well as if they be ſuperſtitious.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">13. He inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; brought them to the Worſhip of God.</note>Laſtly, <hi>Iacob</hi> inſtructed his people here, and called them to the worſhip of the true God, telling them that he <hi>would goe to Bethel, and make an Altar to God that had fulfilled his vow, and met him when he fled from</hi> Eſau. Wee ſhould all call upon our families, and bring them to Gods Worſhip, and labour to inſtruct them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that they may be able to performe it holily and fruitfully: Surely, had not <hi>Iacob</hi> taught his people what Duty they did owe to God in theſe ſacrifices, and how to performe them in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner, he muſt have endeavoured onely to make them hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall abuſers of Gods ſervice.</p>
            <p>So much for <hi>Iacobs</hi> regard to his whole family.</p>
            <p>Now ſee how he ſhewed himſelfe in particular to his Wives and Ghildren.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">14. <hi>Jacob</hi> was a very kinde Husband to all his Wives.</note>To his Wives. Hee was undoubtedly a very kinde Husband to them all; for we read of no jarres or brawles.</p>
            <p>O that Husbands would live void of contention with their Wives! O that their houſes might be peaceable! It is a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of ruine, when an houſe is divided againſt it ſelfe. But ſpecially towards <hi>Rachael</hi> it is noted <hi>how hee loved her, Gen.</hi> 29.30. that is, very much more than the reſt. Indeed he had cauſe, ſhe was his true Wife for whom hee firſt agreed, <hi>Leah</hi> was forced upon him, he might lawfully have refuſed her; yea, and had not the cuſtome of the times tolerated poligamy, hee muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed her and taken <hi>Rachael,</hi> for whom hee made his agreement, and ſo in a ſort contracted himſelfe too.</p>
            <p>Now the light that hath ſhewed it ſelfe amongſt us, cauſeth that poligamy is baniſhed; therefore every one amongſt us is bound to love his Wife as <hi>Iacob</hi> did <hi>Rachael,</hi> which is alſo the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall commandement. Woe unto thoſe Husbands therefore that what ſhew of love ſoever they make unto their Wives at firſt; yet within a while are ſo ſowre and churliſh unto them, that they ſhew an extinguiſhment of love to have befallen them. So farre as any man faileth of loving his Wife, he muſt alſo faile of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God: It is poſſible to love the Wife and not God, but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:27208:183"/>
to love God and not the wife is impoſſible. Therefore now you huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſtrive to love your wives: and you Wives carry your ſelves ſo reſpectively and humbly, as to win love at your husbands hands. Nothing but this can make you live happily together; all riches, honours, pleaſures, be no farther ſoundly comfortable, than the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife are loving each to other.</p>
            <p>Now God can give love to them that aske, as well as wiſdome,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> was duly angry with his wife. Gen. 30.1, 2.</note> and let him that would love his wife, pray for it, and withall withdraw his heart from ſtrange women. But againe, <hi>Iacob</hi> could be duly angry with his wife, and reprove her for her fault, for when ſhe in a great rage cals to him for children, and would die if ſhe had none. He is angry at her, but with ſuch moderation, that he gives her a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, but no diſtempered language, ſaying, <hi>Am I in Gods ſtead, that hath withholden from thee the fruit of the wombe.</hi> As <hi>Iacob</hi> tempered his anger towards his Father in Law; ſo towards his wife, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moved with ſome paſſion, but it doth not carry him to any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or to inordinate ſharpneſſe. Here husbands muſt learne to follow this vertuous man, if there be juſt cauſe of being angry at the wife in regard of ſome great over-ſhooting her ſelfe towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others, they may be angry, but their anger muſt be ſo kept downe by love, that they may not be bitter, which the Apoſtle doth preciſely forbid to husbands; they muſt blame the fault, but not admixe words, to ſhew alienation of heart for the faults ſake.</p>
            <p>Two things husbands muſt looke to in reſpect of this anger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their wives:<note place="margin">Husbands muſt look to two things in reſpect of their anger to their wives.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, that it ariſe not but from ſome plaine and evident fault, ſuch as you ſee here in the Text; ſhe began to fall out with him for want of children, as if it had been his fault that ſhee conceived not as her ſiſter did.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that it produce not tartneſſe and reproachfull ſpeeches, and a conſtant ſowreneſſe, but alone a due and fit reproofe, as here alſo. Happy men that can ſo guide anger, and their tongues in anger.</p>
            <p>So hath <hi>Iacob</hi> done the office of a good houſholder in generall, and of a good husband. See now what a kinde Father he was, and what good he performed towards his children.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To all of them; then to ſome.<note place="margin">Gen. 46.34. &amp; Chap. 47.3</note>
            </p>
            <p>He did two things to them all;</p>
            <p>Firſt, he brought them up in a calling, to be Graſiers,<note place="margin">16. He brought up his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> as we call them, to breed Cattell, Sheep, Oxen, Camels, Goats, and the like, wherein himſelfe abounded.</p>
            <p>This he might the more eaſily doe,<note place="margin">Parents ſould bring up their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſome calling, and why.</note> becauſe himſelfe living in the quality of a ſervant to <hi>Laban</hi> his Father in Law, and having them borne to him in the time of his ſervice, he had fit opportunity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with that buſineſſe in which himſelfe was ſo totally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. Herein all good Parents are to imitate him, for the duty is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:27208:184"/>
neceſſary for the childrens ſake, and for the Common-wealth, and for the Parents owne ſake too.<note place="margin">Prov. 22.6.</note> 
               <hi>Traine up a childe in the way he ſhould goe;</hi> He doth not meane it alone, Catechize him in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and good converſation, but alſo in affaires of this world too, becauſe it is a part of his way to live in the world, as well as to know the things that belong to his ſoules health. Wee need not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture for that, for which nature it ſelfe is ſufficient; If God command men to walke orderly, and to eate the labour of their hands, their Parents muſt inure their children to ſuch a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſee that they obſerve that Commandement of God. If they muſt provide for them food and raiment for the preſent, much more the things that are needfull for their well-being for ever.</p>
            <p>Now a calling (an ability to doe ſome profitable thing by which they may maintaine themſelves with the publique advantage) is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their well-being in the whole courſe of their lives.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> But this duty is requiſite (as I ſaid) Firſt, for the Fathers owne ſake, who ſhall finde them ſo much more dutifull to himſelfe, by how much they have been trained up more painfully, and been more ſerviceable, and under command; even beaſts if they be much in hand, and have a kinde of acquaintance with the maſter, ſo that hee come neare to them, and accuſtome to doe ſomething about them, and to have them doe and ſuffer for him, are much more tame and gentle than thoſe that are never handled, never approached unto; So it muſt needs be alſo with men, they grow rude and barbarous if they be left to themſelves, but more affable and orderly when they are held in, and accuſtomed to walke by rule, as they be when they are trained up in a calling. Indeed ſome kinde of creatures are ſo fierce, that no uſe of handling will quite tame them; but even thoſe are far leſſe fierce than if they were never medled withall: So ſome children are very maſterfull, and diſobedient, even though they be ſet under government, and brought up in ſervice and labour, but how much more violent would they have proved if ſuch care had not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tempered them? It concernes the Parent to have his children ſubject and apt to be ruled; bringing them up in a calling condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth much this way, wherefore it is his part not to be wanting to his owne welfare and theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this is exceeding commodious to the Commonwealth, promoting the publique good very much: for far fewer perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate to ſcandalous courſes, and ſuch as trouble the peace of the Common-wealth of thoſe that have been brought up to take paines in ſome vocation, than of thoſe that have been looſly and idly brought up; and if any of thoſe that were accuſtomed to ſome vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doe degenerate, they are far more eaſily reclaimed, ſeeing the Magiſtrate hath ſome foundation to work upon. The perſon ſo edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated can doe ſomething if he will for his maintenance, ſo that here is a poſſibility of redreſſing his diſorders, finde him employment,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:27208:184"/>
and over-rule his will, and he is amended; But thoſe that have lived over looſly, and are not able to doe any thing, are almoſt deſperate the Magiſtrate knowes not which way to turne himſelfe to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of his reformation, but by uſing great extremities; for how ſhall he be compelled to doe any thing, that can doe nothing? and to make him learne ſome faculty when he is old, how extreamly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult is that? So now nothing remaineth but an houſe of Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Gallies, or the like, whereby to force men, which ſhould goe much againſt the hearts of Governours, if any other courſe may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Wherefore it concernes Parents as they love the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, not to deliver over into the Magiſtrates, ſuch croſſe and crooked pieces as cannot be made fit for any uſe without ſo much hewing.</p>
            <p>And for the benefit of the childes ſelfe, it helpeth much to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> comfortable living in reſpect of outward abundance, and not being burdenſome to others, and to his civill and orderly living in vertuous manner, and to his religious living when God ſhall call him to true piety; for if he be skilfull in ſome way of maintaining himſelfe, and will apply himſelfe to his calling, he ſhall finde the accompliſhment of Gods promiſes, <hi>He that tilleth his ground, ſhall be ſatisfied with bread,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 28.19. &amp; 22, 23.</note> and againe, <hi>In all labour there is abundance;</hi> but being deſtitute of this ability, how ſhall he but want, unleſſe a very great portion of goods or lands be given him? Yea, he that having lands and goods, hath not skill to imploy them, growes far ſooner waſtfull and unthrifty, and conſumeth his great eſtate, and then is put many times to baſe, many times to ſinfull ſhifts, which had he a good calling he might eſcape. Beſides, labour in a calling ſubdues vice, and he that hath a calling, may be painfull in it, he that hath none, cannot: Yea, if God call any perſon that hath been unprofitably brought up, to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelfe, ſuch a one ſhall be much more to ſeeke how to live religiouſly, than another that hath ſome imployment; for in not knowing what courſe to take, he is made to ſtand diſtracted, and doubtfull of his courſe, and ſo full of vexation and unquietneſſe. Now all you Parents, that have neglected your children very much, and ſuffered them to trifle out all that golden ſeaſon of youth, in which they ſhould have fitted themſelves for a profitable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life in elder dayes, be aſhamed; you have been ſo fooliſh, as not alone to tranſgreſſe the duty of Chriſtians, but even that which the heathens have done: You have been cauſes of your childrens miſery, and the Common-wealth too, and if it proceed not from ſome other cauſe then from wiſdome, your children muſt be but bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and diſeaſes to themſelves, and the world. Rich Parents are ſometimes guilty of this fault, for they thinke they ſhall leave them ſufficient to maintaine them though they doe nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intend them not to any vocation, not conſidering how ſoon the Lord can empty a full Veſſell, and make the River Iordan, yea, the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:27208:185"/>
red Sea dry as dry ground, and then what will become of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Yea, as not conſidering that to leave children much wealth, and not ſome ſufficiency for good imployment of themſelves, is to leave them furniſhed to doe themſelves hurt and others, and to bring all to nought quickly. But many of the poorer ranke are guilty of this fault too, who give themſelves ſo to unthriftineſſe, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beſtow ſo much as reading and writing on them, much leſſe ſome higher calling to which theſe ſhould fit them. If any mans unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventable poverty diſable him, we blame him not for that to which neceſſity compels him, only ſo that he pull not that neceſſity on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: but he that in a poore eſtate hath not ſome care to bring up his children to worke, and if he cannot effect it himſelfe, doth not herein ſeeke help of the publique and able perſons, is not ſo good a Parent as nature will teach him that he ſhould; therefore now I commend <hi>Iacobs</hi> patterne to your eyes, and pray you to cut out your lives according to his ſcantling: Be not wanting to your childrens welfare, the common proſperity, and your owne comfort. Let not others have cauſe to beſtow upon you the reproofe of <hi>Solomon. A childe left to himſelfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 29.15.</note> 
               <hi>maketh his Mother aſhamed;</hi> and what is hee but left to himſelfe and the devill, that is not acquainted with any profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table employment in a calling? And let me ſpeake ſomething to children in this behalfe: If Parents take never ſo due care, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will caſt off the yoake, what can the Parents doe? Therefore you muſt learne you ſelves to practiſe ſubjection to your Parents; as in all other things, ſo in this.</p>
            <p>Be carefull in the callings wherein your Parents have thought fit to place you, that you may get ability in them to doe good to your ſelves and others. The inconveniences that elſe will preſſe you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall prove more burden ſome unto your conſciences, when you ſhall be upbraided with theſe thoughts, ah, I might have done well but for mine owne wilfulneſſe, had I anſwered my Parents care and coſt, it would not have been thus evill with me.</p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.26.</note> 
               <hi>and his ſeed is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> There cannot be a better Counſellor than Gods Spirit; ſee the way of bleſſing your children, and you that have curſed your children, (as many a Father hath done both with bitter curſes in word, and alſo by walking in a way of curſedneſſe) abhorre your ſelves that have walked into a way quite contrary to that wherein <hi>Iacob</hi> did walk. The Lord hath appointed, that the <hi>Son which curſeth the Father ſhould die the death.</hi> Although the Parent owe not ſo much reſpect, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and gratitude to the childe as on the other ſide, yet ſure hee doth owe as much love (and this curſing contradicteth love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to love is to wiſh well, and to curſe, is to wiſh ill) therefore God will puniſh him ſeverely alſo, that curſeth his children: I doe not meane, him that in Gods name doth pronounce a curſe againſt them, but him that in his fury doth make ſome ill wiſh againſt them.</p>
            <p>O how unnaturall is that man, who doth worſe than ever it was heard that any bruit beaſt hath done yet! that is, in a rage tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his owne children in pieces. If it be a proofe of an unſanctified man, that <hi>His mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſſe;</hi> then ſure he is extreamely unſanctified, that curſeth his owne children; for that mouth is full of curſing to the very brim, that will daſh over againſt the fruit of ones owne body. But you that have not yet caſt off all, ſo much as likeneſſe to Chriſtianity, I pray you learne of ſo holy a man; Bleſſe your children in your kinde, as he did in his: live not in ſo wicked courſes, as may curſe your ſeed and root them out to deſtruction. If you deſire that God ſhould grant proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to your off-ſpring, walke in the wayes of his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
            <p>Intereſt your ſelves into his promiſes, by being upright and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and following every good way.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to let you ſee what <hi>Iacob</hi> did to ſome of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in particular.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> that had committed a great murder,<note place="margin">18. He repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> for their murder.

               <note place="margin">Gen. 49.7.</note> 
               <hi>for it was cruell:</hi> as in the former verſe he had ſaid, <hi>O my ſoule, come not thou into their ſecret;</hi> therefore alſo doth he diſinherite them, ſaying, <hi>I will divide them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:27208:186"/>They ſhall be but a poore and deſpiſed Tribe, and not inherite an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire portion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">And <hi>Reuben</hi> for his inceſt.</note>So likewiſe for <hi>Reuben,</hi> who had defiled his bed; we reade of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he ſaid to him before, yet on his deathbed he deprives and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherites him for it,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not excell;</hi> meaning, ſhall not have the double portion, and preheminence that belongeth to the firſt-borne, becauſe thou wenteſt up to thy Fathers bed. Doe you not thinke that it did put <hi>Simeon, Levi,</hi> and <hi>Reuben,</hi> the three eldeſt ſons unto ſorrow and ſhame? when they heard theſe words from their now dying Fathers mouth; you have been inceſtuouſly lewd <hi>Reuben,</hi> therefore you ſhall not be mine heire; and you <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were furiouſly revengefull, therefore neither ſhall the bleſſing bee yours.</p>
            <p>All Parents muſt learne to admoniſh and reprove their children for their faults, and to chaſtiſe them alſo, and ſhew their diſlike of their faults, though for ſome neceſſary circumſtances wee bee not bound to follow <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet for the matter of the duty wee muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him.</p>
            <p>If our children give themſelves to ſinfull courſes, wee muſt call them to us, chide them, ſhew our diſpleaſure againſt them, diminiſh the teſtimonies of our love, which elſe wee ſhould ſhew, and by that meanes helpe forward their repentance ſo much as may be.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially, when a man lies on his death-bed, hee ſhould not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get then to leave ſome ſuch words ſticking in his childrens mindes, as may cauſe them more ſeriouſly to bee humbled, that if they have not yet been duly ſorrowfull, they may then begin to be humbled at the conſideration of a Parents dying words; if they have, yet they may make their humiliation more deep and piercing.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">He greatly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and why.</note>But for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> he loved them both exceedingly more than any of their brethren: Partly, becauſe they were the ſons of his beſt beloved wife; partly becauſe they were his youngeſt children, dillings as we call them; and chiefly, becauſe they were the beſt of his children, at leaſt, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was, and for <hi>Benjamin</hi> he was the leaſt evill, if he did not ſhew any great vertue. What affection grew towards theſe, in thoſe two former reſpects, is but a thing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall. It is naturall to love the youngeſt, becauſe when they bee young, no expectation of more is left; and becauſe the elder being growne up, have not ſo much preſent occaſion of being ſtill in hand, and of receiving of thoſe kinde of teſtimonies of love, and becauſe the youngeſt being leaſt able to helpe themſelves, doe call the Parents heart more towards them. It is alſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to love the children of them very well, whoſe owne ſelves one hath ſo loved.</p>
            <p>If therefore one doe follow nature in theſe particulars, he is not to bee blamed. Onely this you muſt obſerve, that <hi>Iacobs</hi> love
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:27208:186"/>
to <hi>Rachels</hi> children made him not neglect <hi>Leahs</hi> quite, or be careleſſe of doing for them what became him to doe.</p>
            <p>Take heed you Parents that have had, or may have more wives ſucceſſively, though not together, that the preſent wife (who if her ill carriage hinder not, muſt needs be beſt beloved, becauſe ſhe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to receive love, and to requite it) I ſay, that the preſent wife make you not neglect or wrong the dead wives children; If it doe, God may croſſe you in the children of the living. God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly taken order for this caſe, and given this Commandement in the Law, <hi>If a man have two wives, one beloved, the other hated;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Deut. 21.15, 16, 17.</note> comparatively hated, leſſe loved, and children by them both; he ſhall not give the birth right from the ſonne of the leſſe loved, if he be firſt borne, to the ſonne of the more loved, but ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for the heire, which is ſo, though his mother finde leſſe favour in his eyes.</p>
            <p>It is a great fault, and ſhewes a man is led by paſſion, not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when he ſuffers his affections to be miſguided by ſuch reſpects, as in true judgement ſhould not over-rule them. But to love the childe the better for the mothers ſake, is no way unwarrantable, ſo that it be not with ſuch an exceſſive love as produceth injury or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect againſt the reſt: Only one thing common now amongſt us, I muſt not let paſſe without a kinde of wondring how it ſhould come to paſſe that many with us hate the Mother, yet dote of the childe, or hate the Father, yet be fond of the Son.</p>
            <p>Surely either the bad carriage of the Parent quencheth affection, or elſe to loath the roote, and love the fruit, is a thing no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to right reaſon.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Iacob</hi> is much to bee commended for that be loved <hi>Ioſeph</hi> moſt for his goodneſſe; Hee was his beſt ſonne, and hee amongſt all that were come to any growth, did ſhew forth the feare of God ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That ſhould rule the love of Parents to their children moſt of all, where they ſee moſt holineſſe and feare of God, there ſhould they beare moſt affection.</p>
            <p>For as any thing is moſt lovely, ſo with due reſervation of other reſpects, moſt love ſhould bee ſhewed: as if I have five children, all being children, and one having moſt grace, ſhould be moſt loved, becauſe grace makes moſt lovely, ſeeing it proves a man to bee loved of God, therefore muſt that childe be loved more than any of the reſt, and ſo in other like reſpects; The moſt gracious kinſman, the moſt gracious neighbour, the moſt gracious poore man.</p>
            <p>They therefore are even rotten in naughtineſſe, that love the moſt godly children leaſt, yea, that hate ſuch; and they are but weake in goodneſſe ſure, whoſe loves are drawne more by baſe attractives, than by grace.</p>
            <p>Surely, the liker we be to God in our love and hatred, the better we be, and the more unlike the worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:27208:187"/>Therefore <hi>Iacob</hi> gave the double portion of Land to <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſtock, which was one of the dignities attending the firſt borne; and the preheminence of government he gave to <hi>Iudah,</hi> becauſe he knew that Chriſt, the Ruler of the Church was to come of him, and ſo was led by due reaſon in both his bequeſts.</p>
            <p>And of <hi>Iacobs</hi> vertues to his Domeſticks you have heard: now how he is to ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">18. He curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſaluteth men of his own profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Gen. 29.4.</note>We have but two paſſages of his carriage that way, which come to my minde; Firſt, thoſe that he met withall at <hi>Padan Aram</hi> when he came thither; They were Shepheards, men of his owne profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he curteouſly ſaluteth them, and carrieth himſelfe with a kinde of familiarneſſe towards them, for he calleth them brethren, demands where they dwell, enquires of them about his Vncles wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and gives them husbandly counſell about their cattell: and ſo ſhould every man ſtand diſpoſed to men, as they be men, though dwelling many miles diſtant from him, he ſhould ſhew himſelfe amiable, meeke, loving, ready to ſalute them with good words, and titles, and to ſpeake lovingly to them, to give them good advice, and to doe any other good office, as occaſion may offer it ſelfe. We are commanded to <hi>Shew all meekneſſe to all men,</hi> and to <hi>Keepe peace with all men,</hi> and beſides brotherly love, <hi>To be charitable to all,</hi> and to account a ſtranger a neighbour, in loving him as our ſelves. For God hath made all mankinde of one blood, and knit them together in divers common bands. All be of one kinde, all of one Parent, matter, form, all redeemed with one blood, wherefore all muſt be loved, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt with.</p>
            <p>They therefore who are churliſh, ſowre, crabbed to ſtrangers, and can ſcarce ſpeake to them in any curteous accent, yea, that are apt if they meet with ſuch, to give them flouts and taunts, rather than any good words, and to offer them injury, rather than to help them with any good advice, are worthy to be called Swine, rather than Men. For even beaſts themſelves ſhew ſome reſpect unto them of the ſame kinde, more than thoſe of another, unleſſe it be ſome moſt fierce beaſts, and when occaſion of quarrell falleth out betwixt them.</p>
            <p>And let me now commend the vertue of humanity unto you, that is, of being ready to ſhew love to man, as he is man, and becauſe he is a man, one made after Gods owne image, and proceeding out of the ſame common roote. We all met in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes, and in <hi>Noahs;</hi> let us therefore doe good even to ſtrangers. This good will which is communicated to ſuch, ſavours leaſt of ſelf-love, and of ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and is therefore the more to be commended. It tends to the uniting of the common body of the world together, and to make all mankinde happy.</p>
            <p>And brethren, are not all (as they are men) equally deare to God? why therefore ſhould not all be in ſome meaſure deare to each other, I meane equally deare in reſpect of the common work of Creation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:27208:187"/>But <hi>Iacob</hi> here ſhewed ſpecially love to <hi>Rachel,</hi> for he ſalutes her;<note place="margin">19. He ſhewed ſpeciall love to <hi>Rachel</hi> his kinſwoman.</note> and takes paines to water her Sheepe. Surely a neare kinſwoman may challenge and muſt have a larger portion of love than a meere ſtranger, and he that is not ſomewhat moved by the title of Vncle, Couſin, and ſo forth, will ſcarce be moved by that of a man: they be therefore in ſome degree deſtitute of naturall affection, who are led nothing by kindred, unleſſe there be ſome riches found with a kinſman, by which he may doe them ſome credit or advantage.</p>
            <p>Let none of you be ſo, but ſhew due reſpect to a kinſman or kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, rich or poore; for maiſt not thou need their kindneſſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, as they thine for the preſent?</p>
            <p>And ſo much for <hi>Iacobs</hi> vertues to theſe ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>Now to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> he was a ſtranger too, but he was a King, and a King that had advanced his ſon <hi>Ioſeph:</hi>
               <note place="margin">20. He thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for his kindneſſe ſhewed to <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>
               </note> Wherefore comming and going he bleſſed him, that is, thanked him for his extraordinary kindneſſe to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and all his for <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſake, praying God to bleſſe him for it.</p>
            <p>So he was a thankfull man, and ready to give thankes for a benefit. So muſt we be to all that have pleaſured us, though they be far leſſe perſons, and have pleaſured us in far leſſer things. And thus of <hi>Iacobs</hi> vertues.</p>
            <p>Now of his faults, which are neither many nor great,<note place="margin">His faults.</note> but ſome they were, as there was never any man (except our Lord Ieſus Chriſt) in whom ſome ſin was not found:</p>
            <p>Firſt then, he was ſomewhat faulty towards God,<note place="margin">1. He was a little forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his Vow made to God. Gen. 35.1.</note> in that he did ſhew himſelf a little forgetfull of his Vow made to God in his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and deferred the performance of it ſomewhat too long, even till the Lord did force him unto it by a ſore chaſtiſement, and that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement would not ſerve to revive his memory, till in a Viſion the Lord ſpake unto him, and wiſhed him to goe to <hi>Bethel,</hi> and there to reare an Altar unto him, that had appeared to him when hee fled from the face of his brother. It was twenty yeares ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Vow, and <hi>Iacobs</hi> returne, ſo that it may ſeeme that <hi>Iacob</hi> had well neare forgotten the Vow. A good man may grow forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of a Vow in twenty yeares, and indeed omiſſions through forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and commiſſions through inconſiderateneſſe, are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted in good men. I pray you looke that none of you offend through the ſame example of forgetfulneſſe; indeed there are greater faults, but a good man muſt ſhew his uprightneſſe by forſaking all faults, great as well as ſmall, and ſmall as well as great.</p>
            <p>Now let me put you in minde of your former forgetfulneſſe: Is there none of you that hath formerly bound himſelfe to God by a Vow, and hath either deferred wittingly, or put off through forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe the accompliſhment of it? If ſo, let him now be induced to remember himſelfe, and to make all convenient haſt to make good his Vow, for feare the Lord ſend ſome heavy croſſe upon him, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:27208:188"/>
waken his conſcience by terrours. <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhould have conſidered his promiſe to God ſo ſoone as the Lord had brought him ſafely home to his Fathers houſe, but it ſeemeth he deferred it, for that was the time preſcribed in his Vow.</p>
            <p>I pray you doe as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhould have done, not as he did, in a thing wherein it is evident that he did amiſſe, and call to minde often the words of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.3.</note> 
               <hi>When thou voweſt a Vow unto the Lord, defer not to pay it, for he hath no pleaſure in fooles; pay what thou oweſt:</hi> and before him <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Law ſaith,<note place="margin">Deut. 23.22.</note> 
               <hi>Be not ſlack to performe thy Vowes.</hi> If you have tyed your ſoules in an oath to God, defer not from day today, bee not forgetfull.</p>
            <p>It is a great careleſneſſe to forget a great bond, and to let the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be put off from time to time; yet if any man have committed ſuch a ſin, he muſt not be diſcouraged: the ſin is not to be unduly extenuated, nor yet aggravated above meaſure. It is ſuch a fault as calleth for unfained repentance, and that done, ſhall bee pardoned; yea, the moſt wilfull breach of a Vow is pardonable to the penitent.</p>
            <p>But other faults he is to be blamed for in reſpect of his Parents:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 27. tot. 2. He abuſed his old Father with lies and diſſembling. Gen. 27.12.</note>Firſt, he abuſed his old Father with lies and diſſembling; the lie it ſelfe and diſſimulation we meddle not with in it ſelfe, but that hee bare ſo little reſpect unto aged <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as to goe about to mocke him with tricks and tales. Indeed before his doing of it his conſcience told him, that this was a ſin, and yet he was induced by his Mother to doe it. So he ſinned in this againſt his conſcience.</p>
            <p>Have any of you done the like offence, but in a worſe manner, and to a worſe end towards your Fathers, to hide your faults, or to wreſt money from them to ſerve the turne of your inordinate luſts, flapped them in the mouth, as our proverbe is, with leaſings, and abaſed the weakneſſe of their ſences, memory or diſcretion, with cheating tricks. This is a villany, God puniſhed it ſeverely in <hi>Iacob,</hi> though he did it at his Mothers inſtigation, and that to keep his Father from giving away the bleſſing. How much more muſt God puniſh in you, that perhaps have done it oftner, and that without any ſuch motive, and to far worſe purpoſes?</p>
            <p>Come, as you have ſinned with <hi>Iacob,</hi> repent with him, for though the Scripture doth not rehearſe his repentance in particular, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is commended for faith, wee are ſure that he could not but repent for ſo knowne a ſin, and ſo I beſeech you doe you all that are guilty, and you alſo ſhall be pardoned.</p>
            <p>And now doe not embolden your ſelves to ſin any of you by the abuſe of his example, for you ſee into how great miſery this fault caſt him; but rather learne by him to ſhun that which coſt him ſo deare. <hi>Iacob</hi> had not a former example to terrifie him, as you have his; <hi>Iacob</hi> had not the Scripture (as you have) to terrifie him: Let our hearts reſolve to hate a ſin, and ſtrive againſt it the more, becauſe in others we may ſee our aptneſſe to it. And let us beware that we paſſe not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:27208:188"/>
over-haſty cenſures upon them that have ſo offended, yea, though they have herein neglected the checks of their owne conſciences: We muſt not judge any man as an hypocrite, for any fault that is common to him, with <hi>Iacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, <hi>Iacob</hi> offended in regard of his mother,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. tot. 3. He obeyed his mother againſt Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> with an exceſſe of obedience, for he was ruled by her againſt Gods Commandement; ſhe bade him diſſemble and lie, and by her faire words and perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he was drawne to commit that great ſin of lying. It is an eaſie matter for Inferiours to obey their Governours carnally, not in the Lord, not with reſervation of their duty to God, but a little too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitedly, which is a fault that muſt needs be very offenſive to God.</p>
            <p>But take heed of this ſin I beſeech you, it is a preferring of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and an act that doth exceeding highly diſhonour God; now ſtrive to worke in your hearts ſuch an high eſteeme of God, that you may be reſolute not to ſin againſt him for the ſake of any man, though never ſo much your Superiour, though never ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
            <p>But if you have done otherwiſe, be not diſheartned, but returne unto God with confeſſions and humble petitions, renewing your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer purpoſes, and you ſhall be pardoned. For the Lord is at this time as abundant in mercy to all that call upon him, as formerly hee was: Neither let any man ſuffer himſelfe to entertaine too hard a conceit againſt another whom he ſhall ſee to have been either over-intreated, or by threatenings over-borne, to doe ſome evill thing at a Superiours motion; but conſider thine owne weakneſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that even <hi>Iacob</hi> did ſo too, and that when he was now paſt a childe, for he was at leaſt ſixty yeares when he did this, ſo that no part of the blame can fall on the weakneſſe of youth or childhood.</p>
            <p>But in reſpect of his children ſome faults he was guilty of.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he did exceſſively love <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 37.3. 4. He loved <hi>Ioſeph</hi> exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively.</note> and indiſcreetly manifeſt his love unto him, ſo that his brethren diſcerning it, were enviouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to him, and procured him much miſery.</p>
            <p>This is a weakneſſe of Parents, not alone to overlove ſome childe above the reſt, but alſo to ſhew it too apparently, to the breeding of envy in the hearts of the reſt, and ſometimes pride and ſelf-conceit in him that findes himſelfe over-loved, and ſo doth miſchiefe both wayes.</p>
            <p>Be inſtructed you Parents to moderate your affections to your children, and to each childe, and to moderate the demonſtrations of your affections; let them not be too vehement, too frequent, too fondling.</p>
            <p>I know it is in vaine to give this diriction to Parents, for they will not ſee out of the blindneſſe that love worketh, what is too vehement love, and what be too vehement expreſſions of it, and rules to diſcern it can hardly be given. For thoſe of not ſparing them in any ſin, and the like, doe diſcover rather the unſanctity of love in other reſpects,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:27208:189"/>
than the exceſſe. It is alone a fleſhly, not a ſpirituall love, when it will ſuffer them to ſin, but it may be exceſſive, though it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly carnall. Pray to God to diſcover it to you, and to reforme it in you; It is better to love too much than too little, <hi>But it is better to ſhew love too little,</hi> than to ſhew it too much, eſpecially if it be with partiality.</p>

            <p>The three laſt things concerning <hi>Iacob,</hi> are his benefits, croſſes, and death.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Spirituall.</note>Firſt, Spirituall. Secondly, Temporall.</p>
            <p>The ſpirituall benefits are of two ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The chiefe and principall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe that followed hereupon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:27208:189"/>The chiefe ſpirituall bleſſing was this,<note place="margin">1. He was a godly man.</note> that he made him a godly man, giving him true faith, ſo that he did unfainedly beleeve in God, and was a right godly and religious man. For it is noted of him, that he beleeved in God, and was an heire with <hi>Abraham</hi> of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, both concerning the land of Canaan, as a Type, and heaven it ſelfe, the thing figured by the land of Canaan; So <hi>Iacob</hi> was a true ſervant of God, and member of Chriſt, and inheritour of heaven, and from him the Church is many times called by the name of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And this is the greateſt good that can be found in this life, in compariſon of which, all other benefits are of no value, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, other things are not ſufficient to make a man happy, though he ſhould poſſeſſe them in never ſo great abundance; for what will it advantage a man to win the whole world, and loſe his owne ſoule.</p>
            <p>Now therefore we muſt learne moſt earneſtly to ſeeke this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which God is ready to give to us, as well as to him. For <hi>Iacob</hi> was not godly by nature, nor by any power of his owne, but by the free grace of God, and the mighty and ſaving worke of his owne bleſſed Spirit, which Spirit he hath promiſed to all that aske, even as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly as any tender hearted Father will give food unto his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry childe that ſhall crave it at his hands.</p>
            <p>Let no man be diſcouraged becauſe of the corruption and naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of his nature, for the ſame bad and depraved nature was found in <hi>Iacob</hi> that in himſelfe, ſeeing <hi>Iacob</hi> alſo was a ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature a childe of wrath, and heire of death as well as any other; but God did circumciſe his heart as well as his fleſh, and made him partaker of the divine nature, by which he prevailed againſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that are in the world through luſt. Wherefore let each of us take notice of his owne wickedneſſe, and inability to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe good, and of his manifold ſins, and inability to procure pardon of them to himſelfe; and let him earneſtly call upon God to worke true repentance, and unfained faith in him, and the Lord will graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly worke theſe things in him, as well as in <hi>Iacob,</hi> and will pardon his ſins, and ſanctifie his ſoule, and make him an inheritour of his heavenly Kingdome.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you therefore, bury not your ſelves in the world, and in the ſtudy of earthly things, but <hi>Seeke firſt the Kingdome of God, and his righteouſneſſe,</hi> and labour to come into the ſtate of grace by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Goſpell, ſeeing your miſery in your ſelves, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to turne unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>For in the Church no man is left deſtitute of grace, but through his own default in neglecting the great ſalvation that is there offered unto him.</p>
            <p>Againe, thoſe to whom the Lord hath pleaſed to ſhew the ſame goodneſſe, working in them true faith, inabling them to beleeve in his mercy through Chriſt, and to walke in his wayes with truth and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:27208:190"/>
uprightneſſe of heart, muſt learne to ſhew themſelves exceeding thankfull to God for this mercy, and ſtrive to take comfort in it, and to walke worthy of it. Bleſſe God with conſtant and daily bleſſings, that hath bleſſed thee with, ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt, and rejoyce in the riches of that inheritance to which thou are intereſſed and ſhalt poſſeſſe, whatſoever wants, afflictions, croſſes thou maiſt bee exerciſed withall; yet be glad in the Lord, and count thy ſelfe an happy man, becauſe the Lord hath granted thee that which may abundantly ſatisfie thy ſoule in the want of all outward things, and ſupport thee in all afflictions and miſeries, and countervaile, and more then overweigh all manner of calamities. <hi>Let not the rich man rejoyce in his riches, nor the wiſe man in his wiſdome, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength,</hi> nor any man in any terrene thing he hath, but <hi>Let him that rejoyceth, rejoyce in this, that he knoweth me ſaith the Lord.</hi> It is our duty to raiſe up our hearts ſo, that no earthly adverſity may coole or damp our prayers, and diſmay our hearts, and fill us with anguiſh and grief, and that no outward benefits may glut and ſatt our hearts, and turne us away from taking comfort in this true and everlaſting mercy.</p>
            <p>God hath made us his owne, given us faith, ſanctified us by his Spirit, united us to his Son, and cauſed us to ſee, beleeve, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his promiſes. What though we want wealth, honour, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and theſe ſenſuall benefits? He hath given us Wheate. What though he feed us not with huskes? He hath given us Gold. What though he lade us not with dirt? Hee hath given us himſelfe, and his Son. What though he give us not the vanities of this life? It is a ſin for a godly man to be out of heart and comfortleſſe, becauſe of any other want, and any other croſſe. If God have granted you this chiefe benefit, glory in it, and thinke that you have gotten a good portion, though your eſtate in the world be never ſo low and poore; only be ſure that your faith bee true, by cauſing you to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in thoſe fruits of it which we ſhewed you before, that it brought forth in <hi>Iacob.</hi>

            <p>This is an excellent mercy, to be freed from the curſe of the Law, and to be made partaker of the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham;</hi> even that God ſhall love one, take care of him, and proſper him in all things hee takes in hand, and conduct him ſafe to heaven at the length: Seeke this bleſſing of God; If you feare God and walke in his wayes, hee will bleſſe you, if you faithfully beleeve in Chriſt, and reſt upon him alone, you ſhall be bleſſed, for Chriſt hath freed us from the curſe, and prepared the bleſſing for us, if we be under the workes of the Law, we are under the curſe, but if we be of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> we ſhall be bleſſed with faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us.<note place="margin">Gal 3.9, 10.</note> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to beleeve, labour to goe out of your ſelves, and to ſtay alone upon the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by faith made yours, and then you ſhall inherite the bleſſing, and then you ſhall inherite the bleſſing, and then you ſhall receive the promiſe of the Spirit through faith, then God will keep his Covenant of grace with you, pardon your ſins, give you his Spirit, and make all worke together for good. <hi>Through faith and patience you muſt inherite the promiſes;</hi> and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which <hi>Eſau</hi> was excluded from, (though he would have inherited it,) becauſe he ſought it not of God, but of <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Father.</p>
            <p>And you that have right unto Gods bleſſing, becauſe you are faithfull, take comfort in it, and be thankfull for it. Gods bleſſing is a rich thing, it is more than all honours, it is fruitfull of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; he that is bleſſed of God ſhall want no good thing, ſhall have earth and heaven, and all things that his heart can deſire.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, but we ſee that ſuch men meete with evill enough in the world?</p>
            <p>The anſwer is, that if we looke with the eye of fleſh alone, wee thinke that we ſee it ſo, but we thinke falſly; for if wee would look with the eye of faith, we ſhould ſee it otherwiſe, for the bleſſing of God cauſeth croſſes to worke for our ſpirituall good, for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of holineſſe and happineſſe, and it is the efficacy of Gods bleſſing, that it turneth evill things unto good for them to whom it is granted: as it is the efficacy of Gods curſe, that it turneth all good things to hurt in them that lie under it.

            <p>And if God doe appeare to us ſo, you are to eſteeme highly of his favour, and to ſtudy to requite his mercy by a more carefull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to walke holily before, and with him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, a great ſpirituall bleſſing it was,<note place="margin">5.

And if we have found, and doe finde God favourable to us in this kinde, ſo that we loſe not our prayers which wee make unto him, let us then comfort our ſelves in this benefit, and be carefull to yeeld as obedient an eare to his word, as hee doth yeeld a patient eare to our ſupplications.</p>

Let us cleave to God, that hee may be out Buckler alſo, and our ſtrong Tower, and Rocke of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and if we have found ſo much favour with God, as to reſcue us out of ſuch dangers as ſeemed unpreventable, let not us attribute the deliverances to any other ſecondary cauſes, but even ſee God in them, aſcribe them to him, and learne thence to feare, honour, and praiſe him. Thoſe deliverances are indeed profitable, that are cords of kindneſſe to tie us nearer to God.</p>
            <p>Hee that improveth not ſuch benefits to that end, loſeth the moſt deſirable fruit of them.</p>

               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Iacob</hi> had a large off-ſpring.</note>Further, <hi>Iacob</hi> had a large off-ſpring of children, twelve ſons and one daughter, this is a favour to give a man ſtore of children; of

theſe ſons all had wealth enough, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was very religious in his youth, and <hi>Benjamin</hi> civill and orderly at leaſt, and at the end all of them turned home and became godly men. O happineſſe, to have ſo many children, ſome good betime, all holy at laſt! all proſperous in outward things, and one much advanced.</p>
            <p>Another mercy of God,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him and his in the famine.</note> was the providing of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> as a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to maintaine him and his family in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and bringing him to ſee <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and enjoy his preferment for ſeventeen yeares together, where he lived in as great a fulneſſe of proſperity, and concluded his dayes as happily as ever man did, living in <hi>Ioſephs</hi> boſome as it were, ſeeing all his children godly and proſperous, and feeling no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable adverſity, having <hi>Ioſephs</hi> oath alſo to bury him in Canaan. This is a ſingular favour of God, to make ones old age proſperous, and to cauſe his eyes to ſee ſo much happineſſe as he can wiſh, when now he is ready to leave the world.

            <p>Now for his death.</p>
            <p>It was a moſt ſeaſonable death, after a large time of life,<note place="margin">His death was ſeaſonable, peaceable, religious, and comfortable.</note> a moſt peaceable death in the midſt of his Sonnes, a moſt religious death, bleſſing them, and confirming their faith with his laſt words; a moſt comfortable death, ſo ſoone as he had ended his bleſſing, he pulled up his legs and gave up the Ghoſt; and then he had alſo an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable embalming and buriall, as at large is ſet downe in the Story.

            <p>And yet more, after death he hath an honourable name on earth,<note place="margin">After death he had an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable name.</note> and liveth in eternall glory in heaven.</p>

It could not but grieve <hi>Iacob,</hi> that his Father ſhould ſo diſaffect him, as to give away the bleſſing from him.

            <p>So have I briefly run over <hi>Iacobs</hi> miſeries, but they lay hard and heavy upon him. Of all which you muſt make theſe uſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, be thankfull for eſcaping the like, prepare for them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, beare thoſe that doe come, patiently. And take heed of provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God, for he is not a fond Father, but <hi>Will ſcourge every ſon whom he receiveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, you have heard how many miſeries this godly man was exerciſed withall: Let me propound one queſtion unto you. Thinke you that your ſelves have more wit than he had, or more goodneſſe, or more of both? I preſume I may make anſwer for you, that you will not be ſo over conceited of your ſelves, as to affirme either of theſe things.</p>
            <p>Now if you be neither wiſer, nor godlier than he; how commeth it that you have ſo long lived in the world, and yet have not met with divers of thoſe croſſes that followed him? No, nor any in all your lives ſo pinching or grievous. Sure if it be not to be attributed to your underſtanding, and piety (as it is not, if you doe indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge your ſelves to be not ſuperiour, or rather not equall unto <hi>Iacob</hi> therein, who yet did meete with them) then muſt you aſcribe the ſame to the wiſdome and goodneſſe of God, that hath diſpoſed of things ſo by his wakefull providence, as that ſuch miſeries have not way-laid you, and ſeized upon you. Therefore you muſt learne to be humbly thankfull to him, and praiſe his holy name, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his bountifulneſſe, graciouſneſſe, and tenderneſſe, that hath ſpared you from ſuch ſmarting ſtroakes, as theſe that fetched blood
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:27208:194"/>
and teares as it were from good <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſo holy a man. If we be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from croſſes that other men feele, wee begin to lift up our ſelves, to commend and prefer our ſelves above them that are heavier laden, and to flatter our ſelves, as if we were more loved of God than they; then our eaſe is our bane, and it ſhewes that we have not grace to make a good uſe of eaſe; but if we confeſſe that we have deſerved as much and more, and had as little ability to ſhun them, only God tendering our weakneſſe, hath uſed us with more clemency, and ſo make this clemency an argument of praiſing him, and of being more carefull to pleaſe him, who would not ſtrike us, though he had both provocation from us, and ability in himſelfe, this is an holy uſe of the abſence of the croſſe.</p>
            <p>Say then, waſt thou ever driven out of thine owne habitation, to ſerve in a ſtrange place, and an hard maſter that wronged thee, and uſed thee diſcurteouſly? Waſt thou ever in danger to have all thy goods taken from thee by an enraged man, ſtronger than thy ſelfe, and purſuing thee with a revengefull minde? nor waſt thou never in perill of thy life by a revengefull perſon armed with foure hundred ſouldiers? nor waſt thou never tormented with ſeeing thy ſonnes murderers, couzeners, and robbers? nor haſt thou never loſt a deare childe, and thought him ſlaine by a violent death? nor did never no ſon of thine commit inceſt with his mother in law? if not, ſee how favourable God hath been to thee above <hi>Iacob,</hi> and praiſe, love, an honour him, and make his gentleneſſe an argument of turning and obeying; for if thou compare thy ſins with <hi>Iacobs,</hi> there need be no doubt, but that thine have been as great as his, and thy repentance as little. But it is our good, not our ſins that God lookes to in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, as a Father corrects not a little childe for as great a fault, ſo much as he doth a ſtronger.</p>
            <p>Againe, learne to beare the croſſes thou haſt, with more patience and quietneſſe of minde, by comparing them with <hi>Iacobs</hi> croſſes, which have been more in number, and more weighty, and grievous.</p>
            <p>Why doth any of you my Brethren take the matter ſo heavily, that ſome childe of his is ſomewhat ſtubborne and ill diſpoſed? When none of them have committed murder, inceſt, rapine, and ſuch ſins as <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſons did commit. Why doe you make ſuch a ſtir at wrongs? When none of you were ever ſo purſued by any foe, as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was by his brother and Father in Law; Why doe you take on ſo for the ordinary and naturall death of a childe? ſeeing none of you hath had ſuch a childe torne by wilde beaſts, or ſome other like vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as <hi>Iacob</hi> conceived <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to have miſcarried. Why doe you complaine of famine, and of want? When none of you hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a famine as compelled him to ſend ſo far as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſent to Aegypt for Corne, which is thought to be not much leſſe than two hundred miles: We complaine of eaſe. If our ſo much lamented afflictions were laid in the ballance with <hi>Iacobs,</hi> we ſhould finde them
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:27208:194"/>
very light and trifling buſineſſes in compariſon. Want of looking about, and obſerving the burdens that are faſtened unto other mens ſhoulders, cauſeth us to aggravate our owne ſo much in our owne conceits, as that by making them ſeeme extraordinarily heavy, wee even wilfully caſt our ſelves into exceſſive ſorrow for them.</p>
            <p>But againe, you that are, yet at eaſe, and have not taſted any ſo bitter a cup as <hi>Iacob</hi> did many, muſt bee perſwaded to take ſome paines with your owne hearts, to make your ſelves thinke that ſome ſuch croſſes may befall you, and therefore to prepare for them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to beare them, and praying God to ſit you for them, and ſanctifie them to you.</p>
            <p>Mans ſelf-loving minde is willing to flatter it ſelfe with good hopes, rather then to forewarne it ſelfe with wiſe warnings: O I hope I ſhall never ſee my children, my wife ſo naught, I ſhall never finde ſuch ill uſage, I hope. Come hither vaine man, and either give a good reaſon of thine hopes, or elſe confeſſe them to be fruits of thine extreame folly, and doting ſelf-love.</p>
            <p>Hath God ever promiſed thee, that no ſuch thing ſhould befall thee? I am ſure thou canſt ſhew no ſuch promiſe. Haſt not thou deſerved as much as <hi>Iacob,</hi> to be ſeverely chaſtened of God? I am ſure thou oughteſt to ſay yes. Doth not thy body, ſoule, name, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, lie abroad in as open a Sea, and as tempeſtuous? Here alſo thou oughteſt to ſay yes, and therefore ſhouldeſt alſo condemne theſe ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſoft hopes of thine, and ſay, Well, God may make me as afflicted as <hi>Iacob,</hi> and therefore I will even expect the ſame, or as bad; and if they come I will beare them all, ſeeing God and my ill deſervings in them. Yonder is a very towardly boy, I love him dearely: what if I ſhould heare he were torne of beaſts? Lord if it be thy will, let it not be ſo; but if it be, make me to beare it with quietneſſe: and why ſhould I not ſo ſtoope to thy will in every thing; yea I will doe it by thy grace. If thou ſay, I ſee many eſcape ſuch croſſes.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, and thou ſeeſt many afflicted with them, and why maiſt not thou be amongſt the number of thoſe that ſuffer them, as well as of thoſe that eſcape them.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, take heed of making over-bold with Gods favour, as a wanton childe, that preſumes he ſhall not be whipt, and therefore cares not almoſt what wanton and evill prankes he playes. Doe you not ſee here that the Lord of heaven knowes how to whip his owne children throughly and to purpoſe? You have not to deale with a fooliſhly pittifull Father, that cannot finde in his heart to heare his children cry, and ſee them ſmart and bleed. No, he can ſtrike, he can lay it on ſoundly, he can make you roare, and cry, and bleed, hee can doe it; yea, and he will doe it too, if he finde that your conceit of his love and gentleneſſe brings forth no better fruit in you than this, that by preſuming of it, you are made more wicked.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſay to thy ſelfe, if ſuch abominable fancies ariſe;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:27208:195"/>
fooliſh man that I am, doe I ſo requite the Lords kindneſſe? Doe I put his clemency to this uſe? Did he not cut and wound <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſoul? Did he not handle him roughly? even though we never reade that he did entertaine ſuch preſumptuous conceits. How then will hee deale with me, if I doe ſo exceedingly provoke him, by ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly abuſing his goodneſſe? And ſo frame to condemne and blame thy wickedneſſe in having ſuch motions, and pray to God to worke in thine heart a reverend awe of his Majeſtie, by making his juſtice and anger ſo terrible to thee, as to make ſin abominable, that would inſence that wrath and juſtice againſt thee. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>

But he was drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this way of Polygamy by ſeverall occaſions.</p>
            <p>Now of his Wives, the true and lawfull Wife was <hi>Rachel,</hi> for her he agreed, with her he eſpouſed himſelfe (as it is like, for we cannot thinke but that after his Father had promiſed to give her to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeven yeares ſervice, he would acquaint her with it, and deſire her good will, and unleſſe he had attained it, the marriage would not have proceeded, and been as it was, ſolemnly celebrated) to her hee bare ſingular affection, and her alone he looked for.</p>

            <p>But of <hi>Rachel</hi> let us conſider after her Parentage, her life and death, and in her life: 1. Her faults. 2. Her vertues. 3. Her croſſes. 4. Her benefits, and ſo to her death.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Her faults.</note>Firſt then, her faults; She was a woman of great imperfections: theſe are plainly noted in her.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. She was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious toward her ſiſter.</note>Firſt, ſhe was envious towards her ſiſter, as you ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.1.

            <p>The firſt, and moſt remarkable example of this vice is found in <hi>Cain,</hi> it ſhewes it ſelfe here againe in <hi>Rachel.</hi> Let us conſider what a loathſome vice it is, that we may the better ſhun it. The Word of God hath given us frequent warning of it in blaming it ſo often, it ſhewes how apt we are to it, and how diligently we ſhould oppoſe it, and preſerve our ſelves from it;<note place="margin">Mark. 7.22.</note> our Saviour is pleaſed to reckon it among the evill things that come out of the heart, and doe defile the man, and giveth it the name of an evill eye, becauſe it ſhewes it ſelfe preſently in the eye and countenance, and cauſeth a dejected coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and a vile looke towards the party envied, as it is ſeen in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi> It is a paſſion that will not be kept in, but will bewray it ſelfe in odde lookes and caſts of the eye.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.29.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons it up among thoſe ſins wherewith the Gentiles were full, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Envy, murder, &amp;c.</hi> and you ſee with what companions he joynes it, murder, debate, for theſe indeed be the fruits that follow from it, as in <hi>Saul, Cain,</hi> and the Phariſees is evident. S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo reckons it amongſt the number of the things which are fruits of the fleſh,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.21.</note> and which he that doth, ſhall not inherite the kingdome of heaven, <hi>envyings, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> where you ſee likewiſe how he fellows it with murders, as he had done before.

For what could move him to ſeeke the overthrow of our firſt Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> but together with an hatred of God from whom himſelfe had fallen, an evill affection towards them that ſtood entire in that good eſtate, which himſelfe had loſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and true happineſſe? Now this vice is injurious to God, to the party envyed, to the enviers ſelfe, and to the ſocieties of mankinde.</p>
            <p>Firſt to God, to whom it will not grant the freedome of diſpoſing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:27208:196"/>
his owne gifts according to his owne good pleaſure. Envy againſt him that excels us, carries with it by way of implication at leaſt, and ſometimes expreſly, blaming, condemning, muttering againſt him that hath granted to another what he hath denied unto me. They murmured againſt the houſholder in the parable, that were troubled to ſee thoſe of the eleventh houre to have equall wages with them at the firſt.</p>
            <p>Now what an audaciouſneſſe is this in the creatures, to ſet rules to the Creator? and to binde him, that he ſhall not ſhew himſelfe more bountifull to another than to ones ſelfe. Are not we diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, if one childe grudge becauſe another hath a bigger or better thing than himſelfe? We cannot endure that our inferiours ſhould ſet lawes to us, and appoint us what to give to others, what to them: We muſt know our ſelves to forget our ſelves much if we will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to God, and it is nothing elſe but a very preſcribing to God, when we take occaſion from his bounty to repine. For if it be well done, why are we vexed? If not, upon whom is the blame laid?</p>
            <p>Further, it is a wrong to the party envyed, for it is to meaſure ſuch meaſure to him, as we would not have meaſured to our ſelves by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Who doth not blame another for vexing at his proſperity, and for having a grudge againſt him becauſe God hath done him good? Would we not that all ſhould rather love us, reſpect us more, and rejoyce with us? Therefore we doe injury to our neighbour, in do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing what we would not have done to our ſelves: The envious wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe both becauſe he doth vexe and eate out his owne heart to no purpoſe (for neither ſhall another proſper leſſe, nor he more, becauſe of ſuch his inordinate diſtempers) as alſo becauſe he makes himſelfe lie open to moſt grievous ſins of detracting, ſlandering and practiſing all injuries, yea, and murder at the laſt. He is in the high way that will lead him to many ſins, yea, to the ſhedding of inno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cent blood, that entertaineth this diabolicall humour of envy. And he wrongeth the whole ſociety, becauſe he is diſtempered at that which maketh for the common good, even the diſtribution of Gods gifts differently as himſelfe ſees fit, and in that he is broody of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, which all hinder the common welfare of the places where they be. Beſides, this is a fruit of pride and uncharitableneſſe, and muſt needs be hatefull to God, who loves only the humble and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Envy is a vice, unto the making of which many vices concurre: Ignorance, folly, pride, uncharitableneſſe, ſelf-love, and the like: It is a vice which bringeth forth many other vices, contention, ſtrife, ſwellings, tumults, whiſperings, back-bitings, murders and all evill deeds. Therefore let us finde it out, and chaſe it away: You ſhall eaſily perceive that it is a weed which growes in our corrupt nature. How ſoon doe children begin to ſhew it? how doth it grow ſtronger by continuance, increaſing in ſtrength as the body increaſeth? yea, how doth it live in old men too, and vexe them alſo that ſhould have
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:27208:197"/>
more underſtanding? as experience ſheweth. Indeed the elder can uſe more craft to hide it, but many times they have no more wiſdome to ſubdue it than the younger.</p>
            <p>I pray you finde it out each one in himſelfe, and fight againſt it, as one of the moſt loathſome fruits of the fleſh. And ſtrive you to get ſuch a meaſure of humility and charity, as may not alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you from this vice, but make you rejoyce with them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and turne the proſperity of others into matter of gladneſſe, even then when your ſelves want it: Happy is he that partakes in every mans happineſſe. It is in a mans power to taſte ſome of the ſweete of every mans eſtate, and to heale his wounds by a medicine made of comfortable rejoycing in their ſoundneſſe. Why ſhould we not make our ſelves merry at things, rather than ſad and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented? If we were ſo wiſe and godly as to ſeeke and deſire Gods glory as our maine end, then we ſhould rejoyce at all thoſe things which conduced to that end, and ſo doe the benefits beſtowed upon our brethren, as well as thoſe that our ſelves enjoy. If wee could bee lovers of the common good, and deſirers of the publike welfare, why the benefits of others further that, and therefore ſhould alſo glad us. Mankinde was encreaſed, the power of God in furniſhing the world demonſtrated by <hi>Leahs</hi> off ſpring, as well as if <hi>Rachel</hi> had conceived two, and ſhee two; be we therefore lovers of Gods glory, and lovers of the common good, and we ſhall not be envious. This vice ſometimes ſeekes a reaſon to hide its unreaſonableneſſe, by conceiting that anothers having ſuch things hinders himſelfe, and ſo it may fall out in ſome caſes; as when two ſtand in competition for the ſame thing: but this is no wrong though it be a damage, and therefore ſhould not produce any grudge. For ſeeing but one can have the thing, and he hath it; is it juſt to bee offended with him, that hath done no more to my ſelf, than I would have done to him? even preferred himſelfe before me: Wherefore ſee that you give not place to this wicked vice, but learne ſo to love your neighbours as your ſelves, that you may rejoyce in their proſperity as in your owne: But let us every man prepare himſelfe to meete with this fell monſter of envy, that if it encounter us, yet we may not be thruſt into diſtempers by it. It is not in any mans power to hinder the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and malignant natures of other men from ſhewing it ſelfe; but to be quiet, milde, and patient towards him that envies a man, that his wiſdome and charity ſhould inable him to performe; for is it not common to all good things, to come attended with envy? Was not Chriſt envied? Was not <hi>Paul?</hi> Have not the beſt been? Yea, wee muſt endure envy even from our neareſt kindred. The brother muſt bee prepared to ſuffer the envy of the brother, the ſiſter of the ſiſter, and muſt bee able to hold their ſpirits in ſuch order, that they may not leſſe love one that envies them, which yet is hard to love thoſe that uſe us ill. For by how
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:27208:197"/>
much envy proveth more implacable than other kindes of grudges, by ſo much carnall reaſon will bid us to bee more apt unto it; but Gods Spirit frames men to a gentle carriage. Pray God to make you of ſuch a temper, that you may bee able to ſhew kindneſſe even to him that envies you.</p>
            <p>I come to another fault of <hi>Rachels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. She was paſſionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               </note> ſhee was paſſionate and ſnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh towards her husband <hi>Iacob,</hi> and in a fume ſhee quarrels with him for not having children, as if it were his fault that her ſelfe was barren.</p>
            <p>It is a great fault in a wife to bee angry and finde fault with the husband without due cauſe, and to lay blame upon him when hee deſerveth it not, as did <hi>Sarah</hi> upon <hi>Abraham.</hi> It is contrary to the reverence, obedience, and love which they owe to their husbands: it is a meanes of eſtranging the husbands heart, by putting him into frequent fits of anger.</p>
            <p>You wives bee ſorrowfull if you have in ſuch a caſe over-ſhot your ſelves, and now labour for ſo much diſcretion and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wiſdome that may preſerve your tongues from ſpeaking paſſionately and unadviſedly to thoſe whom the Lord commands you to feare. What a fond ſpeech was <hi>Rachels? Give me children.</hi> Beware that anger doe not fill your mouthes with fooliſh words. And if this bee a fault in your Wives, good men, know it is a great fault in your ſelves, in whom more wiſdome is required. Nouriſh peace betwixt your ſelves, your yoake-fellows, and ſhunne angry and brawling words, that breede ſuch a koare of unkindneſſe as ſometimes runs forth into alienation, and perpetuall jarring.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Rachel</hi> was diſcontented, ſo that ſhee would die if ſhee had no children: ſhee doth not meane that ſhee would kill her ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt not put the worſt ſence, no not upon cholericke ſpeeches; but ſhe meaneth that ſhee thought her ſelfe no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than dead, that ſhee ſhould not enjoy her life, that it would doe her no good, that ſhee wiſhed her ſelfe rather dead than alive. This ſhee meaneth, and this is bad enough. O what a mixture of pride and folly is it, to wiſh ones ſelfe dead for ſo ſmall croſſes as this, that one hath continued a little while barren?</p>
            <p>Good men have beene over-taken with ſuch cloudes of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as have made them deſire death, but to bee weary of life becauſe one hath not a childe, I meete not with ſuch impatiency any where, but in <hi>Rachel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take heed to your ſelves, that no croſſes, no not the greateſt, draw ſuch diſtempers into your mindes, as to make you weary of life; but be much more aſhamed if a ſmall thing hath thus put you out. It is true, that many times this laviſh talke of Would I were dead, is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:27208:198"/>
from the teeth alone. If death ſhould offer it ſelfe at that inſtant, they would finde ſome other imployment for him, than to take them out of the world; but to be ſo full of diſcontent and vexation as to give vent to ſuch words, whether they ſeriouſly meane them or not, is a proofe of a man that doth not weigh things rightly in his minde. <hi>Rachel</hi> had a good husband, ſhe had likelihood of a good eſtate, and now lived abundantly, ſhee had the love of her husband, ſhee had health. What, and was not the fruition of all theſe able to make life ſweet to her, but ſhe muſt die if ſhe had not a childe? Did wee not forget or diſ eſteem the favours God hath ſhewed us, wee could never be put ſo far out of taſte as it were, that want of one benefit ſhould imbitter it ſelfe. But envy doth ſo rot the bones, that no eaſe can be felt of him that hath ſuffered that ſickneſſe to breed and grow ſtrong in him; Yea, ſee how all <hi>Hamans</hi> honour contented him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo long as <hi>Mordecai</hi> was an eye-ſore to him. Pray God to keep you from ſuch diſordered paſſions, and greatly bewaile them when you meet with them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. She brought her ſervant to her husband to be his wife.</note>But ſee another folly of <hi>Rachels.</hi> Shee brings her maid ſervant to her husband, and he muſt take her for his Concubine, to ſee if ſhee might be made a kinde of foſter-mother by her.</p>
            <p>Fond <hi>Rachel!</hi> was not <hi>Leah</hi> nearer to thee than <hi>Bilhah?</hi> Couldeſt thou not have eſteemed thy ſiſters children thine owne, as well as thy bondmaids? Here were two faults.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſhe preſſed her husband to Polygamy; but that was a fault of meere ignorance, let it be paſſed by.</p>
            <p>The next was, that ſhe would feed her ſelfe with a fancy, that they ſhould be her children which <hi>Bilhah</hi> ſhould beare, and not that <hi>Leah</hi> had borne.</p>
            <p>Nature made <hi>Leah</hi> deare to her, the bondwoman was of no ſuch kindred; but ſhe forgets nature, and lets fancy over-rule, ſhee had taken ſuch a conceit againſt her ſiſter, that ſhe was deſirous any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould have children by their common husband, rather than ſhe. Let us ſee ſuch follies in our ſelves, that fancy rules us againſt all reaſon, and that we ſometimes take ſuch a ſtitch and ſpleene againſt thoſe whom nature hath tyed to us, that of all other we are leſſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with their proſperity, and moſt eſtranged from them. And let us beware that we doe not diſcover ſuch ſenceleſſe and abſurd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of minde.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. She makes God a partner with her fond paſſions.</note>And ſee her folly yet further, when <hi>Bilhah</hi> had <hi>Dan,</hi> then ſhee will needs make God an approver of their folly, <hi>God hath judged:</hi> as if ſhe had great wrong before, and now God had righted it in giving her a ſon: Why, ſhe might have accounted that God had given her a ſon when <hi>Reuben</hi> or <hi>Iudah</hi> was borne, as well as <hi>Dan?</hi> But ſhee will needs make God partner with her fond paſſions. Wee are apt to wrong God in miſinterpreting the acts of his providence, as if hee ſhewed his love unto us in that wherein his Majeſty intended no
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:27208:198"/>
ſuch matter. What is it to judge? that ſhe ſhould ſay, God had judged her. For my part I can ſee no ſence in her words, why this ſhould bee counted an act of Gods judging. No man had wronged her before, ſhe was never a whit better now than before, no whit leſſe barren. But ſuch is our fooliſh ſelf-love, that wee will needs threape kindneſſe upon God ſometimes beyond his liking; take heed of this fault, it is a fruit of an overmeane con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceit of God, when we will cauſe him to be a ſervant to our luſts, and unreaſonable fancies.</p>
            <p>But after the ſecond childe ſhe is more fooliſh,<note place="margin">5. She inſults over her ſiſter becauſe ſhee won her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to beget children of her handmaid.</note> and then ſhe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, <hi>With wraſtlings of God have I wraſtled with my ſiſter, and I have prevailed:</hi> And ſo the boyes name muſt needs be <hi>Nephthali.</hi> She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults over her ſiſter, as for a notable victory, becauſe ſhe had won her husband ſo far, as to beget children of her handmaide. Why ſaith ſhe that ſhe had wraſtled with her ſiſter? Did <hi>Leah</hi> hinder her from children? Was it becauſe of <hi>Iacobs</hi> doting on <hi>Leah,</hi> that <hi>Rachel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not? Sure the Holy Ghoſt tels us that his over-loving of her, and deſpiſing of her ſiſter cauſed God to humble her with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe.</p>
            <p>So fooliſh is a man, that he often triumphs in a thing as a great matter, which is nothing at all, and thinkes he hath gotten a victory, when he hath rather gotten a blot, as we ſee here in <hi>Rachel.</hi> Let us moderate our joyes, and take heed of inſulting in a thing that hath ſhewed our folly, and elſe nothing advantaged us.</p>
            <p>Now another weakneſſe is,<note place="margin">6. She was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver earneſtly deſirous of <hi>Reubens</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes.</note> that ſhe was ſo earneſtly deſirous of <hi>Reubens</hi> Mandrakes. I conſent to them that thinke theſe Mandrakes to have been nothing elſe but goodly flowers, which <hi>Reuben,</hi> who was now ſome ſix or ſeven yeares old, had gathered in the fields, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were ſome pleaſant fruit or nor, I cannot tell; the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Lovelineſſes,</hi> ſuch things as were lovely. But that <hi>Rachel</hi> had ſuch an appetite to them, as ſhe muſt needs have ſome of them, it ſhews that ſhe was a woman given too much to her fancy and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. If in caſe of breeding children, and weakneſſe of body, ſome diſtempers follow, it is a miſery, but it wants not a ſpice of ſinne too, when by yeelding overmuch to the eye, a man is ſo enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to his eye, that he muſt have every fine thing he ſees. <hi>Rachel</hi> is the copy of a fond woman; all you good women ſee her follies to avoid them.</p>
            <p>But the worſt and laſt fault is,<note place="margin">7. She ſtole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Idols, and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with him afterward.</note> ſhe ſtole her Fathers Idols and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed them with diſſembling and falſe excuſes. Shee had beene wife to <hi>Iacob</hi> for twenty yeares ſpace, ſhe had called upon God for a childe, and he had given her a ſon, ſhe had ſhewed ſome faith in him, by calling the ſon <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> profeſſing her hope of having yet another ſon. Either we muſt throw an imputation of great care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe upon <hi>Iacob</hi> if hee taught her not the true God, and his true worſhip, or elſe upon her, that after ſo long time of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:27208:199"/>
teaching had not gotten her out of thoſe Idolatrous fancies, but muſt even ſteale away with her her Fathers Idols, it was not done out of deteſtation of Idolatry, to free her Fathers houſe from them, that ſhe might have done without the trouble of carrying them ſo far, ſhe might have burnt them, or otherwiſe deſtroyed them ſure enough: but I conceive ſhe did it out of a ſuperſtitious conceit of ſome goodneſſe in the gods, or in thoſe pictures of gods. The word ſignifies <hi>Images of men,</hi> and they were belike little Images, elſe ſhee could not have conveighed them ſo quickly, and ſo ſecretly, but that they would have been knowne. It is much adoe to weare ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of the heart of one that hath been ſuperſtitiouſly brought up.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt place that I remember in which theſe Idols are mentioned, but <hi>Rachel</hi> had ſo drunke in the opinion of their being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, that ſhe could not lay it aſide. It is no eaſie matter to leave ſuch falſhoods in points of religion, as have prevailed in the places, and among the perſons with whom ones ſelfe was trained up. Wee ſhould bleſſe God that hath granted us education in the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, we muſt even pitty them, that have been ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly educated. They may have ſome good thing in them, though they cannot ſhake off thoſe miſconceits, but hanker too much after their Images. I would be loath to ſay, and I thinke ſo would any of you that <hi>Rachel</hi> had no true piety in her, becauſe ſhe ſtood ſo affected to the Idols of her Father. But let us rather thinke that <hi>Iacob</hi> had brought her to ſome knowledge of the true God, though the old ſmell of that falſhood wherewith ſhe was firſt ſeaſoned, would not forſake the veſſell: and let us ſtrive to bring our children rather into a deteſtation of ſuch graven Images, for ſure the Lord can ſpeake of nothing more contemptibly. And Images made now to repreſent the true God, muſt needs be as loathſome as <hi>Aarons</hi> and <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Calves, which were intended to repreſent the true God, and not a falſe. But ſhe uſed diſſembling, and coſenage to cover her fact, as the Story tells, hiding them in the Camels litter, and then ſitting upon them, and craving pardon of her Father for not riſing up to him, pretending, that the cuſtome of women was upon her; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this were true or not, yet ſhe diſſembled, for that was not the cauſe of her not riſing, but alone the care ſhe had to keepe the Idols ſecret, elſe ſhe would have riſen well enough. You ſee that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of evill drawes men on to more ſin, to hide and conceale that which they have already committed, as it did <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and others, becauſe feare of ſhame or danger diſturbeth the minde, and turneth away the thoughts from conſidering the miſchief of ſinning. Therefore let us all take heed of entring into the path of evill, for if we be once in, no man can tell what lying, diſſembling, and other evils the devill will draw us into by meanes of that ſin. He intangles himſelfe as a ſheepe in the bryers, that run into any groſſe or ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:27208:199"/>
ſin, and he can hardly come off with one wound alone. And if you have thus covered ſin with ſin, bewaile it as a great fault, but yet take heart to repent, and turne to God for favour, for it is no new thing with God to forgive ſuch treſpaſſes, only doe not embolden your ſelves of purpoſe to ſin, becauſe you know how to conceale it, and hope to keepe it cloſe, for then ſhall the ſame become a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſin, and ſo much more hardly pardoned.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewed you <hi>Rachels</hi> faults. Her good deeds be but few,<note place="margin">Her vertues.</note> yet ſome:</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſhe was one of her Fathers ſheep-keepers,<note place="margin">1. She was one of her Fathers ſheep-keepers.</note> and did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to drive them to the water, at leaſt when the Shepheards were otherwiſe imployed. So it is a commendable thing in a young maide, to be ready to take paines, and doe ſervice in domeſticall bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, ſuch as accord to her Fathers ſtate. But an idle, coy, finiſh maide is ſo much the more diſdained of wiſe perſons, by how much ſhe doth more diſdaine labour in any profitable buſineſſe for which God did make men.</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>Rachel</hi> at laſt ſaw God in her barrenneſſe,<note place="margin">2. Shee ſaw God in her barrenneſſe at laſt, and fell to prayer.</note> and fell to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for it is ſaid, <hi>God hearkened to her, and opened her wombe.</hi> This gives us ſome hope that ſhe was humbled, and ſought God, which is good in our wants of any good thing, by it to be drawne to God in fervent prayers. Then be they graciouſly ſupplyed, when our need of them makes us ſupplicate to his bounty: <hi>Rachel</hi> got nothing by chafing, envying, or giving her maide to her husband, all that time the womb is not opened; but when ſhe remembred God, God remembred her; and when ſhe prayed, he hearkened and gave her a ſon. Let us in all our neceſſities make all the haſt we can to this remedy, comfort and deliverance will never come halfe ſo happily by other meanes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this. They be our prayers that muſt ſanctifie other meanes, and procure Gods co-operation with them for our good ſucceſſe. <hi>Iacob</hi> was <hi>Rachels</hi> husband before, but prayer had not made her fruitfull till now. God is the ruler of all things, learne to call upon him and truſt in him; He can remove any croſſe, as well as barrenneſſe.</p>
            <p>Againe, it was a good thing in her to deſire children,<note place="margin">3. She deſired children, and when ſhe had one, bleſſed God for him.</note> and when ſhe had one, to ſee God, and bleſſe him, and ſay, <hi>God hath taken away my reproach.</hi> When we have gotten things by prayer, we muſt alſo ſee God in them, and give him thankes; yea ſhe ſaith, <hi>God will give me yet another ſon;</hi> the thankfull receiving of one benefit, may aſſure us of another, God will adde to mercies, if we take notice of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe after we have called upon him in hearing our requeſt. Every benefit gotten by prayer, may and ſhould be called a <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another good thing was,<note place="margin">4. She reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted a kindneſs from her ſiſter (for all her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy) and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a kindneſs to her.</note> that her envy to her ſiſter did not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with her, but that ſhe would aske her for her ſons Mandrakes.</p>
            <p>Though the humour of envy was ſharpe in her, yet it may ſeeme to have waxed a little milder after a while, and ſhe could both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt a kindneſſe from her, and returne a kindneſſe to her. Let us
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:27208:200"/>
looke that envy doe not continue in its height, ſo as ſometimes it doth, to make us grow bitter enemies. And ſhe did well in granting to <hi>Iacobs</hi> motion to returne into Canaan, for a wife is to forſake Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Mother, and cleave to her husband. Shee ſhall doe farre amiſſe that prefers not her husband before her Parents, and goes not with him rather than tarries with them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. She prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band before her Parents. 3. Her croſſes. 1. She was barren.</note>So you have what is good and bad in her; now looke upon her croſſes; we can finde but few, and one which at laſt too was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſhe was barren: This barrenneſſe God ſent of purpoſe to keepe her downe, becauſe ſhe ſhould not too much ſleight her ſiſter; but ſhe made this a great croſſe, though it be no great one in it ſelfe; you ſee that barrenneſſe is a croſſe, and to ſome people a great croſſe, becauſe of their earneſt deſire of iſſue on ſome or other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But it is needfull that God tame and humble us with ſome or other croſſes, and either make them great, or make uſe of our folly to our further humbling, by giving us over to our ſelves, to make them great that elſe would not be ſo. Wee muſt pray God to ſanctifie croſſes, and then we ſhall never repent of them when they be paſt: many a man hath repented for other things, but ſanctified croſſes were never yet bewailed afterwards. Perhaps one may eſteeme it a croſſe that ſhe was faine to leave her Fathers houſe, but indeed that was a benefit, for by that meanes ſhe was quite (we hope) freed from the Idolatry of her Fathers houſe, from which, ſo long as ſhe lived there, ſhe was not quite purged.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2.

She entertained him very lovingly when he came home from field, and ſhe had hired him of her ſiſter.

If he offered her violence, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized her by any device, it was his fault, not hers; but it is not likely to have been ſo, becauſe God doth not report it ſo. For God would not wrong any in reporting their acts to the worſt, but if there had been any excuſe of her fault, the Lord would have done her right in rehearſing it, he ſhould not elſe doe the office of a good writer of a Story. O let all women take heed of adultery, and chiefly of inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adulteries with their husbands ſon in law, or brothers, or a like neare of blood, where the offence is made much more heinous by that aggravation: and if any have committed any ſuch crime, let the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of it in this woman bring it to their remembrance, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to repentance, that they may not have ſo fearefull a crime to anſwer for upon their ſick-bed in the houre of death. Likely ſuch groſſe crimes will cry out then, if they have been ſmothered before; but a conſcience purged from them by ſincere repentance performed in health, may enjoy quiet and peace in death, notwithſtanding the remembrance of them. For a ſin repented of ſhall be pardoned, and a pardoned debt cannot hurt at all, not ſo much as terrifie, if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of it be knowne. But ſomething there was in it, that God ſaw it fit to have his Church ſtored with the ſeed of bond-women, (for two of <hi>Iacobs</hi> wives were ſuch) becauſe he would have us know, that hee doth not much ſtand upon nobility, and being free borne, and the like. One third part of his people Iſrael were ſeed of bond-women. Though he would not let <hi>Hagars</hi> ſeed inherite, yet that was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did looke to her condition, but that he might figuratively ſet forth his averſneſſe from them, that will needs be in bondage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, when the Goſpell brings them liberty, and therefore now he doth equally take into the Church, <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Nephthali, Gad</hi> and <hi>Aſher;</hi> as well as <hi>Reuben,</hi> and <hi>Levi, Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Iudah.</hi> Theſe earthly conſiderations vary nothing with God, nor is the one any more acceptable with him than the other.

Spirituall priviledges may belong to thoſe that are of no reckoning in the world, and thoſe that are of high eſteeme in it may be deprived of them. The Tribes that came of the bond-woman were admitted into the poſſeſſion of Canaan, and to the fellowſhip of the Tabernacle as well as the reſt.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:27208:203"/>
of which all the world, and by name the countrey was then full. So hee was the Idolatrous ſon of an Idolatrous Father, and Grandfather, which did as moſt men doe, take up the religion of his forefathers without more adoe, not looking whether hee ſerved God aright, but counted it ſufficient to ſerve God as his Progenitors had done before, not at all conſidering whether it were the true God or the falſe whom they ſerved,<note place="margin">His life.</note> or whether it were true or falſe worſhip which they performed.</p>

            <p>Theſe good deeds of his looke partly to men, and partly to God.</p>

               </note>Firſt, let us conſider his carriage to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant <hi>Eliezer</hi> of Damaſcus, who was ſent by his maſter <hi>Abraham,</hi> to fetch a wife for his ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> out of <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> becauſe he would not match him with the curſed ſeed of the Canaanites.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing commendable in him is, that hee vouchſafeth curteous entertainment unto him; for when the ſervant meeting with <hi>Rebekkah</hi> had found great kindneſſe from her in watering his Camels, as well as giving himſelfe drinke out of her pitcher, and that hee had rewarded her with precious gifts, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.22. <hi>viz.</hi> with a golden eare-ring of halfe a ſhekel weight, and two golden bracelets of ten ſhekels weight for her hands; and that ſhee had invited him to her Fathers houſe, and comming home had told <hi>Laban</hi> her brother of the man, who hee was, and what hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon her: preſently <hi>Laban</hi> goes forth to the man, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. and invites him to the houſe with very kinde words, ſaying, <hi>Come in thou bleſſed of the Lord, wherefore ſtandeſt thou without? for I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the houſe and roome for thy Camels: and ſo bringing him home, they ungirded the Camels, and hee gave him ſtraw and provender for them, and water to waſh his feete, and the feete of thoſe that were with him, and then ſet meate before him, that hee might eate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Loe here, an example of curteous hoſpitality, hee gave him good and loving words, and provided and miniſtred to him all things neceſſary for his cattell, and companions, and himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhould men uſe kinde and liberall hoſpitality towards ſuch friends as upon occaſion doe repaire unto their houſes, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:27208:203"/>
this is a kinde of vertue which may bee found in men that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all true grace and piety. For even nature it ſelfe teacheth men to ſhew love and humanity to men that are of the ſame nature with themſelves, becauſe they looke to finde the like gentleneſſe themſelves from others upon like occaſions.</p>
            <p>Here is one thing in <hi>Laban</hi> worthy praiſe and imitation:<note place="margin">2. He gave him an honeſt and good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> another is, that hee gives him an honeſt and good anſwer when hee had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto them his errand. For the man refuſing to eate till hee had related his buſineſſe unto them, being very faithfull to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and diligent in the matter committed to his truſt, up and told them all that had fallen out, why hee came thither, and how hee had by a ſpeciall providence of God met with <hi>Rebekkah</hi> at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of water, requeſted to know their minde, and what hee muſt truſt unto in this matter: and from <hi>Bethuel</hi> the maides Father, and <hi>Laban</hi> of whom wee are ſpeaking, her Brother, hee received this juſt and diſcreete anſwer, <hi>That the thing proceeded from God, and they were able to ſay neither good nor bad unto him:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Neither by faire meanes nor by ſoule.</note> not to croſſe his motion by any allegation one way or other; concluding, that <hi>Rebekkah</hi> was before him, and that hee might with their good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent take her and goe, that ſhee might bee his Maſters ſons wife, as God had ſpoken, <hi>ver.</hi> 50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 51. of the ſame Chapter.</p>
            <p>In this paſſage you ſee a great deale of honeſt plainneſſe; ſeeing God had directed him by his ſpeciall hand to this maiden, they would bee no hinderance unto him, but would give their willing conſent to the marriage.</p>
            <p>It is a good thing for men to conſent unto honeſt and good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, chiefly when they ſee God himſelfe by his good providence going before them, and as it were, leading the way unto them.</p>
            <p>A third good thing in <hi>Laban</hi> was,<note place="margin">3. He ſpeedily diſmiſſed him.</note> that hee doth ſpeedily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe the man, and hindered not his preſent returne unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, with a wife for his ſon. For ſo it is written <hi>ver.</hi> 59. that when hee riſing betimes in the morning was earneſt to returne that very day, and that they at firſt required ten dayes ſtay for <hi>Rebekkah,</hi> but hee requeſting them not to hinder his expedition, ſeeing God had proſpered him; they called the Damſell and asked her conſent, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether ſhee was willing to goe with the man? and finding her very forward, they ſent her away without further lingring.</p>
            <p>It is a good thing, when wee have entertained any one in our houſe, and his deſire is as his occaſions ſhall require to make haſte home, to further him by all meanes, and not to ſtop his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with delayes. For many times ſuch deferring proves very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, and ſometimes dangerous to the party to whom wee would ſeeme to ſhew love and good will, as wee ſee it did in caſe of the Levite, whoſe Father in Laws importunity cauſed him to ſtay a day or two beyond his deſire, in the later end of the Story of <hi>Iudges.</hi>

            <p>But now it is time that we ſhew <hi>Labans</hi> good carriage to <hi>Iacob,</hi> the ſon of this his ſiſter a long time after.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. He loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained <hi>Iacob</hi> when he came unto him.</note>Firſt, hee doth lovingly entertaine him alſo when hee came unto him but even in a poore and naked faſhion, nothing ſo richly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided nor attended as the forenamed ſervant was in the former narration. <hi>Iacob</hi> came all alone, and with nothing almoſt but his ſtaffe in his hand, but yet when hee had faithfully report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him both who hee was, and what occaſion drove him in ſuch manner out of his Fathers houſe, hee receiveth him with all curteſie. For it is noted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.12, 13, 14. That when <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> had heard of <hi>Iacobs</hi> mouth who he was, and had acquainted her Father with his comming, hee hearing this tidings of his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſonne, ranne to meete him, and embraced him, and kiſſed him, and brought him to his houſe, and when <hi>Iacob</hi> had certified him of his matters, hee anſwered him lovingly, ſaying, <hi>Surely thou art my bone and my fleſh;</hi> that is, bee not troubled for theſe things, I acknowledge thee to bee my kinſman, and I will carry my ſelfe towards thee accordingly.</p>
            <p>Loe, how a man voide of true religion, may yet have good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affection to his kinſman, and that though he finde him in ſomewhat a poore caſe, and deſtitute of things needfull. And doubtleſſe it is a vertue, and deſerveth praiſe, to ſtand ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto ones kinſmen or kinſwomen, that are as <hi>Laban</hi> could ſay, <hi>Our bone and fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neareneſſe of blood requires ſome ſpeciall love and reſpect to thoſe to whom nature hath ſo nearely united to us. Every man promiſeth himſelfe kindneſſe from ſuch perſons, and therefore the common phraſe of the world hath entitled them friends by a kinde of excellency, becauſe they ſhould be forward to performe all loving and friendly offices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:27208:204"/>Another vertue in <hi>Laban</hi> is,<note place="margin">6. Of his own accord he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Iacob</hi> wages for his worke.</note> that of his owne accord hee doth offer wages or recompence unto him for his worke, for perceiving him to be of an induſtrious diſpoſition, that knew not how to paſſe his time idlely, though in a ſtrange place, and withall, skilfull and underſtanding in matters of ſuch nature as <hi>Labans</hi> calling ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> in Cattell, hee ſayes thus unto him, ver. 15. <hi>Becauſe thou art my brother,</hi> that is, kinſman, <hi>Shouldeſt thou ſerve mee for nought?</hi> that is, that were an unreaſonable thing indeed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tell me, what ſhall thy wages be.</p>
            <p>Loe, he would not deale ſo unjuſtly with his kinſman, as to take his labour and ſervice for nothing, but is willing to give him ſuch convenient ſatisfaction as he ſhould demand.</p>
            <p>This is ſuch a point of righteouſneſſe and equity, as even nature it ſelfe doth teach, and a meere naturall man, not too much over run with worldlineſſe of minde, may practiſe towards others. For ſeeing every man muſt make himſelfe the meaſure of his dealing with his neighbour, and that it cannot but ſeeme unrighteous to any man, if he bee driven to worke for nothing, ſurely he cannot but conclude, that himſelfe alſo is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the labour and ſervice of another. And this juſtice was ſo well knowne to <hi>Laban,</hi> and hee had ſo much goodneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in him afterwards too, that hee continues to exerciſe it after <hi>Iacob</hi> had finiſhed his fourteene yeares ſervice, and was now to make a new bargaine, as you ſhall reade <hi>Chap.</hi> 30. <hi>ver.</hi> 25. and 35. For when <hi>Iacob</hi> requeſted his good will to returne home, becauſe hee knew how faithfully hee had ſerved, hee acknowledges his pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and truſtineſſe, and his good ſucceſſe too, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requeſts him to tarry with him, and makes him this offer, ſaying, <hi>Appoint mee thy wages and I will give it;</hi> and when <hi>Iacob</hi> made a reaſonable motion, (that for the clearing of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and preventing of all miſtakings, hee might have for his wages the ſpeckled and ſpotted amongſt the Goates, and the browne amongſt the Sheepe, that ſhould after bee yeaned hee meaneth) he agrees to the condition, and ſo <hi>Iacob</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſerve him on theſe termes. Here you ſee juſtice in <hi>Laban,</hi> hee is willing to give his ſervant due wages for his worke. This point of equity is written in nature, and little goodneſſe is left in him that doth not know and follow it.</p>
            <p>So you have <hi>Labans</hi> juſt dealing with <hi>Iacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now looke into a third thing commendable in him, and that is,<note place="margin">7. He was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to beſtow his daughters upon him.</note> when <hi>Iacob</hi> offers to ſerve him ſeven yeares for his younger daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Rachel, Chap.</hi> 29. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19. He conſents to the motion, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>It is better that I give her to thee than to another man, and ſo bids him abide with him:</hi> that is, I will give her thee on this condition, and not only ſo, but hee puts upon him the elder daughter, and ſo makes him his ſon in Law in both of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:27208:205"/>That which was faulty in this paſſage, we ſhall ſpeake of anon, when we come to mention his faults; but this was a good thing in him, that he liked ſo well of <hi>Iacobs</hi> carriage, that he was willing to beſtow his daughters upon him.</p>
            <p>It is a matter both of prudence and honeſty too, to like ſo well of the vertue and good qualities of an honeſt and good man, as to be willing for theſe things ſake (other matters not too too much gain-ſaying) to make choice of him for a ſon in Law.</p>
            <p>The qualities of a man are principally to bee regarded in the choice of a ſonne in Law, and yet hee is not truly diſcreete and wiſe, that doth not looke unto this thing in the choice of an husband for his daughter. A perſon painfull, diligent, thrifty, and of good carriage, and ſufficiencies is rather to bee taken, than one deſtitute of theſe qualities, though hee bee farre more high and rich.</p>
            <p>It is the husbands ſelfe that will make the Wives life either moſt miſerable or moſt happy: and <hi>Laban</hi> did well in making ſuch a choice, and never ſhall he repent the match that findeth theſe things in him with whom hee matcheth; but without theſe things in the perſon, the ſtate and quality of the man in other reſpects cannot hinder, but that a little time will make both Father and daughter too, unwiſh the bargaine they have made.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">8 He quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid downe his anger, and made a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him.</note>How let us ſee what was good in <hi>Laban,</hi> in the very cloze of all with <hi>Iacob,</hi> as you have it <hi>Chap.</hi> 31.44. <hi>ad finem.</hi> He layes by all anger and diſcontent, and conſidering the neareneſſe that was betwixt them, hee made the motion of entring into covenant with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and ſo they ſolemnly ratifie the covenant, by ſetting up an heape of ſtones, and feaſting upon the heape, and eating and drinking lovingly and chearefully together, and by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oath each to other.</p>
            <p>It is a good thing to ſwallow downe all jarres and differences that fall out betwixt ones ſelfe and his friends and neighbours, and to part lovingly and curteouſly each from other in peace and concord, not in diſcontents and heart-burnings. Surely quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels would not bee held up long betwixt kinſmen and allyes ſpecially, but though they have met in a kinde of heate, and anger, and jealouſie one of another, yet they ſhould cauſe all theſe things to depart from them, and bee friends before they depart one from another.</p>
            <p>Peace is a comfortable thing, and it is a praiſe-worthy thing to ſpeake the firſt word of agreement.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">9. He ſheweth himſelfe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and kind to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and grandchildren</note>And ſo much for <hi>Labans</hi> carriage to <hi>Iacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to his daughters and grandchildren hee ſhewes himſelfe alſo loving and kinde, both taking care for them, and even binding <hi>Iacob</hi> by covenant to uſe them well; <hi>ver.</hi> 49. <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:27208:205"/>
alſo kiſſing them, and bleſſing them at the time of parting. A Father ſhould bee carefull of his childrens welfare, even when hee hath placed them forth into other families, and ſhould ſhew all curteſie and love unto them when hee parts with them, hee ſhould get good husbands for his daughters, ſo farre as hee can, and uſe all good meanes to make them live lovingly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Laban</hi> did both theſe offices to his daughters, and every Parent ſhould attaine at leaſt ſo much goodneſſe as a <hi>Laban.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But one thing more wee note in <hi>Laban,</hi> and that is,<note place="margin">10. He made a feaſt at the marriage of his daughter.</note> hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the neighbours, and made a feaſt at the marriage of his daughters. <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. A wedding feaſt is not indeed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, but it is of commendable uſe, ſo that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and diſorders bee avoided, and unleſſe juſt cauſe bee to the contrary, it hath a ſmacke of niggardlineſſe to neglect it. A man ſhould doe well to ſhew love to his neighbours, and to be willing to embrace fit opportunities of inviting and feaſting them; only ſtill ſo, that immoderateneſſe of all ſorts be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that a man keepe himſelfe within the compare of his place and meanes, and affect not vaine-glorious ſuperfluity in feaſting.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for <hi>Labans</hi> goodneſſe to man-ward, now to God-ward ſomething is good in him.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">11. He tooke notice of Gods bleſſing as the cauſe of his proſperity.</note> that hee tooke notice of Gods bleſſing to bee the cauſe of his proſperity by <hi>Iacobs</hi> labours, as you reade <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.27. <hi>I have learned by experience, that God hath bleſſed mee for thy ſake.</hi> Surely it is a good thing to put ones ſelfe in minde that <hi>Gods bleſſing makes rich;</hi> yea, and to obſerve how his bleſſing attends his faithfull people too in the labours of their hands. <hi>Laban</hi> aſcribes his riches to the bleſſing of God following <hi>Iacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a good thing to have ones eyes ſo farre opened towards God, and to marke by experience his favourable proceeding towards his faithfull ſervants, as it ſeemes alſo <hi>Ioſephs</hi> maſter did, and it is ſure <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did when he was his ſervant, and <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> towards <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three children, as alſo <hi>Darius</hi> in his time.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">12. He forbore what God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad.</note> when God met <hi>Laban</hi> by the way and commanded him to ſpeake to <hi>Iacob</hi> neither good nor bad (that is, not to hinder his journey either by faire meanes or ſoule) hee both acknowledgeth it, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. and accordingly obeyes it, for hee diſmiſſeth him peaceably, and ſtops him not in his courſe home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, though as hee ſaith, it was in his power to have done otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>This is to bee praiſed in him, that what God forbad him, hee forbeares, though hee ſaw otherwiſe no danger in it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the duty of a man is to abſtaine from what God prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, though hee have never ſo much both power, provocation,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:27208:206"/>
and opportunity to doe it. Wee ought ſo to feare God, as not to provoke him, ſo to love God as not to offend him, and ſo to acknowledge our abſolute dependance upon him, as not to croſſe him. Hee knowes not neither how much hee owes to God, nor yet how obnoxious hee ſtands unto him, that doth not ſo farre ſubmit himſelfe unto him.</p>
            <p>Wee noted the like yeelding to God in <hi>Abimelech</hi> before, what though he doth not now appeare to us in dreames and viſions, <hi>Yet have wee a more ſure word of Prophecy, to whom wee ſhould doe well to take heed:</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> adviſeth us.</p>
            <p>And this is all the good I have noted in <hi>Laban.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us make ſome uſe of this to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what ſhall a man thinke of himſelfe if hee bee not found equall to <hi>Laban</hi> in goodneſſe? Nay, if the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vices bee apparent in him, to thoſe vertues which were in ſo meane a man, I meane in goodneſſe. And yet ſo it is, that many who terme themſelves brethren and Chriſtians, are farre ſhort of <hi>Laban</hi> in theſe ſhewes of vertues. <hi>Laban</hi> was curteous, they are churliſh. <hi>Laban</hi> entertained <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant well, niggardlineſſe will ſcarce ſuffer them to entertaine any well. Hee found <hi>Laban</hi> ready to gratifie him and diſmiſſe him, they doe neither; many care not for kindred or any the like bonds, many care not how they ſerve themſelves of others labours, ſpecially ſervants, and every way are farre worſe matters than <hi>Laban.</hi> No bounty, no juſtice, no ſhew of ſeeing God in things. No ſhew of peaceableneſſe, no regard of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting them any thing, but what they will doe, they will doe, though the God of heaven himſelfe forbid them, and though they know as much.</p>
            <p>Hee is very unlikely to bee of the ſeed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that hath not come ſo farre as <hi>Laban.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, there is little cauſe that a man ſhould applaud himſelfe in ſo ſhort and defective a goodneſſe as this of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> yet this is all that ſome have to pleaſe themſelves and to glory in. They deale curteouſly with their kindred, they bee willing to ſhew kindneſſe to their neighbours. They love well their children, and can give good hoſpitality to ſuch friends as come about them. And they deſire to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with their neighbours, and are ready to compoſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and ſome things they are willing to leave or forbeare that God forbids.</p>
            <p>Alas, theſe be poore evidences for heaven, theſe are poore proofes of their being good men, and in Gods favour. A man muſt not thinke that ſuch a meaſure of goodneſſe will prove him a good Chriſtian, that may ſhew well enough a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heathen. I pray you therefore that all theſe things may
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:27208:206"/>
bee found in you in a better manner, and a larger meaſure, upon better grounds, for better ends, more conſtantly, and more ſincerely. Bee curteous, bountifull, and peaceable, and ſo in the reſt with reference to God, in obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, in love to him, and with a deſire to pleaſe him, and abſtaine from all that hee forbids, and let your peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe and curteſie extend it ſelfe even to enemies.</p>
            <p>That vertue is but a ſeeming vertue which doth not ſpring from a roote of piety, and is not watered with an heavenly dew, and made to grow up with godly conſiderations taken from the divine Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt walke with God, live to him, ſeeke him, pleaſe him, or elſe ſome bare naked good deeds will not ſuffice to prove us his children and his heires.</p>
            <p>So much for the good of <hi>Laban;</hi>
               <note place="margin">His faults.</note> now his evill muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved too.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to God-ward,<note place="margin">1. He was an Idolater.</note> though hee had <hi>Iacob</hi> living in his houſe, and had obſerved by experience, that God did bleſſe him for his ſake, yet hee would not leave his falſe gods, his Idols, his Teraphim, but keepe them ſtill, and made ſuch ſtore of them, that hee tooke it very ill that <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhould ſteale them away, as hee conceived hee had done, though falſly, and therefore alſo hee ſware by the gods of Nahor, and the gods of their Fathers.</p>
            <p>Hee was brought up an Idolater, and continued an Idolater, living and dying in the worſhip of falſe and imaginary gods; which they that doe, ſhall not inherite the kingdome of God, hee had Images of theſe falſe gods, Images of men it may ſeeme they were by their name.</p>
            <p>O how naturall it is to man to erre in the conceit of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of gods, and in ſetting up pictures, and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God to himſelfe? Great darkneſſe poſſeſſeth the mindes of men in the matter of Gods nature, hee will take upon truſt any fable in this kinde, and will ſcarce uſe his own reaſon to examine religion, but for the worſhipping God in an Image, though it bee a point of the greateſt foppery in the world, hee will count it ſingular wiſdome, and count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo much devouter, by how much hee is liker the blocke or picture before which hee doth his falſe devotions.</p>
            <p>Let us bleſſe God that hath delivered us from conceit of fantaſticall gods, and from the love and liking of Images and pictures, which the Lord may ſeeme to have in deteſtation; becauſe in likelihood they were occaſions of inducing the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable opinion of multitude of gods into the world. And let us pray to God to bring the poore ignorant perſons (that run after other gods, or elſe dote upon pictures) out of ſuch their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:27208:207"/>
miſerable condition, and to ſet up the truth in ſo great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that men may no longer caſt themſelves headlong by that which themſelves account religion, and the right way to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Laban</hi> dealt very ill with <hi>Iacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. He loved <hi>Iacob</hi> in a worldly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note>Firſt, the love hee bare him was a meere worldly ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting love, hee found hee gate well by him, therefore hee deſired his company. But for <hi>Iacobs</hi> piety and true religion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded him not a jot the better.</p>
            <p>So moſt times, yea, evermore the love of worldlings doth grow from the roote of worldlineſſe.</p>
            <p>If by ſome good <hi>Iacob</hi> they have attained, or hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine profit and advantage, they are loath to part with him; but unleſſe ſuch things doe commend a man to them, hee may ſit without doores long enough, and his goodneſſe with him, before they will take him into houſe.</p>
            <p>Such a carnall love to good men is none other thing than may bee ſeene in as bad a man as hee of whom wee entreate. You muſt therefore learne to love a <hi>Iacob</hi> as a <hi>Iacob,</hi> and in the name of a <hi>Iacob,</hi> that love will demonſtrate ſome piety to your ſelves. And when wee perceive the kindneſſe of any man to have its originall in ſuch baſe ends, wee muſt eſteeme it a point of diſcretion not to truſt at all in their loves, they will ſoone turne enemies for gaine, whom gaine maketh friends.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. He couſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               </note>Further, <hi>Laban</hi> did palpably deceive and couſin <hi>Iacob</hi> in a matter wherein deceit ſhould leaſt of all bee uſed, even in point of Matrimony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iacob</hi> intended to live contentedly with his owne wife, as his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> had done before him, and therefore ſetting his affections on the younger daughter <hi>Rachel,</hi> agrees to ſerve <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> for her ſeven yeares, inſtead of dowrie which hee had not to give. <hi>Laban</hi> agrees to it, as I ſhewed you before, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling his neighbours, celebrates the marriage with a feaſt.</p>
            <p>It muſt not bee doubted, but that they were all made to underſtand which of the maides was the Bride, as well as which young man was the Bridegroome. But at night it may ſeeme the Bride was brought into the Bridegroomes Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vailed for modeſty ſake.</p>
            <p>Laban perſwades his eldeſt daughter <hi>Leah</hi> to poſſeſſe the place of her younger ſiſter, whether with or without her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it is not expreſſed; but moſt likely without, and ſo is <hi>Iacob</hi> in the morning greatly diſcontented, to ſee a ſtranger bedded with him inſtead of his owne Spouſe. Wherefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the wrong to his Father in Law, hee is anſwered with a ſhift, that the cuſtome of that place is not to beſtow the younger before the elder; but if hee would ſerve ſeven
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:27208:207"/>
yeares more for <hi>Rachel,</hi> hee ſhould have her too: for Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy was not then reputed a ſinne. <hi>Iacob</hi> muſt needes bee content with that which hee could not helpe, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to make his apprentiſhip longer by halfe than hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, here was flat couſenage. To winde in <hi>Iacob</hi> for ſeven yeares more than hee meant at firſt, and to beſtow both his daughters upon ſo thriving a man, and ſo advantage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more wayes than one at once; this fellow feares not to breake Covenant, and to beguile and defraud a man in his wife. And when hee was told of it hee pretends a contrary cuſtome; If there were no ſuch cuſtome, hee playes the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fellow, in ſaying wittingly that which was not for the excuſing of his fault: If there were ſuch a cuſtome, hee playes the couſening companion in concealing it before, and not acquainting <hi>Iacob</hi> with it when hee made the motion. He ſhould have ſaid, I would willingly give her thee, but that the cuſtome of the countrey hinders: but if thou wilt have them both, firſt the elder, then the younger; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. This had beene plaine dealing; but to leade <hi>Iacob</hi> on with words, and then at laſt pull him on in this faſhion to ſeven yeares bondage more, was flat diſhoneſty.</p>
            <p>And ſuch is the diſpoſition of a worldling for advantage ſake, that hee cares not with trickes to out-reach and beguile any with whom hee deales; but wee have a better direction from Gods Word, ſaying, <hi>Let none of you defraud or over-reach ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any matter,</hi> for God is an avenger of all that doe ſuch things.</p>
            <p>Hee uſed the like guilefull dealing after, in changing his wages ſo many times, and all proceeded from the ſame evill humour of covetouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>But now ſee another ſinne, whereof <hi>Iacob</hi> makes mention to his Wives in way of perſwading them to depart with him; <hi>Iacob beheld Labans countenance, that it was not to him at before:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Loe, hee lookes doggedly upon him,<note place="margin">4. He looked doggedly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his wealth, though without any wrong.</note> and hath a kinde of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious grudge againſt him: not for any fault of his, but alone becauſe hee hindered his wealth, in that God gave his riches to <hi>Iacob,</hi> by cauſing moſt of the Ewes and ſhee Goates to bring forth ſtill young of ſuch colour as was agreed upon for <hi>Iacobs</hi> wages. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>If hee ſaid the ſpeckled ſhall bee thy wages, all the cattell bare ſpeckled;</hi> and now this cauſed the falling out.</p>
            <p>See here the guiſe of a carnall and earthly minded man, hee will become an enemy and beare a grudge to any that hinders him in his gaine, though it bee without any wrong or injuſtice.</p>
            <p>It was not any injury, though it were a damage to <hi>Laban,</hi> that ſtill the greater number, and better cattell were <hi>Iacobs,</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:27208:208"/>
but becauſe hee ſees it ſo, therefore hee beares an ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Iacob;</hi> as <hi>Saul</hi> hated <hi>David</hi> becauſe hee ſaw that God had intended to turne the kingdome unto him.</p>
            <p>Nature will ſhew that this is a fault: for why ſhould I hate a man becauſe God proſpers him? but deſire of gain will ſo blinde the eyes, that hee which is led with it, will not avoide this fault, nor will take notice likely that it is a fault: you muſt obſerve it in <hi>Laban,</hi> and informe your ſelves how unreaſonable a thing it is; and the ſonnes of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> too did joyne with him in the ſame fault, for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muttered againſt him in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. He purſued <hi>Iacob</hi> with an hoſtile minde.</note>And now I proceed to his next fault, hee purſued <hi>Iacob</hi> with an hoſtile minde, intending either to bring him backe againe, and then hee muſt have ſerved him on poore and hard termes, or elſe to have ſent him empty enough away, and accordingly provided himſelfe of company, in ſo much that himſelfe ſaith, <hi>It was in his power to have done Iacob hurt;</hi> but that God forbade him, and <hi>Iacob</hi> upbraides him with it.</p>
            <p>Indeed God needed not to have appeared to him for the forbidding of ſuch a thing, if hee had not ſeene what would elſe have beene the iſſue.</p>
            <p>A very great ſinne this was in his purpoſe, though God hindered the execution: wee muſt marke his ſinne, hee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Iacob</hi> in anger, meaning to have ſtript him of all. A wicked thing it is, upon occaſion of ſomething that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth like a fault, to attempt ſuch a buſineſſe; for the worſt that hee could alleadge, was <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſtealing away without giving him warning or leave, and this in <hi>Iacob</hi> was no fault at all, becauſe God commanded him ſo to doe, neither had it beene a fault, though God had not bidden it; for it ſeemes their agreement was but from yeare to yeare, or for a leſſe ſpace of time, in that <hi>Laban</hi> changed the wages ſo oft, and therefore the time prefixed being fulfilled, <hi>Iacob</hi> was at his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and might goe without asking his leave, or making him privy to his purpoſe. But <hi>Laban</hi> is glad to have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſuch a pretence, and reſolves. Is hee gone without my liking and knowledge? Well, I will teach him better manners towards his Maſter and Father in Law; I will fetch him backe with a witneſſe: and ſo ſtrengthening himſelfe with company, hee makes after him with a revengefull meaning, and overtaking him begins to quarrell, chargeth him to have done fooliſhly in conveighing himſelfe away, with his two daughters, and their children ſo privately. This is a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to intend to hurt a man, to ſpoile him of his eſtate, and to ſend him empty away, taking the advantage of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:27208:208"/>
by him done, which may ſeeme to have beene done ſomewhat indiſcreetly and faultily, onely or chiefly out of envy and covetouſneſſe to get ones goods, and to bee revenged of him. No man is ſo blinde but hee would blame this in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and therefore muſt needs ſinne againſt his knowledge, if he doe it himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The laſt fault of <hi>Laban</hi> is,<note place="margin">6. He falſely chargeth <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> with ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Idols.</note> that hee falſly chargeth <hi>Iacob</hi> with ſtealing his Idols, and meerely upon ſurmiſes; they were gone at that time when <hi>Iacob</hi> went, and therefore his concluſion was, <hi>Iacob</hi> muſt needes have them; yea, hee was ſo peremptory, that <hi>Iacobs</hi> deniall would not ſatisfie, though hee denied ſo ſtrongly, as to offer the offender to death if hee could finde them: but hee rifles and ſearcheth all his goods for them, imagining perhaps that ſome body elſe might have ſtollen them without <hi>Iacobs</hi> privity, which was true indeed. But here by the way, I muſt taxe <hi>Iacob</hi> for a little too much confidence in his offer, had <hi>Laban</hi> found the Idols, hee would not have conſented to the death of <hi>Rachel,</hi> nor to the taking of her from him.</p>
            <p>It is good to bee moderate in our ſpeeches, and not over-confident; but <hi>Laban</hi> is the ſubject of our ſpeech now: hee did falſly charge <hi>Iacob</hi> with theft, upon a ſurmiſe of his owne.</p>
            <p>This is a ſinne which no man can brooke from another, without blaming him for it, therefore hee hath light enough if hee could uſe the light to diſcover it in himſelfe. Too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to beleeve, and too earneſtly to affirme againſt another, that hee hath committed ſuch a ſinne, becauſe wee have ſome probabilities to alleadge againſt him, is a ſinne againſt our brother, and an injurious defiling of his name, againſt whom wee ought not to raiſe up an ill report: Neither without juſt or ſure proofe, nor yet in publike manner, as <hi>Laban</hi> did, if wee might reforme it privately.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Laban</hi> failed both in the manner and manner of his accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the matter, it was falſe; the manner, it was over-publike, when it ſhould and might have beene private, though it had beene true.</p>
            <p>Now I pray you let us ſearch our ſelves, to ſee if wee bee not guilty of the ſame faults with <hi>Laban,</hi> and learne with griefe and ſhame to confeſſe, that our ſelves who have farre more and better meanes, have yet beene as palpably faulty as this Idolater, as unjuſt, as worldly, as envious, as apt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſurmiſes, and ſo in the reſt; and let us greatly abhorre our ſelves, that better helpes have prevailed no more with us; and now let us reſolve to put away theſe faults: and ſeeing we have given our names to Chriſt, and enjoy the Word, Name, and Sacraments of Chriſt, let us abhorre to runne into thoſe

They would ſeeme to be hindered from granting the ſuit by religion; They were circumciſed, of the true religion, a religion ſleighted and neglected in Canaan, and it was not a ſafe thing in conſcience, and would be a reproach to them to make marriages with perſons uncircumciſed, but if they would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their religion, and teſtifie it by being circumciſed, then they would willingly condeſcend; Now all this talke of circumciſion tended but to bring the Sichemites to ſuch a caſe, that they might the better accompliſh revenge.</p>
            <p>O miſerable fault, to cover hatred with deceitfull words, <hi>A Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheard covered with ſilver droſſe.</hi> To ſpeake one thing and meane the contrary, to pretend a good purpoſe to cover a bad, and the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to effect it by covering.</p>
            <p>Here was a mixture of impiety,<note place="margin">
                  <p>Deceit is a great ſin.</p>
                  <p>Prov. 6.10 18. &amp; 26.26.</p>
               </note> in making religion a cloake to revenge, and of fraud in harbouring and intending, and yet diſguizing revenge.</p>
            <p>So dealt <hi>Abſalom</hi> with his Father <hi>David,</hi> and the ſhame of ſuch ſhall breake forth in the Congregation, hee is a foole, though hee thinkes himſelfe wiſe.</p>
            <p>Now I beſeech you take heed of deceit and guile, the deceitfull ſhall not live out halfe his dayes. To hate, and yet diſſemble with his lips, laying up deceit within him, is a loathſome thing. It is a part of the deſcription of an unſanctified man,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> 
               <hi>With their tongues they have uſed deceit;</hi> Nature teacheth men to blame this ſin in others, therefore nature gives light enough to diſcover it in ones ſelfe. Shame it therefore, and hate it: It is bad to have uſed this fraud for covetouſneſſe or ambition ſake, to get wealth or honour, by over-reaching others; but it is worſt of all when it is joyned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and with bloodineſſe, that a man make himſelfe a bloody and deceitfull man. It is naught when only good will is pretended, but when religion is made the cloake of cruelty and villany, this is to abuſe the nobleſt thing in the world, by making it a drudge to the baſeſt.</p>
            <p>Now if any of your conſciences be guilty of abuſing pretences of religion for the compaſſing of revenge, of goods, of luſt, of any other villanous end, he hath ſinned the ſin of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſons. Let him be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to repent, and let us all be induced to abhor ſo great a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; he that doth compaſſe any unlawfull end by deceit, makes the ſin twice as grievous as elſe it would be: He ſhews that he commits it with almoſt a full conſent of will, he makes his reaſon a ſlave to his appetite, and ſerves ſin willingly, moſt willingly and deliberately.</p>
            <p>Let us love true, plaine, and juſt dealing, and abhorre couſenage and falſhood.</p>

            <p>O how vile a ſinne is this revenge! one had done them wrong, they revenge it upon a whole City: one had injuried them in one ſiſter, they wrong a number in many ſiſters and goods beſides: here is injuſtice and malice both in a very high degree. They are ſaid to have beene grieved but with a carnall griefe, and to have beene wroth, but with a carnall wrath, for the folly committed by <hi>Shechem,</hi> and that it was a carnall wrath is manifeſt; for loe, it makes them ſeeke to revenge themſelves by a moſt exceſſive and a moſt unjuſt courſe.</p>
            <p>I call upon you to crucifie this humour of revenge, it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blamed: <hi>Avenge not your ſelves, but give place unto wrath; Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence not evill for evill: Be not overcome of evill.</hi> Returne not evill to him that hath done thee evill; if any thing may diſgrace private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, this example may; for you ſee, when men thinke good to take upon them to revenge their owne quarrels, they know not how to obſerve any equality or moderation.</p>
            <p>And now I require you all, as you will prove your ſelves true Chriſtians, and ever have the comfort of being Chriſts ſheepe, follow him in not revenging wrongs, for hee gave you an example: S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, of this vertue, when hee did not render reviling for reviling, nor threatening words neither, for evill deedes. If you harbour revenge, you forgive not, and if you will not forgive, you ſhall not be forgiven.</p>
            <p>Morall Philoſophy teacheth us not to wrong or hurt another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked, but it tolerates it when wee are provoked by wrongs; but the perfection of Chriſtian religion is this, that it teacheth, and where it is in truth, enableth not alone, not to recompence wrong to a wrong doer, but alſo to doe good againſt evill.</p>
            <p>Shunne you this wickedneſſe, and follow not the wickedneſſe of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes, but take heed of wronging any in their goods, for revenge ſake.</p>

            <p>Inceſt is a great ſinne, it defileth the Fathers bed, it is a wrong to himſelfe and the party with whom hee offendeth as any ſinne in that kinde, and it is much againſt nature ſhewing a moſt violent and brutiſh rage of luſt, treading downe all conſiderations even of the lawes and rules of nature it ſelfe, in diſcovering the Fathers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> and wronging ſo deare a perſon in ſo high a degree, and in a thing ſo neere unto him. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of it as of a thing not ſo much as named among the Heathen, and was greatly grieved that it was committed and not duely puniſhed among the <hi>Corinths. Abſalom</hi> committed it with an high hand and extreame wilfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and preſumption, even upon ten of his Fathers Concubines one after another, and that openly and of purpoſe to vexe his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and make the jarre betwixt them irreconcileable, the law plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbad it.</p>
            <p>Now how comes it to paſſe that men run into ſuch groſſe ſins?</p>
            <p>Anſwer, Firſt, God pleaſeth to leave men unto themſelves and permit their breaking forth into ſuch horrible crimes, to make the wickedneſſe of mans heart knowne, to humble the offendours and make way for the demonſtration of his mercy, or elſe to ſhew his juſtice in puniſhing one ſinne with another, and in puniſhing all at laſt with much ſeverity, and to warne others by the example of the offenders, and therefore this Gods permiſſion is not to be blamed or murmured at: for he is ready to forgive ſuch enormous evills to the penitent, as he did alſo pardon <hi>Reuben.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, the Divell out of the filthineſſe of his owne nature and his moſt outragious wickedneſſe and deadly hatred of God and man, is ready to thruſt men out even into ſuch abhominations, becauſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the offence the more it diſhonours God, and hurts the ſoule, name, and all of the offenders, which he delighteth in, and he hopes by one bad example to draw others to the like evill, and ſo to doe more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe to mankinde.</p>
            <p>And for man, his corruptions are very ſtrong, and there is little or no feare of God before his eyes, wherefore by degrees he will waxe extreamely wicked, and runne into crimes againſt the very light of nature: for when any thing begins to corrupt it doth grow worſe and worſe, till it come to extremity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a kinde of eaſie motion to goe from bad to worſe, and eſpecially it is ſo in this corruption of the ſoule, becauſe every ſinne addes blindneſſe and hardneſſe to the minde and heart, and ſo cauſeth the ſinnes to ſeeme farre leſſe vile and miſchievous then they be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all ſinnes doe flatter with a kinde of carnall and ſenſuall content, and ſo carry away the fancie and paſſions, and by them alſo the will to give conſent and to act the wickedeſt things.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt learne firſt to ſee our vile nature and to feare and looke to our ſelves, ſtriving againſt leſſe ſinnes, that we may not be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

over to greater through Gods juſtice and the ſtrength of our luſts, yea to repent of leſſer ſinnes and ſtrive to get them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and healed, and to cry earneſtly to God that he would keepe us, ſeeing alas wee be ſorry and ſimple keepers of our ſelves, thus we may eſcape groſſer evills: we muſt not therfore bragge, and cenſure, and preſume, but know our owne nature, pittie others and heedfully watch over our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Againe, we are to be greatly thankfull to God for keeping us from ſuch notorious vices, for ſuch is his goodneſſe that he reſtraines the greater number from ſuch crimes, becauſe he will not have humane ſocieties too much diſordered and polluted, to haſten his vengeance on the world, this reſtraint is a favour deſerving thankes. O how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hath God in the time of our unregeneracie held us off from moſt foule evills that wee would have committed. Let us mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie God therefore and not lift up our ſelves for ſuch preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And if any have committed ſuch vile ſinnes, let them be much humbled and make haſt to repent, knowing the goodneſſe of God who if we caſt downe our ſelves, is ready to pardon ſuch ſinnes and ſinners. Be not hardened, grow not impudent in ſinning, neither ſeeke to extenuate great ſinnes, but labour to be greatly aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, ſorrowfull for them, and earneſtly ſue for grace to heale your natures, and willingly confeſſe them before God, if they breake out ſo as to proove ſcandalous before men alſo.</p>
            <p>Now ſee <hi>Reubens</hi> particular good deeds.<note place="margin">2. His vertues. 1. He wiſely diſſwaded his Brethren from killing of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, he turned his Brethren from their purpoſe of killing <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> not by earneſt oppoſition which would rather have exaſperated them and haſtened the execution of their evill plot, but by a kinde of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall diſcreet and gentle way diſſwading from the unnaturall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſeeing hee was their Brother and propounding a way leſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall in it ſelfe to ſeeme too, and yet not leſſe fit for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>kill him not with your hands, but caſt him into a pit and let him ſtarve there.</hi> His meaning was not to let him periſh, but he knew that hee could not by force take him out of their hands now, yet he had good hope ſecretly and in their abſence to pull him out of the pit and deliver him ſafe to his Father.</p>
            <p>You ſee here reſpect to his Brother mixed with tender love to his Father alſo, whoſe affection to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> hee well knew and could not but foreſee that which fell out after, how moſt heavily and indeed over-heavily he would take the loſſe of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> So a good Brother ſhould pittie his Brother, being a man fit to be pittied and ſave him from wrong. A good ſonne ſhould pitty his Father and Parents, and ſtrive to prevent the things that will be grievous to them. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the more any man hath once ſinned againſt his Parent as <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi> had, the more carefull hee ſhould be as it were to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for his former wickedneſſe, by ſeeking to doe them good the more afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:27208:219"/>And in oppoſing our ſelves to evill counſell and deeds, we ſhould learne of <hi>Reuben</hi> to uſe wiſedome and prudence, and when wee want power to doe a good thing openly, directly and by ſtrong hand, then to doe it artificially and indirectly and under hand, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding to the contrivers of ſuch counſell ſome other way leſſe evill, which wee may be able to croſſe more eaſily. It is not a fault to ſeeme to yeeld to ſome ſmaller fault with a purpoſe and reſolution of preventing the whole matter, by making a ſhew of yeeldance to ſome degree or part of it, and here you ſee ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evill is not to be diſliked, as <hi>Salomon</hi> alſo ſeemed to intend the dividing of the living childe, for the finding out of the true Mother. When for a little ſpace a man onely ſeemes to allow a fault, that ſhortly after hee may the better manifeſt his diſlike by effecting ſome good, this is not to doe evill that good may come of it, but to doe good in a prudent manner. Let us take care to hinder other mens faults and to doe it wiſely, that over-earneſtneſſe may not hinder our ſucceſſe.<note place="margin">2. He was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded to reſtore <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to his Father againe.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, as he ſought to prevent his death and hurt, ſo was he fully minded to reſtore him to his Father againe.</p>
            <p>So we muſt intend and ſeeke out fit meanes of bringing our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about to do good unto thoſe men whom we ſo cauſeleſly purſued by ill men and to ſet them in ſafety and proſperity; eſpecially to thoſe that are neere unto us, and when wee may bring comfort alſo to others by procuring the ſafety of ſuch as are deare to them, as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> after would have beene a bond-man to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in <hi>Benjamins</hi> ſtead, that he might ſend him home in ſafety which would have beene leſſe to his Fathers griefe, becauſe he was more able to looſe <hi>Iudah</hi> then <hi>Benjamin.</hi> When ſuch caſes fall out, we muſt take fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of doing good.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3 He grieved to ſee his hopes diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> taken out of the pit.</note>Laſtly, it grieved <hi>Reuben</hi> exceedingly when he found his hopes diſappointed and ſaw <hi>Ioſeph</hi> taken out of the pit, for then though he did not know what they had done with him, yet he conjectured that it was not for good that they had remooved him, and therfore he rends his cloathes, ſaying in a dolefull complaint, <hi>the Lad is not yonder, and I whither ſhall I goe?</hi> He could not thinke I ſuppoſe of incurring his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers anger for not preſerving <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> for he might well enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the matter ſhould never come to his Fathers knowledge, but ſorrow for his former fault by which he had grieved him very much, made him exceedingly heavie, that now a new croſſe ſhould fall out to poore <hi>Iacob,</hi> which he knew would cruſh him much more then his fault had done. So that conſciouſneſſe and penitent ſorrow for his former evill, made him much more loving now to his Father, much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to prevent his griefe, and much more diſcontented and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when he found himſelfe prevented of the thing he deſired.</p>
            <p>All men muſt learne to be grieved if any occaſion fall out againſt their wills and knowledge, by which they be hindred from doing ſuch good as they intended. Indeed it can hardly be thought, that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:27208:219"/>
one did ſeriouſly purpoſe to croſſe an evill plot, if the thing being of weight, he be not ſeriouſly troubled, that he is diſabled from croſſing it.</p>
            <p>But the matter which I would moſt commend to the imitation of children is this: The more they have by their offences grieved their Parents already, the more carefull they muſt bee to ſhew their love and reſpect unto them afterwards by all meanes, and to take heavily thoſe things which they know will grieve them. But moſt wicked and impenitent and graceleſſe muſt they be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that ſtill adde wrong to wrong, and perſiſt in a continuall courſe of vexing and tormenting their Parents hearts by their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours, breaking forth ſtill more and more.</p>
            <p>Further <hi>Reuben</hi> did a good worke when hee ſought to remoove his Father from his ſtiffeneſſe in reſolving not to ſend <hi>Benjamin</hi> to <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4 He ſought to remove his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his ſtiffenes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to ſend <hi>Benjamin</hi> into Aegypt.</note> and if it were poſſible to winne him to that which was ſo behoovefull for them all; yea and doing it with much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe too, ſaying, <hi>Slay my Sonnes if I bring him not to thee againe;</hi> hee did not meane to expoſe his Sonnes to the danger of death by his Fathers and their Grand-fathers hand; for hee knew him to bee a farre more loving Grand-father, then that hee could finde in his heart to take ſuch a fruitleſſe and boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe revenge, but his meaning is to deale moſt effectually with his Father, to perſwade him to a needefull thing and diſſwade him from an harmefull peremptorineſſe, as much as if hee had told him, that hee would uſe as much care and diligence for <hi>Benjamins</hi> preſervation, as if the life of his two ſons did lye at ſtake for him.</p>
            <p>It is a good thing even very vehemently to ſtrive to remoove our friends from ill and unreaſonable reſolutions, and this may well bee done even to Parents and Governours, ſo that ſtill wee obſerve ſuch a manner as may not diſcover any diſ-regarding or ſleighting of them. Let no man therefore abſtaine from doing ſuch a good office to his Governour though it ſeeme not ſo pleaſing for the time, for at the laſt it ſhall ſo commend it ſelfe to him that finds the benefit of it, as that diſlike will bee turned into favour, onely ſo that an over-rough manner of doing doe not adde to the bitterneſſe of the thing, as it did in <hi>Ioab</hi> when he perſwaded <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to go out and ſpeak unto his ſervants.</p>
            <p>And let not Governours bee offended with their Inferiours for taking upon them ſo farre. It is no tranſgreſſion of duty, even ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſtrive to diſſwade or perſwade a Ruler in ſuch things. It is weakeneſſe enough in a Governour on ſuch an occaſion to ſay, nay, but to chafe and bee angry is a double fault, wee finde noe ſuch diſtemper in <hi>Iacob.</hi> This is the good of <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His afflictions, ſo farre as is recorded, were not many,<note place="margin">His croſſes. His Father minded him of his inceſt on his death-bed.</note> indeed none but what was common with his other Bretheren, except we
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:27208:220"/>
may count that a croſſe, that hee was ſuffred to ſinne ſo farre, and doubtleſſe it was a corraſive to him all his dayes after, and that his fore-mentioned griefe, as it was in ſome ſence an act of vertue, ſo it was a ſuffering of evill. For to be grieved for ſome miſery like to befall our friends is a great miſery to him that ſo grieveth.</p>
            <p>But one croſſe hee had, that his Father did minde him of his fault on his death-bed before all his bretheren, and did then and there diſ-inherit him, he tooke it well, and made no angry reply.</p>
            <p>It is an affliction to bee diſ-inherited or otherwiſe deprived of any benefit which elſe wee ſhould have had; becauſe of our ſinnes: And wee muſt learne when ſuch a croſſe is laid upon us, to beare it quietly and fruitfully too, I meane ſo as not to breake forth in anger and diſcontent againſt him that doth withdraw ſuch things from us, nor yet to paſſe it over ſleightly and careleſly as not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the hand of God, but to accept it as a juſt puniſhment of our faults, and make it a meanes of renewing and increaſing our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. His benefits hee had divers ſons.</note>Of the benefits of <hi>Reuben</hi> beſides the common, we read of his fruitfullneſſe, for hee had divers ſonnes when they went downe to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ſo hee made one of the twelve Tribes. Wee have noted this mercy afore in others; let us take heed that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſſe of this mercy make us not diſvalew it. A benefit is no whit leſſe to be eſteemed, becauſe the Lord vouchſafeth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to many, and it is nothing but our folly that takes occaſion to ſleight ſuch favours.</p>

Iacob</hi> doth curſe their rage and anger, and doth abominate the ſame.</p>
            <p>It is a grievous ſinne to kill men in a wrathfull paſſion, without juſt warrant and calling from God, indeed to kill one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon is ſinne enough, and calleth for the Sword of the Magiſtrate to cut of the ſinner, how much more to fill ones hands with bloud, and kill as here a whole city or towne.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Murder is a great ſinne.</note>Murder is a ſinne againſt the light of Scripture and of Nature, againſt the Lawes of GOD and every well ordered Common-weale, a groſſe ſinne and palpable, a miſchievous ſinne, wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſon murdered in his life, the pretiouſeſt thing hee hath, with an irrecoverable wrong, wronging his Friends, wronging the Common-weale, and wronging GOD extreamely in preſumptuous incroching upon his prerogative, to be the taker as hee hath beene the giver of life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:27208:220"/>O be thankfull to the living God, that hee hath kept you from this red and crimſon ſinne, eſpecially if any have beene ſo inflamed with rage as once <hi>David,</hi> that he hath even deſired, and reſolved, and intended, and attempted to commit murder, as it fell out to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and he hath kept him from it, either by preventing the occaſion, or ſome counſell comming betwixt, or ſome diverting of the blow or the like, O let him be thankfull that he hath eſcaped the fact of murder, as well as be humble, that he hath deſired to commit the fault. Wee muſt not aſcribe to our ſelves the immunity from groſſe ſinnes, and pleaſe our ſelves in our eſtate becauſe of it, but we muſt give God the glory, and loath and abaſe our ſelves and our bad nature, that ſhould fall into them if wee were left to our ſelves, chiefely if nothing have ſtopped us from them but want of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
            <p>And now ever mortifie anger and wrath, and revengefull boyling of heart, for he that nouriſheth wrath, malice, envie in his ſpirit within, ſhall at laſt be carried away ſo farre with that inward diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that if occaſion offer it ſelfe, he ſhall flame forth into the groſſe act of murder. All corruptions being fed in the heart within, doe gather ſuch ſtrength, that if there be fitneſſe of occaſion they will breake out indeed: O bring not your ſelves into ſuch a temper, that the Divell ſhall have you in readineſſe to make murderers of, if ever hee can fit you with time and place and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>Beware of blouds, beware of blouds, this ſinne teares the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in an hundred peeces when once it is made ſenſible. This ſinne leaves a deepe ſtaine, it begets grievous horrors, and makes the ſoule ſtill fierce in pronouncing evill againſt it, after it hath beene fierce in doing ſo great an evill unto others. Pray to God to preſerve you from it, and get meeke, gentle, quiet, patient ſpirits, which may keepe you from being provoked with wrongs.</p>
            <p>And if any of you have tranſgreſſed in this kinde, though not in ſo high a degree, let the example of theſe two incourage him to repent, and make him flie to the throne of grace, that God would worke in him true repentance, and both pardon and heale him. You ſee two young men here drowned in a river of bloud, moſt innocent bloud, by them moſt cauſeleſly and groundleſly ſpilt, you ſee them yet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Nay they were ſtained with their brothers bloud, whom they conſented to kill, and actually ſould for a ſlave, and yet they be pardoned. Runne to God, hee can pardon many murders as well as one angry word, and will doe it if you ſubmit and convert. He that judgeth himſelfe for his ſinnes paſt, reſolving thoroughly by Gods helpe to reforme his heart and life, and takes boldneſſe to aske remiſſion and ſanctification at Gods hand in Chriſts name, ſhall be pardoned, although the guilt of the bloud of God the ſon did ſticke to his fingers.</p>
            <p>But another fault they committed, when their Father in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:27208:221"/>
of his ſoule and his great feares told them of their fault and their danger,<note place="margin">2. They ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no repen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance when their Father told them of their fault.</note> they ſhewed no repentance, no feare at all either of God or men, but returned him a ſurly kinde of fooliſh excuſe, ſaying, <hi>ſhould he abuſe our ſiſter as a whore.</hi> If you frame this anſwer into a due forme of reaſoning, and apply it to the juſtifying of their murder, for to that purpoſe they alledged it, it muſt runne thus. If any man wrong us notoriouſly wee may and will kill him, and there is no cauſe of reprehending us, but hee hath done ſo, for he hath abuſed our ſiſter as an whore, wherefore we doe not deſerve to be reprooved for killing them. Firſt if they had ſlaine onely the raviſher, it might ſeeme to have beene juſtified by this reaſon had it beene good, but <hi>Hamor</hi> and the other Citizens knew nothing of this abuſe, at leaſt they were not guilty of it, none of them had abuſed their ſiſter. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, who ever made this law, that a man greatly wronged ſhould kill him from whom he had received wrong; ſo their reaſon is naught, and if it were good, yet would it not reach farre enough to juſtifie their deedes.</p>
            <p>Here we have two faults, to anſwer their Father ſurlily, and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently juſtifying the fault in a kinde of angry muttering at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe; this is a common fault amongſt inferiours, if they be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, they goe away grumbling ſome ſorry excuſes or other being angry within, and ſhewing it as farre as well they dare by mumbling out ſome fond words, ſo as they cannot be diſtinctly heard. This is a kinde of replying to Governours and is a ſinne, ſhewing that there is no ſparke of true repentance for the fault, at leaſt that then that ſparke is even raked up. But if after the heate of paſſion that carried one to commit the fault, a man be told mildly of his fault, and then mumble out ſuch fooliſh excuſes, ſure he is not penitent, and in very deede ſuch mutterers would have their mouthes ſtopped and ſtomacke taken downe with ſmart and blowes. This ſhewes a ſleighting of the Governour as well as not repenting of the fault, I pray you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours now you are quiet, conſider how undecent a thing it is, and how ill beſeeming your places? that you may blame it in your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and condemne it for the future, and ſeeke to get it pardoned. And now learne to doe better, give ſuch an anſwer as theſe young youthes ſhould have done but did not, that is, confeſſe your offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, humble your ſelves, reſolve upon, and unfaignedly promiſe amendment, and pacifie the anger at once of God, your Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and your owne conſciences.</p>
            <p>And ſee in them a ſecond fault in this one anſwer, a bearing out of themſelves in their ſinnes without feare, ſhame or remorſe, and that upon ſo fond a pretext as this, that they had received a wrong firſt. To continue heardned in a ſinne, ſuch a ſinne, not to be able to ſee the hatefulneſſe of it, not to feele the weightineſſe of it, not to feare the juſt judgements of God and due puniſhments of men, but in ſteede of ſorrow to ſhew ſtiffeneſſe, as much as to ſay, if it were to doe againe I would doe it, and I am not ſorry that I have done it, this
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:27208:221"/>
is a great badneſſe, and to beare ones ſelfe thus in ſinne upon meere falſe conceits, that have no probability of truth in them, argues a moſt blinde minde and a ſtupid conſcience, and makes the ſinne much more offenſive to God, as ſhewing that the mind is not carried to ſinne on a ſuddaine temptation, but gives it ſelfe to ſinne out of the place it hath given to the beleefe of falſe principles, as theſe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with themſelves, that it was reaſon to kill him that abuſed their ſiſter, and therefore deliberately had reſolved to doe it. Let us take heede to our ſelves, that we be not thus hardened by the deceitfulnes of ſinning.</p>
            <p>Now the puniſhment of this ſinne is this,<note place="margin">
                  <p>Their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>They loſt part of the birth-right.</p>
               </note> that they were minded of it by <hi>Iacob,</hi> and had not that part of the birth-right ſetled upon them though the next in age that <hi>Reuben</hi> had forfeited, but were ſcattered and divided in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and made to be two of the ſmalleſt and meaneſt tribes, not fit either to command and rule, or elſe to have the double portion, becauſe of their ſmall number. God did afterward turne this to <hi>Levi</hi> to a bleſſing, but in it ſelfe it was a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God cauſeth that for murder and ſuch inſolencies toward the Father, the whole poſterity after them doth fare the worſe in earthly things for their fault, and juſt it is that he ſhould doe ſo, for hee lookes upon Parent and childeren, as upon roote and branch, making but one common bodie where each is a part, and therefore in ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the roote doth bring miſery upon the branches too, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. O let us take up this argument to fortifie our reſolutions againſt ſinne, ſhunne earneſtly the doing of thoſe evils which may provoke God to ſcatter and diſperſe thine ofspring after thee.</p>

            <p>Now of <hi>Iudah</hi> in ſeverall, conſider his faults and vertues,<note place="margin">Iudah.</note> benefits and croſſes.</p>
            <p>His faults were theſe beſides what was common in the matter of of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and the reſt. Firſt,<note place="margin">His faults, 1. He left his Fathers houſe.</note> that he ſeperated himſelfe from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, and went and lived with a certaine <hi>Cananite</hi> called an <hi>Adullamite,</hi> becauſe he lived neere a place called <hi>Adullam,</hi> and out of I know not what occaſion, there grew a great and inward friend with him. This was <hi>to get out of Gods bleſsing into the warme ſunne,</hi> to leave the family of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and table with <hi>Hiram,</hi> this was to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelfe out of the Church what in him lay, and to bid adue to God and all his ſpirituall bleſſings.</p>
            <p>It muſt be noted as a great fault, for any worldly reſpect whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, voluntarily to transplant a mans ſelfe out of the viſible Church into a profane and unhallowed place where the Church is not. There where you have Gods Word, Gods Sacraments, Gods Name and Gods people, and finde your ſelves ſpiritually edified, there abide though it be with ſome inconveniences to your eſtate, and be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling rather to ſuffer outward dammage then inward, ſhew more love
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:27208:222"/>
of goodneſſe then <hi>Iudah</hi> did when he was a prophane young man. After you ſee he returned home to his Fathers houſe, it had beene better not to have departed thence at all.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. He was led by his eye in marriage.</note>A ſecond fault, being there he is led by his eye to marry a <hi>Cananitiſh</hi> woman. It is likely without conſent or privity of his old Father, it is ſcarce like he would goe to him to aske counſell, whoſe family he had forſaken.</p>
            <p>Beware young men of erring with <hi>Iudah,</hi> and marrying your ſelves to prophane and idolatrous perſons of your owne heads for ſiniſter reſpects, leaſt the Lord puniſh you as he did <hi>Iudah.</hi> The youth of <hi>Iudah</hi> doth a little excuſe, for he was very young when he had his firſt childe, as appeares, becauſe his childe by <hi>Tamar viz. Pharez,</hi> had two ſonnes at the time of their going downe to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was but 39. yeares, for he was 30. before the yeares of famine came when he ſtood before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and there had beene 7. yeares of plenty paſt after his preferment and two of famine. Now <hi>Iudah</hi> was <hi>Iacobs</hi> fourth ſonne, borne about the fourth or fifth yeare of his being in <hi>Padan,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the laſt borne there about the 14. yeare, ſo there was ſome 10. yeares ſpace betwixt that, therefore <hi>Ioſeph</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 39. he could be at moſt but 49. <hi>Tamar</hi> by whom he had <hi>Pharez,</hi> was married to two of his ſonnes and ſtaied till the third was marrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that could not be leſſe then ſome 18. or 19 yeares, and <hi>Pharez</hi> could not be thought to have two ſonnes, but that he muſt be ſome 18. or 19. yeares, which make ſome 32. at leaſt, therefore <hi>Iudah</hi> when he married muſt be no more then ſome 18. or 19. yeares. His youth therefore I ſay extenuates his fault, but let none of your ages be ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed with ſuch a fault, as was too blameworthy even in the greene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his youth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. He commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted inceſt with his daughter in law.</note>Thirdly he ſinned in committing as he thought whoredome with a profeſſed harlot, but it was indeede inceſt with his daughter in law, who of purpoſe lay to intice him in the habit of a harlot, by the way where ſhee knew he muſt goe; This is a filthineſſe, that a man ſhould ſuffer himſelfe to be ſo farre inſlaved to luſt after a disguiſed harlot by the way, as to ſolicit her, and hire her, and abuſe her. He was at that time a widdower, and the time of mourning for his wife was paſt, and now he made no great conſcience of ſingle whoredome, but <hi>God will judge whoremongers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb 13 4. 1 Cor. 6.9.</note> 
               <hi>and whoremongers ſhall not inherit Gods kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be any amongſt you as bad as <hi>Iudah,</hi> that makes little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of avoiding whoredome if he may doe it cloſely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge, and hath abuſed his wealth to hire an object for his unlawfull luſt to worke upon, he muſt ſee his fault in <hi>Iudah</hi> and repent of it.</p>
            <p>And you muſt all be exhorted to arme your ſelves with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of flying fornication, and of watching over your ſelves, and ſo carefully reſiſting the firſt motions to evill, that you may not be ſo eaſily drawne away and enticed. And ſuch as God hath made of a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:27208:222"/>
better temper, then that ſuch an object would ſo ſoone intangle them, and hath not intangled them, muſt acknowledge Gods favour in preventing them from ſuch evills, and take heed to themſelves that they allow not others as bad, revenge, quarrelling, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, deceit or the like.</p>
            <p>Another fault of <hi>Iudah</hi> was,<note place="margin">4. He diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with his daughter in Law.</note> that he diſſembled with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Law, making her beleeve ſhee ſhould have his ſonne <hi>Shelah,</hi> if ſhee would ſtay a little till hee was growne up, but never meant to performe it, nor did not goe about to accompliſh the marriage when the young man was growne up, which cauſed her to thinke of a ſharpe and lewd revenge, even to draw him to doe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully which his ſonne ſhould have done lawfully, raiſe up ſeed to his brother, a cuſtome which was then in uſe amongſt them I know not on what ground, but it ſeemes to be from God, becauſe he did eſtabliſh it by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law after.</p>
            <p>You muſt learne to take heede of counterfeiting and deceiving, making promiſes alone for ſhifts and delaies which you minde never to performe, but alone to ſerve a preſent turne eſpecially in matters of ſome weight. This is flat lying for to ſpeake otherwiſe then my meaning is, to goe againſt the minde and to utter falſehood of ſet purpoſe, as much as any other made lie can be thought to be, yet nothing more common then this, men for an advantage will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and ſay any thing which they never meane or thinke to make good, how can hee ſay hee is a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in whom there is ſo much guile? How can hee ſay that hee ſpeakes the truth that is in his heart? yee falſe promiſing double tongued men, ſee how you be diſhoneſt and unjuſt, and falſe men, and learne to bewaile and amend this wickedneſſe. Now promiſe nothing but what you fully intend, and know that upon good reaſon you may intend to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and when the promiſe is made, give it ſeaſonable accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment. Wee muſt reade Stories and Scriptures to ſee and amend, not to excuſe the like faults in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhew'd a fault or two more in dealing with <hi>Tamar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. He forgat his owne naughtineſſe, &amp; would have had <hi>Tamar</hi> burnt.</note> when her big belly ſhewed what ſhee had done, hee forgat his owne naughtineſſe and would have had her burnt. What autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he had in that place I know not, whether he had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a member of that towne of <hi>Adullam,</hi> and had gotten to be a Ruler, but ſhee was accordingly brought forth to be burnt, and then ſeeing the ſignes hee could not deny them, and then blames himſelfe, and the ſentence of burning grew cold, becauſe both or neither it ſeemes were to be burnt. But before hee knew his owne guiltineſſe, hee was glad to have an occaſion of being rid of her, that his ſone <hi>Shelah</hi> might ſcape her.</p>
            <p>Loe what raſh cenſurers wee are like to be of other mens faults, and willing to have them puniſhed, in the meane time forgetting our owne as great offences; Let us learne to be more moderate, and to have the wiſedome to looke upon our owne offences before they
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:27208:223"/>
be brought to our mindes by ſuch tokens as made <hi>Iudah</hi> confeſſe his fault.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">6. Repented not of his whoredome, but ſought to redeeme his pledge.</note>Againe, when <hi>Iudah</hi> had committed whoredome, he goes his way never repenting, but all his care is to redeeme his pledge by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the kid, which either was of leſſe worth or at leaſt not ſo apt to bewray him, and when the woman could not be found, and that his friend returned aſhamed to make ſo infamous an inquiry, hee ſaid, <hi>let her take it leaſt wee be laughed at,</hi> ſo the ſinne did not much moove him if he might eſcape the reproach.</p>
            <p>It is thus with moſt men, ſuch a ſleepie conſcience they have within them, that if they beare out the fault with ſecrecy, they be not grieved for it, onely reproach by having the buſineſſe knowne would make them ſtartle and be troubled; O if any be ſo affected, he ſhewes that no feare of God is before his eyes.</p>
            <p>Let us labour at leaſt to have ſo much truth of goodneſſe left in us, that if we ſhould fall into any groſſe ſinne though never ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and without knowledge of it to any, yet we might be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with ſorrow in regard of the offence done to God, and ſo fall downe before him and lament it, and confeſſe it, and repent of it before him, and renew our purpoſes of amendment and ſhe for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and helpe, which till wee have done wee are not recovered out of the ſnare of the Divell, but ſhall be carried into the ſame ſinne againe and againe, ſo often as he can preſent us with occaſions. He that can let ſinne goe lightly away if no naturall evill follow from it, is either deſtitute of all graces or hath his graces much abated and infeebled by the prevailing of corruption.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of <hi>Iudahs</hi> faults, now his particular good deeds.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His vertues. 1. He returned at laſt to his Fathers houſe.</note>Firſt, he returned at laſt to his Fathers houſe, and dwelt there with his Brethren as a member of his Fathers family againe, when hee made his returne I know not, but that hee did it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>If any have departed out of the Church and ſociety of good men, let him learne of <hi>Iudah</hi> to turne backe againe the better way, and to come home to the place where God dwelleth. <hi>David</hi> was grieved, that hee was forcibly driven out of Gods Inheritance, and wiſhed nothing more then that he might have liberty to dwell in Gods Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles. Let us if we have baniſhed our ſelves from ſuch habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be carefull to returne with ſpeed from our voluntary wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. He was ſomewhat humbled for his ſinne.</note>Secondly, <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhewes himſelfe ſomewhat humbled for his ſinne with <hi>Tamar,</hi> for ſeeing the tokens he had left with her, and knowing his fault, hee confeſſeth his fault and ſaith, <hi>ſhee is more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous then I.</hi> For <hi>Shelah</hi> was growne up and was not given unto her.</p>
            <p>So muſt wee doe, if wee have ſinned and beene an occaſion of others ſinnes, let us juſtifie them above our ſelves and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our ſelves more then them, and not bee poſſeſſed ſo with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:27208:223"/>
the partiality of ſelfe-love, as ſtill to ſtand in our owne light, denying the fault or laying the blame upon another. True repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will be ready to blame it ſelfe, but an impenitent heart is witty to caſt the blame ſtill from it ſelfe upon another.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is ſaid, <hi>hee knew</hi> Tamar <hi>no more afterwards,</hi> and wee reade not of any other wife or childe he had afterwards, ſo that he forbare her becauſe ſhee was his daughter in Law, and forbare to take another wife voluntarily, it is like, in humiliation for this unbridled fact he had committed.</p>
            <p>If any have ſinned in unlawfull deeds of this kinde, his care muſt be with <hi>Iudah</hi> to offend ſo no more, and to be ſo humbled with his former offence, that the conſideration of it may make him temper him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the future.</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>Iudah</hi> carried himſelfe well towards his Father,<note place="margin">3. He carried himſelfe well to his Father.</note> for hee was earneſt to get him ſend <hi>Benjamin</hi> with them to the Governour in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at laſt prevailed by interpoſing his faithfull promiſe to bring him backe againe, as you reade in the Story.<note place="margin">Gen. 43.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is a good thing in an Inferiour to turne away his Superiour from ſtiffeneſſe in an indiſcreet purpoſe, and he hath performed a worthy office, that hath ſo farre prevailed with his ſuperiour for the good of himſelfe and of others, wherefore doe this good deed with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe and diſcretion, as occaſion ſerveth.</p>
            <p>The laſt good deed of <hi>Iudah</hi> and moſt commendable,<note place="margin">4. He faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with his Father.</note> was his faithfull keeping of his promiſe with <hi>Iacob,</hi> in offering himſelfe to be a bondſlave in <hi>Benjamins</hi> roome, whoſe abſence he knew would even kill his old Father, ſo that hee was content to take the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of anothers fault upon himſelfe, rather then falſify his word of preſenting the Lad againe unto his Father. How was love and faithfullneſſe joyned both in one act?</p>
            <p>We muſt learne to practiſe even ſo, to love a Parent ſo, as if it be poſſible to prevent his griefe with our owne ſo great a miſery as perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bondage during life.</p>
            <p>How much are they to blame that occaſion their Parents miſery by their wilfull ſinnes, and can well enough be content to ſee their Parents goe mourning to the grave, even for their incorrigible naughtineſſe. Sure the affection of good children is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>And now children, have a loving pittie to your Parents, and frame your ſelves rather to ſuffer any miſery then the ſight of your Parents pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away in griefe, eſpecially then the procuring of it by your owne miſdemeanours.</p>
            <p>Againe, he ſhewed here great fidelity for having given his Word to his Father, that he would bring <hi>Benjamin</hi> againe to him, he preferres the performing of his promiſe before his owne liberty, and would rather keepe his promiſe with his Father then live at home with him in freedome.</p>
            <p>Let us learne to ſhew the like care in keeping our promiſes, even to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:27208:224"/>
doe what wee have ſaid chiefely in matters of weight, though wee cannot doe it without great inconveniences to our ſelves, let us keepe promiſe though it be to our hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. He did cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly beare an evill acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note>Againe, <hi>Iudah</hi> makes a moſt pithy and rhetoricall ſpeech to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> for affection will make a reaſonable wit to doe the office of a good Orator. This was a commendable thing in <hi>Iudah,</hi> to beare ſo ſudden and terrible an accident with ſo much ſtrength of minde, that he could apply himſelfe to take that courſe which was fit and behoofefull, notwithſtanding his griefes.</p>
            <p>Let us labour to be of ſo well compact a ſpirit, that extremity of ſudden blowes may not diſable us from carrying our ſelves diſcreete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly even in ſuch unexpected accidents. This is a gift that we muſt beg at Gods hands, and the beſt way to get it, is as <hi>Iudah</hi> did, to ſee God in it, and be humbled before him for our ſins that procured it. And ſo much for <hi>Iudahs</hi> particular good deeds.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His croſſes. 1. He had two very wicked ſonnes.</note>Now his croſſes were, firſt that he had two ſonnes ſo wicked, that God himſelfe could not brooke them, but even ſlew them for their extreame wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>It is a croſſe that hath befallen many a Father to have very lewd chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; Labour what you can to prevent it by being good your ſelves, and carry not your ſelves ſo wickedly as to pull this croſſe upon your ſelves, as <hi>Iudah</hi> did in running to <hi>Hiram</hi> and marrying a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanitiſh</hi> woman; for what could he looke for but that the ſonnes of ſuch a woman and brought up in ſuch a place ſhould proove wicked? And if it doe befall any of you or have befalne you, be indeed hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by it, but not put quite out of heart. Let it helpe to make your ſelves better if your children be wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His daughter in Law drew him to inceſt when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication onely.</note>Another croſſe was, that his daughter in Lawes diſcontent drew her to proſtitute her ſelfe to him in the diſguize of an Harlot and ſo drew him to inceſt, when he thought but to have committed fornication.</p>
            <p>It is a miſery to be drawne into a more grievous ſinne then one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to commit; Let us reſolve to commit none at all, that ſuch an addition of faultineſſe may not be put upon our ſinnes beyond our owne knowledge, and if it have befalne us, let us learne to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled very much. It is juſt with God to give a man over to a worſe ſinne then he thought of, that is bold to take liberty to commit ſome ſin which he ought not to have done.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. His ſinne brake forth to his ſhame.</note>Laſtly, God did cauſe the ſinne of <hi>Iudah</hi> to breake forth to his ſhame, as you know, though hee feared the ſhame more then the ſinne.</p>
            <p>And this is ſurely a great puniſhment to make ones evills knowne which he hoped ſhould have beene kept ſtill in ſecrecy. And a juſt thing it is with God to diſhonour a man before men, when hee will diſhonour God by ſinning boldly in ſecret.</p>
            <p>And if God have buried any mans faults in darkeneſſe, let him bury them by repentance, elſe they ſhall breake out more reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:27208:224"/>
at laſt day to his utter confuſion. But if God have caſt the dirt of any mans ſin upon his face, and layd his groſſe crimes open to all the world, he muſt make this uſe of it, to be more humbled before God, and improve the griefe that ſhame and reproach will ſtirre in him, to the more hearty bewailing of the ſin that deſerved it, otherwiſe to be greatly grieved, for the ſhame is nothing elſe but a carnall and unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſorrow.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for <hi>Iudahs</hi> croſſes.<note place="margin">His benefits.</note> Now his particular benefits are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he was a man of very good naturall parts,<note place="margin">1. He had very good naturall parts.</note> and it ſeemeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled his bretheren all but <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in theſe naturall abilities as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, becauſe <hi>Iacob</hi> truſted <hi>Benjamin</hi> with him, whom he would not truſt with <hi>Reuben,</hi> and ſent him before to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and it is moſt cleare by his excellently diſcreete and wiſe Oration, that he made to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> on the ſuddaine when they were brought backe againe with the cup.</p>
            <p>To have wit, good ſpeech, good audacity, and other like naturall parts, is a great favour of God. Thoſe that have them not are to ſeeke for ſo much the more grace, that the preſence of the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent may ſupply the want of the meaner. A leſſe wit with more grace doth availe more to happineſſe here in the world then a farre greater wit without grace.</p>
            <p>Againe, thoſe that have theſe good abilities, muſt take heede of marrying themſelves and defiling them by being proud of them and abuſing them, but muſt walke humbly, as knowing that they be but common benefits, ſuch as the wickeddeſt enjoy, and things lent by God for which they muſt anſwer. Therefore they ſhould employ them vertuouſly and for good purpoſes, that ſo they may have the true credit and comfort of them. Ah if theſe be ſanctified, how great a luſtre doe they receive from grace, elſe the Divell hath more of them then any man alive, and yet remaineth a hatefull and a curſed creature.</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>Iudah</hi> had a part of the birth-right ſetled upon him,<note place="margin">2.

            <p>It is a great kindneſſe of God to paſſe by ones unworthineſſe, to give him ſuperiority in bleſſings, though his ſinnes may ſeeme to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the loſſe of them.

               <note place="margin">His faults. 1. Hee looked luſtfully on <hi>Dinah.</hi> Gen. 34.</note>His bad deedes come firſt to be noted, and that was firſt, he gave his eye liberty to wander with a luſtfull wandring. It is ſaid, <hi>hee ſaw Dinah and tooke her,</hi> the Divell and ſinne prevailed againſt him by the diſordered uſe of his ſence. He gave himſelfe leave to gaze over-earneſtly upon her beauty and other good parts, wherewith the eye is uſually taken and the heart inflamed.</p>
            <p>Let us learne to repreſſe an evill and a wanton looke, and to keepe the Divell from poſſeſſing himſelfe of this window as it were of the ſoule, to be maſter of this conveighance, by which ſo much comes in and goes out of the ſoule. The eye muſt be looked to with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, by him that would not be ſurprized with luſt, hee muſt turne away his eye from beholding this vanity, the beauty of a woman: he muſt as <hi>Iob</hi> make a covenant with his eye,<note place="margin">Job. 31.1.</note> that it let not in luſt and wanton deſires, he that mortifieth not as other of his ſenſes ſo this, ſhall never be thoroughly maſter of himſelfe, nor get any notable victory againſt his corruptions. You are not ignorant of our Saviours command,<note place="margin">Mat. 5 29.</note> 
               <hi>to pull out the right eye if it offend.</hi> This is one way of pulling out an eye, to bridle it from looking upon ſuch objects as may ſtirre up luſt and other evill deſires in the heart, and that the eye may be thus bridled, the heart muſt be over-awed with the feare of God, and ſo ſetled in a firme, ſtedfaſt and full reſolution of not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in any kinde or degree, and in an earneſt indeavour to loath and deteſt ſinne, not alone to leave it. Hatred hath ſuch a power over the whole man, that it will not ſuffer the eye without ſome inward riſing to fixe it ſelfe upon the thing hated, or any thing that hath a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that way. Let all good Chriſtians get the heart ſo armed, and the eye will be ſufficiently defended. Here now is his firſt fault, he looked upon a woman to luſt after her, and did not checke the deſire, nor refraine the wandring eye. Take heede of the beginning of his offence, if you would not come to the end of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. He enticed or forced her to naughtines, or both.</note>The next fault is, he either forced or enticed, or as it is likely, partly by perſwaſion and partly by ſome kind of violence brought her into a fit place for his purpoſe, and ſo his luſt made more head-ſtrong by fitneſſe of the opportunity, committed the act of fornication and folly with her, and as it was after ſaid, <hi>wrought folly in Iſrael.</hi> His ſinne was the ſinne of fornication, and it is like enough we may call it a rape, he forced a maiden. I am rather induced to thinke it was done moſt by force, becauſe that the maiden made the thing knowne to her Father, who (had it beene done by her free conſent) ſhould not (it is likely) have come to the knowledge of it by her meanes, nor could by any other, ſo then he forced a maiden. It may well be that by faire and curteous carriage he wan her into a houſe, and then by ſtrength mixed with perſwaſion, wanne her to his will. And in him you ſee the right progreſſe of this ſinne, when the deſire hath over-wonne the will and gained conſent, then doth the heart ſeeke the opportunity of time, place and like circumſtances, and by the fitneſſe of theſe Satan is ſo tempted to tempt, and the coales of luſt are
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:27208:226"/>
ſo blowed, that it flameth forth and carries a man or woman or both to act wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>If therefore any man would eſcape the foule acts of this ſinne, he muſt oppoſe himſelfe to the firſt deſires, and croſſe them by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtles command, <hi>flie fornication.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.18.</note> This ſinne muſt be run away from, the onely ſure and moſt ſafe way of eſcaping it is to run from it. If <hi>Shechem</hi> finding theſe deſires boyling within his heart by meanes of the fire that lighted in at his eye, would have oppoſed wiſe and vertuous thoughts, and ſo gotten himſelfe out of the company and ſight of the Maiden, his deſires had not drawne him to that which brought him to deſtruction, but he preſently fell to plot and contrive how he might get the Maide into ſome houſe and lonely place, and ceaſed not till he had ſo farre gratified his inordinate paſſion, and then loe he was not at his owne command to forbeare the lewd acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>You have heard <hi>Shechems</hi> fault,<note place="margin">2. What was good in him. 1. He continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to affect her when hee had defloured her.</note> next ſee what is commendable in him. Though hee had done the Maiden this wrong to devirgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate her, yet he continues to affect her, whereby it is probable that hee found her ſo chaſte as that ſhee did not willingly conſent unto the fore-mentioned evill act. But howſoever hee continues to affect her and deſires to repaire the wrong hee had done ſo much as it might be repaired by making her his wife. This is a matter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſome good commendation, that his heart is not eſtranged from her now when he had given his evill deſires ſome ſatisfaction, but he proceeds to ſeeke her in the way of Matrimony. The Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed too, that if any had inticed a Maiden, hee ſhould marry her and not be divorced from her during her life, unleſſe her Father would not grant conſent and then hee ſhould pay a fine in money.<note place="margin">Deut. 22.28, 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing praiſe-worthy in him is,<note place="margin">2. He acquaints his Father with his love to her and in treates him to ſpeake to her Father for him</note> he takes the right way to get her to wife by acquainting his owne Father with his owne affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and imploying him to her Father to mediate and make up the match. All you young men and women, learne the right, due, and honeſt courſe of proceeding in Matrimony, if you like any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and would faine beſtow your ſelves upon them. Acquaint your owne Parents firſt, and let their conſent be obtained, that they may alſo be your ſuitors, and ſo you may proceed with free conſent on all hands. This way of proceeding gives honour to Parents, brings comfort to children and yeelds obedience to God and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the rules of right reaſon. So did <hi>Sampſon</hi> too in his love, Heathen men you ſee here, and in <hi>Sampſon Iſraelites</hi> that were wiſe, and would goe on fairely, tooke this courſe. Let them that have beene more prepoſterous blame themſelves, repent; and learne to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low good examples, all you that are yet to marry.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, it was well done of the young man and his Father too,<note place="margin">3. He ſtood not over-much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on matter of portion.</note> that they ſtood not over-much upon matter of portion, but bid him aske dowry enough. I know that a wiſe care muſt be had this way,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:27208:227"/>
that the married couple may not want convenient meanes of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: for to marry without regard of thinking how to live when they be married, is ſo great a folly as doth ſhew him to be quite bereft of all good underſtanding that doth it, but yet money muſt not be the maine matter, as if one went to chaffer and buy and ſell when they goe to make marriages.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. He would have all things agreed upon before mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note>Another thing was commendable in this young man and his Father, they would have all matters agreed upon concerning dowry and other like conditions, and themſelves having agreed upon conditions are carefull to performe them, indeed they were neceſſitated, for they could not have the Maiden upon other termes. So it is good for Parents and all, to make ſome plaine and ſetled agreement of all worldly matters, that there may not fall out any interruption after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to the tormenting of the young peoples mindes with actuall breaking or feare of breaking.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in his love to the end</note>Againe, this young man was conſtant in his love to the end, and was fully ſetled and bent to marry the Maiden here. No man ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into termes of marriage in ſport or jeſt, but ſhould proceed ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſetled in that buſineſſe, eſpecially they who have once made a ſerious promiſe of marriage either to other with mutuall knowledge and conſent of Parents. I ſuppoſe that promiſes being not limited with any unperformed condition, they are bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to proceed unleſſe a great and very juſt let fall out, and I can ſcarce be made to thinke that they may breake off in ſuch caſe with mutuall conſent.<note place="margin">What betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is?</note> My reaſon is, God calleth the betrothed Maide his wife that hath betrothed her, and to mee it ſeemes, that betrothing is nothing but a ſerious promiſe of future marriage, and that nothing is eſſentiall to it but the fitneſſe of perſons for age, and the freeneſſe of undeceived conſent in reſpect of the perſons, and conſent of Parents mutually, who elſe may make voide a promiſe made to man, ſeeing they make voide a vowe made to God. If any of you therefore be guilty of inconſtancy in ſuch caſe, and of flying from ſuch promiſes, at leaſt let him be humbled, and conſider well with your ſelves what you doe before you betake your ſelves to others.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. His benefits. He was his Fathers heire who was a great man.</note>Hitherto the young mans vertues, now his benefits.</p>
            <p>He was his Fathers ſonne and heire, and his Father was the Prince of that City, he was a rich man and honourable in the place where hee lived, even the principall perſon of the houſe. This is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit indeed, if he that hath it uſe it orderly, ſo as to walke worthy of that place and eminency, and to get and exerciſe ſo much more vertue; but if it make him proud, bold to doe evill, as here it may ſeeme it did and very often doth, then it were better be the meaneſt of the family, and of the towne. You that be heires to wealthy Parents and likely by them to be wealthily left, O ſtand not upon theſe termes ſo as to lift up your hearts to ſwell, but carry humble hearts, and labour to add grace and vertues to your places, elſe they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:27208:227"/>
ſhall proove but as an high gibbet to bring you to more diſgrace in this world and torment in the next.</p>
            <p>The miſery of this <hi>Shechem</hi> was,<note place="margin">His croſſes. 1 He prooved an occaſion of the overthrow of his Father and his whole family and the Citie.</note> hee prooved an occaſion of the bane and overthrow of his Father and his whole Family, and of the whole City, and that by falling into the hands of bloody and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull men. O pray to God to keepe you from having occaſions with ſuch perſons, and being faulty of ſuch crimes. Beware of groſſe ſinnes and wrongs, for you know nor what ſharpe vengeance may lie in waite for you afterwards. Sinne is not all paide for in an inſtant, God doth ſometimes call ſinners to a ſevere reckoning even in this life beſides that which is to come.</p>
            <p>So much for <hi>Shechem</hi> the ſonne.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Hamor</hi> the Father, I have one fault to note,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hamor.</hi> His faults. 1. He was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcized for a by end.</note> he is ready to imbrace a religious adjunct, not for religion ſake but for ſome by end, even that he may get ſuch a wife for his ſonne as he deſireth. He imbraceth the religion for the womans ſake, not the woman for the religions ſake. Father and Sonne concurre in this fault.</p>
            <p>A common fault it is, religion is made of the by, it ſerveth ſome other Miſtreſſe. It is a ſtalking horſe for policy on both ſides. Wickedly doe <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes ſeeme to ſtand on religion for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ends, and it was not well done of them to take a religion up for meere private ends: but ſuch is the cuſtome of the men of this world, they can embrace any ordinance for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and any religion. O looke that you bee intire in imbracing Gods Ordinance and Gods Truth, take heed that ſiniſter ends doe not marre and deſtroy your ſeeming religiouſneſſe, and make that you ſhall ſeeme to God not the better men but the worſe Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
            <p>Againe, ſomething was ill done of him, we ſee no ſharpe correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor reproofe of his ſonne for his wrong done to <hi>Dinah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. He did not reproove nor correct his ſon for the wrong done to <hi>Dinah</hi>
               </note> and that provokes the maides friends.</p>
            <p>O how indulgent are Parents to their childrens crimes, ſcarce with a word will they checke them, at moſt but with a word for that which deſerveth many blowes, yea the ſtroake of death. This indulgence of theirs often makes children bold to ſinne, as in <hi>Adoniah</hi> and <hi>Abſalom</hi> is ſeene, and ſo doth make them at length correctors of their Parents, that ſhould have corrected them. Let Parents take heed to themſelves, that they ſhew not themſelves to love God leſſe then their children, by loving their children ſo much as to put out or ſmother the hatred of ſinne; and let Parents at laſt learne to make naturall affection give place to juſtice.</p>
            <p>You have his faults, his vertues are, 1. To his Sonne,<note place="margin">His vertues. 1. He is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſatisfie his ſonne in point of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſo farre as was fit.</note> he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſatisfie him in point of marriage ſo farre as was fit, and ſo ſhould all wiſe Parents be. If the affections of their children carry them not to matches too inconvenient, they ſhould gratifie them for feare of thoſe miſchiefes which often come by croſſing them, and that becauſe nothing is more likely to procure the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:27208:228"/>
of children, then when they be matched to whom they love; Unleſſe their folly be ſuch as to make too too fooliſh choiſes, let Parents learne to ſhew themſelves milde and gentle here if in any other thing.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. He deales well with his Subiects, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them to be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note>Further, he deales well with the <hi>Shechemites</hi> his Subjects, whom he ſeeketh not to force but to perſwade to accept circumciſion.

That is the wiſeſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which will moſt prevaile with him to whom it is uſed, and ſo it ſped accordingly.</p>

            <p>Now ſee his proſperity. He had a ſonne indifferent good, that at leaſt ſought his conſent and ſhewed himſelfe orderly, though at the firſt he had beene rude.

               <note place="margin">Hiram.</note>Now I proceed to ſpeake of ſome others. The <hi>Adullamite Hiram</hi> is a better friend then a man, indeed a good friend but a bad man. His friendſhip appeares to be morally good in its kinde,<note place="margin">
                  <p>Hee was a good morall friend.</p>
                  <p>His friendſhip was</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Laſting.</p>
               </note> becauſe firſt it was laſting, ſecondly, it was ſerviceable, thirdly, it was ſecret. Laſting, for it continued to <hi>Iudah</hi> ſo long, till his third ſonne was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigeable and began before his marriage. You cannot conceive it under ſome twenty yeeres ſtanding, though you ſhould thinke that <hi>Iudah</hi> married about ſixteene or ſeventeene yeares of age. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is like wine, the elder the better, the longer it laſteth, the more it is to be praiſed. Learne to be durable friends, let not a yeare or two ſee you changed and eſtranged, but be like Chriſt in that reſpect, whom you love love to the end, unleſſe they doe even too too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendlily caſt you off, and breake the lawes of friendſhip. And thoſe that have beene fickle friends, let them be aſhamed, for it is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:27208:228"/>
too too evident, that they were falſe, ſeeking themſelves alone and not their friends.</p>
            <p>Againe, his friendſhip was ſerviceable,<note place="margin">2. Serviceable.</note> ſtooping to ſomewhat a baſe office to helpe <hi>Iudah</hi> out with his whoredome as ſecretly and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedly as might be. Indeed a true friend muſt be ſerviceable to his friend not alone with his coſt and labour, but ſometimes alſo with a little blemiſh, not by helping him to ſinne, nor lying, or ſo forth, but by doing what may honeſtly and lawfully be done; for the ſecret carrying of his faults and ſaving him from blame, even carnall friends are forward enough this way; take heed that you denie not good offices to your inward acquaintance, and take no leſſe heed that you gratifie them not with bad.</p>
            <p>For here you ſee the ſecrecy of this <hi>Adullamite,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Secret.</note> no body knew by him of that fault which he himſelfe knew onely by <hi>Iudah.</hi> Nothing becomes a friend better then ſecrecy of his friends faults, and he that hath once played the blab in this kinde, hath no wrong if hee be never truſted after. Nay verily, this may ſeeme a moſt juſt cauſe of dividing friendſhip, therefore ſo farre as may be without ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and againſt the Countrey and Superiours, every friend muſt affect this truſtineſſe. Surely had not <hi>Iudah</hi> found him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in this kinde, hee would never have ingaged himſelfe ſo farre?</p>
            <p>So was <hi>Hiram</hi> a good friend, but yet he was not a good man,<note place="margin">Yet he was a bad man.</note> for we finde not that he did rebuke <hi>Iudah</hi> for his fault at all, which he muſt have done if he had beene as good a man as a friend. And doe you learne to add that to other good fruits of friendſhip, even to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them for their faults, though you doe not divulge them, that ſo friendſhip may not be a mutuall infecting of one another but a mutuall healing.</p>
            <p>So much for the <hi>Adullamite Iudahs</hi> friend,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan,</hi> the firſt was ſo wicked that God cut him off.</note> now for <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan Iudahs</hi> ſonnes.</p>
            <p>The firſt of them was ſo wicked a man, that God in his juſtice would not let him live to ſtaine that good family; O let him be a a warning to all you children that you proceed not to ſuch a height of wickedneſſe in your bloſſoming bud, as to force God to deſtroy you before the midſt of your daies. How ſure is his puniſhment in Hell whom God in his juſt wrath would not ſuffer to live on earth?</p>
            <p>And O yee Parents be thankfull if God have not croſſed you with ſuch wicked children, ſo notoriouſly, ſo unſufferably naught, or if hee have, learne to prepare for ſome untimely end of theirs, for often the Lord doth ſo at once correct the Parent and deſtroy the childe.</p>
            <p>And take heed that you take not that courſe to bring the ſame evill on your children, even to have God give them over to naughtineſſe and deſtroy them for it. How is that you will ſay.

He goes beyond our thoughts and beyond the intentions of thoſe which are his inſtruments, as a man makes his horſe ſerve his turne for the diſpatch of thoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:27208:229"/>
whereof the horſe is ignorant.</p>
            <p>Therefore we muſt learne to truſt his promiſes, even then when our eyes can ſee no way how to have them accompliſhed, it pertaines to him that makes a promiſe to finde meanes of making it good. If another have given his word to pay mee money, hee, not I, muſt take care to provide it. We wrong God and take his office to our ſelves if wee be ſollicitous about the meanes. If hee give us any we may uſe them, but if none, wee ſhould trouble our ſelves no further but waite upon him and let him alone with his owne workes.</p>
            <p>Againe, the <hi>Midianites</hi> and <hi>Iſhmalites</hi> for the whole troope conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of both, were carrying the precious things of another countrey into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they might ſell them there, and ſo by commerce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves and profit the whole world. It was well done of them that they employed themſelves in Merchandize, tranſporting by land the commodities of one place to another for the common good, and their owne convenient maintenance.</p>
            <p>Buying, ſelling, traffiquing,<note place="margin">Merchandize is commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> tranſporting of commodities from place to place are neceſſary actions, without which the inhabitants of the world could not partake of each others benefits, nor ſupply each others wants, and ſo ſhould not be knit together in ſo neere bonds; but by this meanes the ſeverall parts of the world or of any Nation, doe interchangeably communicate whatſoever neceſſary or delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing they have either to other.</p>
            <p>The more pitty it is to ſee men ſo beſotted with pride and vanity, that they thinke it a braver and gayer life to live idling at home and following baſe paſtimes, then to give themſelves to a commodious and ſerviceable imployment. But certainely, no calling nor paines in my calling can ſo much diſ-become a man, or reproach and abaſe him before God and men, that are not charmed with the ſame witchcraft that themſelves, then this of having no calling. Better a mender of ſhooes then have nothing to doe, better be the meaneſt member of the body, then a boyle or ulcer, ſuch as the idle man is.</p>
            <p>But let men that profeſſe the name of Chriſtians, look to themſelves that they ſhunne the vices with which mans corrupt nature doth pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute trading and Merchandize in reſpect of many particular abuſes.

warre, or elſe by debt; In warre the conquering ſide, that had the conquered in their power, having ſaved their lives, did make their perſons abſolute ſlaves unto themſelves, making this law too, that the children which they ſhould beget (bond-men and bond-women mixing together) ſhould be alſo bond-men. So came the greateſt number of ſlaves, men yeelding themſelves in battell, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſervants for ever. But it may ſeeme, that debt was another cauſe, when a man did owe more then he could pay, his perſon and his children became the creditors ſervants, that he might ſatisfie by labour what he was not able otherwiſe, ſo it came in.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Againe, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth maſters how to uſe their ſervants, and doth not command to manumit them, it is evident that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to have, and therefore alſo to buy and ſell ſervants. But it is a very commendable thing in Chriſtians, that they have as it were by a common conſent, laid downe this cuſtome of bond-ſervice, and left it to the Turkes and Pagans. So in this the Merchants offended not, but if they did by any meanes perceive that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was a free-man, as no doubt they did by his manner of carriage towards his brethren, then they did greatly offend in buying and ſelling him. If it be a ſinne to buy ſtolne goods if one knew them to be ſuch, much more to buy and ſell a free man (if one have any probable reaſons to declare his freedome) as if he were a ſlave, but it is uſuall with Merchants to buy any thing that promiſeth gaine, without conſideration how juſtly it be come by of them that ſell it, of which be you tradeſ-men warned, for thinke you what you pleaſe of it, it is a fearefull ſinne, and makes you partakers of the ſame unjuſtice which was found in the ſeller.</p>

            <p>

He would not appoint <hi>Ioſeph</hi> what proviſion to make for his belly, himſelfe would looke to that, to nothing elſe he would looke. So it may ſeeme he was as we uſe to terme ſuch perſons, a very belly-god, that tooke thought for nothing but good fare. If he had not beene too much given to his pallar, he would have left the matter of his tabling to him as well as other things, but that he which would brooke none other thoughts, would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe have an eye to his meate, it is a very probable proofe, that he was too great a friend to his belly, and over-loved fine and dainty fare. A man of place might have found ſome higher and nobler buſineſſe wherein to have imployed his freedome from domeſticall cares, then about the kitchin: but ſuch an epicure was <hi>Potiphar,</hi> that his mind ſoared little higher then a beaſts doth, to pleaſe his tooth and pamper his fleſh with delicacies.</p>
            <p>And I pray you be there not many gentlemen <hi>Potiphars,</hi> that leave all other affaires at randome, and overſee nothing but that they may fare well. Men of great ſtate have little elſe to doe, and will have little elſe but to cram themſelves, and ſhew themſelves good tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher-men. Buſineſſes of any moment they neither doe, nor will know how to doe, but ſtuffe themſelves with good victualls, and to get them a ſtomacke is the maine matter of their life, that they may eate a better meale, and digeſt it better. Such as give themſelves to live in pleaſure on earth, and nouriſh themſelves as in a day of ſlaughter,<note place="margin">James. 5.1.</note> are bidden by S. <hi>Iames</hi> to howle and weepe for the miſeries that ſhall come upon them, but for the moſt part they be growne ſo brawny-hearted, that they would but laugh at Chriſt himſelfe if he ſhould bid them weepe; yet if any amongſt you be ſuch that cares for no more but to give himſelfe over to ſports and feaſting, let him ſee how brutiſh he hath made himſelfe, and be ſure that Heaven is ſtill ſhut againſt <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſes,</hi> and Hell is ſtill open to receive them.</p>
            <p>Next, I ſhould thinke it a reaſonable exhortation to you that be Chriſtians, that if you have leiſure or freedome from other worldly cares, you would beſtow your time better then this <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> in ſome profitable ſtudy, in reading chiefely the Scriptures, and in a large beſtowing your ſelves on exerciſes of piety, and then in other fit knowledge, or knowledges whereby you may be better able to doe your countrey ſervice with comfort to your ſelves, you muſt account with God for time. If an idle word muſt come under a reckoning, ſure other no leſſe idle waſting of time ſhall not be ſlipped over. Live as thoſe that know there is a God, that he will call them to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ill and unprofitable ſpending of time ſhall goe for a crime. No man forbids you good fare, and a convenient meaſure of recreation by lawfull ſports, but to make your lives nothing elſe but a chaining of breakefaſt, dinner, ſupper together, with the linkes
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:27208:231"/>
of divers kindes of ſportes, if this be not a ready way to Hell, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I cannot find any in Scripture or in nature, that will bring men thither, doe you think that our Saviour ſpake the Parable of the rich glutton in vaine?</p>

He beleeved his wives cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſlander againſt his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</note>But another fault of his was, that he beleeved his wives cunning ſlander againſt his ſervant <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and was ſo wrath, that inſtantly he caſt him into priſon, very likely without calling him, or at leaſt patient hearing him to anſwer for himſelfe. Shee accuſed <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to have inticed her and offered to raviſh her, the man beleeves his wife, is in fierce wrath againſt innocent <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and impriſons him.</p>
            <p>It is a fault to receive a report or accuſation againſt any man with full beleefe, ſo as to ſuffer wrath to ariſe againſt the perſon accuſed, untill a man have well weighed the matter, and given the man accuſed leave to uſe all the good wayes of clearing himſelfe. And by how much the fault is the greater wherewith any one is charged, by ſo much eaſineſſe to beleeve it, and an over-ſpeedy intertaining of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is more blame-worthy, becauſe it ſhewes leſſe charity, for a common imperfection is very likely to be found in the beſt men, but we muſt ſee cauſe to ſuſpect him of great naughtineſſe, concerning whom we beleeve a grievous accuſation. It was <hi>Sauls</hi> fault alſo to be open eared unto falſe accuſers, indeed the conſideration of the perſon accuſing, a wife, her manner of doing it in ſuch a bold, and withall ſubtill faſhion, faigning her ſelfe to be ſo vexed at the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that her ſervant ſhould offer ſuch a thing to her, and then the ſight of his coat in her hand left there, as others that came in at her cry would witneſſe juſt upon his going out. All theſe mitigated his fault, but did not wholly excuſe it; for hee ſhould have conſidered how faithfull <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had ſhew'd himſelfe, and how vertuous, and ſhould not have conceived that he would ſo ſoone have turned ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately evill, as to have offered violence to his miſtris.</p>
            <p>Be you therefore humbled, if any of you have beleeved and beene angry with, and puniſhed ſo much as you could, another for a fault wherewith he was wrongfully burdened, if the end or iſſue make it appeare the party was innocent, though the perſon accuſing, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of accuſing may extenuate the fault of your credulity, yet it cannot utterly take it away.</p>
            <p>And now learne to uſe both eares, afore you credit a report or accuſation againſt any whoſe courſe hath beene vertuous and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, though it come even from a wife or perſon very neere. Indeed a man whoſe knowne evill carriage doth give it ſelfe for a very probable argument of his guiltineſſe, hath no wrong if a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable though not all out true narration be beleeved againſt him, but it is a great fault to credit a lewd tale againſt a <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> Search tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rougly into ſuch accuſers and accuſations, and be not angry at firſt, for that will hinder a man from being indifferent in ſearching out the truth of the matter.</p>

            <p>Firſt, hee marked the Faithfulneſſe of his ſervant, and his good ſucceſſe in all things, and accordingly both loved, truſted, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him in his houſe. It is a point of wiſdome in any man to ſhew due love and reſpect to a faithfull and proſperous ſervant, as after the Governour of the priſon did, and as <hi>Laban</hi> did before. To ſee this is a point of diſcretion, but to like and reward it, adds juſtice to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, vertue would be noted in the meaneſt condition, and where it is ſeene it is worthy to be honoured, eſpecially in a ſervant, by whoſe vertues a mans eſtate is ſo greatly furthered. It is a wrong to ones ſelfe and to all maſters, not to cheriſh good behaviour, by ſhewing good liking, and giving good reward. Therefore God commanded the maſters to impart to their ſervants when they ſet them free, ſome good part of the ſubſtance wherewith God had bleſſed them under their labours.

            <p>If any of you maſters have beene barren fig-trees to your faithfull ſervants, confeſſe it to be a fault of unjuſtice, and a kind of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, a fruit of niggardize and ſelfe-love, and a juſt cauſe to provoke God to give you ſuch wicked ſervants, as may become a plague to ſuch ſorry and pinching maſters.

            <p>And if any of you have beene ſo much favoured by the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as to be provided of theſe houſhould inſtruments, good and faithfull, and every way vertuous, let them afford them all encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements by all good uſage.

               <hi>that in Ieſus Chriſt there is neither bond nor free,</hi> the meaning is, that Chriſt will not reſpect men more or leſſe in reſpect of grace or ſalvation, becauſe of their being maſters or bond-men: therefore ſeeing God will reward a ſervants graces, why ſhould not maſters reward their paines? Nothing but worldly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedneſſe will oppoſe this exhortation, and none but very worldly minded men will neglect it.</p>
            <p>Another thing to be liked in him is,<note place="margin">2. He did not take away <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> life in a rage.</note> that he did but impriſon <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and not take away his life in a rage, conſidering what was the crime and who the accuſer.</p>

                  <p>Her faults. 1. Shee was an adulterous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               </note> Theſe were her faults.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſhee was a lewd, adulterous woman, not contented with her owne husband, but giving her eye leave to wander upon the comelineſſe of a ſervant of her husbands.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſhee was impudent and earneſt in her filthineſſe,<note place="margin">2. Impudent and earneſt in her filthineſſe.</note> would take no nay in her uncleane ſuite, but ſollicited <hi>Ioſeph</hi> againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine though he ſhunned her company, and at laſt watching her time to get him alone before he knew of it, ſhe grew to that outragious bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in luſt, as to lay hold on him and offer him as much violence as a woman could offer a man, catcheth him by the garment, and is not aſhamed to pull him to her, and intreate him to lie with her, holding him ſo faſt that he had no way left to be rid of her but to leave the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in her hand and get him out of the roome.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſhee was a moſt malicious woman,<note place="margin">3.

Here is luſt, here is impudencie, here is wilfullneſſe in luſt, here is bitter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and cauſeleſſe, here is ſubtilty and great craft, here is lying and great falſehood.</p>
            <p>O let all women and all men beware of theſe ſinnes; beware of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon a handſome body and a faire face with a luſtfull eye; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of nouriſhing luſtfull deſires; beware of impudency and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe; beware of alluring, enticing, almoſt compelling men to lewdneſſe; beware of hating thoſe whom you cannot win to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; beware of lying, falſe accuſing, laying ſnares to intrap men in and crafty and bold bearing out of lies; and beware of going on ſtill in ſin and carrying it out with an high hand.

no wonder that Satan could draw one of his owne ſlaves to doe this drudgery, but let none of thoſe that know and profeſſe to feare God proſtitute themſelves to lewdneſſe, malice, lying, and guile, take heed of giving your ſelves leave to be wanton; the woman that proſtitutes her body will ſoone become full of all other vices.</p>

                  <hi>Pharaohs</hi> But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and Baker.</note> ſome thing muſt be noted of a few more with whom he lived and had occaſion of commerce. Firſt, the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and Baker of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in whom wee may take notice, 1. That they were both Officers to a mighty King. 2. That they both did offend or ſeemed to offend their King. 3. They both were impriſoned. 4. That they both dreamed true dreames, ſomewhat like in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance but quite contrary in ſignification. Laſtly, that they felt the effect of their dreames, and that the Butler was forgetfull of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> a great while but at laſt remembred him. So wee have their good deeds, their bad deeds, their benefits,<note place="margin">1. Their good deeds.</note> their croſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:27208:234"/>
               <note place="margin">1. They bare their impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment patiently and cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Gen. 40.7.</note>The good deeds of both are that ſo farre as wee ſee they bare their impriſonment patiently and cheerefully, for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> witneſſeth that they had not beene ſad in former time, when he found their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance heavy for want of an interpreter of their dreames, ſaying, <hi>why are you ſo ſad to day,</hi> intimating that they wonted not to be ſo. There is a certaine naturall cheerefullneſſe that will beare a man out in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon croſſes, ſuch as impriſonment and make them merry, even though they lie by it, and be in ſome danger of death as theſe. This is a thing that lookes like vertue, but he that out of naturall wiſedome is cheerefull is morally vertuous, he that is ſo out of the ſight of God and the innocencie and quietneſſe of his conſcience, is religious. Labour to get ſo much grace as to prevaile more with your ſelves, then an Heathen man, even to beare all croſſes with an undejected coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, let not calamities make your lookes heavie. Indeed if we give our ſelves to grieve for our ſinnes upon occaſion of our croſſes, it is commendable, but ſadneſſe at a croſſe bewraies weakeneſſe of judgement, becauſe it is a booteleſſe macerating of ones ſelfe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelfe more miſerable then elſe the croſſe could make him. It is true, God hath ſet griefe amongſt our affections, that it might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what quicken us to ſhunne croſſes and to ſeeke an iſſue out of them, and ſuch quantity of griefe as is requiſite for that end, may well be entertained, though it ſwell not ſo big as to write it ſelfe upon our cheekes and countenance.</p>
            <p>But theſe two men whom impriſonment could not make to change countenance, yet became ſad when they wanted interpreters of their dreames. It was one of the waies by which the Lord was pleaſed to reveale himſelfe in thoſe times, this was a divine dreame offered unto each of them by God of purpoſe to finiſh the thing he had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and hence they cannot be cheerefull till they know the meaning of the dreame.</p>
            <p>To be heavie when we want fit meanes of making us underſtand that which much concernes us to know, is not blame-worthy. If theſe were ſad for want of a fit Interpreter of dreames, how much more cauſe have they to be ſad that want an Interpreter of Gods Word unto them? Did they as well know the neede of knowing the Scriptures, as theſe knew the want of an Interpreter, they would be ſad upon a juſter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. But it may ſeeme much that we meete with interpreters of dreames, yet it is likely, nay certaine, that there were ſome which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke that office, as there were that exerciſed other curious arts. I ſuppoſe that God who gave dreames to ſome, gave then to others the knowledge of interpreting of dreames, and hence the Divells imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God did ſet his Idolatrous Prieſts a worke to doe the ſame thing, and hence the Interpreters of dreames among the Gentiles. It was not to be diſcommended but rather approoved in theſe men, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had dreames, they would have ſought to the Interpreters, and were ſad that their opportunity ſerved them not. How much more ſhould we ſeeke to thoſe that can teach us better things, and are
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:27208:234"/>
appointed for that purpoſe and even be ſorry that wee want ſuch helpes?</p>
            <p>But another thing commendable is,<note place="margin">2. They deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not <hi>Ioſephs</hi> youth or meane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> that they deſpiſed not <hi>Ioſephs</hi> either youth or meane condition, but open their dreames. And indeed this is a thing which adverſity will worke men even of high ſpirits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, not to deny familiarity unto thoſe that be farre meaner then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is a matter of neceſſity, for a great Officer in priſon to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry himſelfe affably and ſociably to a poore youth attending in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but to be affable to meane perſons when preferment and liberty meete together, that is a point of morall vertue at leaſt. It is more beautifull in a great mans carriage, then any jewell or multitude of jewels in his apparell; whoſoever deſireth to be had in good account, let him ſhew forth this vertue.</p>
            <p>Another good act we have in the chiefe Butler, that when he was put in remembrance of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> by the falling out of the dreame of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the inſufficiencie of the other Wiſe-men to interpret, then he did a good office to his King (though I cannot call it a good office to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> as he did it) even to informe the King of it, and bring <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ability to light, and make this gift of his ſerviceable to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in this exigent.</p>
            <p>They doe a good office to a King or any other man, who helpe them to men of commendable ſufficiencies to doe any neceſſary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for them, and who certifie thoſe with whom they live what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits themſelves have received by another, that others may receive the like benefit in the like neceſſity. All men ſhould be ſo charitable to their neighbours, as to commend unto them the ſpring from whence themſelves have dranke refreſhing waters.</p>
            <p>But ſee the faults of theſe men,<note place="margin">Their faults. 1. They both ſeemed to commit ſome treſpaſſe.</note> firſt they both ſeemed to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome treſpaſſe (ſome matter of treaſon likely it was, becauſe the one died for it, and the other ſhould have died had he beene found guilty) you ſee how dangerous a thing it is to commit treſpaſſes againſt a Soveraigne King by any kinde of treacherous attempts or carriages, yea ſo much as in thought or word, for this is ſuch a thing as indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the offendor both in liberty and life. Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> warneth us not to meddle with ſeditions, and telleth us,<note place="margin">Pro. 16.14.</note> 
               <hi>that the wrath of a King is like the roaring of a Lyon,</hi> and that <hi>whoſoever ſinneth againſt him, ſinneth againſt his owne ſoule.</hi> It may befall an innocent man to be ſuſpected of this crime, as here it may ſeeme the Butler found by experience, but it is needfull that we carefully ſhunne the crime, though we cannot ſhun the ſuſpition. <hi>Feare God and honour the King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2 17.</note> let your hearts be ſubdued to his Majeſty, and your tongues and much more your hands.

poſſeſſion of the world; Hitherto their common faults.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Butlers ſpeciall fault the forgetting of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>
               </note>Now the ſpeciall fault of the Butler was forgetting of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> though <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> had beſought him to remember him, ſignifying alſo the wrong that he had in being brought either as a ſlave into the countrey, or as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner into that place, but the words of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> vaniſhed, and the chiefe Butler had quite forgotten him whom he left in priſon, now that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was gotten out of priſon. So is the guize of men, when themſelves have eſcaped croſſes, they remember not to be helpfull to others that are in like calamity, yea though they have beene beholding to them in the time of their miſery, and have found them inſtruments of great comfort in their miſery. This is an unthankfull kinde of unmercifull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it is a compound of two faults, want of pitty and want of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>I pray if any be guilty of this fault, let him not forget it now, but being put in minde of it by the hearing of a like offence in this Officer of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> let him ſee it to be as bad a vice in himſelfe, as at the reading of it he cannot chooſe but judge it in this Courtier. Had he ſeene ſo much ſerviceableneſſe, ſo excellent skill in ſo hidden a thing as interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of dreames, and ſuch excellent parts in <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and had himſelfe found him ſo true an Interpreter, as that all things came to paſſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his word, and was he not worth once thinking of for a whole yeares ſpace together? Sure he was glutted with his owne proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that in all thoſe daies could not find in his heart to caſt one thought backe againe to the priſon, and thinke of the wrong done to that ſo worthy a young man, who both miniſtred unto him in priſon and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his deliverance out of priſon.</p>
            <p>This forgetfullneſſe of a man to whom we have beene indebted in miſery, is a teſtimony that ſelfe-love hath ſo abounded in him as that it hath choaked and conſumed all charity. It is a moſt disbecomming vice, it cauſeth hard cenſures from every mouth that doth heare, he that hath practiſed it in himſelfe cannot but condemne it in another, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did his owne fault in a third perſon; forget not to blame your ſelves for having ſo forgotten.</p>
            <p>And now be taught to uſe your memory vertuouſly to remember thoſe that are indiſtreſſe and under injuries, and thoſe that have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with you, and thoſe that have beene inſtruments of comfort to you in the common ſorrowes that befell both. Memory cannot be better exerciſed next after the remembrance of God and his benefits and our ſinnes, then in remembring the miſeries of others, with whom once our own ſelves were joyned in the ſame miſery, and the kindneſſes we have received of them in our miſeries. And ſo much of the faults of theſe men.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Their croſſe. They were both impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note>Now of their croſſes, they both were impriſoned, and ſure impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment is a croſſe. To be limited to one chamber, to be denied the common benefits that bruit creatures enjoy, drawing in the freſh aire, and a free beholding of Heaven and Earth, to want the benefit of ones friends company, and be ſo reſtrained, that neither he can goe to them
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:27208:235"/>
nor they can come to him, to have one wall, one chimney,<note place="margin">Impriſonment is a croſſe.</note> one win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow for his proſpect, and either none or but a few and thoſe diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late perſons as himſelfe to talke withall, this is a croſſe I ſay ſo tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as none can judge of it but by experience, yet many perſons both of high place and of great vertues have ſuffered it.</p>
            <p>O now therefore let mee counſell you to be thankefull for liberty, and to praiſe God that hath not laid you faſt in ſome place of cuſtody, that hath ſet you at large and given you liberty to be with whom and where you would your ſelves, in your owne houſes, or in your friends houſes, or where you deſire to be, where you have no doores locked upon you, no keeper to ſhut you in and let you forth, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troler to take you up with ſurly words, none to finde fault with you in that kinde, or to exact upon you. I ſay, thanke God for liberty and know the benefit by having, which would ſeeme great unto you if you wanted it.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, uſe your liberty well, keepe your ſelves from ill company and ill courſes; runne not into places worſe then priſons, then when you be out of priſon. Moderate your ſelves in your free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that you may not be abridged of your freedome, eſpecially take heede of running into ſuch crimes, as ſhould cauſe you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve impriſonment. Harmefull creatures are chained or tied up, ſo muſt harmefull men, let your behaviour be ſuch, that you may not inforce Governours to lay you faſt, let not Satan get you into his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, be not priſoners to your luſts,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.13.</note> and in this ſence alſo I may uſe <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> words, <hi>Abuſe not your liberty as a cloake of maliciouſneſſe, or as an occaſion to the fleſh,</hi> the abuſe of mercies doth forfeit them and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth bitterneſſe to the want of them. If there be not a groſſe fatneſſe growne over the heart of a man, he will call to minde with anguiſh his unbridled walking in his liberty that now is bound to one place.</p>
            <p>But howſoever, learne to prepare for impriſonment and for that purpoſe keepe friendſhip with God in your owne conſciences, with whom you may comfortably conferre when the priſon doores be ſhut and your other friends are kept out from you. And labour to get the knowledge of the Word of God, the meditation of which may be ſweete unto you when ſolitarineſſe would elſe caſt you into your dumpes. He that can powre out his ſoule to God in prayers and in ſupplications and in thankeſgivings, may make his priſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to him, he that can heare peaceable anſwers from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may ſing Pſalmes in the ſtockes, and he that can meditate of Gods Word can never languiſh with ſolitarineſſe, when he lieth under lock and key and that himſelfe alone alſo.</p>
            <p>And another croſſe is to the Baker alone, he loſt his life violently,<note place="margin">The Bakers croſſe alone, he was hanged.</note> diſgracefully, and it may ſeeme deſervedly; for on the third day the King tooke them both out of priſon, and then putting them to triall, hanged the one and acquitted the other, reſtoring him to his place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:27208:236"/>To die an unnaturall, and ſhamefull and violent death is a miſery, a croſſe, a puniſhment, death at what doore ſoever it carry a man out of the world, is grimme enough to looke upon, but to hale a man out of the world by violence and diſgrace, makes his approach more terrible. Nature hates its owne deſtruction, the ſoule and body cannot well indure their ſeparation, but ſo much the leſſe by how much the deſtruction is more violent, and the parting more contumelious.</p>
            <p>Let us be thankfull to God therefore that hath taken our friends out of the world by faire and naturall deaths, and let us abhorre and ſhunne thoſe capitall ſinnes that may cauſe the Lord to bring us into the like miſery, and to pull us out of the world before our time, and with much contempt alſo: and let us be alwaies ready not for death alone, but for ſuch a kind of death. A man is to brooke reproach with death and as well as death. If onely malefactors did fall in this manner, it were our duty to care for no more but to prevent crimes, but ſeeing the innocent alſo have beene oppreſſed, witneſſe above all exceptions, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his bleſſed Prophets and Martyrs, now it is requiſite for us to prepare for a violent death, onely praying to God that wee may not pull it on our ſelves by our ſinnes, and then bearing it quietly, though it ſhould befall us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing ill, and moſt comfortably if it ſhould befall us for having done well.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Their benefits. 1. They were both in high place under a great King.</note>And ſo much for the croſſes of theſe men. Now their benefits.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they were both officers under a great King, enjoying places of honour, and like by too (if they wanted not good husbandry) of wealth.</p>
            <p>To have preferment and riches, or to be in the way of both, by attending upon a mighty Prince, is ſuch an outward thing as men make great account of; O how much more worthy a thing is it to be an attendant on God, and a ſpeciall officer as it werein his Court? They know not God and his ſervice, that cannot ſee an excellency in being admitted ſo neere to the King of Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. They had <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them in priſon.</note>But ſecondly, they had in the priſon an excellent perſon to attend them, and one of ſuch endowments, that was ready by diligence to miniſter any thing unto them, and by wiſdome to adviſe, counſell and informe them.</p>
            <p>It is a great happineſſe in miſery to meete with a perſon able and ready to comfort and cheere up a ſad heart by cheerefull ſerving and by hearty counſell. Hee is as happy as one can be in priſon, that hath a <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to be with him or to waite upon him; God can give this benefit to us, we muſt ſupplicate for it, and learne to make as great account of ſuch in proſperity as in adverſity.</p>
            <p>Now it might have beene to the Baker a benefit, if his want of due knowledge had not unfitted him to make it uſefull, that he had three dayes warning to fit him for death. There is no man that can promiſe himſelfe life for the ſpace of three dayes, but ſo eaſy are we to make
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:27208:236"/>
and beleeve promiſes of life to our ſelves, unleſſe we ſee the time of our life moſt inevitably determined, that we will hardly ſet our ſelves to prepare heartily for death, unleſſe we be made to ſee that now before ſuch a time we muſt needes die. But it is our duty to looke for that, and walke prepared for it that may come every houre, muſt come within a ſhort time; for what is the longeſt life when once the concluſion of it is come upon us.</p>
            <p>Againe, it was a benefit to the Butler,<note place="margin">
                  <p>The Butlers benefit.</p>
                  <p>He both knew he ſhould be delivered, and was delivered out of priſon.</p>
               </note> he both knew he muſt be delivered, and was delivered out of priſon, and retured to his place of honour againe.</p>
            <p>To have a comfortable deliverance out of croſſes is a benefit that we can eaſily diſcerne to be great, who doth not deſire it, rejoyce in it, pray for it and applaud others for it. It is therefore a great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God to grant it, indeed if one have beene caught by ſome affliction through wrongfull meanes, when nothing worthy thereof hath beene done by him; it is a favour of God to make his innocency knowne, and ſo to grant him a happy eſcape, but howſoever it is a mercy. But you ſee here it is a common mercy, be thankfull for it, walke capable of it, by being ſuch as God hath ingaged himſelfe unto, to deliver them out of all adverſity.</p>
            <p>And moſt of all, make a good uſe of your croſſes and deliverances both, that you may be better after a croſſe, and that your deliverance may deliver you alſo from ſinne. Hee that getteth not ſome more grace in adverſity then he had before it came, and doth not uſe that grace after to ſhew himſelfe to have profited by his croſſe, comes out of a croſſe none otherwiſe then a beaſt may ſcramble out of a ditch, and to ſuch an one a worſe thing ſhall befall afterwards. And ſo much for this couple.</p>
            <p>Now we proceed to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelfe King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> we conſider in him the ſame things, his good and bad deeds, the good and bad occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that befell him.</p>
            <p>Firſt for his good deeds,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his good deeds. Hee was wiſe and had good morall parts. 1. Hee uſed all the meanes he could to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his dreame.</note> 
               <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was indeed an Heathen and an Idolater, but he ſeemeth to have beene a man of good wiſedome and morall parts, the good deeds recorded of him in Scripture are theſe. Firſt, having dreamed a divine dreame, I meane a dreame ſent to him of God for ſome ſpeciall purpoſe, he uſed all the waies he could to come to the knowledge of it, and was much troubled when he ſaw that he could not attaine the interpretation of it. For a dreame was but a kind of riddle or ſimilitude offered unto a man in his ſleepe, which did darkely, and yet truely repreſent ſome truth, neceſſary for him to know. Indeed ſometimes God did appeare to his ſervants in dreames without any ſuch darke and obſcure revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in expreſſe and plaine termes did tell them the things which they were to know, as in the dreames of <hi>Abimelech</hi> and of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but many times he appeared to them alone in ſimilitudes, yet ſo that he made them know the meaning eaſily, as in <hi>Ioſephs</hi> dreames, and in <hi>Iacobs</hi> dreame of the ladder, now ſuch an enigmaticall dreame being
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:27208:237"/>
offered unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he ſought all meanes of getting the interpretation of it: ſurely we ſhould much more ſeeke to attaine the knowledge of the Scripture, and deſire to have ſome to interpret the ſame unto us where it is doubtfull and obſcure. And if we neglect to ſeeke the meaning of it, we ſhall doe as much wrong to our ſelves as <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſhould have done to himſelfe, if he had ſleighted this dreame, for then ſhould his land have beene conſumed by famine as well as other lands. Therefore ſince God hath appointed you his written word for your inſtruction in matters concerning ſalvation, as then he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by dreames to reveale what hee ſaw fit unto men, ſee that you ſeeke to know the word of God as he ſought to know theſe dreames. Onely know this, that often the wiſe men and men of repute in the world, cannot tell you theſe things, but ſome poore impriſoned and neglected <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> This is <hi>Pharaohs</hi> firſt good deed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. He contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not <hi>Ioſeph</hi> becauſe he was a poore ſervant and of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree Joh. 1.46.</note>Nex when he heares of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> he contemnes him not becauſe hee was a poore ſervant and of low degree, but is carefull to ſend for him and to conſult with him, and by this meanes attaineth to the knowledge of that which all his inchanters, wiſe-men, and diviners could not helpe him unto.</p>
            <p>Surely it is a point of wiſedome not to ſleight men becauſe of their outward meaneneſſe, but without prejudice to conferre with them if we heare good of them, and to be ready to hearken to their wiſe words. <hi>Can any good come out of Nazareth,</hi> ſaith <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> prejudice againſt the meanes of Chriſts birth and education would have kept him from Chriſt, if he had not followed <hi>Philips</hi> adviſe, who bid him <hi>come and ſee.</hi> It pleaſeth God to triumph over the folly of men, that will meaſure things by worldly greatneſſe, and to give them over to undoe themſelves. In <hi>Ieremies</hi> time the Prieſts and men of note were oppoſite to him; ſo Chriſt was therefore neglected becauſe he was the ſonne of a Carpenter. Take heede that you meaſure not men by their high place and worldly accoutrements, God is often pleaſed to ſleight great ones and to reſpect the meaner: In this caſe learne wiſedome of <hi>Pharoah</hi> and judge not by the appearance.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. When hee ſaw <hi>Ioſephs</hi> wiſdome hee preferred him.</note>Thirdly, when he ſaw the high wiſedome that God had given to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> he prefers him, and makes him chiefe ruler of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome next under himſelfe, and commits into his hand the care of gathering corne in the yeeres of plenty, to ſerve againſt the yeeres of famine.</p>
            <p>Oh how deſirable a thing is it in Princes to commend men to high place for their worth ſake? And how happy is that nation, when not a mans either friends, or money, or flattery, or ambitious inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of himſelfe, but his parts, the abilities God hath given him, and fitneſſe to diſcharge an high place, is the rule which the Prince doth follow in advancing men? It ſhall procure a world of welfare to the ſtate, and comfort to the Prince, to whom the Lord giveth ſo much wiſedome, as thus to diſpence places of preferment. But I ſpeake to ſubjects, wee muſt be helpefull to our Soveraigne Lord
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:27208:237"/>
with our prayers, that is all which our hands can reach unto.</p>
            <p>A fourth thing is, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> continued to favour <hi>Ioſeph</hi> all his life long,<note place="margin">4. Hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to favour <hi>Ioſeph</hi> all his life long, and favoured his Father and brethren for his ſake.</note> and for his ſake ſhewd great reſpect unto his bretheren and to his Father, ſending for him willingly and ſaluting him curteouſly, and planting him and his in the fruitfull place of his Kingdome, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for cattle, even in the land of <hi>Goſhen.</hi> Thus it behoveth a good King, yea and a good man, to favour ſtill whom he hath begun de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly to favour, and for his ſake to ſhew all good eſteeeme to his friends and kindred, ſo farre as they ſhew not themſelves unworthy to be favoured. Conſtancy in loving and honouring a worthy man becomes Kings, and largeneſſe of love, even a kind of royall love, beſeemeth their perſons and places, for a worthy ſervants ſake to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Father, Bretheren and kindred. This is a right Kingly love, and ſuch as can ſort alone with men of ſuch high quality. Meaner perſons want meanes to ſhew their favourable reſpect in ſuch a ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding manner. Indeed to preferre unworthy perſons, becauſe they be of kinne to a man of great worth and much favoured, is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the rules of wiſdome; but let them be men capeable of favour, and he doth not love a man thoroughly, that for his ſake doth not alſo love thoſe that are neere unto him. And if Princes have ſuch a Princely love to their vertuous favourites, how much more hath the living God to his? Theſe be things commendable in <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his faults,<note place="margin">His faults. Hee continued a Heathen though he had a <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in his Court.</note> God hath beene pleaſed to reveale none but that common fault, hee continued an Heathen though he had a <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in his Court, and highly preferred by himſelfe. It is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to get out of darkeneſſe and to come into light, a divine ſpirit muſt joyne with the meanes, or elſe the meanes will prove inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall.</p>
            <p>Let us pray to God to leade us into the knowledge of his truth, or elſe we may live long with them that know it, and yet learne nothing of it. It is in our nature to ſettle our ſelves in the religion of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and not to conſider whether it be true and good, yea or not. A kind of ſliteneſſe in matter of religion, doth raigne in the world, men will not be at the trouble to examine that which they find in uſe, they will not hazard themſelves in croſſing the common-voice; ſo they ſwimme downe the ſtreame, and runne into perdition for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Let us be carefull to examine the things that we finde, and ſeeing God hath vouchſafed us the happy guidance of his word, let us <hi>learne to try all things and hold faſt the good:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 5.21.</note> Onely in crying we muſt take heede that we be not of a kind of croſſe humour, that will ſtrive to goe in a ſingle way, and will refuſe things upon ſleight grounds, as if they were glad to find occaſion to goe alone.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:27208:238"/>
that a man may hide himſelfe from the evill of them, the wiſedome of man can alone gueſſe of future things, and of ſome it cannot ſo much as gueſſe. O how great favour doth God ſhew to men when he will lend them a little part of his Wiſdome, and tell them what miſchiefes are comming on the world. So God told <hi>David,</hi> how <hi>Saul</hi> and the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would have conſpired againſt him, Chriſt foretold his Diſciples of the ruine of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and made them able to ſave themſelves out of that deſtruction. Now wee muſt learne to eſteeme it a greater mercy, that we are forewarned of the evill to come in another world, and acquainted with the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes of flying from that unſufferable wrath. Let us be as carefull to beleeve thoſe predictions and to follow that counſell for eſcaping the miſchiefe foretold, as here <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was to beleeve <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> and to take his counſell, and then ſhall we as aſſuredly eſcape the miſery of eternall deſtruction, as he and his Countrey eſcaped the unhappineſſe of Famine.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">God gave him a faithfull and wiſe ſervant.</note>A ſecond benefit, God gave <hi>Pharaoh</hi> a <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> a worthy ſervant, a man of excellent Wiſdome and faithfullneſſe, fit for that high honour of being Second to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who in all things behaved himſelfe as became a wiſe and godly man. The Lord cannot give a greater benefit to a King and a Kingdome, then by preferring a <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> by providing ſuch a man, and inclining the hearts of Kings to favour ſuch; this is a mercy which our prayers muſt obtaine for our King and for our ſelves. Lord ſend <hi>Ioſephs</hi> to the Court, and guide the heart of his Majeſty to love and advance <hi>Ioſephs.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">3.

But when Princes or other men become very great and high, many times their weakeneſſe and corruptions turne that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit into a miſery and occaſion of much miſchiefe; learne ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this benefit, as to be earneſt for grace, to uſe it well that it may not turne to your deſtruction.</p>

               <note place="margin">Their vertues They ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note> and a great vertue it was they ſubmitted themſelves to their Governours with a very great ſubmiſſion.

            <p>O that we could ſee our duty in theirs, and learne to ſubmit our ſelves ſo conſcionably to our Governours, that nothing may drive us to ſedition or rebellion. A man might have brought great ſhew of reaſon, why the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhould have refuſed to ſell themſelves and their lands, if he would have given leave to wit and words: but theſe men are content to ſtoope ſo farre, rather then to forget that they were ſubjects.

            </p>
            <p>Now for the faults of <hi>Egypt,</hi> I have one to marke, it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Their faults. They were mad with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</note>

            <p>Now more particularlie,<note place="margin">2. More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</note> conſider what was good in him in his Fathers houſe, and in Aegypt, for ſo may his life bee fitly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, by the places wherein he lived.</p>
            <p>In his Fathers houſe. 1.<note place="margin">
                  <p n="1">1. His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe. Gen. 37.2.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted his father with his brethrens ill carriage.</p>
               </note> He was willing to tell of his Brethrens ill carriage unto his Father, ſo that they might be reformed. Thoſe of you that are of ſo ſlender authoritie or power, by reaſon of their youth, or upon other conſiderations of meanneſſe of eſtate, or the like, that their owne admonitions are not likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with offendors, ſhall doe a good office, if they make knowne the faults of ſuch offendors to their betters and ſuperiours, that ſo the care may be wrought by another hand, which themſelves cannot worke.</p>
            <p>Thus they of the houſe of <hi>Cloe</hi> complained to <hi>Paul</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and diviſions that were ſo rife and ſcandalous amongſt the <hi>Corinths.</hi> This a man is enjoyn'd and bound unto by the rules of Charity, which command him to ſeeke his Brothers amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reformation of thoſe things that are evill. I know
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27208:241"/>
that moſt men will hate ſuch as complaine of them, and call them tel tales, but this kinde of, complaining may bee carried cloſely enough, that it ſhall not procure envie to the complainer, if the Governour will uſe his diſcretion, and take care to find it out ſome other way, as in moſt caſes he may, rather then to ſeeme to have come to the knowledge of it by ſuch a meanes. But if it cannot be concealed, all men muſt forme their duties, though they hazard themſelves to ſome ill will and danger.</p>
            <p>Now you children and Servants, that live together in families, take notice of Joſephs example if you ſee any evil way of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon inferiours, ſpeake to them, admoniſh them if it be fit, and if they will not reforme, bring their bad deedes to their parents, or maſters eares, that ſo you may not partake in their ſinnes, for want of uſing due meanes to reforme them: Onely take heed,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that you be not apt to complaine for every light weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which ought to be paſſed by, and</p>
            <p>Secondly, that you never aggravate any thing, much leſſe faine, lye, counterfeit; for falſe and ſlanderous complaining againſt a ſervant to his maſter, is forbidden expreſſely by <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſaying, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe not a Servant to his Maſter:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 30.10.</note> the word is uſed to denote ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and malitious accuſations, and ſuch muſt be avoyded in reſpect of ſervants, and men of lower ranke, that by ſetting their bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters againſt them, they may not occaſion much cauſeleſſe miſery to them.</p>
            <p>Againe, if there be any that have chafed, and entertained great diſcontent againſt their fellow ſervants, or others, for telling of their faults, to their Governours; they muſt now condemne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for this ungrounded and cauſeleſſe anger, eſpecially if they have beene firſt admoniſhed, and no amendment hath followed; yea, though the others have told it firſt to their Governours, the fault being groſſe, and themſelves ſo low, as there was no likeli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hood that they ſhould have beene heard, for why ſhould any man be offended becauſe another hath done his duty, and imitated ſo good an example as Joſeph? For ſeeing all men muſt take heed of partaking of others faults, they ſhall partake in thoſe, they ſeek not to reform by ſuch fit meanes as they may uſe: and this of complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Governours, is a fit meanes, it followes that they were bound in Conſcience to open their mouthes in this kinde, and it is doubtleſſe a ſinne to bee offended with another, for that which hee could not omit without Sinne. This falling out with him that hath detected a mans faults, is an evident ſigne of a man that loves his Sinne, and would willingly live in it, but for feare of puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Joſeph whilſt hee lived in his Fathers houſe, had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Dreames afforded unto him, as foretelling his owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, and theſe hee faithfully and truly told unto his Father, and unto all his Brethren, although his Brethren
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:27208:241"/>
did hate him for it, and his Father ſeemed to rebuke him,<note place="margin">2. He had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Dreames Gen 37.6, 7. Which he told to his Father and Brethren.</note> but his reproofe was very gentle, and rather for faſhion ſake to mitigate his Brethrens anger, then becauſe hee eſteemed him an offendor in telling his Dreames. So it behoveth all men to communicate their knowledge unto others, ſo farre as is convenient, eſpecially thoſe whom God hath made ſeers, and put into an office of teaching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, muſt bee carefull to inſtruct them, though the things bee ſuch, as they will rather hate them for, then accept.</p>
            <p>Dreames were at that time Ordinances of God, to inſtruct men; If Joſeph could not forbeare to tell his dreames, how much leſſe ſhould any forbeare to inſtruct, teach, or admoniſh their fellow-ſervants, or brethren, or any that are neare to them. Young <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> did tell his maſter <hi>Eli</hi> his Dreame, and did well in telling it, yea, <hi>Eli</hi> charged him with great earneſtneſſe to tell him all the truth: But let men be ſure their Dreames bee from God, before they tell them, I meane, that they have juſt cauſe to ſpeake, and that it bee the certaine truth they ſpeake, before they ſpeake to any.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, while Joſeph was young,<note place="margin">3. He was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to his Father. Gen. 37.13, 14.</note> hee ſhew'd himſelfe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his Father, for when he called him to ſend him to viſit his Brethren, hee was ready to obey him, and did the office of a duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sonne, addreſſing himſelfe to the appointed buſineſſe, although it was to take a journey of two or 3 dayes on foot. Come young men and young women, and learne of this good youth how to carry your ſelves to your Parents; if they call you, come, and give them dutifull and mannerly anſwers, if they ſend you, goe, and preferre the doing of their will in lawfull things, before your owne eaſe and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>You know how preciſely the Lord hath impoſed this duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſciences of children; <hi>Children obey your Parents in all things.</hi> You muſt make no reſtriction of the largeneſſe of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, but by adding that word, Lawfull, which out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures muſt needes bee underſtood, and hee gives a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſaying, <hi>this is the firſt Commandement,</hi> meaning of the ſecond Table, <hi>with promiſe,</hi> and with promiſe of welfare, ſaying, <hi>that it may bee well with thee.</hi> As ever you deſire to finde proſperity from God, ſo you muſt bee dutifull to your Fathers and Mothers, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your beeing, and bringing up, and the moſt immediate Deputies of God and you, which hee hath ſet in his ſtead, to take care of you, and to rule you.</p>
            <p>Now you that are ſinfull and diſobedient Sonnes and Daughters, whoſe carriage doth farre differ from that of Joſephs, ſee the fouleneſſe of your Vice, by oppoſing unto it the faireneſſe of his Vertue.</p>
            <p>Doe not your hearts within you ſay, that it was very well done in Joſeph to ſay to his Father, here am I, when hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to goe on his errand, and when his father had told him his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27208:242"/>
work by and by to ſet about it, doe you not thinke that Joſeph did the office of a godly childe, and that which his duty bound him to, and wherwith God was well pleaſed? If he did, as your ſelves muſt needes affirm he did, be you grieved &amp; aſhamed within your ſelves, of your quite contrary carriage, whoſe conſciences can tell, that inſtead of anſwering here I am, have retained ſome ſurly anſwer, and inſtead of going on the buſineſſe, have gone a quite contrary way. Let your hearts ſmite you to Repentance, that you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your Parents with obedience hereafter, whoſe hearts you have formerly vexed by your graceleſſe ſtubborneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. He intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſel him to ſtrangers.</note>Fourthly, when <hi>Ioſephs</hi> Brethren uſed him exceeding injuriouſly and hardly, viz. ſelling him to forrainers, for a Bond-man: what did he, but even intreat and beſeech them to deale better with him? as themſelves tell of his carriage, when they were touched with ſome remorce for their cruelty. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. <hi>He beſought us, and we would not heare.</hi> Loe how it behoves a good body to behave himſelfe to his equals or betters, or any, that being too ſtrong for him, when they doe offer hard meaſure unto him, even intreat, pray, beſeech, uſe all ſubmiſſive, gentle, quiet and milde words, and carriage. Learne that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> who ſaith, <hi>being defamed, we intreat.</hi> You know <hi>Abigals</hi> carriage toward <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.23.24.</note> when ſhe found him in a great chafe againſt her husband, and ready to doe violence to her family, ſhe intreated him, and cauſed his paſſion to ſtoppe it ſelfe by her faire words.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Proverb.</hi> 15.1.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi> hath told us, that <hi>gentle words pacifie wrath:</hi> and if any thing in the world will aſſwage the fury, and mollifie the hardneſſe, and remove the cruelty of an enemy, it is this kinde of language and behaviour: If therfore any of us be guilty of betaking our ſelves, in ſuch caſe, to railing, bitterneſſe, and violence, giving all the vile tearmes, that wrath would put into our mouthes, againſt our Superiours, when they wronged us, and dawbing them with moſt foule names, let us take notice of our folly in being wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>This was not the courſe that naturall diſcretion, much leſſe that Chriſtian Religion would preſcribe to a wronged man: this ſhews him to be as proud and bitter, that ſuffers, as they that offer the wrong.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.</note> S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>we ſhould not render, reviling for reviling,</hi> if we muſt not raile on him that abuſeth us in words, neither then on them that abuſe as in actions. Now then learne meekeneſſe of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> learne to frame your tongues to this kinde of humble ſpeech, when you be wronged.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you may ſay, that Joſeph did this becauſe he durſt doe no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, if he feared his Brethren, are not you to feare God? if hee durſt not ſpeake wrathfully to them, that hee might not the more provoke and move them, should not you take heed of provoking GOD with the licentious uſe of your evill tongue?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:27208:242"/>But ſecondly I anſwer that it is very probable, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did not this out of bare feare, for then when he ſaw that the matter grew deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and hee could not prevaile by intreaty, he would have fallen to bitterneſſe at laſt; wherefore follow his mildneſſe, beſeech when you are wronged, but doe not rayle and revile. This is all I have noted of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> private life in his Fathers houſe,<note place="margin">
                  <p n="2">2. His good carryage in Egypt in <hi>Puti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phars</hi> houſe.</p>

               </note> now we will follow him into Egypt, and ſee how he carryed himſelfe there. 1. in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate in the houſe. 1. of <hi>Putiphaer</hi> 2. in priſon, 2. more publikely. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> carriage in <hi>Putiphars</hi> houſe deſerveth praiſe, 1. becauſe he was a diligent and faithfull ſervant unto him, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had beene bred up ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly as the free ſonne of a noble and great man <hi>Iacob;</hi> of a ſodaine God by his providence made him a bondman, he frames himſelfe to ſuch dutifulneſſe and fidelity, that he winnes his Maſter, and gaineth greater favour with him then any other ſervant, as you may reade <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. <hi>ad</hi> 7. For had not he beene faithfull and painefull, God had not beene with him nor proſpered him as he did.</p>
            <p>Let me commend his example to you that be ſervants to imitate it, labour you to be good ſervants, faithfull, diligent in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters buſineſſe and reſpective towards their perſons, that ſo God may be with you too, and proſper you, and you alſo may draw the loves and good wils of your Maſters. Your ſervice is not bond ſervice, but free ſervice, at the worſt it is but a ſervice of eight or nine yeares likely.</p>
            <p>See the commandement of God lying upon you as much as it did upon <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and doe that which you ſee in him is poſſible to doe; this is the way to make your ſervice moſt eaſie and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to your ſelves, and moſt acceptable and pleaſing to God: you are ſervants now, you may be Maſters or Governours hereafter, ſo frame your ſelves in the function of ſervants, that God may bleſſe you with good ſervants. Carry your ſelves towards your Maſters, as you would wiſh your ſervants to carry themſelves to you, and for the moſt part, you ſhall find that in this as well as in other things the Lord will returne a mans owne meaſure into his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. The living God markes the carriage of ſervants, accepts their diligence and fidelity, and rewards it, and it is as evident a note of true piety, to be a good ſervant, as a good King or a good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and that will make you good ſervants, if you know that in ſo doing you ſhall be accepted by God, and have your wages from him, if your Governours ſhould be froward.

O be humbled in ſeeing your ſelves ſo unlike to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> you would be accounted good Chriſtians as he was a good ſon to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and be ſorrowfull you have not approved your ſelves ſuch as he did approve himſelfe. When we ſee the godlineſſe of thoſe whom the Scriptures commend unto us, we muſt take notice of our own naughtineſſe with remorſe and ſorrow, and runne to God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and reforme it.

Secondly, in his Maſters houſe this godly man ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the true feare of God, in that he forbare to commit a ſinne to which he was ſo vehemently ſolicited, ſaying to his Miſtreſſe, <hi>How ſhall doe this great evill, and ſinne againſt God, Gen.</hi> 39.9. Wee muſt all labour to plant an awfull apprehenſion of Gods greatneſſe, juſtice, and preſence in our minds, that wee may not dare to ſinne againſt him, this is the vertue ſo much commended in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo often required, and that hath ſo many promiſes made unto it! This is that vertue which muſt prove our knowledge of God and our faith in him: I meane a not daring to ſinne in reſpect that wee know it is offenſive to him, and will provoke him againſt us: This vertue will hold the heart from ſecret ſinne, and ſuch to which wee are much ſolicited &amp; perhaps alſo much inclined. He that hath this grace is mounded and armed againſt the ſtrongeſt temptations of Satan and of evill men.<note place="margin">Eſa. 33.6.</note> No man can doe himſelfe a better turne then to abound in it, the Prophet calls it <hi>our treaſure.</hi> He that hath gotten it in any good quantity, hath gotten the richeſt treaſure in the world, and that which will doe him more good then all gold and ſilver. <hi>Salomon</hi> calleth it the beginning or head, or chiefe part, or firſt fruits of wiſdome. It is a grace which maketh knowledge uſefull, which elſe will end or rather vaniſh in meere diſcourſe and twattle. It is a grace that cannot be found, but in a heart thoroughly ſanctified: he that hath it is ſure to find favour with God, and to walke holily with God. No man can ſufficiently ſet forth the excellency of this grace? It is that by which we muſt worke out our ſalvation, without which wee cannot hold out in the way of piety, it muſt helpe us againſt falſe feares and falſe hopes, againſt pleaſure, againſt profit, againſt credite, againſt diſcredite, againſt all the wayes that Satan hath to draw us to ſinne.

            <p>Thirdly, this worthy man had a thankefull and loving reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Maſter, for ſaith he, my Maſter hath thus and thus honoured &amp; truſted me, and ſhall I ſo requite his love as to defile his wife? you ſee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27208:243"/>
that every man ought to take great heed of wronging that perſon in any thing from whom he hath received much kindneſſe in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>The good that another hath done as ſhould offer it ſelfe unto our minds to make us ſtedfaſt in forbearing to doe any thing that may wrong him, as we ſhould abſtaine from injurying a benefactour in his wife or goods, or name, or in his children, or in his body, or in any other reſpect. Conſider if you have beene thus thankefull or not, and he that is proved by the verdict of his owne ſoule to be ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, (having not remembred good turnes received, to make him temper himſelfe from injuries) let him know, that this ſhall be a great aggravation of his fault, that what ſhould have prevayled to withdraw a man from ſinne, and hath not, ſhall certainely prevaile to make his puniſhment the more grievous:</p>
            <p>Haſt thou wronged any one in his good name, wife, &amp;c.

            <p>And now tread in <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſteps this way, ſhew that you doe account your ſelves indebted for favours and curteſies, by having them ready in your minds, as a diſſwaſive from any manner of injuriouſneſſe, to them in whoſe debt you ſtand for ſuch curteſies.

            <p>But fourthly, This <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſhewes forth that excellent vertue of chaſtity, and that in an high degree, for being a young man, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and often, yea almoſt continually importuned by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe to commit adultery with her, he continues to repell her temptations with a peremptory denyall, and ſhuns her company by all the wayes he can, &amp; when ſhe caught him at ſuch an advantage once, that having him alone ſhe durſt lay hands upon him, and offer as much violence as that ſexe could offer in that caſe, he leaves his garment with her and runnes out, ſo farre is he from yeelding; a truer and nobler patterne of continency, how can we thinke of? If we conſider his age and his perſon and the perſon of the ſolicitteſſe, and the continuance of her evill ſuit, and her earneſtneſſe in it, how great a patterne is he of conſtant and invincible purity? But the words that can be beſtowed in commending him will all fall ſhort of his worthineſſe,<note place="margin">Chaſtity is an excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note> I ſhall endeavour to commend this grace unto you, chaſtity is a ſweet and excellent vertue.</p>
            <p>The keeping of the Body pure and undefiled, and forbearing to mixe ones ſelfe with any perſon not allowed by God, according to his Ordinance, eſpecially when ſtrong temptations are offered to inflame libidinous fancies, deſerveth great praiſe, for it ſhewes

that the heart is fully reſolved not to doe evill. Indeed if the not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining of ſuch motions ariſe from inability of body and unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſatisfie them, this cannot be called caſtity, but debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

            <p>I goe on to ſhew how Joſeph behaved himſelfe in the houſe of his Priſon, and that to his Maſter there the Jaylor,<note place="margin">

            <p>Firſt, he fell to his old trade of diligence and faithfulneſſe, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying himſelfe in ſo vertuous a manner, that the Jaylor did affect him, and liked him more and more, till at laſt he intruſted him with all the charge of the priſon. This was a great truſt, for you know what extreame danger a Jaylor, chiefely of ſuch priſoners, doth put himſelfe in, if his priſoners eſcape: there againe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all inferiours be perſwaded to ſeeke to winne their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, by good and vertuous carriage, eſpecially meekeneſſe, ſubmiſſiveneſſe, painefulneſſe and truſtineſſe. This will worke a man into favour, even with an hard maſter, but I ſpake of that matter a little before, I will ſhew you his carriage to the priſoners, to whom he was an Attendant, it is commendable in theſe three reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt he ſhew'd himſelfe deſirous to comfort them,<note place="margin">Gen. 40. 3 He ſtrives to comfort the priſoners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſad, which he attended upon.</note> when they were ſad and dejected, asking them why they were ſad: had hee not bin of a kinde and tender diſpoſition, he would not have hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded how a perſon, to whom himſelfe had no, more relation, had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether ſorrowfully, or merrily; but ſo kinde was hee, that hee ſeekes to comfort them, by asking them the cauſe of their ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſeeking to remove it. We ſhould all learne to practice this courteouſneſſe to all men, chiefly to ſuch as are in affliction otherwiſe, even helpe to raiſe up their hearts with good words, and ſo much as we can, to become inſtruments of cheering them, as you ſee Joſeph intreating to know their Dreames, and diligent to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the ſame. It is an excellent vertue to be ready to comfort the afflicted, and to revive the ſpirits of them that bee caſt downe, ſo farre as we be able, but a churliſh, careleſſe temper, whereby a man cares not whether men cry or laugh, be merry or ſad, is a proofe of much pride and ſtupidity of ſpirit, and muſt be abhorred.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:27208:245"/>
all evidence and perſpicuity ſhew the things which God hath told them, and muſt not not hide or alter any thing at all; what God declareth, they muſt declare, making manifeſt alſo the certainty and ſpeedineſſe of the things, both that they ſhall ſurely come to paſſe and preſently, in the due time appointed.</p>

            <p>Secondly, marke his wiſedome and prudence,<note place="margin">2.

So thoſe that are to interpret Gods Word to his people, muſt adde counſell, advice, perſwaſions, and exhortations to provide them to make good uſe of their knowledge, even to provide againſt the danger to come, and to make uſe of all thoſe good helpes, which God ſhall affoord them for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>We have now plentifull times of ſpirituall proviſion, by which wee may get knowledge how to prevent the danger of eternall death: who can tell what ſcant and thinne times may come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, in which we may feele a ſore famine of the Word, and not be able to get inſtruction and exhortation, which now wee have in abundance?</p>
            <p>Let us ſtore our heart with knowledge, now in theſe times of plenty, that our ſoules may not periſh for want of true knowledge: &amp; then when the means of knowledge ſhall be diminiſhed, make uſe of Gods goodneſſe, that you periſh not for want of true knowledg: Yea the Lord in his Word hath plainely revealed his minde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the damnation of impenitent ſinners, and ſalvation of the penitent. O now labour to get repentance in theſe happy ſeaſons of Repentance, wherein God offers grace unto you, and put not off theſe great workes till after uncertaine times, when no more meanes of repentance ſhall be granted, then the Aegyptians had of getting corn, in the ſeven yeeres of deadly famine; uſe the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of getting grace, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did of getting Corne.

            <p>Thirdly, you ſhall ſee in Joſephs carriage great humility,<note place="margin">3.

ſaith, <hi>it is not in me, God ſhall give Pharaoh an anſwer of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee ſee the ſame humility in <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he did likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the dreames of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 2.30.</note> for he ſaith expreſſely, <hi>as for mee, this ſecret is not revealed unto me for any wiſedome that I have more then any living.</hi> Loe he depreſſeth himſelfe, and gives the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God, wee muſt learne to beſtow Gods gifts humbly, not vaine-gloriouſly, and with oſtentation, ſetting up our ſelves, but humbly acknowledging our owne meaneneſſe, muſt give God the honour, and labour our ſelves to be made inſtruments of good to men, by thoſe indowments, wherewith the Lord ſhall enrich us.</p>
            <p>Humility adorneth and beautifieth all graces, it is this Vertue that addeth luſtre to all graces, and commendeth him in whom it is, more then all his abilities beſides: but vaine glory and oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and ſelfe conceitedneſſe, and vaunting ones ſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puſſed up, doth as it were ſoyle and ſullie, and defile and dawb all gifts, and maketh him, in whom they worke this effect, as loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and contemptible, as if he wanted all of them, learne not to exalt your ſelves, that God may exalt you.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. He ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and due reſpect to the King.</note>Another thing to be noted in Joſeph, hee ſhew'd all reverence and due reſpect to the King, as <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo did, giving him dutifull words, and carrying himſelfe ſubmiſſively: ſo muſt we doe when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we approach before Rulers and Kings, our words and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures muſt bee decent and reſpective, tending to expreſſe an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable eſteeme of them, becauſe of the Image of Gods Majeſty and greatneſſe, which ſhineth in them. Joſeph would not come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in the ſordid garments of his priſon houſe, nor with the haire of the dungeon, but polleth himſelfe, and getteth on bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attire, and ſets himſelfe in all his carriage to honour the King, ſaying, <hi>God hath ſhewed Pharaoh, what he is about to doe, and God will anſwer for Pharaohs peace.</hi> Oh that we could learne mannerly, and dutifull, and reſpective carriage towards Princes and Superiours, even for conſcience ſake to God.</p>
            <p>How frequently doth the Scripture mention the good carriage of godly men to Kings, they bowed to them with their faces to the ground, they worſhipped them, they gave them fit titles, and did not thinke it much to ſtoope lowe unto them, as we ſee in the ſtories of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Woe unto them therefore that deſpiſe governement, ſpeake evill of dignities, and ſlight thoſe whom God hath advanced, no thing but fooliſh pride, and a want, as it were, of ſeeing Gods face, in theſe his Vice-gerents, hath emboldned them to contemptuous words, and carriages: Yea, you muſt know, that not alone to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, Potentates, and great Commanders in the World, this reverend carriage is due, but to all Governours in their ſeverall, though farre lower places, ſeeing all the places are of God, and not only the higheſt powers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:27208:246"/>Therefore to inferiour Magiſtrates, to husbands. Fathers, Maſters, doth the Scripture call for Reverence, and whoſoever is bold to deſpiſe inferiour Governours, doth not for any Conſcience appear reverend to the higher powers, but alone out of carnall ſeare and ſiniſter reſpects. Ah, repent of your irreverent, diſdainefull, and intemperate behaviour towards, Governours, and now learne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your fear of the great Ruler of all things, by ſhewing fear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all thoſe for his ſake, whom hee hath binne pleaſed to ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you.</p>
            <p>Another point of faithfulneſſe, reſpect and loyalty,<note place="margin">2. After his preferment, he was alſo faithfull and loyall to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh.</hi>
               </note> Joſeph alſo ſhewd to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of Aegypt, after his advancement, hee did not ſend for his Brethren, nor place them without the licenſe of the King, nor would take his journey after to bury his Father til he had attained the Kings good leave. So muſt al Princes, high Officers, and Nobles under a King, ſhew themſelves ſo loyall and reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the King, as to do no matter of weight, but by his licenſe and direction, neither muſt they advance their friends and kindred, nor ſhew reſpect unto them otherwiſe, then with due ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſubjection to the Kings authority and will. Kings muſt bee honoured, reſpected, obeyed; and all faithfulneſſe muſt be ſhewed towards them; the ſafety of a Kingdome is upheld by the reſpect declared unto him, whom God hath made head of it.</p>
            <p>Let all that would ſhew themſelves to feare God, be carefull to follow Joſeph in thus honouring the Royall Majeſty, we muſt not wrong them, nor ſlight them, nor preſume too much on them, nor advance thoſe we like, with injury to them.</p>
            <p>Joſephs carriage after his preferment, in other reſpects was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſeeing his great wiſedome, is ſo taken with it, that he makes him the chiefe ruler over the Land of Aegypt, and giving him his ring from his owne hand, makes him the chiefe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler under him, as you would ſay, the Lord Chancelor of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Aegypt.</p>
            <p>Now in this great office,<note place="margin">

Paul</hi> ſpeaketh it, eſpecially of eccleſiaſticall offices, it is true alſo of civill: as Joſeph in this matter did diſcharge the truſt repoſed in him, ſo doe you in all places whereto you ſhall be called: if any man be prefer'd to any place of command in Church or common-weale, he is as much tyed to undergoe the labour of the workes of that place, as Joſeph was to this of collecting corne: and he that in his place is careleſſe, negligent, or unfaithfull, ſinnes againſt God and his owne ſoule, and the common-weale; therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle bids us, <hi>not to be ſloathfull in buſineſſe.</hi> We muſt not ſuffer our ſelves to waxe weary of the paines, and be tyred with the workes of our callings, in ſuch places, but by a conſcionable conſideration of Gods Providence, in ſetting us in ſuch places, wee muſt quicken our ſelves againſt all dulneſſe and weariſomneſſe. This ſhall be an honour to a man, before thoſe that are truly wiſe and judicious, for not the poſſeſſing of a place of power, but the due diſcharge of it is a credit unto men.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Magiſtratus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum indicat:</note>The worſt and moſt unworthy man, may be lifted up on high, as was <hi>Haman,</hi> but it is a proofe of true vertue to doe the worke of the place, fitly, as did <hi>Daniel</hi> when <hi>Cyrus</hi> advanced him to bee the third Ruler in the Kingdome. This alſo ſhall comfort the heart of a man, when that time commeth that hee muſt give an account to God, and his conſcience, of his behaviour in his place: for you muſt conſider brethren, that every man from the loweſt to the higheſt muſt give an account of his ſtewardſhip, and then, not the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that he hath poſſeſſed, nor the great ſtate hee hath gotten, ſhall cheare up his ſoul, but his faithfull and conſcionable diſcharge of his duty.</p>
            <p>Set up Joſephs practice therefore before your eyes, and follow him, that God may honour you at the laſt day, as Joſeph is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Book of God. But another thing is to be learned hence, even a point of prudence and good husbandry, that is, to lay up the overplus of great abundance, againſt a time of ſcarcity. This was wiſe counſell of Joſeph, and wiſely followed by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and by Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph executed. It is not alone lawfull, but needful and uſeful, when God doth ſend great ſtore of corne, or any like commodity, that may be fitly kept in ſtore, then to reſerve ſome part of the plenty for a future time, when perhaps there ſhal be no ſuch plenty: wee muſt not ſpend al the ſtore of a plenteous yeere; it is not for mee to counſell States and Princes, but it is fit that every man bee wiſe for himſelfe, as well as a King for his Kingdome. The proverbe for a wiſe and good proverbe, that ſaith, <hi>when a thing is cheape, lay it on a heape.</hi> Such hoording is no oppreſſion, but good husbandry, hee whom God hath furniſh't with means, ſhal doe well in doing ſo. To force a dearth by ingroſſing, by making things dear, when they are in one hand, when a man inriches himſelf with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon loſſe, this is a ſinne, and an act of covetouſneſſe; but to provide, in laying up the ſurpluſage of Plenty, is a thing to be commended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:27208:247"/>It were good that men of ability would deale thus wiſely, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for their privat, but alſo for the publike good, <hi>the piſmire layes up in ſummer,</hi> man ſhould bee wiſer then a ſilly creeping thing: oh how fooliſh and naught be thoſe, that when they get much, ſpend all, and reſerve nothing for harder times?

Moſt juſt it is that they ſhould be pinched in a deare yeare, which laviſhed and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted in a plentiful.</p>
            <p>Brethren, you muſt not alwayes have ſuch yeeres, as will bring forth by handfuls, be wiſe therefore for our eſtates, I wiſh you not to be niggardly, and defraud your ſelves, but to bee diſcreet, and lay up for yourl ſelves: if God ſend no more then is needfull, ſpend it and truſt his providence, if he ſend an overplus, ſo much I mean as will ſerve for the preſent, and ſome to ſpare, waſte not all at the preſent, but know that now he calleth to ſtoring up, remember <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Proverb, <hi>in the houſe of the wiſe is treaſure and oile, but the foole conſumeth it up.</hi> Be not fooles, but in plenty remember dearth, as in dearth you wiſh for plenty, you know that by well, husbanding of plenty, a wiſe man ſhould take ſuch an order, that he may feele no dearth.

And ſo much for one part of Joſephs care, diligence and fidelity in gathering corne.</p>

            <p>See in them the fault of improvident careleſſeneſſe, whereof we ſpake before: but note Joſephs faithfulneſſe; hee doth open the ſtore-houſes, now that pinching want began to bite them, and ſels them Corne. It is fit that men in dearth, ſhould bring out and ſell Corne, if they have it, and not to ſuffer their neighbours to ſtarve for want of that, which themſelves have in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>

A thing muſt bee eſteemed worth ſo much, and may bee ſold for ſo much as the preſent dearth doth make it worth, and in ſuch caſe he doth not wrong, that takes the preſent times; onely note, that Joſeph did not oppreſſe the poore, but they had of him as well as the rich, the one gave all, and the other could give but all, and both had neceſſaries, ſo ſhould it be done in hard times by publike charity.

Before he carried himſelfe ſtrangely with a kind of admixture of anger and love, that they might be driven to wonder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo be drawne to repentance. His harſh dealings are theſe. 1. He takes them for ſpies, and will not intertaine better thoughts of them, though they gave him a ſatisfying reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were the <hi>ſonnes of one man,</hi> and it was never heard of, that one man would venture tenne ſonnes at once upon ſuch a dangerous buſineſſe, as that of going to ſpy out a nation, yet becauſe they ſaid they were twelve brethren, and one was not, and the youngeſt was with their Father, hee continued to charge this crime upon them, making exceptions againſt them, as if they had contradicted themſelves in their ſpeech.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he will be ſatisfied by nothing elſe,<note place="margin">2. Hee ſends one of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to fetch their younger brother, the reſt remaining priſoners till he came.</note> but by ſending one of them to fetch their younger brother, the reſt remaining priſoners till he came. Little did <hi>Ioſeph</hi> thinke how burdenſome a thing it would be with <hi>Iacob</hi> to part with <hi>Benjamin,</hi> but this hee doth alone to have occaſion of keeping them longer in hold, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:27208:249"/>
they might have leaſure enough to repent, and therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. He kept them in priſon three dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note>Thirdly, he kept them in priſon three dayes all together. This was harſh dealing at their firſt comming downe, yet here he ſhewes ſome kindneſſe betwixt, <hi>viz.</hi> in that on the third day hee calls them forth, and takes pity of them, propounding to them an eaſie condition, <hi>viz.</hi> That one of them ſhould remaine bound, and the reſt ſhould returne with corne for their families, and bring their younger brother thither: now he ſhewes love alſo in going away, weeping, when he heard them talking of their ſinne, and confeſſing that for that cauſe this croſſe came on them; But it was ſome matter of hardneſſe, that he tooke <hi>Simeon</hi> and bound him, becauſe he was the eldeſt next to <hi>Ruben,</hi> and was preſent when he was ſold, but did not labour to ſave him from ſelling, as <hi>Reuben</hi> ſaved him from kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,<note place="margin">Another act of kindneſſe to them was, that he commanded their ſacks to be filled with corne, and that their money ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to them.</note> wherefore he forbare to take and bind <hi>Reuben.</hi> Another act of kindneſſe to them was, that hee commanded their ſackes to be filled with corne, and the mony alſo to be reſtored unto them, which he did of purpoſe to put them in a fit of wondring and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſtill they might be furthered in the worke of repentance, which he perceived was begunne in them.</p>
            <p>Now at their ſecond comming up, hee ſhewes nothing to them almoſt but kindneſſe, ſaving in one thing, whereby hee caſts them ſeemingly into a great danger, that hee might thoroughly humble them, and try them before he revealed himſelfe unto them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he invites them all to dinner with him. 2. He entertaineth their preſent, and talketh lovingly with them of their Father, asking how he doth, and ſalutes <hi>Benjamin,</hi> towards whom hee was ſo affected, that he haſts to weepe, being hardly able to forbeare, till he could ſtep into a corner to doe it there. Laſtly, hee carries himſelfe moſt cheerefully with them at dinner, placing them in the order of their age, and ſending them meſſes from his owne table, and ſending five times as much to <hi>Benjamin</hi> as to any of them. All which hee ſeemeth to have done to have brought them to ſome knowledge of himſelfe, if it had beene poſſible.</p>
            <p>Another thing is by hiding his cup in <hi>Benjamins</hi> ſacke, he cauſeth them to be brought backe againe as it were guilty of theft, and then ſeemes to be much diſpleaſed at ſuch ill dealing, and would hold <hi>Benjamin</hi> in priſon, till <hi>Iudahs</hi> Oration melted him, and then with much ſecrecy and great affectionateneſſe he ſhewes himſelfe to them plainely, and weepes over them, and comforts their aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſpirits.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Some acts of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> carriage were doubtfull and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</note>Now many particulars of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> carriage are ſomwhat doubtfull &amp; extraordinary, and we cannot tell what to ſay of them, <hi>viz.</hi> his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of them to be ſpies, when he knew they were not, and his pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king quarrels with their anſwer, and impriſoning them, and then cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his cup to be hid in one of their ſacks, and ſo bringing them into the guilt of theft cauſeleſſely. But all this was done in ſeeming, only
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:27208:249"/>
to bring them to thorough repentance for their ſin, which when hee perceived by <hi>Iudahs</hi> ſpeech and all their carriage, that it was effected, then he ſhewes himſelfe to them ſpeedily.</p>
            <p>The thing we muſt imitate is this, to uſe all care of bringing thoſe that are neere to us, to repentance for their faults, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing ſeaſonable ſharpnes and kindneſſe, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
            <p>Againe, it may ſeeme to be lawfull by the example of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in way of probation and tryall, to counterfeit diſcontent, and to lay grievous things to the charge of men, and preſſe them as if they were guilty, though one know the contrary: I ſtill ſay, if it be done by way of tryall, ſo that at laſt it be made manifeſt, that it was meerely in tryall, and that which would ſeeme a lye, if it were affirmed expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not with reference to ſuch an end, being ſaid to ſuch an end is not a lye, becauſe it is indeed not an affirming, but a ſeeming to affirme for a time. For in ſuch a caſe a mans words doe not differ from his mind and meaning, but alone he conceales his meaning for a time. So <hi>Salomon</hi> ſeemed angry, and commanded to divide the child betwixt the two wrangling harlots that came before him, our Saviour made as if he would have gone further, when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had him in with them at <hi>Emmaus.</hi> So if a Judge ſeeing great probability, and in a manner certainty of the guiltineſſe of an offendour, ſhall affirme ſomething to him, to draw a confeſſion from him, as for example, that ſome companion of his hath confeſt it, and that it is in vaine for him any longer to deny, or that he was ſeene at ſuch time in ſuch a place, by ſuch and ſuch, when indeed theſe things were not ſo, but ſomewhat equivalent to them, was true, <hi>viz.</hi> Arguments convincing their guiltineſſe, even as much as theſe things would, though not to make them confeſſe. I ſay ſuch courſes taken by way of probation and tryall, and finding out guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are not to be eſteemed lyes, becauſe here the meaning is to be taken according to that which ſhall be ſhortly diſcovered, and not according to the preſent ſhew of words. Theſe be but a kind of ironicall carryage, no more lies then an irony, that by affirming one thing in ſuch and ſuch a manner and geſture, doth affirme the quite contrary. But to doe thus in way of excuſing or hiding a fault, and keeping ones ſelfe from the knowledge of a Governour, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſinfull and naught, and muſt not be allowed.</p>
            <p>Take heed that you doe not imbolden your ſelves to deny, and to ſhift them off from your Superiours examining you, becauſe you ſee <hi>Ioſeph</hi> trying his brethren, by talking with them, ſo as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent he meant not as he ſaid.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> made it evident,<note place="margin">He forgate all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns wrongs.</note> that he had forgotten all his brethrens wrongs, and therefore uſeth them exceeding kindly, for he weeps over them, and comforts them, bidding them not to bee ſorry that they had ſold him, and he ſends for their families, and gives them gifts, and maintaines them and their families, and ſets
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27208:250"/>
ſome of them before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and prevailes to get them the Land of <hi>Goſhen</hi> to dwell in, and after their Fathers death when they ſend and come to him, he uſeth them with all kindneſſe, weeping and comforting them, as is manifeſt in the ſtory. So that he had utterly forgotten all wrongs, and loves them no whit leſſe now that they have repented, then if they had never ſinned.</p>
            <p>Hence we muſt learne the duty of Brothers one to another, even to communicate their wealth one to another, and the richer to help to maintaine the poore in caſe of dearth or want, or any hand of God afflicting and diſtreſſing them.</p>
            <p>Indeed if any bring want upon themſelves, abler kinſmen are not bound to provide for them that ſpend it on their luſts; if they will ſerve the Devill with what they have, let them be pinched, no man is to pity them in ſuch caſe. But when Gods hands brings affliction, when they frame to good courſes, then they are to be helped by thoſe of their kindred that are of ability. And one able perſon ſhould improve his wealthineſſe to the helping and inri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of thoſe that be poorer, and to their maintenance in their neceſſity as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did, elſe they are guilty of wanting naturall affection, and of great uncharitableneſſe.</p>
            <p>Further you ſee, that when men have truely repented of their ſinnes, be they never ſo great, their ſinnes muſt be forgotten, and they muſt be accepted and regarded, even as if they had never ſinned. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is as loving to his brethren, as if they had beene the honeſteſt men in the world, becauſe now they were truly changed. So ſhould men be to the greateſt offendours, when a ſound and thorough reformation and amendment ſhewes it ſelfe in their lives. Till ſinnes be amended, it is not requiſite to ſhew ſuch reſpect, but when they be amended. Therefore every ſinner ſhould haſten to amend, that he might repaire his broken eſtimation, and regaine the love which he hath loſt with good and wiſe men. And thoſe muſt not pleaſe themſelves in their folly, that to a man truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, are ſtill objecting and upbrayding former evill deeds. Herein they ſhew not the deteſtation of the vices, but wrath and diſcontent againſt the perſons, and are farre unlike to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who doth blot the ſinnes of his converting children out of his remembrance, and that ſo, as if they commit them no more, he will no more remember them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">He was eaſie to pardon.</note>Againe, in <hi>Ioſephs</hi> carryage to his brethren, we ſee how eaſie he was to pardon, for though he ſhewed himſelfe rough at firſt, yet that was not out of a revengefull paſſion, but out of a deſire to bring them to repentance for their ſinnes, for he knew they had beene very wild and faulty in their youth; but he ſtill ſhewes love and kindneſſe, notwithſtanding the hatred that they ſhewed to him, and he ſees God in it, and would have them ſee God in it, and ſo comforts them, and pacifieth himſelfe. All good men muſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him in this, forgive and forget huge, great, and enormous injuries.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:27208:250"/>
If one have gone about to deprive us of our liberty, our goods, of our lives, yea have not alone gone about it, but effected it ſo much as in him lay, and after fals into our hands, ſo that we may if we will revenge our ſelves of him, yet we muſt not yeeld our ſelves to thoughts of revenge, but muſt doe good againſt evill, eſpecially if a neere kinſman or brother have ſo forgotten himſelfe, yet muſt not we ſo farre forget our ſelves, as to requite like for like, evils with evils, but muſt doe them all the good we can, and blot their faults out of our minds. Our Saviour teacheth this in the Parable; you know, he that hath beene forgiven the 1000 Talents, as all of us have, muſt be eaſily perſwaded to forgive the hundred pence. And this will make us forgive and forget our brethrens offences, if we frequently remember our owne, to admire the goodneſſe of God, that ſo graciouſly doth pardon us. If any therefore find themſelves apt to remember and requite wrongs, yea petty ſmall wrongs, nothing ſo high as theſe of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren, they muſt blame the greatneſſe of their ſtomacks, and condemne that rancour which ſwelleth within them as a great fault, ſhewing, that they have not well conſidered the love that God ſhewed to man-kind in Chriſt, to forgive iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſinne. And now learne all of you this excellent vertue, ſtrive to be of a ſweet, and a mild, and an amiable nature, ready to paſſe by great injuries, to ſhew great kindneſſe againſt great unkindneſſe, and to overcome bad with good. This is a thing well pleaſing to God, and ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the conſcience in the day of any affliction, more then all the riches in the world. Revenge taſts ſweet in the doing, but after, it ſhall lade the conſcience with terrours; paſſing by faults, loving enemies, doing good to thoſe which have done us evill, be hid things to the fleſh and blood, and ſeeme difficult in the practiſe, but the remembrance of them after, ſhall afford unſpeakeable content.</p>
            <p>I have ſpoken of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> good deeds in ſome part, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe that he ſhewed in his Fathers houſe, and ſome of thoſe that he ſhewed in Egypt, <hi>viz.</hi> In his private eſtate, both in his Maſters houſe, and his priſon houſe, and in his publike eſtate before his advancement to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in reſpect of his dreames, and after his advancement to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to the Egyptians and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>

            <p>Now follow the croſſes and benefits which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had. His affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were many, 1. The hatred of his brethren which proceeded from envy. 2.

            <p>Secondly his Benefits.<note place="margin">His Benefits.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord beſtowed upon him a great number of Benefits.</p>
            <p>Firſt ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>Secondly Naturall.</p>
            <p>Firſt for ſpirituall.<note place="margin">1. Spirituall. He did pertake of the Holy Ordinances, and was made holy by them.</note> The Lord was exceeding gracious to his ſoule, not only giving him the outward Ordinances, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in his Fathers houſe, then the Church of God, for then the forme of the Church-Governement was domeſticall, where hee had ſacrifices, circumciſion, and teaching by the Prophets of God. viz. His Grand-Father <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and his Father <hi>Iacob,</hi> for <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack</hi> lived till he was of yeares fit for teaching; but alſo vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing by theſe Ordinances to worke Faith, and true holineſſe in his heart, ſo that he was an heire of the righteouſneſſe of faith, and partaker of the promiſes made to his Fore-fathers. And this is the greateſt of benefits that can be granted a man in this life, even to cauſe him ſo to live in the Church, as to become an holy man, that is a true member of the ſame.</p>
            <p>So God dealt with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and at laſt alſo with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Patriarchs, <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes, and Joſephs Brethren; but he ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Ioſeph betime, and let his Brethren runne on a longer time, in the courſe of unregeneracie. Wherefore beloved brethren, let each of us ſo looke upon the goodneſſe of God to Ioſeph, as to conſider whether himſelfe have attained the ſame favour, even to bee ſanctified, and to bee made a true believer, an holy man, a Saint of God, wee muſt bee Saints in this life, if eVer we hope to come to theſe fellowſhip of Saints hereafter.</p>
            <p>If any of you finde himſelfe to bee converted, and ſee that GOD hath dealt very favourably with him, as with Ioſeph, and that perhaps alſo in his Childe-hood, and Youth; let him enlarge himſelfe in thankes, and ſtirre up his heart to bleſſe the great and Holy Name of GOD, for this benefit, and the greateſt of all benefits, and let him prize and eſteeme this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, at a high rate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:27208:252"/>Secondly, the Lord having made him good, did confirme him in his goodneſſe,<note place="margin">2. He was confirmed in goodneſſe.</note> for that hee was not turned out of the wayes of Righteouſneſſe, by all the changes and alterations that befell him.</p>
            <p>His fathers indeed exceſſive and ſomewhat fond affection, did not make him waxe conceited, and ſo decline to evill wayes, and waxe worſe than before. The envy and hatred of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren could not make him forſake the trade of piety, and joyn with them in their diſordered courſes. His ſervice in <hi>Putiphars</hi> idolatrous houſe, nor his preferment there could not alter him. His Miſtreſſes love and ſolicitations did not change him, nor the irons eating in his ſoule, did not diminiſh goodneſſe in him; nay his high and ſudden preferment in Aegypt, did not make him forget God, and turne either an Aegyptian idolater, or a wicked man: but Joſeph was Joſeph ſtill, in all his toſſings and tumblings of his eſtate; if you be ſtill good in all eſtates, adverſe and proſperous as JOSEPH was, magnifie Gods grace, that hath eſtabliſhed you in every good word and work,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.17.</note> and confeſſe that you have ſtood by his power:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.10.</note> but if any have declined or back ſlided from his goodneſſe, let him ſee his miſery, and doe his firſt workes,<note place="margin">Ier. 3.22.</note> returning to God, who calleth back-ſliders, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to heale their back-ſliding.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Naturall.</note>So much for Ioſephs ſpirituall benefits, now for the naturall benefits.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <p n="1">1. In Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
                  <p>Gen. 39.2.23. He was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous man. 1. Iob.</p>
               </note>And firſt in generall. He was a proſperous man, and God made all he did to proſper, both in <hi>Putiphars</hi> houſe, and in the Priſon. So God proſpered <hi>David</hi> where ever hee went, and <hi>Iob</hi> too for a while; this brings contentment to a mans ſelfe, and getteth him a good eſteeme from others.</p>
            <p>See therefore whether God vouchſafe you this mercy, aſcribe the praiſe of your proſperity to him, and let this goodneſſe allure you to love, feare and obey him, to ſeeke his honour, and to doe all good with that proſperity of thine, but if contrarily, God croſſeth any of you, and ſets himſelfe againſt you ſo, that nothing thrives with you; ſee Gods hand that doth walke contrary to you, and finde out the cauſe, and turne this adverſity, into an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the greateſt proſperity.</p>
            <p>There is a ſanctified adverſity, as well as curſed proſperity, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to feare God, and walke in uprightneſſe before him, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeme earthly things.<note place="margin">2. More particularly.</note> And ſo much for his generall good eſtate, more particularly.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him out of heavy and grievous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</note>Firſt God delivered him out of ſore, heavy, and grievous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and by his ſpeciall providence, and in a manner, more then ordinary.</p>
            <p>Firſt when his Father ſent him to his Brethren, he loſt himſelfe wandring about, and knew not where to go, then God cauſed a man
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:27208:252"/>
to meet him, that it may ſeeme did know him, and told him where he ſhould finde his Brethren.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when his Brethren conſulted to take away his life, God raiſed up <hi>Reuben</hi> to deliver him, and when they thought after to have diſpatcht him, the Merchants came by, and ſo God took them off then; when he was in bondage, God inclined <hi>Putiphars</hi> heart towards him, and his Maſters likewiſe in the priſon, and laſtly, the Butler remembred him when he had long lien there, and by that meanes God brought him out of the priſon, and advanced him to be chiefe Officer in Aegypt.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee ſtrange and happy eſcapes out of miſery, ſo that Joſeph might well have called God by the ſame title, that his old Father Jacob did, the God that delivered his ſoule out of all adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as <hi>David</hi> alſo intitles him. Hath God ſtrangely alſo delivered you out of great miſeries, either from keeping them from falling upon you, when in all likelihood they muſt have come, or in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, when your ſelves could ſee no way out? if ſo, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gods Providence and goodneſſe, and forget not him in your good eſtate, that remembred you in your low eſtate: let thoſe that are in miſery, learne to caſt themſelves upon God, as Joſeph did, ſubmit, be patient, truſt in him.</p>
            <p>The Lord in bringing his ſervants into calamities, aymes at their bettering by them, and his Glory, in their deliverances: learne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience therefore and confidence. So you ſee how God pulled him out of evils.</p>
            <p>Next conſider what good things hee ſtored him withall,<note place="margin">2. He laded him with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</note> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he laded him with benefits, as it is in the Pſalme. And to begin with the gifts of his mind.</p>
            <p>Firſt the Lord gave him that extraordinary gift of interpreting Dreames, even from his childehood almoſt,<note place="margin">1. God gave him the gift of interpreting Dreames.</note> with which hee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>Daniel</hi> too, and made it a meanes of great preferment to them both.</p>
            <p>You know how readily hee could tell the Butler and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, what was meant by three vine branches, three dayes, and the wringing of them into <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Cup, and giving them into, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hand, the reſtoring of him againe unto his office. So in the Dream of the other ſervant of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> 3. Baskets are three dayes, the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of meat out of the higheſt by the foules upon his head, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the devouring of his fleſh by birds, after that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him on the third day. So for <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Dreames, the number of the kine, and eares of corne 7, and 7, ſignifying each ſeven yeeres, the quality of the kine and eares, full and good eares, with fat, fleſhie, and well favoured kine, plentifull yeares; thin, blaſted, and empty eares, with leane ill fleſhed and ill favoured kine, yeares of famine. The eating up of the fat and goodly by the leane, the utter forgetting of the paſt abundance, by the following of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and the number of dreames.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:27208:253"/>Secondly, the certainty and neere approaching of the things which was to bee. ſurely and inſtantly fulfilled. You ſee how apt theſe dreames were to ſignifie theſe things, and when God gave to Joſeph the ſpirit of interpretation, how eaſie the interpretation is, and how fit and handſome, as it were, all things ſorting ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably for ſuch a meaning. Doubtleſſe this interpretation by its owne cleareneſſe, and fitneſſe, did carry the credit of truth with, it. Now at thoſe times, when God did pleaſe to make Dreames an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of his, for the revealing of things neceſſary, it was a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall favour of his to give the power of interpreting them too, for what is a dreame if it be not interpreted, but a meanes of perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoughts and feares? Now God that gave power to ſhew the meaning of Dreames, when Dreames were his Ordinance, is able alſo to give the gift of interpreting his Word unto men, ſeeing the Word is now his Ordinance, for the revealing of all truth to men, needfull to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>We muſt beſeech God to powre gifts upon his ſervants now, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to give unto his Miniſters skill and will, to become faithfull interpreters of his Word; and if God do give to any an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gift this way, let him be thankfull to God, and uſe it for their good that need it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Great wiſedome in mannaging any buſineſſe.</note>Another gift of his mind, was great wiſedome and dexterity to mannage any buſineſſe committed to his charge: You ſee how hee diſpatched matters in the great houſhold of <hi>Putiphar</hi> ſo, that they perceived, that all things went well, which could not have bin ſo, if the perſon that ordered all, had not had an excellent head to guide them; and after, when he was in priſon, by little and little his Maſter found out his excellent ſufficiencies, to doe any worke, and therefore, as the former maſter did, ſo hee intruſted him with all.<note place="margin">Where ſhall we finde one wiſe like this?</note> And when from ordering a family, he came to order the whole Kingdome of Aegypt, he underwent that buſie and toileſome work with ſo much diſcretion, as gave the King and all his people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſo that to Joſeph, <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſent them, and unto Joſeph they gladly repaired.</p>
            <p>It is a ſingular favour, when God gives one, as they call it, a <hi>good Head-piece,</hi> an aptneſſe and fitneſſe, to contrive matters diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, and to order them prudently, as it is ſaid of the Deputy in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that he was <hi>a prudent man,</hi> one that could reſolve and execute well, and ſquare out fit meanes for each end, and follow it accordingly.</p>
            <p>This wiſedome as well as other Learning, was given to DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIEL, and to SOLOMON, and to many good men, and the ſame was found out alſo in ACHITOPHEL and in bad men. It is not a gift of holineſſe proper to thoſe who muſt bee ſaved, but a gift which the LORD ſees fitte for the common benefit of Man-kinde, to beſtow upon wicked and unſanctified men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:27208:253"/>Indeed many times God chooſeth, rather the ſimple heads of the world, then theſe nimble and deepe pates, that it may appeare 'tis of his grace, and not of nature, that men bee godly and vertuous. But an excellent gift it is, and makes way for their preferment in worldly things that have it, but let them which have it take heed of ſuffering it to degenerate into Craft, for then it will become pernitious.</p>
            <p>Craft is naturall wiſedome, ſeparated from Juſtice, Truth,<note place="margin">Craft, what it is.</note> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and other graces, and joyned with falſehood, injuriouſneſſe, and ſelfe-love, as it were a weapon in the hands of Traytors, a fort poſſeſſed by Rebels, by which they doe make warre againſt their Prince.</p>
            <p>Againe, take heed that you waxe not proud of this gift, but ſtir up your ſelves to bleſſe God for it, and make uſe of it for the good and benefit of ſimpler heads, and not only for your particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and let men be carefull to beg, not onely naturall, but ſpirituall wiſedome of God, both are promiſed by him.</p>
            <p>Thus farre of his gifts of minde, I goe on to ſpeake of externall gifts, I meane the good things that were without himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that where ever he came, hee was eſteemed, loved,<note place="margin">3. Where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he came, he was eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, loved, truſted.</note> truſted. His Father loved him above all his Brethren, and eſteemed more of him, then of them all, and put confidence in him, ſo that he believed his reports of his Brethren, and obſerved his dreames: his Maſter <hi>Putiphar,</hi> the Aegyptian, loved him above all his ſervants, and truſted him with all his eſtate, and had him in great account: putting all into his hand: his miſtreſſe eſteemed him, but too much, and loved him too much, and durſt truſt him, with her name and honour, in the caſe you know of; then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> truſted him with his ring, and the command of all Aegypt, and imployed him in that moſt important affaire of providing and ſelling Corne, and what eſtimation he had with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is evident, and what love, when for his ſake he ſo reſpected his Father and Brethren as to give them the land of <hi>Goſhen</hi> for a poſſeſſion, the people alſo they loved and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him exceedingly, and even put their lives and lands and all into his hands.</p>
            <p>A man more affected, reſpected and eſteemed, then Joſeph in his time, no ſtory can name; it is a ſingular thing to bee loved, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, truſted, accounted, not only a wiſe, but a juſt, good, worthy man, and to have the good wils of men attending him alwayes. So it was with <hi>David,</hi> all loved and honoured him, but he which ſhould have honoured him moſt, his father in Law, <hi>Saul.</hi> let all ſtrive by ſhewing all Joſephs vertues, to get the good will, as of God, ſo of men, that they may be capable of doing and receiving ſo much more good, by how much he hath more command in the hearts of men.</p>
            <p>Indeed Gods people have lived ſometimes amongſt ſo evill perſons, and in ſo evill dayes, that their vertues have begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hatred and reproach; but if mens practice be not evill, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27208:254"/>
times be not very bad, good carriage will get good will and good eſteeme, be not ſo farre carried with mens words and liking, as to condeſcend to their ſinfull courſes; for the attaining thereof, but ſo farre, as faithfull, wiſe, loving and vertuous behaviour will win men, every man ſhould labour and ſeek to procure the affections of others.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. He had great outward preferment.</note>Secondly, Joſeph had great outward preferment, he was made a chiefe Commander and Counſellor of State in Aegypt, to teach <hi>his Senators wiſedome,</hi> as is in the Pſalmes, and withall hee had an heart given him to uſe his preferment well, for the common bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of mankind, and opportunity too, to uſe it for the particular good of his father and family, and for the preſervation of the Church.</p>
            <p>To be preferred unto a place of great honour and authority, is a thing that moſt mens eyes doe gaze after, and ambitiouſly wiſh and ſeeke after; but to have it caſt upon man, by God, for his good deſervings, and then to be ſo bleſſed in it, as to make it a meanes of benefitting many, eſpecially the Church of God, this is a great benefit.</p>
            <p>So did <hi>Heſter</hi> uſe her preferment, and <hi>Mordecay</hi> his, ſo <hi>Daniel</hi> his, ſo <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> theirs: you are not likely any of you, to come to very high place, yet who can tell perhaps, there may bee ſome young ſcholler or other amongſt you, that may come to high place; let me ſpeake ſuch a word to him now, that may come into his heart hereafter and doe him good. If you be advanced, ſtrive to doe good to the Common-Weale, and let the Nation fare the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you: ſtrive to do good to your kindred, &amp; the Church, though the Church may not conſiſt onely of your family.</p>
            <p>Honour and great titles, and offices, will be but like a high gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, to expoſe men unto diſgrace, if they be uſed at the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of ſelfe-love, and other vices, bat happy is, and ſhall he be, that hath Joſephs preferment, and Joſephs heart to uſe it according to his example.</p>
            <p>But woe unto thoſe perſons which being lifted up to honour prove like a ſtone in a ſling to deſtroy many, and chiefely to batter downe vertue and piety and them that follow it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. He had a ſtrong and able body.</note>Thirdly for gifts of bodie, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had a ſtrong and able body, as appeares by his living to a 110 yeares old. This is a great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to them in whom it is found in the way of righteouſneſſe, live ſo, young men, that you may be capable of it: and you that are old, be thankefull if God have granted you it in the ſame manner as he did to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> even to be long in the world to enjoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the world as he did. For he was thirty yeares old at his preferment, &amp; therfore he lived in that flouriſhing honourful eighty yeares. A happy recompence for all the ſervice hee did to the Church of God, and for his true feare of God not offending him, to get his Miſtreſſe favour, and to riſe that way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:27208:254"/>For his miſery into which he ſeemed to caſt himſelfe by his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, was even a paire of ſtaires to lift him up into the place of honour, wherein the Lord cauſed him to continue eighty yeares. His goodneſſe in complaining of his brothers faults, made them hate him, his goodneſſe in denying his Miſtreſſes ſollicitations, made her hate him.</p>
            <p>Their hatred made him a ſlave, her hatred made him a priſoner, bondage and impriſonment brought him acquainted with the chiefe Butler, made himſelfe known to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and ſo brought him up to this exceeding height of place. Bleſſed be God for his goodneſſe to his people, no man ſhall hazard himſelfe to temporall miſery for conſcience ſake, but God will requite him with a hundred fold (at leaſt more comfort) here, as well as with life eternall hereafter. Let <hi>Ioſephs</hi> wages make you not afraid, ſo farre as you are called to it, to doe <hi>Ioſephs</hi> worke, that is, to ſay and doe good, and forbeare evill, though you incurre hatred and danger, and much affliction thereby.<note place="margin">6 Hee was bleſſed too in his poſterity.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was bleſſed too in his poſterity, to make his well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare up fully, he lived to ſee the ſonnes of <hi>Manaſseth</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> his two ſonnes, and he lived to ſee the part of the birth-right even the double portion conferred upon his children, and that by the mouth of his Father, inſpired by God, when he made his laſt will. <hi>Iacob</hi> adopted his two ſonnes to himſelfe to make two Tribes, and God made them both great, but eſpecially the younger he made him a principall Tribe for poſſeſſions, and command afterwards; and this alſo is ſome ſatisfaction to a Father, if he know that his children after him ſhall flouriſh for many generations.</p>
            <p>O that we could feare God and follow true vertue and piety as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did, that he might bleſſe us alſo as he did him, in our ſelves and poſterity, in our ſtate and our name, in our bodies, and in our ſoules, and in all that pertaineth to us according to his promiſe. And let all that feare God be aſſured, that ſo farre as is good for them, the Lord will give them proſperity in theſe things, for he made the ſame promiſes to all his people and will confirme them, ſo farre as they are capable, and it may ſtand with their ſpirituall good.</p>

            <p>For neither honours, nor favours, nor grace, nor any thing could keepe death away, and it muſt befall me, and you, and all that now live and are to live hereafter: onely marke that he dyed a godly and comfortable death, for in the cloze of his life, he made profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his being an Hebrew, not an Egyptian, by taking an oath of them for the carrying of his bones into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> gave them a promiſe of their returne thither which was alſo an exerciſe of his faith, to demonſtrate his comfortable expectation of life eternall, whereof the Land of Promiſe was a figure.

ignorant Brethren, that within the compaſſe of an hundred yeares a minute being compared to eternity, the whole number of you muſt be as well as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> dying and dead men. Be intreated to divorce your hearts from ſinne, the cauſe of death, from the world, which at death you muſt leave, and from men which cannot helpe you, neither in nor after death, and labour to get righteouſneſſe which will deliver from death, ſome aſſurance of heaven, that ye may have a place of comfort after death, and intereſt into Chriſt, who can ſave you from the hurt of death. And theſe things if you attaine, you may triumph over death with <hi>Pauls</hi> queſtion, <hi>Death where is thy sting?</hi> elſe death will triumph over you, with the queſtion of Chriſt, <hi>Whoſe then ſhall be theſe things of which thou glorieſt?</hi> So much of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>

               </note> for the Scripture giveth him no name at all.

a good ſervant hath good ſervants, and ſo in the reſt. Let this incourage you that be in the place of ſervants, to performe your duties diligently unto your domeſticall Rulers your Maſters, for by this meanes you may lay up for your ſelves, a comfortable hope of being ſerved with like care and diligence your ſelves. God no doubt hath a ſpeciall hand in diſpoſing of ſervants to every Maſter, it is he that ordereth things ſo, as ſuch a man hath good, and ſuch a one bad ſervants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men often uſe great care to chooſe a ſervant, and meete with a very bad one contrary to all their hopes and care, againe ſometimes by meere caſualty almoſt men light upon a very good ſervant.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <p>He was good to his Maſter and to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Teachable. Gen. 43.23.</p>
               </note>More particularly his carriage was good to his Maſter, and to the ſtrangers, brethren to his Maſter, but not by him knowne ſo to be. 1. Teachable, they learnt ſome knowledge of the true God from him. <hi>The God of your Fathers,</hi> ſaith he, and <hi>your God hath given you this treaſure.</hi> How came this man to know a diſtinction of Gods? How came he to know that they had a God of their owne, peculiar to them and to their Fathers, which was not then acknowledged to be the God of all the world? Egypt had many Gods, this man acknowledgeth one God, and that one God which was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and worſhipped by theſe men and by their Forefathers. It is not likely, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> told his Steward, that theſe were his brethren, but it is undoubtedly manifeſt, that they were ſome ſuch as he knew to be worſhippers of the true God, which hee knew by ſome few men, to be worſhipped in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Therefore you ſee how kindly he ſpeakes to them, that a man may even perceive by his words, that they were ſo much dearer to him, becauſe they pertained to that God. This was the more obſervable, becauſe he was an Egyptian ſervant; O that all you which be ſervants to godly Governours, would learne ſome goodneſſe from them, even to know and ſerve God; you all have ſome knowledge of that one God: but learne alſo the feare and love of that God, the ſincere and carefull worſhip of that God from your Governours, that would fain teach it you, and would count themſelves happy if you would learne it from them. But for a ſervant to live in the family of a <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> that laboureth to teach godlineſſe unto him by word and example, and yet declares no ſenſe nor feeling of God, no knowledge or reſpect of him, how great a ſinne is this, and how certainely ſhall this Steward of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> riſe up againſt ſuch in judgement?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. He was a very dutifull ſervant.</note>But ſecondly, <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſervant was a very obſequious and dutifull ſervant, whatſoever his Maſter bad him doe was preſently done, c. 42. ver. 25. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> commanded him to fill their ſackes with corne as much as they could carry, and to put every mans money into his ſackes mouths, and to put his ſilver cup in the youngeſt ſackes mouth, and his corne money, and he did according to his Maſters words, and c. 44.4. He bids him runne after them, and ſay, <hi>Why have you returned evill for good? is not this the cup in which my Lord

drinks,</hi> and <hi>for which he would make diligent ſearch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">That was an evill act and unlawfull.</note> for ſo I thinke it ſhould be rendred, for the matter of divining was farre enough from <hi>Ioſephs.</hi> Loe the obedience of this ſervant; he by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without Scripture, was taught to doe that, and did it, which the holy Scriptures teacheth us to doe, <hi>viz.</hi> to be obedient to our Maſters, as you reade by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſ.

               <hi>ſo is a ſloathfull meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to him that ſends him,</hi> and even ſo is a ſloathfull or careleſſe ſervant to them that imploy him: as vineger ſets the teeth an edge, ſmoak makes the eyes to mart, ſo theſe provoke anger and griefe in their Governours. Fulfill therefore the honeſt commandements of your Governours, with ſpeed and diligence, what things they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point you to diſpatch, let them be diſpatched in fit ſeaſon, and manner. If thou wert a Maſter thou wouldſt have ſuch a ſervant, be thou therfore ſuch a one, and do as thou wouldſt be done by. O but his Maſter (may ſome ſay) bad him doe that which was not lawfull, <hi>viz.</hi> To lay ſnares for the men, in putting the cup into <hi>Benjamins</hi> ſacke unawares to him, and then following after them with a grievous accuſation; that they had done great wrong, and ſhewed great ingratitude in taking away his Maſters cup, and ſo bringing them backe as if they had beene great malefactors. I anſwere, that it is probable, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had acquainted his Steward with his meaning, that he did this not with an intention of bringing them into ſervitude, or doing them any wrong, but making a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tryall of them for ſome conſideration, and ſo the thing was not ill done of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> nor of him. Let your obedience, therefore know its due limits, obey your Maſters in all things, ſo farre as juſtice and your duty to God will permit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. He was very kind curteous to <hi>Ioſephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</note> his carryage to <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren was very kind and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, he brings them to his Maſters houſe, ſpeakes comfortably to them, ſaith peace be to you, freeth them from their feares, wherewith they were perplexed, lifts up their hearts to God, and ſaith, he had given them that money, brings <hi>Simeon</hi> forth to them whom they had left bound behind, and gives them water to waſh their feet, and provender to their Cattle. Loe what ſtore of kindneſſe and courteſie he ſhewes to theſe ſtrangers? his Maſter appointed him to bring them to his houſe, but all the other kind uſage is from himſelfe as it were an over-plus, beſides that which was enjoyned him, out of a good and affable nature, and out of ſome good will he bare them, becauſe he had beene infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the God of their Fathers.</p>
            <p>Now let him be an Example to us, of practiſing like curteſie to ſtrangers, and ſpecially when we ſee them troubled and grieved, and moſt of all, if we perceive them to be ſervants to the true God,

learne that vertue of this Steward, though hee was a ſervant, and bond-man, yet it was to <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I finiſhed the Examples of the Booke of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which containes a ſhort and briefe ſtory of the things done from the beginning of the world to the death of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> for the ſpace as it is thought by ſome, of 2309 years or therabouts, and of ſome, of 60 more, becauſe they doe differ in judgement, ſo much about the age of <hi>Terah,</hi> when he begat <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The maine thing in the whole ſtory to be obſerved is, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully the providence of God, wrought by degrees, to bring his Church from out of the loynes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to make it a great and mighty Nation, which was but a little family, preſerving truth, and Religion, in that houſehold and lineage, when hee ſuffered all other Nations by little and little to follow their owne way and runne into Idolatry and abominations.</p>
