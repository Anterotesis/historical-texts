            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And vpon this answere, <hi>Alimodes</hi> commaunded the Cannon to be planted against the walles, and the soldiers to giue their assault: There might you heare the Cannos roaring, the Barbed horses neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the glistering armor shining, the drummes striking vp, the Trumpets and clarions sounding the dismall and cruell March of the Pagans: he caused his chiefe standerd, to be erected in the midst of his host, against which the ordinaunce of the Citty play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such musike, that many of the Turkes were sent to hell, to do homage to their God <hi>Mahomet:</hi> the rest did so closely (by their continual industry) intrench themselues, that the Cannon could haue no power ouer them:</p>
               <p>But the Citizens omitting no time that might serue for their purpose, made a secret issue out of the Towne, and so on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain set vpon them, that at the least two thowsand of them were slaine without any hurt to the townsemen (almost at all.)</p>
               <p>The Captaine and the Prouost being expert warriours, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great discomfiture of their enemies, sent presently newe

supply out of the towne and so pursued the enemie, that at the least they slew fourteen hundred more, at which sodaine alarme, the King himselfe (not hearing before of the slaughter of his men) gaue a fresh charge vpon the Cittizens, so as they were (by reason of the multitude of their aduersaries) compelled to recoile backe, and entered the towne at a posterne gate, which they had giuen most especiall charge to the Cittizens, to be kept for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Alimodes</hi> hearing the retreat of his enemies sounded, he retired him self againe into his pauillion, greatly displeased for this his extreame losse &amp; slaughter of his soldiers at the begining of his seidge: but <hi>Blanchardine</hi> all this while standing vpon the walles, and séeing the valure of the Cittizens, and the disconfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the infidells, mourned to him self: whome when the Prouost being returned had saluted, enquiring the cause of his heauines: (Ah sir quoth he) I haue forsaken father, and mother, country and fréends to séeke aduentures in strange landes, and wishing all happines to the most redoubted Empresse of <hi>Torma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:</hi> yet finding my selfe altogether vnarmed, and vnfit to enter the sight vnfurnished, makes me to haue this dolance and griefe.

               <p>One of the daughters of the Prouost, perceiuing <hi>Blanchardine</hi> to be armed, ready to be gone with her father, brought him a white damask caparizon for his horse. And withall a black scarfe for himselfe to weare, which shée requested him to carry in his helmet for her sake: <hi>Blanchardine</hi> most thankfully receiued these fréendly presents, and imployed them as you haue heard. So the damosell recommending them both to the protection of God, humbly tooke her leaue.</p>

And not slack to augment the praises of his fréend, (and one whom duety had tyed him vnto) pursued his commendation in this sort.</p>

               <p>Madam answered the Prouost, this thing is most strange vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, for neuer (as yet) could I so much as imagine any such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, neither hath any report bruted it in my eares: But yf my daughter should happen on such a knight as is <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> she might boldly vaunt, that no Lady in the world could wish a more happy content.

<pb facs="tcp:4844:16"/>
these aduentures: therefore it were a monstrous folly and deepe absurdity in your daughter, to carry such an ouerwée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of her selfe, as to imagine that she were a match worthye of such a paramour: therefore (as you regarde my displeasure) haue secret, yet speciall care, of the wanton glaunces and familiar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements of your daughter with that yong knight: and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you shall not thinke that I compact this, to preiudice or hinder the preferments of your daughters, send them spéedily to my Court, to attend on my person, where for your seruice, and their owne sakes, I will prouide them husbands, to your &amp; their contents, neither shall they néede any cost or dowry from you.</p>
               <p>The prouost most humbly thanking her Maiestie for this her princely offer, for the preferment of his daughters, promised for euer all obseruance and duety to her highnes: but when he was ready to departe, the Quéene commaunded him that hee should bring the said Knight the next morning to her presence, where she might first by her speech and countenance, and after by libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rewardes, requite the honourable attempts he had vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in her quarrell, because (quoth she) by his onely ayde and valour, our warres doe sorte to happie end.

<pb facs="tcp:4844:17"/>
take not in ill part what I haue saide, for vpon the faith I doe owe to your selfe, it is most true: therefore let vs in the morning goe to the Court, that her maiestye may perceiue that I haue done her commaund, which if you finde contrary, neuer haue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance nor truth in me againe.</p>
               <p>With these and such like speech, <hi>Blanchardine</hi> and the Prouost went to the Court, where the Quéene (then in counsell with her Lords about the warres) séeing <hi>Rlanchardine</hi> and the Prouost enter the presence, arofe to welcome them: and with attention casting her eyes on <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> commended within her selfe, the rare perfection both of beauty and courage she perceiued in him, yet loth to make manifest what she intended to keep most secret, did bridle affection for the time.</p>
               <p>The Ladies and Gentlewomen there present, wondered at the admirable proportion of his body, &amp; singularity of his beauty, hauing heard of the dexteritie of armes, which he manfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed in the warres before the Cittie of <hi>Tormaday.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>But at length the Quéene breaking silence, tooke <hi>Blanchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> by the hand, requesting him to sit down by her, which he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for manners (then vnwillingnes) refused, till at the last by meere constraint, after most humble reuerence he obeyed.</p>
               <p>Then the Quéene after long deliberation, said vnto him: Sir Knight, your comming into this Cittie, hath béene much to our comfort and aduauncement, for which we humblye thanke the Gods: but for the most valiant prowes you haue shewed, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding our aduersaries, we gratifie you with all kindenes, and will rewarde you most honourably.</p>

               <p>Herewith the Queene marking the debonaire countenance of <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> shee was so rauished in contemplation of his beauty, that almost distraught of her sences, he might well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that loue had made her his votary.</p>

               <p>Then answered the Quéene, she of whome I made mencion to your Host, is neerely allied vnto my selfe, whose welfare I tender as my owne.</p>

               <p>Then replyed the Queene, wel gentle knight, because I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not longer conceale affection, and that I féele my hart so espri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with this swéete conference which now I haue with you (al circumstance laid aparte) I am constrained to manifest my loue: Know therfore, that whatsoeuer I spake vnto the Prouost concerning any Lady, my selfe am the same, whom neither time nor age can make to forget your noble and curteous demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the Ladyes, Lords, and Cittizens wondered at the haughty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> much commending his generosity &amp; braue carriage on horsebacke: And all praiers were made, for his safe returne.</p>
               <p>Thus marched he out of the gates, and came to the place where the Giant stayed his comming: whome when the Giant beheld, he sternly demaunded of whence he was, and what vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduised chaunce had brought him thither? <hi>Blanchardine</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I will not for any dread of thée (accursed miscriant) conceile my name nor parentage: know, I am sonne to the King of <hi>Frize</hi> my name is <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> sent to combate with thée, by my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and most faire Princesse <hi>Eglantine,</hi> Quéene of <hi>Tormaday</hi> surnamed the proude Lady in loue.</p>

               <p>So fetching their carreirs, they encountered the one the other with such haughtie courage, that both their launces shiuered to their handes: Then betaking themselues to their swordes, their strokes were so terrible, that the fire flue out of their helmets, and for a while the fierce fight remained doubtfull.</p>
               <p>Nowe was the Quéene of <hi>Tormayday</hi> ascended her gallery window whence the might behold the combatants, and fearing much (by reason of the hugenes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Giant) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>But this doubtfull fight was at length finished by <hi>Blanchadine,</hi> who casting his eyes to the window where his louely Quéene lay, his courage augmenting by the vertue he drew from her: vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the sudden, hee lent the Giant such a cuff, that hee tumbled

               <p>The King beholding the pittifull demaund of his daughter, whome aboue all creatures in the world he loued, answered her in this wise.</p>

               <p>When the King had giuen attention to this tale of his sonne <hi>Sadony,</hi> considering the great bands wherein he thought himself bound to <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> and also loth to incurre the ignominious slander of his home born subiects in denying this petition, which tended for the good of <hi>Blanchardine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> hee presently not onely gaue command that men should be leuied, money in readines, &amp; ships prepared for them: but also séemed more desirous than they, for the spéedie dispatch in those affaires. And on the third day after, fourtéene thousand men were in readines, for to be shipt awaye vnder the conduct of <hi>Blanchardine</hi> and <hi>Sadony,</hi> with al things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to such an hoast.</p>
               <p>When men and victualls were aboord, the King in person ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied <hi>Blanchardine</hi> and his sonne to the sea side, and withall brought foure of his idolatrous golden gods, gorgeously adorned with pearle and precious stones, commending their safetie to them in their iourney.</p>
               <p>After the departure of the King to his Court, they weighed anchor, and hoyst vp their sayles, and by the industrie of skifull Pilots, in short time came within two dayes sayle of the Citie of <hi>Tormaday.</hi> But houering a little on the seas to escrie land, they espied a ship a kenning off, which séemed to bende her course to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Tormaday,</hi> whom anone they hayled: and comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord, they found within the vessel the good Prouost of <hi>Tormaday,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4844:29"/>
who was returned from the kingdome of <hi>Norway,</hi> whether hée was sent from the Quéene of <hi>Tormaday,</hi> for supply of souldiers to raise the siege of <hi>Alimodes:</hi> whom when <hi>Blanchardine</hi> espied, glad beyond measure of such happie méeting, made him almost forget that euer he had sorrowed before. And demaunding of the Prouost first of his Countrey, secondly of the gouernment, and thirdly the cause of his voyage? He answered, that being sent by the Quéene of <hi>Tormaday<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to procure aide from the King of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> to repulse <hi>Alimodes</hi> &amp; his host, and that before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thether, the King was dead, so that her comfort there was vtterly quailed. Now <hi>Blanchardine</hi> perceiuing that the Prouost knew him not by reason of the colour he had depainted himselfe withall, to resemble the Countrey men of <hi>Spruce,</hi> questioned farther with the Prouost, of the Quéen and her Dominions? vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the Prouost replyed. The Realme is called <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and <hi>Tormaday</hi> is the principall place and Citie within the Realme, both for concourse of people, strength and traffique. Our Quéene is named <hi>Eglantine</hi> the faire, and by reason of her chastitie, she is surnamed, the proud Ladie in loue. And know good sir, that manie and sundrie Princes, Kings and Emperors haue continually sollicited our Quéene in marriage: but she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer regarded their requests, by reason of a yong Knight, whom aboue all the world she loueth so tenderly, as I thinke vnles she he are some speedie newes of him, being lately taken prisoner by the King <hi>Alimodes,</hi> and sent to <hi>Cassidony</hi> from thence, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed to <hi>Salmandry</hi> to the King there: whose brother <hi>Rubion</hi> hee slew before <hi>Tormaday,</hi> shee (I saye) will neuer enioye anie felicitie or happines. Why quoth <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> thinke you not that since that yong Knight is gone, and that no tidings can bee brought to her of him, that she will accept one of vs for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, vpon condition we deliuer her, from the hands of king <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limodes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah good sir, (quoth the Prouost) I am so assured of her constancie, and inuiolable oath, which she hath plighted to that Knight, that she will neuer yeeld to any other though she should presently suffer death, and that her crowne, kingdome and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, should be for euer captiuated and ouerthrowne.</p>

                  <hi>Blanchardine</hi> tickled with this sugred discourse of the Prouost, finding by his tale, that none but himselfe had wonne the fort of her fancie, rounded <hi>Sadony</hi> in the eare: and tolde him that this was the Ladie, whose seruice he was bound to prosecute.</p>
               <p>The Prouost séeing by <hi>Blanchardines</hi> courteous salutations, that he had no need to doubt of anie villanie, demaunded secretly if these were or would conioin to the rescue of his Ladie and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, the proud Ladie in loue, against her soe and cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie King <hi>Alimodes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What (quoth <hi>Blanchardine</hi>) thinke you vs so foolish, as for to venture our bodies, liues and goods, to succor her, who is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted to one, whom she is vncertaine euer to see againe? Yet this I know, that womens fancies alter with euery winde, their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is onely mutabilitie, and full of inconstancie: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I maruell how you dare vndertake, that shee beeing a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, will remaine constant to one that is either dead, or neuer like to returne to her againe aliue.</p>
               <p>Ha ha sir said the Prouost, if you were as priuie to her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in her loue to hir deuoted frend as I am, you would vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemne in your selfe, this vaine iucredulitie which now you seeme to hold, and imagine in womens loues.</p>
               <p>I pray thee (quoth <hi>blanchardine</hi>) what is the name of that yong Knight, which she doth dote vpon so much?</p>
               <p>His name (quoth the Prouost) is <hi>Blanchardine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> sonne to the King of <hi>Frizeland,</hi> a man of such generositie and valour, that through the world I think he hath no compeere: and my Ladies thoughts doo so wander vpon his perfections, that in the day, shee remembreth nothing so much as him, and in the night scant drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth on anie thing but him, imagining still to see him return to her rescue: so that in my opinion, it were better to performe all the labours of <hi>Hercules</hi> againe, than to vndertake the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her loue, which is so strongly and surely grounded vppon the rocke of his affection, that no winde which anie mouth can blow, will make her once to stagger, in her determinations, and on my life what I haue said is true.</p>

After which, he calling the Prouost aside, tolde him that all those ships were fraught with Panims and Saracens, and that he himselfe was a Saracen: but (quoth hee) I knowe the man that you name, <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> who at this hower lieth imprisoned among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims in a most obscure dungeon: and the greatest comfort hee hath, is, that your Ladie and Quéene yet liueth, whom hee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth one day to visite againe, because he imagineth, that his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is her onely discontentment.</p>
               <p>Ah verie God quoth the Prouost, that his returne might bee speedely, for in this time of his absence, no comfort can once make seazure on her hart, so that she being disquieted, al the Court and Citie lamenteth.</p>
               <p>After the Prouost had receiued the letter, and in humble wise taken leaue of <hi>blanchardine,</hi> he hoysed vp his sayles and poasted towards <hi>Tormaday,</hi> with such celeritie, that within two dayes he safely arriued there. Then he entring the Citie by a little po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne, repaired to the Church of our Ladie, where most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he thanked God for his prosperous returne: which being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, hee presently went to the Court, where being entred the Presence, hee found the Quéene sitting verie melancholy: but making his dutifull obeysance to her Maiestie, he recounted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

her these newes, That at his arriuall at <hi>Norway</hi> hee found the King her vnckle dead two dayes before, and all the Lordes most pensiue and sorrowfull for his losse: but deliuering his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage to the Peeres, they made this reply, that so soone as the obsequies and funeralls of the King were performed, they would (according to their duties) make preparation for her seruice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by discent their naturall Quéen and Princesse, whom aboue all other they were bounden to obay. When the Queene heard of her vnckles death, she grew most sorrowfull: but the Prouost desirous to put her out of such dumpes, certefied her of the huge Fleete of Panims that he met vppon the seas, and that a great Commaunder of the rest, requested him to deliuer this letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Maiesties own hands, which he promised faithfully to do, considering my duetie to your Maiestie, and the gentle vsage of the Panims towards me, at that time when I expected nothing but death. The Ladie receiuing the letter, so soone as she had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened it, found the contents to this effect.</p>
               <p>Most magnificent Princesse, the thred of my wearied life hath euer been lengthened, by the hope I haue had to succor your distresses, whom aboue all the world I honor and esteeme: and after my manifold and hard aduentures, beeing captiuated and made prisoner to king <hi>Alimodes,</hi> by the heauenly prouidence of God, I am deliuered and set frée. For beeing sent from you by the said king, vnder the safekeeping of his sonne <hi>Darius</hi> and three score soldiers, to bee presented to the king of <hi>Salmandry,</hi> whose brother <hi>Rubion</hi> I slew before the walls of <hi>Tormaday:</hi> being on the sea, the ship wherein I was (caried by rage of tempest) split vpon a huge rock so that of the three score men that were in her, none escaped but my selfe, who (by the great prouidence of God) bestrid a peece of the maine mast, and in little tune was carried a shore in the land of <hi>Spruce,</hi> not farre from the citie of <hi>Marien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh,</hi> where by reason of warre I haue beene constrained to serue in the warres of a Saracen King, with whom for my good deserts I haue obtained high rewards And vppon my humble petition to his Maiestie, he hath deliuered me fourteen thousand fighting men, with sufficient money, iewells and prouision, and withall hath sent his onely sonne <hi>Sadony</hi> in my companie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue

And thus in all humilitie, recommending my selfe and my true affection to your sacred person, the onely organ of my blisse and welfare, I take my leaue, praying God, to grant you accomplishment of all your happie desires.

héere he writeth, that hauing obtained the Princely fauor of the King of <hi>Spruse,</hi> whose enemy being the king of <hi>Polond:</hi> he van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, and deliuered prisoner into his hands, for whose trusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and in requitall of whose valor, he hath deliuered vnto him those shippes well furnished, with men, munition and victuall, and withall sent his Sonne and Heire apparant to the Crowne of <hi>Spruse</hi> in his assotiation and companye, for our deliuery and rescue, from the tyrany of this Pagan King <hi>Alimodes.</hi> And that within these two daies he will not fayle to come a land at <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maday,</hi> with all his garrisons and companies.</p>
               <p>When the Prouost had diligently attended this pleasant discourse of the Quéene, in deliuering the swéet contentes of the letter of <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> being greatly astonisht at this suddaine accident, calling to his remembrance the comely proportion of him that deliuered the letter, and comparing it with <hi>Blanchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine:</hi> made her this answere.</p>
               <p>Truely Madam, well might he séem to carry the proportion of <hi>Blanchardine</hi> in body, but his countenance and visage, séemed more like a Tawny Moore then his sweet semblance: and ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could I imagine by hys behauiour, neyther gather by hys wordes, any notice of <hi>Blanchardins</hi> person, sauing only that hee told mee he knew the man, and that his imprisonment was such and so straight among the infidels, that his returne was neuer to be expected. And this is all (may it please your Maiestie) that I could eyther imagine or coniecture of him.</p>
               <p>After these speaches ended betwéene the Quéen and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uost, she sent for her nurse, who assending vp into a gallerie, from whence she might decerne the sea, and sayles afarre off, she began to enter parley with her in this manner.</p>
               <p>Thou art altogether vnacquainted, (swéet Nurse) both of the cause of my hastie sending for thée, &amp; of the pleasant newes, which the Prouost hath brought me, yet because thy fidelitie hath euer bene a consolation to my sorowes, I will acquaint thee therewith.</p>

               <p>Prouision was forthwith with all posible speede made.

               <p>Then taking the Lady by the hand, he presented her to <hi>Sado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> in this sort.

them presently, to be conueighed to this Citty, there to remaine during their liues, captiues. And these (most mighty Princes) are the prisoners, whose lamentation, you heare.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Blanchardine</hi> heard him speake of <hi>Frize,</hi> ablushing red beautifying his chéekes, he began straight to coniecture, that out of all doubt this Lord was desended of his linage and house, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding presently to fetch them before him &amp; the other princes, which the posting messenger, spéedily performed: and hauing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented them to the three Princes, <hi>Blanchardine</hi> fixing a stéedfast view vpon them, knew his father, (although the hard imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and hungry diet, had masserated and made him leaner then he was wont to be) whereat <hi>Blanchardine</hi> began secretly to lament the hard distresse of his aged Sire. But incurraging himselfe to speake, he demaunded of him, what country man he was, and the chaunce that brought him into these calamities? The aged king, faint by reason of famine: and feble by his age, after a little pause made this reply.</p>
               <p>Know sir, that I am a most distressed and captiue King, my Country (which of long time I gouerned, with happines and quiet) is called <hi>Frize,</hi> scituated néere the sea, but through the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie and chaunce of fortune my land hath béene depopulated and layde waste, my subiectes slaine, and my selfe with diuers of my nobles taken prisoners, by <hi>Darius</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Alimodes,</hi> who not pittying my age and gray haires, hath too too long inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vs, within a most obscure and darke prison, full of venim and fylth: in which I and my poore company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are ready to famish, for want of sustenance, against the law of God, manand nature: vtterly refusing all ransomes, that haue béene proffered for our deliueries.</p>
               <p>But a Sonne I had [whose yeares and countenance presa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging valure] made both my selfe and his mother, to haue too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a care ouer him, fearing some worse euent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee had cause to dread: and for this onely cause we rather tooke care, to instruct him in learned sciences, then to pricke him forward to beare armes, who like a Lion vnwilling to bee tamed, and spend his yeares in subiection and home bred toyes, because I refused to
<pb facs="tcp:4844:43"/>
inuest him with the order of knighthood, one day very secretly, (without all our priuities) went away: and since his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wee haue not so much as receiued any newes or tidinges of him, which hath bred in me such sorrow &amp; griefe, that I wish rather a thousand times to die then thus to liue depriued, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of my liberty and kingdome, but of my Sonne, whose toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines (being a child) was of all admired, and whose losse (through my fault) of all pittied. Therefore my humble petition is (if it rest in your powers), to rid me by some kind of death, out of this lothsome and gréeuous thraldoms, wherein I now liue, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account it a happines to dye, than thus distressed with mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to liue. After which his pittyfull complaint, the teares dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled doune his waterie eyes, vppon his aged face so thick, that made all the company to be waile his hard aduenture &amp; mishap, but especially <hi>Blanchardine</hi> his sonne, within whome loue and pitty made their combat.</p>
               <p>Sir quoth <hi>Blanchardine</hi>) may it be, that if your son were héere at this time, considering his long departure from you, doe you imagine that you shoulde knowe him, by his fauour and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?</p>
               <p>Ah (answered the king to well I knowe, that these my droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping eyes, which pore still vppon my graue, shall neuer receiue such content, as once to infix them selues on his amyable face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blanchardine</hi> not able any longer to conceale himselfe from his aged father, sayd vnto him, know noble King, that not long since, this noble Gentleman <hi>Sadony</hi> and my selfe, not only sawe your Son, but accompanied him long time. And betwéene vs, were all things common, so that the mutuall kindnes and loue, which we conceiued of echother, was by no meane to bee disioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and we accounted of one an other, as of our selues: in so much, that at his departure from our company, he gaue me this ring of gold, which héere I weare, and for his sake, will reserue during my life.</p>
               <p>The good old King, remembring the perfect forme of the ring, which his sonne <hi>Blanchardine</hi> had shewen him, knew presently that it was the ring, which his granfather vsed to weare, and at
<pb facs="tcp:4844:44"/>
his death vequethed the same to <hi>Blanchardine.</hi> And being by this sight the more encoraged, he in most humble maner requested to vnderstand the cause of his sonnes departure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their honorable companies, and the place, whether they did imagine he had bent his course, hoping at length (if euer he obtained fréedome) to visit his sonne <hi>Blanchardine.</hi> But when he heard him not reply to his humble demannd, the olde King suspecting, that his departure, was rather a seperation by death then a voluntary absence from their society, after sundry and gréeuous sighes, was ready to sound. But <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> who now perceiued by his pittiful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, that vnles he should make himselfe knowne, it myght he greatly preiudiciall to his health, and that delay in such a case, bred great danger: he reuoking his former obstinacy, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himselfe, began to make himselfe knowne to the old man in this sort.</p>
               <p>Most redoubted Lord and déere father, beholde <hi>Blanchardine</hi> your sonne, whose offence to your maiestie deserueth no fauour, in that his departure from your Court was most secretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from all (but especially from your selfe) humbly submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himselfe, to your doome, craueth your honourable pardon, both for his fault in departing, and also for the gallant courser, and sword which hee priuily conuayed away with him with the which among many other, he hath reuenged your wrongs vpon your enemy <hi>Darius,</hi> and his accursed company of miscreants.</p>
               <p>When his aged father the King of <hi>Frize,</hi> heard the dutyfull and debonaire submission of his sonne (whome till that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant he knew not) by reason of the obscuritie, and darkenes of his prison, &amp; also his declining age: neither can my pen recount nor my tong relate, the happie content he receiued, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall applause to all (But especially to <hi>Sadony,</hi> and the faire <hi>Beautrix,</hi> who all this while, were attentiue beholders of this rare accident, and when they perceiued the ful issue of all which had happened betwéene them, they congratulated this happy chance with <hi>Blanchardine</hi> and his father.

<pb facs="tcp:4844:47"/>
The Quéene leading him into the toppe of her Turret, shewed him this huge Nauy, demaunding who they might be? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uost béeing ingenious, and full of corrage, answered, that they were (as he thought) Christians, both by the shew of their flags, streamers and appendants: ah God graunt (quoth the Quéene) they be. The Prouost replying, requested her maiestie to send him, not only to make inquirie what they were, but also to wage them, if he could, to fight vnder her maiesties standerds, against <hi>Alimodes</hi> and his forces.</p>
               <p>The Quéene desirous of succour, condecended, and presently dispatched the Prouost accordingly, who without delay tooke a ship boat, rowed with eight tall fellowes, and by their diligence and paine; he came aboord the ship where <hi>Blanchardine</hi> was, who desirous to vnderstand what they might be, that posted so fast to come aboord him, walked vp and doune vpon the hatches vntill they were assended. Then the Prouost began with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datious corrage, to deliuer the Embassage of his Quéene and Mistres, in as ample manner as shee had giuen him in charge: <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> whose affection to the Prouost was not forgotten well perceiuing the cause of his speach, to tend to the succour of his Princesse and country, enquired of him: If occasion were that no ayd should come, how long he thought the towne was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble todefend it selfe, against the force of <hi>Alimodes,</hi> both with men, munition and necessarie prouision of victuall. Sir answered the Prouost, our city is wel fortefied, for many moneths, as yet, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we doubt of <hi>Alimodes</hi> forces, which are not able to hurt vs: but one thing séemeth most displeasant vnto all her subiectes, that neyther night nor day, her maiestie enioyeth any content, tormenting her selfe with sighes and passions, which we all dout will sort to some hard euent, vnlesse a spéedy remedy be found for her recomforture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blanchardine</hi> very desirous to vnderstand, what disaster y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might be, which so vnkindly, bred such discontentment to the Quéene, earuestly solicited the Prouost, to relate the cause at large.</p>
               <p>The Prouost most willingly obeying the princely commaund and gentle intreaty of <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> answered in this sort</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4844:47"/>Know sir, that the extreamity of griefe, that our Quéene hath inwardly conceiued for the losse of the most braue accomplisht man of the worlde, who in her defence, behaued himselfe with such vallor against her foes, that in hers, and all our iudgements and opinions, hee through the world may not bee equalized for magnanimitie. And not long since hauing by the mighty proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, escaped many &amp; imminent daungers, sayling he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a mighty army of braue soldiers, for our rescue, a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine tempest arising at sea, he with his warlike company, were enforced to commit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to the mercy of the waues, which at that instant, threatened naught but death, and destruction to them all. But thankes be to the highest heauens, not long since a pilgrime passenger, dryue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> byte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pest vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this our coast, brought vs the most happiest tidings, that we could desire, &amp; which bred more content to our Quéene, then all the worlde could afforde, (which was) that at his departure from the City of <hi>Cassidony,</hi> the chiefe Citie of our aduersarie <hi>Alimodes,</hi> this braue man at armes, named <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> &amp; the mightie Prince <hi>Sadony</hi> sonne to the King of <hi>Spruse,</hi> were not only landed there with a most puisaunt army of resolute knights, Gentlemen and soldiers, but had vanquished and slaine, our mortall enemy <hi>Darius,</hi> sacked his City and people, and that by the procurement of <hi>Blanchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> the Prince <hi>Sadony</hi> had wedded the beautifull Lady <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> (<hi>Alimodes</hi> daughter) by whose right heis now fully possessed with the signiory and kingdome of <hi>Cassidony,</hi> the which he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth with all tranquility, peace and happines, being (not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly himselfe, by the honorable perswasion of <hi>Blanchardine</hi> become christned) but also hath established the true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through the whole Country, to the honor of God, and the great commendation of him, and all his adherents.</p>
               <p>When the Prouost had thus discoursed at large to <hi>Blanchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> the message and report of the pilgrime, <hi>Blanchardine</hi> made this reply, that what the pilgrim had said, was most true, sauing in one thing, that whereas the pilgrim informed, that <hi>Sadony</hi> is or shall be married, to the faire <hi>Beautrix Alimodes</hi> daughter, that (quoth he) is vtterly false, in mistaking the man, for it is <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardine</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4844:48"/>
that shall espouse her, and he it is that hath sent me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, in succour and ayde to your Queene of <hi>Tormaday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah very God (quoth the Prouost) and can it be, that so Noble a Gentleman as <hi>Blanchardine</hi> is, shoulde so much dishonor and forget himselfe, to be affianced to any but our Queene, whose loyall loue, hath neuer receiued with any (but him) neither spot or fellowship, and who for his sake, hath vtterly refused and set at naught the royall proffers of many and mighty Kings? No, no sir, neither can I be brought to beleiue that any such thought can harbour in the head of that heroyike knight, neither woulde I for milions of gold, be the reporter of this vnhappy newes to hermaiestie, being well assured, that vpon the relation, naught but death could end her calamities.</p>
               <p>Therefore noble Gentleman, either dispatch me hence, with more happy newes, or neuer suffer me to returne, with such hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy tydings. Yet since it hath pleased you to relate vnto me, that your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming hither (in the behalfe of our Queene) is by the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall procurement and sending of <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> let me intreate you to know, whether hee haue recommended himselfe to my Lady by letter or no, that therein she may perceiue the full of his determination.</p>

               <p>Alas quoth the Prouost may it so bee that hee can forget the Princely loue and beauty of our Queene, who esteeming him far aboue al kings, sent him her good Courfer, &amp; one of her sleeues at his encounter with his foes (The rather by that meanes) to manifest the integrity of her true affection to him, whose only grace, hath battered the bulwarke of her Addamanted brest: and whose loue shall neuer dissolue except death finish it?</p>

               <p>After this she gaue in charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the streetes should be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with costly clothes, and that the swéetest musicke shoulde continually play, to welcome her loue <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> which was presently effected, so that the City séemed rather an earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, then a garison towne of soldiers, by reason of the melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous soundes of all sortes of instruments, the sweet voices of men and women, the musicall hermonies of Clarions, Simballs, Lutes, Hoboyes, Cornets and trumpets that then were heard.</p>
               <p>The Bels began to ring throughout the Citie, the Preistes to sing procession, the boyes to make bonefires, and the maides to chaunt their Roundelayes, that al mourning laid aside, there was no cause of discomsiture to be seene.</p>
               <p>Now the King <hi>Alimodes</hi> being at supper within his Pauili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:4844:50"/>
as though the foure Elements had encountred together. The dust began to rise so thicke that it almost dimd the brightnes of the Sunne, by reason whereof, they within the City perceiued not their freindes from their enemies. Then went the Noble Quéene and all the matrons of <hi>Tormaday,</hi> barefooted, to the Churches from one to an other, exorating the powers of heauen to strengthen the paizaunce of <hi>Blanchadine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and all his associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, and to confound the misbeléeuing infidels, <hi>Almodes</hi> and his companies.</p>
               <p>After these orizons finished, the Quéene calling her nurse, mounted vp into her gallerie, from whence she might well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the assaults on both sides, where shee long beheld diuers Knights and soldiers flaine, others dismounted from their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, sore mangled and wounded, wallowing in their owne gore, their horses running vp and downe, without their guides and riders. But in this hotte skirmish, <hi>Blanchardine</hi> singled foorth a Duke, a man of great account and prowes, whome at the first méeting with his Launce, he sent dead to the ground. And before his Launce brake, he confounded fiue or six. And folowing his happie entrance, he so behaued himselfe, that his sword was too well knowne among the Pagans, for he had altered the Azure cullor thereof, into a crimson red, with the blood of the foe, so that happie was he that might rid himselfe from <hi>Blanchardine:</hi> sury. And if <hi>Alimodes</hi> had not supplied the defectiue troopes of his slaughtered soldiers, with a band often thousand fresh, the day had on his side bene turnd to night, vpon which began the clamor oft he soldiers to eccoe in the sky, when giuing each other the fresh onset, the battell seemed more feirce then at the first. But <hi>Blanchardine</hi> (instigated with honor and loue) still hazarded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe among the thickest of his enimies, whome they knew too well for their profits. And being enclosed within a ring of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, they freshly assayled him on euery side, eyther to slay him or make him their captiue, which cruelties, he (hauing before too well experimented) rather determined to die, then to bee taken prisoner. And in this resolution, hee so coragiously behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that none durst enter within the reach of his weapon. And
<pb facs="tcp:4844:50"/>
although his horse was sore wounded, and him selfe most daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously hurt in many places, not séeing any way to encounter such a multitude without great danger, yet with maine force he retired himselfe back among his companie.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Sadony</hi> who all this while stood not idle, singled out a mightie Giaunt named <hi>Corhorant,</hi> second brother to the King <hi>Alimodes,</hi> whome vpon the shock, at their encounter, hee sent both horse and man to the ground, and accepting the benefit of fortune and time, alighted from his horse and disseuered hys head from his body. The good king of <hi>Frize</hi> whose corage was strong (although by reason of age) his body was weake, what by his encoragement of the soldiers, and great experience in feates ofarmes, did great damage to <hi>Alimodes</hi> and his soldiers: In the meane the valiant <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> féeling his horse (by reason of his woundes to faint vnder him) alighted and betooke himselfe to his sword, with the which he so manfully behaued himselfe as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did any knight, till at the last the enemy perceiuing him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, pressed so fast by heapes vpon him that they tooke him prisoner. At which suddaine applause, the whole troope of miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants gaue a mightie shoote, but <hi>Sadony</hi> perceiuing the distressed case of his trusty friend <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> hasted so fall vppon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimy with his company, that heaset at libertie him, that before they thought to be most sure prisoner. When <hi>Blanchardine</hi> saw himselfe free, he presently mounted a fresh horse, &amp; tooke a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Launce. And perceiuing <hi>Alimodes</hi> somewhat distant from his companie, gaue the spurres to his horse, and by his agillitie and mightie prowes bare him out of his saddell to the earth And at that instant had seuered his head from his body, had not spéedy succour come. This foile bred such a desire of reuenge in <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modes,</hi> that so soone as he was mounted againe, he wasted <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardine</hi> to the second encounter, which he most willingly conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vnto, in regard of the honor he should atchiue by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. And as before, so he serued him the second time for had not <hi>Alimodes</hi> béene rescued againe, he had se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his soule to <hi>Carons</hi> ferry bote, to passe him ouer <hi>Phlegiton,</hi> to craue his wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring pasport of <hi>Eacus, Minos</hi> and <hi>Radamant,</hi> to the infernall bloody marshal

fieldes.</p>
               <p>Now the Quéene of <hi>Tormaday</hi> (who as I said before) stoode with her nurse in the gallery window, perceiuing plainely this braue combat, betweene <hi>Blanchardine</hi> and the King <hi>Alimodes</hi> which bred her most sweet content: She foorthwith called vnto her a young Knight, whome she commaunded presently to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a white dammask sleeue (which she pulled from her gowne) with her kindest commendations to <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> requesting him for her sake, not ouly to weare the same, but also to alter the cullor, with the blood of her enemie <hi>Alimodes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The young knight hauing receiued this ambassage from the Quéene, spéedily posted to deliuer it to <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> vnto whom being aproched, he presented both the Quéenes commendations and the sleeue.</p>
               <p>This vnexpected present, was more welcome to <hi>Blanchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> then a million of gold, who receiuing it with all humilitie and kindnes, promised the performance of her maiesties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, so far foorth as both his life and currage shoulde permit, not forgetting most humbly to commend him to the good grace of the Quéene: with which fréendly answer the messenger after his bountifull reward from <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> returned.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Blanchardine</hi> (whome this princely fauour made most forward) with eger desire of victory, entred presently the thickest of his enemies, where he so brauely behaued himselfe, that few or none durst approch his presence for feare of death, which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dony</hi> and the residue of his company perceiuing, pressed the more forward for his ayd. And not long after, through the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious capasitie and magnonimious courrage of <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> and the noble <hi>Sadony, Alimodes</hi> and his miscreant troope being discomforted, began to betake themselues to flight, hauing in that battell lost the greater part of his soldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sadony</hi> the young Prince perceiuing <hi>Alimodes</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies to be discomforted and to fly, pursued them so fast in their flight, that on the suddaine he ouertooke a mightie man named <hi>Gallizeus,</hi> third brother to <hi>Alimodes,</hi> whome he so saluted with his sword, that he fell dead from his horse. But when <hi>Alimodes</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4844:51"/>
perceiued his brother slaine, &amp; by the prowes of one only Knight, with extreame anger hee commaunded all his vassailes at once to set vpon him, who long time most ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fully defended himselfe: but finding his horse to faint vnder him, by reason of his many woundes, was constrained to alight, and not able long to endure the force of so many enemies, was enforced to yeild, and had at that instant béene slaine had not <hi>Alimodes</hi> charged vpon paine of death, that hee should be taken aliue, to cause him to endure a more miserable end.</p>
               <p>Now the clamor of the Pagans began excéedingly at the taking of the Prince <hi>Sadony,</hi> so that the noyses rung in the eares of <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> and when the company had certified him thereof, he stayed not, but with all celeritie posted towards the enemie to recouer him, but <hi>Alimodes</hi> and his folke perceiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at hand, got them aboord their ships with all possible speed they might, but a number of them were cut off before they might reach the Sea, and cruelly murdered. But when they perceiued that <hi>Alimodes</hi> was already ascended his ships, and had <hi>Sadony</hi> aboord him, hee galloping on the strond with a lofty voice, called to <hi>Alimodes,</hi> to raunsome his friend <hi>Sadony,</hi> with a hundreth thousand crownes and six thousand of his Pagan pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, but <hi>Alimodes</hi> replyed that hee should not returne, except the faire Quéene <hi>Eglantine</hi> might be his raunsome, where vnto <hi>Blanchardine</hi> replyed that he would vpon condition that <hi>Sadony,</hi> might come ashore. But the false Panim <hi>Alimodes,</hi> fearing the losse of his prisoner, commaunded his sayles to be presently hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the ships to Launce, and bend their course to <hi>Cassidony,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a little gale ready to carry them away.</p>

               <p>Nowe was the beautifull <hi>Eglantine</hi> Quéene of <hi>Tormaday,</hi> come before <hi>Banchardine</hi> to yéeld him humble thankes for his excéeding paines, and true valor shewed in her seruice, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of all sinister accidents touching the captiuitie of <hi>Sadony:</hi> at whose approch, the virmillion red did so bepaint his manlike face, that euery one might well perceiue the integritie of his affection by his countenance: on the other side the Quéene taken (as it were with an Apoplexie) was for the time like one in a trance, not able through excéeding loue to vtter a woord, till <hi>Blanchardine</hi> taking her betwéene his armes, seizing vpon her rosial lips with a swéete kisse, had a little reuiued her, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to her selfe, shee woulde faine haue spoken, but yet was tung-tide, onely suffering her eyes to bée the true messengers of her thought. But <hi>Blanchardine</hi> breaking silence began in this manner.</p>
               <p>Most bewtifull Quéene and my redoubted loue and mistres, as health doth bring most sollace to the sicke, libertie to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and foode to the hungry, so doth your Angelicall presence reuiue mée, who (euen now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the extremitie of sorrow had almost confounded. The Sunshine of my blisse, was turned to a cloudie fogge, my mirth to mone, my sollace to sadnes, and my day to night, in loosing the man whome heauen adores, whome earth admires, and men doe reuerence. O that the dismall day had bin obscured, when first this hellish Tirant <hi>Alimodes,</hi> bent his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy forces against this royall Towne, wherein although he hath
<pb facs="tcp:4844:53"/>
acquired small aduantage, yet hath subdued his Conquerer, in surprising that most heroick Prince <hi>Sadony,</hi> whome nowhe lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth prisoner to <hi>Cassidony:</hi> but what auailes sorrowe, where sadnes cannot helpe, and though I now enioy your companye, which is a heauen vnto my soule, and a paradice vnto my mind, yet since the cause was mine, the quarrell mine, and he himself was mine: with what honor or iust excuse, can or may I suffer him to endure imprisonment, and liue my selfe free and out of bondage? (pardon me O gracious Quéene) and with your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ioyntly giue me leaue to recouer him again, without whom neither may my hart receiue content, neither my soule comfort: and the time shall not be long, vntill I make my speedy returne to visite you, whom aliue aboue all wights I honor, and whome after death I vowe as my cheefest saint to adore.</p>
               <p>When the proude Lady in loue faire <hi>Eglantine,</hi> had till this instant remained as it were in a traunce, yet listened to this sad and heauy discourse of <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> where at the first a wan and pale hew had wholy possessed her amiable face, by reason of her inward passions: now the orient vermillion spreading on her cheekes, stroue (as it were) with the Rose and Lillie for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority in the perfection of colour, she calling her sences toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, made this reply. Ah poore and distressed Quéene, how often in my greatest mishaps was I wont to alledge against fortune, when she threatned vtterly to depriue me of honor, liuing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, yea life and all, that none of al that was mine, claiming onely a property in thy loue and loyaltie (O noble Knight <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardine</hi>) not caring to forgoe the whole worlde so I might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy thée whome I thought that neither alteration of time, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of place, mutation of manners, change of estate, no nor any thing whatsoeuer which either hell or fortune might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, could once haue seperated and withdrawne from me, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing now such liberty and freedome to stay:) but seeing that my expectation failes me, and that I striue against the streame, and east stones against the winde, in reconciling you, and opposing my selfe against fortune, who long since hath vowed my vtter ruine: ah too true I finde, that the constellation of my starres,
<pb facs="tcp:4844:53"/>
with the calculation of my natiuitie, haue still alotted me, with <hi>Ixion</hi> to be rolled on the tormenting whéele, dayly to turne the stone with <hi>Sisiphus,</hi> and for euer to fill the bottomlesse tubs with the daughters of <hi>Belus:</hi> the ashes of the olde Phenix ingender a new, and with me the end of one sorrowe is the beginning of another: if fortune looke on me she lowreth, if she turne her face, she threatneth: if she but remember me, she is enraged: and if she smile, she meaneth naught but deceit and slatterye. And yet how can I so vehemently exclaime against fortune? hath she not rescued me from the Pagans tirannies? hath she not preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued my swéete <hi>Blanchardine</hi> from shipwrack, imprisonment, and death? hath she not giuen me the conquest and ouerthrow of my enemies? Alas she hath, but so soone to depriue me of thy swéet company, augmenteth my gréefes a thousand times more, then these haue exhillerated me with pleasure: yet since there is no remedy and that you needes will wend from hence to hazard your life and people, in rescuing him (whome I thinke they haue already put to death) and leaue me (to whom your absence will bring a discontentment worse then death) goe <hi>Blanchardine</hi> goe, and in your absence I will mourne, wéepe, and wring my hands, (but withall) neuer cease to entreate the Gods for your speedy returne: and yet before you goe, let vs congratulate our selues as well as we may, and so short a time will permit: and after you haue put on the Princely Diadem of <hi>Tormaday,</hi> and establisht all things according to your grauety and wisedome, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (I say) may you at your pleasure departe, and leaue me héere to bewaile my hard misfortune.</p>
               <p>Thus this poore passionate Quéene sometime with sighes, sometime with teares, solicited him to stay, but his brotherly care of <hi>Sadony</hi> farre exceeded the Quéenes perswasions. So pacing louingly with her into the Cittie, which he found most sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslye adorned against his comming, he sported with his fayre Quéene a day or two, till his shipping was in a readines, and then with a warlike company of braue Caualiers, he bent his course after the Pagan <hi>Alimodes,</hi> and his miscreant company: but before he ascended the Ship, he in presence of the Queene
<pb facs="tcp:4844:54"/>
and her Lords, called vnto him a man (whome as he thought was highest in the Princes fauour) but yet of base and meane parentage, onely aduanced to honor by the late deceased King of <hi>Tormaday,</hi> Father to the Quéene, whose aduice and councel he continually vsed before al the Lords of his kingdome, his name was <hi>Subbyon,</hi> whose pride and haughtye minde, procured him much hatred among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nobles, but by reason of his offices which he helde vnder the Quéene, by the appointment of her father, the common and baser sorte of people, (more for feare then loue) did reuerence: whome <hi>Blanchardine</hi> by reason of his short abode, chose rather by his eye then by experience, to be vicegerent of the Cittie and kingdome till his returne: this hee did (as hee thought) to please the Quéene, &amp; appointed a hundreth knightes daily to attend his person and commaund. When <hi>Blanchardine</hi> had disposed (as ha thought) all things according to the Quéenes desire, after millions of kisses, and sweet imbracements of the faire <hi>Eglantine,</hi> with wéeping teares hee departed towardes his ships.</p>
               <p>Then the aged king of <hi>Frize,</hi> father to <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> séeing the pitifull complaints of the Quéene, recomforted her as well as he could, promising after the obtaining of their enterprize, to bring againe withall spéed his sonne vnto her. Ah God graunt (answered the Quéene) that all thinges sort vnto your wils, for in your absence is my death, and in your presence is my ioy.</p>
               <p>Then the King of <hi>Frize</hi> and all the rest went aboord their ships, the ankers were halled, the sayles were hoised, and foorth they launcht into the déep, where after a daies saile, they might escry afar off, a mightie nauy of shippes, glyding on the waues, whereof newes being brought to <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> he commaunded that presently the maisters should post after them, thinking it to be the fléete of <hi>Alimodes.</hi> But when the industryous Pilotts thought to reach the other company, they were presently ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a mighty tempest, which put them without their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, and in great peril of their liues. The marriners perplexed with the agony and fear of death, could not execute their charge, but encoraged by the captaines of euer shippe, they began to doe

their labour, some turned the sayle yard, others the sayle corde, others strooke the topsayles, others the spritsayle, some the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen sayle, some tooke off the bonnets and enlargements of the mainesayles, some knit the broken lines, and some looked to the hinder decke tayle &amp; castle of the ship, some to the fore decke and some to the hatches, others voyded the sea into the sea by pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the water out of the ships. And to be short, euery man apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him so well to his labour, that they defended the storme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out losse of any.

               <p>This humilitie of the Quéene, with teares distilling downe her chéekes, was such a spur to the forward minds of her nobles, that presently, they marched out at a close postertie of the City through the drytrenches most secretly, till on the sodaine they were come very néere the place of execution.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Sadony</hi> being mounted vp the ladder, by reason whereof he might ouerlooke the resedue, perceiuing this ambush to bee so néere, séeming to eleuate his handes to heauen for mercie, with maine force, brake the handes, where with hee was manakled. And leaping from the ladder, on the sodaine, caught holde on a holberd, which a rude rascall held, and violently wringing it out of his hands, he so bestired his stumps, that hee made the Sari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins recoyle back.</p>

               </p>
               <p>By this time and at that very instant, was the valerous <hi>Blanchardine</hi> with his coragious company, come within the hauen of <hi>Cassidony,</hi> where landing his men, artillery, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he presently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded certaine espialls to scout abroad, to vnderstand the estate of <hi>Cassidony,</hi> and whether <hi>Alimodes</hi> was entred the City or no. By whose industry &amp; diligence, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding a soldier of <hi>Alimodes</hi> host, brought him with speed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> who vpon his examination, confessed the state of <hi>Alimodes,</hi> the rescue of <hi>Sadony,</hi> and the exceeding ioy of faire <hi>Beautrix</hi> for his escape with life, at the instant houre expected of his death. These pleasing newes, sorting to his desire, reuiued the dying corage of <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> for the losse of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon <hi>Sadony.</hi> But now pricked forward with loue and reuenge he dispatched his letters by sundry postes, to aduertise <hi>Sadony</hi> of his arriuall, willing him forthwith, and or euer the enemy were better prouided, to ioyne his forces and assault them, himselfe meaning forthwith to giue the onset.</p>
               <p>These letters being come to the hands of <hi>Sadony,</hi> he presently acquainted the Lordes of <hi>Cassidony,</hi> and faire <hi>Beautrix</hi> with the contents, which they most thankfully accepting, slacked not to performe what pleased <hi>Sadony</hi> to commaund. And forthwith leuying forty thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of expert soldiers, they secretly issued out of the Towne, to ioyne with <hi>Blanchardine</hi> and his company. By this time was <hi>Blanchardine</hi> ready to charge vpon the enemy, which when <hi>Sadony</hi> perceiued, he taried not long to assayle them on the other side.</p>
               <p>So began the fight to be excéeding daungerous: but the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> and prowes of <hi>Sadony,</hi> within short time, brought these wars to end. For <hi>Alimodes</hi> perceiuing his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to fly, and his whole host to bée discomforted, and finding no remedy (by reason of the multitude of his aduersaries to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape) he disarming himselfe, came prostrate before <hi>Blanchardine</hi> pleading his pardon, whome <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> not according to his deserts, but of his accustomed clemencie pittying, deliuered him to the sure custody of a trusty Knight, to remaine his priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:4844:60"/>
till they might further determine vpon him.</p>
               <p>Now was <hi>Sadony</hi> and <hi>Blanchardine</hi> met, betweene whome passed such sweet salutations, &amp; kind imbracementes as brought a singular content and pleasure to all their followers. So loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly arme in arme they paced to the City, where the beautiful <hi>Beautrix</hi> euen at that very entrance met them with such a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant grace, as bright <hi>Phoebus</hi> yéeldes after he hath banished the morning mist. Then through the Citie were proclaimed feasts and triumphes, and al other kinds of sportes, to yéeld a plauditie to this successe, then was the day of Coronation sounded through the land, at which time the Dukes, Lordes, Earles, Barrons, Knights &amp; Gentlemen, from all places, assembled at <hi>Cassidony</hi> to honor the festiualls. The whole assembly made their homage and fealty to <hi>Sadony</hi> &amp; Quéene <hi>Beautrix:</hi> &amp; from that time foorth a quiet and fréendly peace was fully established through that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Blanchardine</hi> had reposed himselfe, and his weary soldiers awhile, in the kind company of <hi>Sadony,</hi> and his faire <hi>Beautrix,</hi> he whome the entire loue of faire <hi>Eglantine</hi> did still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to <hi>Tormaday,</hi> commaunded his ships to be made ready for his returne, ignorant altogether of the treacherous conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Subbion</hi> in his absence, which (if he had knowne) nothing could haue stayd him from her deliuerie and his reuenge.

               <p>When <hi>Blanchardine</hi> had heard the end of his short tale, (it was not néedfull to bid him hast, for presently he certified <hi>Sado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and the Quéene of his vils consperacie, requesting aide from them, to relieue his faire <hi>Eglantine; Sadony</hi> more regarding the comforte of <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> then his croune and dignitie, promised nst only to aide him with men and munition, but also to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie him in person to <hi>Tormaday</hi> and venture his life, in his fréendly quarrell.

but <hi>Subbion</hi> fainting with dastard feare, assured them that their forces were small and not able to make resistaunce by reason of the long and wearie fight, which they had endured all the day before, by whose perswasions, <hi>Siluanus</hi> and his asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siates, were resolutely bent to performe their deuised stratagem.

Cupid was incomparable, and peeuish conceit in leue, most absurd, had nowe entred the chapter house of his mother <hi>Venus,</hi> being limed in the bush of <hi>Blanchardines</hi> beauty, whose large commendations and magnanimious corage was caryed by the swift winges of flying fame throughout many Realmes and prouinces, the like before was sildome or neuer heard. These kings (I say) whose fancies before that time had receiued the perfect impression of loue in the Angellike beautie of that Princely Quéene, whose amber lockes trust vp in golden tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, was a sufficient addamant to draw all Iron hearts vnto her: now séeing all hope of her recouerie past, and their desires frustrate, with franke and fréendly consent, not only came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit and veiw <hi>Blanchardine,</hi> but also brought such honorable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentes and Kingly Iuels to welcome him to <hi>Tormaday,</hi> and to congratulate the happie mariage betwéene him and the faire Princesse <hi>Eglantine,</hi> as their Countries and kingdomes did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.

perceiuing sorrow to be both needlesse and bootlesse, so well as the time and this hard occasion would permit, he began to be more chéerefull, and so pacing toward the Quéene with a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering smile, neither presaging mirth nor mourning, he began to recomfort her. How now faire loue? what, are your melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholies such, as nothing can make you merrie? swéete hart be pacified, and snake of these vntimelye passions, and learne by me to disgest the hard and harsh pilles of vnhappie fortune. The cause is mine, and if sorrow be expected in any, it is I that must be sorrowfull: but I haue found it both hurtfull to my body, and not auaileable to the dead: and therefore haue shaken it of as a thing of no regarde. Let vs not therefore (sweete wife) be the cause of a mournfull courte, but the authors of merry compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, since it hath pleased God to sorte our haps to our harts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments in our happy wedding.

and that now there remaineth no more seruice for me to doe in defence of your royall person, your Realme and Quéene: and that my princely Quéene languisheth at home, by reason of my long absence, whose princely person is the true Idea of my thought: let me craue fauor to depart vntill occasion, or your fréendly letters call me hether againe, where and when, I will not faile so long as life shall rest within me, to do you all possible fauor and kindnes. <hi>Blanchardine</hi> (imagining by himselfe) that the sting of loue was a sufficient pricke to call <hi>Sadony</hi> home, and that he should greatly iniury him &amp; his faire <hi>Beautrix,</hi> in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them a sunder: not onely gaue his consent for his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but with all honor accompanied him to his ships, with his Princely <hi>Eglantine,</hi> where not without millions of teares and many kind imbracements they parted companie.</p>

But after many kinde curtesies and amiable imbracentents betwéene <hi>Sadony</hi> and his <hi>Beautrix</hi> and the Lordes and Ladies, where euery one stroue with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to welcome home her loue, they repaired to the court, where for that night, the King and his Quéene spent the time in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and al the rest congratulated their happy meetings. On the morrow when glorious <hi>Phoebus</hi> began to cut the cloudes, and drewe the darknes from the earth, euery one prepared himselfe to be ready to attend the princes pleasure.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Sadony</hi> had royally presented himselfe to the veiw of all, giuing a princely boniure to the Lordes and nobles, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that the soldiers whose trauels had béene great, should repaire to his presence, to receiue a recompence for their paines, which bountie did so combine the trustie minds of all vnto him, that base was he accompted, that would refuse to hazard his life where and when it pleased <hi>Sadony</hi> to commaund. Then were the lawes which in his absence the Quéene and Counsell had deuised, presented to him to ratifie, which he w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> all princely magnificencie did forthwith establish, to the great admiration and singuler content of all his subiectes and people. Now tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling swift winged fame, the spéedy messenger of happie newes, ceased not vntill these tidinges were brought to the eares of the King of <hi>Spruse</hi> at the cittie <hi>Marienbourgh</hi> (then in his profound and deep meditations for his sonne <hi>Sadony</hi>) and his departed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. But when he heard of the hard aduentures which his sonne had escaped by sea, his deliuerie from death on land, and his most happy marriage with the beautifull <hi>Beautrix,</hi> vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feare (whose cankering rust had almost consumed his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) hee with all his nobles and people, offered burnt sacrifices to their Mahon for this happie tidings: Yet not content nor sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he rigged certaine ships wherein he and diuers of his Lordes embarqued themselues, longing to visite his son at <hi>Cassidomet</hi> and led by this sweete desire, after they had say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the space of one wéeke, they came ashore within those territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: But when newes was brought to <hi>Sadony</hi> that certaine

Pagans were arriued, and craued to bee admitted his princely presence: Ignorant altogether what or whence they shoulde be: seating himselfe in his Royall throne, accompanied with his faire Queene and chiefe peeres, hee commaunded them to bee brought to his presence, vpon whose approche, <hi>Sadony</hi> knowing his father, by the maiestie of his countenaunce, desended from his seate, humbling himselfe on his knees at his fathers feete. The faire <hi>Beautrix</hi> vnwitting who he might be, to whome <hi>Sado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> should shewe such reuerence, stood in a maze: But after she knew him to be father to <hi>Sadony,</hi> with a most gracious and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable chéere came to entertaine him, to whome the King of <hi>Spruse</hi> rendred millions of thankes, both for the life and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his sonne, without whose rescue hee had bin traiterously murdred, and hanged by <hi>Alimodes.</hi> But the faire Quéene an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that both her life, liuing, and people rested in the safetie of <hi>Sadony,</hi> without whome (quoth shée) neyther may I, nor my kingdome continue: Now when the King of <hi>Spruse</hi> had listened to her zealous and sugred tale, fixing a stedfast countenaunce on her face, he seemed as one rauished in contemplation, admiring the beauty and bounty of the Queene. But <hi>Sadony,</hi> thinking his father (after his ariual from sea) to be desirous to repose himself, led him with all maiestie into a most princely lodging: where after his repast, he went to bed: the other Lords of his troope and all their followers were so honorably entertained there, that the commendation of <hi>Sadonies</hi> bountie, was bruted euery where. Now on the next morning when (according to custome) <hi>Sadony</hi> and his faire Quéene, repaired to the Church, to heare deuine seruice, the King of <hi>Spruse</hi> not suspecting that his Sonne <hi>Sadony</hi> had altered his religion from his Mahomet: after the Priestes had begun to sing a sollemne procession in the honor of Christ, he as a man distraught in sence, and ouercome with madding fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy, ran vp and downe cursing and exclaiming against his sonne, so that neither perswasions, teares, vowes, nor praiers might once appease his franticke rage: till retiring himself all sollitary into his chamber, tormented with passions &amp; agonies, at length he fell a sleep, to whome a little after entred diuers of the Lordes

which accompanied <hi>Sadonie</hi> from <hi>Marienbrough</hi> with <hi>Blanchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> and perswaded the King that the idolatrous Mahomet was a false deceauer and of no diety, which by sundry and wonderfull miracles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they had founde Christ to be the true Messias and sonne of God: and therefore with all humilitie, ioyntly on their knées they entreated his maiestie, to leaue his superstitious worshipping of blockish Mahomet, and with all deuotion to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Christ to be the true God: And euen at that very instant the stony heart of this Pagan King was mollified, who forsaking his idolatrie, became a christian. This happie newes so delighted his sonne, that vnder heauen nothing could worke him more content: Then laboured <hi>Sadony</hi> and his faire Quéene with all royaltie, to welcome their father and his followers, where their entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was excéeding measure, both for mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificencie and cost: So past the time a moneth or more, of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in iollity, vntill the King desirous to returne to <hi>Marien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh,</hi> requested leaue of <hi>Sadony,</hi> for his departure: who séeing the tickle state of his fathers kingdome, in his absence, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a gouernour there, was the more willing, and so all possible prouision being made with princely bounty bestowed by <hi>Sadony</hi> and his <hi>Beautrix</hi> vpon the Lords of <hi>Spruse,</hi> they accompanied the King to his ships: And after humble dutie done by <hi>Sadony</hi> to his father and kinde curteste to the rest, he recommended them to the mercy of <hi>Blanchardines</hi> God.</p>
