         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

taken in the <hi>Title</hi> of this
thin <hi>Volume,</hi> which I have,
in some latitude of Assistance,
Midwiv'd into this our
<hi>English</hi> World; but you shall most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:58581:3"/>
confesse it to be as well a sufficient <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
to my <hi>Industry</hi> and <hi>Cost,</hi> as a full
<hi>Elogie</hi> to <hi>it selfe:</hi> The AVTHOR there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
being one of the fairest Flowers in that
Garland of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> wherewith
this <hi>Century</hi> being meritoriously adorned,
may, without breach of Modesty, take the
right hand of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and stand as well
the <hi>Wonder,</hi> as <hi>Envy</hi> of <hi>Posterity:</hi> and
so gratefully acknowledged by all, whose
Studies and Ingenuity have qualified them
with Judgement enough to profound the
sense of his <hi>Geometry</hi> and <hi>Algebra.</hi> And
its SVBJECT so universally <hi>Gratefull;</hi>
that I dare say, you have not, in all your
Readings, met with the Name of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
except onely <hi>Tacitus</hi> the Emperour,
who was so rude and harsh of Disposition, as
to dislike the <hi>Melody</hi> of <hi>Numbers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the AVTHOR, therefore,
<pb facs="tcp:58581:3"/>
the most your selfe can judge me fit to say, is
only this; that the most becoming Tribute I
can pay unto his <hi>Noble Memory,</hi> is a silent
<hi>Veneration:</hi> it being almost of Necessity,
that a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> on Him from my une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
Pen, be interpreted a kind of implicite
<hi>Diminution;</hi> since it must suppose the
<hi>Height</hi> of His <hi>Merit</hi> to bee commensurable
by the <hi>Digits</hi> of so slender a of <hi>Capacity;</hi> and
few will admit Him for a Competent <hi>Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologist,</hi>
who is, by incomputable distances,
below a due Apprehension of the <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of his <hi>Subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, as for the SVBJECT likewise,
wherewith the <hi>Rationall Soule of Man</hi> is
so Pathetically, and by a kinde of occult
<hi>Magnetisme,</hi> Affected, that even the most
<hi>Rigid</hi> and <hi>Barbarous</hi> have ever Confest it
to be the most potent Charme either to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite,</hi>
or <hi>Compose</hi> the most vehement <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:58581:4"/>
thereof; as <hi>Homer</hi> ingeniously inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
in his Figment, that it was the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the <hi>Gods,</hi> to pacifie their Civil
Dissentions with the Harmony of Musick,
and that the Rough spirited <hi>Achilles,</hi> with
the soft Concordant <hi>Echoes</hi> of his owne
<hi>Harp,</hi> used to Calme the tumultuous aestua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his <hi>Choler;</hi> and as all <hi>Poets</hi> una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
intend, in that they have made the
<hi>Magick</hi> of <hi>Sirens</hi> to consist only in the <hi>sweet
Accents</hi> and <hi>Melotheticall Modulation</hi> of
their <hi>Voices:</hi> Concerning this, I say, it
would sound a mere <hi>Pleonasme</hi> for me, here,
to <hi>Commend</hi> it by any other <hi>Argument,</hi>
but this unfrequent one. That the Sage
and Vpright <hi>Ancients</hi> had <hi>Musick</hi> in so
high <hi>Estimation,</hi> as that, when they would
fully Characterise a <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Sapient</hi>
Person, they called him only <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician:</hi>
and, if his long Study of <hi>Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:58581:4"/>
and the <hi>Liberall Sciences</hi> had raised

of <hi>Numbers,</hi> were the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Diapason</hi> of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
Thus much, besides the expresse Records of
<hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> may be
naturally inferred from hence; that even
the best of our Moderne <hi>Grammarians,</hi>
and <hi>Philologers</hi> derive the word <hi>Musick,</hi>
as also the <hi>Muses,</hi> from the Greeke Verbe,

and this, upon no slender Reason; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

that can remain to me, as the proper <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

observed in the <hi>Latine</hi> Impression,
especialy in the <hi>Figures,</hi> and <hi>Diagramms,</hi>
wherein the Evidence of each respective

<hi>Accurate,</hi> some few <hi>Litteral</hi> Oversights of
the <hi>Press</hi> only excepted, that the Excellent

                     <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> had He lived to see it, would
have acknowledged the <hi>Translator</hi> for a

rawe <hi>Disciple</hi> of his, who having unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
transcribed the <hi>Original,</hi> and divulged
his owne faulty <hi>Copy;</hi> hath often given
occasion not only to the Enemies, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
some of the Defendants of his Masters
Learned Industry, to suppose, that in this

more then Himself clearly understood. And

long labouring his Thoughts in the
strict Examination of the Apodictical Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

Affections in us. For Songs may
bee made dolefull and delightfull at
once: nor is it strange that two divers
effects should result from this one
cause, since thus Elegiographers and Tragoedians please
their Auditors so much the more, by how much the
more griefe they excite in them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>MEANS</hi> conducing to this End, or the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of a Sound are chiefly two; <hi>viz.</hi> the Differences
therof in the reason of Duration or Time, and in the
reason of its intension or modification into Acute or
Grave; for concerning the quality of a Sound, from
what body and how it may procede more gratefull, is
the Argument of Physiologists.</p>
                     <p>This only thing seems to render the voice of Man
the most gratefull of all other sounds; that it holds the
greatest conformity to our spirits. Thus also is the voice
of a Friend more gratefull then of an Enemy, from a
sympathy and dispathy of Affections: by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
perhaps, that it is conceived that a Drum headed
with a Sheeps skin yeelds no sound, though strucken,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58581:10"/>

upon in the same Room.</p>

                     <p>1. EAch Sense is capable of some Delectation.</p>
                     <p>2. To this Delectation is required a certain
proportion of the object to the sense. Hence
comes it, (for instance) that the noise of Thunder, and
the report of Guns are not convenient to Musick: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they offend the Ear, as the too great splendor of
the Sun doth destroy the sight.</p>
                     <p>3. The Object must bee such, as that it fall not upon
the Sense with too great Difficulty and Confusion.
Hence comes it, (for instance) that any Figure excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
implicate, though exactly regular, such is the
Mother in the Astrolabe, is not so pleasant to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
as another consisting of lines more equall; such
as is in the same Net: the reason wherof is, because
the sense doth more fully satisfie it self in the one, then
in the other, wherin are many things which it doth not
perceive sufficiently distinct.</p>
                     <p>4. That Object is more easily perceived by the sense,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in which is found the least Difference [1] of Parts.</p>
                     <p>5. The parts of an Object are said to bee lesse diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
each from other, when they mutually hold the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> greater proportion [2] each to other.</p>
                     <p>6. That proportion ought to be <hi>Arithmeticall,</hi> not
Geometricall. The reason wherof is, because, in that,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58581:10"/>
there are not so many things advertible, since the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
are every where equall: and therfore the sense
suffers not so much labour and defati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
that it may distinctly perceive
all things occurring therin [3]: For 2 <gap reason="music">

example, the proportion of these lines 3 <gap reason="music">

                        </gap>
is more easily distinguished by the eies, 4 <gap reason="music">

then of these

                           <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                        </gap>because in the
first, the sense is required only to advert the Unity for
the difference of each line; but in the second, the parts
AB, and BC, which are incommensurable. And
therfore, I conceive, they can by no means be perfectly
perceived by the sense, together and at once, but only
in order to a proportion <hi>Arithmeticall;</hi> so that it may
advert in the part AB two parts, [5], wherof three [6]<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
are existent in BC; wherin it is manifest, that the sense <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
is perpetually deceived.</p>
                     <p>7. Among Objects of the sense, that is not most
gratefull to the Mind, which is most easily perceived by
the sense; nor that, on the contrary, which is with the
most difficulty apprehended: but that which is perceived
not so easily, as that that naturall desire, wherby the
senses are carried towards their proper Objects, is not
therby totally fulfilled; nor yet so hardly, as that the
sense is therby tired.</p>
                     <p>8. Finally, it is to be observed, that <hi>Variety,</hi> is most
gratefull in all things. These Propositions conceded, let
us consider the first <hi>Affection</hi> of a Sound.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>TIme,</hi> in Sounds, ought to consist of equall Parts;
because such are the most easily of all others
perceived by the sence, (according to the fourth
Praeconsiderable:) or of Parts which are in a double or
triple proportion, nor is there any further progression
allowable; because such are of all others the most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
distinguished by the ear, (according to the fifth and
sixth Praeconsiderables.) For, if the measures were
more unequall, the Hearing could not apprehend their
differences without labour and trouble, as experience
witnesseth: For, if against one note we should place
(for instance) five equall ones; it could not be sung with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
extream difficulty.</p>
                     <p>You object, that four Notes may be placed against
one, or eight; and therefore a farther progression may
be made to these Numbers. We answer, that these
Numbers are not the first among themselves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doe not generate new proportions; but only mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
a double: which is constant from hence, that they
cannot be set unlesse combinated, nor can we set such
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Notes [7] alone, <gap reason="music">
                           <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                        </gap> where the second is the
fourth part of the first:</p>
                     <p>But thus, <gap reason="music">
                           <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                        </gap> where the last seconds are the
half part of the first, and so there is only a
double proportion multiplyed.</p>
                     <p>From these two kinds of proportions in Time, there
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58581:11"/>
arise two kinds of Measures in Musick: namely by a
Division into Three in time, or into Two. But, this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
is noted by a percussion, or stroke, as they call it;
which is ordained to assist our Imagination, that so we
may the more easily perceive all the members of the
Tune, and be delighted with the proportion, which
ought to be in them. Now, this proportion is most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
kept in the members of the Tune, in order to
the helping of our Imagination, so that while we yet
heare the last of the time, we may remember what was
in the first, and what was in the rest of the Tune. Which
is effected, if the whole Tune be composed of 8, or 16,
or 32, or 64, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> members: so that all Divisions may
proceed from a double proportion. For then, when we
have heard the Two first members, we apprehend them
as one, while yet wee conjoyne the Third member
with the First, so that the proportion becomes triple:
afterward, when we have heard the Fourth, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
it with the Third, and so apprehend it as one and
the same. Then we again conjoyn the Two First with
the Two Last, and so apprehend those Four together as
One. And thus doth our Imagination proceed even to
the end: where at length it conceives the whole Tune,
as one intire thing composed of many equall members.</p>
                     <p>Few have understood, how this Measure can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to the ears without a percussion, or stroke, in
Musick, very diminute and of many voyces. This we
say is effected only by a certain intension of the <hi>Spirit</hi> or
breath, in <hi>Vocall</hi> Musick; or of the <hi>Touch,</hi> in <hi>Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:</hi>
so as from the beginning of each stroke, the sound
is emitted more distinctly. Which all Singers natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observe, and those who play on Instruments; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58581:12"/>
in Tunes, at whose numbers we are wont to dance
and leap: for, this Rule is there kept, that we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
every stroke of the Musick, with a single mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our bodies; to the doing of which we are also
naturally impelled by Musick. For certain it is, that a
sound doth concusse, or shake all circumjacent bodies,
as is exemplified in <hi>Thunder,</hi> and the ringing of <hi>Bells;</hi>
the reason whereof is to be referred to the disquisition
of <hi>Physiology.</hi> But, insomuch as the <hi>Hoti</hi> is confest by all
men, and that the sound is emitted more strongly, and
distinctly in the beginning of each Measure, as we have
formerly hinted: we may well affirm, that that sound
doth more smartly and violently concusse or agitate our
Spirits, by which we are excited to motion; as also by
consequence, that <hi>Beasts</hi> may dance to number, or keep
time with their Feet, if they be taught and accustomed
thereto; because to this, nothing more is required, then
only a mere naturall <hi>Impetus,</hi> or pleasant violence.</p>
                     <p>Now, concerning those various Affections, or Passions,
which Musick, by its various Measures can excite in us;
we say, in the Generall, that a slow measure doth excite
in us gentle, and sluggish motions, such as a kind of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor,
Sadnesse, Fear, Pride, and other heavy, and dull
Passions: and a more nimble and swift measure doth,
proportionately, excite more nimble and sprightly Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
such as Joy, Anger, Courage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The same may
be also sayd of the double kind of percussion, <hi>viz.</hi> that
a <hi>Quadrate,</hi> or such as is perpetually resolved into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals,
is slower and duller, then a <hi>Tertiate,</hi> or such as
doth consist of Three equal parts. The reason whereof
is, because this doth more possesse and imploy the sence,
inasmuch as therein are more (namely 3) members to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58581:12"/>
be adverted, while in the other are only 2. but a more
exact &amp; ample disquisition of this rare secret, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the exquisite cognition of the <hi>Motions</hi> of the
<hi>Minde;</hi> of which this place is uncapable.</p>
                     <p>However, we shall not omit, that so great is the force
of <hi>Time</hi> in Musick, as that it alone can of it selfe adfer a
certain <hi>Delectation;</hi> as is experimented in that Military
Instrument, the <hi>Drum,</hi> wherein nothing else is required
then meerly measure of Time; which therefore (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
cannot there be composed of only 2, or 3 Parts,
but also of 5, or perhaps 7 others. For since in such an
Instrument the sence hath nothing else to take notice
of, but bare Time: therefore in Time may be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Diversity,</hi> that so it may the more exercise and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the sence.</p>

                     <p>THis may be considered chiefly in three manners,
or wayes; either in sounds which are emitted
at once and together from divers bodies; or in
those which are emitted successively from the same

from divers voyces, or sonorous bodies. From the first
manner, arise <hi>Consonancies:</hi> from the second, <hi>Degrees:</hi>
from the third, <hi>Dissonancies,</hi> which come nearer to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancies.
Where it is manifest that in Consonancies the
Diversity of Sounds ought to be lesse, than in Degrees;
because that would more tire, and disgust the Hearing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58581:13"/>
in sounds, which are together emitted, then in those that
are emitted successively. The same also, in proportion,
may be affirmed concerning the Difference of Degrees
from such Dissonancies, as are tolerated in relation.</p>

                     <p>FIrst, we are to observe, that an Unison is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonance;
because therein is no Difference of
Sounds, as to Acute and Grave: but that it bears
the same relation to Consonances, that Unity doth to
Numbers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that of two Terms, required in Consonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that which is the more Grave, is far the more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and doth in a manner contain the other Term in
it selfe: as is manifest in the Nerves of a Lute, of which
when any one is percussed, those strings, which are an
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighth, or Fifth more acute [8], tremble and resound
of their own accord; but those which are more Grave
do not, at least do not appear to the sence so to do; the
Reason whereof is thus demonstrated. <hi>One sound bears
the same respect to another sound, that one string bears to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
string:</hi> but in every string that is greater, all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
strings, that are lesse, are comprehended; though
every string that is longer, doth not comprehend all the
others, that are shorter: and therfore also in every Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Sound, all others more Acute are comprehended;
but not, on the contrary, in every Acuter Sound are the
more Grave comprehended: whence it is evident, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58581:13"/>
the more Acute Termis to be found by the Division of
the more Grave. Which Division that it ought to be
Arithmeticall, <hi>i. e.</hi> into equall parts, is consequent

                     </p>
                     <p>Let, therfore, <hi>AB</hi> bee the more Grave Term, in
which if I would find the Acuter Term of all the first
Consonances, I must divide it by the first of all Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<hi>viz.</hi> by 2, as is done in <hi>C;</hi> and then <hi>AC, AB,</hi> are
distant each from other, the first of all the Consonances,
which is called an Eighth and Diapason. Further,
would I have other Consonances, which immediately
follow the first; I must divide <hi>AB</hi> into three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
parts; and then I shall have not only one Acute
Term, but two, <hi>viz. AD,</hi> and <hi>AE,</hi> from which there
will arise two Consonances of the same kind, <hi>viz.</hi> a
Twelfth, and a Fifth. Again, I can subdivide the line
<hi>AB</hi> into 4, or 5, or 6 parts, but no further; because
such is the imbecillity of the Ears, as that they cannot

                     <head type="sub">Of an Eighth.</head>
                     <p>THat this is the first of all Consonances, and that
which is the most easily, perceived by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after an <hi>Vnison;</hi> is manifest from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and also comprobated by experiment in Pipes:
which, when blown with a breath stronger than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
instantly yield a sound more Acute one Eighth.
Nor is there any reason, why that sound should imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
arise to an Eighth, rather then to a Fifth, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Note; unlesse because an Eighth is the first
of all Consonances, and that which is the least different
from an Unison. From whence, we conceive, it doth
also follow, that no sound can be heard, but it seems in
some sort to resound in the ear more Acute an Eighth:
and that this is also the cause, why in a Lute to the
greater strings, which give Graver sounds, other smaller
strings more Acute one Eighth are consociated, which
are alwayes percussed at the same instant, and so effect
that the Graver sounds are heard more distinctly.
Whence it is manifest, that no sound which shall be
consonant to one Term of an Eighth, can be dissonant
to any other Term of the same Eighth.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>second</hi> thing to be observed concerning an Eighth,
is this; that it is the greatest of all Consonancies, that is,
that all other Consonancies are contained therein; or
composed [11] therof, and of others which are contained <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
therein. Which may be demonstrated from hence, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58581:15"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> all Consonancies consist of equall parts [12]; whence it
comes, that if their Terms be more distant each from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than one Eighth, we may, without any further Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of a more Grave Term, adde one Eighth to a
more Acute, of which, together with the residue, it will
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> appear that that is composed [13]. An Example may
be <hi>AB,</hi> divided into three equall parts, of which <hi>AC,
AB,</hi> are distant by one Twelfth: we say, that Twelfth
is composed of an Eighth, and the residue thereof, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> a Fifth [14]; for composed it is of <hi>AC, AD,</hi> which is
<figure/>
an EighthS; and <hi>AD, AB,</hi> which is a Fifth: and so it
falls out in the rest. Whence it comes, that one Eighth
doth not so multiply the numbers of proportion if it
compose others, as all others do; and is therefore the
only Consonance which is capable of <hi>Gemination,</hi> or
Doubling. For, if it be Geminated, it makes only 4
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/>[15], or 8, if regeminated: but if a Fifth be Geminated,
which is the First after an Eighth, it makes 9
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/>[16]: for from 4, to 6, is a Fifth; in like maner from 6,
to 9; which number is far greater then 4, and exceeds
the series of the first six Numbers, in which we have
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> formerly included all Consonances [17].</p>
                     <p>From this it naturally follows; that of all Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies,
of what kind soever, there are but three Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
one is Simple: another Compound of a Simple
and an Eighth: a third composed of a simple and
2. Eighths. Nor can any other Species be added, which
is composed of 3 Eighths, and another simple Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
because these are the extream limits, nor is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58581:15"/>
there any progression beyond three Eighths; since then
the numbers of Proportions would be multiplyed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively.
From whence is deduced a generall Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of all Consonances whatever, which is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented

                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:58581:16"/>
Here have we added the <hi>Sixth Minor,</hi> which we had
not observed in the precedent Chapter; in regard it
may be educed from what hath been sayd of an Eighth,
from which if a Ditone be cut off, the remainder will
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> be a Sixth Minor [18]. But of this more clearly anon.</p>
                     <p>Wheras we even now affirmed, that all Consonances
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> were comprehended in an Eighth [19]; we are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to inquire how that comes to passe, and how they
proceed from the Division thereof, that so their nature
may be the more plainly and distinctly understood.</p>
                     <p>First, it is most certain, that that Division of an
Eighth, from which all Consonances arise, ought to be
Arithmeticall, or into equall parts: now what that is,
which ought to be divided, is evident in the string <hi>AB,</hi>
which is distant from <hi>AC,</hi> the part <hi>CB;</hi> but the
<figure/>
sound <hi>AB,</hi> differs from the sound <hi>AC,</hi> an Eighth:
therefore will the space of an Eighth be the part <hi>CB.</hi>
That ther<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>e is it, which ought to be divided into two
equalls, that the whole Eighth may be divided, which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> is effected in <hi>D</hi> [20]. From which Division, that we
may understand what Consonance is properly, and <hi>per
se</hi> generated; we are to consider that <hi>AB,</hi> which is the
more grave Term, is divided in <hi>D,</hi> not in order to it self,
for then it would have been divided in <hi>C,</hi> as was done
before: nor, as the Case stands now, is an Unison divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58581:16"/>
but an Octave, which consists of two Terms, and
therefore when the more Grave Term is divided, that
Division is made in order to another more Acute.
Whence it comes that the Consonance properly arising
from the Division, is between the Terms <hi>AC, AD,</hi>
which is a Fifth; not betwixt <hi>AD, AB,</hi> which is a
Fourth: because the part <hi>DB,</hi> is only the residue, and
generates a Consonance by accident; from hence, that
sound which makes a Consonance with one Term of an
Eighth, ought also to make a Consonance with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Again, the space <hi>CB</hi> being divided in <hi>D,</hi> I might by
the same reason divide <hi>CD</hi> in <hi>E</hi> [21]; from whence a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/>
Ditone would be directly generated, and by accident all
the other Consonances: nor is it requisite that <hi>CE</hi> be
further divided; yet if that were done, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>F</hi> [22],<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/>
then would from thence arise a greater Tone, and by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
a lesser Tone, and the Semitones [23], of which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/>
hereafter: for, in a voyce, they are successively admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but not in Consonances.</p>
                     <p>Nor let any think it imaginary, what we say, that
only a Fifth and a Ditone are generated from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of an Eighth properly, and all other Consonances
by Accident; for Experience teacheth the same in the
strings of a Lute or other Instrument, whereof if one be
stroke, the force of that sound will strike all the other
strings which shall be more Acute in any kind of Fifth
or Ditone: but in the others which are distant a Fourth,
or other Consonance, the same shal not happen. Which
force of Consonances must undoubtedly arise from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58581:17"/>
hence, either from their Perfection, or Imperfection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as these are first Consonances of themselves, but
all others are only by Accident, because they necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flow from others.</p>
                     <p>But let us enquire, whether that be true, which we
formerly sayd, <hi>Viz.</hi> That all Simple Consonances are
comprehended in an Eighth: this we shall easily justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
if we shall turn <hi>CB,</hi> the halfe of <hi>AB,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
an Eighth, into a Circle; so that the poynt <hi>B</hi> may
be joyned to the poynt <hi>C.</hi> Then let the Circle be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in <hi>D</hi> and <hi>E,</hi> as it was divided in <hi>CB:</hi> and the reason
why all the Consonances ought so to be found out, is
because no sound can be consonant to one Term of an
Eighth, but it must also be consonant to the other
Term of the same, as we have already proved. From
whence it comes, that if in the subsequent Figure one
part of the Circle make a Consonance; the residue
must also eontain some Consonance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58581:17"/>
                        <figure>
                           <p>Third Figure.</p>
                        </figure>
                     </p>
                     <p>From this Figure it is demonstrated how rightly an
Eighth is named Diapasson, because it comprehends in
it selfe all the intervalls of other Consonances. Here we
have exhibited only Simple Consonances; where if we
would find out also Compound ones, all we are to do is
only to adde, to the intervalls above described, one or
two whole Circles; and then it will appear that an
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58581:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Eighth doth compose all Consonances.</p>
                     <p>From what hath praeceded, we collect that all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonances
may be referred to Three Kinds; for (1) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they arise from the first Division of an Unison,
such are those which are called Eighths, which make
the First Genus: or (2) they arise from the Division of
an Eighth into two equall parts, such are Fifths and
Fourths, which we may therefore call Consonances of
the Second Division: or (3) they arise from the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a Fifth, which are Consonances of the Third and
last kind. We again divide them into such Consonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as arise from those Divisions <hi>per se;</hi> and those
which arise <hi>per Accidens;</hi> and that there are only three
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Consonances <hi>per se</hi> [24], we have formerly sayd, which
may be confirmed from the First Figure, in which
we extracted the Consonances from the Numbers
themselves: For therein we are to take notice, that
there are only three sonorous Numbers, 2, 3, and 5
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>[25], for the number 4, and number 6. are compounded
of them, and are therefore sonorous numbers only by
Accident, as doth there appear; where, in a right order
and a streight line, they do not generate new Consonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but only such are composed from the former: for
example, 4 generates a Fifteenth, and 6 a Nineteenth;
but <hi>per Accidens</hi> and in a transvers line, 4 generates a
Fourth, and 6 a Third lesser; where we are to observe
by the By, that in the Number 4, a Fourth is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
generated from an Eighth, and is in a manner a
certain Monster, or difficient and imperfect Product of
an Eighth [26].</p>

perfection of Consonances from <hi>Division,</hi> or from <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
[28]; there can properly be found only three <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/>
Consonances, among which the fifth hath the middle
place; this (certainly) is it which resounds in the ears not
so sharply as a <hi>Ditone,</hi> nor so languid as a <hi>Diapasson,</hi> but
the most pleasant of all others. Further, from the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Figure</hi> it appears, that there are three kinds of a
Fifth [29], where the Twelfth possesses the mean place,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/>
which we may therefore affirm to be the most perfect
Fifth: from whence it follows, that we might use no
other Consonance in Musick, if it were not, as we infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the last Praeconsiderable, that Variety was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to <hi>Delectation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be objected, that, in some cases, an Eighth may be
set alone in Musick, without any Variety; as, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
when two voyces sing the same Tune, one more
acute than the other in an Eighth: but the same doth
not evene in a Fifth; and therefore it follows, that an
Eighth ought to be accounted the most gratefull of all
Consonances, rather than a Fifth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:58581:19"/>
We answer, that, from this Instance, our Assertion is
rather confirmed, than infirmed; for the reason, why
an Eighth may be so set, is, because it comprehends an
Unison in it selfe, and so those two voyces resound in
the eare as one; which happens not in a Fifth, whose
Terms are more different among themselves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
possesse, and exercise the Hearing more fully; from
whence a certain weariness and loathing would arise
forthwith, if it were set alone, and without Variety in
Tunes. This may be exemplified thus; we should be
sooner weary if we were constantly fed with Sugar, and
Sweat-meats, than if with bread alone; which every
man will allow not, in any proportion, comparable for
sweetness and blandishment of the palate, to Sugar.</p>

                     <p>THis, of all Consonances, is the most unhappy; nor
is it ever used in Tunes, unlesse by Accident, and
with the assistance of others: not that it is more

the understanding of which, we are to note, that a Fifth

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> what we have sayd [30], that in an Unison, there is, in

it is evident, why a Fourth cannot be set in Tunes,
primarily, and <hi>per se, i. e.</hi> betwixt a Basse and another

necessary in Musick, only in order to the variation of a
Fifth; certainly, it is evident, that a Fourth would be
uselesse, in regard it cannot vary a Fifth: which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from hence; that, if it were set in a more Grave

where the Hearing would soon perceive that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed

a Fourth would bee most harsh and unpleasant thereto,

                     <p>THat a <hi>Ditone</hi> is, by many degrees, more perfect
than a Fourth, is manifest from the Premises; to
which, neverthelesse, we shall adde this; that the
Perfection of any Consonance is not to be desumded
precisely, from the same, while it is Simple; but also from
all the Compounds thereof: the reason whereof is,
that it can never be heard alone so jejune and empty, but
the resonance of this composed is also heard together
with it; since that, in an Unisont, he resonance of a more
Acute Eighth is contained, we have formerly evicted.
Now, that a Ditone, so considered, doth consist of les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> Numbers than a Fourth [31], and is therefore more
perfect than a Fourth; is plain from the <hi>Second Figure:</hi>
wherein we, therefore, placed a Ditone before a Fourth,
insomuch as we endeavoured, in that Figure, to place all
Consonances according to the order of Perfection.</p>
                     <p>But here we are obliged to explain, why the third
<hi>Genus</hi> of a Ditone is the most perfect, and makes, in the
strings of a Lute, a Tremulation perceptible even by the
sight; rather than the First, or Second Genus: which
we conceive to proceed from hence; that this Third
doth consist in a <hi>multiplyed Proportion,</hi> but the First in a
super-particular, the Second in a multiplyed and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>particular,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> together [32]. And why, from multiplyed
proportion the most perfect Consonances do arise;
which we therefore placed in the First order of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58581:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>First Figure,</hi> we thus demonstrate.</p>
                     <p>Let the Line <hi>AB</hi> be distant from <hi>CD,</hi> in the Third
Genus of a Ditone, howsoever men shall imagine the
sound to be perceived by the Hearing; certain it is
that it is more easie to distinguish what is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<hi>For Example,</hi> 
                        <figure/>
betweene <hi>AB</hi> and <hi>CD,</hi> than betweene <hi>CF</hi>
and <hi>CD;</hi> beeause it will first bee knowne direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the application of the sound <hi>AB,</hi> to the parts
of the sound <hi>CD, viz. Ce, ef, fg, &amp;c.</hi> nor will there be
any residue in the end: which falls not alike in the
proportion of the sound <hi>Cf,</hi> to <hi>CD;</hi> for if <hi>Cf</hi> be applyed
to <hi>fh,</hi> there will be the residue <hi>hD,</hi> by the reflection of
which we ought to know what is the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Cf</hi> &amp; <hi>CD,</hi> which is more difficult or tedious. By
the same way will it be conceived, if any say that a
sound doth strike the ears with many percussions or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations,
and that by so much the more swiftly, by
how much the more acute the sound is; for then, that
the sound <hi>AB</hi> may arrive at the requisite Uniformity
with the sound <hi>CD,</hi> it ought to strike the ears with on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
five touches or verberations, while <hi>CD</hi> strikes only
once: but the sound <hi>Cf</hi> will not so soone returne to an
Unisonance, for that cannot be done but after the second
stroke of the sound <hi>CD,</hi> as is described in the superiour
Demonstration. The same will also be explained, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we conceive the sound to be heard.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Third Minor</hi> ariseth from a Ditone, as a Fourth
from a Fifth [33], and is therefore more imperfect than <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:58581:21"/>
a Fourth, as a Ditone, is than a Fifth. Nor is it
therefore to bee excluded Musick, since it is not
onely not uselesse, but even necessary, in order
to the variation of a Fifth. For, since an Eighth is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
heard in an Unison, it cannot adfer this variety;
nor a Ditone alone, (for there can be no variety unlesse
betwixt Two, at least:) therfore is a Third Minor asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
thereto, to the end that such Tunes, wherein Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tones
are more frequent, may be distinct from such as
have a Third Minor very often iterated in them.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Sixth Major</hi> proceeds from a Ditone, and by the
same reason participateth the nature thereof, as a Tenth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> Major, and Seventeenth [34]: to the understanding of
which, we are to look back upon the First Figure,
where, in the number Foure, are found a Fifteenth, an
Eighth, and a Fourth, which is the First Compound
Number, and which, by a Binary, (which representeth
an Eighth,) is resolved even into an Unity; whence it
comes that all Consonances generated from it, are apt
and convenient for Composition, among which since a
Fourth is found, (which, for that respect, we formerly
called a Monster, or defective Eighth;) thence doth it
follow, that the same is not unprofitable in compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where the same reasons do not recur, which hinder
it from being set alone; for then is it perfected by the
adjunct, and remains no longer subject to a Fifth,</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Sixth Minor</hi> proceeds from a Third Minor, in the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> same manner as a Sixth Major doth from a Ditone [35],
and so borrows the nature and affections of a Third
Minor: nor is there any reason to countermand it.</p>
                     <p>Here the Series of Consonances would Exact from us
a Discourse concerning their various <hi>Virtues,</hi> as to the

excitement of <hi>Passions:</hi> but a more exact Disquisition
of this, may be collected from the Praecedents; and it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the limits of a <hi>Compendium.</hi> For, so various are
they, and upon so light circumstances supported; that,
a whole Volume would not suffice to perfect their
Theory. This, therefore, shall we only say, that the
chiefest Variety doth arise from these four last; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a Ditone and Sixth Major are more gratefull, more
sprightfull, and exhilarating than a Third and Sixth Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;
as hath been observed by <hi>Practicall Musicions,</hi> and
may be easily deduced from hence, that a Third Minor
is generated from a Ditone only by Accident, but a Sixth
Major <hi>per se,</hi> because it is no other but a Ditone Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</p>

                     <p>FOr two causes chiefly are Degrees required in

than through Consonances.</p>
                     <p>If we consider them in the first capacity; there can
be only Four kinds of Degrees, and no more: For then
they ought to be desumed from the inequality, found

the intervals which make other Consonances:
therefore all Degrees consist in those numbers, the two
first Tones whereof are called Major and Minor, and the
two last are called Semitones, Major and Minor. But
we are to prove that Degrees, considered in this capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are generated from the inequality of Consonances;
which is thus done. So often as there is a transition
made from one Consonance to another, either one
Term is moved single, or both together; and by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these two ways can any such transition be made,
unlesse by those intervals, which design the inequality
betwixt Consonances: Therefore. The first part of the
Minor is thus demonstrated.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/>[37] Let from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>B,</hi>

be a Fifth; and from <hi>A</hi> to
<hi>C,</hi> be a Sixth Minor; and,
of necessity, from <hi>B</hi> to <hi>C</hi> wil
be that difference, which
is betwixt a Fifth and a <gap reason="music">

                        </gap>
Sixth Minor, <hi>viz.</hi> 1/169 as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/>[38]: but that the
Posterior part of the Minor may be proved, wee are to
observe; that wee are not, in sounds, to regard only the
proportion while they are emitted together, but also
while they are emitted successively, so that, as much as
possible, the sound of one Voyce ought to keepe Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
with the immediately praecedent sound of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
voyce; which can never bee effected, if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
did not arise from the inequality of Consonances.
For Example, let <hi>DE</hi> be a Fifth, and let each Term be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58581:22"/>
moved by contrary motions, so that a Third Minor may
be created; if <hi>DF</hi> be an intervall, which doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
from the inequality of a Fourth to a Fifth, <hi>F</hi> cannot,
by relation, be consonant to <hi>E;</hi> but if yea, then it can:
and so likewise in the rest, as may soon be experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Here observe, that as concerning that Relation,
we sayd it ought to be consonant so much as possible:
for alwayes it cannot be, as will appeare in the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Discourse.</p>
                     <p>But if wee consider them in the second Capacity;
namely, how these Degrees may, and ought to bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
in the whole intervall of sounds, that by them
one solitary voyce may be immediately elevated, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed;
then, among the Tones already found out,
those Degrees shall only be accounted Legitimate, into
which the Consonances are immediately divided. To
the manifestation of this, wee are to advert, that every
intervall of sounds is divided into Eighths, whereof one
can by no means differ from another, and therefore that
it is sufficient, if the space of one Eighth be so divided
as that all the Degrees may be obtained: as also, that
that Eighth is already divided into a Ditone, a Third
<hi>minor,</hi> and a Fourth [39], all which evidently follow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/>
from what wee have sayd concerning the last Figure of
the Superior Tractate.</p>
                     <p>Hence also is it manifest, that Degrees cannot divide
a whole Eighth, unlesse they divide a Ditone, a Third
<hi>minor,</hi> and a Fourth; which is thus done. A Ditone
is divided into a Tone <hi>major,</hi> and a Tone <hi>minor</hi> [40]; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
a Third <hi>minor</hi> is divided into a Tone <hi>major,</hi> and a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone
<hi>majus</hi> [41]; a Fourth, into a Third <hi>minor,</hi> and also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/>
a Tone <hi>minor</hi> [42], which Third is again divided into a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:58581:23"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> Tone <hi>major,</hi> and a Semitone <hi>majus</hi> [43]; and so the whole
Eighth doth consist of three Tones <hi>major,</hi> two Tones <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>
and two Semitones <hi>majora;</hi> as is manifest to him
who seriously and exactly perpends their Scheme. And
here we have only three Kinds of Degrees; for a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitone
<hi>minus</hi> is excluded, because it doth not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
divide Consonances, but only a Tone <hi>minor.</hi> As
for Example, if it be sayd that a Ditone doth consist of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> a Tone <hi>major,</hi> and both Semitones [44] (for both Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tones
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> compose a Tone <hi>minor</hi> [45]): but wherefore, will
you say, is not that Degree also admitted, which resul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
from the Division of another, and divides Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
onely <hi>Mediately,</hi> not immediately? our Answer
is, that the Voyce cannot run through so many various
Divisions, and at the same instant be consonant with an
other different voyce, unlesse with extream Difficulty, as
is open to Experiment: besides, a Semitone <hi>minus</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> would then be joyned to a Tone <hi>major</hi> [46], with which
it would create a most unpleasant Dissonance; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> it would between these numbers 64 and 75 [47], and
therefore the voyce could not bee moved through
such an intervall. But, in order to the clearer solution
of this Objection, we are to note;</p>
                     <p>That to the Creation of an Acute sound, is required
a more forcible emission of the breath, or spirit in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Musick; or a stronger percussion of the strings in
instrumentall; than is required to the Creation of a
Grave: which is experimented in the strings of a Lute,
which yield a sound by so much the more Acute, by
how much the more they are distended; as also from
hence, that by a greater force, the Aer is divided into
lesser parts, from which the more Acute sound must of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58581:23"/>
necessity be generated: and from hence it is a direct
Consequence, that by how much the more Acute a
sound is, by so much the more strongly doth it strike
the eares. From this animadversion, I conceive, a true
and chiefe reason may be rendred, wherefore <hi>Degrees
were invented; viz.</hi> least, if the voyce should run through
the Termes of Consonances alone, there would bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them too great a disproportion in the reason of
intension, which would inevitably tire both the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and Singers. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<gap reason="music">
                           <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                        </gap>
would I ascend
from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>B,</hi> because the
sound <hi>B</hi> wil strike the ears
far stronger, than the sound <hi>A,</hi> lest that Disproportion
should be incommodious, the Term <hi>C</hi> is set in the midle,
by which we may, as by a Degree, more easily, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that inequall contention of the breath, ascend to <hi>B.</hi>
From which it is manifest, that Degrees are nothing elss
but a certaine <hi>medium,</hi> interposed betweene the Terms of
Consonances, for the moderation of their inequality; and
that of themselves they have not sweetnesse enough to
satisfie the ears, but are only considerable and usefull in
order to Consonances; so that while the Voyce runs
through one Degree, it leaves the Hearing unsatisfied,
untill it shall have arrived at a Second; which, for that
respect, ought, together with the former Degree, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
a Consonance: and this is sufficient to solve the
praecedent Objection. Moreover, this also is the reason,
why, in a Voyce, successively Degrees are admitted, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Ninths or Sevenths, (which arise from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,)
or others which do consist of lesse Numbers than
Degrees; namely, because intervals of this sort do not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58581:24"/>
divide the least Consonances, nor can they therfore mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
that inequality, which is betwixt their Terms.
More, concerning the invention of <hi>Degrees,</hi> (which arise
from the Division of a Ditone into two parts, as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone
doth from the Division of a Fifth,) might be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added;
and many things from thence be deduced, which
concern their sundry <hi>Perfections:</hi> But it would require
more room than a <hi>Compendium</hi> can afford, and a good
Understanding may infer as much, from what hath prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
concerning <hi>Consonances.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>More requisite it is, that, in the present, we speak of
the Method or Order, in which those Degrees are to
be constituted in the whole space of an Eighth; now
this Order ought to be such, as that a Semitone <hi>majus,</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> may have on each side next to it a Tone <hi>major</hi> [48]; as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> also a Tone <hi>minor</hi> [49], with which this doth compose
a Ditone; and the Semitone a Third <hi>minor,</hi> according
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> to what we have just now observed [50]: but since an
Eighth containeth Two Semitones, and as many Tones
<hi>minor;</hi> that this may be obtained without Fraction, it
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> ought also to containe Foure Tones <hi>major</hi> [51]: Now
because it containes only three, therefore is it necessary,
that, in some place, wee use a certaine Fraction, which
may be the difference betwixt a Tone <hi>major</hi> and a Tone
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/>
                        <hi>minor,</hi> which we nominate a <hi>Schism</hi> [52]; or also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Tone <hi>major</hi> and a Semitone <hi>majus,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> a Semitone <hi>minus</hi> with a <hi>Schism</hi> [53]: to the end,
that by the helpe of these Fractions the same Tone <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi>
may, after a sort, bee made moveable, and so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the office of two Tones; which is easily preceptible
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58581:24"/>
in the Figures here delineated, where we have turned
the whole space of an Eighth into a Circle, after the
same manner, as in the end of the Sixth Chapter.</p>
                     <p>And truely in either of these Figures, every inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall
designeth one Degree, except Two: <hi>viz.</hi> a Schism
in the First, and a Semitone <hi>minus</hi> with a Schism in the
Second: which Two are in some sort moveable, so
that they may bee referred successively to both Degrees
immediately annexed unto it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:58581:25"/>
                        <figure/>
                        <figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:58581:25"/>
Now, manifest it is from these Figures, (1) That, in
the First Figure, there can be no ascention by Degrees
from 288 [54] to 405, unlesse wee emit the midle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/>
Term in some sort tremulous or quavering; so that if
it respect 288, it may seeme to bee 480, but if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
405, then it may seeme to bee 486, <hi>viz.</hi> that with
both it make a Third <hi>minor,</hi> and the difference is so smal
betwixt 480 and 486, that the mobility of that Terme,
which is constituted from both, doth not strike the
Hearing with a Dissonance perceptible.</p>
                     <p>(2) In the Second Figure, after the same reason, we
cannot ascend from the Term 480 to 324, by Degrees;
unlesse wee so expresse the midle Terme, as that, if it
respect 480, it may seem 384; if it respect 324, it may
be 405, that so, with both, it may make a Ditone. But
because betwixt 384 and 405, the difference is so great,
that no voyce can be so tempered of them, as that if it
hold a Consonance with one of the extreams, but it
will appeare exceedingly Dissonant from the other:
therefore is another way to bee sought, by which (the
most of all others) this so great an incommodity may
be, if not totally removed, yet at least greatly diminished.
Now this can be no other way, but what is found and
described in the Superiour Figure, <hi>viz.</hi> by the use of a
Schism: by this means, if wee would goe through the
Terme 405. Wee will remove the Terme <hi>G,</hi> by one
Schism, that it may be 486, no more 480: and if wee
would goe through 384, we will change the Terme <hi>D,</hi>
and 320 shall be in the place of 324, and so shall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
by a Third <hi>minor,</hi> from 384.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:58581:26"/>
From these considerations it is evident, that all the
spaces, through which one voyce solitary may bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
are contained in the First Figure: for, when the
incommodity of the Second Figure is corrected, then
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="55"/> doth it not differ from the First [55]; as is easily depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
                     <p>Evident it is also, that that Order of Tones, which
practicall Musitians call the <hi>Hand,</hi> doth contain all the
Modes, by which Degrees may be ordained; for, that
they are comprehended in the two praecedent Figures,
is formely proved: and that Hand of Practicall Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
doth contain all the Termes of each Precedent Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
as is easily discerned in the following Figure,
in which we have turned that Hand, into a Circle, that
so it might the better be referred to the Superiour Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.
Yet, to the understanding of this Figure, we are
to signifie, that it begins from the Term <hi>F,</hi> where, for
that cause, we have applyed the greatest number, that
thence it might be collected that that Term is of all the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="56"/> most <hi>Grave</hi> [56].</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:58581:26"/>
                        <figure>
                           <p>Figure the Sixth.</p>
                        </figure>
                     </p>
                     <p>That it ought to be so, is inferred from hence; that
wee can begin Divisions from onely two places of the
whole Eighth: so that therein either two Tones may
be set in the first place, and, after one Semitone, three
Tones consequent in the last place; or, on the contrary,
three Tones in the first place, and only two in the last.
And the Term <hi>F</hi> representeth both those two places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58581:27"/>
For, if from thence we go by <hi>b,</hi> only two Tones,
are in the first place: but if by ♯, there will bee three:
Therefore.</p>
                     <p>First, then it is manifest from this Figure, &amp; the second
precedent, that onely Five Spaces are contained in a
whole Eighth, by which the voyce can naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
<hi>i. e.</hi> without any Fraction, or moveable Terme,
which was to bee found out by Art, that it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
further. Whence it came, that those five inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls
should be attributed to a Naturall Voyce, and six
only Voyces were found out to expresse them; <hi>viz. ut,
re, mi, fa, sol, la.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that from <hi>ut</hi> to <hi>re,</hi> is alwayes a Tone <hi>minor;</hi>
from <hi>re</hi> to <hi>mi,</hi> a Tone <hi>major;</hi> from <hi>mi</hi> to <hi>fa,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a Semitone <hi>majus;</hi> from <hi>fa</hi> to <hi>sol,</hi> alwayes a Tone
<hi>major;</hi> and lastly from <hi>sol</hi> to <hi>la,</hi> a Tone <hi>minor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that there can be only two Kinds of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall
Voyce, <hi>viz. b</hi> and ♯: because the space betwixt
<hi>A</hi> and <hi>C,</hi> which is not divided in the Naturall voyce,
can only bee divided by two Modes; so as that a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone
be set in the first place, or the second.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, for what reason these Notes, <hi>ut, re, mi, fa,
sol, la,</hi> are againe repeated in those Artificiall Voyces:
for Example, for, when wee ascend from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>b,</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as there are not other Notes, but <hi>mi</hi> and <hi>fa,</hi> to
signifie a Semitone <hi>majus;</hi> it thence follows, that in <hi>A,
mi</hi> is to be set; and in <hi>b, fa;</hi> and so in other places in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Nor can you say, it had been more convenient to
have invented other Notes; for they would have been
superfluous, since they must have designed the same in
tervalls, which are designed by those Notes in a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
voyce; besides they would have been incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58581:27"/>
because so great a multitude of Notes must have
exceedingly troubled Musicians, as well in setting, as
singing of Tunes.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, how changes may bee made from one
voyce to another, <hi>viz.</hi> by Terms common to two voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
as also, that these voyces are mutually distant by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/>
a Fifth [57]; and that the voyce <hi>b</hi> Flat, is of all the
most Grave, because it begins from the Term <hi>F,</hi> which
we have formerly proved to be the first; and therefore
it is called <hi>b</hi> Flat or Soft, in respect that by how much
any Tone is the more Grave, by so much is it the more
soft and remisse. For to the emission thereof is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the lesse spirit, or breath, as wee have more then
once intimated. And a Naturall voyce is and ought to
be a mean, nor could it rightly be called <hi>Naturall,</hi> if the
voyce were to be elevated, or depressed beyond Medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity,
in the expression thereof. Finally, the voyce ♯,
is called a Quadrate, or Sharp, because it is the most A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
and the opposite to <hi>b</hi> Soft or Flat; as also, because
it divides an Eighth into a Tritone and a Fifth false [58],<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="58"/>
and is therefore lesse sweet than <hi>b</hi> Soft.</p>
                     <p>Some perhaps will object, that this <hi>Hand</hi> is not suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficient
to comprehend all the Changes of Degrees; for,
as in it is shown, how freely we may deflect from a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
voyce, either to <hi>b</hi> Soft, or to ♯; so also ought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
collaterall Orders to bee designed therein, such as
are set in the Sequent Figure; that so it might have
beene free for us also to deflect from <hi>b</hi> Soft, to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
voyce, or to the other part; and so from ♯. Which
is confirmed from hence, that Musicians in Practice fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
use such intervals, which they explicate either
by Diesis, or by <hi>b</hi> Soft, which they therefore remove
from its proper Seat.</p>

                           </expan> ad infinitum:</hi> but, in that <hi>Hand,</hi> ought
to bee expressed the Changes of only one Tune; and
that those are contained within three Orders, is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
from hence, that in every Order only six Terms
are contained, of which two are changed, when a
change is made to the following Order, and so there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
therein only Four Termes of those, which were in
the former; but if a Transition bee againe made to a
Third Order, then will two Degrees of the four prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ones bee changed, and so there will remain onely
two of those which were in the former Order, which
would lastly be taken away in the fourth Order, if the
progresse should be continued unto it, as is visible in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58581:28"/>
Figure: whence it is most evident that the Tune would
not be the same it was in the beginning, since therein
would remaine no Term unchanged. And what is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
concerning the use of <hi>Dieses;</hi> I say, that they doe
not constitute whole Orders, as <hi>b</hi> Soft, or ♯, but consist
only in one Terme, which they elevate (as I conceive)
by one Semitone <hi>minus,</hi> all the other Terms of the Tune
remaining unchanged; now the manner how, and the
reason why this is done, I doe not at present so well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
as to be able sufficiently to explain; nor why,
when only one Note is elevated above <hi>la,</hi> a <hi>b</hi> Soft is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
affixed unto it: which I think may easily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from Practice, if the Numbers of those Degrees,
in which they are used, and of voyces, which with them
make Consonances, bee subducted; and the matter I
judge well worthy a serious Meditation.</p>
                     <p>Finally, here it may be objected, that six voyces. <hi>ut,
re, mi, fa, sol, la,</hi> are superfluous, and only Four may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
since there are only three divers intervall<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
by which way that any Musicall Tune can be sung, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not. But because there is great difference betwixt
the Terms Grave and Acute; and a Grave Term, as is
formerly noted, is much the chiefest: therefore is it
better and more commodious to use divers Notes, than
the same towards an Acute part, and towards a Grave
part.</p>
                     <p>This place requires us to explain the <hi>Practice</hi> of these
Degrees, how Musicall parts are constituted of them,
and by what reason ordinary Musick composed by
practicall hands may be accommodated to what of the
Theory hath been premised; that so all Consonances
and other its intervalls may bee exactly calculated. In
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58581:29"/>
order to our effecting of this, wee are to know, that
Practitioners describe Musick betweene five lines, to
which others also are added, if the Tones of the Tune
bee further extended; and that these Lines are distant
each from other, two Degrees, and therefore that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two of them, one other is alwayes to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
which is omitted for brevity &amp; commodity sake.
Again, since all the Lines are equally distant each from
other, but signifie unequall spaces: therefore are Two
Markes invented, <hi>b</hi> and ♯, one whereof is set in that
chord, which represents the Term <hi>B fa,</hi> ♯ <hi>mi.</hi> Further,
because one Tune doth frequently consist of many parts,
which parts are seperately described; it is not yet
known, from those Marks, <hi>b</hi> and ♯, which of these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts is superior, and which inferior: and therefore
are there three other Marks found out. 𝄢, 𝄡, 𝄞, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="59"/> whereof we have formerly observed [59]. Now that
all these things may be the more manifest, wee have
here placed this following Figure, in which wee have
expressed all the Chords, and removed them each from
other more or lesse, according to the greater or lesser
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> spaces which they denote [60]; that so the proportion
of Consonances might be presented together to the eye.
Besides, wee have made this Figure double, that the
Difference betwixt <hi>b</hi> and ♯, might be visible; nor can
those Tunes, which are to be sung by one, be described
by the other, unlesse all the Tones of these be removed
by a Fourth or Fifth, from their proper Seat, so that
where stands the Term <hi> F ut fa,</hi> there is to be set <hi>C sol
ut fa.</hi>

                     <p>Further than this we are not to goe, for these ought
to be the Terms, since they divide three Eights, within
which all Consonances are included, to which the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Musicians doth accord, for they hardly ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
this space.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now the use of these Numbers is, to teach what
proportion all the Notes hold among themselves, such
as are contained in all the parts of one Tune: for the
sounds of these Notes hold the same proportion one to
another, as the numbers apposed on the same Chords.
So as if the string be divided into 540 equall parts, and
the sound thereof represent the most Grave Term <hi>F:</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58581:30"/>
480 parts of the same string will yield the sound of the
Term G; and so consequently.</p>
                     <p>And here we have ordered 4 degrees of Parts, that
it might appear, how much they ought to bee distant
each from other; not that the Cliffs 𝄢, 𝄡, and 𝄞 are not
often set in other places, which is done according to the
variety of Degrees, which are run over from each part:
but because this Mode seemes to bee the most Naturall,
and is the most frequent.</p>
                     <p>Again, here have we set Numbers only in the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Chords, and so long as they are not removed from
their proper seat; but if Dieses be found in some notes,
or <hi>b,</hi> or ♯, which may remove them from their proper
seats: then are those to be explicated by other Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
whose quantity is to be desumed from other Notes
of other Parts, with which these kinds of Dieses make
a Consonance.</p>

                     <p>Of these there are three kinds [61]: (1) some are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="61"/>

(3) others from the Difference, which is between a Tone

Ninths are nothing else but Degrees compounded of an
Eighth, and Sevenths nothing but the residue of an
Eighth, from which one Degree is detracted; whence
it is manifest, that there are three divers Ninths, and
three Sevenths, because there are three kinds of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;

                     <p>Now, that these Dissonances cannot be avoyded in
sounds successively emitted, among divers parts is most
clear: yet haply any one may enquire, why they ought
not to be admitted in a voyce successive of the same
part equally with Degrees, since it is evident that some
of them are explicated in lesser Numbers than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
themselves, and therefore may seem to bee more
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="64"/> gratefull to the Hearing than Degrees [64]. The soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of which Doubt doth depend on this, which we have
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="65"/> before observed, that a voyce [65] doth require so much
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58581:31"/>
the more intension of the spirit or breath, by how much
the more Acute it is, and therefore Degrees were inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

Acute to the Graye Term: which cannot be performed
by Sevenths or Ninths, as is evident from hence, that
the Termes of these are more distant each from other,

intervall which may not be ingrate to the ears; nor
have they any Consonances very near, from which they
may borrow sweetnesse, as the Praecedent ones have.
Hence comes it, that these last Dissonances ought to be
avoided in relation; at least, when slow and soft Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
is made, and not diminute; for in very diminute
Musick and such as is sung swiftly, the hearing is too
much imployed to take notice of the defects of such
Dissonances: which defect is much more evident from
hence, that they are near to a Fifth, with which the
Hearing therefore compares them, and, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipuous
sweetnesse of this, doth the more clearly discern
the imperfection of those.</p>
                     <p>Here we shall end our explication of all the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a Sound; having first only taken notice, in order
to the probation of what we formerly said, that all the
Variety of sounds, as to Grave and Acute, doth arise
in Musick onely from these Numbers 2, 3, and 5. we
say that all numbers, by which aswell Degrees, as Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
are explicated, are composed of those three, and
by them, division being made, may at length bee resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
even to an unity.</p>

                     <p>FRom the Premises it followes, that we may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any great errour or soloecism, compose Musick,
if we observe these 3 axioms.</p>
                     <p>1. That all sounds which are emitted together, may
be distant each from other, in any Consonance, except a
Fourth, which lowest ought not to be heard, <hi>i.e.</hi> against
a Basse.</p>
                     <p>2. That the same voice be moved successively, only by
Degrees, or Consonances.</p>
                     <p>3. Lastly, That we admit not a Tritone, or Fifth false,
no not so much as in relation.</p>
                     <p>But, for the greater Elegancy and Concinnity, we are
to note these following Rules.</p>
                     <p>1. That wee begin from some one of the most
perfect Consonances; for, so is raised a greater attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than if some jejune and frigid Consonance led up
the Van: or else, most gratefully, from a pause or silence
of one voyce; for when, immediately upon the silence
of one voyce, which began the Tune, another unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
one First invades the ears, the novelty thereof doth
by a kind of potent charm, conjure us to attention. Now,
concerning a Pause we have been hitherto silent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of it self a Pause is nothing, but onely induceth a
certain novity and variety, while the voyce, which was
silent, doth againe begin to sing.</p>
                     <p>2. That two Eights, or two Fifths never immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58581:33"/>
succeed each other. The reason why that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
more expresly in these Consonances than in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is because these are the most perfect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when one of them is heard, then is the Hearing
therewith fully satisfied, and unlesse the attention bee
presently removed from that to another Consonance, it
is wholly occupied by the pleasantnesse thereof, so that
it can little regard the variety, and the (in some sort) fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid
Symphony of the Tune; which happens not in
Thirds and other Consonances, no though they be reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
for in all others the attention is still kept up, and
a desire encreased of expecting a more perfect Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                     <p>3. That so much as possible, the parts goe on in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
motions, in order to the greater variety: for then
both the motion of every voice is distinguished from
the adverse voice, and Consonances are distinguished
from other Consonances near them. Also that all the
voyces be moved oftner by Degrees, than by leaps.</p>
                     <p>4 That, when we would advance from any lesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to a more perfect Consonance, wee alwayes deflect
to one that is near, rather than to one that is remote;
for example, from a Sixth <hi>major</hi> to an Eighth, from a
Sixth <hi>minor</hi> to a Fifth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> understanding the same also
of an Unison and the most perfect Consonances. Now,
the reason why this method is to bee observed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
from imperfect to perfect Consonances, rather
than <hi>e contra,</hi> from perfect to imperfect; is, because,
when we heare an imperfect Consonance, the eares are
induced to expect a more perfect one, wherein they may
receive more satisfaction, and to this expectation are
they carryed by a certain naturall violence: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58581:34"/>
ought a more vicine, than a remote Consonance
rather to be set, that being what the Hearing desires.
But, on the contrary, when a perfect Consonance is
heard, we expect no imperfect one. Yet this Rule is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to frequent variation, nor can we now call to mind,
from what to what Consonances in particular, and by
what motions wee ought to pervene: all these depend
on experience, and the practice of Musicians; which
being known, we conceive it no difficulty to deduce the
reasons and proportions of all from this our Theory of
Musick: and I have formerly deduced many of them,
but my peregrinations have worn them out of both my
Papers and Memory.</p>
                     <p>5. That, in the end or close of each Tune, the eares
be so fully satisfied, as they expect no more, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Tune to be perfect: which is most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
effected by some Orders of Tones alwayes ending
in a most perfect Consonance, which Orders Musicians
call Cadences, all the Species of which Cadences have
been copiously enumerated by <hi>Zarlinus.</hi> Who hath Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Tables or Schemes also, wherein are described
what Consonances in particular ought to succeed each
other through a whole Tune; of all which hee hath
given some reasons, but we believe that more and more
plausible ones, may be deduced from our Fundaments.</p>
                     <p>6. And lastly, that the whole Tune together, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
voyce seperately be included within certain limits,
which are called Modes, of which anon.</p>
                     <p>All these Rules are to bee exactly observed in the
Counter-poynt of only two, or more voices; but not in
a Diminute, nor any way varied: for in Tunes very
Diminute, and (as they call them) Figurate, many of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58581:34"/>
them are remitted. Which that we briefly explicate,
wee are concerned first to treat of the foure Parts, or
Voices used in Tunes; for though in some are found
more, in some fewer Symphonies: yet that seems to
bee the most perfect and most usuall Symphony, which
is composed of four Voices.</p>
                     <p>The First and most Grave of all these Voices, is that
which Musicians call <hi>Bassus.</hi> This is the chiefe, and
ought principally to fill the ears, because all other Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
carry the chiefest respect to the <hi>Basse,</hi> the reason
whereof we have formerly declared. Now, this Voice
is wont to move on not onely by Degrees, but also <hi>per
Saltus;</hi> the reason is, because they were invented to ease
that trouble, which would arise from the inequality of
the Terms of one Consonance, if one should immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bee expressed upon the neck of another; since the
more Acute doth strike the eare much more forcibly
than the Grave. For this trouble is lesse in a <hi>Basse,</hi> than
in other parts; in respect that it is the most Grave, and
therefore requires lesse strength of the spirit or breath
to its effusion, than any other. Besides, since all other
Voices hold a respect to the <hi>Basse,</hi> as the principall; it
ought to strike the ears more sensibly, that it may bee
heard more distinctly: which is effected, when it moves
on <hi>per Saltus, i. e.</hi> by the Terms of lesser Consonances im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
rather than when it moves on by Degrees.</p>
                     <p>The Second, being the next to the <hi>Basse,</hi> they call
<hi>Tenor;</hi> this being also, in its kind, the chiefest, because
it containes the Subject of the whole Modulation, and is
comparatively the Nerve, which extended through the
body of the Tune, doth sustain and conjoyn all the rest
of its Members. And therefore it is wont, so much as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58581:35"/>
possible, to move on by Degrees; that so its parts may
be the more united, and the Notes of it may be the more
easily distinguished from the Notes of other Voices.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>Tenor</hi> is opposed the <hi>Contra-tenor;</hi> nor is it
used in Musick for any other reason but because, by
progressing to contrary motions it may occasion Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and so Delight. It is wont, as the <hi>Basse</hi> to move
on by leaps; but not for the same reasons: for this is
done only for convenience and variety; for it consists
betweene two voices, which move on by Degrees.
Practisers so compose their Tunes sometimes, that they
descend below a Tenor; but this is of small moment,
nor doth it seem at any time to adfer any novity, unlesse
in imitation, consequence, and the like artificiall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-poynts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Superius</hi> is the most Acute voice, and is opposed to
<hi>Bassu,</hi> so that by contrary motions they frequently occur
each to other. This voice ought chiefly to incede by
Degrees; because, since it is most Acute, the difference
of Terms in this would cause greater trouble and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
if those Terms, which it would successively emit,
were at too great distance each from other. And it is
wont to be moved the swiftest of all others in Diminute
Musick: as the <hi>Counter-Basse</hi> most slowly: the reasons
whereof are deduceable from our precedent discourse;
for a more remisse sound strikes the Ears more slowly,
and therefore the Hearing cannot endure so swift a
mutation therein, in respect it would not have leasure
to hear all the single Tones distinctly.</p>
                     <p>These things thus explained, we are not to omit, that
in these Tunes Dissonances are frequently used instead
of Consonances; which is effected two wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58581:35"/>
Diminution, or Syncope.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Diminution</hi> is when against one Note of one part,
are set 2. or 4. or more in another; in which this order
ought to be kept, that the First make a Consonance with
a Note of another part, but the Second, if it be only one
Degree distant from the former, may make a Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and also be, by a Tritone, or Fifth fals, distant
from another part, because then it seems there set only
by accident: and as a way, by which wee may come
from a First Note to a Third, with which that First
Note ought to make a Consonance, as also doth the
Note of the opposite part. But, if that Second Note
incede <hi>per Saltus, i. e.</hi> bee distant by the intervall of one
Consonance from the First; then ought it to make a
Consonance also with the opposite part: for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
reason ceaseth. But then a Third Note may make
a Dissonance if it be moved by Degrees; of which let
this be an Example.</p>
                     <p>Superius. Syncoaep.

                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:58581:36"/>
A <hi>Syncopa</hi> is, when the end of one Note in one voice
is heard at the same time with the beginning of one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Note of an adverss part; as may bee seene in the
Example set, where the last time of the Note <hi>B,</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
with the beginning of the Note <hi>C,</hi> which is
therefore brought in, because there is yet remaining
in the eares the reeordation of the Note <hi>A,</hi> with
which it made a Consonance; and so <hi>B</hi> bears it selfe
to <hi>C,</hi> only as a Relative voyce, in which the Dissonances
are carryed through: yea, the Variety of these doth
cause, that the Consonances, among which they are
set, are heard more distinctly, and also excite the more
constant attention. For, when the Dissonance <hi>B C</hi> is
heard, the expectation of the eare is encreased, and the
judgement of the sweetnesse of the Symphony some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
suspended, untill the Tune shall arrive at the
Note <hi>D,</hi> in which it more satisfies the Hearing; and
yet more perfectly in the Note <hi>E,</hi> with which, after the
end of the Note <hi>D,</hi> hath kept up the attention, the Note
<hi>F,</hi> instantly supervenient doth make an exquisite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonance,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="71"/> for it is an Eighth [71]. And, indeed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are these Consonances used in Cadences; because
what hath been the longer expected, doth the more
please when it comes: and therefore the sound, after a
Dissonance heard, doth better acquiesce in a most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Consonance, or Unison. But heere Degrees are to
be set betwixt Dissonances: for whatever is not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonance,
ought to be accounted a Dissonance.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, wee are to observe, that the Hearing is
more satisfied in the end by a Eighth, than by a Fifth,
and best of all by an Unison; not because a Fifth is not
gratefull to the eare, as to the reason of Consonance:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58581:36"/>
but because in the end we are to regard Quiet, which is
found greater in those sounds, betwixt which is lesse
difference, or none at all, as in a Unison. Now this
Quiet, or Cadence is delectable not only in the end: but
also in the midle the avoidance of this Cadence intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
no small delight; namely, when one part seems
willing to quiesce, and another proceeds on. And this
is a kinde of Figure in Musick, such as are Rhetoricall
<hi>Figures</hi> in Oration, of which sort are <hi>Consequence, Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp;c.</hi> which are effected, when either two parts suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively,
<hi>i. e.</hi> at divers times, sing wholly the same, or
a quite Contrary, which at last they are wont to doe.
And truely this, in certain parts of a Tune, doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
much advantage Musick; but as for those artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<hi>Counter-poynts,</hi> as they call them; in such Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
where that Artifice is observed perpetually from
the beginning to the end: we conceive, they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
not more to Musick, than <hi>Acrosticks,</hi> or retrograde
Verses to <hi>Poefie,</hi> which was invented to charm the mind
into respective passions, as well as Musick.</p>

                     <p>FRequent it is among Practitioners to treat of these
Modes, and what they are, all well know; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
would it be superfluous here to insist thereon:
wee shall observe only, that they have their originall
from hence, that an Eighth is not divided into equall
Degrees, for one while a Tone, another while a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58581:37"/>
is found therein: and besides, from a Fifth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that of all others is most acceptable to the eare,
and every Tune seemes to bee composed for the sake of
this alone: for an Eighth can be divided into Degrees,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="72"/> onely seven different wayes [72], every one of which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="73"/> may bee againe divided by a Fifth two wayes [73], ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="74"/> Two [74]; in one of which is found a Fifth false
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="75"/> in place of a Fifth [75], whence there ariseth onely
twelve Modes, of which foure are lesse elegant, for this
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="76"/> cause, that a Tritone is found in their Fifths [76], so as
they cannot, from a Fifth principall, and for whose sake
the whole Tune seems composed, ascend or descend by
Degrees, but of necessity there must occur a false Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Tritone, or a Fifth false.</p>
                     <p>In every Mode, are three principall Termes, from
which all Tunes ought to bee begun, and most chiefly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="77"/> concluded [77], as all Musicians know: and they are
called Modes as well from hence, that they restrain the
Tune, least the parts of it ramble beyond mediocrity to
excesse; as from hence chiefly, because they are apt to
containe various Tunes, which may diversly affect the
minde according to the variety of Modes; of which
many things have been sayd by Practisers, taught onely
by experience, the reasons of all which may be deduced
from our precedent discourse: for, certaine it is, that in
some many Ditones, or Thirds <hi>minors,</hi> and in places
more or lesse principall, are found, from which almost
all the variety of Musick doth arise, as hath beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
proved. Again, as much may be sayd of Degrees
themselves; for a Tone <hi>major</hi> is the First, and comes
nearest to Consonances, and is <hi>per se</hi> generated from the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="78"/> Division of a Ditone; but all others <hi>per Accidens</hi> [78],
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58581:37"/>
from which and the like, many things concerning the
nature of Moods might bee deduced, if a <hi>Compendium</hi>
would permit. And heere it should follow, that wee
should discourse of all the motions of the minde, which
may bee excited by Musick, and in a singular Treatise
shew, by what Degrees, Consonances, Times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> those
motions ought to bee excited: but I should bee uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to my purpose of writing an Epitome.</p>
                     <p>I now discover Land, hasten a shoare, and omit many
things for brevity, many by oblivion, but more by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
However, I suffer this issue of my braine, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and lately brought forth rude as a Bears Cub, to
venture abroad into your presence: that it may remain
as a Monument of our Familiarity, and a most certain
memoriall of my love of you: yet, if you please, upon
this condition, that, being confined to the secresie of
your Closet, it bee not exposed to the Judicature of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who may not (as I trust you will) avert their
benevolous eyes from the maimed, and defective parts
of this Exercise, upon those others, in which I deny not
but I have expressed some Lineaments of my Ingenie to
the life; nor would they know that this <hi>Compendium</hi>
was composed for your sake alone, by one who could
not obtain Privacy in an an Army, nor leasure in a Throng
of other Cares and Affairs.</p>

three <hi>Chords</hi> have an <hi>inequality</hi>

For as the Ration of <hi>d</hi> to <hi>e,</hi> is ⅔: (and ⅔ is a Fifth,
by Fig. first, p. 10.) so the difference of an Unison and a
Fifth is a Fifth. (1+4<hi rend="sup">x</hi> = 5.) and as <g ref="char:ration">ℛ</g> of <hi>e</hi> to <hi>f</hi> is ¾: (and
¾ is a Fourth by Fig. first, p. 10.) so the difference of a
Fifth and an Eighth is a Fourth. (5+3<hi rend="sup">x</hi> = 8.) And (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
Sounds, thus numbred, are as it were imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
(because not equally distant) audible Indices
or Logarithms of their Chords. Here the Reader may
observe that for the Difference of an <hi>Eighth,</hi> I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

only <hi>seven;</hi> of a <hi>Fifth, four;</hi> and of a <hi>Fourth, three:</hi>
