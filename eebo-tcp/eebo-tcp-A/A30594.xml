            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe was not ſo perfect in that

that which is <hi>mans,</hi> inſtead of that which is
<hi>Gods,</hi> God will make the Authours of ſuch

2. 8, 9. It is not unknowne how divine
providence proceeded againſt the <hi>Daniſh</hi>
Prelates; Had they denyed themſelves,
maintained the pure Worſhip of God,
ſought the publike good of Prince and
people, they might have ſtood to this day;
but becauſe they were ſhamefully wicked,
and ſought themſelves too much, they
<pb facs="tcp:101279:5"/>
were wholly caſt out by Prince and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Chryteus Chron. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xon.</note>
in the yeare 1537: <hi>Self-ſeeking</hi> is <hi>ſelf-undoing;
Abſolom</hi> and <hi>Adoniah,</hi> whileſt
they ſought themſelves, they loſt their
lives.</p>
            <p>The argument of this Book is <hi>ſelfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall,</hi>
a hard, yet a ſafe leſſon; it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then Chriſt taught and practiſed; <hi>If
any man will bee my Diſciple, let him deny
himſelfe and follow me, Matth.</hi> 16. 24. there's
the <hi>doctrine,</hi> ſee his <hi>practiſe, Ioh.</hi> 6. 15. when
they would make him a King, hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes;
the greatneſſe and glory that
was in royall Majeſty, could nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
with his ſpirit; <hi>Hee did not his owne
will, but the will of his Father.</hi> It liked not
him to have his workes blowne abroad;
his whole life &amp; death was an abſolute ſelf-denyall.
This way would he have all his
to goe, and it is a way wherein is no death.
Hee that doth moſt deny himſelfe, he lives
moſt free from ſinne. Take a true ſelfe-denying
man, and paſſion is a ſtranger to
him; he ſinnes not with anger, becauſe he
rejoyces in his wrongs; hee ſwells not
with pride, becauſe hee is content to bee
contemned; hee frets not at afflictions,
becauſe he deemes himſelfe worthy of all
puniſhments. <hi>Selfe-denyall</hi> breeds great
joy, and brings great eaſe. It unburthens
a man of himſelfe, his <hi>ſinfull ſelfe:</hi> What
<pb facs="tcp:101279:5"/>
               <hi>joy,</hi> what <hi>eaſe</hi> was it to <hi>Joſeph</hi> to bee rid of
his inticing <hi>Miſtreſſe?</hi> he let goe his coat,
and ſaved his innocencie. And let a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
rid himſelfe of his ſinfull <hi>ſelfe,</hi> and his
joy and eaſe will exceed <hi>Joſephs;</hi> if he let
goe his <hi>Fleſh,</hi> hee ſhall advance his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would it not be another Heaven to be
rid of our ſinfull <hi>opinions,</hi> ſinfull <hi>wills</hi> and
<hi>affections?</hi> deny thy ſelfe, and this Heaven
is thine. A ſelfe-ſeeker onely makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
miſerable; hee is an abſolute Tyrant,
his <hi>ſelfe-love</hi> turnes <hi>charity</hi> out of doores, &amp;
eates up all the <hi>love</hi> that <hi>God</hi> &amp; <hi>man</hi> ſhould
have; neither others good, nor Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
are deare to him, hee is a clod of the
earth that ſucks the ſap of his ſoule onely
to himſelfe. It is the ſelfe-denying man
that is the man for God and publike good.
Such a one was <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heaven and Earth
have beene honoured by him; ſuch a one
will venture even where danger &amp; difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is, <hi>ſelfe</hi> ſhall not hinder publike good.

            <p>It is the honour of a Chriſtian to be
like unto his Maſter Chriſt; hee denyed

be acted wholly by Chriſt. <hi>I live not,</hi> ſayes

and hee gained enough by it; there is no
better way then to denie our ſelves, and to
doe it fully. It is a fayling, and that a great

            <p>And fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> for <hi>honour in the world,</hi>
he was very eminent, the adopted ſon
of <hi>Pharaohs daughter;</hi> the name of this
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter,<note place="margin">Ioſeph. lib. 2, cap. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Ioſephus</hi> tells us, was
<hi>Thermuthis:</hi> he ſayes likewiſe ſhe was
the onely child <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had, <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
had no ſonne to inherite the kingdom,
and that this his daughter <hi>Thermuthis</hi>
had no child, and therefore having
found <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhee ſet her heart upon
him, and feined her ſelfe to bee with
child, and kept <hi>Moſes</hi> hid, untill ſuch a
time as it might be thought to bee her
owne child, to that end, that he might
inherite her fathers crowne.</p>
            <p>And further hee tells us, that this
daughter of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was much belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of her father, and that, in reſpect
to her, he loved <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in this relation that hee hath.
Hee ſaith that when <hi>Moſes</hi> was a little
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101279:11"/>
one, <hi>Pharaohs daughter</hi> brought him to
her father, &amp; put him into his armes, &amp;
he, to gratifie his daughter, tooke off
his owne diadem, and ſet it upon <hi>Moſes</hi>
head. There were likewiſe divers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtications
that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doe great things. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, that
<hi>Amram, Moſes</hi> his father, had a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
revelation concerning this childe,
that he ſhould be delivered from the
danger of being ſlaine, and that hee
ſhould bee a deliverer of his people.
He tells us likewiſe, that when <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
put his diadem upon his head, hee,
though but a little child, tooke it off,
and ſtampt it under his feete; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſome of his Magicians would
have had him put to death, ſaying
that it was a ſigne, that this child

            <p>And one <hi>Gualmyn</hi> a later writer,<note place="margin">Gualmyn de vita Moſis. p. 1. 2. 10. 11.</note> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the life of <hi>Moſes,</hi> hath this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
that when <hi>Moſes</hi> was three
yeares old, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> made a great feaſt,
and his <hi>Queene</hi> holding him by the
right hand, and his <hi>daughter</hi> together
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101279:12"/>
with <hi>Moſes</hi> by the left, his Nobles
being bid to ſit before him, <hi>Moſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them all tooke <hi>Pharaohs</hi> crowne
from his head, and ſet it upon his own,
whereupon all being amazed, one <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>
a Magitian, put <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in minde
of a dreame hee had had, which was
this: <hi>There ſtood before him an old man,
having a paire of ſcales in his hand, and
in one of the ſcales there appeared to him
as if all Aegypt, the children and women
had beene in it, in the other ſcale hee ſaw
onely one childe, which downe-weighed
the whole Kingdome, and all that was in
the other ſcale.</hi> This is <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe
<hi>faith,</hi> whoſe <hi>ſelfe-deniall</hi> is ſet downe
unto us thus glorious in this Scripture,
one who might have lived a moſt
brave life in the enjoyment of the
higheſt honours, the ſweteſt pleaſures,
the choiſeſt delights that heart could
wiſh, &amp; yet this <hi>Moſes refuſed to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the ſonne of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>daughter.</hi> This
<hi>Moſes chooſes rather to ſuffer afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with the people of God:</hi> this <hi>Moſes</hi> is
contented <hi>to bee ſcorned and contemned
for Chriſt,</hi> he ventures upon the wrath
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101279:12"/>
of the King and endures it all.</p>
            <p>In this excellent argument of the
ſelfe deniall of ſuch a worthy of the
Lord,<note place="margin">1.</note> we are to conſider: Firſt, what
he refuſes, namely, <hi>to bee accounted the
ſonne of Pharaohs daughter:</hi> for <hi>Moſes</hi>
was generally reputed to be her owne
ſonne, and honoured as her owne ſon,
but he thought it a greater honour, to
be a ſonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to come of the
promiſed ſeede, to have his pedigree
from Gods people, this hee accounts
more noble, and this hee will rather
glory in, though hee does prejudice
himſelfe in great p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eferments, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and riches, and all kind of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
glory that otherwiſe hee might
have enjoyed: from whence the point
is:</p>
            <p>That nobility of birth,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> and court ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and all outward delights are to bee
denied for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> wee are to conſider <hi>the
time</hi> when this was, it was when hee
was of <hi>full yeares:</hi> the words in the
originall are,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> when hee came to bee
<hi>great,</hi> and the obſervation from this is:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:101279:13"/>
That it is then truly honorable indeede,<note place="margin">Doct.</note>
to deny honours and pleaſures, when wee
have opportunitie to enjoy them to the
full, in the very prime of our time.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> wee are to conſider the
<hi>principle</hi> which carried him on, which
was <hi>faith;</hi> and from thence the point
is:</p>
            <p>That faith is the principle,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> that muſt
carry through, and make honorable all
a Chriſtians ſufferings. <hi>For the firſt.</hi>

                  <p>IT muſt bee granted, that nobility of

of those places, and of the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
where they live. Soule-nobility is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101279:14"/>
the chiefe, yet I will not ſay the ſole
nobility; naturall nobility muſt have
its due reſpect. It was a ſpeech of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab</hi>

law?</hi> but to bee borne of the Kings of
the earth is accounted more, this is the
higheſt nobility; that which is under it,
birth from other great men of the

                  <p>For firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> it is no ſuch thing, but that
the greateſt enemies of God, hated of
him, and caſt out for ever from him
have had it as well as others; what a
ſucceſſion of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Dukes</hi> came
from the loynes of <hi>Eſau?</hi> there reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
eight Kings in <hi>Edom,</hi> before there
was a King over the children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi>
yea before the government of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and they flouriſhed till the dayes of
<hi>Obadiah,</hi> no leſſe then twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares, yea they lived to ſee the
ruine of the ſecond Temple, as wee
finde it related by <hi>Joſephus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioſeph. de belle Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daico. lib. 7. cap. 22.</note> whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

that we finde, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2. 12. and ver. 22.
23. where the Lord would teach <hi>Iſrael</hi>
not to inſult upon their outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts:
hee gives this reaſon, becauſe
<hi>they were ſuch as hee had given to others
before them, who were wicked. In Seir,</hi>
ſaies the text, The <hi>Horims</hi> dwelt before
time, and the ſonnes of <hi>Eſau</hi> poſſeſſed
them, and deſtroyed them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and dwelt in their ſteade,
as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did unto the land of his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion:
<hi>[as Iſrael did] Iſrael</hi> had not <hi>yet</hi>
poſſeſſed, but this is ſpoke propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
as it was afterwards in the dayes
of <hi>Ioſhua;</hi> as if God ſhould ſay, This is a
favour indeede towards you, to make
you conquerours over your enemies,
to give their countries into your poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
this is an honour put upon you,
but it is no other favour, no higher
honour, then wicked prophane <hi>Eſau</hi>
hath had before you, therefore you
have no great cauſe to bee puffed up
with it. That which the Lord ſaith
here of conqueſt, is true of parentage,
of riches, of honour, of al outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101279:15"/>
they are indeede favours of
the Lord, but no ſuch excellent things,
but that they have beene made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the enemies of the Lord; and
therefore there is great reaſon that our
hearts ſhould not bee puffed up with
them, but ſit looſe from them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> there is no ſuch great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in it, becauſe the birth of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
is defiled with ſinne, in the guilt
and uncleanneſſe of it, as well as the
birth of the meaneſt: the moſt noble
blood upon earth is tainted with high
treaſon againſt the God of Heaven:
whatſoever your birth bee from men,
yet you are borne a child of wrath, an
enemy to God, loathſome and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
before him, an heyre of hell.
When God would humble the <hi>Iewes</hi>
who gloried much in their birth, hee
ſhewes them <hi>the uncleanneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus illis venio qui ante me fecerunt damnata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quam na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Bern. in Medit. cap. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of it, in that expreſsion, Ezek. 16.
your father is an Amorite, and your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ſaies <hi>Bernard,</hi> by whom I was a
damned creature before I was borne:
your birth is ſuch, what ever it bee in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101279:16"/>
regard of outward greatneſſe, as if
there bee not a ſecond birth, it had
beene better for you that you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
beene borne, or rather that you had
beene of the generation of Dragons, or
the off-ſpring of Vipers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe it were not defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.</note>
yet it is an exceeding poore and
meane thing in the eyes of God: it
may bee ſomething before men, but
before God it is nothing, for God is
no reſpecter of perſons: ſo much a
man is worth,<note place="margin">Tantus quiſque eſt, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Deum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> as hee is worth in Gods

of what houſe you came. That
which <hi>Pelicane</hi> a German Divine ſaid
concerning his learning,<note place="margin">Melchior Adam in vita ejus.</note> may bee ſaid
of all honour of birth. When I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before God, ſaies he, I ſhall not
appeare as a Doctor, but as an ordinary
chriſtian: ſo you ſhall not appeare as
noble men when you come before
God, but as other ordinary men. I
pray tell me,<note place="margin">Dic quaeſo quid ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus eſt? nihil aliud certe quam verbi ſonitus ab omni re deſtitutus quod in extremo illo die probe ſcietis. Chryſ. in Mat. 18. Hom. 59.</note> ſaies <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> what is

of a word, an emptie thing, which in

That is obſervable which wee have,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 15. when God requires a
price for the ranſome of the ſoules of
his people, all muſt give halfe a ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kell,
the rich ſhall not give more, and
the poore ſhall not give leſſe: when
they give an offering to the Lord, to
make an atonement for their ſoules,
God doth not value the rich more
then the poore, nor the noble more
then the man of meane birth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> it is not much in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
of men neither, who are wiſe,
and rationall: hence it is obſerved by
ſome, that wee never reade of any in

their birth dayes,<note place="margin">Nam ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus &amp; proavos et quae non ſecimus ipſi vix ea nostra vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co.</note> and they were <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,

they gather how little the glory that

from thoſe which were ſervants; there
is no ſervant but had ſome of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
Kings. <hi>Rehoboam</hi> was of a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh

the wiſeſt upon the earth. <hi>Nabal,</hi>

that was that idole Prieſt we reade of,
<hi>Jud.</hi> 18. 30. yet he was <hi>Moſes</hi> his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child,
<hi>Cerſhoms</hi> ſonne. Honour is but
a ſhaddow, and therefore it neede bee
of ſomething that is our owne; riches,
places of dignitie, titles of honour
put upon anceſtors by Princes are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
now the greateſt nobility, and
this deſcendes to the honour of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
but that nobility which theſe
things now put upon men, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Martyrdome was eſteemed to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101279:17"/>
doe: and therefore amongſt Chriſtians,
in the primitive times, children were
wont to glory in their parentage as
noble, if they had beene Martyrs:<note place="margin">Alius, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit, habeo Martyrem; Alij ſuae familie viros obijciunt: frigida ſunt iſta verba. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil nobis aliorum virtus prodeſſe valet. Ariſtippus.</note> but
yet <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his third ſermon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Lazarus</hi> labours to take off men from
glorying in this, becauſe it was not
their owne; he ſaies it is a frigid, empty,
vaine boaſting to boaſt of this, and
gives this reaſon; for the vertue of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
cannot perfect us. It is not from
whence a man comes, that is his true
glory, but what he is, and what good
he does. It was the expreſſion of a
<hi>heathen,</hi> that he regarded no more his
wicked children that came from him,
then hee would vermine that came
from his body: if we be wicked, wee
may be a diſgrace to our anceſtours,
they can be no honour to us. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus

his three ulcers and cankers, and was
wont to cry out, <hi>oh that I had lived

Although gold comes from
the earth none deſpiſeth it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101279:18"/>
though droſſe and ruſt comes from
the gold, none regards it; the vertuous
coming from meane parentage are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,
and the vitious coming from
noble parentage are contemptible.
This is the firſt argument, that there is
not much in nobility of birth, that it
ſhould be counted too great a thing to
be laid downe for God.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> ſuppoſe there be ſome
great matter in it, yet God is infinitely
worthy that it ſhould bee laid downe
for his honour: if there were ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times more honour in it then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
there is, yet the denying of all
were not a ſufficient teſtimony of that
reſpect you owe to the great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
God. God is worthy that all the
Kings, Princes, Potentates, great ones
of the earth, ſhould come and bow,
and lye downe flat before him, abaſed
in his preſence, that they ſhould all
bring their Crownes, and pompe, and
dignities, and caſt them downe at his
feete, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. 10, 11. the foure and
twenty Elders fell downe before him
who ſate upon the throne, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101279:18"/>
him that liveth for ever, and
caſt their crownes before the throne,
ſaying, <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
glory, and honour, and power, &amp;c.</hi>
Such infinite diſtance there is betwixt
the excellency and greatneſſe of the
Lord, and all the nobles of the world,
that it is a wonderfull favour of God
to them, that if he doe but appeare to
them, they may live before him; it is
their honour that their lives may bee
preſerved when God makes knowne
his glory,<note place="margin">3.</note> as <hi>Exod. 24. 10, 11. And
they ſaw the God of Iſrael, &amp;c. and upon
the nobles of the children of Iſrael hee
laid not his hand,</hi> that is, to deſtroy
them, but they were ſuffered to live in
his ſight.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as God is worthy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his infinite excellency, ſo it is
due to him; becauſe whatſoever excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
&amp; honour there is in the nobility
of your birth,<note n="*" place="margin">Longela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teque di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latata eſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra ſupra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terram, ſed audite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilium, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dete quod in vobis est hanc gloriam ad illum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre à quo eſt, ſi non vultis eam perde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, aut cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè perdi ab ea. Ber. Epist. 207.</note> it is he that hath made
the difference betweene men: the
rainebow is but a common vapour, it
is the ſunne that gilds it, that enamels
it with ſo many colours; wee are but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101279:19"/>
a vapour, it is the Lord that hath ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
upon us and our fathers houſe, and
hath put more beauty, more luſtre up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, then upon other vapours. I
may ſay in this reſpect, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith in another caſe; who makes thee
to differ? was not the lump of all
mankind in the hand of the Lord, as
the clay in the hand of the Potter, to
make one to this outward honour, and
another to meanneſſe &amp; baſeneſſe as he
pleaſeth: hee might have ſo ordered
things, as wee might have beene, not
onely of the moſt beggerly, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
broode, but might have beene
begotten a toade, or a ſerpent,
or any other the vileſt creature that
liveth upon the earth: that honour
wee have, God hath put upon us, and
therefore it is his, the glory of it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
due unto him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there is no ſuch way to
adde glory to your nobility, as to bee
willing to uſe it or deny it for God.
This proceedes from a noble principle
indeede, whereſoever it is. It is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101279:19"/>
that cauſes the one kinde of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
but it is the grace of God, a
ſparkle of the divine nature, a ray of
the very glory of God himſelfe, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into the ſoule, that is the cauſe of
the other.<note place="margin">Gratius ei fuit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men pieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis quam potestatis. Tertull. Apol. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ. gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. c. 34.</note>

eſteemed of him, then the name of

the more noble, in as much, as riches
and nobility being contemned, ſhe was
made the more noble in her poverty
and humility.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Chriſt was the glory of his
father, the luſtre of his glory, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101279:20"/>
&amp; engraven forme of his image,
the onely begotten Sonne of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from all eternity: hee thought
it no robbery to be equall with God,
he was God bleſſed for ever, and yet
how did he empty himſelfe? hee was
made a ſcorne, he was called the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters
ſonne, as one that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible:
hee made himſelfe of no
reputation, he came in the forme of a
ſervant, yea of an evill ſervant that
was to be beaten: yea hee was made
a curſe, as if he had beene the vileſt of
men: and yet this was the glory of
Chriſt himſelfe, becauſe it was all for
God, and good of ſoules: who is hee
then, that knowes any thing of Ieſus
Chriſt, that ſhall thinke much to lay
downe all the honour of nobility of
birth, or any outward dignitie under
heaven for him? It is a notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
that <hi>Bernard</hi> in a ſermon upon

<hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, his Lady was the

of the principall Peeres of <hi>Italy:</hi> yet
being brought to heare a Sermon of

reſorted to him, to take him off

of ſome truthes that he underſtood

himſelfe from that idolatry that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
himſelfe defiled with;
therefore his reſolutions were ſtrong
to leave court, and father, and honours,
and inheritance, to joyne himſelfe to a

this his reſolution he went away: much

him with dolefull cryes, his friends
ſtanding by with watery eyes, which

for him, admoniſhing him ſecretly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

holy mother the Church: unto whom
he made this anſwer; Moſt worthy
Prince, I am alwaies prompt, and
ready to obey, for as much as I know
you an appointed miniſter of God;
unto you (next my eternall God) I
owe my whole obedience, and ſubmit

the ſonne of perdition, the open ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary

ſtanding in the holy place.</p>
               <p>This was in the darkeneſſe of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,

The blood-thirſty Papiſts never left
till they got his blood, prevailing with
the King to conſent to his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and when the ſentence of his
condemnation was read, the ſtory
ſaith, that this worthy noble man
with a chearefull countenance ſpake
after this manner: Though yee judge
my body, which is but a wretched
thing, yet am I certaine and ſure, that
you can doe no harme to my ſoule, no

               <p>God forbid that any of you ſhould
have a thought that the ſervice of God
ſhould be a diſgrace unto you, that it
ſhould be too low a thing for you, that
it ſhould bee counted a diſparagement
to you to ſtoope unto it, that it ſhould

oh no, it is ſinne onely that ſpots and

being aſhamed of Ieſus Chriſt in any

you, then you can bee to it. It is the
unhappineſſe of many who are of
birth and quality, they loſe much

in communion with Gods ſervants in
their gifts and graces, becauſe of that

wanting, inſtructing ſervants, leaving
unneceſſary occaſions and ſports, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon the preaching of the word,
calling over what of Gods minde hath
beene made knowne to them. The
Holy Ghoſt ſets it out as an addition
to the honour of thoſe noble men of
<hi>Berea, Acts</hi> 17. 11. that they received
the word with all readineſſe of minde,
and ſearched the Scriptures after they
had heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach, to examin what
had beene delivered to them: After
<hi>Oſwald,</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> was
converted by one <hi>Aidan</hi> a Biſhop,<note place="margin">Beda. Hiſt. lib. 3. Cap. 3. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> it is
reported of him, that he diſdained not
to preach and expound to his ſubjects
and nobles in the Engliſh tongue, that
which <hi>Aidan</hi> preached to the <hi>Saxons</hi> in
the Scottiſh tongue.</p>
               <p>It ſtill remaines the glory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
of that young truly noble Lord
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101279:32"/>
                  <hi>Harrington</hi> in the bleſſed memory of
him, that he was ſo diligent &amp; ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in thoſe duties of religion which
now are accounted ſo meane and low
by many great ones. It is recorded in
his life, that he prayed not onely twice
a day in ſecret, but twice with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
likewiſe in his chamber, beſides
the joyning at the appointed times of
prayer in the family: he meditated of
three or foure ſermons that hee had
lately heard every day; every Lords
day morning hee would repeate
the ſermons that hee had heard the
Lords day before, and at night thoſe
he heard that day. There is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
betweene ſuch exerciſes as
thoſe, and the dignity of nobility, if
things be judged according to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
judgement: there is in truth no
denial of the honour of true nobleneſſe
in theſe, but becauſe of the perverſe
judgement of the world, there is neede
of much ſelfe-deniall to ſubmit to
them.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of this point is this:
if you would be indeede honorable, as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101279:32"/>
your famous and religious anceſtors
have beene, be as they were. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſayes to us, as God to <hi>Eli, 1 Sam. 2.

I have read of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> that
for the ſtirring up of the ſpirits of
yong men to noble and heroicall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes,
they uſed to have the Statues

that is, in vertue and famous actions,
<hi>eritis ſicut illi,</hi> you ſhall bee like them
in glory and renowne. Thus the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the ſucceeding generations
after worthy anceſtors hath lifted
them up in their due honour and their
deſerved high eſteeme, with this Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
upon them, <hi>ſi fueritis ſicut hi, eritis

for the honour of religion, and

               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:101279:33"/>
Honour likewiſe, and all pleaſures
and delights that we enjoy, are to bee
denyed for Chriſt. It is true, they are
the bleſſings of God in themſelves:
many of Gods ſervants have enjoyed
them, and made much uſe of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them for
God and his people; as <hi>Joſeph, Eſter,
Mordecai, Obadiah, Ezra, Nehemiah,
Daniel,</hi> the Lord deputy of <hi>Cyprus,
Acts</hi> 13. 2. the great <hi>Lord Treaſurer of
the Queene of the Ethiopians, Acts</hi> 8.
27. So it is ſaid, that he had the charge
of all her treaſure; and thoſe that
were of <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſhold, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 22.
And ſo in after times. Church Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
relate unto us many worthyes of
the Lord who lived in the Courts of
the greateſt perſecuters of Chriſtian
religion, and yet they kept their faith
intire, and their conſciences unſpotted.
As <hi>Flavianus</hi> in <hi>Veſpaſianus</hi> his Court,
<hi>Dorotheus</hi> in <hi>Diocleſians, Terentius</hi> in
<hi>Valentinians,</hi> and multitude of others
might be named in all ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.
Court-honours are to bee
denied for Chriſt, for they are his,
it is hee that hath raiſed us in theſe,
higher then others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:101279:33"/>
And though they be bleſſings, yet
not ſo great, that wee ſhould grudge
Ieſus Chriſt the having the honour of
them; the leaſt of his honour hath
more excellency in it, then all theſe in
the heigth of them, and ten thouſand
times more then theſe: for there is a
vanity in them all: we know <hi>Solomon,</hi>
who had the higheſt of them that ever
were, yet hee ſaw, and had the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of <hi>vanity,</hi> yea <hi>exceeding vanity,</hi>
and <hi>vexation of ſpirit</hi> to be in them: ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

vaine only, but vanity it ſelf. Secondly
<hi>exceſſive vanity,</hi> for it is <hi>vanity of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
Thirdly a <hi>heape of vanities,</hi> for it is
in the plural number, <hi>vanitie of vanities.</hi>
Fourthly, <hi>all is vanity.</hi> Fifthly, hee

in theſe neither; which appeares
by the comparing of two places of
ſcripture. In the ſixth chap. of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
of <hi>Amos,</hi> &amp; the fourth verſe, he
charges the Courtiers of riotouſneſſe;
for it appeares, that though before he
was a heards-man, yet now he is a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
to the Court, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 13. that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otouſneſſe
which he charges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
he expreſſes thus; <hi>That lie upon beds
of ivorie, &amp; ſtretch themſelves upon their
couches, and eate the lambs out of the flocke,
and calves out of the midſt of the ſtall:</hi>
They would have the beſt of every
thing whatſoever it coſt them; calves
in the midſt of the ſtall were the
beſt. <hi>They chanted to the ſound of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ole,
and invented to themſelves inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of muſicke like David;</hi> that is,
moſt curious and exquiſite inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101279:36"/>
not like <hi>Davids</hi> inſtruments to
praiſe the Lord by, but as <hi>David</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the beſt inſtruments hee could
to ſerve God by; ſo they invented
the beſt that could bee got, and laid
out much charge for them, that they
might more fully ſerve their luſts by
them. <hi>They drinke wine in bowles, and
annoynt themſelves with the chiefe
ointments,</hi> and theſe they give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto, ſo as they minde nothing
elſe; they care not what becomes of
any thing, ſo be it they may freely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the pleaſures of their luſts: <hi>They
are not grieved for the affliction of Ioſeph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This their life might ſeeme to ſome
a moſt brave and deſireable life, but
marke what the Holy Ghoſt ſaies of it
in the ſame chapter, verſe thirteene,
<hi>Ye which rejoyce in a thing of nought,</hi> all
theſe pleaſures put together were in a
true judgement but a thing of nought;
<hi>Res nihili,</hi> they had nothing in them;
when wee feede upon thoſe, <hi>wee
doe but feede upon aſhes, and a ſeduced
heart hath deceived us, Iſay 44. 20. that
wee cannot ſay, is there not a lye in our
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101279:36"/>
right hand?</hi> they doe moſt certainely
put a lye into our right hand, that is,
they make us to uſe our chiefeſt
ſtrength for that which is nothing elſe
but a meere lie, and yet they doe ſo
enſnare us, and ſo groſſely ſeduce us,
<hi>that wee cannot ſay, is there not a lye in
my right hand?</hi> wee cannot ſo much
as queſtion with our ſelves: Are theſe
the things that wee were borne for?
are theſe the chiefe good of thoſe that
are raiſed to ſuch an high eſtate? are
there not other things that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of us to looke after? we cannot
thus ſay in our owne thoughts, <hi>Is there
not a lye in our right hand?</hi> ſuch is the
evill &amp; unreaſonableneſſe of our way,
that if we did but ſay thus in our own
heart, we would ſoone bee aſhamed of
it, confounded in it, and our hearts
would quickly turne away from it.</p>
               <p>But by the favours of the court,<note place="margin">Riches to be denyed for Chriſt.</note> a
man may raiſe his eſtate ſo, as to make
him, and his, that follow after, great;
there is ſome reality in <hi>riches,</hi> is there
not? No, not in <hi>riches</hi> neither, for ſo
ſayes <hi>Solomon, Prov. 23. 5. wilt thou ſet
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101279:37"/>
thine eyes upon that which is not: for
riches certainely make themſelves wings,
they flie away as an Eagle.</hi> Obſerve firſt,
the Holy Ghoſt ſaies that riches <hi>are
not,</hi> are <hi>nothing:</hi> thoſe things that make
men great in the eye of the world, are
<hi>nothing</hi> in the eyes of God: a cipher
is nothing in its ſelfe, yet put a figure
to it, and it is ſomething. Secondly
obſerve, the Holy Ghoſt would not
have us ſo much as <hi>ſet our eyes upon ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
they are not objects worth the
looking on. Thirdly obſerve, with
what indignation hee ſpeakes againſt
thoſe that will ſet their eyes upon
them; <hi>wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that
which is not?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, what
a vaine, unreaſonable, ſottiſh, ſenſeleſſe
thing is it? Fourthly obſerve, that he
ſayes their parting from us is by way
of <hi>flight,</hi> that is, a ſudden, a ſwift, and
irrecoverable motion. Fifthly, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that this flight is by <hi>the wings of
an Eagle,</hi> which is the moſt ſudden, the
moſt ſwift, and irrecoverable motion.
Sixtly obſerve, none neede put wings
upon them to fly away, for ſo ſayes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101279:37"/>
the text, <hi>they make to themſelves wings,</hi>
there is matter enough in themſelves
to worke their owne corruption, and
to put themſelves into a flight.</p>
               <p>Wee thinke when wee are called to
denie ſuch riches, pleaſures, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
that then we are called to deny
ſome great thing; but the truth is, had
wee an eye to diſcerne the vanity of
them, we ſhould ſee that we are called
to deny nothing but a meere fancy, a
thing of nought, and that which <hi>is not.</hi>
Oh that the glory of the world were
darkened in our eyes, as one day it ſhall
be, that it might not bee ſo deare unto
us, as to thinke it ſuch a great matter
to part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> with any thing in it, in the
cauſe of Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Riches</hi> are too
meane things for a truely noble ſpirit
to be taken withall: if generouſneſſe
of ſpirit cannot raiſe above money,
where is the glory of it. <hi>Luther</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
that the ſin of covetouſneſſe, hee
ſaw ſo baſe and vile, and his ſpirit was
ſo above it, that hee was not ſo much
as tempted with it.</p>
               <p>That which is obſerved of <hi>Joſhua,</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:101279:38"/>
makes him a glorious example to all
great men. He was the divider of the
land to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; left none to himſelfe,
&amp; that portion that was given him, and
he contented with all, was but a meane
one in the barren mountaines. This <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
notes in his Epiſtle upon <hi>Paula,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mirata eſt quod di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributor poſſeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſibi montana &amp; aſpera delegaſſet.</note>
he ſaies ſhe viſited the Sepulchre of
<hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and marvelled very much, that
the divider of the poſſeſſions had the
hilly and craggy places for himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And yet further know, as there is a
vanity and emptineſſe of good, ſo there
is a mixture of much evill; they are as
water in the bottome of pits exceeding
muddy; the water is not much, but the
mud cauſes it to be unuſefull. If things
be ſo mixt with trouble and cumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that the evill of them will not
anſwer the good expected in them, we
reject them as things unprofitable.
You will deny your ſelves many times
in forty, in a hundred things, to get
your minde in ſome one, and it may be
when you have it, it is not worth the

you get <hi>honours, pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>riches,</hi>
but conſider whether all be not muddy

in the getting, and in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them, what feares and ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
what undermining one another?
what diſappointments? what vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
what a clutter of buſineſſe croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
one the other? what ſnares and
temptations lye in your way at every
hand? you walke all the day long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſnares, as <hi>Iob.</hi> 18. 8. upon dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſnares that bring much ſinne and
guilt, and will bring much ſorrow
&amp; miſery: how little doe you enjoy
your ſelves for the preſent, nor any
thing you have to your ſelves?</p>
               <p>Hence ſome give the reaſon, why
<hi>Ioſeph,</hi> although he had power to have
advanced his brethren in the Court,
yet hee would not have them live
there, but by themſelves in <hi>Goſhen,
tending their ſheepe;</hi> he had an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
call to be there, but hee knew
the encombrance and ſnares of it, that
he ſought it not for his brethren. If
a thing that is cold, have ſome heate
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101279:39"/>
added to it, and then as much cold as
that heate was, the thing is not hotter
then it was before; ſo you, though
you may have much honour, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and riches added to your eſtate,
though the world who looke upon
theſe think you happie, yet you your
ſelves knowing that there is as much
evill likewiſe added to your condition,
as the good of thoſe come unto, your
condition is not at all more happie
then it was before.</p>
               <p>Againe further, conſider the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
that is in all; indeede the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
that nature affords are chiefly to
be had with you; but even nature it
ſelfe is but a wheele, all at uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:<note place="margin">

as <hi>James 3. 6. The tongue is ſaid to
ſet the whole courſe of nature on fire:</hi> the
word in the originall is the <hi>wheele of
nature.</hi> You know the ſtory of <hi>Seſoſtris</hi>
King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who would have his
chariot drawne with foure Kings, and
one of them had his eyes continually
upon the wheele; whereupon <hi>Seſoſtris</hi>
asked him what he meant by it? hee
anſwered, that it put him in minde of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101279:39"/>
the mutability of all earthly things;
for I ſee, ſaith hee, <hi>that</hi> part of the
wheele which is now up on high, is
preſently downe beneath, and <hi>that</hi> part
which is now below, is preſently up on
high: whereupon <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
conſidering what mutability
might be in his owne eſtate, he would
never have his Chariot drawne after
that manner any more. The relation
of this ſtorie, was a meanes to bring
downe the ſtoutneſſe and pride of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great Prince: For when <hi>Mauriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
ſent <hi>Theodorus</hi> his Phyſitian embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour
to <hi>Chaianus</hi> Prince of the
<hi>Hunnes,</hi> who perceiving the ſtoutneſſe
and arrogancy of the Prince, related
unto him the ſtory of the King of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;
Chaianus</hi> being moved by it, his
ſpirit yeelded, and he was content to
come to conditions of peace with the
Emperour <hi>Mauritius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All men in worldly honours are
like an houreglaſſe, now this end is
uppermoſt, by and by this is downe,
and the other is up, and this part of it is
full, and by and by it is empty, and the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101279:40"/>
other that was before empty is full,
what is become of all the great ones
of the earth that lived and ruled in the
earth but a while agoe? their glorie is
buried in the duſt, <hi>Pſ. 76. 12. The Lord
cuts off the ſpirit of Princes:</hi> the word
is, <hi>he ſlips off,</hi> as one ſhould ſlip off a
flower betweene ones fingers, or as
one ſhould ſlippe off a bunch of grapes
from a vine, ſo ſoone is it done. How
great uncertainety have many great
ones, by their miſerable experience,
found in their outward glory, and
worldly felicity? what a change hath
a little time made in all their honours,
riches, and delights?</p>
               <p>That victorious Emperour <hi>Henry
the fourth,</hi> who had fought two and
fifty pitched battells, fell to that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
before he dyed, as hee was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to petition to bee a <hi>Prebend</hi> in the
Church of <hi>Spier,</hi> to maintaine him in

<hi>King Gillimer,</hi> who was a potent King
of the <hi>Vandalls,</hi> who was ſo low
brought, as to intreate his friend to
ſend him a ſpunge, a loafe of bread,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101279:40"/>
and a harpe; a ſpunge to dry up his
teares, a loafe of bread to maintaine
his life, and a harpe to ſolace himſelfe
in his miſery. <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports

the onely man living in his time,
having his eyes put out,<note place="margin">Date obo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurio.</note> was led at laſt
in a ſtring, crying, <hi>give a halfepeny to

               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the uncertainties, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilities
of all worldly honours:
mighty Potentates of the world have
beene <hi>ludibria fortunae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ludibria fortunae.</note> the very ſcorne
of fortune: all the choiſe things that
the world affords, are as water in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ciſternes, not having any ſpring to
feede them, &amp; the ciſterne being broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
will let out all; they are but as a thing
without a foundation, which cannot
ſtand long. That is obſervable that we
find in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi>
chap. 11. <hi>v.</hi> 10. It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
that <hi>he ſought a citie that had a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
noting thereby, that all other ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101279:41"/>
though never ſo glorious, and by
conſequence all other worldly things,
have <hi>no foundation</hi> to uphold them.
Hence <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
nobility of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Arcadia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plut. de quaeſt.</note> were
accuſtomed to weare moones upon
their ſhooes,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 76.</note> that they might have
alwaies the mutability of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
before their eyes. That which
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies of riches, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17.
is true of all worldly things; <hi>Truſt not
in uncertaine riches:</hi> ſo it may bee ſaid,
truſt not in uncertaine honours, nor in
uncertaine pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Hence it was that <hi>Solon,</hi> when hee
ſaw <hi>Croeſus</hi> puft up with his great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and outward glory, thinking
himſelfe the happieſt man that lived,
hee ſaid unto him, <hi>none was to bee
counted happie before death:</hi> intending
hereby to admoniſh him of the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of thoſe riches, in which hee
bleſt himſelfe ſo much, and would
have him conſider, that before the end
of his daies there might bee a great
change in his condition: but he while
hee enjoyed his outward proſperity,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101279:41"/>
minded not at all what <hi>Solon</hi> had ſaid
unto him, untill he came by his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
experience to finde the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of his riches, and all that
worldly glory that hee had, and
then hee could remember <hi>Solons</hi>
ſpeech unto him; for when hee
was taken by King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be burnt, and ſaw the fire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for him, then hee cryed out, <hi>O
Solon, Solon: Cyrus</hi> asking him the
cauſe of that outcry, hee anſwered;
that now hee remembred what <hi>Solon</hi>
had told him in his proſperity, <hi>that
none was to bee accounted happie before
death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus wee have many, who heare
much of the uncertainty, and vanity
of their outward honours, ſenſuall
pleaſures, greate eſtates and riches
they have in the world, but while they
enjoy the ſweet of them, they little
minde what is ſaid, till they come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their ſicke beds, and death beds,
and then they cry out moſt lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
of the vanity of all worldly
things, then they can remember what
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101279:42"/>
hath beene ſaid unto them heretofore,
concerning the vanity and ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of all thoſe things they tooke
ſo much delight in.</p>
               <p>All things then wiſely and duely
conſidered, theſe honours, pleaſures,
and riches are not ſuch great things,
that we ſhould be ſo hardly brought
to deny our ſelves in them: a wiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
heart would quickly caſt
dirt in the face of them all, a true noble
great ſpirit would trample them as
dirt under feete,<note place="margin">Non mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis eſt magnos petere ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores, ſed contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere. Aug. de civit. Dei<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib. 5.</note> when once they come
in competition with Ieſus Chriſt. It
is an excellent ſpeech of Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine;</hi>
It is not an argument of a great
minde, to ſeeke for great honours, but
rather to contemne them: and indeede
(conſidering all, at leaſt in the cauſe of
religion) they are to bee accounted as
contemptible and vile things. They
are like a candle, which while it is light
it hath ſome luſtre, and hath no ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
but when it is out it ſtinkes: ſo
all outward excellencies, while they
are as it were enlightned with grace
added to them, and a holy uſe of them,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101279:42"/>
they have ſome luſtre, and are deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but take this away, howſoever
they may appeare to a carnall eye, yet
they are indeede but as a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
ſnuffe, unſavory themſelves, and
making thoſe who have them unſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the noſtrils of God.</p>
               <p>And conſider yet further, what Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt hath denied for us, if ever
we be ſaved by him. Hee came from
the boſome of his Father, and from
<hi>that infinite glory he had with him, before
the world was;</hi> for ſo he prayes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.
that the Father would glorifie him
with that glory he had with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world was: Hee left the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and pleaſures of heaven, and that
honour which hee might have had
from Angels and men, and all to ſave
poore, wretched, ſinfull creatures.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, God hath greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
for us, then all theſe things
here below can afford, if we have hearts
to denie theſe for him: we neede take
no care for <hi>dignities, delights,</hi> and <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
or whatſoever may make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
and glorious; there are infinite
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101279:43"/>
treaſures of all with the Lord, and hee
delights in the communication of
them to the children of men. <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
accounted the honour that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
put upon men as great a glory as
that which came by places of dignity,
as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaies of <hi>Socrates;</hi>

learning to put honour enough

not Chriſtians thinke that godlineſſe
and the honour which that brings, is
ſufficient to make them glorious?
Surely wee know not that neareneſſe
that godlineſſe hath to God himſelfe,
that infinite glorious firſt being, from
whom the luſtre of all true glorie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes;
ſurely wee know not, how

for it, for feare of the loſſe of their own

know that the venturing for a
publike good, is a greater honour then
the enjoyment of any private. <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius</hi>
in his Hiſtoricall Meditations,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101279:44"/>
hath a famous ſtory of the chiefe Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,

whom when they ſaw to intend to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
unjuſt Edicts, they underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

anſwers, We are come with a full
purpoſe to loſe our lives every one of
us, rather then by our connivencie any
unjuſt ordinance ſhould take place:
The King being amazed at this anſwer,
and at the conſtancie and reſolution of
theſe Peeres, gave them gracious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
and commanded that all
the former Edicts ſhould be cancelled
in his preſence.</p>
               <p>There is a notable relation that wee

that upon a time he invited <hi>Caius</hi> the

<hi>Staupitius,</hi> wherein hee profeſſeth, that

then be accuſed of wicked ſilence in

while the Lord and his cauſe doe
ſuffer. And know, that the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured,
and trampled upon, any cauſe
of God is, the more he expects that you
ſhould appeare for it. I have read, that
among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the left hand is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

moſt ſubject to danger, hee would have
thoſe who were moſt honourable, to
ſtand by him there where he was moſt

               <p>Thus where the cauſe of God is
moſt oppoſed, and moſt like to ſuffer,
there God would have the moſt noble
ſpirits to ſtand, and to appeare in that;
and to doe this is truely honourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.

               <p>In the Annalls wee reade in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie

daily keepes off many, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of great ones would bring on
not onely multitudes of other people,
but other great ones alſo,</p>
               <p>It is reported of <hi>Lucius</hi> King of
<hi>England,</hi> who was the firſt King that
ever by his authority eſtabliſhed
Chriſtian religion in his Kingdome;<note place="margin">Sabellicus in his Hiſt.</note>
which is the honour of our countrey,
it was the firſt Kingdome that ever
had Chriſtian Religion eſtabliſhed by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101279:52"/>
the ſupreme magiſtrate. In the firſt
entrance into the Kingdome, he favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
Chriſtian Religion, as an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
hiſtorian, <hi>Gildas Albanius</hi> reports:
but yet the Religion hee was brought
up in ſtucke ſo faſt in him, that hee
could not bee brought off wholly to
embrace Chriſtian Religion. And a
great thing that hindered him, was the
offence he tooke at the outward mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and povertie of Chriſtians; and
eſpecially hee looked at the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
who were a glorious and victorious
people, and the <hi>Emperour</hi> there, who
lived in ſo great glorie and proſperitie;
and hee conſidered with himſelfe, that
they did not embrace Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and wherefore then ſhould hee:
But after hee learned from the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that ſome of the
noble and chiefe of <hi>Rome,</hi> as by name
<hi>Trebellius</hi> and <hi>Pertinax,</hi> and others,
embraced the Religion of Chriſtians;
that the Emperour himſelfe was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with that miraculous Raine, that
was cauſed by the prayers of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
then <hi>Lucius</hi> attended more fully
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101279:52"/>
to underſtand what Chriſtian Religion
was, and was taken off from that which
formerly hindered him. Whereupon
he ſent to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> then Biſhop of
<hi>Rome, Elvanus</hi> and <hi>Medinus</hi> his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours,
to ſend him ſome to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the <hi>Brittaines</hi> in the Doctrine of
Chriſt, that hee might eſtabliſh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion in his Kingdome, and
aboliſh Heatheniſme; this was in the
yeere of Chriſt 179. Thus you ſee
what a power Religion hath, when it
is in great ones.</p>
               <p>And on the contrarie, the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

follow after it; that way that they ſee
to be a way of preferment, and to get
the countenance of thoſe that are <hi>great
men,</hi> generally they will chuſe; yea
how doe wee ſee many, that they may
bee like great ones in their way, and
get a little petty preferment by them,
they will ſubject themſelves to moſt
ſordid things, that otherwiſe common
humanity would loath and abhorre.
There is a notable example for this in

by being like them in any baſe wayes.

above others, which have beene abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,

               <p>I have read of one <hi>Franciſus Xave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
who writing to <hi>John</hi> the third,
King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> gave this wholſome
counſell to him, that every day, for a
quarter of an houre, he would meditate
of that divine ſentence, <hi>What ſhall it
profit a man to win the whole world, and
to loſe his owne ſoule?</hi> and that he would
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101279:55"/>
ſeeke of God the right underſtanding
of this, that hee might be ſenſible of
it, and that he would make it the cloſe
of all his prayers, the repetition of
thoſe words, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man,
&amp;c.</hi> How happy counſell would this
be for all our <hi>Courtiers</hi> and <hi>great men,</hi> if
it might be followed? when you have
ſpent all your eſtates, and improved
your power onely upon ſinfull wayes,
to ſatisfie the luſts of your owne
hearts, when theſe ſhall be taken from
you, or you from them, with what
confidence can you looke up to God
for mercy? doth it not come from low
thoughts of God, and want of the feare
of his great and dreadfull Name, for
you to thinke to ſpend ſuch great ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
upon your luſts, which hee hath
betruſted you withall for his honour,
and yet to thinke that you can eaſily
do well enough in this matter between

looke up to God with much comfort,
and to have expected with confidence
much mercy from him.</p>
               <p>It is reported of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of

being to be laid into priſon by his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
his friends petitioned for him to
the King; the King anſwered, if hee
had ſpent ſo much money in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of his Prince, or for the good of
his Countrey, in relieving his kindred,
I would have hearkned; but ſeeing hee
hath ſpent ſo much upon his body, it
is fit his body ſhould ſmart for it: So
when you come and looke up to God
for mercy in your diſtreſſe, when the
comforts of the creature ſhall be gone,
God may juſtly anſwer; if you had ſpent
that abundance of the creature that I
afforded to you in my ſervice, for the
good of my people, I would have
heard you, but now it is juſt you ſhould
be left in your diſtreſſe, and that ſo

Text, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 26. Not many rich, not

is ſtraightned in a more narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe,
and God ſaith of <hi>ſuch a ſort of

it to ſtrike feare: as if a company in a

ſtrike feare into all; but when thoſe

But being in the agonie of death,
and conſidering more thorowly of his

for you, who have ſo much of the

conſidering the corruption that is in the
hearts of the children of men: it is a
hard thing, and ſeldome hath ſucceſſe,
to give rules for the ordering of life, to
men who are in great proſperitie in this

                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:101279:57"/>
who being deſired by the <hi>Cyrenians,</hi>

a very hard thing, to make Lawes to
bind men who were in great proſperity.

               <p>There are ſome who have beene in

               <p>Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> compares men of

in which caſe his goodly ornaments
doe but ſerve with more deſpight to

the more to upbraid, and caſt in his

be nothing could put more ſcorne and

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <head type="sub">It is a ſpeciall argument of ſincerity,
that when the profeſsion of Religion proves
costly to us, yet we continue in it.</head>
               <p>FIrſt this argues great ſincerity:
now the <hi>truth of grace appeares</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to be religious, when religion
muſt coſt us ſomething; this is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of truth of grace: to be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
when by religion we may get the
comforts of the world, this is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of ſincerity. Hence Iewiſh
writers tell us, that in <hi>Solomons</hi> time,
when the Iewes proſpered in all
worldly felicity, then they were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
how they entertained Proſelytes,
becauſe many would be comming then
upon worldly reſpects to joyne with
them: but to profeſſe religion when
it requires the loſſe of all outward
comforts, and that at thoſe times, when
the ſweetneſſe of them is moſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
this is ſome thing like: to profeſſe
the truth while we may live upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, this
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101279:63"/>
argues no truth; but to profeſſe it
when it muſt live upon us, upon our
honours, upon our profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and earthly contentments, this
is a ſtrong argument of truth: as to
ſee the beauty of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
through all outward diſreſpects,
this is ſomething: for to ſee the evill
of ſinne through all outward glory,
reſpect and contentment in this world,
when it may bee enjoyed to the full,
this is much; ſurely here is truth, here
is a piercing eye that is inlightned and
quickned by the ſpirit of God. It was
a true ſigne that thoſe nobles of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
wee reade of in the 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 33. were
of <hi>Iehues</hi> ſide, when they caſt downe
<hi>Jezabel</hi> who had painted her face; ſo
when the world comes with her pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
face, in her pompe and glory, yet
when God ſaies <hi>who is on my ſide?</hi> then
to throw downe this painted <hi>Jezabel</hi>
to the ground to the doggs, to licke up
her blood; here is a true argument
that we are on Gods ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> ſhewed his true thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
when hee would not offer unto
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101279:64"/>
God <hi>that</hi> which coſt him <hi>nothing,</hi> but
would have the teſtimony of his
thankefulneſſe coſtly to him: ſo when
the profeſſion of religion proves coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to us, and yet we continue in it, this
is a good argument of truth. In times
of affliction every hypocrite; all tag
and ragge will be ready to come in to
God in an outward profeſſion; but
uſually this ſubmiſſion to God at this
time is not out of truth. Hence that
place in the 66. <hi>Pſalme 3. v.</hi> where it
is ſaid, <hi>through the greatneſſe of thy
power ſhall thy enemies ſubmit</hi> unto thee:
in the originall it is <hi>they ſhall lye unto
thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mentien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and ſo it is tranſlated by <hi>Arian
Montanus,</hi> and ſome others, noting
hereby, that a forced ſubmiſſion to
God is ſeldome in truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it argues the excellency
of grace, that it raiſes and greatens
mens ſpirits, it lifts them up above the
higheſt of all theſe things, and ſo high
above them, as the things of the world
when at the higheſt are looded on us
under things, and appeared ſmall and
contemptible in the eyes of ſuch a rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101279:64"/>
ſoule: many poore ſpirited men
are below them, and looke up to them
as great matters, and thinke, oh how
happie ſhould they bee, if they could
attaine to them, they bleſſe them who
have got up to them, but grace is of an
elevating nature, and it manifeſts it
ſelfe to bee from on high, even from
heaven, from the God of heaven, who
is infinitely above the heavens, and it
raiſeth the ſoule to God himſelfe, ſo
that not onely the things of the earth,
but even heaven it ſelfe would appeare
but a poore low meane thing, beneath
the dignity of a ſoule, made partaker
of the divine nature, were it not that
the glorious preſence of God were
there.</p>
               <p>As it argues the exceeding greatnes
of the heavens, that all the earth is but
as a point to them, all the huge great
mountaines, and vaſt circumference
of the earth is as nothing in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of them: ſo when all the honours,
delights, and riches of the earth, which
are eſteemed ſuch huge and mighty
things by the men of the world, yet to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101279:65"/>
a gracious ſpirit, though enjoyed to
the full, are accounted as nothing, this
argues a glorious worke of grace, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
the heart of a man. God brings
it himſelfe as an argument of his owne
greatneſſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> chap. 40. that <hi>all the
Nations of the earth are as a drop of a
Bucket, and as a duſt of the hallance to him.</hi>
So when all the braveries and delights
of the world are to a ſoule but as a little
<hi>duſt,</hi> looked at as having but a drop of
comfort in them, farre from affording
any good draught of comfort to quench
the thirſt of it; no, it muſt have the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
of all comfort to drinke on, even
God himſelfe, no leſſe then an infinite
ocean of bleſſedneſſe will ſerve the
turne, for it to be ſatisfied withall, and
this argues a ſpirit great indeed; and
the truth is, let men think what they
will, yet it is moſt certaine, there are no
men in the world of great ſpirits, but
onely godly men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> it argues the <hi>power</hi> of grace;
to reſiſt powerfull temptations is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
grace. It was powerfull grace
that enabled <hi>Joſeph</hi> to reſiſt ſuch a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101279:65"/>
temptation as hee had from his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe.<note place="margin">Virtus eſt placidis abſtinuiſſe bonis.</note>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> ſayes, it was no leſſe
miracle to overcome the flame of luſt
in this temptation,<note place="margin">In tali oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſione, &amp; copia pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi non fuit minus miraculum vincere flammas libidinis, quam quod tres viri ex camino ignes ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>columes evaſerunt.</note> then it was for
thoſe three men to be kept ſafe in the
firy furnace. When the World prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it ſelfe in the glory and beauty of
it unto us, the temptation is ſtrong to
fleſh and bloud: Hence wee have ſo
many Caveats in Scripture, that <hi>when
we are full,</hi> wee ſhould beware, <hi>that wee
forget not God,</hi> and take heed wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
not from him; then, <hi>then</hi> is the
danger, when corruption hath matter
to feed on, yet <hi>then</hi> to keepe it downe
argues ſtrength.<note place="margin">Luth. in cap. 51.</note> It is not the worke of
a childe, to governe a horſe pampered,
full fed in fat paſtures. It was an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that <hi>David</hi> had much power over
his affections, that though the <hi>waters of
Bethleem</hi> were ſo longed for of him,
ſo deſirable to him, yet when hee had
it before him, and might have drunke
of it, yet then hee could deny himſelfe,
and refuſed. When <hi>Eſau</hi> looked on
the pottage of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſaw it was ſo
red, ſo ſutable and pleaſing to him, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101279:66"/>
hee muſt needes have it, though it coſt
him his birth-right, hee was not able to
deny himſelfe in giving contentment
to his fleſh, at that one time, though he
knew it muſt coſt him dear; but though
all the delights of the World be proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yet where there is powerfull grace,
they are rejected.</p>
               <p>It is a ſtrong ſtomacke that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
much fat, much honey, and ſweet
things, that uſually clog weake ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes;
ſo it is a ſtrong ſpirit that is
not overcome with the ſweet of much
proſperity. It argued, there was much
power in the <hi>oath</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> cauſed his
Army to take, 1 <hi>Sam. 14. 26. Not to eate
any thing that day,</hi> when though they
being faint for want of meate, and yet
comming through a Wood, where ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
dropped from the leaves before
them as they went, yet none dared to
touch one drop: So here, when men
are compaſſed about with all delights,
and they are fleſh and bloud as well as
others, and they finde the temptation
come ſtrongly upon them, yet through
the aſſiſtance of the grace of God they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101279:66"/>
can abſtaine; this is a great honour to
grace, and arguing much power in
it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> it is a teſtimony of deare
love to the Lord, to deny ones ſelfe for
his ſake, when one is in the higheſt of
enjoyment of all delights to the fleſh;
it is an argument, that God is indeed
the proper place, the centre of the ſoul,
when although it hath never ſo much
of the creature, to give ſatisfaction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, yet it cannot reſt, but workes ſtill
to God through all, and from all: As
a ſtone, though it were in never ſo good
a place, although it were in Heaven,
yet it would deſire to deſcend, becauſe
the proper place of it is below; ſo let a
gracious heart which hath God for the
centre be put into any condition never
ſo full of delight, yet it is not ſatisfied,
it is willing to leave all, that it may
cloſe with God: To ſeeke after God,
and make much of godlineſſe in the
times of affliction may argue ſelfe
love, but love to God appeares not
<hi>then.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As God manifeſts his love to us in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101279:67"/>
not ſparing his owne Sonne for us, ſo
wee manifeſt our love to God in not
ſparing our deareſt contentments for
him. This God teſtifies of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
hereby hee knew he loved him <hi>indeed,</hi>
in that for his ſake, <hi>hee did not ſpare his
onely ſonne Iſaac;</hi> As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. when
<hi>the Kings daughter</hi> is content to forſake
<hi>her fathers houſe and deareſt kindred,</hi>
then the King delights in her beauty:
to pretend love to Chriſt when the
World withdrawes from us whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is lovely in it, this is not much, but
now to have our love burning after Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, when the World proffers
to us all her lovelineſſe, this is true
love. Love is bountifull, it is ſhewne
to purpoſe, when it ſhewes it ſelfe able
and willing to part with much for the
beloved; as that love of God ſhould
be for ever accounted deare and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that ſhewes mercy to one at that
time when hee is moſt wicked, in the
height of ſinne, even tempting God to
deſtroy him; ſo if when you have the
ſtrongeſt temptations to draw your
hearts from God, yet even then you can
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101279:67"/>
finde your hearts ſweetly working to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, cloſing with him, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in him, here is love unfained, this
is love that God will owne and make
much of for ever. As the Idolatrous
<hi>Jewes</hi> ſhewed their love to their Idols,
by plucking off their <hi>eare rings,</hi> and
parting with their <hi>Jewels,</hi> and moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
things they had, for the honour
of their <hi>Idols:</hi> ſo doe the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
of God ſhew their love to
him, when they doe part with much
that is pretious and delightfull to fleſh
and bloud.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> this gives God the glory of
all our proſperity, which ſhewes wee
acknowledge it to be from him, and for
him, and that wee have it not for our
ſelves, but for the ſetting forth his
praiſe: When God gives us much of
the creature, wee miſtake his meaning,
if we thinke hee gives it us to enjoy as
we pleaſe, for hee gives all to uſe for
himſelfe, and where this is much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
there God is much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified;
if wee miſtake not Gods mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
yet at leaſt we forget upon what
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101279:68"/>
tearmes wee receive all our comforts
from God,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

them againe to him; they are the
words of a Heathen, <hi>thou forgetteſt that
thou haſt received thoſe things</hi> (ſpeaking
of worldly proſperity) <hi>to returne them
againe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, this gives teſtimony to the
world, that ſurely there are wonderfull
bleſſed things, that God acquaints the
ſoule withall in the wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that there is much ſweet and
contentment to be had in thoſe wayes;
they ſee ſomething more glorious that
makes them ſo little to regard the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that there is in the things of the
World, when men might have all
content in what the World affords, and
yet they are willing to deny all for
Chriſt, ſurely they finde much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in Jeſus Chriſt, that takes up their
hearts, and ſatisfies their ſoules, or elſe
they would never doe as they doe; they
have found ſomething better then all
theſe things, ſomething that the world
knowes not of, that makes them doe as
they doe; they would not let goe their
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101279:68"/>
hold in theſe outward things, were it
not they had found ſomething bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>If you ſee a Bee leave a faire flower
and ſticke upon another, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that ſhe findes moſt Honey dew
in that flower ſhee moſt ſtickes upon:
So here Gods people would never leave
ſo many faire flowers in the Worlds
Garden, had they not ſome other in
which they finde moſt ſweetneſſe;
Chriſt hath his Garden, into which he
brings his beloved, and there ſhe findes
other manner of flowers then any the
World hath, in which there is ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of a higher nature, even the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
dew of the choiſe mercy, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and bleſſing of God himſelfe:
if Gods people doe leave the full breſts
of the World, it is becauſe they have
found the breſts of conſolation, from
which they have ſuckt other manner of
ſweetneſſe then the breſts of the world
can afford; were it not for ſome who
have had much in the World, and yet
have denyed themſelves for Chriſt, this
teſtimony to the wayes of godlineſſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101279:69"/>
could not have beene given; but bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be God, wee have ſome who doe
give this teſtimony, in which God is
much honoured, and which is their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7.</note> thus to deny ones ſelfe
is honourable,<note place="margin">Nulla in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicitas frangit, quem nulla foelicit as corrumpit. Aug. in ſenten.</note> becauſe whereſoever
this is, there ſurely will be a holding
out to the end; no troubles of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
can ever make ſuch a one to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
any wayes of God, who can dny
himſelfe for God in the midſt of the
pleaſures of proſperity.<note place="margin">Nemo frangitur adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia, qui proſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione non capitur. Aug. Ser. in Monte l. 2.</note> A man that is
able to deny himſelfe in proſperity,
will be able to beleeve in adverſity; if
he bee <hi>proſperity</hi> proofe, there is no
feare but hee will be <hi>adverſity</hi> proofe
too.</p>
               <p>If you read thorow the whole Book
of God, you ſhall finde that the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of proſperity have beene the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
ſnare, few of Gods ſervants have
paſſed through that condition without
diſhonour, but the eſtate of adverſity
hath ever proved moſt ſafe; ſeldome
any of Gods ſervants but have beene
bettered by it. Wee read of Manna,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101279:69"/>
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 21. that it was melted with
the Sunne, but it could endure the heat
of fire, for they baked Cakes of it:
Thus it is with many men, they are
melted, many good things in them
vaniſh and come to nothing by the
heat of proſperity, whom the fire of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
cannot hurt, but is uſefull to
them.</p>
               <p>If a man hath overcome the delights
of the World, he hath overcome the
great hindrance in the wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
the great danger of Apoſtaſie,
that which cauſes ſo many thouſands
to fall, and to forſake God and his
bleſſed wayes: ſuch a ſoule hath got
over the great ſtumbling blocke, at
which ſo many ſtumble, and fall, and
breake themſelves by, <hi>Ezek. 3. 20. I
will lay a ſtumbling block,</hi> ſaith the Lord.

                  <hi>I

on them flatteringly: but where have
wee any example of any, who have
denyed themſelves in proſperity,
that ever failed in the times of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</p>
               <p>Eightly this upbraides thoſe who
doe greedily embrace the things of
the world,<note place="margin">8.</note> and thinke that it is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible
for any to deny themſelves in ſo
great delights as they doe enjoy: as
<hi>Balaak</hi> wonders, that upon offers of
ſuch great preferments, as hee offered
unto <hi>Balaam,</hi> he came not to him, hee
thought it impoſſible, that there ſhould
bee any man in the world that would
not bee moved with ſuch an argument
as that was. So baſe covetous wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and ambitious men, that love
their honours, and thoſe that follow
after their fleſhly pleaſures, they think
all the world are of their minde, if
they had the like opportunityes they
would doe as they doe. <hi>Nero</hi> who
was ſo baſely uncleane, thought that
all men in the world were ſo too, or
would be ſo, had they fit opportunities
for their uncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:101279:70"/>
Men heare ſpeaking of ſelfe-deniall,
but they doe not beleeve there is any
ſuch thing in reality, they would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee the man that can deny himſelfe
in ſuch things as they injoy, if he may
have them as freely, and as fully as
they have: now this practiſe of Gods
people convinces them, that there are
ſome, that can doe thoſe things that
they thinke to bee impoſſible: God
hath his ſervants who have done ſuch
things, who can and will doe them,
and that willingly and joyfully too,
with much freedome and cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſpirit, and bleſſe God that
they have any comfort in the world,
any preferment or eſtate to looſe for
God, accounting it a happier thing to
looſe for God, then to enjoy for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

               <p>Firſt, this is a moſt evident argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that all the good things they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101279:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have in the world, comes from the
ſpirituall favour and love of God to
them, and this is no ſmall matter; there
is more ſweetneſſe in this knowledge
of the principle from whence the
good things we have doe come, then
in any thing that they afford of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
The difference of <hi>Iacobs</hi> bleſſing
from <hi>Eſau's</hi> is obſervable, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 28.
there is <hi>Iacobs, God give thee the dew of

               <p>A carnall heart cares not, ſo he may

God: wicked men, the objects of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101279:72"/>
Gods hatred may have them as well
as the godly, but outward bleſſings
with a heart to give God the glory of
them, doe alwaies come from Gods
love in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>God does oftentimes give the ſame
thing to one out of ſpeciall favour in
Chriſt, to another out of a generall
bounty, that God hath raiſed you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
others, this is a mercy; but that
he hath <hi>given you</hi> this grace, in this he
hath raiſed you indeed, this mercy is
of an higher nature, the other things
are called the goods of fortune, but
this is the fruit of Gods eternall love
in Ieſus Chriſt, this is a mercy peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to the choſen of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> this is an evident ſigne
that God intends to uſe you in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſervices, for the honour of his
name: as <hi>Saul</hi> collected from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>David,</hi> when he ſaw how he was
able to deny himſelfe in not taking
that advantage he had of him, when he
might have had his will upon him to
the full: <hi>bleſſed bee thou my ſonne Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
ſayes, <hi>Saul,</hi> thou <hi>ſhalt both doe great
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101279:72"/>
things, and ſhalt alſo ſtill prevaile, 1 Sam.</hi>
26. 25. So when a man may have his
will to the full, and yet can deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
it is a ſigne that God intends to
uſe ſelfe-denying ſpirits in his ſervice,
none to them; and this ſelfe-deniall is
of the higheſt kind.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> this is the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of all outward mercies that
may bee: this changes poore meane
things into moſt excellent glorious
things; it is impoſſible to make ſo
much advantage of any thing in the
world any other way as in this way:
here is a ſpirituall divine improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of naturall, of vaine droſſie
things, here is a turning of ſtubble and
dirt into gold and pearles, for great,
and precious, and glorious are the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that God uſes to recompence this
ſelfe-deniall withall.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> this ſelfe-deniall is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acceptable to God, God glories in
ſuch; <hi>Daniel</hi> kept cloſe to God, and
denyed himſelfe much in his great
proſperity, and hee is called <hi>a man
greatly beloved, Cap. 10. 11. vir deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum:</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:101279:73"/>
a man of deſires, ſo the words
are, as when a man is compaſſed with
temptation to deſpaire, a little breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of faith is acceptable: ſo when
hee is compaſſed with temptation of
ſatisfying the fleſh, of ſecurity, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
then a little, much more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
ſelfe-deniall, oh how accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
is it!</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> if you in the fulneſſe of all
your earthly contentments ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
Ieſus Chriſt, and bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to lay downe all for him, when he
ſhall come in the fulneſſe of his glory
hee will acknowledge you, and will
put glory upon you, when hee ſhall
come with his mighty Angels, full of
majeſtie, to be admired of his Saints;
then he ſhall owne you, and make you
partakers of his owne glory, hee will
then remember every cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
given for his names ſake, much
more then the giving him the praiſe
and honour of ſo much in the things
of the world as you have enjoyed. The
being made partaker of the fulneſſe of
Chriſts honour in that day will then a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101279:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thouſand times recompence the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
of your ſelves of any fulneſſe of
outward contentments in the creature
you have had here.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6.</note> if ever you ſhould live to
come to come to any adverſity in this
world, ſurely it will bee much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to you, if you bee willing to give
God the honour of the ſweet of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity:
though adverſity may come,
yet God will keepe the bitterneſſe of
it from you: if you ſo know God in
proſperity, as to deny the comforts of
it for him, hee will ſo know you in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
as to take off the gall and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe
of it from you: in all your ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of God in the time of trouble, you
may have a holy boldneſſe, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of ſpirit, having aſſurance that it is
not out of ſelfe-love that you ſeeke
him, that it is not out of conſtraint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
driven to him by afflictions; but
it is out of love to that God to whom
your ſoule flowes, as to a God in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you have an eſpeciall intereſt, that
God who was ſo deare to you in the
midſt of the enjoyment of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101279:74"/>
of the creature; ſo that now in
the want of all things, you ſhall bee
freed from thoſe checkes of ſpirit that
others have, damping their hearts
when they are about ſeeking after the
Lord in the time of their trouble.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7.</note> it is ſo much the more
honorable,<note place="margin">Perpauci ſunt qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingit &amp; faelices eſſe &amp; ſapere. Sen. ep. 94.</note> and may bee ſo much the

the ſixt chapter and the fifteenth verſe,

for the feare of the Lambe.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
their principle was, <hi>Moſes</hi> his

The time of <hi>Habakuk</hi> his prophecy,
was a time of much trouble to the
Church of God, and then that which
upheld the ſpirits of godly men, and
enabled them to ſuffer hard things, it
was their faith, chap. 2. 4. <hi>The juſt by
faith ſhall live,</hi> when other mens ſpirits
ſhall faile, and ſinke, and dye in them,
then <hi>they</hi> ſhall live, <hi>faith</hi> making <hi>juſt,</hi>
ſhall uphold them. Faith in this caſe
is like corke, that is upon the nett,
though the leade on the one ſide ſinkes
it downe, yet the corke on the other
keepes it up in the water. <hi>David</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
in the 27 <hi>Pſalme v. 13. that hee
had fainted unleſse he had beleeved.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
keepes from fainting in the
times of trouble. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> in the ſecond Epiſtle and
the firſt chapter, verſe. 24. that <hi>by
faith they ſtood:</hi> it is <hi>faith</hi> that makes
a man ſtand in the greateſt trialls. And
therefore when Chriſt ſaw how <hi>Peter</hi>
ſhould bee tempted, hee tells him that
he had prayed, <hi>that his faith ſhould not
faile:</hi> noting that while his <hi>faith</hi>
held, all would bee ſure; when hee
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101279:84"/>
began to ſinck in the waters, as he was
comming to Chriſt, it was becauſe his
<hi>faith</hi> began to faile him: So when our
hearts beginne to ſinke in afflictions, it
is becauſe our faith begins to faile us.
We reade, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. that Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhorted the diſciples at
<hi>Iconium</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> to continue in the
<hi>faith;</hi> and preſently they adde, that
<hi>wee muſt through much tribulation enter
into the kingdome of God:</hi> noting what
uſe they ſhould have of their <hi>faith,</hi> to
carry them through all. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaies of himſelfe, together with the
reſt of beleevers, in the firſt epiſtle of
<hi>Tim. 4. 10. Therefore wee labour and
ſuffer reproach, becauſe wee truſt in the
living God.</hi> Truſting in the living God,
is that which will carry a man through
ſervice, and ſuffering, whatſoever it
bee.</p>
                  <p>But wherein lies the power of <hi>faith</hi>
to take off the heart from the world,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
and carry it through ſufferings?</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> It is the primary worke of this
grace, wherein the very beeing of it
conſiſts: for the ſoule to caſt it ſelfe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:101279:84"/>
upon God in Chriſt, for all the good
and happineſſe it ever expects; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
here for all, to roule it ſelfe upon
God, as an al-ſufficient good, to make
an abſolute reſignation of all unto
him, ſo as to betruſt him with all, and
to commit all unto him for ever. Now
this implies the taking off the heart
from the things of the world, for
<hi>faith</hi> takes off the heart from its ſelfe,
therefore much more from any
thing in the world; and where this
is, ſufferings cannot be very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
becauſe the whole good of the
ſoule is now in God, <hi>Pſal. 37. 7. Reſt
in the Lord, and waite patiently;</hi> where
the ſoule pitches upon God, as the <hi>reſt,</hi>
and the al-ſufficient good of it, it will
<hi>waite patiently,</hi> whatſoever hard thing
befalles it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> by <hi>faith</hi> the ſoule comes
to have a higher principle to enable it
to ſee God in his glory and majeſty,
his greatneſſe, and infiniteneſſe, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
his juſtice, and goodneſſe, then
ever it had before. It is true that by
the uſe of <hi>reaſon</hi> we may come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101279:85"/>
much of God, but certainely
<hi>faith</hi> preſents God to the ſoule after
another manner then ever it formerly
ſaw him, or then any other man can
ſee him; untill <hi>faith</hi> comes into the
ſoule, it may well ſay it never knew
God, but now it ſees him infinitely
glorious and high above all; It ſees
the infinite fountaine of all good, and
what an infinite dreadfull thing it were
to be ſeparated from this God, or to
have the wrath of ſuch an infinite Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
to bee provoked againſt his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
We know by <hi>reaſon,</hi> that the
world was made by God: but Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the third verſe of this
chapter, that by <hi>faith</hi> wee underſtand,
<hi>that the world was made:</hi> ſo that the
ſame thing may be knowne by <hi>reaſon,</hi>
and by <hi>faith</hi> too, but <hi>faith</hi> being a
higher principle, diſcovers it to the
ſoule in a higher way then <hi>reaſon</hi>
can.</p>
                  <p>It is made one of the ſpeciall fruits
of <hi>Moſes</hi> faith, that enabled him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
in all his ſufferings, in the 27. <hi>v.</hi>
of this chapter, <hi>that he ſaw him who was
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101279:85"/>
viſible</hi> (of which hereafter) onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
for the preſent, that God is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to any eye, but to the eye of <hi>Faith;</hi>
now where God is ſeene ſo, as <hi>Faith</hi>
preſents him to the ſoule, t is impoſſible
but the feare of ſuch a Deity muſt
needes take mighty impreſſion in that
ſoule; and all the glory of the world
muſt needes be darkned to it; and the
leaſt diſpleaſure of the great God more
troubled at, then all the miſeries that
all creatures under Heaven are able to
bring upon it. How eaſie is it for a man
to deſpiſe the World, when <hi>faith</hi> gives
him a cleare ſight of God? <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40. 5,
6. The Text ſaith, <hi>The glory of the Lord
ſhall be revealed;</hi> and then the voyce
ſaid, <hi>Cry, all fleſh is graſſe, and all the
goodlineſſe thereof is as the flower of the
field;</hi> and verſ. 7. the latter end, <hi>Surely
the people is graſſe.</hi> When the glory of
God appeares, then all fleſh, and all
worldly glory, is but as graſſe, as the

thing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>faith</hi> diſcovers the <hi>reality</hi>
of the beauty and excellencie of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101279:86"/>
ſupernaturall, and eternall
things revealed in the Word, which
before were looked upon as notions,
conceits, and imaginary things. In the

be <hi>the evidence of things not ſeene:</hi> the

in the Originall; it is that which gives
a <hi>ſubſtantiall being</hi> to the things of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life: now when <hi>faith</hi> comes in,
the glorious myſteries of the Goſpel,
the high priviledges of the godly, the
excellencie and beauty of grace, the
great things that God hath prepared
for his ſervants are manifeſtly diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>It is a notable expreſſion of <hi>Jerome,</hi>
God would have ſuch ſtability of <hi>faith</hi>
in us,<note place="margin">Hieronym. ep. ad vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem in exilium miſſam. Tom. 9.</note> that the things which <hi>we beleeve</hi>
ſhould be more certaine to us, then the
things <hi>wee ſuffer;</hi> and the things <hi>hoped
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101279:86"/>
for,</hi> ſhould be in more reality with us
then things <hi>ſenſible to us:</hi> theſe things
are now apprehended as reall and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
things, although they bee ſuch
things,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9, 10.</note> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eye hath
not ſeene, nor eare heard, neither have
they entered into the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
yet God hath revealed them to
us by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> even that Spirit <hi>that
ſearcheth the deepe things of God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Spiritus ſanctus non eſt ſcepticus nec dubia, aut opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, ſed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertiones ipſa vita, &amp; omni experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia certio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res &amp; fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miores. Luth. T. 3.</note> now
there muſt be ſomething in us to take
this revelation of the ſpirit, and that
is <hi>faith.</hi> The Spirit reveales them not
as notions, not as uncertain things, and
ſo <hi>faith</hi> takes them. The Spirit of God,
ſayes <hi>Luther,</hi> does not write opinions,
but aſſertions in our hearts, more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
then life it ſelfe, and all experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whatſoever. <hi>Faith</hi> can ſee into
thoſe things, that no naturall eye ever
ſaw, it can apprehend that which never
entred into the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. ſayes,
that the things that are eternall, <hi>are
things not ſeene;</hi> and yet ſayes, that <hi>wee
looke at things that are not ſeene;</hi> though
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101279:87"/>
they be things that are not ſeene, yet
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and other beleevers, by the
eye of faith could ſee them, as certaine
and reall things. The things of Chriſt,
of grace, of Heaven, what poore emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
notions were they to the ſoule?
what uncertaine things before <hi>faith</hi>
came in? but <hi>faith</hi> makes them to bee
glorious things; <hi>faith</hi> diſcovers ſuch
reall certaine excellencie in them, and
is ſo ſure, that it is not deceived, that it
will venture ſoule and body, the loſſe
of all, that it will beare any hardſhip,
yea it will venture the infinite loſſe of
eternity upon them; <hi>faith</hi> diſcovers
ſuch reality and certainty in theſe
things, that now the things of the
World, that were before onely reall,
ſure excellencies in the eyes of a man,
<hi>now</hi> are as fancies, and ſhadowes, emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
imaginary contentments, that have
no being, no foundation, no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in them (as formerly hath beene

                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>faith</hi> gives the ſoule an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in God, in Chriſt, in all thoſe
glorious things in the Goſpel, and in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101279:87"/>
the things of eternall life. <hi>Faith</hi> is an
appropriating, an applying, and uniting
grace. It is a bleſſed thing to have the
ſight of God, there is much power in
it, but to ſee God in his glory, as <hi>my
God,</hi> to ſee all the Majeſty, greatneſſe,
and goodneſſe of God, as thoſe things
that <hi>my ſoule</hi> hath an intereſt <hi>in,</hi> to ſee
how the eternall Counſels of God
wrought for <hi>mee</hi> to make <hi>mee</hi> happy, to
ſee Chriſt in whom all fulneſſe dwels,
in whom the treaſures of all Gods
riches are, and all thoſe are <hi>mine;</hi> to
ſee Chriſt comming from the Father
<hi>for mee,</hi> to be <hi>my Redeemer,</hi> all this is
the worke of <hi>faith</hi> by the union of it
with God in Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Faith</hi> unites
the ſoule to Chriſt, after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
then any other grace.</p>
                  <p>Love cauſeth a morall and ſpirituall
union, but this cauſeth a myſticall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
other graces cauſe us to be like
to Chriſt, but <hi>this</hi> makes us be one with
Chriſt, and ſo have intereſt in what
Chriſt hath intereſt in. What is all the
world now to ſuch a ſoule? where is
all the bravery of it, or the malice and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101279:88"/>
oppoſition of it? The loſſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, or the enduring of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
are great evills to thoſe who
have not intereſt in better; but to ſuch
as have intereſt in higher things, there
is no great matter, though they loſe
lower.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>faith</hi> diſcharges the ſoule of
the guilt of ſinne,<note place="margin">5.</note> and that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
evill that followes upon it; It gets
a generall acquittance from God, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of all ſinne, and remiſſion of all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
thereof, ſealed in the blood of
his Sonne: The ſoule being made juſt
by <hi>faith,</hi> is able to live in the middeſt
of many troubles. <hi>The juſt by faith ſhall
live,</hi> ſo it is to be read, not <hi>the juſt ſhall
live by faith,</hi> but being made juſt <hi>by
faith,</hi> ſo as to ſtand <hi>juſt</hi> and righteous
in the Court of Heaven, it now is able
<hi>to live:</hi> Faith cleares all betweene
God and the ſoule; it may bee there
was long humiliation before, many
prayers made in ſeeking of this, many
teares ſhed, many duties performed;
yet all this could not doe, but the guilt
lay on ſtill; but as ſoon as <hi>faith</hi> comes,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:101279:88"/>
then all is gone, and the ſoule ſtands
righteous in the preſence of God, and
all the breach betweene God and it is
made up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Being juſtified by faith, wee have peace
with God</hi> (ſayes Saint <hi>Paul) Rom.</hi> 5. 1.
Now the breach being made up, and
peace made, marke what followes a
little after in that Scripture; there is
not onely ability to beare trouble, but
<hi>to rejoyce in tribulations,</hi> yea not onely
to rejoyce, but <hi>to glory in tribulations.
Strike Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Feri Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, feri, nam à pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutus ſum.</note> 
                     <hi>ſtrike</hi> (ſayes <hi>Luther) for I
am abſolved from my ſinnes.</hi> Now the
ſoule hath got a greater good then the
world can afford, and is freed from
greater evils then the world can inflict.
A man that hath beene with the King,
and gotten his pardon for his life, is not
troubled though hee loſe his glove or
handkerchiefe as hee comes out, nor
though it ſhould prove a rainy day as
he returnes home: truely the loſſe of
all things in the world to ſuch a ſoule, if
it hath faith acting, is but as the one,
and the enduring of all evils is but as
the other.</p>

And beſides, by this the ſoule ſees
it ſelfe ſo infinitely engaged to God,
as it is willing to doe or ſuffer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
God will have it: How rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
doth <hi>Iſaiah</hi> offer himſelfe to God

annexed, after God had taken away
his ſinne? When God asked <hi>whom

<hi>Here am I Lord, ſend mee:</hi> It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <head type="sub">Sixe more particulars wherein the
power of faith is ſeene, in taking the
heart off from the world, and carrying
it through all afflictions.</head>
               <p>FIrſt <hi>Faith</hi> makes the future good
of ſpirituall and eternall things, to
be as preſent to the ſoule,<note place="margin">1.</note> &amp; to worke
upon the ſoule as if they were preſent;
and makes uſe likewiſe of things paſt,
as if they were preſent; and in theſe
operations of <hi>faith,</hi> there is much
power to carry on the ſoule with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
through ſufferings; for preſent
things are apprehended by the minde
more fully, &amp; work more ſtrongly upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the will and affections, then things paſt
or to come: if I view a thing afarre
off, it appeares ſmall to mee, and little
of what the thing is, is conceived by
me: but if it be brought neere to me,
I ſee it to the full bigneſſe, and am bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to judge of the nature of the
thing as it is.</p>
               <p>And againe, it workes more <hi>ſtrongly</hi>
upon my heart: if I ſee a toade a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101279:90"/>
great way off, my heart ſtirrs not; but
if I ſee it neere, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaw the
<hi>froggs crawling upon his bed,</hi> then my
heart riſes with loathing of it. If wee
could but ſee things now, as God hath
told us they ſhall appeare to us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
how mightily would they worke
upon the ſoule, howſoever there are
many things that ſhall be ſeene here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
that yet were never revealed, and
thoſe things <hi>faith</hi> cannot make as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
but ſuch things as God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in his word, that they ſhall
hereafter come to paſſe, <hi>faith</hi> may, and
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is active doth make them as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the ſoule, &amp; workes them upon
the heart, as if they did now appeare.</p>
               <p>The want of this worke of <hi>faith</hi> is
the cauſe almoſt of all the evill in
the world: and the acting of <hi>faith</hi>
in this her worke, in the lively and
conſtant worke of it, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
fruites even to admiration. The
reaſon why thoſe <hi>threates</hi> of God did
not worke upon the people, to whom
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> preached,<note place="margin">Ezek. 12. 27. 28.</note> God himſelfe gives
in the 12. chap. <hi>Sonne of man, they ſay
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:101279:90"/>
thou propheſieſt of things a farre off.</hi> And
ſo for the <hi>mercies</hi> of God, and the
things of eternall life, becauſe the
choyce of them are things to come,
the world with her preſent delights
prevailes againſt them. If you could
ſee that glory of God in Chriſt, and
thoſe glorious treaſures of mercies,
that ſhall bee communicated, and are
now revealed, and thoſe dreadful evills
that are now threatned, and ſhall then
be fulfilled; I ſay if you could ſee them
with the ſame eyes that now is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
you ſhall ſee them with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
they would draw the hardeſt
heart that is, and bring downe the
ſtouteſt ſpirit that lives: If you had
faith you would bee able to ſee them
ſo; and the reaſon is, becauſe faith
ſees things as the word makes them
knowne, it pitches upon the word in
that way that it revealeth the mind of
God: now the word ſpeakes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that are to come, as <hi>preſent</hi> things,
and of evills that God intends to bring
herafter, as if God <hi>were</hi> now in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of them, as will appeare in theſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101279:91"/>
ſcriptures. <hi>Iſa. 52. 9. 10. Breake forth
into joy, ſing together yee waſte places of
Ieruſalem, for the Lord hath comforted his
people, he hath redeemed Ieruſalem: the
Lord hath made bare his holy arme in the
eyes of all the nations:</hi> thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
ſpeakes of the deliverance of the
Church from captivity, as a thing done
<hi>already,</hi> which was not fulfilled many
yeares <hi>after.</hi> And <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 57. 2.
even then when he fled from <hi>Saul</hi> in
the cave, hee lookes upon God as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
performed all things for him: the
word is, he hath <hi>perfected all things:</hi>
and that is obſervable, that <hi>David</hi> uſes
the ſame expreſſion of praiſing God
here when hee was in the cave, hiding
himſelfe to ſave his life, as hee did
when hee triumphed over his enemies,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108. And 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.
from the 17. verſe to the 22. as ſoone
as <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> had received the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
he falls on prayſing the Lord, as
if the mercy were already enjoyed:
<hi>praiſe ye the Lord, for his mercy endures
for ever.</hi> Chriſt ſaith of <hi>Abraham, John</hi>
8. 56. that <hi>he ſaw his day, and rejoyced,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101279:91"/>
and was glad:</hi> Chriſts day was unto
him as if it had beene then. And in
the 13. verſe of this chapter, it is ſaid
of the godly who lived in former ages,
that though they ſaw the promiſes
that were afarre off to be fulfilled, yet
the text ſayes,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>they imbraced them;</hi> the
word in the originall ſignifies, they <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
them;</hi> now ſalutations are not
but betweene friends when they meet
together. To <hi>faith</hi> a thouſand yeares
are but as <hi>one day,</hi> faith takes hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
eternall life. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 19. It takes
<hi>preſent</hi> poſſeſſion of the glorious
things of the kingdome of God: it
makes the ſoule to be in heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
with God, Chriſt, his Saints,
and Angels <hi>already.</hi> That which is
promiſed, faith accounts it given, <hi>Gen.</hi>
35. 12. And the land which <hi>I gave to
Abraham,</hi> to thee will I give it: it was
onely promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
faith made it to him as
<hi>given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So for <hi>judgements</hi> and <hi>threatnings,
Eſay 13. 6. Howle ye, for the day of the
Lord is at hand:</hi> this is ſpoken of the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101279:92"/>
deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> which was a
hundred and fifty yeares after; but
the word ſpeakes of it as if it were <hi>now,</hi>
and ſo <hi>faith</hi> apprehends it: the like
wee may inſtance in many Scriptures,
you know it is ordinary, and you who
know the worke of faith, you know it
is as ordinary for it, to looke at that
which God ſaies, as if it were now
done, &amp; things ſeene ſo work ſtrongly.</p>
               <p>What difference is there between
mens thoughts and judgements of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
and eternall things in times of
health, &amp; in times of their ſickneſſe, in
the apprehenſion of death? Aske them
<hi>now</hi> what they thinke of grace? of a
good conſcience? of the pardon of ſin?
of walking ſtrictly with God? Aske
them now what their judgement is of
Gods Saints? Aske them what they
thinke of eternal ſeparation from God,
and the infinite wrath of a Deity for
evermore? now you ſhall finde their
judgements otherwiſe then formerly:
and what is the reaſon of all? but that
things are judged now as <hi>preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>deſpaire</hi> brings hell into the ſoule,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101279:92"/>
and puts the ſoule as it were into hell
for the preſent, the ſoule apprehends
as if it were already there: many in the
horrour of their ſpirits have cryed
out that they were in hell. <hi>Francis
Spira</hi> in the deſpaire of his ſoule cryed
out, verily deſperation is hell it ſelfe.
So on the contrary, <hi>faith</hi> brings hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into the ſoule, puts it as it were
into heaven, ſo that many of Gods
people upon their ſick beds, when they
have beene put in minde of heaven,
they have joyfully anſwered, that they
were in heaven <hi>already.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> likewiſe makes uſe of things
paſt, as if they were preſent: as the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
mercies</hi> of God ſhewed to our
forefathers, and Gods former dealings
with our ſelves. As <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12. 4. the
mercy of God to <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with him and prevailed, the
Church makes uſe of it, as if it were a
preſent mercy to themſelves, for ſo
ſaith the text, <hi>he had power over the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
and prevailed; he wept and made ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
unto him; hee found him in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,
and there hee ſpake with us:</hi> not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:101279:93"/>
onely with <hi>Iacob,</hi> but with <hi>us:</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
mercy God ſhewed to <hi>him,</hi> we
make it <hi>ours,</hi> as if God were ſpeaking
with us, and <hi>Pſal. 66. 6. Hee turned the
ſea into dry land,</hi> they <hi>went through the
flood on foot, there did</hi> we <hi>rejoyce in them:</hi>
the comfort of the mercies of God for
many yeares paſt to their forefathers,
they make as theirs, <hi>there</hi> did <hi>wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So all the promiſes that God hath
made to any of his people, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo long agoe, <hi>faith</hi> fetches out the
comfort of them, as if they were made
<hi>now</hi> to us. Compare <hi>Joſhua</hi> 1. 5. with
<hi>Hebrewes</hi> 13. 5. God ſaith to <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> I
will be with thee, <hi>I will not faile thee,
nor forſake thee:</hi> now in the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> applyeth it to the beleevers
in his time, as if it had beene made to
them. <hi>Be content</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with ſuch
things as ye have,</hi> for hee hath ſaid, <hi>I
will not leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> They
might have anſwered, where hath God
ſaid ſo? hee ſaid it indeede to <hi>Ioſhua,</hi>
but what is that to us? yes, all one as
if he had ſpoken to <hi>you.</hi> Vpon this one
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101279:93"/>
inſtance, whatſoever promiſe God ever
made to any of his people, ſince the
beginning of the world, for any good,
if our condition comes to be the ſame,
<hi>Faith</hi> will make it her owne, as if God
had but now made it to us in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
So for Gods former dealings with
our ſelves, when all ſenſe of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
faile, that God ſeemes to be as an
enemy, <hi>Faith</hi> will fetch life from his
<hi>former mercies,</hi> as if they were now
preſent; as wee ſee in <hi>David, Pſal. 77.
5, 6. I have conſidered the dayes of old,
the yeeres of ancient time: I call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
my ſong in the night, &amp;c.</hi>
And verſ. 10. <hi>I ſaid, this is my infirmity,
but I will remember the yeeres of the right
hand of the moſt High.</hi> Hee checkes
himſelfe for doubting of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
becauſe of his <hi>former mercies,</hi> and
hee recovers himſelfe by bringing to
minde the former dealings of God
with them: So <hi>Pſal. 143. 45. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
ſpirit was even overwhelmed
within him, and his heart was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate,
yet he recovers himſelfe, by
<hi>remembring the dayes of old,</hi> and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101279:94"/>
by meditating upon Gods <hi>former
workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in this worke of <hi>Faith,</hi> what
abundance of ſtrength doth it bring in
from all the mercies of God to our
fore-fathers; from all the promiſes
made to any godly men, though never
ſo long ſince; from all Gods former
dealings in his goodneſſe, and makes
all theſe as preſent to us? this muſt
needs wonderfully ſtrengthen the heart
to any ſervice or ſuffering: As <hi>deſpaire</hi>
makes all Gods former dealings in his
judgements with others, and Gods
wayes concerning it ſelfe, as preſent to
fetch terror from them, ſo <hi>Faith</hi> Gods
mercies, to fetch comfort and ſtrength
from them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith</hi> is a raiſing grace,
it carries the ſoule on high, above ſenſe,
above reaſon, above the world: when
<hi>Faith</hi> is working, oh how is the ſoule
raiſed, above the feares and favours of
men! It is ſaid of <hi>Jehoſaphat, 2 Chron.
17. 6. His heart was lift up in the wayes
of God:</hi> Faith lifts up the heart in the
wayes of God. A man raiſed on high,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101279:94"/>
ſees all things under him as ſmall.<note place="margin">Nihil vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilium moror, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilium, ut Ieſum Chriſtum acquiram, ignis &amp; crux, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiarum, diſſipatio oſſium, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſio me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi>
tells us of a notable ſpeech that
<hi>Ignatius</hi> uſed, when hee was in his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
hands, not long before hee was
to ſuffer, which argued a raiſed ſpirit
to a wonderfull height, above the
world, and above himſelfe. I care
(ſayes hee) for nothing viſible or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
that I might get Chriſt: let fire,
the croſſe, the letting out of beaſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mee, breaking of my bones, the
tearing of my members, the grinding
of my whole body, and the torments
of the Devils come upon me, ſo be it
I may get Chriſt. <hi>Faith</hi> puts a holy
magnanimity upon the ſoule, to ſlight
and to over-looke with a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
whatſoever the world proffers
or threatens.</p>
               <p>All things are under us while wee
are above our ſelves, and it is onely
<hi>Faith</hi> that empties us of our ſelves, and
raiſes us above our ſelves; Faith raiſes
the ſoule to converſe with high and
glorious things, with the deepe and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
counſels of God, with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
myſteries of the Goſpel, with
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101279:95"/>
communion with God and Jeſus Chriſt,
with the great things of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Chriſt, with the great things
of Heaven and eternall life. Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Faith</hi> comes into their ſoules,
have poore low ſpirits, buſied about
meane and contemptible things, and
therefore every offer of the world pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes
with them, and every little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of ſuffering any trouble ſcares
them, and makes them yeeld to any
thing; but when <hi>Faith</hi> comes, there
is another manner of ſpirit in a
man.</p>
               <p>Every ſpirit is not fit for ſufferings,
but a ſpirit truely raiſed by Faith,<note place="margin">Audere ad nomen Chriſti pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculum vitae &amp; fortuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum adire, ad id re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiritur ſpiritus principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis. Luth.</note> a
princely ſpirit, ſo <hi>Luther</hi> calls it; to
dare to venture loſſe of <hi>eſtate</hi> and <hi>life</hi> for
the Name of Chriſt, to this a Princely
ſpirit is required. When <hi>Valens</hi> the
Emperour ſent his Officer to <hi>Baſilius,</hi>
ſeeking to turne him from the Faith,
hee firſt offered him great preferments,
but <hi>Baſil</hi> rejected them with ſcorne,
<hi>Offer theſe things,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>to children;</hi>
then he threatens him moſt grievouſly:
<hi>Baſil</hi> contemnes all his threatnings;

the offers of worldly preferments;
Why doe you promiſe us theſe ſmall
things of the world, which you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
great, when as the whole world
is deſpiſed by us? What great ſpirits
did <hi>Faith</hi> put into ſome of theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
mentioned in this chapter, which
appeares by the great things that they
did by their Faith? verſ. 33. 34. <hi>Through
Faith they ſubdued Kingdomes, they ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the mouthes of Lions:</hi> and this is
obſervable, that <hi>working righteouſneſſe,</hi>
and <hi>obtaining the promiſes</hi> are put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
theſe two; as if theſe were
workes of the ſame ranke, fit to bee
joyned with ſuch great things as thoſe
were. Againe, by Faith <hi>they quenched
the violence of the fire: of weake, they
were made ſtrong;</hi> they waxed valiant
in fight, they turned to flight the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Aliens.</p>
               <p>Certainely, <hi>Faith</hi> is as glorious a
grace now as ever it was, and if it be put
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101279:96"/>
forth it will enable the ſoule to doe
great things. The raiſing of the ſoule
above <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>ſenſe,</hi> is as great a
thing as any of theſe. The <hi>Faith</hi> of
<hi>Abraham</hi> was moſt glorious, for which
hee is ſtiled <hi>the Father of the faithfull,</hi>
and yet the chief for which this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
is, that <hi>hee beleeved againſt
hope, Rom.</hi> 4. 18. When the ſoule is in
ſome ſtraight, it lookes up for helpe;
and <hi>ſenſe</hi> ſayes it cannot be; <hi>reaſon</hi> ſayes
it will never be; <hi>wicked men</hi> ſay it ſhall
not be; yea, it may bee God in the
wayes of his providence ſeemes to goe
ſo croſſe, as if hee <hi>would not have it to
be;</hi> yet if Faith have a word for it, it
ſayes <hi>it ſhall be.</hi> In great difficulties,
in ſore afflictions, when God ſeemes
to be angry, and to ſtrike in his wrath,
when there appeares nothing to <hi>ſenſe</hi>
and <hi>reaſon,</hi> but wrath; yet even then
<hi>Faith</hi> hath hold on Gods heart, when
his hand ſtrikes.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Faith</hi> by raiſing the ſoule above
<hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>ſenſe,</hi> can carry it through
even ſuch ſtreights, as the ſenſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of the wrath of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:101279:96"/>
if it can enable to beare the
ſtrokes of God, when they appeare as
the ſtrokes of an enemy, much more
eaſily can <hi>Faith</hi> enable to reſiſt the
temptations of the world, and to carry
it through all the ſtraights that any
outward afflictions can bring it to. All
the ſtrength that the temptations that
come from the allurements of the
world, or the troubles that it threatens,
have,<note place="margin">Fides li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulis.</note> it is from <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>carnall reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi>
if the ſoule bee got above them,
then it is above the danger of ſuch
temptations: by that magnanimity
that <hi>Faith</hi> brings into the ſoule, it is
prepared to ſet upon difficult things,<note place="margin">Quem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que paupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, neque mors, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que vincu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la terrent.</note> to

is one, whom neither poverty, nor

can terrifie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith</hi> is a purifying and
<hi>healing grace, Act. 15. 9. Purifying their
hearts by Faith.</hi> It purges out baſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
after the things of the world, and
living at eaſe; baſe joyes and delights
in the creature, in ſatisfying the fleſh;
the feares of future evils that may
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:101279:97"/>
come hereafter:<note place="margin">Fides non timet fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul.</note> Faith feares not hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
ſaith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> If the heart bee
ſound, it will be ſtrong; this purging
of it makes it ſound, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 7. God
hath not given us the ſpirit of feare,</hi> ſayes
the Apoſtle, <hi>but of power, of love, and a
ſound minde:</hi> the ſpirit of feare is firſt
purged out, and then there is a ſpirit of
power, and a <hi>ſound minde;</hi> where there
is a ſound minde, there is a ſpirit of
<hi>power;</hi> what weakens the body but the
unſoundneſſe of it? If diſtempered hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
be in the body, 'tis not able to
endure any thing; a little cold, oh how
tedious is it to it? but when theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
are purged out, then it is ſtrong

But further, ſinne in the ſoule

much upon it: now where the

               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> Faith is a mighty <hi>prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

arme of an infinite power; it opens the
ſluce that lets out the ſtreames of an
infinite mercie, and cauſes an infinite

It is one thing to have intereſt
in God and Chriſt, and another thing
to have them working for good in a
ſpeciall manner, in particular cauſes
where wee deſire helpe and reliefe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be true, that God and Ieſus
Chriſt are alwayes working for the
good of beleevers, in ſome kind or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but yet when <hi>faith</hi> lyes ſtill and is

our intereſt in God, yet we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſuch ſenſible manifeſtations of the
gracious workings of God for us, as
when we put forth our <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>keepe</hi>
it active and lively; and then though
we be never ſo weake in our ſelves, wee
ſet an infinite ſtrength to worke for
us.</p>
               <p>Wee have a notable expreſſion of
Gods ſtirring up his ſtrength and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101279:99"/>
for thoſe whoſe hearts are right

hee does as it were ſtirre up all his

be in the darke, and know not how to
order our ſteps, and to diſcover the
ſubtilties of temptation, yet there is an
infinite wiſdome working for us; and
although we be never ſo unworthy and
vile, yet wee have an infinite mercy,
whoſe bowels yerne towards us, and
will not ſuffer any evill to befall us; yea
the more weake and ſuccourleſſe wee
are, in our ſelves, if the ſenſe of it
ſtirres up <hi>faith,</hi> to ſet God on work for
us, wee are ſtrong by our weakneſſe;
not onely of <hi>weake</hi> are made ſtrong, but
by <hi>being</hi> weake are made <hi>ſtrong.</hi> It is
ſaid of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, Rev.</hi>
3. 8. that <hi>it had a little ſtrength, and yet
it kept Gods Word, and had not denyed his

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101279:99"/>
ſtrength,</hi> yet if wee have <hi>faith</hi> to ſet
Gods ſtrength on worke, wee ſhall
keep Gods Word, and not deny his
Name.</p>
               <p>Hence in the ſixt place from all
theſe it followes,<note place="margin">4.</note> that faith is an <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming
grace:</hi> this is the victory that
overcommeth the world, <hi>even our
faith,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>John,</hi> Epiſtle 1 chap.
5. <hi>v.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>In this victorie, there are three
things. Firſt, there is a conquering of
the <hi>aſſaults</hi> of the world, ſo as they can
doe us no hurt, bnt wee are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the force of them.</p>
               <p>But this is not all, there is ſomething
further: namely the making uſe of
thoſe things of the world for our
good, that would have undone us, that
is a full victorie, where the enemies
doe not onely reſiſt and breake backe,
but he brings the conquered into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
ſo as now he is able to uſe the
adverſary to ſerve his owne turne:
ſo in this conqueſt of <hi>faith,</hi> there is
not onely an overcomming of the
temptations, of the pleaſures of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101279:100"/>
world, but abilitie to uſe them for
God, and the furtherance of our owne
good. And ſo in riches and honours:
Conquerours doe not uſe to put to the
ſword and deſtroy all they conquer,
but they bring them into bondage, to
be ſerviceable to them.</p>
               <p>Some thinke there is no other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over the world, but to throw
all away preſently: as wee reade of
<hi>Crates</hi> the Philoſopher,<note place="margin">Abite in profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, malae cupidita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ego vos mergam, ne ipſe mergar à vobis.</note> hee caſt his
goods into the ſea with this ſpeech,
<hi>Get you gone into the deepes, I will drowne
you, leſt I bee drowned of you.</hi> But this
is not the way of God, wee are to ſtay
till God call us to leave that we doe
enjoy;<note place="margin">Non fuga nec abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, ſed vigore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimi, &amp; conſtanti praeſentia Macrob. l. 2. Satur.</note> untill <hi>that</hi> time, you may enjoy
your <hi>honours,</hi> your <hi>riches,</hi> and your
moderate lawfull <hi>pleaſures;</hi> but to be
able to uſe theſe for God, this is a
great victory. The Devill often makes
uſe of many of Gods good bleſſings,
which he gives us for our furtherance
in his wayes, to be a meanes to hinder
us: ſo <hi>faith</hi> makes uſe of all his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
in thoſe waies, which hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
hinderances, to bee meanes of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101279:100"/>
great furtherance in them. In for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times men thought it a good
piece of skill, to keepe wilde beaſts
from doing hurt; but after they got
that skil, not onely to keepe them from
that miſchiefe they did, but to make
uſe of them for their benefit, to make
uſe of theis skinnes, and their intralls,
and divers other waies; this is the
skill of <hi>Faith</hi> in overcomming the
world, to make uſe of thoſe things of
the world that heretofore have done
them ſo much hurt.</p>
               <p>But yet further,<note place="margin">3.</note> there is a third thing
in victory, which is <hi>triumph:</hi> a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
can triumph over the world, over
all his allurements and threats; As
Chriſt did not onely prevaile againſt
his and our enemies, but triumphed
over them likewiſe, as <hi>Col. 2. 15. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſpoyled principalities, and powers,
he made a ſhew of them openly, triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over them: ſo Chriſt makes us to
triumph: as 2 Cor. 2. 14. Now thankes
bee to God, which alwaies cauſeth us to
triumph in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet further, there is ſomething
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101279:101"/>
more then all this in <hi>Faiths</hi> overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the world, which is beyond our
expreſſions. <hi>By Faith we are more then
conquerours, Rom.</hi> 8. 37. In all theſe
things wee are more then conquerers,
in what things? in <hi>tribulation,</hi> in <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi>
in <hi>famine,</hi> in <hi>nakedneſſe,</hi> and
<hi>perill of ſword, while we are killed all the
day long, and accounted as ſheepe for the
ſlaughter:</hi> in all theſe things. But how
<hi>more then conquerours?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ab ipſo ducunt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mumque ferro.</note> wee gather

                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:101279:101"/>
they overcame in being killed;
and this is to be more then a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101279:102"/>
precious faith, that is, the Faith of Gods

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith</hi> hath a mighty power of
God put forth for the working of it in
the ſoule: It is the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Gods power, the ſame <hi>that
raiſed Jeſus Chriſt from the dead,</hi> that
workes <hi>faith</hi> whereſoever ir is; and
God does not uſe to put forth his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty

thing; therefore <hi>faith</hi> muſt needes
bee ſome extraordinary thing, and
have ſome extraordinary vertue in it,
whereſoever it is <hi>true,</hi> to doe great

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> Faith hath the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
above all other graces, to be the
<hi>condition of the ſecond Covenant;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſurely it is ſome great matter that
<hi>faith</hi> enables to doe; whatſoever keeps
covenant with God, brings ſtrength,
though it ſelfe be never ſo weake: As
<hi>Sampſons Haire,</hi> what is weaker then a

therefore even a <hi>little Haire</hi> was ſo
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:101279:102"/>
great ſtrength to <hi>Sampſon:</hi> Faith then
that is the condition of the covenant, in
which all grace and mercy is contained,
if it be kept, it will cauſe ſtrength in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to doe great things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith</hi> hath high and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things for its object; it is God
himſelfe, his electing, redeeming love,
the Lord Ieſus Chriſt in his natures
and offices, the glorious myſteries of
redemption, &amp;c. that it exerciſes it ſelfe
upon: It could not have to deale with
theſe things, if it were not a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith</hi> hath high and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
acts that it performes, that are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall

               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> it hath many glorious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
it is that which muſt carry the
ſoule through all hazards, difficulties,
and oppoſitions to eternall life.</p>
               <p>Surely then this grace hath excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great things in it: certainely the
world is miſtaken in this grace: It is
ſomething elſe that they have taken up
for <hi>faith</hi> all this while; for there is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:101279:103"/>
nothing more dull, flat and dead, then
that which they take for Faith; their
hope in God, and truſting in God,
what empty, heartleſſe, liveleſſe things
are they? No marvell though they
thinke it an eaſie thing to beleeve; It
is eaſie indeed to beleeve with ſuch a
kind of beliefe as theirs is: Truly wee
had need looke to it, that wee be not
miſtaken in our Faith, for it is of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
conſequence, upon which all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends:
if we be miſtaken in this, all
the mercy in God, all the blood of
Chriſt, all the good in the promiſes
can doe nothing for us.</p>
               <p>Conſider therefore againe, ſurely
that cannot be right <hi>faith,</hi> that cannot
doe that which the light of nature can
doe, that meere civility and morality
can doe: Suppoſe it did as much as
they can doe, yet if it can doe no more,
it is not right, it is not that <hi>precious faith,</hi>
that will ſave the ſoule. Suppoſe a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
man ſhould get a ſtone, and ſtrike
fire with it, and hee concludes, ſurely
this is ſome precious ſtone, becauſe fire
is ſtricken out of it, why? every flint,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101279:103"/>
every ordinary ſtone that lyes in the
ſtreet, will doe as much as this: ſo if
a man ſhould thinke ſurely he hath that
<hi>precious faith,</hi> becauſe he can be ſober,
and temperate, juſt in his calling, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in all his dealings, chaſte in his
body, liberall to the poore; why? or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Heathens can doe this, they were
as <hi>temperate,</hi> as <hi>juſt,</hi> as <hi>chaſte,</hi> as <hi>liberall</hi>
as you, there needs no <hi>faith</hi> for this; It
is enough for a man to be a rationall
man to doe this, <hi>faith</hi> muſt have high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
operations then <hi>reaſon,</hi> or elſe it will
never carry to Heaven.</p>
               <p>But what if it does not enable thee
to doe as much as a <hi>beaſt</hi> can doe? as
to be temperate in meates and drinkes,
what kinde of faith doe you thinke this
is, when there are ſuch glorious things
ſaid of Faith, and yet that faith you
have, cannot enable you to doe ſo much
good as there is in a beaſt, will this
faith ſave you? What if it does not
enable you to doe ſo much as <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
faith?</hi> they beleeve, and tremble;
there are many things concerning God,
in his infinite juſtice, holineſſe, wrath,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101279:104"/>
many things concerning ſinne, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Chriſt, concerning eternity that
they beleeve, which thou beleeveſt
not; or if thou ſayeſt thou doſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
yet thou doſt not tremble, but
goeſt on boldly, ſecurely, preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
hard-heartedly, joyfully, in a
ſinfull and dangerous way, and is this
<hi>Faith?</hi> is this the precious Faith that
will ſave a Soule? That which thou
calleſt <hi>Faith,</hi> does not give thee ſtrength
to reſiſt any ſlight temptation; thou
canſt not deny a companion, thou canſt
not venture the loſſe of any thing, thou
canſt not endure a reproachfull word
for Chriſt, and is this Faith? Good
Lord, what doe wee make of Faith,
if this be Faith? Truely, if Faith had
nothing elſe in it, then the Faith of
the moſt hath, I would even fall to
the Vertues of Moralitie, for it were
farre beneath the meaneſt of them
all.</p>
               <p>Dare you venture your ſoules and
eternall eſtates upon this Faith? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely,
it were exceeding boldneſſe
and deſperateneſſe ſo to doe. What if
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101279:104"/>
God ſhould ſet all thy ſinnes in order
before thee, in the moſt hideous and
fearefull nature of them, in the true
deformitie and vileneſſe of them?
What if thou ſhouldſt ſee God in his
infinite Glorie, Majeſtie, Holineſſe, and
Iuſtice? If he ſhould ſhew thee how
thou haſt wronged all his <hi>Attributes,</hi>
how thou haſt ſtruck at his very <hi>Being,</hi>
how thou haſt beene an enemie to him
all thy life, reſiſting and oppoſing of
him in all thy wayes, darkened his
Glorie, contemned, ſlighted him, and
ſet up the creature, yea, thy luſt before
him; this I dare charge every Soule
as guiltie of, in ſome degree or other.
Suppoſe thou ſaweſt all the <hi>creatures</hi>
abuſed by thee, pleading againſt thee,
and all Gods Ordinances prophaned,
and all thy time miſ-ſpent, and the
bloud of Chriſt crying out againſt
thee. Suppoſe thou ſaweſt the <hi>Law,</hi>
full of the brightneſſe, of the holineſſe,
and juſtice of God, which thou haſt
broken. Suppoſe thou ſaweſt the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
ſtrictneſſe, and ſeveritie of it,
binding thee over to eternall death for
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:101279:105"/>
every breach, and putting thee under
an eternall Curſe for every offence.
Suppoſe <hi>Conſcience</hi> were let out upon
thee, and had commiſſion to accuſe
thee to the full, to flye in thy face for
all thy abuſes of it. Suppoſe <hi>Satan</hi>
were let out, to plead againſt thee, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
diſmall hideous terrors into thy
ſpirit. Suppoſe now all creatures were
readie to leave thee, to take their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
farewell of thee; and now the
infinite Ocean of Eternitie were before
thee, and thou wert to enter in upon
it, either for thy eternall happineſſe
or eternall miſerie. Suppoſe now thou
ſtoodſt before the great God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sentence of thy eternall
Doome, to have the great queſtion of
thy everlaſting eſtate to be abſolutely
and unalterably determined of. Now,
would ſuch a Faith, as thou haſt, carry
through theſe things? Would it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
thee from ſinking into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomeleſſe
Gulfe of Deſpaire? This
may be thy condition, thou knoweſt
not how ſoone; and that <hi>Faith</hi>
that thou haſt, of what uſe would
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101279:105"/>
it be to thee, in ſuch a condition as
this?</p>
               <p>If ever thou beeſt ſaved, thou muſt
have ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> as ſhall be able to
uphold thy heart, and keepe it unto
God, whenſoever ſuch a condition
ſhall befall: though Faith be weake,
yet if it be true, it enables the Soule
to lay ſuch faſt hold on God, as what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
befalls it, can never take off the
Soule from God againe. Be therefore
perſwaded, that <hi>Faith</hi> is another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Grace then you imagined it to
be: where Faith is true, it will doe
more then carry through outward
ſtreights, and hardſhips, it will carry
through ſpirituall ſtreights; into
which I have made a little digreſſion,
that I might convince men, that
they miſtake in that which they call
<hi>Faith.</hi>

Many who are weake, are diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
when they ſee men of eminent
parts, ſuch who have beene forward in
profeſſion; ſuch as were able to pray,
and to ſpeake admirably of Divine
things; ſuch as were able to adviſe,
and give counſell unto others; ſuch
as were of high eſteeme in the Church

They anſwer; <hi>For this very reaſon wee

<hi>that</hi> which the Adverſaries of the

               <p>Firſt know,<note place="margin">1.</note> that the leaſt degree of

that ever were in the world;<note place="margin">Why true Faith only will carry men tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</note> and true
<hi>Faith</hi> may be, where naturall parts are

appearance of <hi>common gifts:</hi> and on

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101279:107"/>
and ſcarce any common gifts, there
muſt needes be the leaſt: No; God
doth not diſpenſe this glorious grace
of Faith according to this proportion:
<hi>Not many wiſe, not many learned, but
God chuſeth the poore in this world to be
rich in faith:</hi> When the glorious My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries

<hi>revealed to thoſe that are Babes.</hi> Gods
wayes have uſually beene, to chooſe
weake and contemptible things to
honour himſelfe by, that the glory of
his Grace and Power might the more
appeare; and hath not ſo ordinarily
made uſe of men of great parts, that
have beene eminent and glorious in
the world, becauſe in them the grace
of God would not be ſo much honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
ſome of the honour would ſtick
to them.</p>
               <p>Conſider ſecondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> if the example
of <hi>theſe men</hi> were the ground of your
profeſſion of Religion, then their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
off might juſtly be your diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement:
but if you had better
grounds, if the evidence, the beautie,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:101279:108"/>
the authoritie, the power of, and love
unto the Truth, were your grounds;
then your grounds remaining, and the
Truth being the ſame, you ſhould
not be diſcouraged, but goe on in your
way.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> if you thinke to hold out
by the ſtrength of any degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
whatſoever that you could
ſee in them, then you might juſtly be
diſcouraged, becauſe you have not ſo
much as they had; all that you ſaw in
them, were <hi>gifts,</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion:</hi>
If you thinke that theſe ſhould
carry you through ſufferings, you are
utterly miſtaken; but if you make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that <hi>that</hi> which ſhould carry
you through, be another Principle, a
hidden one, that cannot be ſeene in
any, then there is no cauſe of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> hath not God acquainted
you with the infinite deceitfulneſſe of
the heart of man; That it is a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe
depth of evill, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
wicked, beyond that which any
is able to know but God himſelfe?
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101279:108"/>
And will you then depend upon man,
and that in a matter of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
as the cleaving to, or the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
of the Truth of God?</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> the falls of thoſe who have
beene thus eminent, are juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God upon hypocrites, and
thoſe that are carnall and naught, to
be a ſtumbling-blocke to them, at
which they ſhould fall, and breake

Now, if you ſhould ſtumble too at
this ſtumbling-blocke, it were an ill
ſigne, and a heavie judgement of God
againſt you; Therefore take heed,
that it prevailes not too farre with
you.</p>
               <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">6.</note> how doe you know, but
that theſe men, in the midſt of all their
profeſſion, had ſome ſecret ſinne main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in their boſomes, ſome ſecret
luſts that lay next their hearts? And
if ſo, no marvell though all the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

and contemptible, either in your owne
eyes, or in the eyes of others, <hi>you</hi> are,
the greater is the mercie of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, if he gives you a heart to

               <head type="sub">The difference betweene the heat of

of the heart by Faith, in ſuffering for
Chriſt.</head>
               <p>IF Faith be the Principle that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
through ſufferings,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> then let
men take heed, that they truſt not to
their owne Reſolutions; as if, becauſe
now they thinke they would ſuffer any
thing, let men doe what they can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, therefore they ſhall be
able to goe through: Many have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:101279:109"/>
themſelves in this. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene the heat of mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,
and the true heat of the
heart by Faith, is like the difference of
the heat of the Fowle breeding over
her egges, and the heat of the fire; the
one is a heat of life conveying life, but
not the other; Faith warmes the heart,
ſo as it conveyes life, but not ſo our
owne Reſolutions. Wee have had
many ſad experiences of the falſeneſſe
of mens hearts, from time to time in
this particular, who before the tryall
have beene very confident and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
yet they have moſt ſhamefully
failed, and falne off from the Truth,
when the tryall came.</p>
               <p>The example of Doctor <hi>Pendleton,</hi>
mentioned in the Booke of <hi>Martyrs,</hi>
is remarkable in this kind, the ſtorie is
generally knowne: The <hi>Doctor</hi> was
full of confidence and reſolution, and
profeſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That <hi>thoſe fat ſides of his
ſhould frie in the fire, before hee would
yeeld;</hi> and yet how ſhamefully he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke
the Cauſe of God, you all know.
Thoſe who vaunt moſt, have many
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:101279:110"/>
times the leaſt courage, as thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
who have the greateſt hearts of
fleſh, are the moſt timerous, as the <hi>Stag,</hi>
the <hi>Panther,</hi> and the <hi>Hare.</hi> It is not
enough that men, in the profeſſion of
their reſolutions, ſpeake as they thinke,<note place="margin">Ambula in timore &amp; contemptu tui, &amp; ora Dominum ut ipſe tua omnia fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat, &amp; tu nihil fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias, ſed ſis Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti: Ad Gabrielem Vydymum paſtorem Aldenbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſem.</note>
and as they are perſwaded for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
this is not to be truſted to: for <hi>he
that truſts his owne heart, is a foole,</hi> ſayes
<hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 28. It is good counſell
<hi>Luther</hi> gives a <hi>German</hi> Miniſter, in an

and contempt of your ſelfe, and pray

               </p>
               <p>What reſolutions are thoſe that are
like to faile,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> and to come to nothing in
times of tryall.<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, raſh reſolutions, when men
reſolve without ſerious conſideration,
what ſufferings meane, what they will
coſt them, and how hard they will bee
to them when they come; they doe not
make them as preſent to them, by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:101279:110"/>
before they reſolve; <hi>reſolution,</hi>
in ſuch things, ſhould be the fruit of
much meditation; there neede bee
much <hi>muſing</hi> before this <hi>fire</hi> breake
forth.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> when there is no broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſpirit joyned with their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but their hearts are puffed up,
pride diſcovering it ſelfe, as in other of
their wayes, ſo even in their very reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of ſuffering great things for
God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> when men reſolve what they
will doe, but for the preſent they can
ſuffer nothing; if they be croſſed never
ſo little, their hearts riſe, they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with diſtempered paſſions, they
cannot beare any contradiction, but
muſt have their owne wills, and their
owne turnes ſerved, or elſe there can be
no quiet with them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> when men reſolve for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<hi>hereafter,</hi> but have no heart to
that <hi>preſent</hi> ſervice, which God calls
now to, God hath little honour from
them that way, they are negligent and
looſe in preſent duties; ſurely theſe
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101279:111"/>
men, who faile thus in ſervice, are not
like to hold out in ſuffering, let them
reſolve what they will.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> when men are full of <hi>reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and ſpeake great words that way,
but they doe nothing to lay up and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for ſufferings. What care and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
is there to cleanſe the heart?
to ſtrengthen Faith? to get more full
ſenſe of Gods love? to provide ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
armour? what prayers? what
teares are ſent up to God afore-hand?
Strong reſolutions, if they bee right,
will bring forth ſtrong endeavours;
otherwiſe they will certainely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6.</note> when mens reſolutions
come from externall principles, they
are acted by ſomething from <hi>without
them,</hi> as the examples of others, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
from others, or perſwaſions by
others, more then from any principle
<hi>within</hi> themſelves. We read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.
34. thoſe Chriſtians there mentioned
held out in their reſolutions, to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the ſpoiling of their goods with
joy, <hi>knowing within themſelves,</hi> that in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:101279:111"/>
Heaven they had an enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
they had their principles <hi>within</hi>
themſelves.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7.</note> when <hi>reſolutions</hi> come
meerely from <hi>anguiſh of mens ſpirits,</hi> in
regard of preſent trouble that men are
in, from the hand of God upon them, it
may be then they will reſolve to doe
or ſuffer any thing; but theſe reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſeldome come to any thing: It is
ſtrange that men ſhould truſt to them,
conſidering the abundances of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
both from themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that they have had of the uſuall
falſeneſſe of them.</p>
               <p>Eighthly,<note place="margin">8.</note> when <hi>reſolution</hi> comes
meerely from <hi>conviction of conſcience,</hi>
and not from any love to truth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
conſcience ſhall tell a man if he
forſakes God and his truth, to prevent
ſome preſent troubles, that <hi>that</hi> evill
which he ſhall bring upon himſelfe (in
regard of the guilt of ſinne, and the
wrath of God againſt him) will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
greater then any hee can ſuffer,
yet if there bee not a true love to the
truth, there is no hold of this man, his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101279:112"/>
corrupt heart will breake all the bonds
of conſcience.</p>
               <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">9.</note> when men truſt to their
<hi>owne promiſes</hi> they make to God, to
ſtand for his truth, more then to <hi>Gods
promiſes,</hi> that promiſe ſtrength to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them to it; they are confident,
becauſe they are reſolved they ſhall
goe through,<note place="margin">Why mens own good will not carry them through godly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note> and ſo let the promiſe of
God lye, and make no uſe of it; now
theſe reſolutions are not like to carry
men through ſufferings, at leaſt not in
a gracious manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> becauſe they are but <hi>naturall,</hi>
and naturall ſtrength can carry no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then it hath naturall props and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
to uphold it, and maintaine it
withall, which may all faile in ſome
kinde of ſuffering that God may call
unto.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> there is much difference
in mens apprehenſions from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
at one time they apprehend
things ſtrongly one way, at another
time another way; eſpecially when
things come to be <hi>preſent,</hi> their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of them are farre different
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:101279:112"/>
from that they were, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
them as <hi>future.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> there is a great deale of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the frame of a mans heart, to
his owne feeling when his luſts <hi>lye ſtill,</hi>
from that which there is when they
come to be <hi>ſtirring:</hi> ſometimes mens
corruptions are reſtrained, and are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
quiet, and then they have good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,
at other times their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are ſtirring and active, and then
they are quite off from that they were,
the mind is blinded, the heart is carried
on violently in wayes contrary to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
reſolutions.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> men know not the <hi>ſtrength
of temptations</hi> before they meet with
them, they thinke it is an eaſie matter
to encounter with them, but when they
come, they finde them farre ſtronger
then they imagined, and they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prepared for ſuch ſtrength, are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
by them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> it may be when ſufferings
come, men ſhall not finde that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
that encouragement, that they
<hi>expected</hi> either from God or men, they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:101279:113"/>
(it may be) made account of, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to themſelves great matters, that
ſurely their paines and troubles would
be much eaſed with the comforts they
ſhould have, and many would encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them, and, it may be, when it comes
too, they may be left deſolate, <hi>as a bottle
in the ſmoak;</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf.
God many times even in ſufferings
withdrawes himſelfe from his owne
people for a while, for their tryall; and
thoſe from whom they expected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
may leave them, and grow ſtrange
unto them: Now if there be no higher
principle then ones owne reſolutions,
the heart will faile: In ſuch a caſe,
there had neede bee <hi>Faith</hi> to carry
through.</p>
               <p>But may wee not <hi>reſolve</hi> then afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
what we will doe?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Many upon hearing how others
faile,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> in performing their reſolutions,
and that a man may be very confident
of what hee will doe, and yet when it
comes to tryall, doe nothing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they thinke it is in vaine to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve,</hi>
they goe on in a ſlight negligent
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:101279:113"/>
way, and never endeavour to bring
their hearts to any reſolution at all,
they ſay wee can doe nothing of our
ſelves, God muſt doe all, no man
can know what hee ſhall be able to
doe, before the tryall comes; but it is
apparent, that the cauſe why theſe men
doe not come to any reſolutions, is not
from any true ſenſe of their weakneſſe:
For,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> their hearts are not humbled
before God in the ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> they doe nothing to
ſtrengthen themſelves, to help againſt
any ſuch weakneſſe of theirs, as they
ſpeake of: if you be ſo weake, you
had need take much paines afore-hand
to get ſtrength, to lay up ſomething
that may helpe in the time of need: but
the reaſon why you never come to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,</hi>
is:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> becauſe of the ſluggiſhneſſe
of your ſpirits; you will not take
paines in examining your hearts, and
in endeavouring in the uſe of meanes
to attaine to this.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> there are engagements
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:101279:114"/>
betweene your hearts, and the world,
and ſinfull diſtempers, which you are
unwilling to breake off, which muſt
be broken off, if ever you come to any
true reſolutions, which are like to
hold.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> ſufferings are ſuch tedious
things to you, as you cannot endure to
thinke of them afore-hand, much leſſe
make account of them, ſo as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for them, ſuch thoughts would
trouble you, they would damp your
carnall joy, you could not goe on ſo
quietly and ſecurely in the enjoyment
of your contentments in the world, as
now you doe, when you put off all
thoughts of ſuffering any trouble.</p>
               <p>But let ſuch know,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> for Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and how attained.</note> that reſolution
afore-hand may ſtand with broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of heart, from the ſight and ſenſe
of our owne inability; and when it is a
reſolution of faith, it ariſeth from the
ſenſe of our owne weakeneſſe,
and dependence upon God for ſtrength:
none are more ſenſible of their owne
weakneſſe, then they who are moſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,</hi>
whoſe <hi>reſolutions</hi> are raiſed by
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:101279:114"/>
their faith; for <hi>Faith</hi> is an emptying

               <p>EXamine therefore whether <hi>Faith</hi> be
that which carries us on in our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings:<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note>
for it is poſſible that a man may
ſuffer the loſſe of much, and endure
hard things upon other principles; as
from naturall <hi>ſtoutneſſe of ſpirit,</hi> from
naturall courage, or from <hi>pride,</hi> or
from <hi>naturall conſcience,</hi> from theſe
there may be reſiſting oppoſitions, and
ſuffering much trouble, but not in that
gracious way, as to bee a ſweet ſavour
unto the Lord. Where <hi>Faith</hi> is the
roote and principle of ſelfe-denyall,
there is another kinde of ſelf-denyall
then that which ariſeth from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
principle: Now this is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
it concernes us much to know
the root and principle from whence all
that we doe or ſuffer comes, God looks
moſt at that; there may be beautifull
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:101279:116"/>

that there are betweene one that is
carryed through ſufferings by naturall
<hi>ſtoutneſſe of ſpirit,</hi> and another that is
carryed through by <hi>Faith.</hi> Secondly,
the differences betweene <hi>Pride</hi> and

Firſt, where ſelfe-denyall is from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Principles,</hi> it is but particular,
not univerſall. In ſome eminent thing,
a naturall ſpirit may denie it ſelfe; but
upon examination it may appeare, that
in other things it makes ſelfe its end,
even in things where God requires
ſelfe-denyall, as much as in the other:
whereas, if it came from <hi>Faith,</hi> it
would not be partiall, but appeare in
one thing as well as in another, ſo farre
as God calls thereunto; that which
workes by rule, workes evenly, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,
conſtantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:101279:116"/>
But there is none,<note place="margin">Object.</note> but in ſome things
may at ſometimes ſeeke themſelves.</p>
               <p>There is nothing wherein a gracious
ſpirit gives libertie to its ſelfe ſo to
doe.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> If there be true <hi>Faith,</hi> the Soule
ſets it ſelfe in the bent, frame, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
of it, againſt all ſelf-ſeeking,
in every thing proportionably, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the rule requires: if <hi>ſelfe</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes
at any time, it is beyond the
ſcope, intent, frame, reſolution, and
true endeavour of the Soule; and when
that, wherein <hi>ſelfe</hi> hath prevailed is
taken notice of, it takes revenge upon
it ſelfe in that thing rather then any
other.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> where ſuffering troubles
come from a <hi>Naturall Root,</hi> the Soule
is not conſcious to its ſelfe of its owne
weakeneſſe; it knowes not the power
of corruption in the heart, it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
not how <hi>ſelfe</hi> may be ſought, in
denying ones ſelfe: ſuch a one is not
acquainted with the ſecret diſtempers,
thoſe inward windings and turnings
of his owne heart; thoſe depths, thoſe
wiles, thoſe devices of Satan, and of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:101279:117"/>
his owne ſpirit: he ſeeth not need of
a higher Principle, to enable him to
any gracious manner of ſelfe-denyall;
he lookes at it, but as a thing within
his owne reach; he is not fearefull,
and jealous of himſelfe. But it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
where ſelfe-denyall comes
from <hi>Faith;</hi> the buſineſſe and worke
of <hi>Faith,</hi> is the getting up on high, and
fetching ſtrength from on high, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Soule in its ſelfe hath
nothing but corruption and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> when it comes from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Principles,</hi> there may be ſome
appearance of ſelfe-denyall in <hi>outward
actions,</hi> and willingneſſe to ſuffer, but
there is little care of mortifying <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Luſts;</hi> Luſts <hi>within</hi> are ſuffered
to ſwell, to rankle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and feſter. Naturall
Principles doe not ſtrike at the <hi>root</hi> of
evill; there may be a reſtraint of ſome
evill, but the root of bitterneſſe <hi>ſtill</hi>
remaines in the ſtrength of it: but
<hi>Faith</hi> begins within, it workes to the
<hi>bottome,</hi> and ſtrikes at the root of evill,
at all the corrupt <hi>Principles</hi> that are in
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:101279:117"/>
the inwards of the Soule; it empties
out <hi>ſelfe</hi> from the moſt ſecret inward
holds that it had, it will not ſuffer <hi>ſelfe</hi>
to lye in any ſecret corner.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> when bearing ſufferings
ariſe from <hi>Naturall Stoutneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;</hi>
ſuch a one does neither begin,
nor ſtrengthens himſelfe afterwards,
upon divine grounds and arguments, ſo
as the Beleever doth: his willingneſſe
to ſuffer, does not proceed out of love
to God, for his infinite excellencie, as
infinitely worthy, that whatſoever the
creature is, hath, or can doe, or ſuffer,
ſhould be at his diſpoſe; the Lord
hath dealt infinitely bountifully with
me, he hath beene mercifull to me, and
ſet his love upon me: Now, theſe
beames of Gods love, warming, and
enlarging, and quickening the heart of
a Beleever, ſets him even on fire to doe
or ſuffer any thing for God. But thoſe
who are carryed on upon <hi>Naturall
Principles,</hi> feele no ſuch thing; neither
doe they make uſe of ſpirituall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
or ſpirituall arguments, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
them, as Faith does.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:101279:118"/>
Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> where naturall <hi>Stoutneſſe</hi>
and <hi>Courage</hi> is the Principle, there the
Soule is not rayſed higher in its cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
for God, then when the cauſe
onely concernes it ſelfe; it diſcovers
as much ſtoutneſſe and courage in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
things, as it does in ſpirituals:
But this ſtrength in ſufferings, that
comes from <hi>Faith,</hi> is a ſtrength farre
more rayſed in the cauſe of God, and
ſpirituall things, then in any other. In
other things, it may be the heart is
weake, full of feares, knowes not how
to withſtand any evill: but in the cauſe
of God, it findes a Principle, carrying
it beyond that it is otherwiſe; <hi>There</hi>
it is full of courage, it is able to looke
upon the face of any man, to ſtand out
againſt the proudeſt perſecuters. As
that Martyr <hi>Alice Driver</hi> told the
perſecuters, That <hi>though ſhe was brought
up at the Plough, yet in the cauſe of Chriſt
ſhe would ſet her foot againſt the foot of
any of them all.</hi> Many poore weake
women, and children, have manifeſted
that courage and boldneſſe in the cauſe
of Chriſt, that hath daunted the hearts
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:101279:118"/>
of their enemies. As we reade, <hi>Acts</hi>
4. 13. when the <hi>Rulers, Elders,</hi> and
<hi>Scribes,</hi> ſaw <hi>the boldneſſe</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>John,</hi> and <hi>perceived that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
and ignorant men, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled,
and they tooke knowledge of them,
that they had beene with Jeſus.</hi> It was
their being with Jeſus, it was their
<hi>faith</hi> in Chriſt, that rayſed them
higher then their naturall Principles,
ſo as to make their enemies to wonder
at them.</p>
               <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">6.</note> the power of reſiſting ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
that comes from <hi>Naturall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
is not a fruit of much humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
brokenneſſe of heart, ſeeking of
God aforehand. When <hi>Eſther</hi> was in
hazard, when ſhe was to goe about a
worke, wherein all her honour and her
life muſt be ventured, ſhee falls to
<hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> and cauſeth others
to <hi>faſt</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> for her; and ſo ſhee
came to that reſolution, <hi>If I periſh, I
periſh.</hi> Men full of <hi>ſtoutneſſe,</hi> and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<hi>courage,</hi> thinke that mournings
for ſinne, breakings of the heart in
godly ſorrow, keeping downe the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:101279:119"/>
Soule in humiliation, make men timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and Cowards; that it abates, if
not wholly takes away their valour and
ſtoutneſſe: but Gods people never
find more courage and heavenly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
then after much humiliation for
ſinne; the more brokenneſſe of heart
<hi>for</hi> ſinne, the more ſtoutneſſe and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in reſiſting <hi>of</hi> ſinne, and in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any evill, rather then to admit any
ſinne. Wicked men indeed have ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and courage, for the maintaining
of their luſts, in which the courage and
ſtoutneſſe of the world is eſpecially
let out; but all the courage and ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of godly men, is in oppoſing of
ſinne, and in doing and ſuffering for
God.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7.</note> if there be onely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſtrength to enable to a willingneſſe
to venture upon any way of ſuffering,
there cannot be that <hi>confidence of a good
iſſue</hi> that <hi>Faith</hi> brings with it, where
<hi>that</hi> is the Principle. <hi>Faith</hi> can aſſure
the Soule, that the iſſue ſhall be good,
whatſoever ſeemes to the contrarie;
although the ſufferings ſeeme to be
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:101279:119"/>
never ſo black and diſmall, <hi>Faith</hi> can
looke beyond all to a glorious iſſue,
and through the aſſurance of this, can
keepe the Soule in a ſpirituall heavenly
ſecuritie, in the midſt of all evils that
doe befall it. The confidence of that
glorious iſſue of all ſufferings, that the
Faith of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> rayſed his heart
unto, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, 18. is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
<hi>For our light affliction, which is
but for a moment</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>worketh for
us a farre more exceeding and eternall
weight of glory, while wee looke not at
things that are ſeene, but at the things
which are not ſeene, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eightly,<note place="margin">8.</note> 
                  <hi>Naturall Principles</hi> cannot
welcome afflictions with ſuch <hi>joy</hi> and
delight as <hi>Faith</hi> can. How have the
<hi>Martyrs</hi> kiſſed and embraced the Stake,
accounting that day the happieſt day
that ever they ſaw. It is ſaid of the
Chriſtians in the 10. <hi>Heb. 34. That they
ſuffered with joy the ſpoyling of their
goods.</hi> Faith does not onely enable to
ſuffer with <hi>patience,</hi> but to ſuffer with
<hi>joy.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth,
<hi>wee rejoyce in tribulations.</hi> Now others
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:101279:120"/>
by their naturall courage may encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with afflictions, and perhaps they
may endure them with ſome <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
but they cannot thus <hi>rejoyce</hi> in
them.</p>
               <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">9.</note> where <hi>Naturall Strength</hi>
onely enables, there the ſoule is not
more humble, after it hath gone
through difficulties, but it is puffed up,
as having paſſed through hard things,
and done ſome great matter; but
where <hi>Faith</hi> is the principle, the ſoule
knowes that it was not from any thing
in its ſelfe; but if it had beene left to
its ſelfe, it ſhould have baſely forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the cauſe of God, it ſhould have
diſhonoured God and its holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
and therefore it rejoyces not
in its ſelfe, but in that power from on
high, that came in and aſſiſted it. <hi>I live,</hi>
ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, but not I,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt
in me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revera gloriari in Solo Deo non nisi à Solo Deo eſt. Bern. Serm. in Cant. 13.</note> ſo <hi>I was able to goe through ſuch
and ſuch ſtraights,</hi> ſaith a beleeving
ſoule; <hi>No, not I, but the vertue and
power of Chriſt in me carried me through.</hi>
Of a truth, ſaith <hi>Bernard, To glory in
God alone, cannot be but from God alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:101279:120"/>
Tenthly,<note place="margin">10.</note> if the principle bee onely
<hi>naturall courage,</hi> although ſuch a one
may be very ready at firſt in denying
himſelfe, yet if after hee be croſſed
more then hee expected, and findes

he does not ſee ſome naturall good
comming in, hee is ſoone diſcouraged,
the heart ſinkes, as not having ſufficient
to uphold it and carry it out in that it
hath undertaken.</p>
               <p>Yet further,<note place="margin">Sufferings out of Pride.</note> ſuch is the deceit of a

wicked, and deceitfull,
one would wonder how this ſhould
bee.</p>
               <p>The men of the world are ready to caſt
this aſperſion upon <hi>all</hi> that ſuffer, they
ſay they ſuffer out of <hi>vain-glory,</hi> &amp; ſo if
they be forward in ſervice, they ſtill ſay
it is from the <hi>pride</hi> of their hearts; when
they can ſay nothing againſt the things
they <hi>doe</hi> or <hi>ſuffer,</hi> then they judge their
hearts: this ſhewes, that to ſuffer for
God, or to be forward in ſervice is a
glorious thing, otherwiſe why ſhould
they thinke men doe them to ſeeke glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
by them; but although it be a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that ariſes from their malicious
hearts againſt the truth, to accuſe the
ſufferings of Gods people of vaine
glory, yet certainely there may bee a
principle of <hi>pride,</hi> that may carry men
on even <hi>here;</hi> but there is much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene that ſuffering that a

that which a man is carried through by

               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:101279:121"/>
Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> if <hi>pride</hi> be the principle, a man
is ready to put forth himſelfe though
he be not called: It is true that in ſome
extraordinary cauſes, a man may have
an inward calling, by ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
motion of Gods Spirit, as ſome
of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> had; but in an ordinary
way, a gracious heart feares it ſelfe,
and dares not venture untill God calls,
depending more upon Gods call, then
any ſtrength it hath to carry it through:
<hi>Faith</hi> ever lookes at a <hi>word;</hi> It puts on
to nothing, but according to the word;
where there is not a <hi>word</hi> to warrant,
there we may conclude, that <hi>faith</hi> is not
the principle that acts, but <hi>ſelfe.</hi> True
Chriſtian fortitude leades into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
onely by divine providence or
precept, when God bids a man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
dangers, or bids dangers overtake
him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> where <hi>pride</hi> is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſuch a one cares not much how the
cauſe of God goeth on, any further
then he is intereſted in it, if God will
uſe others to honour his Name by, and
further his cauſe, except hee may ſome
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:101279:122"/>
way come in, he regards it not, hee is
not more ſollicitous, how the cauſe of
God in other things that concerne
not his ſufferings proſpers; howſoever
therefore he may ſpeak much of Gods
glory, in that cauſe for which hee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
yet if he be not affected with the
glory of God in any other cauſe, that
concernes not his particular, it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that it is his owne glory, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then Gods, that is aimed at.</p>
               <p>3.<note place="margin">3.</note> Thirdly, a proud heart does not
ſtrengthen it ſelfe ſo much in ſufferings,
with the conſolations of God, the
ſweet of the promiſes, as it doth with
its <hi>owne-ſelfe-proud thoughts;</hi> the heart is
not taken up ſo much with the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reward of God in Heaven, that
ſpirituall and ſupernaturall glory there,
as with ſome preſent <hi>ſelfe-good</hi> here;
whereas <hi>Faith</hi> is altogether for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and ſupernaturall good, it carries
the ſoule beyond preſent things, that
are onely ſutable to nature.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> where <hi>pride</hi> is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
there is no good got by ſufferings,
the ſoule doth not thrive under them,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:101279:122"/>
it doth not grow in grace by them, it
growes not to a further inſight in <hi>Gods</hi>
wayes, it growes not more holy, more
heavenly, more ſavoury in all the
wayes of it, the luſtre and beauty of
godlineſſe does not encreaſe upon ſuch
a one, hee is not more ſpirituall, hee
doth not cleave cloſer to God; hee is
not more frequent with God in ſecret,
he doth not enjoy more inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God then formerly;
whereas when our principle is right in
ſuffering, there is never ſuch thriving
in grace as then, <hi>then</hi> the Spirit of God,
and glory uſeth to reſt upon Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
a godly mans <hi>ſervice</hi> prepares
him for ſuffering, and his <hi>ſuffering</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
him for ſervice. The Church

               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> where <hi>pride</hi> is the principle,
there is not that calmeneſſe, <hi>meekneſſe,

of its owne unworthineſſe, that God
ſhould uſe him in ſuffering, or help him
through it in any meaſure, wondering
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:101279:123"/>
at the mercy of God, and bleſſing his
Name, that whereas he might have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
from his wrath for ſinne in Hell
for ever, that yet God will rather call
him to ſuffer for his Names ſake: where
it is from a ſpirituall principle, this
will be.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7.</note> if from <hi>vaine-glory,</hi> then
in ſuch kinde of ſufferings that will bee
reproachfull to him, and where there
are none to honour him in them, there
he failes; if God call him to ſom kinde
of ſufferings, wherein he ſhould be <hi>laid
by,</hi> as a vile and contemptible thing,
and nobody regarding of him, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of him, theſe ſufferings
would be very tedious to him; or if
he lives in ſuch a place where none will

if it be the cauſe of God, it is enough
to <hi>faith,</hi> it is able to rejoyce in the

can caſt upon it: if that which bee

is very obſervable: <hi>What glory is it, if
when ye be buffeted for your fault yee take
it patiently? but if when you doe well, and
ſuffer, ye take it patiently, this is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with God.</hi> Mark the oppoſition: If
it had beene <hi>direct,</hi> it would have beene
thus; What glory is it, if when yee are
buffeted yee take it patiently, but if
you doe well, and ſuffer patiently, this
is glorious, there is no glory in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but in <hi>this</hi> is glory, that is the
meaning of the Apoſtle, but hee does
not ſay <hi>this is glory,</hi> but this <hi>is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
to God; and in that hee ſayes as
much, for that is the greateſt glory to
a gracious heart, that any thing that he
does or ſuffers may be <hi>acceptable to God,</hi>
let it appeare outwardly never ſo
meane and baſe.</p>
               <p>Eighthly,<note place="margin">8.</note> if it be <hi>vaine-glory,</hi> then
greater reſpect and honour in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing will take him off: If the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in another thing be greater then
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:101279:124"/>
that he hath by his ſufferings, hee will
quickly grow weary of his ſufferings,
and will finde out ſome diſtinction or
other to winde himſelfe out of them.
Many who have beene taken off this
way, have ſuffered much a while,
but finding it heavie, and ſeeing another
way, wherein they thinke they might
better provide for themſelves, they
have by degrees falne off to it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

a deſire of revenge, hee would if
he could return evill for evill, and doth
as farre as hee dares. The heart is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
againſt thoſe from whom they
doe ſuffer; but thoſe who have <hi>Faith</hi>
to be their principle, they commit their
cauſe to God; <hi>though men curſe, they
bleſſe,</hi> they can heartily pray for their
perſecuters, as Chriſt and <hi>Stephen</hi> did
for theirs. The Banner over a gracious
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:101279:125"/>
heart, in all the troubles that befall it,
is Love; and therefore, whatſoever
the wrongs be that are offered to ſuch,
there is ſtill a Spirit of Love preſerved
in it.</p>
               <p>Tenthly,<note place="margin">10.</note> if <hi>vaine-glory</hi> be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
hee loves to make his ſufferings
knowne, and in the making of them
knowne, he will aggravate them with
all the circumſtances he can, to make
them appeare the more grievous, that
ſo hee in the ſuffering of them, may
appeare the more glorious. It is a good
obſervation that Maſter <hi>Brightman</hi>
hath upon that expreſſion of Saint
<hi>John, Rev. 1. 9. I was in the Ile that is
called</hi> Patmos, he does not ſay, <hi>I was
baniſhed into the Ile, by the wicked cruelty
and malice of mine enemies;</hi> No, onely
thus, <hi>I was in the Ile.</hi> The humble man
rather deſires that his ſufferings might
make God knowne, then that <hi>himſelfe,</hi>
or any others ſhould make his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings

whereas the other makes his boaſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in regard of our ſervices or ſufferings,
makes both us, and all that we doe or
ſuffer, to be vile and baſe in the eyes of
God and man. It is a notable witty

be, where there is true ſanctifying and

ſuffered much in their way of Religion,
out of the principle of a <hi>naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>

be poiſoned, for oppoſing the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of Gods, teaching that there
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:101279:126"/>
was but one God. In a way of juſtice,
the Naturall Conſcience of <hi>Fabritius</hi>
ſet him ſo ſtrong againſt any oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it was ſaid of him, That <hi>you
might ſooner turne the courſe of the Sunne,
then</hi> Fabritius <hi>from the courſe of juſtice.</hi>
Now, Naturall Conſcience may put a

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> by the ſtrength of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
it hath of ſome Truths of

Divine Authoritie that there is in
them, of the dependance they have
upon the <hi>prima veritas,</hi> the firſt Truth,
which is God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>Naturall Conſcience</hi> may
be convinced of a greater good that
there is in the enjoyment of the peace
and quiet of the mind, then in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of all outward comforts
whatſoever; and a greater evill in the
torment of ſpirit, and miſerie that will
follow, if any thing be done againſt
that light it hath, then there is in all
evils that the world can inflict.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>Naturall Conscience</hi> may ſo
urge Truths upon the Soule, it may ſo
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101279:126"/>
follow it with importunitie, caſting
feares and terrors into the heart, that it
will never ſuffer the Soule to be at
quiet, in a way of ſelfe-ſeeking, in any
way of providing for the fleſh, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to that light that God hath ſet up
in it. Wherefore, although there be
not much naturall courage in a man,
nor ſeeking vaine-glory from men; yet
the loſſe of many comforts, and many
evils may be ſuffered, out of the power
of the light that there is in a Naturall
Conſcience. But there is much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene this kind of ſuffering,
and that which comes from a Principle
of <hi>Faith:</hi> as thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> where it is onely from a <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Conſcience,</hi> the Soule is urged, and
put on by force of a command; but it
is not encouraged by, it receives not
ſtrength from, it is not ſweetened with
the Promiſe; it findes no Promiſe of
the ſecond Covenant, at leaſt no abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to cloſe with any Promiſe, from
whence it receives helpe in the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings:
but where there is a Principle
of <hi>Faith,</hi> the Soule findes three ſorts
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:101279:127"/>
of <hi>Promiſes</hi> in the Goſpel, with which
it cloſeth, from which it findes much
helpe: As firſt, the Promiſes of <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;</hi>
ſecondly, the Promiſes of
<hi>acceptance;</hi> thirdly, the Promiſes of
<hi>reward,</hi> both here and eternally here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
Theſe, <hi>Naturall Conſcience</hi> hath
no skill in; it puts on a man to ſuffer,
but it gives no ſtrength; he goeth to
it in his owne ſtrength: Conſcience
urgeth the Soule, ſo as it dares not doe
otherwiſe; but it doth not aſſure it,
that God accepts either of perſon or
performance: it lookes to preſent
quiet, having nothing to perſwade it,
that it ſhall at length attaine unto the
glorious reward that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
unto thoſe who ſuffer out of
<hi>faith</hi> for his Name ſake.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>Naturall Conſcience</hi> doth
not make a man glad of that light it
hath, and the power and activeneſſe
that there is in it; that it will not ſuffer
him to be at quiet, unleſſe he doe denie
himſelfe in that which is deare unto
him: if he had not that light which
he hath, he might enjoy himſelfe in his
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:101279:127"/>
owne way, without that trouble and
vexation of ſpirit that now he feeles;
he therefore oppoſeth and ſeekes to
extinguiſh his light, rather then to uſe
any meanes to maintaine and cheriſh
it: but where there is a Principle of
<hi>Faith,</hi> that Soule loves that light it
hath, and bleſſeth God for it, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of it a great mercie; and therefore
ſeekes by all meanes to maintaine and
encreaſe it, and joynes ſide with it all
he can.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> where there is onely a
<hi>Naturall Conſcience,</hi> ſuch a one is very
hardly brought to ſuffer any thing; he
ſeekes to put off the Truth as much as
he can, that he might not be convinced
by it; there muſt be wonderfull cleare
evidence, that he can by no meanes
ſhift off, or elſe he will never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced;
he will part with nothing,
unleſſe it be wrung from him with
great ſtrength, of undeniable evidence
of the Truth; it muſt ſo ſhine upon his
face, as that he cannot ſhut his eyes
againſt it: but where there is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of <hi>Faith,</hi> it is not ſo, the Soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:101279:128"/>
willing and readie to yeeld up all it
is, or hath, to God; it is as willing to
entertaine ſuffering Truths as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Pſal. 18. 44. As ſoone as they heare
of me, they ſhall obey me.</hi> It is a hard
thing to convince a man of a ſuffering
Truth, if he hath not a ſuffering heart:
Many men will ſay, if they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that ſuch a thing were a Truth,
that if it were a dutie that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of them, they would yeeld unto
it, whatſoever became of them; but
yet they doe not ſee it to be ſo: but
the deceit of their hearts lies here, that
they knowing they dare not oppoſe it,
if they were convinced, and that it
will bring upon them much trouble, if
they be forced to yeeld to it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are unwilling to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
they ſhut their eyes againſt the
light: arguments of leſſe ſtrength can
prevaile to convince them in other
things, but here ſtrong light will not
doe it, becauſe they fore-ſee the ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
conſequences that will follow: but
where there is a ſuffering heart, a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe
to ſacrifice all for the leaſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:101279:128"/>
Truth,<note place="margin">Quando bona audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entis &amp; grata mens est, facile aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentitur ſermonibus veritatis, Chryſoſt. Hom. 26. in Mat.</note> how ſoone, how eaſily is ſuch
a one convinced of any Truth? When
the mind of the hearer is good, it
eaſily aſſents to the word of Truth,
ſayes <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> a <hi>Naturall Conſcience</hi> does
not prize an opportunitie of ſuffering,
ſo as thoſe doe who have a Principle
of <hi>Faith;</hi> they goe to it as a great
mercie, they account it as a great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
that God calls them forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and gives them opportunitie for the
teſtifying of their love to his Name,
and the expreſſing the worke of their
Grace for his prayſe; accounting of it
the higheſt improvement that may be,
to lay downe all at Gods feet in a way
of ſelfe-denyall: the other may ſuffer
the ſame thing, but he lookes upon his
ſufferings as a great part of his miſerie,
and at the way of Gods providence,
bringing of him thereunto, as a great
evill unto him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> a <hi>Naturall Conſcience</hi> reſts
in the thing done, in the very worke of
enduring troubles; there doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
the Grace of God in the manner
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:101279:129"/>
of his ſufferings, in the carriage of his
Soule in them; there doth not appeare
the Glory of God, in the enabling of
him to goe through them; neither is
he much ſollicitous about that, but
onely how he may beare them, and get
thorow them: but <hi>Faith</hi> ſets on worke
all the Graces of Gods Spirit, by
which the ſufferings of one truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
are much beautified, his Spirit is
exceedingly ſavourie in them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.
17. It is ſaid, <hi>God is the glory of the
ſtrength of his ſervants:</hi> Thou art the
glory of their ſtrength. Now this was
in a time of great trouble to the
Church, as appeares <hi>Verſe</hi> 38. and ſo
forward: <hi>But thou haſt caſt off, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred,
thou haſt beene wroth with thine
anointed; thou haſt made void the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of thy ſervant, thou haſt prophaned
his Crowne, by caſting it to the ground;
thou haſt broken downe all his hedges,
all that paſse by the way ſpoyle him, he
is a reproach to his neighbours, &amp;c.</hi> Yet
even at this time, God gives ſuch
ſtrength to his people, as that his
Glory ſhines in it: Therefore ſurely
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:101279:129"/>
it is more then can be by any naturall
worke.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6.</note> a <hi>naturall conſcience</hi> may put
a man upon the way of ſelf-denyall, but
ſuch a one accounts the wayes of God
hard wayes, becauſe of the troubles he
meets withall in them, hee is brought
out of love with Gods wayes, and hee
is weary of them, he is even ſorry that
he came into them, and could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to with-draw himſelfe from them,
if hee knew how to doe it; but a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever</hi>
ſuffering in the wayes of God,
hee ſtill likes well of them, hee ſpeakes
good of them, his heart cleaves cloſe
unto them: Sufferings are eſteemed
the better, becauſe they are in the
wayes of God, and the wayes of
God are not eſteemed the worſe,
becauſe they are in the wayes of
Suffering, his Suffering confirmes
him in them; a crucified Chriſt,
and perſecuted godlineſſe, are very
lovely in his eyes: <hi>Cant. 1. 13. A bundle
of Myrrh is my beloved unto me, hee ſhall
lye all night betweene my breſts; Myrrh</hi>

as <hi>Myrrh,</hi> yet he ſhall lye between my
breſts, next to my heart, as moſt lovely
and delightfull to me: where there is
true godlineſſe, ſuch a one whatſoever
he meets withall in Gods wayes, hee
never opens his mouth againe to ſpeake
againſt them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 63. and <hi>Pſal.</hi>
44. 17, 18, 19, 20, &amp;c. <hi>All this is
come upon us, yet have we not forgotten
thee, neither have we dealt falſely in thy

neither have our ſteps declined from thy
way, though thou hast ſore broken us in
the place of Dragons, and covered us with
the ſhadow of death, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.
from the 38. verſe to the 52. we read of
<hi>Ethan</hi> making a moſt lamentable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
for the miſeries of the Church,
and yet he concludes, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord
for evermore:</hi> and this not formally, or
ſlightly, but earneſtly with much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and therefore he addes <hi>Amen,</hi>
and doubles it, <hi>Amen, Amen:</hi> as if
he ſhould ſay, let the troubles of the
Church bee what they will, yet God
and his wayes ſhall be for ever bleſſed,
in mine eyes, in my heart.</p>

As he doth not aime at the glory

                  <hi>naturall conſcience</hi> may
put a man upon denying of the world,

he is ſtill the more ready, and the more
fit to doe further ſervice; ſo, the more
he ſuffers for God, the more ready hee
is to ſuffer further.</p>
               <p>Wee ſee by all this what great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
there is in mans heart, even there
where there is the leaſt ſuſpition of it;
wee often thinke our hearts may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us in doing, but we doe not feare
our hearts in ſuffering; let us learne
now, that deceit lyes cloſer then wee
thought of, we had need looke well to
our principle in ſuffering, or elſe wee
loſe the honour of it. That place is
obſervable, <hi>Mat. 19. 27. 30. Peter</hi> tells
Chriſt, <hi>that hee and the reſt of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
were content to forſake all for him:</hi>
Well, ſayes Chriſt, <hi>But many that are
first,</hi> who ſuffer much for mee, yet if
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:101279:132"/>
they looke not well to their principle,
if there bee mixture, and nature and
ſelfe appeare in their ſufferings, <hi>they
ſhall be last;</hi> others who ſuffer not ſo
much ſhall be preferred before them;
and <hi>cap.</hi> 20. 16. he give the reaſon <hi>why
many who are firſt,</hi> who are very forward,
<hi>ſhall be laſt,</hi> becauſe <hi>many are called, but
few are choſen,</hi> many are called to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
hard things for God, but few are
choſen, few ſuffer ſo, as to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as the choſen ones of the Lord.
<hi>Faith</hi> puts an excellencie upon what
wee receive, upon what we doe, and
upon what we ſuffer; that which wee
have by <hi>Faith,</hi> is better then that wee
have any other way; and that which
we doe or ſuffer by <hi>faith,</hi> is better then
that which is done or ſuffered any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. The Scripture makes it a
great matter that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould
have a childe when hee was a hundred
yeeres old; why <hi>Terah</hi> his Father was
a 130. when he begat <hi>Abraham,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Abraham</hi> had his child by <hi>faith,</hi>
therefore it was a great matter: And
ſo in all other things that wee have,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:101279:132"/>
doe, or ſuffer, if they be by <hi>Faith,</hi> they
are great things.</p>

that can befall you, will be but the
exerciſe of your <hi>faith,</hi> to make it more
bright and ſhining, and <hi>the tryall of your
faith, which is a moſt precious things,</hi> 1 Pet.
1. 7. The tryall of your <hi>faith,</hi> ſayes the
Apoſtle, is more precious then gold
that periſheth, although it be tryed
with fire; and this <hi>tryall</hi> will be found
to your praiſe, and honour, and glory at
the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt. Obſerve
how the Apoſtle heapes up words,
<hi>praiſe, honour,</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> for the ſetting
out what a bleſſed thing the very <hi>tryall
of our faith</hi> is, ſhewing how all the
troubles of the Saints, conſidering
what a principle they have to carry
them through, are a greater good unto
them, then if they met with none;
with what confidence, and courage,
may a man reſiſt any oppoſition, when
he knowes before-hand, that hee hath
that which which will quell it, and that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:101279:133"/>
all oppoſition is but for the exerciſe
and tryall of his ſtrength; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
ſhall be to his prayſe, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and glory. Although you thinke
you have no ſtrength, to encounter
with ſuch great tryals as you are like
to meet withall, yet labour to quiet
your hearts in the exerciſe of Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
that wil bring in ſtrength enough:
whatſoever you thinke would ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
you, you ſhall finde it all in the
exerciſe of Faith. That place is very
obſervable, <hi>Iſay 30. 7. Your ſtrength is
to ſit ſtill:</hi> They thought their ſtrength
had beene in the helpe of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as if
nothing could helpe them but <hi>Egypt:</hi>
Nay, ſaith God, if you would qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
reſt your ſpirits in me, you ſhould
have an <hi>Egypt:</hi> Whatſoever ſtrength
you expect from <hi>Egypt,</hi> you ſhall have
it here: For the word tranſlated
<hi>ſtrength,</hi> is the ſame that is uſed in

ſuccour you might thinke to have
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:101279:134"/>
that way, you ſhall have it this way.
Oh, that we could thus quiet our hearts
in the exerciſe of our Faith, in all our
feares.</p>
               <p>This were comfort indeed,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> if wee
were ſure our <hi>Faith</hi> were right, and
ſuch as would carry us through: But
how ſhall we know that?</p>
               <p>I anſwer:<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> Firſt, if your <hi>Faith</hi> be
ſuch as carryes your Soules to God,
as an univerſall good, ſo as you can
ſatisfie your ſelves in Him alone; then
it is this precious Faith that will doe
this, that we ſpeake of.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> if your <hi>Faith</hi> workes a
ſanctified uſe of your proſperitie; if
your Faith can carry you through the
temptations of proſperitie, it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
carry you through the tryals
of adverſitie; if Faith can keepe you
from ſwelling in proſperitie, it will
keepe you from breaking in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially,<note place="margin">3.</note> in the third place, if
your Faith can carry you through ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
difficulties, it will be much
more able to carry you through all
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:101279:134"/>
outward troubles: I will inſtance in
five ſpirituall difficulties.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> if it can enable you to venture
your Soule and eternall eſtate upon
the free Grace of God,<note place="margin">How to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our <hi>Faith</hi> be right, and ſuch as wil carry us through all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> in the ſight and
ſenſe of all your owne unworthineſſe.
This, many will thinke, is not ſo hard a
matter; but certainely, there is more
difficultie in this worke of Faith, then
in enabling to beare all the miſeries of
the world: To doe this, when the
Soule underſtands throughly what
the meaning of ſinne is, what that
breach is, that it hath made betweene
God and it ſelfe; when the Soule is
truly burdened with it, when it hath
the ſight of Gods infinite holineſſe,
and knowes what the conſequence of
an eternall eſtate meanes, and yet for
me to venture all, ſo as, <hi>I am loſt for
ever, if I miſcarrie here,</hi> and that <hi>when
I have nothing to commend me to God,</hi>
when he can ſee no good in me, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but that which his Soule loathes
and abhorres; ſurely, now to venture
upon the free Grace of God, is a moſt
glorious worke of Faith: And that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:101279:135"/>
Faith that can doe this, we need not
feare, but it will carry through all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
troubles.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> if your <hi>Faith</hi> can keepe
you in love to holy duties, although
you find nothing come in by them:
you <hi>pray,</hi> you <hi>heare,</hi> you <hi>reade,</hi> you
receive <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and yet you finde
your hearts as hard, and your corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as ſtrong as ever; yet if ſtill you
can continue, not onely the practice of
holy duties, but <hi>love</hi> unto them, this is
a great worke of Faith.</p>
               <p>The three latter, are <hi>Luthers</hi> three
difficulties of Faith,<note place="margin">1. Credere impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia rationi</note> namely, firſt, <hi>To

                  <note place="margin">2. Sperare dilata.</note>
and thirdly, <hi>To love God, when

               <p>LAſtly, if Faith be the Grace that<note place="margin">Vſe 6.</note>
carryes through all, then it is our
wiſedome, to labour what wee can, to
maintaine and ſtrengthen our Faith:
Let us looke eſpecially to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

<hi>Dalilah,</hi> let not any carnall content get
away, no, nor in the leaſt degree abate
our ſtrength; let us be ſure we looke
to our Shield, that that be ſafe and
ſound. As that Heathen <hi>Epaminondas,</hi>
being dangerouſly wounded with a
Speare, ſo that hee ſunke downe as
one dead; but after comming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
hee asked if his Target were

ſo ſhould ours be about <hi>the Shield</hi> of

be neglected. Eſpecially therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:101279:136"/>
to ſtrengthen your Faith in theſe
three things.</p>
               <p>The firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> is the principall and
ground of all, namely, The <hi>aſſurance</hi>
of your intereſt <hi>in the Covenant of
Grace,</hi> that you are received by God
into that free, rich, glorious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of life in Chriſt; That now
you are not to ſtand or fall, by what
is in your ſelves, or what comes from
you, but by the perfect righteouſneſſe
of that bleſſed Mediator, who hath
undertaken your Cauſe with God:
doubts and fears, about this, doe
much weaken the ſpirits of men, when
troubles come upon them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> in the <hi>aſſurance of Gods
fatherly love unto, and care over you,</hi>
in the ſoreſt and hardeſt afflictions
that can befall you. As it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of much ignorance, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
ones ſelfe that God loves one,
becauſe of preſent proſperitie; ſo it
is exceeding weakeneſſe, to call Gods
love in queſtion, upon the feeling the
ſmart of affliction, to thinke that none
of Gods people are afflicted in ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:101279:136"/>
kinde as I am; If it were in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind, it were not ſo much, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus, I am afraid that God never
loved mee, and that he hath now quite
forſaken mee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> in the <hi>aſſurance of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
iſſue of all,</hi> that all will be peace and
comfort at the laſt: if <hi>Faith</hi> be ſtrong
in theſe, it will be able to encounter
with all aſſaults whatſoever: this
ſtrengthening of our Faith muſt be,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> by much meditation in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace, the rich promiſes, and
glorious manifeſtations of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in his Word, that ſo the ſoule may
be acquainted with the promiſes, and
have alwayes a word at hand to relieve
it ſelfe withall.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> by keeping conſcience
cleare, that it may ſpeake peace, and
encourage us, that it may not upbraid
us, that it may not caſt feares into us,
that it may not caſt camps of ſpirit
within us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> take heed of liſtening to the
reaſonings of fleſh and blood, venture
we our ſelves wholly upon the word;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:101279:137"/>
if wee have that, never argue the cauſe
any further. Wee read of Saint <hi>Paul,
Gal.</hi> 1. 16. that he dared not to conſult
with fleſh and blood, after Chriſt was
once revealed in him, if he had, he had
never beene able to deny himſelfe, as
hee did: carnall reaſonings are great
enemies to Faith, they are the ſtrong
holds of Satan, which muſt be batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
downe: <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 5. Truſt in the
Lord with all thy heart, and leave not
unto thine owne underſtanding. There
we ſee that leaning to ones owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and truſting in God, are
oppoſed one to another.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> keepe Faith in continuall
exerciſe upon all occaſions; looke up
to God in the ſtrength of a promiſe,
for aſſiſtance in all things, for ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for bleſſing every thing unto you;
live by <hi>Faith</hi> in whatſoever you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
or doe, that ſo when greater try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
come, <hi>faith</hi> may be in a readineſſe,
being alwayes kept active and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> labour much to keepe up
your converſe with God, in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:101279:137"/>
in all holy duties, that you
may be exerciſed in them with life and
power, that there being a holy ſweet
familiarity between God and the ſoule,
it may be more able freely, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and confidently to repaire unto
him in times of trouble, and exerciſe
its Faith upon him, as that God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
whom and the ſoule, there is
daily a ſweet intercourſe, God letting
himſelfe out daily in his love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to the ſoule, and the ſoules wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up its ſelfe, and inlarging it ſelfe in
love, and delight, and praiſe to God
againe.</p>
               <p>And when ſufferings come, then ſtir
up, and put forth the grace of <hi>Faith</hi>
in the exerciſe of it, looke up to God
for ſtrength and aſſiſtance,<note place="margin">Qui mihi oneris eſt author, ipſe fiat admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrationis adjutor dabit vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem qui contulit dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</note> commit
your ſelfe and cauſe wholly to him;
plead the promiſe, plead your call that
hee hath called you to this; plead the
cauſe that it is his. Maſter <hi>Tindall</hi> in a
Letter of his to Maſter <hi>Frith,</hi> who was
then in priſon, hath foure expreſſions
of the worke of <hi>Faith</hi> in time of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
If you <hi>give your ſelfe, caſt your
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:101279:138"/>
ſelfe, yield</hi> your ſelfe, <hi>commit</hi> your ſelfe
wholly and onely to your loving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then ſhall his power bee in you,
and make you ſtrong, hee ſhall ſet out
his truth by you wonderfully, and work
for you above all your heart can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
               <p>And obſerve this rule, labour to
ſtrengthen and exerciſe your Faith,
<hi>before</hi> your heart bee too deepely
affected with your affliction. Wee
uſually have our firſt and chiefeſt
thoughts upon our Troubles, and
ſpend the ſtrength of our ſpirits in
poring upon them, and tyre our ſelves
in the workings of our unbeleeving
diſcontented ſpirits, giving libertie
to the reaſonings of our hearts, ſo
that wee are ſunke before any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
can come to us, wee are not
able to raiſe up our ſelves, to looke
at a promiſe: But our way ſhould be,
whatſoever our condition is, firſt,
to endeavour to ſtrengthen our Faith,
and then to make our moane to
God.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Ethan, Pſal.</hi> 89. This <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:101279:138"/>
1 King.</hi> 4. is mentioned as one of
the wiſeſt men upon the earth, and
hee ſhewes his wiſedome much in
this, that in a time of the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of the Church, hee being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of it, and about to make his
complaint to God of it, yet hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
with raiſing his and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Faith, in the mercy, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
and power of God, before
hee will make any mention of their
calamities; hee doth not begin to
make his moane for the miſeries of
the Church till the thirty eighth verſe,
but all before is nothing but Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to raiſe and ſtrengthen <hi>Faith,</hi>
and to put that forth in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of it.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Moſes, Pſalme</hi> 90. being
about to complaine of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
of Gods people, that they
were conſumed by his anger, and
troubled by his wrath, yet begins
with the acknowledging of Gods
goodneſſe, with Arguments to
ſtrengthen Faith. <hi>Lord thou haſt been
our dwelling place, in all generations,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:101279:139"/>
from everlaſting to everlaſting, thou art
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus <hi>David, Pſalme</hi> 37. 1.
before hee beginnes his complaint,
hee layes downe this concluſion:
<hi>Truely God is good to Iſrael, even
to ſuch as are of a cleane
heart.</hi>
