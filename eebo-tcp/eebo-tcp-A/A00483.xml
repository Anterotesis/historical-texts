            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and conſolation, in al our affayres and neceſſities, two thinges, concerning prayer, are ſpecially to be learned.

The ſecond is, in what wiſe we ſhuld make our prayer, in ſuche ſorte as it may be acceptably hearde, and graciouſly graunted of our heauenly father.</p>
            <p>¶ As for the firſt, we ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to aſke of our heauenly father, his holy and bleſſid ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, godly wiſedome, faith, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and to feare and dreade him, and that his holy name in al thingis, and euery where tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough al the hole world may be glorified, that his kyngedome

            <p>We ought to pray, that his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wyl may be fulfylled here in this world emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges vs his mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tall creatures, as it is of his immortall angels, and of al the holy company of the heauenly ſpirites.

bothe many and great, wherby we offende againſte his infinite goodnes, as we do forgiue the offences of them that offend vs. whiche, howe great ſo euer they appere vnto vs, yet in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the offences that we do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt god, they be bothe ſmall and fewe. We muſte pray, that oure heauenly father ſuffre vs not to be ledde into temptation, for without his continuall aide and protection, we are but weke and ſoone ouerthrowen. Our goſtely ennemy is ſtronge, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, fierſe, ſubtyll, and exceding cruell. And therfore we muſte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually pray, with all inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that in al his aſſaultes we may be deliuered by the mighty ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of our heauenly father, from al

Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>☞ <hi>AND</hi> here ſpecially let vs pray for our moſte dere and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne lorde the Kynges ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, who dothe not onely ſtudy and care dayly and hourely for our proſperitie and wealth, but alſo ſpareth not, to ſpende his ſubſtance and treaſure, yea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye at all tymes to endaunger hym ſelf for the tender loue and fatherly zeale, that he bereth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde this his realme, and the ſubiectes of the ſame. Who at this preſent tyme hath taken v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hym the great and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous affayres of warre. Lette vs praye, that it may pleaſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghty god, lorde of hoſtes, in whoſe handes is onely wealthe and victorie, mercifully to aſſyſt
<pb facs="tcp:10017:7"/>
him, ſending his holy angell, to be his ſuccour, keper, &amp; defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all his aduerſaries, and from all euyls. Let vs pray for our bretherne, that bende them ſelfes to batail for goddis cauſe and our defence, that god maye grant them proſperous ſucceſſe, to our comfort, and the increaſe of his glory. Let vs praye for our ſelfes that remain at home, that almyghty god defende vs from ſynne, ſickenes, derth, and all other aduerſyties of bodye and ſoule.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde thynge to be ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, concernynge praier, is to know, howe we ſhal make true prayer, ſo that it may be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſely harde, and mercyfully graunted of oure heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb facs="tcp:10017:7"/>
Fyrſt of al we muſt, vpon conſideration of our heauenly fathers mercy and goodnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, and of his euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng trueth, and free promyſe made vnto vs in his owne holy worde, conceyue a full affiance hoope and truſt: and that with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out waueryng or doubtfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtyng, eyther in his trueth, his goodnes, or in his almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie power, certainely aſſuring our ſelfe, that both of his omni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>potencie, he may do what ſoeuer ſhall pleaſe his goodnes, and alſo for his infinite goodnes, and fatherlye affection towarde vs, that he woll both here and graunt al our lauful and godly requeſtes, after that meaſure, ſort, and degree, as he of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb facs="tcp:10017:8"/>
and incomprehenſible wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome knoweth the thynge to be mooſt mete, mooſt conuenient, and behofeful both for his own glorye and honour, and for the profit, behoufe, and commoditie of vs his children.</p>
            <p>Furthermore alſo it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily requyred to that, that our prayer may be acceptable vnto our heuenly father, to haue cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and brotherly loue betwixt neighbour and neighbour, and towarde all our euen chriſten. So <hi>CHRISTE</hi> him ſelfe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, ſayinge, whan you ſtande to praye, forgyue, if you haue any dyſpleaſure agaynſte any perſonne: that your father, whiche is in heauen, maye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue you. It is a true ſaying
<pb facs="tcp:10017:8"/>
that ſaint Auguſtine ſayeth: There is no good fruicte, no good deede, no good woorke, whiche ſpringeth not out of the roote of charitie. And ſaincte Paule teacheth plainely, that where as charitie lacketh, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng can auayle vs.</p>
            <p>And moreouer we muſt in our prayer, be ware of vayne glory and prayſe of man, outwardly ſhewing a great pretence of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes, and being vayne of true godlynes inwardly, onely to haue the commendation of men before the world. for if we ſo do, we ſhall loſe the reward and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of our prayer, as our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>CHRIST</hi> ſaieth his owne ſelfe. We muſt take hede alſo, that we thincke not the vertue
<pb facs="tcp:10017:9"/>
of prayer, to conſiſte in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of many wordes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faythe and godly deuotion, thynckyng as the heathen doth, that for our many wordes or moche ſpeking, we ſhalbe herde of our heauenly father. Who ſo euer doth thinke ſo, he ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue him ſelfe. for god doth not regarde neither the ſwete ſound of our voice, nor the great num ber of our woordes, but the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt feruentnes and true fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deuotion of our hartes. Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally we muſte beware in our praier of that common peſtilent infection, and venemefull poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all good prayer, that is to ſay, when our mouthe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and our hartes praye not. Of the whiche the prophete E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaie
<pb facs="tcp:10017:9"/>
complayneth ſore. And our ſauyour in ſaynte Mathewes goſpel rebuketh the phariſees, for the ſame, ſaying thus: O hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, Eſaie the prophet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phected well vppon you, when he ſayde thus: This people dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth nighe me with theyr lyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, but their hartes are farre from me, that is to ſaye, they ſpeake with their tongue and lippes, the wordes of praier, but in theyr harte, they mynde no thyng leſſe then they ſpeake, as that the goodnes of the prayer ſtode in the outwarde ſpeking onely of the woorde, and not in the inwarde, true and faythfull requeſt of the harte.
