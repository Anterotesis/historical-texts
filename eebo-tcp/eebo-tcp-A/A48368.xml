            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PAROCHIAL QUERIES
In Order to
A Geographical Dictionary, A Natural History, &amp;c. of Wales.</head>
            <byline>By the Undertaker <hi>E. L.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>HAVING Publish'd some Proposals towards a Survey of <hi>Wales,</hi> and met with
sufficient Encouragement from the Gentry of that Country, and several others,
Lovers of such Studies; to enable me (with God's Permission) to Undertake it:
I thought it necessary for the easier and more effectual Performance of so tedious
a Task, to Print the following <hi>Queries;</hi> having good Grounds to hope the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Clergy (since they are pleas'd to afford me so Generous an Allowance
towards it) will also readily contribute their Assistance, as to Information; and
the Use of their Manuscripts, Coyns, and other Monuments of Antiquity: The Design being so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
difficult without such Helps, and so easily improvable thereby. Nor would I have any
imagine, that by Publishing these <hi>Queries,</hi> I design to spare my self the least Labour of Travelling the
Country, but on the contrary be assured, I shall either come my self, or send one of my Assistants
into each Parish throughout <hi>Wales,</hi> and all those in <hi>Shropshire</hi> and <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> where the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
and the Ancient Names of Places are still retain'd: And that with all the Speed, so particular
a Survey will admit of. My Request therefore to such as are desirous of Promoting the Work,
is, That after each <hi>Query,</hi> they would please to write on the blank Paper, (or elsewhere if room be
wanting) their Reports; confining themselves, unless the Subject shall require otherwise, to that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
only where they inhabit; and distinguishing always betwixt Matter of Fact, Conjecture, and
Tradition. Nor will any, I hope, omit such Informations as shall occur to their Thoughts, upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
they can be of little use to the Undertaker, or the Publick, or because they have not leisure
to write down their Observations so regularly as they desire: Seeing that what we sometimes judge
insignificant, may afterwards upon some Application unthought of, appear very useful; and that a
regular and compleat Account of Things is not here so much expected, as short Memorials, and
some Directions in order to a further <hi>Enquiry.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Queries in order to the Geography, and

Sea-Spiders; Starres, Buttons, Sponges; Urticae, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyae
Holothuria,</hi> &amp;c. Or have made any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
extraordinary on <hi>Land-Insects?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIX. Information is desired from those who
have been most conversant in Fishing; what sorts
of <hi>Fish</hi> their Waters afford, and of these which
are the Rarest, or haunt those Places most Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
What Variety of Colours and Shape they
have observ'd in the same Species? What Baits
used for each, and when in Season? What sorts are
Solitary, and which keep together in Shoals?
What they have observ'd as to their Feeding,
Spawning, and Change of Names according to
Age; and by what Tokens they know such, to be
the same Species? Also the <hi>Iaws,</hi> and some of the
<hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Rarest (for which some Gratuity
shall be allow'd the Fishermen) are desired; in
order to compare them with the <hi>Fossil Bones</hi>
above-mention'd.</p>
               <p>XXX. By what is proposed of <hi>Insects</hi> and <hi>Fish;</hi>
the Reader will judge what sort of Information
will be acceptable, relating to <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Quadrupeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXI. Who in each Country is best skill'd in
the <hi>Welsh</hi> Names of <hi>Birds, Fish, Insects, Plants,
Stones;</hi> or any other Natural Bodies?</p>
               <p>Having thus propounded what <hi>Queries</hi> occur to my Thoughts; nothing remains, but that I own to
the Publick, that in case this Paper meets with a kind Reception (as from this last Summer's Travels,
I have great Hopes it may) if the Undertaking be ill perform'd, 'twill be wholly my own Fault; the
Gentry of the Country having in all Respects done more than their Part, and afforded such an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
towards it, as might sufficiently requite the Labours of a Person far better Qualified
for such a <hi>Design:</hi> But of this, a particular Account (as is necessary) shall be given hereafter. So I
shall only add here; that as to these <hi>Queries,</hi> besides <hi>Wales,</hi> I intreat the favourable Assistance of the
Gentry and Clergy in those other Countries mention'd in the former Proposals: And that in all Places,
they who are dispos'd to further the Design, would please to communicate this Paper where they
think fit, amongst their Neighbours; interpreting some <hi>Queries</hi> to those of the Vulgar, whom they
judge Men of Veracity, and capable of giving any the least Information towards it, that may be
pertinent and instructive.</p>
               <p>We judge Mr. <hi>Lhwyd</hi> Qualified for this Undertaking; and that he cannot want proper Materials towards
it, if (as an Addition to his own Industry) he receives such Answers to those <hi>Queries,</hi> as can be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
return'd from each <hi>Parish.</hi>
