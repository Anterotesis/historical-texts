            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <note rend="inter">Preface.</note> SHewing the reaſonableneſs of any Man's changing his Religion upon proper Motives, and of what nature they are, and wherein the ſcandal of ſuch a change is truly given. An enquiry is then made into the reaſons of this Gentleman's Proceedings, and thoſe are obſerved to be chiefly two, <hi>viz.</hi> That he might become more truly in the Communion of the Catholick Church, and that he might be more Pure and Orthodox in his Faith and Worſhip.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>1.</hi> The firſt of theſe Propoſals i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Catholick Church upon account either of its Authority or Comprehenſion. The firſt is proved in that the Catholick Church was not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by our Saviour under a Monarchical, but an Ariſtocratical Government; and this is ſhewn farther from the election and practice of the twelve Apoſtles. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is but a particular Church is alſo ſhewn from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. An Objection relating to St. <hi>Peter</hi> is anſwered. The practice of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and the Biſhops their Succeſſours ſhews that their Government was in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Several reaſons are urged farther, to prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Catholick Church; and that the Church of <hi>England</hi> as a particular Church hath equal right and as good a claim as ſhe to all thoſe Promiſes which are made unto the Church by our Bleſſed Saviour in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>2.</hi> This is further ſhewn to have been the opinions even of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in former Ages, and proved from her Decrees and Practice in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſm. A Compariſon is alſo made between the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> on this pretence, and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the one, applyed <hi>in terminis</hi> unto the other.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>3.</hi> A Compariſon is alſo made between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Church of <hi>England</hi> as to terms of Communion, and thereby it is ſhewn that (according to his notion of Catholick) he that lives in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> lives more in the Communion of the Catholick Church, than any Member of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. <hi>4.</hi> A further Compariſon is made between the Churches as to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of their Doctrin, and thereby it is ſhewn that the Catholick Faith is much more truly profeſt in the Church of <hi>England</hi> than in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58237:2"/>
§. <hi>5.</hi> It is alſo ſhewn that in point of Doctrin the Church of <hi>England</hi> is more antient than the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that the old Religion appears evidently to be ſtill profeſt there, and that no new Doctrin was brought in, but rather aboliſht by the Reformation.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>6.</hi> The ſecond Motive is enquired into and examined, and a brief Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon in this point is made between the Churches; ſhewing how the one is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Scriptures, and is conſonant to the Law of God, and the Principles of Reaſon, while the other hath no ground but a looſe Tradition, and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts them, both in her Doctrin, and Religious Practice.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>7.</hi> The Queſtion is more particularly ſtated in that Doctrin and Practice that relates unto the Sacrament. With a brief Obſervation of the unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the one, and the danger of the other, as they now ſtand in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. <hi>8.</hi> The Doctrin of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Point is laid down, and two obſervations are made upon it: Firſt, That our Saviour's words at the Inſtitution of the Sacrament are not to be underſtood in a literal ſenſe, as ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth. Secondly, That if they were, yet neither can her Doctrin be inferred from them, nor her Practice be juſtified by them.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>9.</hi> The firſt of theſe is proved, <hi>1</hi>ſt From the nature of the thing, in that it contradicts our Senſes, which are ſhewn to be proper Judges in this Caſe, as well as any other. The impoſition alſo of the Schoolmen is detected, in treating on this ſubject in improper terms; and farther it is alſo ſhewn that in this ſenſe they cannot agree with the concomitant expreſſions as well before as after the Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>10.</hi> The ſame thing is proved <hi>2dly.</hi> From the deſign of the Inſtitution, which is ſhewn and explained, and then compared with the Paſsover, and other Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and ſo both the Practice and the Benefits thereof are illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, by ſhewing what they did, and what they expected.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>11.</hi> It is proved alſo <hi>3dly,</hi> From the occaſion of that expreſſion, which is ſhewn to be a parallel Phraſe conſtantly in uſe among the <hi>Jews</hi> at the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Paſsover, and ſo by the evident meaning of their words, the ſenſe of our Saviour is fully explained.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>12.</hi> The Doctrin of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this Point is ſhewn to agree with that of the Fathers, and the ancient Doctrin of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58237:3"/>
her ſelf. This is ſhewn to be ſtill evident in the Roman <hi>Miſſal,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> although it hath been alter'd ſince the days of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> to make it more conformable to the preſent Doctrin.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>13.</hi> The former Obſervation is proved <hi>4thly,</hi> From our Saviour's own Declaration, <hi>John vi.</hi> Where he tells his Diſciples that he is ſpiritually to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; and therefore as is further obſerved, not only St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but even the aforeſaid <hi>Miſſal</hi> calleth the Sacrament Bread after its Conſecration.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>14.</hi> Another Compariſon is made between the Doctrin of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as to the conſequences of them, and thereby ſhewn that in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Men hazard their Salvation on the truth of an Opinion that may be falſe, and more than probably is ſo; for none, not the leaſt advantage if it ſhould be true.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>15.</hi> The other Obſervation alſo is propounded, and therein it is ſhewn that our Saviour's words in the literal ſenſe can only reſpect his Body, and that too as it was dead, and offer'd up to God in Sacrifice. And ſeveral Reaſons are offered thence to ſhew, that this is not a proper Object for Divine Worſhip, and therefore obſerved that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to juſtifie their Practice, do ſtrein the words abundantly beyond all that they can bear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reaſon or Authority for it.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>16.</hi> Another danger is obſerved even in going to Maſs, as it is in the general Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in that many are always preſent whenever the Sacrament is Adminiſtred, who are not in a fit ſtate to be Partakers of it; and this is ſhewn from Scripture, as well as the Practice of the Primitive Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>17.</hi> Some other Particulars of the like nature are propoſed, and briefly toucht to ſhew the further evidence of the Propoſition diſcuſt: And ſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is made with an Exhortation to return.</p>

            <p>AS every Man's Salvation is his Principal Concern, and ought to be the chief end of all his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, ſo no Action whatſoever can be juſtly lyable to Cenſure, that is either founded on that motive, or even tends to that deſign. But it is very unreaſonable to find fault with him, that ſhall change his Sentiments of Religion, and conſequently make an open Profeſſion of it; provided that he acts directly upon truly Chriſtian Motives, according to a real apprehenſion of the Truth, and a ſerious Conviction of the Conſcience. The only thing that in this Caſe is liable to Cenſure, being a baſe compliance with the thoughts of other Men, or a change of the True Religion upon falſe inducements; ſince neither God nor Man can be ſecure of his Fidelity, whom Intereſt can bribe to act againſt his Conſcience.</p>
            <p>It is therefore no ſmall Satisfaction unto me, and I believe alſo to the reſt of all your Friends, that being well acquainted with your former Converſation, we believe your ſincerity in all that you have done, and that no Temporal advantage (the too common ſpur of mean and fickle Spirits) could ever incline
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58237:4"/>
your thoughts to entertain a Notion, but as you were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of and confided in its Truth. So that either the want of a due Conſideration in reſpect of your Motives to believe, or ſome great miſtake in your Notion of Religion, and that as well in reſpect of the Faith which you deſerted, as of that which you embrace, have ever appeared to me as the reaſon of your Change; that you ſhould quit thoſe Principles wherein you were Bred, for ſuch as upon enquiry can never appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, either ſo Rational or ſo Chriſtian. As it is the duty of every Chriſtian therefore, to endeavour the ſatisfaction of his offended Brother, and to rectifie thoſe Errors that have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd him from the Faith, ſo I think my ſelf obliged, by the ſpecial tyes of Friendſhip, to be peculiarly concerned in your Reſtitution, and not only to diſcover to you, the Sophiſtry of thoſe Arguments that have impoſed upon you, but alſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain thoſe Truths, wherewith you ſeem unacquainted.</p>
            <p>For if the account be true, which I have had of your Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, your Motives to leave the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Embrace the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were theſe: A deſire to live more truly in the Communion of the Catholick Church; and to become more Orthodox in your Faith and Worſhip. If then I can make it evident that you were miſtaken in both theſe great Propoſals, and that a contrary event in both, is the ſure reſult of this your undertaking; It will be reaſonable to expect your Repentance for what you have done, and a Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that Mother whom you have forſaken.</p>
            <p>§. 1. How the firſt of theſe Propoſals could ever influence your Practice, is a very hard thing to be imagined; or why you ſhould phanſie now, that you are more in the Communion of the Catholick Church, than you were among us before your Change, is really a Conceit that I cannot find the ground of. Since the common impoſition by the Name of Catholick, muſt be too ſlight to move a Man of Learning: When the Name of <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> is but an uſurpt Title, that carries little leſs than a contradiction in the terms. I know indeed, there is an Error in the Notion of Church-Government, that is too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with many Chriſtians, and may poſſibly ſeduce them from the Truth of their Religion, to ſubmit unto thoſe Laws that can't oblige them: And that is, That the Government of the Catholick Church on Earth is Originally Monarchical, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58237:4"/>
conſequently that the Unity thereof conſiſts, in the due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of all the Members unto the Dominion of one Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Biſhop. So that no Man can be a Chriſtian, or in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Catholick Church, but he that will ſubmit unto the Pope's Authority. But in Truth it is fully evident from the Scriptures, from the Conſtitution of the Church, and from the practice of all Chriſtians in the Primitive Ages, that the Government of the Church on Earth, is Ariſtocratical, and that the Unity thereof, doth eminently conſiſt in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all its Members. So that every Perſon that makes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, and lives in the Communion of any particular Church or Society of Chriſtians, he is certainly in the Communion of the Catholick Church of Chriſt; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſincerity of his Profeſſion, he hath an undoubted Right unto all her Promiſes. For firſt the Scriptures do expreſly tell us <note n="1" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> x. 1. <hi>Mark</hi> iii. 14.</note>, that Chriſt Selected not one alone, but twelve Apoſtles, and <note n="2" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> x. 5. <hi>John</hi> xx. 21.</note>that he gave them all but one Commiſſion jointly, as well as made them by it all equal in Authority: That he was ſo far from conſtituting one as his Vicar upon Earth, with an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Dominion over all his Brethren, that he forbad ſuch Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition as diſagreeable with his Laws, and Ordained Humility to be their way of Government. <hi>Ye know</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Mat.</hi> XX. 25.) <hi>that the Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe dominion over them, and they that are great, exerciſe authority upon them. But it ſhall not be ſo among you: but whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your Miniſter: And whoſoever will be chief among you, let him be your Servant.</hi> Intimating clearly, that Eccleſiaſtical Authority is not like the Dominion of the <hi>Gentils,</hi> which was altogether managed in a Deſpotical way of Government: But as he himſelf was a pattern of Humility, and ſubmitted unto Death for the good of his People; ſo their joint Power ſhould conſiſt in ſerving others, without any pretence unto a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dominion. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> therefore moſt evidently refers the building of the Body of Chriſt (which is certainly the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church) not to any one, but unto the Apoſtles in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> iv. 11, 12. and although he was himſelf the laſt of all that Order, being, as he ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 8, 9. <hi>the leaſt of the Apoſtles, as one that was born out of due time.</hi> Yet he aſſures the <hi>Galatians, Galat.</hi> ii. 7. that in point of Authority in the Church of Chriſt, he was inferior unto no Man, in that the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58237:5"/>
Goſpel of the Uncircumciſion was committed unto him, as that of the Circumciſion was to <hi>Peter.</hi> And conſequently then, St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Principality (if he had any) was limited to the <hi>Jews</hi> that were Converted to the Faith, and not extended to the <hi>Gentils,</hi> over whom he ne're preſided. So that in this pretence of a Succeſſion from the Prince of the Apoſtles, the Pope can have no claim to a Juriſdiction in our Countries, except he can derive our Pedigree from thoſe of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</p>
            <p>But to manifeſt more clearly, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the whole Tree or Body of Chriſtians, no nor ſo much as the Root thereof, St. <hi>Paul</hi> not only reckons her among the Branches, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 17. but doth expreſly admoniſh her not to uſurp Dominion, as if he were ſuſpicious of her future great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <gap reason="foreign">

So that the Catholick Church of Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be confined to any Country, nor yet limited or reſtrained to one pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Governour: but it contains the whole Body or Society of Chriſtians, even all that are Baptized into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. And as every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church is at Unity in her ſelf, by the ſubmiſſion or agreement of all her Members under one Governour, ſo is the Unity of the Catholick Church
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58237:6"/>
maintained by the agreement or correſpondence of thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, whereby they do compoſe one Catholick Society. And therefore it is well obſerved, that there can be no more neceſſity of an Univerſal Biſhop to eſtabliſh and maintain this Unity in the Church, than there is of an Univerſal Monarch, to keep Peace and Commerce in the World: Since agreement among the Biſhops, is as ſufficient to the one, as correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence among Princes, is unto the other. And as there cannot poſſibly be more than one Catholick Church, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all Chriſtians, and conſequently all particular Churches whatſoever: So no one particular Society of Chriſtians (let its extent be never ſo great, or Members numerous) can juſtly lay a claim unto that Title. Nor on the other hand, can any particular Church ceaſe to be a Member of this Catholick, as long as ſhe continues Chriſtian, that is, as long as ſhe retaineth the Holy Scriptures as the word of God and expounds their meaning by Catholick Tradition. And conſequently then, no Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Chriſtians can be denied this priviledge or any other Right and Claim which the Catholick Church pretends to, until they do renounce the Faith, and ceaſe to be Chriſtians, and ſo are no longer Members of the Body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> therefore is the Catholick Church, upon account, either of its Authority or comprehenſion, is no more a Truth, than that a part is the whole; the terms being equally evident, and therefore as plain in the concluſion. And if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is but a particular Church, and ſo a Member only of the Catholick: The Church of <hi>England</hi> alſo muſt have an equal claim unto the ſame Right and Title, while no one can deny, that ſhe is Chriſtian: And therefore ſhe cannot loſe her Property in the Promiſes of her Saviour, till ſhe quits that Chriſtianity whereon they are founded. Whence it evidently follows, that all the Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are equally qualified for all Priviledges in Religion, and all Advantages in reſpect of the Catholick Church, which any Member of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can have a juſt claim or reaſon to pretend to.</p>

               </note>Baptiſm is not Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal nor Beneficial to Salvation, where the Perſon is excluded from the Society of Criſtians: Such Baptiſm then muſt be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, as doth make a Man a Chriſtian and a Member of that Society. If any Perſon therefore that is Baptized by one, whom you call Heretick, and with whoſe Church you will not Communicate, be notwithſtanding this ſo much a Chriſtian, as that he is to be Baptized no more; but if he ſhall change his Religion and become a Convert to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they will receive him into their Communion, but never permit him to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized again: I ſay then, this is a fair Conceſſion from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they Believe that he was a Chriſtian, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Member of the Body of Chriſt, before he was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of their Communion. For the Scripture tells <note n="12" place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> xv. 2.</note>us, that every Branch (although it is unfruitful, yet it) abideth in the Vine, until it is cut off, <hi>viz.</hi> by an Apoſtacie from the Faith; nor can any new Branch be grafted in, but by that Sacrament of Baptiſm, which Chriſt ordained for it. And therefore it is evident, that thoſe Antient Fathers did not believe that all Men were Apoſtates, who differed from them in Opinion as to Religion, but acknowledged that they were ſtill Chriſtians though Erroneous, and therefore would not repeat their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm which was compleat before, but received them Charitably by the Impoſition of Hands. Which is a ſufficient Evidence, that the Catholick Church of Chriſt is more extenſive than the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that a Chriſtian may be a Member of the one, although he is not actually in the Communion of the other.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is obſervable even at this day, that in the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> no Man is obliged by his Baptiſmal Vow to believe their own Articles or Conſtitutions, but only to Profeſs the Chriſtian Faith, as it is in common with all other Chriſtians; and which is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in a ſtate of Maturity, to qualifie any Perſon to be of their Communion. And conſequently then thoſe Articles are

not neceſſary in order to be a Chriſtian, although the proper Standard of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But a Man may be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Catholick Church, that is not preciſely one of her Communion. There is a Famous Act Recorded of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi>

But certainly, no Rational Man will ſay, that that Decree ſo made, was True and Authentick, or that all the Chriſtian Church was obliged to ſubmit unto it, and to be concluded by it, becauſe it was boldly delivered as a Truth, and confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted with over-great aſſurance, by a company of Men, that called themſelves a Council: But rather on the contary, ſuch an Act is to be derided, and the Cenſure laught at, as contrary to Reaſon and all Humane Conſtitutions, which leave all Perſons in their perfect Liberty, until by themſelves it is ſubmitted.

upon the People, as abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto their Salvation, which the Primitive Chriſtians for ſome hundreds of years, were never known to have thought, or heard of. So that (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own Notion) if to be Catholick, is to be of no Party nor Faction in Religious Matters, but a Chriſtian in full latitude and in reſpect of the Church in general, ſince every Member of the Univerſal Church muſt adjoin himſelf to ſome particular Society; he that is in the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> muſt appear to live in the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> more than any Member of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> And you were ſtrangely miſtaken in your Sentiments of Religion, when in this Notion of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> you quitted the one Communion, and Embrac'd the other.</p>
            <p>§. 4. But perhaps you will tell me, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is truly <hi>Catholick,</hi> not ſo much upon account of its extent or comprehenſion, or even the terms of Communion in her, as for her Antiquity and <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctrin; in that, ſhe appears the ſame from the days of the Apoſtles, while the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as it is now eſtabliſht, ſeems to take her date from the Reformation of her. If theſe ſhould be your thoughts, there are two particulars that deſerve to be conſidered by you. 1<hi>ſt.</hi> That no Article of Faith is maintained in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> as neceſſary to Salvation, but what is evidently found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Holy Scriptures <note n="18" place="margin">
                  <hi>Art.</hi> 6.</note>, and conſequently hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and received as ſuch, by every true Chriſtian from the Primitive Ages. So that you cannot inſtance any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that we hold as ſuch, to which the univerſal rule of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Doctrin, may not be eaſily and properly applyed, <hi>viz. Ab omnibus ubique &amp; ſemper fuit creditum.</hi> It was at all times, and in all places, and by all Men believed. Whereas every particular, wherein the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth differ from her, is alſo evidently of a later date; and it is eaſie to inſtance, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you require it, if not the particular time when it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd, at leaſt a certain Age when it was not ſo believed. And conſequently then the Doctrin of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:58237:9"/>
as ſhe is at variance with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> cannot with any Truth be ſtiled Catholick, nor as it is ſuch, be the occaſion of your Change.</p>
            <p>§. 5. The Second particular is, that the Reformation of any thing, doth not extirpate its former being, and new make it, nor yet eſſentially change it from the ſame thing that it was before; but only rectifying what was formerly amiſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving all things that were repugnant to its Nature, it leaves the Being eſſentially the ſame, but renders it abundantly more pure and illuſtrious. The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> therefore, cannot be truly ſaid to have loſt or changed any of the Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Religion by her Reformation, or any wiſe to ceaſe from being the ſame <hi>Church</hi> that it was before; ſince whatſoever was received by the Primitive Chriſtians, ſhe ſtill holdeth, believeth, and openly profeſſeth; and whatſoever was not ſo, ſhe never could eſteem as part of her Religion. And ſhe hath made no change, either in her Faith or Practice, but by rejecting of ſuch Unchriſtian Novelties, as in the times of Ignorance and oppreſſing Tyranny were ſlily introduc'd, and forcibly impoſed upon her. Whereas in the Canons of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> (which do comprize the Faith, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome)</hi> not only many things reputed by the Ancient Fathers, as uncertain, (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Purgatory</hi>

If therefore you will ſay, that the Religion or the Being of a Church, is to take its beginning from the laſt ſyſtem of the Chriſtian Faith, or the laſt change of Diſcipline that was Eſtabliſht in her; and will conſider farther, that the Faith of a Chriſtian, is to be meaſured <hi>à credendis,</hi> not <hi>à ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatis,</hi> from the points to be believed, not thoſe uncertainties that are deny'd by him; You will find it neceſſary to acknowledge, that the Old Religion is maintained in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and that that of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is of a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58237:9"/>
later date: Since the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (as I ſhew'd before) ſtands by the Primitive Rule of Faith, and what ever was ſo determined by the firſt four General Councils; and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mixture of any Secular Notions, or any thing that is oppoſite, either to Reaſon or the Scriptures; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then, ſhe profeſſeth the ſame Faith, and the ſame Religion, which ſhe ever did, and is not eſſentially changed ſince ſhe was firſt Eſtabliſh'd. But the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath evidently made many changes and innovations, both in Faith and Practice, and hath impoſed new Articles as neceſſary to Salvation, which were never ſo reputed before her Injunction. And therefore in point of Doctrin as alſo, ſhe cannot be truly called the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> nor on that account have drawn you to her Communion.</p>
            <p>§. 6. As to your ſecond Motive, founded upon the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, both of Faith and Practice, which you ſuppoſed in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as that it is more Orthodox than the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> Should I Examine at large every particular Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into which this Point may lead us, to determine it, and which is already extant and diſcuſt fully upon this Subject; it would probably require more time than I can have leiſure to expend, and withal, would ſeem impertinent to my preſent deſign, which is your Satisfaction, with all brevity and plaineſs: Eſpecially, when ſo much hath been ſaid already by more Learned Perſons, that it is almoſt as impoſſible to add to, as to anſwer their Arguments; and I cannot but ſuppoſe, that you are acquainted with them, although you ſeem not ſatisfied nor convinced by their Evidence. It is certainly ſufficient in this caſe, to have recourſe but to our foundation; that our Faith and Worſhip both, are wholly founded upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, have the conſent of the Univerſal <hi>Church,</hi> backt with Reaſon and an uninterrupted Practice, which warrants and maintains whatever we hold as neceſſary, againſt the force of all manner of Opponents. Whereas, the Doctrin and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> is chiefly built upon a looſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or rather indeed, the Projects and Inventions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick Votaries; ſuch <note n="20" place="margin">Quare ſi ſolus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus audiendus eſt, non debemus attendere quid alius ante nos faciendum put averit, ſed quid qui antè omnes eſt.

nor the Law of God be perſwaded to comply with. In ſo much, that ſhould a Stranger but inſpect our <hi>Churches,</hi> and knowing only that God is a Spirit, and that they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth; ſhould he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the grounds and circumſtances of Publick Devotion in them, he would diſcover clearly the Nature of our Religion, both conſonant to Reaſon and the God we Worſhip; while the other is hid in Ceremonies, buried in external I ormalities, and makes but a meer ſhew or pageant of Devotion.</p>
            <p>§. 7. But ſince however, there is one particular caſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in deciding whereof, this Queſtion may be reſolved alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> Whither the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is more Pure and Orthodox, both in Faith and Worſhip? It will not be amiſs to enquire into it briefly, and compare our Faith and Practice, in relation to the Sacrament, which is the moſt Solemn branch of our Devotion. For I ſhall ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it as an obligation from you, if you will be fair in this particular, and communicate your own Thoughts freely without prevarication, whether you can ſubmit your Reaſon in this particular, to that Doctrin of your <hi>Church,</hi> that is ſo much againſt it? Whither you can believe in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as it is openly profeſt, that a Prieſt by Conſecrating Bread and Wine according to the Miſſal, can change their ſubſtance into that of God? Or ſo Eſtabliſh the Divinity in thoſe Creatures, or under the covert of their Accidents, as really to make them, or what you ſee upon the Table, in their Shape, to become a proper Object to be Worſhipt and Adored? For ſince nothing can be more abſurd, nor indeed more criminal in Religion, than to apply God's Worſhip to any thing that is not God; there is nothing leſs than a belief of this particular, that can be pleaded by you, to juſtifie your Practice, when you Worſhip and Adore the Conſecrated Hoſt in the conſtant Exerciſe of your Publick Devotion. Let us enquire therefore, I beſeech you, into the foundation of this Faith, and how this Notion (which appears impoſſible to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind) ſhould come to have that Credit in the Church, as to be made a Principle of the Chriſtian Religion; and not only be received as an Article of Faith, but to be made the ground-work alſo of ſuch a dangerous Practice.</p>

               </note> that our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at the Inſtitution of his Holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, changed the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine, into the ſubſtance of his own Body and Blood.

Now, Sir, if you will but ſeriouſly conſider all thoſe words, which our Saviour Chriſt hath ſpoken on this Subject, together with the end, deſign, and occaſion of his ſpeaking them, it will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear difficult to prove clearly to you, Firſt, that thoſe words of Chriſt are not thus literally to be interpreted; but directly contrary to this Doctrin, their true Senſe is altogether Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Myſtical. And 2<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly,</hi> That if they were literally to be underſtood by all Men, even in the utmoſt Senſe thoſe words can bear, yet they will neither aſſert what the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> Decrees, nor juſtifie your Practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Worſhiping the Hoſt.</p>
            <p>§. 9. Firſt, I ſay that the Words of our Saviour Chriſt in the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, cannot be underſtood in a literal Senſe, but muſt have a ſigurative or myſtical ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb facs="tcp:58237:11"/>
And this doth appear fully from the Nature of the thing, the Deſign of the Inſtitution, the Occaſion of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and our Saviour's own Judgment as to their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
            <p>As to the Nature of the thing, it is a ſufficient proof, that any Text of Scripture is not literally to be underſtood by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, if its common reading contradicts the Rules of Senſe, and Principles of Philoſophy, or deſtroys the ground-work of all certainty and knowledge, and ſo roots up the foundation of Religion in general. And if a Man, by being a Chriſtian, is to take thoſe words of Chriſt in a literal Senſe, and to believe, that that is Fleſh, which by his ſight, touch, taſt, and ſmell, he fully and clearly diſcovers to be Bread, all thoſe recited miſchiefs, are the neceſſary conſequence, and there can be no Rule of any certainty in Religion. In ſo much, that no Man can be ſure, that there is a Bible, or that any ſuch words as theſe we treat of, are Recorded in it; or indeed, that any thing elſe is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in order to his Salvation, if he muſt not truſt his Senſes, being rightly diſpoſed in relation to a proper Object, with a fit Medium. If you ſay, that this is an improper Object, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Subſtance, when Accidents alone do incur the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. I ſay, that there is no other way to know a Subſtance, but by the Accidents that are proper to it; and if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for all the Accidents that are proper to one Subject, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here another, it would be impoſſible to determine, which is which, or ever truly to diſtinguiſh any one thing from another. But it is alſo evident, that a Humane Body is the real thing we here treat of; and that this is a proper Object for our Senſes, appears plainly to us from the practice of our Saviour, in that he recurr'd unto them, even after his Reſurrection, and made them the only Judges of his Bodily Subſtance. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaies he, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 39.) <hi>my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf; han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and ſee, for a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones as you ſee me have.</hi> So that either this Body of Chriſt ſuppoſed in the Sacrament, muſt be a proper Object for our Senſes, or it is not that Body of Chriſt wherewith he aroſe from the Dead: And the Prieſt muſt create another Body, ſuch as our Saviour never had, before he can adapt it to this Doctrin of the Sacrament. It is therefore evidently a device of the School-Men, to impoſe upon the Vulgar, that they generally diſcourſe thus of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58237:11"/>
Object of one Science, in terms and notions that are peculiar to another; and inſtead of Matter and Form, wherein the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Body doth conſiſt, and which do evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that every Humane Body doth conſiſt of Limbs, hath Fleſh and Bones with that Extent, Shape and Dimenſions that are proper to it, and whereof all Mankind are equally ſure and certain: All their Diſputations are about its Subſtance and its Accidents, which are Metaphyſical terms, and may agree with a Spirit, with whoſe Nature and Parts the wiſeſt Men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted. And therefore abſtracting from the Senſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the leaſt intelligent are ſufficient Judges, they confound our Underſtanding in ſuch intricacies and quillets, that even they themſelves cannot explain their meaning. And therefore I ſay, that either our Senſes muſt be Judges in this caſe, as well as other Bodies, or elſe that the Body of Chriſt is not a <note n="22" rend="inter">Chriſtum ubique totum praeſentem eſſe non dubites tanquam Deum, &amp; in eodem templo Dei eſſe tanquam inhabit antem, dum, &amp; in loco aliquo cali, propter veri corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris modum. <hi>Auguſt. ad Dardan.

            <p>I will not trouble you with the recital of any of thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which demonſtrate this Change to be impoſſible, <note n="23" rend="inter">

But this I muſt deſire you to obſerve, that if a ſubſtantial change were made of the Elements by the words of Conſecration, then the act of the Apoſtles was manifeſtly different from the command of Chriſt whereon it was founded. For nothing can be clearer from the Text, than that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gave the Bread, and commanded them to take and eat, (that is, Bread) the words of its Conſecration being not yet pronounced. If then they did eat another ſubſtance and not Bread, who can truly ſay that they fulfilled the Commandment of the Lord, or Received the Sacrament according to his order?</p>

§. 10. As to the Deſign in this moſt Sacred Inſtitution, it appears to be the ſame in relation unto Chriſtians as that of the Paſſover was unto the <hi>Jews.</hi> That as they did believe in a <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was to come, and of whom their Sacrifices were but Types and Shadows, and ſo were partakers of the Sacrifice that he was to offer, by eating of thoſe Sacrifices that did Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically repreſent it: So we that now believe in a <hi>Meſſias</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, ſhould in a parallel manner become Partakers of the ſame Oblation, and by an external act like unto what they did in every Circumſtance, we ſhould obtain the benefit of that propitiatory Sacrifice, and really and truly be made Partakers of it. And therefore our Saviour Chriſt appointed that Bread and Wine ſhould be received by his Diſciples in the place and ſtead of his Body and Blood; which were the real Sacrifice that he offered unto God for Man, and very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per things to be actually eaten or drank by Chriſtians, and therefore he calls the Bread his Body, and the Wine his Blood, not as being really the things themſelves, but as Inſtituted by him to repreſent them to us. So that by a due participation of theſe Creatures according unto Chriſt's appointment, it is certain that all Chriſtians are partakers of that Sacrifice which he offer'd to God for them; and the Bread and Wine being duly Conſecrated and Received in the nature of a Sacrament, the Body and Blood of Chriſt is really and truly received by the Faithful in them; not that the Elements are changed in themſelves, or that there is any real alteration of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but the act is Spiritual in reſpect of the Receivers, who take them not for Food, but as a Myſtery in Religion; and therefore they do not receive them in their common notion as they are Bread and Wine, that is, proper Food to nouriſh or ſuſtain the Body, but as they repreſent the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and are appropriated by Faith to nouriſh and ſupport the Soul. And ſince then this Sacrament was ordained to become a Sacrifice to Chriſtians, as St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yet it was impoſſible that they ſhould eat the Fleſh of Chriſt and drink his Blood accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Letter, becauſe his Body was not framed yet, nor actually born: It is therefore rational to conclude that we are ſtill Partakers of the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they were, not in a Literal but a Spiritual participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Since the reception of them by Faith only was fully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to the Salvation of the one, and therefore is all that is neceſſary to the Salvation of the other.</p>
            <p>§. 11. And this gives us a fair light into the reaſon or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Figurative Expreſſion; in that the Sacrament of the Euchariſt being Inſtituted by our Saviour in the place of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paſſover, which was now to be aboliſhed, many of the External Rites were ſtill retained, to ſhew that all thoſe Types are now compleated: And therefore as it was uſual at the introduction of the Paſchal Lamb, for the Prieſt or ſome other of the Company to tell the People that this is the Lamb that was ſlain in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the Lord paſſed over the houſes of our Fathers, and ſlew the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> And again, after Supper was ended (diſtributing Bread and Wine to every one in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) was wont to tell them, This is the Bread of Sorrow which our Fathers eat in <hi>Egypt:</hi> Whereas all Men know that it could not poſſibly be that very Lamb that was ſlain, nor that very Bread that was eaten in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but another Lamb, and other Bread Inſtituted by God's order in the ſtead or commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: So our Saviour likewiſe at the Inſtitution of the Sacrament uſing the ſame Phraſe upon the like occaſion, ought to be underſtood in the ſame manner of expreſſion. And ſince it was in conformity to their conſtant way of ſpeaking, that when he Inſtituted Bread and Wine to be Received by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the Commemoration of his own death, as that Lamb was of the Paſsover, he ſaid of the Bread <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and of the Wine <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> we are to underſtand by it no more than if he had told us, that they are Elements Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to be Received in the ſtead and commemoration of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood.

Since it is the Spirit that quickneth, and the Fleſh profiteth nothing; and it is not any action of the Body, but the purity and ſincerity of the Mind and Soul that God reſpects in any Holy Exerciſe; and therefore it is this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that ought to be regarded, which unites a Man to Chriſt, and brings down God's Gifts and Graces on him, by a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of that Holy Sacrament</p>

               </note>God hath ſent a ſtrong deluſion that they ſhould believe a lye, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately maintain theſe apparent Contradictions againſt all the force both of ſenſe and reaſon: That I may abate at leaſt your fondneſs for this error, or reſtrain that practice that againſt the Law of God is founded on it, I will offer my ſecond Propoſition alſo to be conſidered, That if thoſe words of Chriſt <hi>(This is my Body)</hi> were to be taken in the literal ſenſe, as effecting ſuch a change as againſt ſenſe and reaſon is aſſerted, to make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition literally true: Yet I ſay they will neither juſtifie your practice in worſhiping the Hoſt, nor maintain the Doctrin of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as by the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it is taught and explained. For it is plain that thoſe words of Chriſt in the moſt literal ſenſe that they can bear, can have no relation farther than to his Body only, and this too in the moſt ſtrict and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed notion of a Sacrifice, wherein Mankind are made Partakers of it: Since (as your ſelves confeſs) <note n="34" place="margin">Here at once is Inſtituted both a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A Sacrifice in that it is ordained to continue the memory of Chriſt's death and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Croſs, and the application of the general virtue thereof to our particular neceſſities, by conſecrating the ſeveral Elements, not into Chriſt's whole Perſon as it was born of the Virgin, or now is in Heaven, but the Bread into his Body apart, as betrayed, broken, and given for us; the Wine into his Blood apart, as ſhed out of his Body for Remiſſion of Sins, and dedication of the New Teſtament, which be the Conditions of his Perſon, as he was in ſacrifice and oblation. <hi>Annotations on the New Teſtament Publiſhed at</hi> Rhems, <hi>on</hi> Mat. <hi>xxvi. 26.</hi>
               </note>the deſign of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

was only this, that all Men might become Partakers by it of the Sacrifice which Chriſt offered upon the Altar of the Croſs, when he made a full atonement for the Sins of the whole World. Now we know that the nature of a Sacrifice is ſuch, that it muſt be ſlain before it can be offered; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently then this Body of Chriſt (into which you do believe that the Elements are changed) muſt be dead as well as broken, and totally abſtracted or ſeparated from the Soul, as it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up in Sacrifice to God; and how this Body then in this very ſtate and notion can be a proper Object for Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is a thing that deſerves to be very well conſidered. For it is very evident that it doth not contain the eſſence of a Man, ſince that conſiſts chiefly in his rational Soul that is departed from it, and to which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tells us <note n="35" rend="inter">Poſtquam enim à Jud is in cruce ſuſpenſus eſt, mox ut ſpiritum reddidit, unita ſuae Divinitati anima ad inferum profunda deſcendit. <hi>Aug.

               </note>that the Divinity was united. And therefore though all his Sufferings in the Fleſh are truly attributed to him as the Son of God, becauſe it was Chriſt that ſuffered, who really was that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſon, yet when we ſay that he was buried, it is an improper way of ſpeaking (as that <note n="36" rend="inter">Ex toto autem pars ſignificatur, cùm dicitur Chriſtus ſepultus, cùm ſola ejus caro ſepulta ſit. <hi>Ibid. de Anima.

               </note>Father obſerves) and doth expreſs no more but the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of his Body only, ſince it is evident that it was not the Perſon of Chriſt, but only his Body that was ſubject to that Paſſion. We generally look upon it as an infinite condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Almighty God that he united his Divine unto our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature even in its greateſt purity and perfection: But to expect that this Divinity ſhould be immediately united unto the groſſer part of Man, even his Body or Carcaſs, when his Rational Soul is ſeparated from it, and when you cannot truly ſay that even the Human Nature continues extant there; And much more to believe then that any Prieſt whatſoever can effect this condeſcention at his pleaſure, and by the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a Material Subſtance only unite the Divine Nature to the accidents of Bread and Wine; which muſt then be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the whole Suppoſitum, or ſubſiſt by themſelves, and ſo ceaſe to be Accidents: Theſe are thoughts too hard to be entertained of God, except he himſelf in every Circumſtance had expreſly declared and promis'd it in Scripture.

               </note>hath joyned the Soul of Chriſt together with his Body, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company his Divinity in the Sacrament: Inſomuch that I have heard a Doctor of Laws of that Communion declare, that he believed that the Hoſt after its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration was as rational, diſcurſive, and viſible as any Man. But on what Authority all this Confidence is founded, I profeſs I am in the dark as to its diſcovery. For take thoſe words of Chriſt <hi>(this is my Body)</hi> in any ſenſe that they can bear, and certainly nothing more than the Body of Chriſt can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in them (beſides their Myſtical ſignification) and if you will limit this unto the notion of a Sacrifice, as I ſhewed you muſt, that will infer directly that his Soul muſt be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from it. And ſurely then whoſoever he is that pretends to Miracles, to act not only beyond the Power and the very Conceptions of a Man, but even directly againſt all ſenſe and reaſon; He ought to produce at leaſt the Commiſſion that God hath given him for to do ſuch things, with ſuch ample Clauſes and Expreſſions in it as confer that Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception: Otherwiſe Men cannot believe him that he is ſent by God, but will undoubtedly reject him, and deſpiſe his Doctrin. The Conſequence then is this, That even the moſt literal ſenſe of Chriſt's words being granted, yet the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Hoſt is not to be adored: But this conſtant practice of Worſhiping it at Maſs is a Crime not juſtifiable in any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, being directly contrary to the firſt Commandment in the Law, and our Saviours Confirmation of it in the Goſpel; where he hath expreſly commanded us in theſe unqueſtionable terms, <hi>Thou ſhalt Worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> Mat. iv. 10.</p>

               </note>whenever the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Sacrament began, one of the Deacons ſtood up and Exhorted all Perſons that were unfit for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, to retire. So that inſtead of the common notion that is received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People, that in the Maſs a Sacrifice is offered for all that are preſent at it: There is oftner a danger than an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in ſuch an attendance, and inſtead of taking away, it rather adds unto their Sins: Since all Men know that the Sacrament cannot be beneficial but only unto thoſe that worthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, as its very Inſtitution, Nature, and Promiſes do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: But it is very injurious unto all Spectators that are not duly qualified for to joyn in the Communion.</p>

words can bear, yet you are daily guilty of a moſt grievous Sin; and this not altogether in a careleſs run of irregular practice, but in the Solemn Acts of your Publick Devotion; and yet all this miſchief you have drawn upon you gratis, without any the leaſt proſpect of an imaginary Benefit, there being no advantage which you can pretend to now, that you did not as fully and as clearly enjoy before you were perſwaded for to alter your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. I will not therefore preſs you with any farther Arguments to return, to renew your firſt love, and to bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance; ſince I have reaſon to hope that you will never ſhut your eyes againſt the light, nor obſtinately withſtand your own Salvation. But when you ſeriouſly conſider, and carefully weigh the Arguments that are offered to you, and have ſtrictly examined the Principles of your Religion with a Rational indifference, and a Chriſtian diligence, that that Grace of God that hath influenc'd your former Practice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
