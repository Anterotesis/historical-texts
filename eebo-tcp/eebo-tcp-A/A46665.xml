            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
EPISTLE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THe Author of this Treatise, now
put into thine Hands, needs
none of my <hi>Praises;</hi> he being
lately gone, to make one in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
with that Heavenly Chore above,
his Works praise him in the Gate; only
I could not but lend my hand a little,
being desired to give it a lift into the
World; and tell thee the Author was a
man of Designes for God, and more of
them he had in his Heart and Head,
then his Lord and Master (whose he was,
and whom he served) did give him time
<pb facs="tcp:49964:3"/>
to Finish; that his Master might be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
and souls Edified, he tryed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Ways, and that with several sorts
of persons; leaving no stone unturn'd,
no means unattempted, that the Work
of the Lord might Prosper in his hand.
One while he designes sinners might be
helped in getting Acquaintance with
God,<note place="margin">Witness that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Treatise of his.</note> and that Saints might improve
their <hi>Best Friend in the Worst of
Times;</hi> and to that end he appears in
the world, to drive on a good Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
betwixt Christ and Souls. And
another while, feeling warm Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Affections bubbling up in his
Soul to poor <hi>Young Converts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Death Unstung, <hi>T. Mousley T. Savage</hi>
               </note> he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
on a design of strengthning their
weak hands, by appearing once again
upon the Stage, in printing the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Death of a Young Convert. And
another while he had a design of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the ripening sinnes of youth;
witness his bowelly and tender-hearted
Sermon upon the occasion of the <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Murderer,</hi> in which he Cautions
poor enticed Young men to take heed of
<pb facs="tcp:49964:3"/>
the Baits, that the great Angler for
Souls, layes before them. But lest this
man of Designes for God, should miss
his great aime, he shoots lower, that he
might hit his Mark, he stoops, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condescends, to send <hi>Tokens to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
to bespeak their Hearts betimes
for Christ, his Master; he labours to
Teach the Children to cry <hi>Hosanna</hi> to
his Lord: And now in the last place,
he casts about to meet with <hi>Sea-faring
Men,</hi> whose Souls he alwayes had bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and melting bowels for. Oh how
would he Weep, Pray, Mourn, Sigh over
them; entreat them Affectionately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
them importunately, that they
would not forget the God of their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Deliverances; nor the Mercies
and Deliverances of their God. Upon
this Occasion of <hi>Sea-mens</hi> receiving
the greatest Deliverances of any men in
the World from God, and so soon play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Old Israelites with Gods Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<hi>(viz.)</hi> soon forgetting his Works.</p>
            <p>Some Friends speaking to him upon
this subject, and Acquainting him with
<pb facs="tcp:49964:4"/>
a Taste of some Memorable Passages of
Providences, he readily upon desire, sets
his hand to this work of Collecting seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Famous Deliverances from Friends;
and took pains to get their Papers into
his hands, but had not time to pollish
and adorn them in his sweet and taking
Style, as he did other things. These lay
upon his hand above a Year and a half,
still waiting for more Observable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
to come to his Cognizance:
But here thou hast them as they are, if
thou hast an Heart to improve them, to
thy further strengthening of thy Faith in
future Straits: Whether at <hi>Sea</hi> or <hi>Land,</hi>
here thou mayst see the Lord setting his
Right Foot upon the Sea. Here thou
mayst see the Lords Royalty and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
extending it self to the great
Deeps. Here thou mayst see the Winds
&amp; Seas obeying of him. Here thou mayst
see the Lord giving a literal Com<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ent on
that Text, <hi>When thou goest through
the Waters, I will be with thee.</hi> Here
thou mayst see Hopeless, and Helpless
men, in their greatest Distress at their
<pb facs="tcp:49964:4"/>
wits end, sav'd and deliver'd by the
great God: which is enough, one would
think, to make any Reader cry out with
the Psalmist, <hi>O that men would praise
the Lord for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the Children of
Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here thou mayst see the prevailing
Power of Prayer, the Wonder-working
Power of God, the unspeakable Bowels

dying Men; that thou mayst Pray to
this God more, Love this God better, and

God of such Miraculous Salvations and
Deliverances. And that this Treatise
may promote that work in thy Soul, is the

who knew not where to have another
morsel to fortify the tyred and spent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
with the constant toyle, and hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
how they look one up one another,
as men already under a Sentence of death;
and by one anothers looks, Strike terror
to one anothers Hearts; They look on
every side, (as <hi>David</hi> says) <hi>I looked on
my right hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 142 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>but there was no man

downward, they seeing nothing but the
Belly of destruction opening for them;
they look upward, the onely, and last
refuge, and remedy, in this deplorable
estate was out of the depths, they cry'd
to the Lord.</p>
            <p>But though they look out of the Ship,

and send forth the Dove of Prayer,

them into dolefull and dismall Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;

they fall upon their involuntary Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
Major <hi>Gibbons</hi> calls them to Prayer,
considering, that in the Mount, the Lord
is often seen, and that many times our
extremity proves Gods opportunity; he
also askes the poor man if he was willing
to dye; but O what a hard Question is
that to Answer! He replys, if it might
preserve the rest of the lives, he could be
the more willing; to which he hath this
Answer: All events are in the hands of
God, we must not dispute them, to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer

O what joy was here at such a token for
good! not only it at present releiving and
refreshing their hunger, which no Question
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49964:7"/>
made them quick Cooks; but when they
looke upon the Finger of God in it, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it as an answer to prayer, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it an happy Omen of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and a pledg of approaching mercy:
but alas, it is not long before their hearts
grow faint again, their Countenances pale,
their Spirits sink now as low as they were
lifted up high; and now the poor Sea-men
are like their Ship, one while mounted up
in the hopes to Heaven, and another while
they are sunk down again in despair as
low as hell; they know not now of another
cake, another Morsell, they are reduced
to their former exigency, which brings
them to a resolve to steer in this strait,
their old course; to Lotts they go again
the Second time, only they have such an
honour for the Providence of God, they
will not put him into condemnation, that
God hath acquited; the Lott now falls
upon another person, and O now they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the old trouble, and intestine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats,
how they shall find in their Hearts,
to punish one, that never had offended
any of them; and while one thinks of it,
sayes he, Alas poor man, what hath he done
to deserve this sentence? another crys, Will
not this blood cleave to my Conscience
another day? though I went to this expe-expedition
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49964:8"/>
a Prest-Souldier? another
says, for his part he sees no way but death,
therefore he cannot take away life, when
he sees not any life can be preserved by it:
but they are called again to look upward,
before they put the Knife to the Throat of
this Sacrifice, and they remember the last
encouragement to put life into the almost
dead-mens Prayers; they pray now with
a pledge in their hands, and are ready to
tell God, the last time he gave them a
Pawn, an Earnest; and O it is not vain to
seek the Lord! for loe, while they are
seeking to him, he is sending to them; as
the Prayers flye to Heaven, Mercy is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
upon the wings from Heaven.</p>
            <p>O turn aside, and see this great sight,
while they are praying. Behold a second
Answer from above; A great Bird lights
and fixes her self upon the Mast, which
one in the Company espies, and up he
goes, and there she stands until he took
her with his hand by the wing, &amp; brought
her down to the Company; and O what
life from the dead is this to them a second
time! Sure they will hearken to the voyce
of the second Sign, if not to the voyce of
the first; and now that which they hoped
by the first Providence <hi>(viz.)</hi> that it was
a fore-runner of the compleat delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
Now they are by this second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49964:8"/>
in the Faith, and now they begin
to think (as I can easily imagin) if God
will save them out of this distress, O what
manner of persons they will become!
what manner of lives they will live! what
Sacrifices of Thanksgiving will they offer
up to God! but while they are thus think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they have no visible hopes, but that it
must be a third Miracle that brings them
out of this their miserable condition; they
have the same disappointments upon them
still, only now they divert their Hunger
all they can, by telling of, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the Loaves, (as I may say) their
experiences in this extremity of theirs,
and comforting themselves, that if they
come to a third strait, it would (they
hoped) be an outlet from their present
misery and calamity: They are reduced
the third time to the former course and
strait, to cast Lotts; and when they were
to go to the heart-aking work, to put him
to death, upon whom the Lott fell, they
go to their Old Friend, in a day of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
(to God) by hearty and humble
Prayer: And O now they do, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
man at the Sea-side, look again and
again, but alas Master they cry, <hi>there is
nothing.</hi> Prayer is done, concluded, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
appears; O but as the Prophets
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49964:9"/>
Man looked seaven times, so says this
good man Major <hi>Gibbons,</hi> look again, as
<hi>Ionah,</hi> I will look again towards his Holy
Temple (says he to one of the Company)
<hi>Go up to the top, and see what you can espy;</hi>
and at last he makes a Sayl, <hi>(viz.)</hi> espys
a Ship; this puts new life into all their
spirits; they bear up with the Vessel,
they Man their Boat, they desire in the
manner of perishing, humble Suppliants
to Board them, which they are Admitted;
the Vessel proves a <hi>French</hi> Vessel, yea, a
<hi>French</hi> Pyrate; Major <hi>Gibbons</hi> Petitions
him for a little Bread to sustain their lives,
who had been several days wishing for
death, but could not find it in their Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and take the Ship and Cargo. So
sweet is life, that all that a man hath will
he give for his life; and now behold, God
draws forth to these Poor Perishing men
his best Wine to the last, nay, turns the
Water of Affliction into the Wine of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.
The Commander of the Vessel
knows the Major, and replys readily and
chearfully, Major <hi>Gibbons,</hi> not one hair
of your head shall perish, nor any of your
Ships Company, if it lye in my power ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to supply you, or preserve you. O
the Wisdom of God that hath ways we
know not of, to Relieve in the greatest
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49964:9"/>
straits, and cause himself to be seen in the
Mount. The Commander of this <hi>French</hi>
Pyrat was one some years before that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
<hi>Gibbons</hi> had shown signal Kindness to,
when his life was in danger at <hi>Boston</hi> in
<hi>New England.</hi> Thus the Lord appeared
a God, hearing Prayers in Extremitys,
which appearances are not to be forgotten
in succeeding Generations. O that men
would praise the Lord for his goodness,
and for his wonderful works to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men.</p>
            <p>Secondly: About the year 1636. there
arising a storm and tempest of troubles in
the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> five Ministers,
eminent for Piety, Learning, and the
Honourable success in the Ministry, were
so hard born under by a prevailing Party
imposing upon their Consciences, that
they were forced to Embarque them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for <hi>America;</hi> three of their names
were Mr. <hi>Levinston,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mackleland,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Blaire,</hi> with two more whom my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
could not call to mind.</p>
            <p>These good men Sayled half the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
over, about 500. Leagues, where
they met with great distress of weather,
which broke off the Rudder of their Ship,
and occasioned a desperate leak to spring
in her, which exposed them to eminent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49964:10"/>
danger; but they in this distress endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to hang on their Rudder again, but
often were they frustrated in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to a total despair of effecting it.
They also laboured with the like unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfulness
to find out and stop the leak;
this poor Ships Crew had laboured also
by pumping, to keep the Ship above wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
until all their few hands were feeble,
and all their hearts faint; so that as so
many dispairing persons of life, they cease
all endeavours, and yield themselves to
death, expecting every moment to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed
in the belly of the devouring
deeps; during the time of this their great
distress, the Ministers kept on their course,
as at other times of Worship, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the
reading of a Chapter in course, and taking
observations from it, with Prayer and
Preaching, which they did by turns; at
the crisis of this deplorable case, it fell to
be the Lott of Mr. <hi>Mackleland</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this Exercise, a man Austeer in his
life, reserved in his speech, and of great
Piety, who was often observed to let fall
many remarkable Prophetical Expressions
of future events; the Chapter that at
that time came to be read in course by
him, was the 32 of <hi>Exodus,</hi> which he had
read all along (until he came to the 12th.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49964:10"/>
               <hi>vers.</hi>) where he made a full stop; the
verses run thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> Moses <hi>besought the Lord his God,
and said, Lord, why doth thy Wrath wax
hot against thy people, which thou hast
brought out of the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>with
great Power, and a mighty hand? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should the Egyptians say, for mischief
did he bring them out to slay them in the
Mountains, and to consume them from the
face of the Earth? Turne from thy severe
Wrath, and repent of this Evil against thy
People.</hi>—upon the reading of these ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
over again, he declared to them the
Case, which <hi>Moses</hi> was here intercee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for, compared with his Expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the 12 verse, did parallel the case,
and considering the happy event of that
Argument, which <hi>Moses</hi> used (mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the 14 verse, which runs thus:) <hi>and
the Lord Repented of the Evil which he
brought to doe unto his People</hi>—he
could not but comfortably hope, that
they might have the same Effect: Nay
he goes further, and his Spirit raised into
a peremptory prediction, that he durst as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
them from his great Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
that not one hair of their heads
should fall to the ground; after this he
went to Prayer, urging God with the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49964:11"/>
same Argument, and then rose up com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
assuring his stedfastness in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the same; he advises the Sea-men
and the Company in the Ship to refresh
themselves by taking some meat, the long
fasting and hard labour having much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled
them. Then he encouraged
them to make another Attempt to fasten
the Rudder, without which they could
not possible make towards any point for
shore. He after advised them to clear
the ship as well as they could from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by pumping, which they did happily
Effect, the Leak being stopt providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
of it self—whether it was
some noak of a plank started by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
of weather which occasioned the
Leak, and by the surges of the Sea, clapt
into the place againe, or what it was,
else could not be known. But however
this lookes like life from the dead to
these poor men who had received but a
little before a sentence of Death in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that they might trust in him who
raiseth the Dead. Soon after this, God
who had heard in Heaven great Tears
and Prayers, Commands the Wind,
Tack about to the West, and to blow so
strong a gale that they were forced to
bear up before it, and it continued so
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49964:11"/>
long, that it brought them back to the
North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they continued
some time; although but short, they
were very instrumental in the Converting
of many souls, which seed-plot remains to
this day; and soon after they passed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Scotland.</hi> This Relation was given
by several Ministers of the North of
<hi>Ireland:</hi> also the Reader may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
the Author of that Book called the
<hi>fullfilling of the Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fullfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>pag.</hi> 487.</note> mentiones
this remarkable Providence, though not
so largely with these two additional, but
very considerable circumstances; first,
That a poor Sea-man was made the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
to preserve the same Vessel, by
fastening the Rudder, whose company
they had all shun'd, others having given
it over. Secondly: Several Passengers
being Aboard, who shipt themselves for
<hi>America,</hi> upon only external accounts,
expecting a fat soyle, and outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in that place, and not as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
upon the account of Conscience, to
enjoy the purity of Ordinances; they did
all dye upon the Sea save one, being five
in number. And who is so blind, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see here the out-stretched Arm of an
Omnipotent God, commanding delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
for his poor distressed, persecuted,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49964:12"/>
praying, believing Servants, and also
for all them that Sayled with them? O
who would not Pray at Sea, and trust in
him who raises the dead in the saddest of
their Extremities and distress! and speaks
forth much of the power and goodness of
God, calling upon all to trust in him, let
the dangers and straits be never so great.</p>
            <p>3. A Vessel of ours about the year
1636. being at New-found Land a Fishing,
being somewhat of the latest in the year,
until the Ice came in great flakes; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ready to hoise Sayle for the return
home, they sent out in the Boat six of the
men to weigh their Anchor; but while
they were about it, a sad Providence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
them, a great flake of Ice interposes
between them and their ship, and carryes
them adrift, so that by all means that they
and the ship could use, they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their Vessel again, whereby they
were exposed to an inevitable ruine, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
having Food, nor any other Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to keep them warm; they having
continued thus three days &amp; three nights,
they began to be Hunger-starv'd, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
themselves all dead men, they
began to consult one with another what
course to take; they at last, though with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49964:12"/>
great regret and grief, they resolve one of
them must dye to become Food for the
rest; each person begg'd to have it his
Lott to dye first, to be freed from that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that they languished under; so that
they were forced to determine it by Lott:
He upon whom the Lott fell, desired to
go to the end of the Boat, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
his soul to God by Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he dyed; the rest being in a deep A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony
upon apprehension of shedding the
blood of one of their Comerades: But
while they were sate together, lamenting
and imploring God's favour to prevent
such a fact according to that they wished
and desired: The person separated by
Lott for death, dyed upon the place where
he was praying, which in their deplorable
Condition occasioned great Joy to the
rest, that hereby they were not forced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their wills to take his life; so look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon this as a good <hi>Omen,</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to satisfie their Hungers upon the
dead body: the Boat was still A-drift, not
frozen up; so that by that time, their Food
was spent, they were brought ashore
many Leagues to the Norward of <hi>New-England,</hi>
where the five landed alive,
where the poor <hi>Barbarians</hi> did commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them, and help them as they could;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49964:13"/>
three of them dyed with the distress they
had been in, the other two made a shift
to get to <hi>New-England,</hi> and so at last, by
a good hand of God upon them, came to
their Habitations in the West of <hi>England,</hi>
having both lost their heels with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of the cold in the Boat. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
my Author had from one of these
two Sea-men, with whom he came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a Passenger from <hi>Ireland,</hi> to
whom he shewed his heels so lost.</p>
            <p>4. A small Vessel, about 45 Tun, the
Masters name <hi>Phillip Hangare,</hi> coming
upon the Coast of <hi>New-England,</hi> they
suddenly sprang a leak, and so foundred:
There were in this poor miscarrying Vessel
18 Sea-men and Passengers; 12 of the
men got into the Long-boat, and as that
was suddenly brought to their minds in
this surprise, they threw into their Boat
also some small matters of Provisions, but
they were wholly without fire: These 12
men at that time of the year about <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmas,</hi>
(and as <hi>Paul</hi> said in his Voyage,
<hi>Sayling was become dangerous</hi>) Sayled five
hundred Leagues, and were to a Miracle
preserved all that time in this small Boat,
five weeks; but it pleased the Lord, who
appears in our straits most, to send them
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49964:13"/>
great relief, by causing some flying Fish
to fall into the Boat, which they eat raw,
and were unto them more acceptable
than the greatest rarities and dainties
at another time; God's Providence
now proving the Caterer, they catch'd a
Shark, and that Ravenous Fish that uses
to prey upon men, now becomes a prey
to these poor distressed Creatures; but
they were glad of food in the want of fire,
and have an heat in their Stomacks, to
eat that raw, and digest at this time what
would have made them sick at other
times; but alas, another want they had,
was drink as well as fire, but they were
forced to open the belly of this Shark, and
suck his blood for drink; at last, that
God who hath a desire to the work of his
own hands, gives them hopes to release
them out of this insupportable misery,
by letting them come to a discovery of
Land in the <hi>West-Indies;</hi> but alas, they
were so weak, that when they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore,
one or two of them dyed; but most
of them lived to declare the works of
the Lord.<note place="margin">Mr. Gedney <hi>of</hi> New England.</note> This the Author had from one
of the 12 that were thus miraculously
preserved, but since cast away at Sea.</p>

5. Captain <hi>Ionas Clark,</hi> of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
going for <hi>Virginia,</hi> the Vessel was
Cast away in a strange amazing manner,
about two hours before day, among the
<hi>Indians</hi> where the Ship-wrackt men lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore
in great fear; but three days after
they thought to get their ship off again; to
which end the Master, with some others,
went into the boat, they came threescore
Fathom from the shore, where there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
a great Sea, and broke in upon them;
but the second Sea came and turned the
boat up; four men under water, all were
drowned, but Captain <hi>Clark,</hi> who was
kept under water by one of the men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
his breath was gone, but then God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and set him at liberty from him in
a most Miraculous way, and inabled him
to swim to the shore; they that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
now, were in great straits and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
not knowing what to do, but
yet some of their eyes were up to God;
at last they Unanimously resolve to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
and when they had Travelled one
night, and part of a day, meeting with
many Suamps and thick places, so that
all hope failed them of going along; so
they stood still as (wayfaring men) asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,
not knowing what course to take;
and though before they were afraid of any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49964:14"/>
               <hi>Indians,</hi> now they were glad to pray to
to the Lord for the sight of an <hi>Indian,</hi>
which in this extremity and perplexity,
within half an hour the Lord was pleased
to grant: The <hi>Indian</hi> was all alone, which
was observable also; when they got to
him, they asked the way to the <hi>English,</hi>
and they did perswade him by entreaty
to go along with them, but within one
hours time, he carryed them to a Town
of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which did sadly fright and
amaze them; but they still looked up to
the Lord to help and save them; but at
last they got to the <hi>English,</hi> and so were
preserved.</p>
            <p>This Relation the Author had from
Captain <hi>Clarks</hi> own hand, a person
of known Godliness and Integrity.</p>
            <p>6. The last Providence called to mind
a strange and stupendious passage of a
Godly Gentlewoman, who in the first
breaking forth of the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
was forced to fly for her life, with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
persons in her Company; especially
three Children, one of them upon her
Breast: But alas, these poor trembling
Travellers had not gone long before they
were striped Naked by the <hi>Irish,</hi> who to
admiration spared their lives; but passing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49964:15"/>
on to the foot of a River, others met them,
and would have cast them into the River;
but this Godly Woman not being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed,
asked a little liberty to Pray, and
as she lay on frozen ground Naked, she
got a little resolution not to go on her own
feet to so unjust a death; upon which
having called her, upon her resolution,
they drag'd her by the heels along the
ground, with the rest of the Company;
she turns upon them, and on her knees
says, <hi>You should I am sure be Christians, and
men I see you are; in taking away our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
lives you do us a pleasure; but know,
as we never wronged you, nor yours, you
must dye also your selves, and one day give
an account of this Cruelty to the Iudge of
Heauen and Earth.</hi> Suddenly upon
which,<note place="margin">An extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary thing, they being the greatest instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Cruelty in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> an <hi>Irish</hi> Priest says, <hi>Let us not take
their lives, but we will put them in this
Island of the Lake;</hi> a Boat being at the
River, all the eight Naked and without
Meat, are turned into that Island, where
after four days staying, some of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
dyed with Hunger and Cold, but
not this Woman, nor any of her Children;
a day after, the two Boys found the Hyde
of a Beast which had been kill'd at the
root of a Tree, which they and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
endeavoured to cast over them; then
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49964:15"/>
lying upon the Snow, the next day a little
Boat goes by, to whom she calls for God's
sake to take her out; but they refused,
being <hi>Irish;</hi> she desired a little Bread, but
they said they had none; she begs a Coal
of Fire, which she obtained, for she had
some fewel in the Boat, and thus with
some fallen Chips, made a fire; and the
Boys taking a piece of the Hyde, layd it
upon the Coals, and began to gnaw the
Leather; but alas, without an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Divine support, what could this do?
Thus they lived ten days without any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
supplies, and that good Woman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
it was by Faith and Joy in God she
lived; nor had she any Bread but Ice and
Snow, nor any Drink but Water, but she
thought God put more substance in it, and
found it as it were clammy. The next
day a Boat carryed her out to the side of
the Band-water, where yet she had been
lost, but that she could not suffer to see her
Children dye in her sight; and therefore
(though the two Boys were young, and so
Starved, that they had no strength) she
pressed them to go out of her sight, under
pretence of seeking som fire; the poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
had not gone far until they saw two
or three great Doggs eating a man who
had been killed; the Children were afraid
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49964:16"/>
the <hi>Doggs</hi> (who needed not fear any
thing but to live in such a Condition)
and one of them came running, and leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon one of the Children, without
doing him the least hurt, and would run a
little before, and then tarry until the
Children come up, and so led them on
where an House whence Smoke appeared,
which was an Irish mans, Protected by the
English in <hi>Antrum,</hi> by which means they
were marvellously pleased, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sent for, and succoured by a party
from <hi>Antrum.</hi> Although this Providence
be not a Sea-deliverance, yet it is a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
preservation from danger by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Hunger, at Land.</p>
            <p>7. In the first setling of the <hi>Bohemia</hi>
Islands off the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Florida,</hi> about the
year 1642. there were at that present
great troubles in the <hi>Burmoudas,</hi> one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Sale</hi> who had been Governour the
year before, comes for <hi>London,</hi> and here
informing some of his Acquaintance,
and Persons of Worth and Estate, how
things then stood, they undertake for
him, and got him a Ship, and all things
necessary for the discovery of these Islands
which he had informed them of, so
they proceeded to <hi>Burmoudas,</hi> where
they took in several Passengers, Captain
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49964:16"/>
               <hi>Sale</hi> being Cheif, and Captain <hi>Lane</hi> and
his Family which came from <hi>London</hi> with
him as his Assistant in the management of
the Designe, so they in pursute of the
Voyage, came to an Island called <hi>Cicatra,</hi>
he lay down in the Platts, where they
could not at present find an Harbour. So
they sent out their <hi>Shallop</hi> upon a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
which upon Return informed
them of a better place to Ride in.—But
sending out the <hi>Shallop</hi> again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a discovery, before she Returned,
there arose a dreadful Storm that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
her immediately upon the <hi>Rocks,</hi>
and staved her with very much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
most of the People were saved
and some Provisions. Then were they
Reduced to very great straits formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to flesh and blood, a Barren Island,
no inhabitants, no likelyhood of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif,
little Provisions left; in this great
strait most of them resolved to travel
up to the wester end of the Island and
there to abide. (Captaine <hi>Lane</hi> and his
Family, and his Son who was his Leiute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant)
theye Rsolved to seek for some kind
of Provisions, and so stayed on the Island.
But Captaine <hi>Sale</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Bounly</hi>
who had been Master of the Ship, and
some other Sea-men, and one Mr. <hi>Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel;</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:49964:17"/>
in all eight, Resolved to go to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi>
and took what Provisions they
could get, which was one <hi>Shark;</hi> but
before they made to the Land they were
in very great wants; For from this Island
from whence they departed to <hi>Virginia,</hi>
was three hundred Leagues: in their now
great Extreamity, Providence cared
for them, so that they got another <hi>Shark,</hi>
and were glad to eat him Raw. They
were a 11 dayes going to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and
the <hi>Boat</hi> a very little one, that they could
scarcely Steer in her for fear of danger.
Yet the Lord in this deep Distress,
made his Arm bare for their Salvation,
and brought them safe to a place called
<hi>Nuse-mum,</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Richard Brunkets</hi>
House, where they were curtiously En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained;
and after the Relation upon
what account they were put to these
Hardships and Necessities, Captain
<hi>Sale</hi> had a Vessel provided laden with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,
to go for <hi>Cicatra,</hi> to Relieve
those they had left there in such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
and they arrived there. And O
now what Comfort must this be, after
such long wishing and gradual Dying,
to see that there was now Hopes of
Life brought to them; but several of
them were starved to Death before their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49964:17"/>
Arrival. Captain <hi>Lane</hi> is now sent to
fetch some Provisions who had been in
unspeakable Extremity. He came down
in a little <hi>Boat,</hi> his Son also the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and two Servants, but when they
had gotten in their Provision, and going
home with hopes of a new Life; Behold,
the stupendious providence of God, all
of a sudden Death creeps in and Arrests
them. For in a narrow place where
the Tyde runs swiftly, the <hi>Boat</hi> is sunk,
all are drowned but one man, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the desolate Widdow the sad Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings!
what an unwelcome Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
this was you may easily conjecture;
about three months after arrived a Vessel
to them (the master of her my Author,)
and so Mrs. <hi>Lane,</hi> her Son and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Maid Servant and Man Servant,
where all brought up about forty miles,
where they were entertained by my Author
for six weeks, and gave an account of some
notable passages of Gods Providence
in preserving them. Worthy never to
be forgotten! Her Husband and the men
went out to see what they could get for
Food every Day, and they had for the
most part just for the Day, and she
told my Author that she as a tender
hearted Mother would lay something
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49964:18"/>
by for her younger Children; but she
observed that the next Day they never
got any thing.</p>
            <p>And thus Providence trained them up
in the School of Faith; but further she
gave an account of one Remarkable
thing, In the last day of the week, upon
a time it proved a very stormy Day,
and they being abroad a hunting for some
support could get nothing. The Husband
and Son comes home very much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and the men that was gon into
the Woods they could get nothing; and
they being very much troubled, one
took up a Resolution not to come home,
knowing their Captain would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to go and hunt on the Lords
Day; on the other hand they thought
he would wonder what was become of
them, and fear lest evil had befallen
them; so they alter their Resolution to
come home, but empty of any Reliefe;
this very Evening before the Sabbath
in this perplexety of thoughts, there flys
over their Heads three gray <hi>Geese;</hi> a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it was for such <hi>Geese</hi> that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen before nor after. O says she
to her Husband, that we had some of
them against to morrow! observing they
lighted in a Bottome, she aquaints her
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49964:18"/>
Husband, he says they have no shot left.
O says she, here is a Porrenger, melt it or
cut it into peices, which he did for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
and charged his Peice, and at
the first shot kill'd them all,—These
things, and many more my Author had
from her own Mouth, after her mervellous
Preservation. O that men would Praise
the Lord, for his wonderful Works to
the Children of Men!</p>
            <p>8. We have a very wonderful Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
recorded, an honest poor man in
<hi>Maulden</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> one <hi>Gregory Crove,</hi> who
with his man and boy, was in his Boat go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to fetch Fullers-Earth; but by the way
meeting with a Storm, his Boat was driven
upon a banck of sand, and their sunk; the
men were glad to hange upon the Mast, but
poor <hi>Crove</hi> seeing his New-Testament in
the water, which he prized highly, caught
it up, and took it into his Bosom; the
tyde being gone, they were left upon the
sand, at lest ten miles from land; now in
this great Distresse they made their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
to the Lord, that he would send some
means of Deliverance: For now within
half an hour it would be flood, but in this
little time before flood they found a
Chest wherein was five pounds six Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49964:19"/>
eight pence, but honest <hi>Crove</hi> cast it
into the Sea again saying, <hi>If the Lord will
please to save our lives he will provide us a
little food;</hi> and so they went again up the
Mast, where they to Admiration hung by
the Arms and Leggs, for ten hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
in which the Boy was so weary, and
beaten with the Waves that he fell off, and
was drowned; now their fears encrease
upon them, and knows not what to do.
But <hi>Crove</hi> advises his man to cut down the
Mast, and when the flood comes again,
to sit upon it, and so, sayes he, it may please
God to drive us to some Ship; this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
was taken, they commit themselves to
God upon this Mast, and thus continued
<hi>Tuesday</hi> Night, <hi>Wednesday,</hi> and <hi>Wednesday</hi>
Night; in which time the man was so
tired out with Hunger, Watching, and
Cold, that he dyed; now was <hi>Crow</hi> left
alone in this sad and deplorable Condition,
who prayed now the more earnestly for
some Succor and Relief, but durst not
Sleep, lest the Sea should beat him off the
Mast; and when this distressed miserable
object was almost spent, his flesh sodden
with Sea water, and his eyes almost closed
up with the Salt, now in his Extremity the
Lord makes it his opportunity, and steps
in by his Providence, presents a Ship go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49964:19"/>
for <hi>Antwerp:</hi> (observe here the Finger
of God:) The Wind not being favourable
was driven out of the way, and espying
something a far off in the Sea, but suppose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be some Fisher-boy steered from
it. <hi>Crove</hi> seeing this, held up his Cap and
shake it over his head, whereby at length
they were moved to go to him, and so
they took him in; when he came into the
Ship, being half dead, carefull of his New
Testament, he pluckt it out of his Bosome
&amp; gave it to some to dry. They in the Ship
were carefull of him, and with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
recovered him,<note place="margin">Fox's Book of Martyrs.</note> and carryed him with
them to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where the fame of his
being miraculously delivered, drew many
to see him, and relieve him with neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</p>
            <p>9. A Ship of <hi>Holland</hi> being driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her will, came to a Place called
<hi>Zembla</hi> where the Pole is elevated Seventy
Six degrees; they among many delays,
and great dangers, they scarce reached the
Aurange-Islands; for now they were set
fast in a Consolidated body of continued
Ice, which threatned them every moment;
at last being reduced to their ultimate
hope, they resolve to return the same
way they came, but now they find the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49964:20"/>
Ship quite frozen up, not far from shore,
and now they think they should winter in
<hi>Zembla</hi> and waite for a better Season,
wherefore taking out Boards and Plancks,
they built for themselves, and their Stuffe,
a poor shelter &amp; by a good Providence, the
Tide had thrown up a good quantity of
Timber, they not knowing from whence
it came, it proved a great advantage to
them during their abode; here they had
continnall fights with Bears, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
were driven away with making
great out-crys, other whiles with Shot;
they found their flesh unwholesome for
food. (For in this place the Maritine wild
Beasts, are the food to the wild Beasts
of the land) the fat of the Beares they
made use of to burn for lights in the night;
these poor creatures were at last, after all
other Human Benefits, left by the Sun, in
this Barren Country, and left amongst
none but wild Beasts: The vast Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Snow, with great difficulty they
remove, lest the Habitation should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed,
and if at any time they went
forth, their jawes were so benumed they
could scarce recover their former heat;
now the Bears in the dark, being dull of
sight did not venture out to disturbe
them, but multitudes of Foxes, which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49964:20"/>
they took in Traps, and made of them both
Victuals and Rayment; and yet after all
these dangers and difficultys God preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them,<note place="margin">This <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in his Annalls of the nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, gives an account of at large.</note> though indeed some of them

of them was one <hi>Iacob Hamskerk,</hi> who
returned afterwards to <hi>Amsterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. In the year 1616 a flemming named
<hi>Pickman,</hi> well known in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for the art he had in getting out of
the Sea, the great Guns of that <hi>Spanish</hi>
Fleet, that was forced upon the Coast of
<hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the year 1588.
coming from <hi>Dronthem</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> laden
with Boards, was overtaken by a Calm,
during which, the current of the Sea,
carryed him in a Rock or a little Island to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the extremity of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where
he was in some danger of being cast away;
to avoide a wrack, he commanded some of
his men to go into the shallop, and to tow
of the Ship: these having done so, would
needs go upon a certain Rock to seek for
eggs, but as soon as they were got up
into it, they espy'd a man, whence they
imagine there were others lay there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and that he had made an Escape
thither to avoid some Pirats which might
Surprize their Ship, so that they made all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49964:21"/>
the hast they could to the Shallop, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the Ship; but the Calme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing,
and the current of the Sea driving
the Vessel against the Island, they were
forced to get into the Long-boat and Tow
her off again; the man they saw before,
was in the mean time come to the brink
of the Island, and made signes to them
with his hands, entreating them to come
nearer; and falling on his Knees, and
joyning his Hands together, he beg'd
Relief from them; at last coming near
the Island, they saw somthing more like a
Ghost than a living Person, a body stark
Naked, black, hairy, of a meager and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Countenance, hollow and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storted
Eyes, which raised such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
in them, that they proffered to
take him into their Boat; at last with
some difficulty they took him in; they
found upon the Island no Grass nor Trees,
nothing for Food, nor any shelter, but the
ruins of a boat, wherewith he had made
himself an Hut, under which he might be
covered from Rain and injuries of the
Weather; when they came to ask him
who he was, and how he came into that
un-inhabited place, he replyed to them
he was an <hi>English</hi> Man, and that a
year before he was to go from <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49964:21"/>
to <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> in the Passage-Boat,
and that they were taken by a <hi>French</hi>-Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
who by a Storm that immediately
arose, was forced to let go the Passage-Boat;
left us to the mercy of the Waves,
which carryed us between <hi>Ireland</hi> and
<hi>Scotland</hi> into the main Sea, expecting to
be cast away every minute, as at last we
were: For the Bark being split against
the Rock, where you took me in, I esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with one of my Comrades into the
Island, in a more wretched condition than
if swallowed up by the Sea; who had been
delivered out of the Extremities we
were in for want of meat and drink; of
some of the boards of our Boat we made
a Hutt you saw, and we took some Sea-mews
which we set a drying in the Wind
and Sun, and so eat them raw; we found
also in the crevices of the Rock, by the
Sea-side, some Eggs: Thus were we kept
from starving; but what we thought most
insupportable, was Thirst; for there was
no Water, but what fell from Heaven;
we lived thus six weeks, comforting one
another, and finding some ease in our
common misfortune, till that being left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
it began to grow insupportable to
me; for one day, awaking in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and missing my Comrade, I fell into
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49964:22"/>
such a Despair, that I had some thought
of casting my self head-long, and so put a
final period to that Affliction, whereof I
had but endured the one half while I had a
Friend suffering with me: I know not
what became of him, but I am of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that he fell into the Sea, seeking
for Eggs; I left with him my Knife, with
which we kill'd the Sea-Doggs, and the
Mews, upon which we lived; so I was
forced to get out of my Hut a great Nail,
which I made a shift to sharpen upon the
Rock, that it served me for a Knife: I
was also forced to lade a little slake, with
a little Sea-dogg fat, and put it out of a
crevice of my Hut, and so got some Mews
to keep me from starving: I liv'd in this
condition and solitude Eleaven Moneths,
and was resolved to end my days in it,
when God sent you to deliver me out of
the greatest misery that ever man was in,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amlasa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels you find this Passage.</note>
and this Sea-man after this misery and
miraculous preservation, lived to return
to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Remarkable Providence of God in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
preserving of Eleaven or Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
poor distressed mens lives.</p>
            <p>11. In the year 68. a Ketch Sailed from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi>
in <hi>New-England</hi> for the <hi>Barbadoes;</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49964:22"/>
and when they came into the Latitude of
35. it began to look like foul weather, so
they took in their Top-sail, and because
it was towards night, they struck down
the Main sail, and Rafed it; and all this
time there was but a little wind (which
was remarkable, if the ensuing story be
observed) but still it looked like bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so they sent up one to Tallow the
Mast, and made no great hast to set Sayl;
the man at the Top thinks he sees some
black thing float upon the Sea, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon it very fixtly, he conceives it to
be a Boat, and so calls to the men below,
so they hasten'd to hoise Sayl and make
towards it; and when they came to them,
there was a Long-boat with a 11 or 13
men, (my Author could not absolutely
remember the just number) which poor
distressed Creatures, had been bound for
<hi>Virginia;</hi> and the ship in which they were,
proved very Leaky, and so exceedingly
encreased, that in a very little time, she
was ready to sink; so all hands hastened
to get out the boat, but the Master stept
into the Cabbin to fetch a Compass, and
took some Canvas, a Sayl-needle &amp; twine
which he thought might be useful to them
in their Need and Extremity; but while
this poor industrious man was endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49964:23"/>
to be useful to some other mens lives,
he was in danger to lose his own; for
the boat was put off, and the ship sinking,
so he crys to them in this distress, <hi>if they
would leave him, and let him there Perish;</hi>
so they came back, and took him in; they
had in their boat a Capstone-bar, which
they made use of for a Mast, and the piece
of Canvas for a Sayl, and so Sayled afore
the wind, and had no kind of Food; and
now comes dreadful and inexpressible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
upon them, making them wish for
death it self to give them a deliverance,
now all hopes of Relief failed them; thus
they continued five days, some grew
Lame, others Feeble, and all much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened
by despair of Life; and now
upon the 6th. day, they had concluded to
cast Lotts for their lives, who should dye
to preserve others; and they put their
Resolution into Execution, and that poor
Creature, upon whom the Lott fell, begs
for time; but alas, what will a Reprieve
be in this case, where there is no hope of
Relief; but O what difficult work is it to
dye? what a strait was here? Live he
could not, and Dye he could not; well,
a little time is defer'd, and behold a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-working
God appears now for him,
and for them all; before night, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spyed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49964:23"/>
this Ketch, which raised them all
to Admiration; but they had fears in this
distress, that the Ketch did not see them;
but when they perceived the Ketch made
to them, O what a new life did it put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these dying men; so they all got safe
Aboard: And see here the goodness of
God: In one hour after there arose a most
dreadful Storm which continued for forty
hours, and all of them safely Arrived at
<hi>Barbadoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Masters name of the Ketch was
<hi>Thomas Woodberry</hi> of <hi>Salom.</hi> This the
Author had from a very known person for
Integrity and Godliness, now living at
<hi>Salom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. In the year 1606. in the Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ocean, fell out this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
and remarkable action, taken
notice of by <hi>Grotius,</hi> in his Annals of the
Low-Country Wars. Admiral <hi>Hauteen</hi>
being sent to interrupt the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet,
coming from <hi>America</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> he
had with him four and twenty Vessels;
but of these, six were beaten back by
Tempests; soon after <hi>Frasciardo,</hi> with
eight great Gallions, having a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Gale, fell upon them unprovided,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49964:24"/>
and ere they were aware; but the Galleys
that were with him, not being driven by
the Wind, kept by the shore; but one of
them being grappled with a ship of <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that was next the Admiral, so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
the rest, that as soon as they saw
it, they in the very beginning of the
Night, Retreated with all hast. <hi>Hauteen</hi>
thus left by his Companions, being a man
of an Undaunted spirit, for two whole
days did not leave off the Fight, though
most of his men were in that time lost;
but with his torne ship, casting off all fear
of danger, protracted the Victory; but
after he saw no hopes of Relief, and that
the Waves poured in upon him, that none
of them might come alive into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
hands, at once they Unanimously
agreed upon a Resolute and Terrible
action: For kneeling down upon their
Knees, they like dying, but desperate
men, beg of God, that he would please to
pardon in that they sought to shun the
Mockeries and Cruelties of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
by that sad and lamentable death; so they
set fire to the Gun-powder, by which blow
threescore men were kill'd, two half dead,
lived a little while, being taken by the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> with wonder, beholding their
dreadful Countenances, and their words,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49964:24"/>
with their strange Resolution and Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
in death.</p>
            <p>33. In the year 1607. about the time
when the Plantations of <hi>Virginia</hi> began
to be a little settled by King <hi>Iames,</hi> some
<hi>Brittains</hi> went to <hi>Guyana,</hi> but a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Sedition arose in the Voyage, and
the ship being lost, part of the Company
remained in the Island, where continually
vexing the <hi>Barbarians</hi> with their unkind
usage, they at last were set upon by War,
as Enemies; by force of which, and the
want of Victuals, they committed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Sea in a boat made only of
an hollowed Tree; there these poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Creatures were tossed with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Tempests, betwixt Despair and Hope
of life; but at last they were droven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Rocks, after great misery endured
by them in their little boat for ten days
together; and now their danger was not
lessen'd, for here they must fall into the
hands of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who for all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
them, in regard they came not to
those parts of their own accord, but by
the stress of weather. Thus were these
poor distressed men saved and preserved,
when all hope of being saved was taken
away.</p>

to carry some persons of Quality

Captain sends the Long-boat Aboard, and
Ordered the Frigot to weigh and come to

and he would come out in his Pinnis; and
the Gentlemen that was with him, were
namely, <hi>Sunebank Giles</hi> his Chyrurgion,

near, being a good way a-head, waved
to the Frigot to keep her way, and not to
come a playse for her, which she did with
a fresh Top-sail Gail of Wind, till come
up with the Pinnis, and then the Coxen
would a-laid her Aboard of the Larboard-side;
but the Captain supposing himself
far enough A-head, Commanded him to

do, the ship giving a saw, and having fersh

of the ship cut the Pinnis in the
middle, and run right over, that she lay
in a moment of time in a 100 pieces, and
all the men floating for their lives; in the

gave a leap, in which leap, the Captain

catcht about one the others
heels or middle, as Boys when at play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Truss; and in hoysting in the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
they preserved 4 or 5 more with
him; the Coxen sank down, and brought
some of the Tallow of the Loward part of
the ship on his Cloaths, and came up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at the Stern, where was taken up the
Sea-men, some by swiming, others by the
assistance of the Oar and pieces of the
boat, by Gods blessing kept them from
drowning, till the Long-boat took them
all up, except the Captains Barber, Mr.
<hi>Perkins,</hi> whom it seems had sunk, its
thought his last time; but Providence so
ordered it, that the man in the main
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49964:26"/>
having the hand Lead, there fell a
chrockle in the dipsey Line, and in that
very intrim, the Lead fell in the very
place where the Barber was sunk, and
the chinckle of the Line fell about the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
Fingers, hitcht about his Ring, and
so Providentially fastened it self, so that
as the man in the Sceanes haleing up his
Lead, found it to come heavier than it
use to do; admiring, at last up comes
the Barber fastened in the chinckle by his
Ring, which the Spectators amazed at,
immediatly took hold of him, and pulled
him into the Frigot, but his Eyes fixed,
and Teeth set, and little apperance of
life; but by the blessing of God on the
immediate means used, and care of him,
he soon came to himself, and recovered
so, that notwithstanding this shroad dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster
which might have proved Fatal to
all, or most of them, yet there was not
one man of them all miscarryed, but was
recovered to their health again, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of Gods mercy. For truth of
this, many of the men are alive at this
day; the Chyrurgion now Living in
<hi>Grays-Inn-Lane;</hi> and at the very intrim
of time, I was then Aboard the said Frigot,
and was not only an Eye-Spectator, but
an instrument to help preserving of some
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49964:26"/>
of them, and therefore may Aver it to be
Truth.</p>

            </p>
            <p>15 About ten Years agoe in the Island
of <hi>Barbbados:</hi> There did arrive one Mr.
<hi>Iohn Blackleach</hi> (from new <hi>England</hi>) a
very honest man, who gave account that
in his then Voyage, his Son being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Vessel, and himself Merchant,
their men at <hi>Sea</hi> did Muttiny, at which
occasion he and his Son was forced to
stand on their Guard for some time,
casting his care on the Lord: But
whilest under this trouble; being in the
Long Reach in or near the Latitude of
<hi>Barbadoes,</hi> they all did see a great <hi>Ship</hi>
which stood toward them; and while
they were Looking on her to see how fast
she Came towards them (she being
pretty near) vanished away, which struck
the men with great fear, and made them
humble themselves to the Good old
Man, and Desired his Prayers for
them.</p>
            <p>16. In the month of <hi>November,</hi> 1669
the <hi>Ship</hi> Prosperous of <hi>Bristol,</hi> sailed from
thence, being bound for <hi>Galloway</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
but was forced into <hi>Bruts-Bay</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi>
where the <hi>Ship</hi> brake in peices, six per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49964:27"/>
being Drowned, others wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
cast on Shore and bruised: amongst
the Rest <hi>Iohn Denny</hi> (a Skinner of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol</hi>)
was Cast a Shore by a great <hi>Sea:</hi>
being much bruised and almost Dead:
and was by some stript naked and layd
amongst the other dead folk that were
taken up, being only covered with some
Straw or Rubbish. But by Providence, an
old Man Loking on the Dead People,
did perceive some Life in the said <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi>
and the Lord opened his heart that
he stript himself of his own Shirt and
some Cloaths, and put on him, and took
him from amongst the Dead: through
his Labour and Love, by Gods blessing,
the said <hi>Denny</hi> is now well and liveth
at <hi>Bristol.</hi> This my Author had from <hi>Iohn
Denny's</hi> own mouth.</p>
            <p>17. In the Year 1671. I being at <hi>Boston</hi>
in <hi>New-England,</hi> I oft went to see an
Acquaintance of mine one <hi>Abraham
Darby,</hi> a sober honest man a Master of
a Vessel, who relates the following Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which he attesteth to be Truth. That
That some few Years agoe he the said
<hi>Darby</hi> being master of a small <hi>Ketch,</hi>
was bound from <hi>Barbadoes</hi> to <hi>Virginia,</hi>
he having an Irish Woman a Servant on
Board to be Delivered in <hi>Virginia,</hi> but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49964:27"/>
she was a vile person, and having often of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
at last was punished, for which
she said they should not carry her to
<hi>Virginia,</hi> though the Wind was very
fair and carried them in sounding of the
<hi>Capps</hi> of <hi>Virginia:</hi> That they had bent
one Cable to the Anckor thinking soon
to get in; but she still said they should
not, then the Wind sprang up of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in a meer fret, which forced them
many days off, and their Provisions near
spent (it being if I mistake not in <hi>March</hi>)
then the Wind came fair again a fresh
Gaile, and they before it in hopes to gain
their passage; but on a sudden there
came a great <hi>Sea</hi> that cast the Vessel on her
side (she having but little beside Ballace
in her) that her goods and things in hold
shifteth. But it pleased God they clapt
the Helm a weather, and she wore, and all
hands as could in the hould brought her
to wrights, and the Wind continued
fair till they came near the place, that it
took them short before; and then took
them as before, that they were forced off
again for many Days; having then but
two or three peices of Beese and no
Bread, nor (I think) above a gallon of
fresh Water: But after some time the
Wind came fair, they makeing Sail to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49964:28"/>
get back, it being fine weather, there
came a great <hi>Sea</hi> and laid her down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and carried her Mast away, and a
part of the Partners that hould the Mast,
that as she lay on one side, the <hi>Sea</hi> rushed
in to her; but the Master with his Bed
and Rug stopt the force, till it pleased
God they had shifted the things in the
hould and brought her to rights again,
(now these poor Souls were left as a
Wrack in the Ocean, and neither Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
nor Drink, but strong Water and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
to help them) but finding a Spar or
Oars, in the hould, made shift to get
out a smal Sail (I had like to have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that whilst they had any Food, they
would have given this wicked Woman
a part, but she would not Eat any thing)
then it pleased God to send a fine Gale, and
they got on the Cost of <hi>New-England,</hi>
and sounding, found about forty Fathom
Water, and very calme; then they chopt
to an Ancker there, and that Night got
two or three Fish, wherewith they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed
there selves (but the Woman
would not Eat) but could get no more;
and finding a fine Gail, weighed
Ancker, and thought to have got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Cape-Cod,</hi> not being far of; but the
Wind came fresh against them, and drove
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49964:28"/>
them off again to <hi>Sea,</hi> and then t'was
calm; and about that time the Woman
had fasted about 21. Days, and yet
could Curse and Damne; and say she
should not goe Ashore; but that Night
the Master and some others being on the
Deck, spied a great black Thing Rise out
of the <hi>Sea,</hi> to their thinking, much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the <hi>Ketch,</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> being Light all
about, and the Woman in the Hould
made a great Noyse; and when she had
given a great Screach or Groan, This
Great black Thing Vanished, the water
seeming like Fire all round, and made a
great <hi>Sea</hi> and Noise: and when the men
came to their selves, they looking for the
Woman, found her Dead; and after they
had flung her over Board, they had a brave
Wind and Weather and got safe to <hi>Plim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18. At new <hi>England</hi> in the year 1671.
I spake with <hi>Iohn Grafting,</hi> of <hi>Salem,</hi> and
others of good repute, who told me not
long before, the said <hi>Grafting</hi> suffered
Ship wrack amongst the Leward Islands,
(the name of the place I forget) the Ship
or Ketch being broken to pieces, himself
and mate, and one or two were cast with
the Sea a shore amongst the Rocks most
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49964:29"/>
wonderfully, not knowing of each other,
tell by providence they met amongst the
Rocks, it being an Island without Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
(if I mistake not,) and they bruised;
yet the Lord provided for them in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
manner, and not only there, but in
their getting of that place, and bringing
them safe to their Friends and Relations
in <hi>Salem,</hi> in New-<hi>England;</hi> where praises
was returned to the Lord, who wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
preserves the Children of men I hope
this ere long will be inlarged from the
party himself.</p>
            <p>19. I being near acquainted with one <hi>Ief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fery
Howard,</hi> a Marriner, who is a man
of good repute, he told me as followeth;
That about Twelve or Fourteen years
since, he was coming through the City of
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> he was looking on the Street
Rivers, and spies something move on the
water; but looking earnestly saw it to
have Life, stepts in and got it out, and
found it to be a man child, only inrapt as
it came into the world from its mother:
and it was put to nurse, and now is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a fine Youth.</p>
            <p>20. At <hi>Bristoll,</hi> a place well known, not
many years agon a man fell into the River,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49964:29"/>
near about the marsh, and not being seen,
was carried down with the tide someway,
and I think, could not swim, but lay as
dead on the water driving with the tide,
but by providence, some being in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
going to work or coming from the
<hi>Lymekils:</hi> Being by the water side play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a Spannel, saw somthing floating,
flung in things to make the dog fetch
it; and the dog accordingly took hold of
the man by the cloaths, and brought him a
shore; and finding some symptoms of Life,
took care of him; and he came to Life, and
dwels in New-<hi>Bristol.</hi> This I had from
the Spectators.</p>
            <p>21. In the year 1671 one Mr. <hi>Savage,
Master</hi> of the Sociate Ketch bound from
<hi>Bristol</hi> to <hi>Boston</hi> in New-<hi>England,</hi> met
on the coast of <hi>N E.</hi> the Ship called the
<hi>George</hi> of <hi>Bristol,</hi> being in distress, spake
with them; the ship having sprang a leak,
their men tired and spent with Pumping;
the Master and all his Company went on
Board the Ketch with speed, and soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ship sunk.</p>
            <p>This I had from Mr. <hi>Savage</hi> and other
Passengers with him, who affirmed it to
be truth.</p>
            <p>

22. Captain <hi>Iohn Trankmore,</hi> Commander
of a Ship belonging to <hi>Apsom,</hi> near <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi>
in one of his Voyages of late years,
being at Sea in a dark night, and foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
fell foul of another ship unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly;
then not knowing what each other
was, but a Sea parting them again; in
the intrim, Captain <hi>Trankmores</hi> ship, shipt
a great Sea which washed the said <hi>Trank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
over-board; and another Sea, cast,
or hove him into the other ship, which
fell out to be an <hi>English</hi>-man, bound for
<hi>Plymouth:</hi> Thus in the dark, the Wind
and Sea parts the said ship, that without
having knowledge of each other, Captain
<hi>Trankmore</hi> concluding that his own ship
was foundred, and all his men Lost, and
God had wrought a wonder of mercy in
his Preservation; but so it fell out, that
one <hi>Samuel Snytal,</hi> who was his Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
had obtained such knowledge of the
Art of Navigation, and his Master being
gone, as they supposed drowned, being
washed over-board, was necessitated to
improve his skill, and by Gods blessing,
he carryed the ship safe home to <hi>Apsom,</hi>
where Arriving; although had made a
good Voyaye, yet the sorrow for the loss
of the Master, eat up all the Comforts and
Smiles of a Prosperous Voyage, otherwise
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49964:30"/>
would have made; but so Providence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that about the same time, or three
or four days after, the other ship Arrives
safe in <hi>Plymouth;</hi> where the said <hi>Trank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
Landed, very sorrowfull and deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
having (as he supposed) lost his ship
(wherein was deeply concerned as an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer
himself and all his Men) was
in the Morning walking on the Hope at
<hi>Plymouth</hi> very Dejectedly, he Providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
meets with one of his Executors, or
<hi>Apsom</hi> Neighbours, who looks him in the
Face with Astonishment, knowing him
well, and yet believing the Report of his
being dead, or lost, in amaze Salutes
him with these Expressions; <hi>What, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
Tankmore? who replyes, <hi>A poor
Captain; having lost my Ship richly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and after a good Voyage, with all
my men, not a soul saved but my self.</hi>
Whom by a Miracle God wrought Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for men (as before Recited) giving
the Gentleman his Neighbour an account
of the Providence towards him; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little pause, his Friend imbraces him,
and with admiring of the Providence, bids
him be of good heart, for his ship and all
his Company was well and safe Arrived
at <hi>Apsom;</hi> for his Man <hi>Samuel Snytal</hi> had
brought her safe home, and all the sorrow
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49964:31"/>
and cry there was for the loss of him.
Which reply, struck the said <hi>Trankmore</hi> in
as much amaze on the other hand, being
almost Credilous of truth, till his Friend
possitively affirming it, and then consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Mercy, saw, and was made
sensible there was no mercy too great for
God to work, and from them took heart,
recovering himself, went home rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
where found his expectation answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and a welcome gives to all persons
with him concerned.</p>
            <p>For the truth, I have heard it acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Captain <hi>Trankmore</hi>'s own mouth,
at my House in <hi>Bristol;</hi> and farther, the
same <hi>Snytal</hi> was my Predecessors Son, and
I have heard his Mother-in-law speak of
it to several, and hath affirmed it to me
for a truth.</p>
            <p>23. The <hi>Bristol</hi> Frigot, when Captain <hi>Fenn</hi>
was Commander, being in the Straits in
Chace of Captain <hi>Popoctiene,</hi> a Spanish
Knight of <hi>Malto,</hi> whom that time our
Squadren took and brought Prisoner to
the <hi>Tower;</hi> in pursuit of which Chace,
the Wind began to rise, the Captain
Commands presently to get the Top-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
sails abroad; and the Yards being not
then Aloaft, three men run up presently,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49964:31"/>
where one stood on the top of the Shroud,
under the main Top-mast-cross-trees, a
second stood a top of the Cross-trees, and
the other stood by the Top-gallant-mast
on the Cape, at the main Top-mast head;
all expediting their work in getting the
Top-gallant-sail abroad; at which time the
wind freshen'd, and carryed our Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top-mast
by the board; in which disaster,
the man that was lower-most, and least in
danger, fell over-board, and was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and the other two which was in
greatest danger, one of their names was
<hi>Roger Dennis,</hi> under the denomination
of a Quaker, instead of being bruis'd, and
their bones broaken all to pieces, which
the eye of Reason could not otherwise
imagine by such a fall; they both fell for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
upon the Bunt of the Main-course,
and one catches hold of the main Bunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,
and the other of the Leech-lines,
and slacke of a bowling, and so both comes
down to the Deck, and neither of them
in the least prejudiced.</p>
            <p>For the truth of this, my Author was
then Aboard the said Frigot, and was an
eye-witness of this Providence.</p>
            <p>24. An Account of two ships bound for
New-found-Land, from some part in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49964:32"/>
West of <hi>England,</hi> whom by distress of
Weather, lost Company; some days
after, being fair weather, one of the ships
sprang a leak, and foundred in the Sea,
where every Soul perished, except one
Old Man, who had lasht himself on the
main Hatch, and committed himself to
the mercy of the Sea and God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
where he was floating three days
and three nights; in which time, about
the middle of the second day, the Devil
assuming a Mare-maid, starts up before
him, and bids him be of good heart, for,
if he would but make a Contract with
him, he would ingage a deliverance for
him in 24 hours; the Old Man being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
it was the Devil, and doubtless,
having been a proving of his heart to
God, as the Circumstance of Providence
he was under, more immediatly called for,
found in himself a renewed strength
put into him, inabling him to hold up his
head, and looking the Tempter in the
Face; Replyes, <hi>Ah Satan, if thou can'st
prophesy deliverance for me; know, my God,
in whom I trust, will deliver me without thy
help; but however, know, I will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to thy wiles, therefore avoyd Satan, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd;</hi>
so immedately he Vanished, and
appeared no more to him: But so it fell
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49964:32"/>
out, the other ship being at that time in
the same parallel or Latitude, that night
the Cabben-Boy dreams a dream, that
such a ship their Confort was foundred,
and every Soul lost, except such an Old
Man, nameing his name, who was saved
on a piece of a ship, and floating in the
Sea; which dream, the Boy in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
confidently tells it to the Company
and his Master; at last, the Boy began to
shew more Confidence, affirming it, as
if it must be true; insomuch, received
some checks from his Master; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
at last, the Boy grew so restless,
that he, running up from one Mast to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
sometimes at Fore-top-mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and then on the Main-top-mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
looking abroad, that at last, crying
out aloud; <hi>Alow there, I see him, I see
him under our Lee-bow;</hi> thus confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirming it, some of the men stept up,
and spy'd something at a distance no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than a Crow to appearance, floating,
which advised the Master it, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
commanded the Helm to be born
up, and stood a-way to it; and when
come near, found it the Old Man as the
Boy said; so they hoyst out their Boat,
and took him in, who then was speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and almost spent; but by the care of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49964:33"/>
the Master and the Chyrurgion, and
God's Blessing, recovered, and gave a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
account of his misfortune, and yet
wonderful deliverance; together with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
Temptation as before recited; which
ship, in due time Arrived safe at her Port in
<hi>New-found-Land,</hi> where this man was
well Landed a-shore.</p>
            <p>For Confirmation I had this, and heard
it related at my Father's House in <hi>Salom</hi>
in <hi>New-England,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Iohn Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
a Merchant, who is a person of a
sober life and in fellowship there, who then
came from <hi>New-found-Land,</hi> and did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that he spake with the man himself,
whom God wrought this wonderful deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
for, he being then at <hi>New-found-Land,</hi>
when the said ship Arrived there,
and the man went first ashore.</p>
            <p>25. <hi>Anno Christi.</hi> 1630. <hi>May</hi> the first,
the <hi>Muscovy</hi> Marchants of <hi>London,</hi> sent a
ship called the <hi>Salutation</hi> of <hi>London</hi> for
<hi>Green-land,</hi> which arrived there in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the eleventh of <hi>Iune</hi> following, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with two other Ships, all which were
commanded by Captain <hi>William Goodler.</hi>
The Ship wherein the Captain was, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Bell-sound;</hi> This of the <hi>Salutation</hi>
at the <hi>Foreland:</hi> And the Captain mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49964:33"/>
with store of Whales, quickly made
a great Voyage, and so sent for the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation</hi>
to take in part of his Train-Oyl:
By the way as they went to him, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with cross Winds, the Master set
eight of his men on Shore to kill some
Venison, in a place where there used to
be good store. These men taking with
them a brace of Dogs, a Snaphance,
two Lances, and a Tinder-box, went
on shore, and that day, they laid Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
good Deer upon the ground: And
then being weary, and the Night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on, they betook themselves to rest,
intending the next day to make an end
of their hunting, and so to return to
their ships: But the next day proved
foggy, and there was much Ice between
the shore and the ship, and the wind
coming Southerly, the ship was fain to
stand so far off into the Sea to be clear
of the Ice, that they lost the sight of
her; and the weather growing thicker,
and thicker, they thought fit to hunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the shoar to <hi>Green-Harbour,</hi> and
there to stay aboard the ship, till their
own ship should come into the Port.</p>
            <p>In this passage they killed eight Deer
more, and so having laden their Shallop
with Venison, they kept on their course
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49964:34"/>
to <hi>Green Harbour:</hi> But when they came
thither, they found, to their great asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
that the ship was departed.
Being thus frustrated of their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and having but three days to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
expiration of their limitted time,
for their departure out of that Country,
they thought it their best course to make
all speed possible to <hi>Bell-Sound,</hi> to their
Captain; and lest delay should prove
dangerous, they lightned their Shallop by
lieving their Venifon over board into the
Sea: and so they hasted all they might,
and that night gat half way: But the dark
Fog increasing, they were forced to cove
in a point of Land till the next day at
Noon: At which time, the weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clearer, they hasted forward; but
having no Compass to direct their course
by, they wandred up and down so long,
till the ships were departed. This filled
them with fear and astonishment, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that neither Christian, nor Heathen
had ever Inhabited those desolate Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates:
Yea, they had heard that the
Merchants had endeavoured, with proffers
of great rewards, and of sufficient furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and provision of all things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to hire some to undertake to winter
in those parts, but could never meet with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49964:34"/>
that would adventure their lives to so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
an undertaking: They had heard
also that the company of <hi>Muscovy</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
had once procured the reprieve of
some Malefactors condemned to death
here in <hi>England,</hi> unto whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
pardon, together with rewards and
provision of Cloaths, Victuals, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
necessaries, if they would stay one
Winter there: But when they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and took a view of the desolateness
of the place, they conceived such horrour
and fear in their hearts, chose rather to
return for <hi>England,</hi> and there to satisfie
the Law with the loss of their lives, than
to stay in so desolate and darksom a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
They remembred also a more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Example of nine good and able men
left there formerly by the same Master
that had now left them, who all dyed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
upon the place; and whose bodies
were fearfully disfigured by the Savage
Bears, and Hungry Foxes, which are the
only Inhabitants of that comfortless Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
All which made them, like amazed
men, to stand one looking upon another,
every one fore-seeing the future calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
both of himself and of his fellowes:
and that which much encreased their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
was, their want of all necessary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49964:35"/>
for the life of man, having neither
Cloaths to keep them warm, and for shift,
nor food to prevent the miseries of cruel
famine, nor a house wherein to shroud
themselves from the extremity of cold.</p>
            <p>But after a space, knowing that delay
in extremities, is the mother of all danger,
they began to conceive hope out of the
depth of despair; and therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
together of the likeliest course for
their preservation in that place: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
upon the opportunity of the next
fair weather, to go to <hi>Green Harbour</hi> to
kill some Venison for part of their winter
provision, which accordingly they did,
but found not so many Deer as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
yet the first day they killed sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and four Bears to boot, which they
also intended to eat: The next day they
killed six Deer more, and as they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they killed six more: and then the
weather proving foul, and cold, they laded
their Shallop with the Deer and Bears;
and finding another Shallop left there, as
usually they do from year to year, they
laded it with Graves of Whales that had
been boiled there that year; and so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
themselves into those two Shallops,
they took the first opportunity of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Bell-Sound</hi> to their Tent, where they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49964:35"/>
intended to take up their rest for the
Winter.</p>
            <p>But in their passage, the night coming
on, and the wind blowing hard, they
were forced to stay in the mid'st way at
<hi>Bottel Cove</hi> for that night: There they
fastened their Shallops one to another,
and casting out their Anchor, they left
them riding in the <hi>Cove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here again, for the tryal of their
patience, and to teach them to relie more
upon God's Providence, than upon any
outward means of their own, this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
befel them: The wind blowing
hard into the Cove, and their Anchor
coming home, their Shallop sunk into the
Sea, and so wet all their Provision, and
some of it they found swimming up and
down by the shoar: The sight hereof,
wonderfully troubled them, to see the
best part of their Provision, the only hope
of their lives under God, in danger either
utterly to be lost, or to be spoiled by the
Sea-water, for which they had taken such
pains, and run so many adventures in the
getting of it: and in this their misery,
they saw but one remedy, and that was a
desperate one, <hi>viz.</hi> to run into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrote
Sea to their Shallops to save the
remainder of their Provisions, now ready
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49964:36"/>
to be washed away by the billows: This
they did, and by main force drew the
Shallops to the shore; then they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
by the Sea-side to gather up such of
their Provisions as was swimming up and
down: and when the weather proved
fair, they went on to <hi>Bell-sound:</hi> where
being arrived, they took out their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and viewed the great Tent which
was built of Timber and Boards, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with <hi>Flemish</hi> Tiles: The use of it
was for the Coopers to work and long in
whilst they made Cask for the putting up
of the Traine-Oyle; and they resolved to
build another smaller Tent within that
for their Habitations; and accordingly,
taking down a lesser Tent that stood near
to it, wherein the Landmen lay whilst
they made their Oyle, they fetched their
materials from thence, both Boards, Posts,
and Rafters, and from the Chimnies of
the Furnaces, they took a thousand
Bricks; they found also four Hogsheads
of Lime, which mingled with sand from
the shoar, made good morter; But the
weather was groan so extream cold, that
they were fain to make two fires on both
sides, to keep their morter from friezing;
then they raised a wall of one Brick thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against the inner planks of the side of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49964:36"/>
the Tent; but by that they had walled
two sides of their house, their Bricks fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so that they were forced to build the
other two sides of boards; which being
nailed on both sides the posts, they were
hollow between, which they filled up with
sand, that made it so tite, that the least
breath of aire could not possibly annoy
them. The length of their Tent was
twenty foot, and the breadth sixteen; their
Chimney was the breadth of a deal board,
and four foot high; they seiled it with
boards five or six times double, that no
wind could possible get through: The
door they made as close as they could, and
lined it with a bed that they found there,
which came over both the opening and
shutting of it: they made no Windows,
having no light but what came through
the Chimney: then set they up four Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,
quartering themselves two and two
in a Cabin; their Beds were the Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins
dryed, which was a warm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
lodging for them in their distress:
their next care was for firing, and finding
seven old Shallops which were unservice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
they brake them up, and stowed
them over the beams in the great Tent to
make it the warmer, and to keep the
Snow from driving through the Tiles into
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49964:37"/>
the Tent: and by this time the cold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
and scarce having any day at all,
they staved some empty Cask, and brake
two old coolers (wherein they cooled
their Oile) providing whatsoever firing
they could without prejudice to the next
years Voyage: yet considering the small
quantity of fuel, the extremity of cold,
and the long time of their aboad, they
husbanded it as thriftily as possibly they
could.</p>
            <p>Having thus fitted every thing in the
best manner they could, on the twelfth of
<hi>September,</hi> looking out into the Sound,
they espied two Sea-horses lying asleep on
a piece of Ice, whereupon, taking up an
old harping-iron, they hastned to them,
and first slew the old one, and then the
young; and so bringing them ashore,
they flaied them, roasted, and eat them.
Not long after they killed another; but
the nights and cold weather encreasing on
them, and they viewing their Provision,
found it too small by half; whereupon
they stinted themseves to one reasonable
meal a day, and agreed to fast <hi>Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi>
and <hi>Fridays,</hi> excepting from the
Graves or Fritters of the Whale (which
was a very loathsome meat) of which
they allowed themselves sufficient for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49964:37"/>
their present hunger: at which diet they
continued about three moneths.</p>
            <p>Having finished what ever they could
invent for their preservation; they found
that all their Cloaths and Shooes were
worn, and torn; to repair which, they
had this new devise; of Rope-yarn they
made thread, and of Whale-bones nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
to few their Cloaths withal: But
<hi>October</hi> the tenth, the nights being grown
very long, and the cold so violent, that
all the Sea was frozen over; and they
having now nothing to exercise their
minds upon, were troubled with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
imaginations: Sometimes they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed
their absence from their Wives
and Children, thinking what grief it
would be to them to hear of their miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:
then thought they of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and what a cutting corrasive it
would be to them to hear of their untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; being thus tormented in
their minds with fear, and grief, &amp; pinched
in their bodies with hunger, and cold, the
hideous monster of desperation presented
his ugliest shape unto them: But think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it not best to give way to grief and
fear, they doubled their prayers to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God for strength and patience in
their miseries, by whose assistance, they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49964:38"/>
shook off their former thoughts, and
cheared up themselves to use the best
means for their preservation.</p>
            <p>Then for the preservation of their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison,
and lengthening of their firing, they
thought best to roast every day half a
Deer, and to stow it in Hogsheds, which
accordingly they did, leaving so much
raw as would serve to roast every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day a quarter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when this
was over, they began again to think of
their ensuing misery, that in case God
should give them life, yet they were to
live as Banished men from all Company;
and as if their sorrows had been too little,
they presently found an encrease of it;
for their Whale-Fritters, after they had
been drenched in the Sea-water, lying close
together, were grown mouldy, and spoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and again surveighing their Bear, and
Venison, they sound that it would not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
them five meals a week, whereupon
they were fain to cut off one meale more;
so that for three moneths after, four days
in the week they fed upon the unsavory
mouldy Whale-Fritters, and the other
three they feasted with Bear and Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
But besides the want of meat, they
now began to want light, so that all their
Meals were Suppers: For, from the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49964:38"/>
of <hi>October,</hi> to the third of <hi>February,</hi>
they never saw the Sun so much as peep
above the Horizon: But the Moon, when
not obscured with Clouds, they always
saw shining as bright as in <hi>England:</hi> All
which darksome time, they could not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
tell when it should be day, and
when night.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of this darkness, they
sought some means to preserve light, and
finding a piece of sheet-lead, and some
Oyl in the Coopers Tent, and Rope-yarn,
they made a Lamp, which they kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
burning, which was a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to them in their extremity; yet their
wants and miseries were so many, and
great, that sometimes they brake forth
into impatient speeches against the causers
of them, but then their Consciences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
minded them of their own evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
and so they took it as a just hand of
God for their former wicked lives; or
that God intended to make them exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of his Mercy in their wonderful deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance:
Humbling themselves therefore
under the mighty hand of God, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
themselves in prayer two or three
times a day, which course they constantly
held all the time of their misery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:49964:39"/>
In the beginning of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> as the
days began to leng then, the cold began
to strengthen; which proceeded to that
extremity, that it raised blisters on their
flesh as if they had been burnt with fire,
and if at any time they touched Iron, it
would stick to their fingers like bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime:
If they went out a doors to fetch
in a little water, it would so pinch them,
that they were sore as if they had been
beaten. In the beginning of Winter,
with Pick-axes breaking the Ice daily,
they got some water on the Sea shore:
but after the tenth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> they had
none but snow water which they mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with hot Irons, which was their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Drink till the twentieth of <hi>May</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>By the last of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the days were
seven or eight hours long, and then view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their victuals again, they found that
it would not last above six weeks longer,
which made them fear further Famine;
but they had recourse to God, who
they knew, could supply them beyond
their hopes.</p>
            <p>Looking out on a bright day, they saw a
great she Bear with her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cub coming
towards their Tent, whereupon arming
themselves with their Lances, they went
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49964:39"/>
forth, and stayd her coming; she soon
cast her greedy Eyes upon them, and
hoping to devour them, hasted towards
them: But with their Lances they gave
her such an hearty welcome, that she
tumbled upon the ground, biting the
Snow for anger: the Cub seeing this,
escaped by flight: The weather was
so extream could, that they were fain
presently to retire into the Tent, and
having warmed themselves, they drew
in the dead Bear, wherewith they dined
merrily; and this Bear served them
twenty days: Onely this mischance
they had, eating her Liver, it made their
skins peel off; when she was spent,
they yet feared that their Venison would
not hold out till he Fleet came out of
<hi>England;</hi> but God sent many Bears to
their Tent, by times, at least forty,
whereof they killed seven; One of which
was exceeding great, at least six foot
high; so that their Food encreasing, they
kept not themselves to such short com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
but oft eat two or three meals a
Day, which much encreased their
strength.</p>
            <p>By this, the chearful days lengthened
so fast, that several sorts of Fowl resorted
thither. <hi>March</hi> 16th one of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiffs
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49964:40"/>
went abroad which they never saw
after; upon the coming of the Fowles,
the Foxes, which all winter had kept
their Burroughs under the Rocks, came
abroad to seek for their livings; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they set up Traps, which they bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the skin of these Fowls, by
which means they caught at times fifty
Foxes; all which they rosted, and found
to be good meat: then taking the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins,
laying the fleshy side upwards,
and making springs of Whale-bone,
they caught about sixty Fowls as big as
Pigeons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the first, the weather began to
be pretty warm, so that they went dayly
abroad to seek for Provision: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
they could find for many days, till
at length they met with abundance of
<hi>Willocks</hi> eggs; of which they carried
home thirty, intending the next day to
fetch one thousand more, but the day
proved so cold that they could not stir
out of their Tent. The same day there
came two ships of <hi>Hull</hi> into the Sound,
who knowing that some men had been
left there the year before, being very
desirous to know whether they were
dead or alive, the Master manned forth
a shallop to go as near the shore as they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49964:40"/>
could, and so over the Ice to the Tent:
When these men came neer the Tent, they
haled them with the usual word of the
Sea, crying <hi>Hey:</hi> to which one of them in
the Tent answered again <hi>Hoe;</hi> which sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
answer almost amazed them all: but
perceiving them to be the very men left
there, with joyful hearts they embraced
one another, and so coming into the
Tent, they shewed the <hi>Hull-Men</hi> the
curtesie of the House, giving them some
Venison which was roasted four months
before, and a cup of cold Water, which
for novelty sake, they kindly accepted
of them.</p>
            <p>After a little discourse, these eight men
resolved to leave their Tent, and to go
with them to their ship, where they were
welcom'd after the heartiest and kindest
<hi>English</hi> manner: and so they staid with
them till the <hi>London</hi> Fleet came, which
was three days after: At which time they
went aboard the Admiral, in which Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>William Goodler</hi> was, who made them
very welcome, and gave order that they
should have any thing that was in the
ship that might do them good: he gave
them Apparel also, to the value of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pounds. So that after fourteen days
refreshment, they grew all perfectly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49964:41"/>
well: But when some of them went to
their own Master that had left them there,
he fell foul upon them, calling them <hi>Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways,</hi>
with other harsh terms far enough
from the Civility of an honest man. Thus
they continued in the Fleet until the
twentieth of <hi>August,</hi> at which time, with
joyful hearts, they set sayl through the
foaming Ocean; and though somtimes
crossed with contrary winds, yet at last
they came safely to an Anchor in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of <hi>Thames:</hi> and the <hi>Muscovie</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
dealt very well by them.</p>
            <p>The names of these men, were <hi>William
Fakely</hi> Gunner: <hi>Edward Pelham</hi> Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Mate, that wrote this story. <hi>Iohn
Wise,</hi> and <hi>Robert Good-fellow,</hi> Sea-men;
<hi>Thomas Ayers,</hi> Whale-cutter: <hi>Henry
Bet,</hi> Cooper: <hi>Iohn Dawns,</hi> and <hi>Richard
Kellet,</hi> Land-men.</p>
            <p>26. <hi>Greenland,</hi> is a Country that lies very
far North-ward in seventy-seven De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and forty minutes: Its wonderful
Mountainous, which Mountains are all
the year long covered with Ice and Snow.
The plains in part are bare in Summer:
But their grows neither Tree nor Hearb
in it, except Scurvey-grass and Sorrel:
The Sea is as barren as the Land, affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49964:41"/>
no Fish but Whales, Sea-horses,
Seals, and some few small Fishes.</p>
            <p>27. In <hi>Iune</hi> 1668. the <hi>Peach-tree</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
a small Vessel of the Burthen of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
sixty Tuns, <hi>Edward Dixon</hi> Master,
came into the <hi>Downs,</hi> bound for <hi>Guinny</hi>
intending there to take in <hi>Negroes,</hi> and
to transport them to the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and
from thence to come for <hi>London,</hi> where
<hi>Iohn Watts,</hi> the son of <hi>Iohn Watts,</hi> of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
in the County of <hi>Kent</hi> Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
shipt himself with the consent of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Watts,</hi> publick Notary of <hi>Deal;</hi>
little dreading that his Nephew, being
not above eighteen years old, should meet
with such a calamitous Accident. The ship
had not been long in the <hi>Downs,</hi> but a fair
gale presenting, they suddenly hoisted
Sail, God's providence seeming to fill their
Sails with prosperous success; the first
place they touched at, was the Gold
Coast, where they staid not long, but sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to old <hi>Calabar,</hi> in the Bith of <hi>Guinny.</hi>
They entered a River, called the <hi>Cross</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
into <hi>Piratts</hi> Island. After they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in their <hi>Negroes,</hi> and ready to sail,
their Anchor being a peek, the Master
calls up the Boatswain and three men
more, whereof the relater was one, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49964:42"/>
commands them to look out the Copper
Barrs that were left, and carry them on
shore to try if they could sell them: the
Boatswain, with his small Company de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
that they might have Arms with
them, not believing the report of some
that informed them they were a harmless,
and innocent people: they took with
them three Musquets and a Pistol, and so
rowed towards the shore, but not far
from it, unhappily our Match fell into the
water, and the ship being faln down from
that narrow part of the River, nearer the
Sea, quite out of our sight, we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
what should be safest for us to do:
we were not willing to precipitate our
own Ruine, and were also ashamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to our ship before we had dispatched
what we were commanded to: at length
the Boatswain commanded the Relator,
<hi>Iohn Watts</hi> on shore, to the first house to
light our Match, which we recovered out
of the water, after it was extinct, which
he readily obeyed: but before he was
twenty Rods from the water-side, he was
seized on by two blacks (or rather Tawny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moors)
and by them haled above half a
mile up into the Country, and thrown
with great violence upon his belly, and so
compelled to lye till they stript him; and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49964:42"/>
more Company coming to them, they
were so eager for his poor Canvas appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
that some they tore off, others they
cut off, and with that several pieces of his
flesh, to his intolerable pain: with these
rags, they made little Childrens Aprons
to cover their Privities; Linnen and
Woolen being scarce there. The Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swain
seeing this, <hi>Iohn Watts</hi> was thus
carried away, was resolved with his other
two Companions to have him again, or
else to venture all their lives for him: They
arm themselves; but whilst they were
consulting what to do, whether to venture
on shore, or not, of a sudden they were
beset with about a dozen men in several
Canoes, but they valiantly maintained
their Boat about the space of three hours,
for after two of their three Musquets were
discharged, they defended themselves
with their Oars, and Boat-hooks. The
Boatswain received a mortal wound in his
Groin, and fell down in the Boat; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two adventured in the River, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
by swimming to escape the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless
hands of cruel Infidels; but the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi>
with their swift Chanoes soon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
them, and brought them on shore to
the place where the relater was. The
<hi>Negroes</hi> took out the Boatswain out of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49964:43"/>
the ships boat; and instead of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at all to preserve life which remained
in him, immediately they rob'd him of
it; one of them with a keen weapon cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off his head before his Companions
faces; and then they prepare for their
rare banquet, while he was yet reeking in
his blood: they in a barbarous manner
cutting off pieces of flesh from off his But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks,
and his Thighs, and his Arms, and
Shoulders, and broiled them on the coals,
and with a great deal of impatience, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
eat it before their faces, to our great
astonishment. About fourteen days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
one of the Company fell sick, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of being Physicians to cure him, they
were his Butchers to murther him. They
served him as they did the Boatswain, cut
off his head, and broiled and eat up his
flesh, and rejoyced exceedingly at this
rich Banquet. About ten days after, the
third fell sick, whom they served in the
same manner.</p>
            <p>This was no small cause of sorrow to the
Relater; the thoughts of their Inhumane
and Barbarous actions sometimes sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
him with fears and sorrows,
hourly expecting to tast of the said Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.
Death did not seem so terrible to
him, as the violent manner of it; being
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49964:43"/>
left now alone, in a strange Country, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of friends or acquaintance, or any
thing that might keep up his Spirits: dye
he would fain, but not by the hand of
Infidels and barbarous Monsters. But
the great God that is most compassionate
in the greatest extremities had pity on
him, and notwithstanding the alteration
of the Climate, and the want of Cloaths,
and the strangeness of his food, which was
only herbs, he continued in good health,
and had time enough to lament this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
providence. The Natives who were
daily expecting another banquet, met
with a disappointment: either their
customs, or the over-ruling power of
God would not suffer them to destroy
him; he continuing still in health. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they resolve to sell him: his <hi>Arannia,</hi>
or Master, was pretty free to discourse
him, which the Relater was capable of,
being about three years before in the
<hi>West-Indies,</hi> where he had learned the
<hi>Tata</hi> language, which is easily attained,
being comprehended in a very few
words, and all the <hi>Negroes</hi> speak of it. He
began to discourse his Master, to know
the reason of their Cruelty, who told
him that he should rest himself contented,
who if he were not sick, should not have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49964:44"/>
his head cut off. In the Boat, which in
the beginning they took with them, was
a Musquet saved of the three which was
not discharged; which his Master some
time after he had been with him, brought
to him to know the use of it: he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
as much as he could to make him
apprehend the use of it, but still they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
their ignorance: but they command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and threatned him to shew the use of
it. The fear of his masters displeasure
and their inhumanity, caused him to shoot
it off; but the <hi>Negroes,</hi> which expected
some delightful thing, were frustrated,
and at the suddain noise and flash of fire
(which they very much dread) ran from
him, and were greatly affrighted; but
quickly after, hearing no more of that
noise, they came up to him again, and
commanded him to do the like: he told
them he had not powder, which was the
cause of the noise; but this would not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
these Barbarians. He not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to answer their expectation, they
concluded he was not willing, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to threaten him, and were about to
murder him, had nor his master rescued
him. Upon discourse after with this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,</hi>
or Master, he began to understand
the reason of their barbarous dealing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49964:44"/>
with him and his Friends, he telling him
that naturally the people were civil and
simply honest, but if provoked, full of
revenge; and that this Cruelty was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by some unhandsome action of
carrying a Native away without their
leave, about a year before; they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
if any came ashore, they should
never go off alive. He had not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
seven weeks in the Country, but his
Master presented him to his King, whose
name was <hi>E-fn-me,</hi> King of the <hi>Burka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores,</hi>
who immediately gave him to his
Daughter, whose name was <hi>Oni-jah,</hi> and
when the King went abroad, he attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him also as his Page, throughout the
whole Circuit of his Dominions; which
was not above twelve miles, yet boasting
extremely of his power and strength, but
glorifying exceedingly that he had a
white to attend him, whom he employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to carry his Bow and Arrows at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places remote from the Sea-side; the
people would run away from him for
fear, others would fall down and seem to
worship him, and use those actions as
they do to their God. Their progress
was never so long, but they could return
home at night, but never without a hand
some load of a cup of the Creature. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49964:45"/>
all the time of the Relaters servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
there, he never knew him g abroad
and come home sober. They drink of
the best Palm Wine, and another sort of
strong liquor, called <hi>Penrore.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator
quickly knew how to humour this
profound Prince, and if any of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
abused him, upon his complaint he
had redress, as once by striving with a
<hi>Negroe,</hi> his arm was broke, which by
providence, more than skill, was set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
After some moneths, the King of
<hi>Ca-la-nanch,</hi> whose name was <hi>E-fn-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi>
hearing of this beautiful white,
courted his Neighbour Prince, that he
would sell him to him; at length they
struck a bargain, and the Relater was
sold for a Cow and a Goat; this King
was a very sober and moderate person,
free from treacheries and mischiefs, that
the other was subject unto; and he would
often discourse the Relater, and ask him
of his King and Country, and if his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Dominions were as big as his,
which were not above twenty-five miles
in length, and fifteen in breadth. He
told him as much as his understanding and
years made him capable of, keeping still
in the bounds of modesty, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
as much as possible to the honour
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49964:45"/>
and dignity of his Soveraign; first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
him of the greatness of one of his
Kingdoms, the several Shires and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
it contained, with number of its Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Towns and Castles, and the strength
of each, the infinite Inhabitants, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of his Subjects. One of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
was enough to amaze sufficiently
this petty Governour, that he need not
to mention any more of his Majesties
Glory and Dignity. It put him into such
a profound consternation, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to find out some way to tender his
respects to this mighty Prince, and no way
could he find so convenient, as to tell the
Relater, that if he could find but a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
he would let him go to <hi>England,</hi>
to tell his Majesty of the great favour and
respect he had for him. This did not a
little rejoyce our English-man. Withal
the King told him, that he would send
him a Present, which should be two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bareets
or Goats, which they do value at
a very high rate; the King having not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
16 or 18. He tells the King, that
the King of <hi>England</hi> had many thousands
of his Subjects that were under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Gentlemen, which had a thousand
of Sheep a piece; the flesh of which, they
valued at a very much higher rate than
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49964:46"/>
Goats. Though our English-man lived
very handsomely with this <hi>E-fn-man-cha,</hi>
King of the <hi>Ca-la-nanch,</hi> yet his desires
and his hopes were still for his Native
Country: at length he obtained a promise
from his King, that the first English ship
that came into the Road, should have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to Release or Purchase him; this
very much rejoyced his heart: now he
thought every day a year, till he could
hear of, or see some English ship arrived.
Many times when he was alone, his heart
would be opprest with sighs and sob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings,
when he thought of his Relations,
and the comfortable society that they had
together; that it should be his sad lot
to be captivated amongst barbarous
Infidels. Oftentimes did he walk down
to the Sea-side, sometimes with hopes,
sometimes with fear, earnestly expecting
the wind of Gods providence to blow in
some English Ship thither: his often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the Sea-side was discerned by
one <hi>Ia-ga,</hi> a Wizard, and the chiefest in
three or four Kingdoms there-abouts;
they are persons that the Natives give
very much credit to, and on any difficult
occasion, run to them for satisfaction.
That famous Delphean Oracle was never
had in greater adoration, than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49964:46"/>
speeches of these Morish Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards.
Though they have infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of them in every place, yet this
<hi>Ia-ga</hi> had the most renown amongst
them; and one day he comes to him, and
very kindly ask'd him why he so very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
frequented that place; he told him,
to see if he could discover any English
Vessel to come in there: but he being not
acquainted with his great fame, askt him
when he did believe there would one
come in, not that he was willing to give
credit to any of their divinations, but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that he thereby should please him
and answer his expectation. <hi>Ia-ga</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
told him, that the fifteenth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an English Ship should come into the
Road. Then he askt him whether that
Ship should carry him away. To this he
answered doubtfully, but told him that he
should be offered to the Master of the
Ship, and if they could not agree, but that
he should come to shore again, he should
not be sold, and that in a very short time
after he should dye for grief. These fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
days seem'd very long and tedious;
many a look did he cast on the Sea with
an aking heart: the fourteenth day he
went to the highest hill there-about, but
to no purpose, for he could discover no
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49964:47"/>
Ship: next morning he went again two
or three times, but saw none: about two
or three hours after came running into
<hi>E-fn-man cha,</hi> some of the Mores, and
told him there was a Canoe coming, so
they called our Ships; at which our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-man
heartily rejoyced, hoping then
to be releast forthwith, yet durst not shew
his joy for fear of punishment or of death;
for though he lived better now than with
his first Master, yet his service was far
worse than the Slaves in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and their
Diet worse than Dogs meat; therefore
had he cause enough of inward joy; the
Ship came immediately in, and he highs
away presently to <hi>Ia-ga,</hi> to know if it
were an English Ship, who resolved him
that it was; it happened to be the St.
<hi>Maloes</hi> Merchant, Captain <hi>Royden</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
who hastened to dispatch his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
took in his Negroes, and was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to sail, and our English-man heard ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a word what should become of him,
the King never offering to sell him; this
put him on a resolution to endeavour to
make an escape, and to that end had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
a piece of Timber which he had
drawn near the water-side, on which he
intended to paddle to the Ship, which then
lay about a League from the Shore. Just
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49964:47"/>
by the Sea-side, as he was about to launch
his little floating stick, he espied a great
Aligator, which will devour a man at a
mouthful; this made him alter his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and resolve rather to live with
inhumane Infidels, than to throw himself
into so imminent a danger, which would
have been little less than self-murther.
But the next day, which I may call a day
of <hi>Imbile,</hi> Almighty God opened the
heart of the King to let the poor English
man go: he sent him in a Canoe, placed
between a Negroe's legs, with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to guide this small vessel, for fear
he should leap over board &amp; swim to the
ship. At a distance from the ship he hailed
her in the English Tongue, which was no
small cause of admiration to those on
board to hear an English Tongue out of
their Canoes: the Negroes gave him
leave to stand up and shew himself to the
Captain, to whom he gave an account
how four were left there, and only he
perserved. It was a pretty while before
they could strike a bargain, though the
Captain was resolved not to leave him
behind. Several times the Negroes pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
away with their Canoe, resolving not
to part with him; but what with his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
and promises, he perswaded them
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49964:48"/>
to the ship again, and they delivered him
on board for forty five Copper Bars and
Iron bars; each Copper bar being about
the bigness of a Youths little finger, the
Iron bars a little bigger. Now were his
joys compleated, he thought himself, as
it were, caught up into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
he could hardly perswade himself
but it was a Dream or Vision, and that he
did not really see English faces, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
English bodies. It was some time
before he could throw himself at the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
feet, and acknowledge his infinite
cause of joy in himself, and thankfulness
to him for his deliverance from such a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Captivity; that he that lately was a
slave to Infidels, that worship they know
not what, should now see the faces of
Christians, and join with them in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping
the true God; and to him first he
offered up the sacrifice of hearty thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
that had sent his Angel to redeem
him from so cruel a bondage. When he
came on board, his hair was very long,
and his skin tawny (<hi>Malatto</hi> like) having
gone naked all the time he was there, and
frequently anointing himself with palm
Oyl he looked like a Tawny-More; but
immediately the Sea-men aboard with
Christian-like hearts, apparelled him. The
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49964:48"/>
Master commanded to hoise sail, and
having a fair wind, they sailed to <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi>
where Captain <hi>Royden</hi> was to tarry
some time; but the Relater earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to go to his Native Country, and
his Relations, got passage to the <hi>Downs</hi>
in the <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Captain
<hi>South</hi> Commander, which through Gods
goodness in a few weeks arrived in the
<hi>Downs,</hi> where the Relater was put on
shore to his Unkle, Mr. <hi>Richard Watts</hi> of
<hi>Deal,</hi> his great joy and satisfaction, who
took this relation from his own mouth.</p>

the Ship.</p>

                  <p>20. And when neither Sun nor Stars

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Chapter we have a full Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of <hi>Pauls</hi> Voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> in all
the circumstances of it; it seems <hi>Paul</hi>
kept a Journal, and so Recorded this
memorable Voyage for the use of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Generations. 1. We have the
occasion of his Voyage, (<hi>Viz.) Paul</hi>
being then a Sufferer and a Prisoner, he
appeals to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and so is sent to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and there bears a faithful Testimony for
Jesus Christ, (<hi>Vers.</hi> 1.) 2. We have the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49964:50"/>
Dangers that occurred in the Voyage,
and these are also carefully Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morated
(<hi>vers.</hi> 9.) Now much time was
spent, and Sailing was now dangerous,
because the Fast was already past:<note place="margin">Lev. 16 29.</note> This
was the yearly Fast of the <hi>Iews,</hi> on
which the attonement for all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was made by the high Priest, in the
holy of holies; which day was the 10.
of the 7th Month, which partly agreed
with our <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> in which
time the Sea was not Sailed in, by the
Ancients, until the beginning of <hi>March,</hi>
because of the shortness of the days, and
the violence of the Tempests, they were
prone to in those Parts, this is the sense
of Interpreters upon the place. 1. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the Voyage we read of, is this,
the winds were contrary, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. this is
spoken of the Voyage of the Disciples,
The winds were contrary. 2. Danger,
there arose not only a contrary wind,
but a violent wind, called an <hi>Euroclydon,
(vers.</hi> 14.) some read it a Whirle-wind,
but it is meant of an <hi>East</hi>-wind, which
raises the Sea mightily. 3. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
was so great and violent upon
them, that they were glad to let the
Ship drive, (<hi>vers</hi> 15.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:49964:50"/>
3. We have not only the, Danger in
this Voyage, but their marvelous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
and Preservation; for they
came off all of them with their lives,
(<hi>vers.</hi> 44.) the particulars whereof you
may see.</p>
            <p>In the Text we have three things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable.
1. Their endeavors in this
great distress to preserve themselves.
1. They lightned the Ship; and what was
it she was laden with? it was Wheat,
<hi>vers.</hi> 38. They lightned the Ship, and
cast the Wheat into the Sea; thus did
<hi>Ionah</hi>'s Mariners cast out the Wares.
Alas, what are these things, but lumber
to lives? if it were Gold, it must go for
Life. <hi>Skin for skin and all that a man hath
will be give for his life.</hi> Then what should
a man give for his Soul? what will a
man give in exchange for his Soul?
2. Endeavor; they cast out the Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of their Ship; any thing they part
with to save their lives, though never
so useful to them; even that which was
necessary for their Voyage, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a necessity to part with it, for the
preservation of their lives.</p>
            <p>2. We have their Dangers as well as
Endeavors. 1. It is exprest in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Tempest; they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49964:51"/>
tossed with a Tempest. 2. It
was dark weather, neither Sun nor Stars
appeared, which used to be great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and helps to poor men at Sea.
3. Their Danger is exprest in this, they
were brought to the brink of the black
pit of Despair; all Hope now was taken
away. O what a sad distressed condition
was this! their Hope, which is called
the Anchor of the Soul, yea which is
the Sheet-Anchor of the Soul, was lost;
they gave all their lives over for gone
and lost: And oh, what could now a
company of men do that had lost their
Hopes and Hearts?<note place="margin">Ezek. 37. 11.</note> could these that had
lost their Hopes find their hands? they
were now saying, as the Jews did in
their Captivity, Our Hope is lost, we
are cut off for our parts.</p>
            <p>3. We have their Deliverance and
Preservation, coming in at such a time
and season as this was; now that they
are brought to an extremity, God
makes it his opportunity; and now
that all hope of being saved is taken
away, salvation will be most seasonable:
and now the Angel appears to <hi>Paul,</hi> and
tells him, all their lives are ensured,
only the ship shall be lost.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:49964:51"/>
Observations are these:</p>
            <p>1. Dangers and Deliverances are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
recorded and remembred; therefore
<hi>Paul</hi> takes an account of both, here in
this Voyage.</p>
            <p>2. Salvations and Deliverances many times
are not sent, until persons be left hopeless
in themselves.</p>
            <p>I shall speak a little to both these
upon this present occasion, that what
you read here, may be remarked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
            <p>1. Dangers and Deliverances are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
recorded and remembred. This Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
hath two parts: 1. Dangers
are to be remembred. 2. Deliverances
are to be remembred.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lords poor people used to
do in all Ages: When <hi>Iacob</hi> was in danger
of his Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> you see how he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorates
it, and gives us an exact
narrative of it, and tells us how he
feared him: <hi>Lord, I fear my Brother</hi> Esau.
How often was <hi>David</hi> in danger by <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 34. 4.</note>
who was his sworn Enemy? and how
many Psalms have we, taking occasion to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49964:52"/>
remember what danger he was in, and
how comfortably he was brought off:
<hi>I sought the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>and he heard me; and
delivered me out of all my fears.</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi>
tells the Corinthians what danger they
were in; they were prest out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
out of strength, in so much that
they despaired of life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so at
Sea as well as Land, he would have
dangers remembred; how that they
go up to the Heaven one while, and sink
into the deeps another; their Soul
melted because of trouble, and they
at their wits ends,<note place="margin">Matth. 14. 28, 29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c. Peter's</hi> danger
at Sea is recorded, when he began to
sink, and cried out, Master, save me, or
I perish: And the Disciples, when they
cried out, <hi>Carest thou not that we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish?
(Mark 4. 38.)</hi> It is observed the
Ship now was full, and now comes sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and deliverance. Here was their
danger recorded, the Ship was full, and
Christ asleep in the hinder part of the
Ship.</p>
            <p>1. Query is, How Dangers should be
remembred?</p>
            <p>2. How Deliverances should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred?</p>
            <p>1. Dangers should be remembred,
considering we may come into them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49964:52"/>
Many when dangers are not, they
sing to their Souls that song, and delude
themselves, The bitterness of Death is
past; they think they are out of one
storm, and they shall never come in such
another. Just as persons do with their
Sickness at Land, so many do with their
Dangers at Sea, if God bring them off:
O they grow hardned and secure again.
But if God hath brought home one
dangerous Voyage, we should think, it
may be the next will be as dangerous;
Have I escaped one at Sea, one at Land?
if I do not improve it, if I do not walk
suitable under it, O how easily can God
bring me into another. You never
were in such Dangers, but you may
come to the like again, whether at Sea
or Land.</p>
            <p>2. Dangers should be remembred with
consideration to the greatness of them;
great things should be remembred, a
great God, great Mercies, great Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances,
great Sins, and great Dangers.
How should we think, O what a Danger
was I in at this time by such a Storm at
Sea! by such a Sickness ashore not only
my Life in danger, but Lord, was not
my Soul in danger? was I fit to die at
such a time? had I gotten an interest in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49964:53"/>
Christ, if I had been cast away at such a
a time? Men think dangers great for
their Bodies, but they do not think
them so for their Souls; they think
them great for their Ships, for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
but they do not think them so
for their Eternal conditions; O, had not
my Body, Soul, Ship, and all perished to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
And was not this a great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?
thy Souls danger was the greatest
danger; hadst thou been drowned at
such a time, thy Soul had been ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt
to all eternity.</p>
            <p>3. Dangers should be remembred
with consideration to their suddenness;
how many times do they come suddenly
upon us? As there is sudden fear, so
there is sudden danger. When the Lord
sends the Winds out of his Treasury
suddenly, and threatens men at Sea with
sudden destruction, when desolation
seems to come as a Whirl-wind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we
should think, What if sudden death had
come upon me, what a condition was
my poor Soul in? what a dreadful thing
would it have been if I had been sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
on a sudden, and sent into an
Eternal condition, in the twinkling of
an eye? I, to be threatned to be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up, only with a formal God have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49964:53"/>
mercy upon thee in thy mouth; not to
have time to pray, repent, reflect upon
thy past life: O what a sad thing is
this?</p>
            <p>4. We should think of our Dangers
with consideration to the frames of
hearts; what frames of heart we were
then under. 1. To the frames of our
hearts when in our dangers. 2. The
frames of our hearts when brought from
under them. 1. The frames of heart when
in and under them: were not you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
great fears and hurries of Soul? it
may be, not knowing how it would go
with your Souls, if you had gone off
the stage of this life at the present. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
when he was in danger, took espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
notice of the frame of his spirit;
<hi>Innumerable evils have compassed me about.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 40. 12, 13.</note>
He was compassed about on every side
with danger; and how was it with him
then?<note place="margin">Psal. 57. 7.</note> he calls to mind, <hi>Mine iniquities
have taken bold upon me, so that I am not
able to look up.</hi> And what then? O see
how he prays; <hi>Be pleased, O Lord, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me; O Lord, make haste to help me.</hi>
Remember what the frames of our
hearts were in our dangers, in reference
to our fears; and secondly, what in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to our faith; so also did <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:49964:54"/>
when pursued in danger by <hi>Saul. My
heart is fixed, my heart is fixed; I will sing
and give praise.</hi> We are to remember
our fears under our dangers, that we
may be prepared better for future try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
we are to remember our faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
dangers past, that we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
for the time to come in after
straits.</p>
            <p>2. We are to remember our frames
of spirit when God brings us out of our
dangers; how then we were melted
with the present sense of the mercy;
as those Israelites, when God brought
them out of danger, they believed
God, they sang and gave praise; O what
resolutions were there then upon the
Soul to be given up anew to God; to
walk before the Lord in the light of the
living. Thus also did <hi>David,</hi> when
brought out of danger; <hi>Thy vows are
upon me, O God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 56. 12, 13.</note> &amp;c. and at another time,
<hi>The Lord preserveth the simple: I was brought
low,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and thou helpedst me.</hi> And then
what a frame of heart was upon him?
<hi>Return unto thy rest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 116. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>O my Soul,</hi> &amp;c. Then
he was all for returning to God: O now
there was fresh endearments betwixt
the Soul and God. These we are to
remember, that we may not wear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49964:54"/>
the sense of them off our spirits.</p>
            <p>5. We should remember our dangers,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 26.</note>
with consideration, to the frequency of
them; how frequently we were in
them. <hi>Paul</hi> remembred this, in Perills
by Sea often, in Perils by the Heathen,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> O how often have we been near
Drowning, near Taking, near Sinking,
near Dying, and yet God brought us
off; these things we should call to
mind often; go out upon dangerous
Voyages, and often come home; the
oftner and more frequent our dangers,
the more should we think upon them.</p>
            <p>2. We should Remember our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances,
but how? 1. We should Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them, admiring them; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them, so as to admire them;
thus did the people of the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Ezra,
Who hath given them such deliverance as
this?</hi> O! they admire it, and write a
Non-such upon the Head of it,<note place="margin">2 Sam. <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
admired the goodness of God, when
he had spoken of his House to come.
Is this the manner of men, O God? He
was in an holy Extasy of Heavenly-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;
so should you say now; to
carry out, and bring home, in such a
dangerous time as this; To hide from
Enemies, when sought for in such a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49964:55"/>
time such a Voyage as this: Oh! <hi>who
am I? and what is my Fathers house, that
be should bring me hitherto?</hi> You should
turn the Deliverance on every side, and
admire the goodness of God, the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, the mercy of God, the
power of God, the faithfulness of God
in it, and say, O Lord, what a Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is this? what a Voyage is this?
God loves to have his Mercies admired
by us.</p>
            <p>2. We should Remember our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
to have our Hearts raised up in
gratitude, and thankfulness to God for
them; Thus did <hi>David, I will pay my
Vows unto the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 116. 12, 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>in presence of all his
people: I will take the Cup of Salvation, and
call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> We are
to remember to pay our Thank-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
unto God, after our Deliverance
from God: what, forget such a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
as this? what; not be thankful
for such a Preservation as this?</p>
            <p>3. We should Remember our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances,
so as to endear our Hearts to
God; Thus we find <hi>David, I will love
thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 1.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord, I will love the Lord dearly,</hi>
(so the Heb.) <hi>The Lord is my Rock, my
Fortress, and my Deliverer,</hi> &amp;c. O! now
how should Souls after their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49964:55"/>
boile, and burn in Love to God!
How are we engaged to a Friend that
is at any time but an Instrument in
Gods hand to Deliver us? and shall we
be endeared to the Instrument, and not
to the Author? O! how was <hi>David</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared
to God, when he said,<note place="margin">Psal. 56. ult.</note> 
               <hi>He having
Redeemed him, he would walk before the
Lord in the Land of the Living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. We should Remember our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances
to improve them in a way of
acting Faith, when the next danger and
straits comes:<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>I will remember thee from
the Land of Iordan, from the Hill</hi> Missar.
This was to encourage him from his
former Deliverances in his future straits
and exigencies. What, now distrust
God, who hath delivered in six troubles,
and now shall we give way to unbelief
in the seventh. Did not holy <hi>David</hi>
thus? <hi>He hath delivered me out of the Paw
of the Lyon, and out of the Paw of the Bear,
and he will deliver me out of the hand of the
uncircumcised Philistine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 17, 18.</note> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rembers
his Deliverance from <hi>Nero.
And I was delivered out of the mouth of the
Lyon, and the Lord shall deliver me from
every evil work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. We should remember our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
to be often inculcating, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49964:56"/>
them upon our own hearts
alas, when we receive them, they are a
little fresh it may be upon our spirits,
but ô how soon do they die, because
they are not written upon our hearts;
they are not engraven their as a man
that would Remember a thing, be it a
Notion, or any Resolution, he will be
often turning it over in his thoughts;
alas, if we write our Deliverances, is it
not in the Dust? whereas we should
write them in Marble: We should
write them them with a Pen of Iron, and
the point of a Diamond.</p>
            <p>1. We should Commemorate our
Dangers with our Deliverances, because
God gives them to that end. The Lord
doth not give us our Deliverances to
cast them at our heels, nor brings us
out of our Dangers, that we might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
them, as though we never had been
in any of them. God expects that we
should faithfully Register and Record
them; therefore it was a great Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to the Lord, that the Children of
<hi>Israel</hi> so soon forgot his works: If you
do but forget the kindness of a Friend,
you think it is disingenious; but ô
then, what is it to forget that God that
hath delivered you out of six troubles,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49964:56"/>
and in seven troubles? God loves and
expects his kindness should be kept up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Record.</p>
            <p>2. We should Commemorate our
Dangers and Deliverances, because it
was freely of his grace to bring us out
of the one, and put us under the other;
is it not of his meer mercy that he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued
and pull'd us out of our dangers?
might not we else been swallowed up
of them, and may not we all say in this
case, as the Psalmist in that?<note place="margin">Psal. 124. 4, 5.</note> had it not
been the Lord, who was on our side
then, the waters had over whelmed us,
the stream had gone over our Soul, then
the proud Waves had gone over our
Soul: may not you sing this Song?<note place="margin">Who have been so often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at Sea in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent dangers.</note>
what, and now forget such dangers?
and cast behind your backs such Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances.
Oh! the freer any favour is,
the more it should be remembred;
doth God see any thing in us, or in our
families, more then others, to bestow
such deliverances for? One man goes
to Sea, and he is taken; another goes
to Sea, and he is sunk; another goes to
Sea, and he dies the Term of the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
and why doth the Lord preserve
you? is not this free grace? not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you are more Righteous, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49964:57"/>
he is more gracious; and should
not this be Remembred?</p>
            <p>3. Our Dangers and Deliverances
should be remembred, because God hath
gracious ends and designs both in the
one and the other; What ends hath
God to bring us into dangers? 1. He
by this hath an end and design to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up to duty; it may be there may
be some omitted duty, neglected duties
often bring men into great and eminent
dangers; it may be a Person is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the duty of Prayer, but it may
be neglected; oh then God will bring
into danger to quicken to duty; oh
says God, <hi>In their Afflictions they will seek
me early.</hi> The very Heathen Marriners
called out for Prayer in time of danger.
Observe it, that Persons convinced of
duties, either Personal or Domestical,
and yet neglected, God usually whips
them to their duties, by one danger,
affliction or another. The Proverb is
good, if you would teach a man to pray,
send him to Sea. 2. God by bringing
us into dangers, hath a design upon us
to convince of sin; many Convictions
hath come in to the Soul at this door;
Dangers have often proved inlets to
Convictions. Oh! what Convictions
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49964:57"/>
have many poor Souls lyen under while
in Danger, when it may be the Dangers
hath given them a view of Eternity;
when Dangers hath presented Death to
the man, and Conscience hath cried,
Now thou art sinking, now there is
but a step betwixt thee and Eternity,
betwixt thee and another World? Oh
then what Convictions hath the Soul
lyen under? and yet it may be when
the Danger is over, the Conviction is
over too. Well, though we may forget
all, yet God remembers all. 3. God
hath a design upon us in our Dangers,
to prepare us for our latter end. The
danger thou art in, &amp; hath escaped, calls
for to prepare for thy Death, which
must certainly come to pass shortly. God
by Dangers would have you prepare for
Death: and oh! what a cutting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
will this be when thou com'st
to die? that thou who hast been in so
many dangers by Sea and Land, should
have no more learned to die, nor ready
to die. Alas, you escaped the last, that
you might prepare for the next. 4. God
hath a design upon our Graces by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us into danger; Danger is to exert
and draw forth Grace. Thus the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Dangers at Sea were to draw forth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49964:58"/>
their Faith. Faith and Patience comes
most visibly upon the stage in times of
most eminent danger. 5. God by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us into Dangers, hath a design upon
our Souls; he sometimes by danger of
drowning the Body, hath saved the
Soul, and hath caused it to say, <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issem
nisi periissem:</hi> I had perished, if I
had not perished. Some have escaped
shipwrack of Soul by shipwrack of
Body; and shall we forget such Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
when God hath such gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
in them upon us?</p>
            <p>2. He drives on gracious ends and
designs in our Deliverances, and shall
we then forget them? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. He spares
us, that we may account his long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Salvation; he gives, by sparing
of us, space to repent; and oh! what
a dreadful thing is it not to remember
wherefore we are spared and delivered?
<hi>He gave her space to Repent, but she repented
not.</hi> The Prisoner is Reprieved that he
might sue out his Pardon;<note place="margin">Psal. 56. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> and will he
forget the end for which he is Reprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
2. He delivers, that we may live
to him. Why was <hi>David's</hi> feet delivered
from falling? it was, that he might
walk before the Lord in the light of
the living. He gives us our lives, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49964:58"/>
we might give them back again to God.<note place="margin">Ier. 7. 10.</note>
Men are not delivered from dangers to
live to themselves, to live to their lusts,
to drink, and swear, and rant, and roar,
as a great many poor wretches do. That
say as they did, <hi>We are delivered to do all
these abominations.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 15.</note> 3. God hath another
end in Deliverance, that we might glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
him, in paying our Vows to him.
<hi>I will deliver thee;</hi> and what then? when
out of trouble never remember it
more, cast it behind thy back; O no;
<hi>And thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> He aims at a
revenue of glory out of your deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
4. God hath another end in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
of us; that we might enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
new Engagements, to be more the
Lords; as in times of great dangers,
there use to be great engagements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God and the Soul; so in times of
great deliverances, there are great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
pass betwixt God and the
Soul, new dedications to God; new
deliverances, call for new dedications of
the Soul to God; now the Soul should
be set apart for God more than ever.
5. God hath another end in delivering
of us, that we might break off our
league with sin; thus it was with them,
<hi>Shall we break his Commandments, after
such great deliverance as this?</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div type="application_of_sermon">
            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:49964:59"/>
            <head>APPLICATION.</head>
            <p>Is it so, that our Dangers and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances
should be remembred by us?
then it is a word of information:</p>
            <p>1. Learn we here how acceptable it
is to God, that we thankfully congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
our Mercies. No Musick like a
sound of Trumpets off the waters: so
O what sweet Musick, doth it make in
Gods ears, that you thankfully record
Sea-Mercies, and Sea-Deliverances;
this is Musick of the Waters; this
makes melody in Gods ears. Sea-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Sea-Praises<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come up acceptably
before the Lord; he is so pleased with
them, that he hath called them Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices:
O that men would offer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of Praise; this is the sound of
Trumpets you should carry to Sea with
you, outward bound, and homeward
bound.</p>
            <p>2. Learn we hence what a great evil
it is to lose the remembrance of our
Dangers and Deliverances. What do
many Families? what do many Persons
with the Sea-Dangers, with the Sea-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances?
do not they write them in
the dust? do not they bury them in the
Grave of Oblivion? do not they cast
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49964:59"/>
them behind their backs? do not they
trample them under foot? O poor
Souls! they little know what they do.
1. Such Deliverances will have a resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in their Consciences one day;
though they bury them now; O they
will rise again: and oh! how will they
then dread and terrifie a poor Soul?
2. Such Deliverances will another day
be witnesses and evidences against you.
Oh! what a cutting testimony will they
give in against the Soul? Hast not thou
been graciously and wonderfully deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in such a Voyage, in such a Storm
at Sea, in such a Sickness at Shore, and
yet walked unsuitably under all these?
To be cast out by Mercy, O what a
dreadful thing is this! 3. Such deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances
forgotten by us, harden us;
either they soften, or harden. These
Providences are like Gods Ordinances
in this respect, they either harden or
soften. Oh! what a dreadful thing it is
to be hardned by Deliverances and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
and yet many are. <hi>Sentence
not being speedily executed, the hearts of
men are fully set in them to do evil.</hi> 4. Such
Deliverances will be great aggravations
both of mans sin and misery, if forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by them. The goodness of God
<pb facs="tcp:49964:60"/>
was the aggravation of the sin of <hi>David,</hi>
says God,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>When I had done so and so for
thee, nay, and I would have done more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hast thou despised the Commandment of
the Lord, to do evil in his sight.</hi> What, for
you that had such deliverances as these,
to break his Commandments; as <hi>Ezra</hi>
says; O this is an high aggravation!
5. Deliverances and Dangers forgotten
will cause the Lord to pull in his hand
in a way of Mercy, will cause God to
give up Persons, and take his Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
presence from them, take them from
the shaddow of his Wings. Souls by
forgetting past dangers and deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
may put themselves from under
Gods Protection for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Is it so that we are to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
our Sea-Dangers and Deliverances?
then it is a word of Exhortation; be
exhorted then to call to mind, and keep
in mind, what God hath done for you;
and in this Exhortation I address my
self to Sea-faring men, whose lives are
a course and series of Wonders in their
frequent Salvations and Preservations,
(witness this Treatise) as you see the
wonders of God in the Deeps, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
The wonders of his Creation, so do
you see the wonders of his Salvation.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49964:60"/>
How often may <hi>Wonderful</hi> be Written
upon the Head of Salvations that you
are every Voyage receiving from God?
you never go out, and come home, but
God works <hi>Wonderfully,</hi> and appears
<hi>Wonderfully</hi> for you; Is not he a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-working-God
for you every Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age?</p>
            <p>The Exhortation is to call to mind,<note place="margin">Ps. 106 13.</note>
and keep in mind,<note place="margin">Ps 78. 11.</note> to Record and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister
your Dangers and Deliverances,
and not to do as <hi>Israel</hi> is said to do, who
soon forgot his works. How often
doth God bring in this sin of theirs in
one <hi>Psalm?</hi> They forgot his works,
and the wonders he had shewed them.</p>
            <p>1. Keep them in mind, for they are
wonderful Dangers and Deliverances;<note place="margin">Psal. 78. 12, 13.</note>
They are Wonders, these are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.
Marvelous things did he
for them, in the sight of their Fathers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> He devided the Sea, and caused
them to pass through, and he made the
waters to stand as an heap; and it is
brought in again in that Psalm.<note place="margin">Ps. 78 42.</note> They
remembred not his hand, nor the day
when God delivered them out of the
hand of the Enemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place,<note place="margin">Psal. 106. 21, 22.</note> They forgot God their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
which had done great things in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49964:61"/>
               <hi>Egypt.</hi> Wonderous works in the Land
of <hi>Ham.</hi> This heightens the sin exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
to forget such great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Dangers and Deliverances.</p>
            <p>1. Your Dangers are Wonderful in
this Respect, they are often such as
threaten a sentence of Death to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
upon you. May it not be said
of poor Sea-men, as was of them; <hi>For
we would not (Brethren) have you ignorant
of our trouble, which came to us in</hi> Asia, <hi>that
we were pressed out of measure, above strength,
insomuch that we despaired of life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor 1. 8, 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>but we
had the sentence of death in our selves, that
we should not trust in our selves, but in him
that raiseth the dead, who delivered us from
so great a Death, and doth Deliver.</hi> O how
many Sea-faring men may say thus!
Our dangers have been such, as we have
often despaired of life; there hath but
been a little betwixt us and Death; nay
betwixt us and Eternity; and shall we
forget such Dangers, when we have
been so near Death in them? As he
said to <hi>David, As the Lord lives, there is
but one step betwixt thee and death.</hi> O how
often have you been near sinking, near
drowning, and yet God hath then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
for you, with an outstretched
Arm, and in the Mount hath been seen,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49964:61"/>
and will not you Remember this?</p>
            <p>2. Your Dangers are Wonderful in
this Respect, they are sudden and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing,
they are wonderful sudden;
how are you often, all on a sudden,
threatned with nothing but present
Death and Destruction! It may be said
of Sea-men,<note place="margin">Iob 22. 10.</note> as of those in <hi>Iob, Snares
compasses them about, and sudden fear trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
them.</hi> It doth not only trouble
them, but all on a sudden trouble them,
before they know almost where they
are (as we say;) We read of some whose<note place="margin">Pro. 6. 15.</note>
Calamity shall come suddenly. <hi>Suddenly
shall he be broken without Remedy.</hi> O how
terrible is such a case, or such a danger!
and hath not God often threatned to
make this your case and condition? O
then do not forget such dangers that
have so suddenly lookt you in the Face!</p>
            <p>3. Your Dangers are Wonderful in
this Respect, they are not Dangers in
which your Bodies are concerned only,
but they are dangers in which your
Souls are concerned; It is not only the
danger of a Ship-wrack'd Vessel, and a
Shipwrack'd Estate, and a Shipwrack'd
Body, but a Shipwrack'd Soul. Here
is the great danger, lest thou make
a lost Voyage for thy Soul: If thou had
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49964:62"/>
died in such a Storm, or died in the
Terme of such a Voyage; Oh! what
would have become of thy Soul, Thy
precious, thy immortal Soul? Had not
thou died in a carnal, in a Christless
state and condition? Had not thy poor
Soul perished to all Eternity, if thou
then had miscarried? Was not thou
then a stranger altogether to Christ,
and a work of saving Grace upon thy
Heart? Had not thou then the guilt of
all thy sins upon the back of thy Soul
unpardoned? And ô what danger was
this! And wilt thou forget such
dangers?</p>
            <p>4. Your Dangers are such at Sea, as
none but a God can deliver from; all
your skill cannot; Oh, then is the
greatest Artist at his Wits end! The
Psalmist tells us,<note place="margin">Ps. 107. 27. The courage of such is set forth <hi>Olli Robur, &amp; aes triplex circa Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> Hor. Ver. 26.</note> the Marriners in their
Storms, are at their wits end; (or as
some read it) all their wisdom is swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up, they know not what course
to Steer, (the <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotators carry
it,) Now their very Pilots are at a loss;
Now all their courage cannot contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to their deliverance, though men
of the greatest natural courage and
magnanimity in the world: Yet now
their hearts melt because of troubles;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49964:62"/>
as it is said of the Marriners in <hi>Ionahs</hi>
Ship,<note place="margin">He that first ventred into his Ship at Sea, is said to have tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble brass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his breast, a Proverbial speech for a man of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> 
               <hi>The Marriners were afraid.</hi> O now,
when Death and Eternity, the Grave
and Judgment to come looks them in
the face! Then they are <hi>Magor-Miss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abibs,</hi>
terror to themselves, and to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them; O now, the danger is such,
it must be the only finger of God that
can help! I have heard of a Ship in
<hi>Yarmouth</hi> Road, that in a great Storm,
they feared the Anchor would come
home, and the Master discoursing with
a Youth in the Ship, that God had begun
lately to work some Convictions upon,
O says his Master, if God do but lay a
Finger upon one Strand of the Cable,
it will hold; and in the Morning many
Ships were lost near them, and there
was but one Strand in the Cable left.
O the finger of God only can some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
save in dangers. It was a good
saying of a godly Commander of a Ship
in eminent dangers, <hi>None now but that
God that saved the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>at
the Red Sea, can save us out of this distress;</hi>
and as soon as he had said it, the Wind
altered, and saved them; And will you
forget such dangers as none but a God
can save from?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:49964:63"/>
5. Your dangers at Sea are such as
many thousands have perished in; how
many have gone to Sea, that never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
more? that have been swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up in the belly of the great
Deeps? How many have perished by
the Sword at Sea? how many by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Storms? and that God should put
a difference betwixt you and others,
and you should forget it, this exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
heightens and aggravates the
guilt. How many have lost their lives?
how many have lost their limbs? and
yet in such dangers God hath brought
you off; this is never to be forgotten.</p>
            <p>2. Your dangers are not only won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
but your deliverances are so
too, and therefore should be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.
There is never a deliverance, but
you may read a wonder in it; so many
deliverances and salvations at Sea, so
many wonders. God saves you in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
way.</p>
            <p>1. Is not this a wonder, that persons
of such great sins and provocations,
should be persons of such great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and preservations? that such as
sin every Voyage, nay, it may be at an
high rate sin every Voyage, should be
saved and delivered at such an high
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49964:63"/>
rate every Voyage? is not this a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that men of such sins, should be
men of such salvations? that men that
sin against these salvations, should not
have these deliverances shorten upon
them. Oh what a wonder is this! We
should wonder if a person should be
continually disobliging any of us, and
yet we should be still heaping up kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
upon him: This made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ezra</hi> say, <hi>Shall we again break his
Commandments, after such deliverance as
this?</hi> O do not you provoke the Lord
every time that you go out, and still
he delivers you, still he returns you to
your Relations, to visit your habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in peace! and is not this a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</p>
            <p>2. Your deliverances are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
if you consider your deliverances
are great deliverances. We read of
such;<note place="margin">1 Chron. 11. 14.</note> 
               <hi>And the Lord saved them with a
great deliverance;</hi> or with a great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.<note place="margin">Iudg. 15. 18.</note>
Thus said <hi>Sampson, Thou hast
given this great deliverance into the hand
of thy servant.</hi> Now any great trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
are remembred and recorded.
Your deliverances are great, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
these things; 1. They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
deliverances by the great God;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49964:64"/>
his word of command brings all our
deliverances about, whether at Sea or
Land. Which made the Church in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
pray,<note place="margin">Psal. 44. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art my King, O God,
command deliverances for</hi> Jacob. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
every thing tending to deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
at Sea; in order to deliverance,
he commands the Winds;<note place="margin">Psal. 107. 29.</note> 
               <hi>He maketh the
storm a calm.</hi> He also commands the Seas;
he says to the proud Waves, <hi>So far, and
no further.</hi> You read of a decree set to
the Sea,<note place="margin">Ier. 5. 22.</note> that it cannot pass; <hi>Though
the Waves thereof toss themselves, yet can
they not prevail; though they roar, yet can
they not pass over it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 38. 8, 11.</note> It is the great God
only that rides Lord Admiral at Sea,
to command the Seas and the Waves
thereof. God is said to shut up the
Sea with doors, and set bars upon it.
<hi>Hithorto shalt thou come, and no further;
and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.
Xerxes</hi> presumed he could tame the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lespont,</hi>
for attempting his Bridge of
Boats; but all this was in vain, this is a
flower in Gods Crown alone, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Sea. Your deliverances are a
fruit and effect of Gods commanding
Power, therefore great. 2. They are
great deliverances, as they are the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
workmanship (as I may call them)
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49964:64"/>
of the Attributes of a great God. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
is said to be wrought for us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isai.</hi> 43. 13, 14.</note>
it is the handy work of God;<note place="margin">Gen. 11. 7.</note> 
               <hi>If God
will work,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Or as some take it of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are delivered in eminent dangers. We read of hands at work under the wings we see not, so the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous works of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances till they come forth O then how shall we admire them.</note> 
               <hi>who can let?</hi> (as the Prophet
saith.) And he seems to speak it upon
the account of the deliverance of his
People; <hi>For your sake I have sent down to</hi>
Babylon, <hi>and have brought down all their
Nobles, and the</hi> Caldeans, <hi>whose cry is in
their ships.</hi> In every deliverance there
is the excellent work of the Attributes
of God; we may in such a deliverance
say, Here is the Power of God, and here
is the Wisdom of God, and here is the
Love of God, and here is the Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For as God in the
confounding of the Languages at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
said, <hi>Go too, let us go down,</hi> (as if he
derected himself to his glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
compassing about his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Throne) <hi>Come, let us go down.</hi> So
when God sends us deliverances in our
distresses, he sets his Attributes at
work; Go Power, go Mercy, go Love,
go Faithfulness, go and act your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
parts in this deliverance; and
must not this be then an excellent and
curious Piece that Gods Attributes
bring forth? 3. They are great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances,<note place="margin">Ezek. 10. 21.</note>
if we consider the great sins
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49964:65"/>
and provocations they come over the
heads of, the great unworthiness of the
receiver, heightens much the mercy and
favour received; the reason why persons
do not greaten their deliverances, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do not greaten their sins, in
the deep sense and aggravations of them.
O sueh a Soul would say, as <hi>David, Is this
the manner of men?</hi> O God, is not this a
great deliverance, for such a great sinner
to receive? 4. They are great deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
if we consider the time and season of
their coming in; as this deliverance of
the Ships Company where <hi>Paul</hi> was, it
was when all hope of being saved was
taken away; and so were many of the
deliverances mentioned in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.
So <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sea-deliverance, when
he began to sink, Christ stretcheth forth
his hand immediately; he was now
sinking and going, but see how ready
Christ was to save;<note place="margin">Matth. 14. 28, 29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>He stretched forth his
hand and caught</hi> Peter. Our sinking time,
is Jesus Christs saving time. In the
Mount is the Lord seen; our extremity
is Gods opportunity; and are not then
these great deliverances never to be
forgotten? 5. They are great deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
if we consider they are not only
deliverances of Bodies, and Ships, and
Estates sometimes, but Souls; and where
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49964:65"/>
and where the Ship is lost, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
is lost, yet for the life to be saved,
and the Soul delivered, is a very great
Deliverance; a Reprieve when a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
is under the sentence of Death, is
a great Mercy: O when God Reprieves
a poor Prisoner, this is some Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
we read of some Deliverance
God gave to <hi>Israel</hi> in the days of <hi>Shishak;</hi>
a Reprieve is some Deliverance, but if
it end in suing out the Prisoners Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
then it is a great Deliverance. If it
be such a Deliverance in a Storm at Sea,
as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had from a Sickness at
Shoar,<note place="margin">Is. 38.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast delivered me in love to my
Soul, and cast all my sins behind thy back;</hi>
This is a double Deliverance, and sure
such Deliverances as these are worth
Recording; These are to be written in
Marble and not in Dust, with the Pen
of Iron, (as the Prophet says) and not
with the point of a Diamond.</p>
            <p>3. Your Deliverances are wonderful,
if you consider the many thousands
that have perished in less Dangers to an
eye of Reason; they are distinguishing
Deliverances, and therefore wonderful
hath God dealt with all men that go to
Sea as with you. Hath not thousands
perished by the Sword at Sea in bloody
Engagements? Miscarried at Sea in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49964:66"/>
dreadful and terrible Storms; Hath
not the Sea been a Sepulcher for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands?
Are not there Millions of the
Dead that the Sea must one day give
up, and yet you Delivered, and yet you
spared? O what distinguishing Mercy
is this! And shall this be forgotten by
you? Should not you keep Records of
distinguishing Mercy? How many sunk
sometimes, and perished by your sides?
How many that went out with you that
never Returned? One taken, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
left; one sunk, and another saved.</p>
            <p>4. Your Deliverances are Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
if you consider the way that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
God takes to bring them about;
O what strange ways doth God take to
deliver, when he hath a mind to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
sometimes he brings down to the
very Gate of the Grave, he brings to
the Doors and Bars of the Sea, and then
shuts these doors; as <hi>Iob</hi> speaks, He
brings to the next door to perishing,
and then he delivers; <hi>Master save me, or
I perish;</hi> and then he lends an Arm,
witness many of these deliverances here
mentioned. Sometimes he doth it by
strange means, low and contemptible,
as the poor man that we Read of,<note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 15.</note> that
delivered the City, sometimes by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
of and unexpected means, as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49964:66"/>
he that Relieved Major <hi>Gibbons,</hi> as this
Story mentions, he was a <hi>French</hi> Pyrate.
As that Ship I have heard off, that when
she sprang a Leak, and they all had like
to have perished, all on a sudden the
Leak stopt, and they knew no Reason,
but when they came into the next Port
to search her, there was a great Fish had
wrought himself into the Leak, that
they were glad to cut him out; was
not here a miraculous deliverance?
That <hi>Ionah</hi> should be swallowed up by
the Whale, ô what a miracle was this!
and so he was preserved! and how have
some been saved by sudden shifts of
Winds when neer sinking and perishing?
these are to be remembred to the Lord
while you live: Oh! methinks this one
Motive should set on the Exhortation,
if I should use no more, to Remember
your Dangers and your Deliverances.</p>
            <p>But secondly, another Motive is
this, to Remember your Dangers with
your Deliverances; this will in your
great distresses and extremities, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
some hope to you; to read over
your Register, your ancient Records,
how good God hath been at such a
time, and such a time; how seasonably
he stept in and delivered in such a strait
and such a strait; Oh then says the Soul,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49964:67"/>
why should I despair, and cast off all
hope now?<note place="margin">Past Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are good food for faith. We read God gave the Leviathan to be meat for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the wilderness, Psal. 74. 14 which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors take to be meat for their Faith.</note> hath not he appeared and
saved in Deaths often before now? for
past experiences are good supports for
Hope in present exigencies and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
thus <hi>David</hi> argues, when at a
great strait, <hi>Thou hast delivered me, and
wilt deliver me;</hi> and thus <hi>Paul, Thou hast
delivered me, and wilt deliver me.</hi> Haman
found this a good way to Remember
the years of the Lords right hand.</p>
            <p>3. Remember your Dangers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances,
for God Records them;
they are filled up by God, and he will
mind you of them another day if you
forget them now; he keeps his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
and Records, he hath his Book of
Remembrance of your forgotten Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
as well as your forgotten sins; God
will one day read over all those Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances
you have forgotten; Oh poor
Soul! did not I deliver thee in such a
Danger, in such a Distress, in such a
Death, when there was no Hope, when
there was no Help, yet all this hast thou
forgotten; forgotten thy Mercy, and
forgotten the God of thy Mercy; Oh!
will not this sting you to the Heart,
when God shall cause your strangled
and murdered Mercies to walk in your
Consciences? when he shall give them
a Resurrection there?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:49964:67"/>
4. Motive to Remember your Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Deliverances; the Vows of
God are upon you; Oh! what did you
say to God in the day of your distress
and calamity? Lord, if thou wilt now
appear, and be a present help in time of
trouble, it shall never be forgotten, it
shall be remembred to the Lord as long
as we have a day to live; but when God
brings poor Souls off, many do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forget their Vows, but deny them;<note place="margin">Ionah 1. 16.</note>
In Ancient times it was usual in eminent
dangers, whether at Sea or Land, to
make Vows; We read that <hi>Ionahs</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
they Vowed Vows; <hi>David</hi> did
thus,<note place="margin">Psal. 56. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Thy Vows are upon me, O God! I will
render praises unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. (and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place) <hi>I will pay thee my Vows,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 66. 25. 15.</note> 
               <hi>which
my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
when I was in trouble;</hi> But because
this is so ordinary to make Vows at
Sea, and brake them a Shoar, let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
a little upon it. 1. Why should
you forget your Vows after your Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances?
They were not rash Vows,
there might have been some excuse, if
you had made them rashly, you might
then have had a Plea, for saying it was
an Error; but in times of distress, men
are serious, when Death and Eternity
is set before them, and they upon the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49964:68"/>
brink of another world;<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 4, 5.</note> dare you sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
rashly Vow, in this day of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress;
O no, your Consciences will
bear witness against you, that you were
in sober-sadness at that day. 2. Why
should you forget your Vows after your
Deliverances, for God will require pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Nay, this is not only the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why we should not forget to pay,
but why we should not delay to pay;
<hi>When thou vowest a vow to the Lord thy God,
thou shouldst not slack to pay it, for the Lord
thy God will require it, yea, will surely require
it of thee, and it would be sin in thee.</hi> Take
it for granted he will do it, yea,<note place="margin">Deut. 23. 21.</note> he will
surely do it. 1. He will require it, so as
to call to a payment day, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it, he will send unto you a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to pay the Vows you made to him
in the day of your Distress. Oh! how
often is Conscience Gods Officer, that
he sends to you to demand Payment?
O says Conscience, Sinner, pay what
thou owest to the God of thy deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances;
is not he a God to whom the
Vows must be performed? 2. He will
require it, so as to punish the non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and so requiring is here taken,
and in many other places, the Lord
doth very often severely punish Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking;
breaking of Vows doth cause
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49964:68"/>
God often to destroy the works of your
hands. Say not before the Angel,<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>It was
an error, wherefore should God be angry at
thy Vows, and destroy the works of thy hands?</hi>
Some Expositors refer this to the Priest,
before whom the sin of rash vows was
to be contest; others carry it to Christ,
the Angel of the Covenant, who sees
through all our subtil excuses and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocations,
and punishes them. O,
God is angry when men go so flatly
against their Vows; O then God is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and destroys the work of their
hands, <hi>viz.</hi> disappoints their endeavors,
and denies them success.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to forget your deliverances
and dangers, is the greatest ingratitude
and unthankfulness in the world; hath
God given you so many wonderful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances,
so many miraculous preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
to be buried in the grave of
oblivion? will you murder your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and then bury them? It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conly
said, Murder will out. Murdered
Mercies will one day make terrible
work, in walking in your Consciences.</p>
            <p>The next Observation is this, That
Salvations and Deliverances many times
are not sent until persons be left help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and hopeless. I shall give you a
touch of this. Now all hope of being
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49964:69"/>
saved was taken away, no small tempest
lay upon them; now they were gulft
in despair of ever coming off with their
lives: Yet this often is the condition of
Nations, Ship-Companies, and Persons,
where God intends to save and deliver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The proofs of the last Observation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Dangers and Deliverances being
recorded and remembred, proves this
also. Thus was <hi>Peter</hi> saved, the Disciple;
saved, when just at sinking.</p>
            <p>But why doth God stay so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he sends deliverances and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
1. Because he delights to draw
forth a spirit of prayer; if men will not
pray, when sinking, when drowning,
when dying, they will never pray. O
see how <hi>Ionah</hi> prays in his distress:<note place="margin">Ionah 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>And</hi>
Jonah <hi>prayed to the Lord out of the Fishes
belly, and said, I cried by reason of mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
unto the Lord, and he heard me;
out of the belly of Hell cried I, and thou
heardst my voice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">vers. 7.</note> &amp;c. <hi>When my Soul fainted
within me, I remembred the Lord; and my
Prayer came in unto thy holy Temple.</hi> O
Sirs, God loves prayer so well, that he
stayes with his deliverances, that we
might sue them out by prayer.<note place="margin">Psal. 130. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Out of
the Depths have I cried unto thee,</hi> saith
<hi>David:</hi> Driven to it by deep and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless
straits, into which I am plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49964:69"/>
And it seems to be an allusion to
Mariners, in their distresses and dangers
of being shipwrackt, crying unto the
Lord. What, will any man perish, and
never pray for it! die, and never cry
for it! what, and not say as <hi>Peter</hi> did,
<hi>Master, save me, or I perish?</hi> What was it
that did draw forth prayer in many of
these distressed Ship-Companies (in this
Treatise mentioned) but their dangers
and distresses?</p>
            <p>2. God doth not bring our deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
and salvations until we be hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
because he will exercise his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
graces: Therefore the Disciples
were not saved until the ship was full,
that their graces might be exercised. O
now is a time for faith and patience to
be exerted; there is nothing more
pleasing unto God, then to see how
poor Souls exercise their graces, when
they are reduced into extremities; God
hath a great revenue of glory arising to
himself, out of the exercise of his own
grace in the Souls of Believers. O how
doth Faith act its part when mercy and
deliverance is delayed! It was one of
<hi>Luther</hi>'s wonders, to believe for mercy
that was long delayed. It is an high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Faith, to look up to God long
together, and nothing to come. To say
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49964:70"/>
with the Prophet <hi>Ionah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ionah 2. 4, 8.</note> 
               <hi>I will look again
towards thy holy Temple.</hi> And with the
Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isaiah 17.</note> 
               <hi>Though he hide his face
from the house of</hi> Jacob, <hi>I will wait upon
him, and look for him.</hi> What though thou
be as the Prophets Servant, who went
down to the Sea to look, and he said,
<hi>Master;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 18. latter end.</note> 
               <hi>there is nothing.</hi> But what then?
doth he give over? O no, looks again;
and the seventh look he saw the Cloud.
So Faith in its exercise, will look again
and again, and never give over, until
it espy the mercy coming upon the
wings of prayer. So might I add of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
O how doth it act its part while
the deliverance tarries; it quietly waits
for the salvation of God; saying, as
<hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 130. vers. 6.</note> 
               <hi>My Soul waits for the Lord, more
than they that watch for the morning.</hi> The
Soul of the Believer possesses it self in
patience until the mercy come.</p>
            <p>3. God doth not bring our salvations
and deliverances, until we be brought
to an extremity; because they are most
prized and welcomed until then. O
now deliverance will be prized: The
longer that a mercy tarries, the more
welcome it is when it comes; God loves
to make all his mercies welcome to us.
O how welcome is life, to a person un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a sentence of death! O how wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49964:70"/>
is a discovery of the love of Christ
to a poor Soul, that hath long groaned
under the burthen of unpardoned guilt.
O how welcome was the Prodigals Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
House, when he had so long been
starving in the Fields, with his Husks,
amongst the Swine!</p>
            <p>4. Because God will have all his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and deliverances look like his own
hand and arm, his own arm brings sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
with him; he will have the print
of his own hand upon it, that poor
sinners may say, <hi>This is the finger of God,</hi>
the doings of God, <hi>and it is marvellous in
our eyes.</hi> Alas, men would attribute it
to themselves, if salvation did not come
in such a way, when all hope of being
saved is taken away. Oh! everything
is beautiful in its season; Is not salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and deliverance now in season?
now they begin to despair, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
or visible hopes. O now God
works like himself, now he appears in a
deliverance to be God; which set the
Disciples a wondring,<note place="margin">Mark 4. 41.</note> 
               <hi>What manner of
Man is this, that the Winds and Sea obey
him?</hi> And at another time, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
his Disciples at Sea, and calmed
the Winds, then they that were in the
Ship worshipped him, saying,<note place="margin">Matth. 14. 32, 33.</note> 
               <hi>Of a truth
thou art the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:49964:71"/>
5. Because he will by such salvations
set off his love to poor Souls: Was not
the love of Christ set off highly, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that season to save the ship when
it was full; to save them when they
were sinking; Is not that great Love,
that steps forth to save in an Extremity?
O what Love was this, to save this Ships
Company, when all hope of being saved
was taken away? Love always chuses the
fittest times to appear &amp; evidence it self.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Because he will have his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances,
endearing deliverances to
Souls. O how doth such an appearance
of God, at such a time, endear the Soul
of the receiver. Therefore saith <hi>David,
I will love the Lord,</hi> (or love the Lord
dearly) <hi>my Rock and my Deliverer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I will proceed to give you also a
taste of the Application, and not be
large, because I have been large upon
the former, which was mainly intended.</p>
            <p>1. Then learn we hence, that God
may for gracious ends, known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
delay a mercy or a deliverance, and
yet fully intends to give in that mercy.
<hi>Iacob</hi> may wrestle all night, and yet be
put off; but in the break of day the
mercy comes. The Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi>
may cry to Christ for her Daughter, and
at present be put off, yet at last she shall
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49964:71"/>
carry it. The believing Soul may not
have the Dove come with an Olive-branch
in her mouth until evening.
Christs manifesting of his love to poor
Souls, is called his supping with them;
<hi>And I will sup with you:</hi> Now supper
comes not up till evening.</p>
            <p>2. Learn we hence, that Gods timing
our deliverances and salvations, is best
for us; his time is the best time. Our
time is always ready, (but saith Christ)
<hi>My time is not yet.</hi> If we had our mercies
in our time, we should not see that
beauty in them; for every thing is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
in its season: and God chuses the
fittest seasons to send them, because he
will put a beauty upon them.</p>
            <p>3. Learn we hence, that no case is
desperate to God, though it be so to
man: One would have thought this a
desperate case, in such a storm, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Ship, the casting out of the
Tackling of the Ship, neither Sun nor
Stars appeared, and all hope of being
saved taken away; yet all this was but
desperate to them, it was not so to
God: now their extremity becomes
Gods opportunity, and he takes this
juncture of time to appear in. Thus
<hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 42, 7, 8.</note> all Gods waves and Gods billows
had gone over him; a desperate case!
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49964:72"/>
yet God (then he believes) would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his loving kindness in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
and his song should be with him
in the night. Faith is an excellent grace
at a desperate stand.</p>
            <p>4. Learn we hence, that Gods thoughts
are not as our thoughts; when we think
of nothing but sinking and perishing,
then doth God think of saving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering.
They thought all hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
saved was taken away, but God looks
through the storm and Cloud, and
comforts them. As the Disciples, when
they thought it had been a Spirit in
their Storm that appeared to them;
<hi>No,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 6. 50, 51, 52.</note> saith Christ, <hi>be not afraid; be of good
chear, it is I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Is it so, that the salvations and
deliverances that many of us have, are
not until we be brought to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
then it is a word of exhortation;
1. Then look up to God in the most
desperate case, when you know not what
to do in your storms at Sea, in your
straits at Land. O then let your eyes be
up unto the Lord; you see how many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
have come down in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as answers to pray. O pray hard; let
going to Sea, being in storms at Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought to extremities at Sea, learn
you then to pray.</p>
