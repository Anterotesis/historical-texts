            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <p>AS God obſerves a time for every Gift, ſo he obſerves a fulneſs of time for a full Gift: To endue our ſouls with a fulneſs of Patience and with a fulneſs of Thankfulneſs; with a fulneſs of Patience whiles the full gift is yet coming; and with a fulneſs of thankfulneſs when it is at laſt come: This twofold fulneſs muſt be in every Chriſtian ſoul to entertain our Saviour Chriſt, or it will have an emptineſs of Chriſtianity: They are both together in the Prophets Hymn of Thankſgiving, <hi>Iſa. 25. 9. Lo this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us; This is the Lord, we have waited for him; we will be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his ſalvation: We have waited for him,</hi> there's the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Patience; <hi>we will be glad and rejoyce in his ſalvation,</hi> there's the fulneſs of Thankfulneſs.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, God requires in all Chriſtian ſouls a fulneſs of Patience; Hence it was that though he promiſed Chriſt in the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.) yet he did not ſend him till towards the latter end of it; ſurely to make us the more ſenſible of our own miſery, and by it, the more capable of his mercy; And to endear his everlaſting love unto our ſouls, whiles we profeſs by our waiting his leiſure, That we cannot pretend De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, where we are bound to Patience; and conſequently what we cannot expect with too much Patience, we may not receive with too little thankfulneſs: But there is alſo another reaſon of our Patience, that as Chriſt was long expected in his firſt, ſo he may alſo be long expected in his ſecond coming: For as we waited for the Saviour, ſo alſo muſt we wait for the ſalvation: God waits to give it; much more muſt man wait to receive it; ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa, 30. 18. And therefore will the Lord wait that he maybe gracious unto you;</hi> there's the firſt, God wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give grace; <hi>Bleſſed are all they that wait for him,</hi> there's the ſecond, man waiting to receive Grace: And he waits not in vain; for he is bleſſed <hi>in</hi> and <hi>for</hi> his waiting, and much more

of Scripture, the word of Chriſt: But where the Apoſtle doth indeed follow Chriſt, there to run away from the Apoſtle, is in effect to run away from Chriſt; even as to follow him, is indeed to follow Chriſt: The like muſt be ſaid of the Authority of the Church, which ſucceeds the Authority of the Apoſtles, unleſs we will ſuppoſe all the promiſes of Chriſt to his Apoſtles, and all the Precepts of the Apoſtles to the People, to have been meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly momentary and temporal, and not to have been written for our <hi>admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 11. A ſuppoſition ſo far from true godlineſs, that you ſee it is directly againſt the expreſs Word of God: Wherefore we may not doubt to follow the Church in thoſe things wherein the Church follows Chriſt; And the Church follows Chriſt in all thoſe things, for which ſhe can alledge either Precept or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent from the Word of Chriſt, or can give a reaſon agreeable with his Word; And we cannot deny but that in this caſe the Church hath both <hi>Precedent,</hi> and <hi>Precept,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> drawn from the Word of Chriſt; The <hi>Precedent</hi> is in general from the Jews appointing the Feaſt of Dedication without any peculiar command of the Old, yet not without the approbation of the New Teſtament, <hi>John</hi> 10. 22. In ſpecial from the Angels of God, who moſt zealouſly kept this Feſtival: The <hi>Precept</hi> is from the general equity of the Levitical Law, which ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth Chriſtians, as it is ſubſervient to Moral and Religious, though not to Typical and Ceremonious worſhip, and that plainly calls for Annual Feſtivals in honour of Chriſt, unleſs we will ſay that leſs honour is due to him ſince he is come in the fleſh, then was due to him before his coming: The <hi>Reaſon</hi> is clearly from the very inſtitution of the Church; for God gave <hi>Paſtors and Teachers for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12. but the right way of edifying, is to lay the foundation upon the chief corner-ſtone: And doubtleſs this was the reaſon why the Church firſt appointed an Advent Sunday (which muſt needs be very antient, or elſe all the Order of the ſervice could not depend upon it) becauſe ſhe obſerved that all the Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Old Teſtament, did aim only at this, To fit and prepare men for the coming of Chriſt, and therefore was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous That we might ſo prepare our ſelves to receive Chriſt at his firſt coming to ſave us, that we might not tremble at his ſecond

                           <p>GOD obſerved not time for it ſelf, but for his Son; ſo muſt we obſerve no Feſtival for it ſelf, but only for our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; no day for it ſelf, but for the Lord.</p>
                           <p>Were Chriſtmas-Day (for that word is no more Popiſhly ſuperſtitious to me, then the ſpirit of <hi>Python, Acts</hi> 16. 16. or the ſigns of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux, Acts</hi> 28. 11. were Paganly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious to Saint <hi>Luke</hi>) I ſay, were Chriſtmas-Day to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for it ſelf, as the 25. Day of <hi>December,</hi> we had need to go not only to the Roman Archives for a moral aſſurance, but alſo to the Chriſtian Archives, (the word of God) for a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical aſſurance, That Chriſt was born on that very Day, or we could not Religiouſly obſerve it in the aſſurance of Faith;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114933:23"/>
But ſince Chriſtmas-Day is to be obſerved for its Duty, which is to give God thanks for the bleſſed Nativity of his eternal Son, who took our nature upon him and was born of a pure Virgin to Redeem us from Sin, Death and the Devil, a moral aſſurance is more then enough for the Day, (which indeed is the beſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance we can have of any day) ſince we have a full Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aſſurance for the Duty. And here I cannot but ſay in zeal to my Saviour, and to the ſalvation of their ſouls, of whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> propheſied when he ſaid, <hi>That there ſhall come in the laſt daies ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 3. what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> once ſaid to the Iews at <hi>Antioch, Acts 13. 40, 41. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware therefore leaſt that come upon you which is ſpoken of in the Prophets, Behold ye Deſpiſers and wonder and periſh:</hi> yea behold that ye may wonder, and wonder that ye may not periſh in your deſpiſings of God and of his Church; For whoſoever ſhall ſcoff and mock at the keeping of Chriſtmas-day, in relation to the 25. Day of <hi>December,</hi> is guilty of Ignorance, Immodeſty, and Indiſcretion, becauſe he mocks at the Practice of millions of men much wiſer then himſelf; But he that ſhall mock at keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in relation to the Duty, muſt alſo be guilty of Impiety, Infidelity and Irreligion, becauſe he mocks at the profeſſion of an Article of the Chriſtian Faith, and of that Article which is indeed the Ground and Foundation of all the Reſt; For if Chriſt had not been born, he could not have ſuffered, nor have riſen again; So that upon this one Article of Chriſts Nativity, are indeed grounded all the other Articles of our Chriſtian Faith; So nearly doth it concern us to maintain our publick profeſſion of this Article, leaſt we ſhould be thought to have forgotten or to have forſaken all the reſt.</p>
                           <p>And this is reaſon enough why amongſt other daies we ſhould ſtill obſerve this day of Chriſts Nativity, not for it ſelf (for ſo happily it may not be ſafe to obſerve any day) but for the Lord; ſo ſhall we not impeach our Chriſtian liberty, and we ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our Chriſtian Piety,</p>

O God work in us this great miracle of thy Grace to raiſe our ſouls, that we may all rejoyce in that great miracle of thy power which thou wilt at the laſt day work on us, in the raiſing of our bodies.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly and laſtly, we need imploy our time readily and carefully in thoſe Chriſtian Duties which immediately concern the honour of Chriſt, that we be not defective in our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs after our Devotions, after we have had the honour and the happineſs to converſe with our bleſſed Saviour.

                           <p>And God the Father did the like. <hi>Heb. 1. 6.

God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt did look and point very punctually at Chriſts

                           <p>THE Pſalmiſt teacheth us a Leſſon of everlaſting Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for this everlaſting Mercy, as appears <hi>Pſalm</hi> 72. The chief argument of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> is Chriſt, as is proved in the 8. and 9. <hi>verſes,</hi> from the extent of his Dominion, far beyond <hi>Solomons,</hi> even to the worlds end; and much more in the 10. and 11. <hi>verſes</hi> from the excellency of his Perſon, That <hi>All Kings ſhould fall down before him,</hi> And particularly, That <hi>the Kings of Arabia and Saba ſhould bring him gifts</hi> (which was literally fulfilled in the Preſents of the wiſe men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. who by the Antients were both called and reputed Kings;) And the Concluſion that is inferred from theſe Premiſes, is Thankſgiving. The argument of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> is everlaſting mercy, even the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God to man in Chriſt; and the Concluſion of it is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Thankfulneſs; for ſo it follows, <hi>ver. 18. &amp; 19.

                           <p>Thus, in Gods account, That is only the Perfection of Time wherein he gives Chriſt: and why not alſo in ours, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we receive him? For in truth all the Time of our life is but an imperfect Time, till we have gained Chriſt; There may be the Perfection of the natural man before, but not of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man, till he come to <hi>the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 4. 13. All the Time of our life, though we live to <hi>Methuſelah's</hi> Age, is but imperfection of Time, till with good old <hi>Simeon,</hi> we come by the Spirit into the Temple, and there ſee and embrace the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 27, 28.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114933:31"/>
Reaſon of our joyfully receiving this gift, muſt be this, That it proceeded from Gods infinite and undeſerved love towards us: For Gods firſt gift to man was his love in his Son; His ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond gift, was his Son in our nature; So ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, 2 Tim. 1. 9. According to his own purpoſe and grace which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began.</hi> Gods firſt gift was grace given us in Chriſt; his ſecond gift, was Chriſt given us in our fleſh: And the Maſter of Scholaſtical ſubtilties makes this a rule of ſound Reaſon, as well as of ſound Religion, <hi>Inter omnia do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na dantis, primum donum quod dat, &amp; quiſquis dare poteſt, eſt Amor ejus quem primo dat amato, quia eſt ratio cujuſcunque alteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us doni; nihil enim habet rationem doni, niſi in quantum cadit ſub actu Amoris.

The firſt gift which every one gives to him whom he loves, is his love; which is indeed the only reaſon of all his other gifts; for nothing can have the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a gift, but as it proceeds from love.</hi> And therefore God firſt gives us his love, before he gives us any thing elſe: and he gives nothing as a bleſſing, but what he gives in love; as for example, Government is the beſt temporal gift to any Nation, yet given in anger, is no bleſsing, and conſequently no gift: ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Dedi Regem iratus eis, Hoſ. 13. 11.

                           <p>Again, the Goſpel of Chriſt is the beſt ſpiritual gift that can be given to any People, yet given not in love, oft-times proves no Bleſſing, and conſequently no gift. Like Manna to the <hi>Iſraeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. Manna was a type of Chriſt, ſo owned by Chriſt himſelf. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 32. That was the Typical, this is the real Bread from Heaven which nouriſheth our ſouls to eternal Life: And it, is with this as it was with that bread; with the Goſpel of Chriſt as it was with the Manna; If given not in love but in anger, it will ſcarce turn to our ſpiritual nouriſhment: And we may juſtly fear it is now with the Goſpel as it was then with that Manna. God gives it without his love, to thoſe that either tempt him in their hearts, as the Jews did, ver. 18. <hi>asking meat for their luſts,</hi> looking after the Word more for curioſity then for conſcience: or that tempt him with their mouths, as the Jews did, ver. 19, 20. <hi>They ſpake againſt God, and ſaid, Can God furniſh a Table in the wilderneſs? can he give bread alſo? can he provide fleſh for his people?</hi> A ſin that contentious men are too much guilty of, who in the midſt of <hi>Eden</hi> cry out as if they were in in a wilderdeſs: in the midſt of plenty repine as if they were in want: they do in effect ſay, that God cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them a table good enough, unleſs their own hands help to make it; or will not prepare them a table ſoon enough, unleſs they overhaſten his preparation. To complain againſt God inſtead of rendring humble &amp; hearty thanks unto him to complain againſt him out of meer wantonneſs, not out of any want, ſave only of a thankful heart within our ſelves, is to do as the Jews did in this place, and then we muſt look to fare as they did; for <hi>a fire was kindled amongſt them, and anger came up againſt them,</hi> ver. 21. And if we make God angry as they did, we cannot but expect to feel the ſame ſad effects of his Anger, as it is ſaid ver. 30, 31. <hi>But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the wrath of God came upon them, and ſlew the faſteſt of them, and ſmote down the choſen men of</hi> Iſrael. Juſt ſo is it with thoſe that are of a quarrelſom reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that will not receive Chriſt in the way that God offers him; they commonly have Chriſt not in love, but in anger: not to make them the more happy, but the more inexcuſable: not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114933:32"/>
to make them the better Chriſtians, but to bring them under a ſtricter account for their defiance of Chriſt, and their abuſe of Chriſtianity: they know more of their Maſters will, but it is to do the leſs of it, that ſo they may be beaten with many ſtripes: <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 47. Nay indeed they know leſs of their Maſters will, though they would be thought to know more of it. For thoſe know leaſt of Chriſt, who ſeek to know moſt of him by conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and by faction: ſince he that ſaid, <hi>learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, Mat.</hi> 11. 29. will never take contention for meekneſs, nor faction for lowlineſs (and therefore will not teach ſuch as love to be contentious and factions.)

And truly Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes eternal life to ſpring from no other root, but only from this root of <hi>Jeſſe;</hi> when he ſaith in his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus, cap. 1. v.</hi> 2. That <hi>God promiſed eternal life before the world began;</hi> I ask to whom did he promiſe it? Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> thinks to the Angels; but they not having been before the world, it was impoſſible a promiſe made before the world began, ſhould be made to them; It is much ſafer to ſay, That this promiſe of eternal life was made to our bleſſed Saviour in our ſtead, and that God the Father promiſed to God the Son before the world began, That as many as ſhould live <hi>according to the Faith of Gods Elect, and the acknowledgment of the Truth which is after Godlineſs,</hi> ſhould in him have eternal life: For thus the ſame Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes a dialogue betwixt God the Father and God the Son, in the Love and Communion of God the Holy Ghoſt, to which the Angels were not admitted, <hi>Heb. 1. 13.

Their office was to wait for the ſervice of the houſe of the Lord, and to ſtand every morning to thank and praiſe the Lord, and likewiſe at even:</hi> It was their office every morning and evening to ſing Gods praiſes publickly in Gods houſe, and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves only with, and much leſs to confine themſelves
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114933:34"/>
only to their Sabbath, as if God by claiming or challenging that day, had thereby denyed and rejected all the reſt: Had this practice of praiſing God daily in the Temple been ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or will-worſhip in the Jewiſh Church, we ſhould have found it not commanded and commended, but reproved and reformed by their Pious Kings and Prophets, (for their Kings did not reform without the advice of their Prophets) but not finding this Practiſe Reproved or Reformed by them, how comes it among ſome Chriſtians to be accounted as a main Piece of their Reformation, to ſhut up the doors of Gods houſe all the week daies, and to open them only upon Sundaies? and then in truth to open them for ſuch a worſhip of God as is publick rather for its accidents then for its ſubſtance; rather for its time and place, then for its matter and form, rather for its notice and for its noiſe, then for its Communion? For though a man may go to Church as a Judge, (wherein he chiefly ſerves himſelf, and pleaſes his curioſity) upon unknown and uncertain terms; yet he can ſcarce go to Church as a Communicant, (wherein alone he ſerves his God, and ſatisfies his conſcience) unleſs he be ſure and certain of the terms of his Communion; for the conſcience cannot be ſatisfied, and much leſs can God be ſerved upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties: And ſince the Apoſtle hath expreſly ſaid, That <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſin, Rom.</hi> 13. 23. Thoſe men do very indiſcreetly, who in their publick worſhip do rather exerciſe their Phanſies then their Faith; and thoſe do very irreligiouſly who labour all they can to ſpread and to promote that exerciſe; For in the work of ſerving God, above all other works, it is evident, That the diminution of Faith is the addition of ſin; wherefore men have little reaſon to bring themſelves, and leſs Religion to ſeek to bring others to any the leaſt diminution of their Faith in Gods ſervice; for that is to come under the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of <hi>Judas</hi> his curſe, <hi>Let his prayer be turned into ſin, Pſalm 109. v.</hi> 6. We muſt then take it for an argument of true love, even the love of our ſouls and of our ſalvation, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church did in imitation of the Church of the Jews, offer up daily Prayers and Praiſes unto Almighty God for us, and alſo teach us to offer up daily Prayers and Praiſes for our ſelves; And it is to be feared That men have rewarded the Church of Chriſt <hi>evil for good, hatred for her good will,</hi> in that the diſmal
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114933:35"/>
curſe which follows in the next verſes, hath fallen upon ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations of the Chriſtian world: For it is evident that this curſe, <hi>ſet thou an ungodly man to rule over him, and let Satan ſtand at his right hand, let his days be few, and his children be vagabonds,</hi> &amp;c. is uſhered in with this ſin, <hi>For the love that I had unto them, loe they take now my contrary part,</hi> ver. 3. and is continued and confirmed; for it is <hi>becauſe his mind was not to do good, but perſecuted the poor helpleſs man, that he might ſlay him that was vexed at the heart:</hi> and ver. 16. <hi>His delight was in curſing, and it ſhall happen unto him: he loved not bleſſing, therefore ſhall it be far from him.</hi> For nothing is more offenſive to God, then that men will not return love for love: And yet this hath been always the portion of his Church: ſhe hath ſtill found returns of hatred for love; For there is no true Chriſtian Church, but may truely ſay with Saint <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 12. 15. I will very gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you,</hi> (it is in the Original Greek, for your ſouls) <hi>though the more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I love you, the leſs I be loved.</hi> No love affectionate like this, which loves the ſoul: no love abundant like this, which makes the lover ſpend and be ſpent for his affection; and ſuch is the love of every true Chriſtian Church, (which is the grand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of its nation,) it loves affectionately, it loves abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, (for what it wants of this charity, it wants of true Chriſtianity) but doth ſeldome receive back again love for love: It was <hi>Luthers</hi> complaint, that whilſt he Preached and practiſed mans Inventions, he found too much love; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he preached Gods truth, (the Goſpel in its own ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,) he found too little: ſo hath it been ever ſince his time with Proteſtant Churches: for thoſe which have moſt deſerved the peoples thanks, (for teaching them the true and the right way to heaven,) have leaſt found their love.</p>
                           <p>Thus we ſee to our grief, no leſs then to our miſchief, that the beſt of men may love in vain: but God never loves in vain. For he never loves, but he is beloved again: ſo ſaith the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Diſciple, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 19. We love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> As he loves us, ſo we love him again; though he love firſt, we afterwards: and therefore if we love not him, the reaſon is, becauſe he hath not loved us, in the Son of his love.

God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hated by any man as he is in himſelf, no more then good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can be hated; but he is hated only for ſome effects of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: therefore I ſay not, if we love not God in himſelf, but if we love not God in his Vice-gerency or Authority, (whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical,) by our dutifulneſs and fidelity; If we love not God in his Commands and Ordinances, by our Obedience and Piety: Laſtly, If we love not God in his image and likeneſs by our brotherly and Chriſtian Charity, we do indeed not love God: (for himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>I ye love me, keep my commandments, Joh.</hi> 14, 15.) And if we do not love God, the reaſon can be no other but this, becauſe he hath not loved us. And it were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſome men, who moſt think themſelves the darlings of heaven, would try their ſpiritual eſtate by this touchſtone; for if we are indeed in the love of God, and in the Son of his love, it will appear by our returning love back again to him; And the Apoſtles conſequence being as good for the Negative, as for the Affirmative, it muſt needs follow, that if we love not God, it is becauſe he firſt loved not us.</p>

like a fond mother, who had rather venture to break her own heart, then her childs ſtomack. For God will make his ſons by adoption, like his Son by nature, whom he moſt loved, and yet he moſt ſcourged: He will make thoſe whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſave, like the Captain of their ſalvation by wearing a crown of thorns, before he will make them like him by wearing a crown of Glory. Hence happily it comes to paſs, that though we find many and great expoſtulations with God in the Old Teſtament, concerning the perſecutions of his Church, (as particularly, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 74. and <hi>Jer.</hi> the twelfth) Yet we ſcarſe find ſo much as a direct complaint (which is much leſs then an expoſtulation) concerning it, in all the New Teſtament. The reaſon is plain, that the Chriſtian Church might be taught by Chriſts Doctrine, as well as by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not to look to fare better then her Maſter; and ſure ſhe is, ſhe cannot fare worſe. Therefore is the Chriſtian Church in a manner aſhamed to ſay with <hi>David, Pſalm 74. 1. O God, why haſt thou caſt us off for ever?</hi> Since ſhe knows the Son of God himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> or with the Prophet, (Jer. 12. 1.) <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord when I plead with thee, yet let me talk with thee of thy judgements.</hi> Since ſhe knows Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>For the time is come that judgement muſt begin at the houſe of God,</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 17.) or again, with the ſame Prophet, <hi>Wherefore doth the way of the wicked proſper?</hi> Since Chriſt himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>this is your hour, and the power of darkneſs, (Luke</hi> 22 53.) Or laſtly, with the ſame Prophet, <hi>Wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherouſly?</hi> Since our bleſſed Saviour himſelf, had a Traytor among his own Apoſtles? and hath ſhewed us that true happineſs conſiſts not in having power to perſecute, but in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving patience to be perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake, <hi>Mat. 5. 10. Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven</hi> Chriſt himſelf was crucified between two theives, and thats reaſon enough why his Church ſhould not greatly complain, though ſhe be crucified, not only between, but alſo by two thieves. The one robbing God of his honour, the other of his Patrimony; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath given a hint of them both in one piece of a verſe, <hi>Rom. 2. 22.

For in truth, Idolatry and Sacriledge have a long time been the two grand ſcourges of the Chriſtian Church; Idolatry whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God out of his Temple, to let in other petty Dieties; and Sacriledge whipping him in it.

                           <p>I muſt needs confeſs that being in this Eden of God, in this Paradiſe contemplating the tree of life, I am unwilling to divert my eyes from that tree, and much more my heart from that contemplation; but am deſious to perſwade my ſelf, that I ſee the Prophet <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> viſion turned into action, and God acting it in heaven, no leſs then the Prophet acting it on earth, <hi>Iſa. 6. 8. Alſo, I heard the voice of the Lord ſaying, whom ſhall I ſend, or who will go for us? then I ſaid, here am I, ſend me.</hi> For God the Father did as it were conſult with himſelf, ſaying, <hi>whom ſhall I ſend?</hi> and God the Son did forthwith anſwer him, <hi>Here am I, ſend me.</hi> For as there was <hi>faciamus hominem, Gen.</hi> 1. 26. God conſulting and deliberating with his Son, (his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wiſdom) and with his Spirit, (his eternal power) about our creation; ſo there was <hi>redimamus hominem,</hi> God conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deliberating with his Son (his eternal righteouſneſs) and with his ſpirit (his eternal love) about our redemption: For Gods goodneſs is as infinite as himſelf, and that hath made him impart to man, not only his goodneſs, but alſo himſelf: Hence that ſaying of the ſublime <hi>Areopagite, quod ipſe Deus propter amorem eſt exſtaſin paſſus,</hi> That love made God as it were go out of himſelf: For great love is never without ſome kind of exſtaſie, and therefore as it makes man go out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and be not where he lives, but where he loves; ſo it alſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114933:38"/>
made God the Son, as it were; go out of himſelf, and come and be in man, whom he had loved with an eternal love. Thus hath love brought God from God to be in man: and thus ſhould it alſo bring man from man to be in God: For this is the end of that bleſſed Myſterie, and more bleſſed mercy which we commemorate when we celebrate the incarnation of the Son of God; he was made <hi>of us,</hi> that we might be new made <hi>by him;</hi> he made <hi>one fleſh</hi> with us, that we ſhould be <hi>one ſpirit</hi> with him. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> accounted it a great mercy, that God had ſent his Angel to deliver him from the hand of <hi>Herod, Act.</hi> 12. 11. How much more ought we to account it a great mercy, that he hath ſent his only Son to deliver us from the power of ſin and Satan, which perſued us much more fiercely, and would have wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us much more deſperately? He conſiders his deliverance, (<hi>ver.</hi> 12.) and ſhall not we? eſpecially ſince the Apoſtle hath ſhewed us the way how to enlarge this conſideration? <hi>Heb. 1. 1, 2. God who at ſundry times, and in divers maaners, ſpake in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi> It was a great mercy that he ſpake to the Fathers by holy men, a greater that he ſpake to them by the holy Angels (for that was one of the divers manners of his ſpeaking.) But the greateſt mercy of all was, that he hath ſpoken to us by his ſon; and the reaſon is intimated in the following words; for in time paſt was the beginning, the inchoation of his love, when he ſpake by his Prophets and Angels; but in theſe laſt dayes hath been the accompliſhment and conſummation of it, when he ſpake to us by his Son. Before, he had <hi>made the world and upheld all things by the word of his power;</hi> but now he hath <hi>redeemed the world, and having purged our ſins, upholds it by the hand of his mercy:</hi> For till our ſins were purged, it was only the power of God upheld the world, that he might purge it; But now our ſins are purged, tis the mercy of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the world, that he may ſave it: This is the only reaſon Saint <hi>Peter</hi> gives us why the laſt day, that ſhall deſtroy all things by fire, is ſo long in coming, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 9. The Lord is not ſlack, but is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> The ſame mercy that made him ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten his firſt coming, makes him delay his ſecond. And was it not a mercy, not only beyond our expreſſion, but alſo beyond our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114933:38"/>
admiration, that the Son of God, who was the brightneſs of his glory, ſhould become the brightneſs of his enemies, and the glory of his people? Yet ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 32. to be <hi>a light to lighten the Gentiles,</hi> there he was the Bridegroom of his enemies; and to be <hi>the glory of thy people Iſrael,</hi> there he was the glory of his own people.</p>
                           <p>It was a mercy that we could never deſerve, and therefore muſt ever acknowledge, that God was pleaſed to ſend his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to teach us his ſaving truth, and to ſhew the way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for they were the pillars of the Church, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9. But infinitely greater was the mercy that he pleaſed to ſend his own Son to teach the Apoſtles; for he is the cheif corner ſtone, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. For it is obſervable, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be accounted a pillar of the Church, and leaves it only for Chriſt to be called the chief corner ſtone; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Preface of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> which he once made in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Schools, <hi>Praefatio habita in gymnaſio Romano,</hi> and hath ſince prefixed before the third general controverſie of his firſt Tome, which is <hi>de ſummo Pontifice,</hi> had need of all the waters of <hi>Tiber</hi> to waſh it from groſs flattery, if not from deteſtable blaſphemy, ſince he is pleaſed therein to <hi>wreſt</hi> thoſe words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Behold I lay in Zion for a foundation, a ſtone, a tryed ſtone, a precious corner ſtone, a ſure foundation,</hi> and to apply them to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor, which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> durſt not apply unto himſelf, but leaves them only for Chriſt, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God.</p>
                           <p>We cannot too much prize the voice of the Apoſtles; as for example, Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles cannot be in too great eſteem, which (ſaith Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>) bring him every day more glory, as Chriſt more converts: But the voice of the eternal word, calling to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> from heaven, (<hi>Act.</hi> 9. 4, 5.) and in him to us, who can ever hear with ſufficient care and attention, who can embrace with ſufficient reverence and eſtimation, who can follow with ſufficient alacrity and devotion?</p>

                           <p>For delight cannot be but from ſome good that is convenient and preſent, and known to be ſo: <hi>Ad delectationem duo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runtur; conjunctio boni convenientis, &amp; cognitio hujus conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> ſaith the ſame <hi>Aquinas.</hi> A man cannot have delight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out two things; firſt the conjunction or acquiſition of ſome convenient good, then the knowledge of that conjunction; ſo is it in this caſe. The Redemption of our ſouls from death, is undoubtedly both a convenient and a preſent good; and yet few men have true joy and delight from it, becauſe few apprehend it as actually preſent. Wherefore it is the ſingular gift and love of God the Holy Ghoſt to any man, to give him the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Saviour, that he may give him the true joy of his ſalvation. For this indeed is the joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and comes only from him. It is he that teacheth the Church Militant to ſing a new ſong on earth for her joy in Chriſt: it is he that teacheth the Church Triumphant to ſing a new ſong in heaven for the ſame joy: <hi>O ſing unto the Lord a new ſong,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 98. and that <hi>Pſalm</hi> is nothing elſe but a ſong of Joy and Thankſgiving for the Redemption of mankind by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; there's the new ſong on earth; and again, <hi>Rev. 5. 9.

                           <p>WE cannot but have great joy, if we have true joy in our Redeemer: and we cannot but have true joy in our redeemer, if we rightly weigh and faithfully embrace the mercy of our redemption: therefore when the Holy Ghoſt hath ſaid, <hi>Let</hi> Iſrael <hi>rejoyce in him that made him,</hi> Pſal. 149. 2. he hath much more ſaid in effect, Let <hi>Iſrael</hi> rejoyce in him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed him: for the Joy is not ſo truly that he is made, as that he is made <hi>Iſrael:</hi> according to that of Saint <hi>Auguſtine, fruſtra profuit hominem naſci, niſi redimi etiam profuiſſet,</hi> in vain had man been made partaker of the Creation, if he had not alſo been made partaker of the redemption. And agreable to this is our Saviours doctrine concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> who in that he betrayed his redeemer, forfeited his ſhare in this redemption; <hi>It had been good for that man if he had not been born, Mat.</hi> 26. 24. To ſeek to make the contrary true by Metaphyſical quiddities, (as a Divine of late hath done) is ſo to be in Metaphyſicks as to be out of Divinity: for though ſingly and ſimply in it ſelf, <hi>being</hi> is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114933:45"/>
better then <hi>not being,</hi> yet a Metaphyſical being which only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts from nothing, accompanied with a moral not being that makes worſe then nothing, is certainly not better but far worſe then a bare Metaphyſical not being: for it is clearly better to be nothing, then to be worſe then nothing, and conſequently to be no ſoul at all, then to be a damned ſoul, under an eternal enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with and eternal ſeparation from that goodneſs which is the fountain of being, and which only doth make our being to be good: wherefore it muſt needs be a dangerous Poſition that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſuch a proof: but more dangerous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that admits it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For to admit this, is in effect to ſay, that our Saviour Chriſt is not a man of his word, as he that firſt broached this deſperate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, being urged with the authority of our Saviours fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned words, <hi>It had been good for that man if he had not been born,</hi> made his anſwer that our bleſſed Saviour did there ſpeak <hi>ſecundum captum vulgi,</hi> according to the opinion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people; which is little leſs then to put a fallacy in the mouth of Truth it ſelf, and to faſten ſuch a blaſphemy upon the word of Chriſt, as will eaſily enable us to elude the whole Text, and verifie his moſt wicked words by our more wicked practice, who once ſaid in zeal to his Church, but not to his Saviour, <hi>Scripturam eſſe naſum cereum,</hi> that the Scripture was a meer noſe of wax. But <hi>we have not ſo learned Chriſt,</hi> and dare not ſo revile his word, leaſt we ſhould ſo learn him; we will therefore rejoyce in him that made us out of nothing to be his creatures, becauſe he hath alſo redeemed us from being worſe then nothing, when we were his enemies: and we will <hi>commit the keeping of our ſouls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful creator,</hi> becauſe we know him to be alſo our merciful redeemer: <hi>For the ſame ſon of God who made the world, and upheld all things by the word of his Power,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently was our Creator, <hi>hath by himſelf purged our ſins, and is now ſat down on the right hand of the majeſty on high, there making interceſſion for us;</hi> (Heb. 1. 2, 3. &amp; Heb. 7. 25.) and conſequently is alſo our Redeemer: The joy of our Creation we have loſt by loſing our Innocency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Joy of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is never to be loſt, unleſs we loſe our Repentance; which is ſo true, ſo great a comfort to a man who is born in ſin, lives in ſin, dies in ſin, that if you deny him this, you can afford him no true comfort againſt his ſinfulneſs.</p>

Poſitive, becauſe we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace, and know that we are ſo: the right way to attain that knowledge.</head>
                           <p>THat would not be ſo great a comfort to a good Chriſtian which Saint Paul gives him, Rom. 6. 14. <hi>for ſin ſhall not have dominion over you,</hi> were not the reaſon of that a much greater comfort, <hi>for ye are not under the Law but under Grace:</hi> For they that groan under the oppreſſion of Tyrants, muſt needs be moſt glad to be delivered from their unjuſt and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful dominion; and here is that deliverance: for <hi>ſin</hi> (which is a greater tyrant over the ſoul, then any monſter of men can be over the body) <hi>ſhall not have dominion over you;</hi> but they that have once been under the dominion of tyrants, cannot be ſure they are delivered out of their hands, till they ſee themſelves actually under the righteous and merciful dominion of their own rightful Governours. And we may accordingly ſee that ſuch is our deliverance from the dominion of ſin, in that it is ſaid in the next words, <hi>for ye are not under the law, but under Grace:</hi> the ſpirit of Grace now reigns in you, and therefore will not let ſin raign any longer in you; nor the Law reign any longer over you, as it is the ſtrength of ſin to provoke it, or the judge of ſinners to condemn and to torment them: For if we lay not ſome ſuch reſtriction upon the Apoſtles words, we ſhall never be able to prove it is a mercy not to be under the Law; which is gloriouſly magnified by the Spirit of God, as that which giveth both holineſs and wiſdom, <hi>Pſal. 19. 17. The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul;</hi> there is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. <hi>The testimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple;</hi> there is the wiſdom: we muſt therefore ſay that the Law had a threefold uſe, <hi>to restrain, to condemn and to inſtruct;</hi> to reſtrain ſin, to condemn the ſinner, and to inſtruct in righteouſneſs.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="54" facs="tcp:114933:46"/>The power the Law had to condemn ſinners, and to wrack our conſciences before Gods judgement-ſeat, is taken away by Chriſt; ſo that they who truly lay hold on the Merit of Chriſt, are not thus under the Law, as condemning them: And thus not to be under the Law is an invaluable mercy, becauſe <hi>the Law worketh wrath, Rom.</hi> 4. 15. in ſhewing Gods wrath againſt ſinners, and us, as ſinners, ſubject to that wrath; But the power the Law had of reſtraining from ſin, and of inſtructing in righteouſneſs, ſtill remains uncontroled of God, and ſhould be undoubted and undiſputed of men: for he that gave to the <hi>Jew</hi> an inheritance on earth to have his Law kept, as tis ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 105. 43, 44. And gave them the Lands of the heathen, and they took the labours of the people in poſſeſſion, that they might keep his ſtatutes and obſerve his Laws,</hi> hath not promiſed to the Chriſtian an inheritance in heaven, to have his Law broken.</p>
                           <p>Therefore the Law muſt ſtill reſtrain us from ſin, and direct us in righteouſneſs, only with this difference: The power it hath of reſtraining us from ſin, grows leſs and leſs every day in the regenerate, and can remain no longer then this life, becauſe ſin it ſelf in them ſhall remain no longer: But the power the Law hath to inſtruct and direct in righteouſneſs, grows day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more, and is as immortal as righteouſneſs it ſelf, and can never be aboliſhed, neither in this life, nor in the life everlaſting: <hi>for it is eaſier for heaven and earth to paſs, then one tittle of the Law to fail,</hi> Luke 16. 17. Nay the <hi>Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, (2 Pet.</hi> 3. 10.) But this power of the Law ſhall not paſs away; for it follows <hi>ver.</hi> 13. that in the <hi>new heavens dwelleth righteouſneſs:</hi> And if righteouſneſs dwell there, then alſo the Law which is the rule thereof: for it is not poſſible that any creature ſhould have its own will, but only the will of God for the rule of righteouſneſs, on which will it muſt as neceſſarily depend for its doing, as for its being, ſince nothing can be independent in its working, which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent in its being: and he only is independent in his being, who is wholly in, and of, and for himſelf; that is, God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever; who is the efficient and final cauſe of all things, the efficient cauſe by whom, the final cauſe for whom they are, and were created. In a word, the regulating power of the Law cannot be aboliſhed, for that ſhall ſtill remain in heaven;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114933:46"/>
the reſtraining power of the Law is not aboliſhed, but only chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in that true faith makes us more obedient for love, then the Law for fear: and the condemning power of the Law ſhall never be aboliſhed, for it ſhall ſtill reign over the damned ſouls in hell, and breed the worm of conſcience that dyeth not: And yet tis this condemning power of the Law that we are chiefly redeemed from; not that the power of condemning is taken from the Law, but that we are taken from its condemnation; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is therefore now no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> He ſaith not, There is no condemnation from the Law, but he ſaid, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them which are in Chriſt; becauſe they that are in Chriſt do in him fulfil the Law, and ſo cannot be under the condemnation of it. For though they perform not that legal obedience which is able to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, yet they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that Evangelical obedience which is undoubtedly accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his mercy: Their obedience though not worth acceptance in it ſelf, yet is very well accepted in Chriſt; and that makes them that are in Chriſt ſo exceedingly ſtrive to ſhew themſelves dutiful and obedient, becauſe no other are made the Sons of God in Chriſt, but only thoſe who are made obedient to him by his Spirit.</p>
                           <p>And they truly are under grace, becauſe they truly are under Chriſt, the fountain of grace; for <hi>grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt, John. 1. 17. Gratia dupliciter dicitur, uno modo ipſa voluntas Dei gratis aliquid dantis; alio modo ipſum gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itum donum Dei,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aquinas, 3a. 2. 10. cap.</hi> Grace hath two ſignifications; Firſt, it is taken for the love of God; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is taken for the gift of that love: and accordingly he that is under Grace, is partaker of both theſe, both of Gods love, and of Gods free gift proceeding from that love: And the latter is the infallible demonſtration of the former, the gift is the demonſtration of the love. For grace as it is the love of God, is the cauſe of no Religious operations in the ſoul, but as it is the gift of Gods love: and therefore this phraſe <hi>ye are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace,</hi> doth not bid us look up to Gods decree, but look down upon our own ſouls, to ſee if we can find there ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious habits as may cauſe thoſe Religious operations which are the undoubted evidences and effects of the gift of grace, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114933:47"/>
therefore the undoubted evidences, becauſe the undoubted effect of it: For grace as it is the gift of God in the ſoul, works not immediately by it ſelf, or by its own eſſence, but by virtuous habits as by its inſtruments; and therefore theſe have the leaſt reaſon to boaſt of grace, who leaſt regard the virtuous habits whereby it worketh, and ſo cry up Faith in Chriſt, as in effect to beat down the cheifeſt duties of Chriſtianity: For grace is the beginning of ſpiritual actions, by the mediation of virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits, even as the ſoul is the beginning of vital actions by the mediation of its powers and faculties; And as the ſoul works not immediately from it ſelf the actions of the natural life: ſo neither doth grace work immediately of it ſelf the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſpiritual life. For grace indeed hath two acts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſoul, as the ſoul hath in regard of the body; <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ad eſſe, Secundus ad operari.</hi> The firſt act is to give life, and that is immediate from it ſelf; the ſecond act is to give the operations of life, and that is mediate, by virtuous qualities and diſpoſitions; ſo neerly doth it concern every Chriſtian that deſires to be under grace, to lead his life in all Godlineſs and vertue: for there can be no aſſurance of life, but from the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of life; no aſſurance of the ſpiritual being, but from the evidence of the ſpiritual working: Excellently, <hi>Aquinas, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt aliquis cognoſcere ſe habere gratiam in quantum percipit ſe delectari in Deo, &amp; contemnit res mundanas, &amp; non eſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ſibi alicujus mortalis peccati, 1a. 2ae. 112. 5. cap.</hi> A man may know himſelf to be in grace, if he find that he delights in God, and contemns this world, and is not conſcious to himſelf of any grievous or mortal ſin. There are but few ſigns or tokens, but they are infallible; And we muſt conclude that thoſe men who care not what ſins they commit againſt God, their brethren and their own conſciences, either to get or to keep the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this world, as they ſhew but little contempt of the world, ſo they ſhew a great contempt of God: And they that contemn God, cannot be ſaid to delight in him: and they that do not delight in him, cannot receive comfort from him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an evil ſpirit, not the ſpirit of God which doth witneſs to ſuch men that they are the Sons of God, when their own conſciences cannot but witneſs that they are his enemies.</p>

                           <p>MAny men have a cheerful countenance, that have but a ſorrowful heart; The yong man ſeems to be of this temper, whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſo ſharply reproves, or rather ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derides, <hi>Eccleſ. 11. 9. Rejoyce O yong man in thy youth, and walk in the wayes of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes:</hi> there is cheerfulneſs enough as to the outward man; <hi>but know thou, that for all theſe things, God will bring thee into judgement;</hi> There's ſorrowfulneſs more then enough, as to the inward man: whilſt walking in his own wayes, makes him lift up his face; the thought of judgement cannot but caſt down his heart: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they alone do truly rejoyce, who have ſuch a joy as cannot end in ſorrow: not a joy for being the Lords over their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but a joy for being the ſervants of their God: not a joy for overcoming others, but for overcoming themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not a joy for having gained an inheritance on earth, but a joy for being aſſured of an inheritance in heaven. Our Saviour ſaid to his own Diſciple, <hi>Notwithſtanding in this rejoyce not, that the Spirits are ſubject unto you; but rather rejoyce becauſe your names are written in Heaven, Luke</hi> 10. 20. If it be not the cauſe of a true Chriſtians joy to have power and dominion over evil ſpirits, which is the peculiar priviledge of Chriſts own Church: much leſs can it be the cauſe of a true Chriſtian joy to have dominion and power over good men, which is the common priviledge of Chriſts enemies.</p>
                           <p>The joy then of a Chriſtian is not for having his name far ſpread on earth, but for having his name written in heaven; not for overcoming his Brother, but for overcoming his luſts: <hi>And to him that thus overcometh, will he that holdeth the ſeven Stars in his right hand, and walketh in the midſt of the ſeven golden Candleſticks, give to eat of the hidden Manna,</hi>

(<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.) which without doubt affords a marvellous ſweetneſs to all thoſe that eat of it.</p>
                           <p>But who can eat of this heavenly Manna, ſave only they who have their names written in heaven? for <hi>it is not meet to take the childrens bread, and to caſt it unto the dogs, (Mark</hi> 7 27.) Nor can the dogs eat ſo much as the crumbs that fall from this heavenly table. We muſt be children before we can eat of this bread; and then may we not always expect to eat our fill of it, leaſt that Scripture be fulfilled of us the ſecond time, <hi>He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel againſt me.</hi> John 13. 18. <hi>For Jeſurun waxed fat and kicked; then he forſook God which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made him, and lightly eſteemed the rock of his ſalvation, Deut.</hi> 32. 15. Therefore do the moſt judicious Divines adviſe us, that though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſtedfaſtly believe our ſelves to be Gods adopted Sons, yet we may not too ſuddenly make ſure of our inheritance, but muſt work out our <hi>ſalvation with fear and trembling, Phil.</hi> 2. 12. And though we be indeed <hi>the called of Jeſus Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 1. 6. yet we muſt <hi>give diligence to make our calling and election ſure, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 10. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is very zealous in this point, as by his own ſad experience, having known the miſcheif of too much confidence: And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words, there be reaſon enough <hi>for our fear and trembling, becauſe our ſalvation</hi> is to be worked out, before it can be enjoyed, (for no man but hath cauſe more then enough to ſuſpect his own works, and much more the continuance of his good working,) yet Saint <hi>Peter</hi> gives us another reaſon of our fear, becauſe we muſt all be judged, before we can be ſaved, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 17.

of his favour towards us, that the fear of Gods judgement may humble us; that the preſumption of our own ſecure ſtate and condition may not ruine us; and that the deſire of Gods grace may daily more and more increaſe in us; All theſe three reaſons are intimated by Saint <hi>Peter, If ye callon the Father;</hi> there's the deſire of the increaſe of grace; <hi>who without reſpect of perſons, judgeth according to every mans works;</hi> there's the fear of Gods judgement; <hi>paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear</hi> there's againſt the preſumption of our own ſecure ſtate and condition: As then I deſire to be humbled, as I deſire not to be eternally ruined, and as I would increaſe in my ſoul more and more ſuch holy deſires, ſo I muſt take heed that I be not puffed up with the conceit of my adoption; for he that hath given me that ineſtimable grace, when I did not deſerve it, hath not promiſed to continue his gift if I will needs abuſe it.</p>

The firſt degree of our adoption the world knows not of us; the ſecond, we do not, cannot, in this life, fully know of our ſelves: Of the firſt degree of adoption ſpeaks the ſame Saint <hi>John</hi> in his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>John 1. 12, 13. As many as received him, to them gave he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114933:49"/>
power to become the Sons of God:</hi> Of the ſecond degree ſpeaks Saint <hi>Paul, Rom. 8. 23. We our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit the redemption of our body;</hi> as if the adoption were not to be obtained here, but to be expected hereafter; wherein however he ſpeaks as it were out of Chriſts own mouth, as well as by his ſpirit; for our bleſſed Saviour himſelf uſeth theſe words, <hi>Luke 20. 36. They are the children of God, being the children of the reſurrection;</hi> not that they were not the children of God before, but only that they were not compleatly and perfectly children, till they were admitted to their inheritance, and were come to a full ſimilitude and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with their Father. For as a natural ſon of man is partaker of his humane nature, or elſe he cannot be his ſon; ſo alſo is an adopted Son of God, partaker of his Divine Nature; though not Originally, becauſe he is adopted; yet ſure derivatively, becauſe elſe he cannot be a Son: for on the participation or communication of the Divine nature is founded our adoption, or being the Sons of God, according to that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 4. That by theſe you might be partakers of the Divine Nature, <gap reason="foreign">

And upon this ground it is we do aſſert, that as the participation of the Divine nature to us is different in degrees, ſo alſo is our adoption different in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as inchoate in this life, and conſummate only in the next. For in this life we are made partakers of the Divine Nature but inchoately and imperfectly, that is, as it is reſembled in grace; but in the next life we ſhall be made partakers of it conſummate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or perfectly, that is, as it will be revealed in glory: For there is in man a threefold Image of God, <hi>Imago creationis, Imago recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis, Imago ſimilitudinis,</hi> as ſaith the angelical Doctor, (1 <hi>2ae. qu. 93. ar.</hi> 4.) The firſt Image is by likeneſs of Nature, the Image of creation; the ſecond, is by likeneſs of grace, the Image of regeneration; the third Image, is by likeneſs of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Image of perfection. Tbe firſt Image hath been ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced and blotted, and ſlurred by our ſin, that we are all by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the children of wrath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3. So that in and from this Image of God in us ariſeth only the neceſſity or want of adoption; for there is only ſo much of it left as to ſhew how
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114933:50"/>
great need we have to be made his children, that we may be made more like him then we are by nature. But the adoption it ſelf is founded in our new begotten Image or likeneſs with our heavenly Father, which is after the ſimilitude of his only Son, by Grace in this world, and by glory in the world to come; and may accordingly be called either incompleat or compleat adoption: Concerning the firſt Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>that we are made the Sons of God,</hi> as being already partakers of the Divine nature in the likeneſs of grace; concerning the ſecond he ſaith, <hi>It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him;</hi> that is, we ſhall hereafter be made the Sons of God after a more perfect manner, by being made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the divine nature in the likeneſs of glory: Bleſſed be that eternal Son, in whom we are made Sons; and bleſſed be that day wherein he took on him our nature, that he might give us his.</p>

                           <p>THE Spirit of adoption, though it were given under the Law, yet was it not ſo fully given, as it is now under the Goſpel. For though it were the ſame Covenant of Grace to the Jew and to the Chriſtian, to be ſaved by Chriſt, yet was this Covenant much different in the manner of its adminiſtration: And therefore we muſt conſider the Church before Chriſt came in the fleſh, though as an <hi>heir</hi> that had a right (from Gods fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, though not from his ſtrict Juſtice) to all Spiritual Gifts and Graces whatſoever, yet withal as an <hi>infant</hi> that had not the full poſſeſſion of that right: And this diſtinction Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf teacheth us, <hi>Gal. 4. 1.

As ſhe was an heir, ſhe had the Spirit of adoption; but as ſhe was an infant, ſhe had the Spirit of fear and bondage; which makes the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Rom. 8. 15. For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again,</hi> (ye had it once, <hi>ſc.</hi> whiles ye were under the Law, but ye have it not again, <hi>ſc.</hi> now ye are under the Goſpel) <hi>to fear; but ye have received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> Hence it is that the Jews had then the ſame ſpiritual bleſſings in dark repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and figures, which we Chriſtians now have in full revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſubſtance: I will ſet down ſome few examples concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chiefeſt ſpiritual bleſsings, by which we may eaſily be able to judge of all the reſt, and not be miſtaken in our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

VII.</hi> A particular time appointed for rejoycing in Chriſt, not by way of reſtriction, but by way of Application: The Chriſtians Joy far above the Jews, both for his Redemption and for his Adoption. The priviledge of true Faith. And how the Redemption by Chriſt is larger then the Adoption by him. And the Adoption greater in his giving, then in our receiving.</head>
                           <p>TO be glad in the Lord and to rejoyce in him, makes Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs laſt all the year, yet is that no better reaſon why we ſhould not keep Chriſtmaſs-Day, then our reſt and contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in God, which we have or may have all the week, is a reaſon why we ſhould not keep the Sabbath, or the Lords own day: for it is very bad Logick, and worſe Divinity, which argues from the poſition of the Duty, to the everſion of the Day wherein we ought to exerciſe it; for if the Duty muſt be exerciſed, how can we reaſonably deny the time of its exerciſe? Yet do I not think that a particular time is to be allotted to rejoyce in Chriſt by way of reſtriction or limitation, as if we ſhould not rejoyce in him at other times; (for that is the malignant gloſs which ſome of late have put upon the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, confining Gods ſolemn publick worſhip only to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, not conſidering that the Jews had other grand feſtivals, not preſcribed in the Law, and yet were more ſtrictly bound to the letter of that Commandment, then we Chriſtians) but I ſay that a particular Time ought to be allotted to rejoyce in Chriſt by way of application or of ſpecification, that we may more eminently and notoriouſly rejoyce in him at ſome time,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114933:52"/>
though our joy in him is to be confined to no time: For the ſpiritual joy of the Jew was unconfined, and much more the ſpiritual joy of the Chriſtian, who in a larger proportion hath received the Spirit of joy.</p>
                           <p>And therefore its obſervable, that though in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are earneſtly called upon to rejoyce in God, yet are we not called upon for ſo much joy as in the New Teſtament; let this one inſtance ſerve for all: <hi>Be glad in the Lord and rejoyce ye righteous, and ſhout for joy all ye that are upright in heart;</hi> ſo the Prophet concludeth the 32. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and in the ſame ſtrain beginneth the 33. ſaying, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord O ye righteous, for praiſe is comely for the upright,</hi> calling for a very great propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Joy from the Jew; but yet the Apoſtle in ſaying, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord alway, again I ſay rejoyce, Phil.</hi> 4. 4. hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for a far greater proportion of joy from the Chriſtian; For here is not only the ſame joy that was before, to wit joy in the Lord, but here is the ſame joy in a greater degree of extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for he ſaith, <hi>rejoyce in the Lord alway;</hi> and in a greater degree of intenſion, for he ſaith, <hi>again I ſay rejoyce:</hi> And if we further conſider who are called the juſt and righteous, and upon what terms they are called ſo, we ſhall find alſo a greater degree of extenſion, for that where is the greateſt meaſure and diffuſion of righteouſneſs, there muſt needs be the greateſt meaſure and diffuſion of joy: And it is evident that they who truſt in the Lord (not in themſelves) are by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> called the juſt and the righteous, or the upright; For it is the priviledge of true faith not only to make us juſt, but alſo to make us upright; not only to juſtifie us, but alſo to rectifie us; it juſtifies us in that it abſolves from ſin; it rectifies us, in that it directs in righteouſneſs; and therefore the diſobedient as well as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing heart, the ſtubborn as well as the faithleſs generation is ſaid not to truſt in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 7, 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the faithleſs gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is there known as well by this Character, <hi>that ſet not their heart aright,</hi> as by this, <hi>whoſe ſpirit was not ſtedfaſt with God:</hi> For true faith hath the priviledge firſt to ſet the heart to God, then to ſettle it in God; firſt to make the ſpirit right, then to make it ſtedfaſt: The heart is made right when it points di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards God, moving as a line from the circumference to the Center; and the heart is thus made right, or ſet towards
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114933:52"/>
God, by the ſame faith that it is made ſtedfaſt or ſettled in God; Wherefore ſince true faith at the ſame time both Rectifies and Juſtifies the ſoul of man, it is no wonder if it cauſe its unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as well as its unmoveable joy: And where ſhall we look for this true faith, if not in Chriſtians? for though the act of faith is as expreſly ſet down in the Old Teſtament as in the New; yet the object of faith is much more plainly declared in the New Teſtament: So that Chriſtians having a more perfect faith in Chriſt then had the Jews, muſt needs have a greater joy in Chriſt then they could have.</p>
                           <p>And indeed, what joy like the joy of the Redeemed by Chriſt, or rather what joy like the joy of the adopted in Chriſt, Since the joy of the Redemption is not to be had without the joy of the Adoption? For many more have been Redeemed by Chriſt, then do truly rejoyce in him; becauſe many more have been Redeemed, then are adopted: For the Redemption which man hath by Chriſt, is of a greater latitude then is the Adoption; becauſe the Redemption concerns all mankind in general, but the Adoption is reſtrained to ſome particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; <hi>ſc.</hi> to thoſe only within the Pale of the Church; and that not only in their number and outward profeſſion, but alſo in their merit or inward affection, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath laid the ground of that diſtinction, 22<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And theſe two may very well agree, that the Redemption it ſelfe ſhould be univerſal, and concern the whole nature of man, which Chriſt aſſumed, and therefore redeemed; but yet the benefit thereof in the adoption of ſons, ſhould be onely particular, that is concerne thoſe alone to whom God doth give ſpecial grace to make a right uſe of Chriſt; nay concerning adoption it ſelfe Saint Paul ſeems to ſpeake as if it were in ſome kind a potential, and not all together an actual bleſſing or mercy, when he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>AS there is no greater comfort then the comfort of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, ſo there is not a more comfortable, if there be a more evident, teſtimony to aſſure us thereof, then that moſt holy prayer which our bleſſed Saviour hath ſanctified by his lips, no leſs then he hath commanded and commended in his Word: For this prayer teacheth us to ſay to God, <hi>Our Father,</hi> which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114933:53"/>
cannot be true and right in the Invocation, if it be not true and right in the Doctrine: for if it be not an undoubted truth that God in Chriſt is <hi>Our Father,</hi> then can we not truly in our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip call him ſo: Wherefore ſince we are taught by Truth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to call God Father in our worſhip, we are ſure it muſt be true in our Doctrine, That God is our Father in Chriſt, and conſequently we his adopted Sons; or we muſt aſſert the ſame Thing to be a Truth and not a Truth: a Truth in our Prayer, and not a Truth in our Belief; and moreover ſay, That we pray in Faith, when we do not pray in Truth: For if we pray not in faith we ſin; and we cannot pray in Faith, if there be an untruth in our Prayers: Wherefore this expreſsion <hi>Our Father,</hi> being recommended to us by our Saviours own mouth, as it teacheth us to pray in his Communion in and through whom we are adopted, ſo it affordeth us an undoubted teſtimony and proof of our Adoption; for under what pretence can we ſay to God <hi>Our Father,</hi> if we be not his ſons? and how are we his ſons, ſo as to expect any bleſsing from him, but only by the grace of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption? Accordingly as we cannot but ſay, (with Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>) that all other prayers are reducible to the matter of this ſhort prayer: ſo we may likewiſe ſay with him, (for he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth not one precedent or petition which is not immediatly directed unto God) that all other prayers are reducible to this form of ſaying <hi>Our Father;</hi> and by this rule, thoſe prayers which rather ſay <hi>Our Brother,</hi> then <hi>Our Father which art in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> cannot be ſaid in Faith, and do not proceed from the Spirit of Adoption; and they that ſo pray, do not communicate with Chriſt in their prayers, who neither prayed himſelf, nor taught us to pray to any but only to his Father: And it is not ſapient nor ſafe for us to pray out out of Chriſts communion, ſince we are ſure our prayers will not be heard, but through his Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                           <p>Yet in all probability, that humour of praying to petty Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if it did not at firſt help to thruſt out the concluſion of this prayer, yet it hath ſince helped to keep it out, becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any colour of truth ſay to any but to God alone, <hi>for thine is the Kingdom, the power and the glory for ever and ever:</hi> For this Doxologie is without doubt the concluſion of the Lords prayer in Saint <hi>Matthews.</hi> Goſpel, as it hath been generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114933:54"/>
both by the Greek and the Latine Church, neither of which hath ſet down that prayer in Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel in Greek, without the addition of theſe words at the end of it: and for that allegation that it is not ſo in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> it is of no force, ſince it is againſt that common maxime, <hi>Argumentum ab authoritate non valet negativè,</hi> An Argument from authority is worth nothing in the negative, but only in the affirmative: and we ſhould loſe very much of the Goſpel, if we ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge and blot that out of one Evangeliſt, which we cannot find in another: Yet ſome Criticks have gone ſo far as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the world, That this heavenly concluſion did not at all belong to the Lords prayer, but is both an unneceſſary and an unwarrantable addition: One is pleaſed to call it a foppery, (<hi>non veriti ſunt tàm divinae precationi ſuas nugas aſſuere</hi>) If this Doxologie be a foppery, then what is true wiſdom? but if it be indeed true wiſdom, then what is this cenſure of it, but plain blaſphemy? And is not that true wiſdom, which proceeded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the mouth of the eternal wiſdom? Yet the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> complieth ſo far with thoſe that have oppoſed this Doxologie, as to perſwade himſelf it came at firſt out of the Greek Liturgies into the Bible, not conſidering that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be allowed ſuch chopping and changing of the Text, but we muſt reproach the Catholick Church of Chriſt firſt as uncareful in ſuffering ſuch changes, then as unfaithful in obtruding them for Text; Firſt as uncareful, in ſuffering men to make havock of Gods Word which was committed to her charge to keep; then as unfaithful, in obtruding the Word of man upon us, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Word of God; and what authority or repute will be left to the Church, if we ſuppoſe her to want both care and truſt? for God intruſted his Church with his Holy Word, that ſhe ſhould firſt faithfully keep it, and after that faithfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it; wherefore to ſay the Church hath falſified her truſt in keeping Gods Word, is in effect to ſay, ſhe is not truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to interpret it: which is bring all Religion to doubts and uncertainties in the knowledge: to ſchiſms and diviſions in the practice thereof. For ſurely if the Lords own moſt holy prayer hath been ſo ill kept by the Church, which in all ages hath been looked upon as the ſum of the Goſpel, and as the plat-form, or rather the ground-work of all true Religion, then
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114933:54"/>
we muſt needs have but very little or no aſſurance concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt of the Scriptures: wherefore it concerns all Chriſtian Divines in the firſt place to vindicate the Church of Chriſt, concerning her faithful keeping of this Prayer, which would have been altogether needleſs, had not ſome Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of later years obtruded their own obſervations for various Lections, and by that means not cleared the Text but puzzled it: But let us ask them, Are the unknown manuſcrips, or the known and received Copies of the Church to be taken for the Text? If the former, we truſt private men and private ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which God never entruſted with his word: If the latter, we have as unqueſtionable a Lords Prayer, as if we had heard it immediately from his own mouth: For we have it thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly delivered us by the Greek and the Latine Church, in the undoubted Originals of Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel. For the Greek Church, let Saint <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> ſpeak, who hath ſo elegantly and ſo exactly expounded at this Doxology, in his nineteenth Homily upon Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> plainly ſhewing the neceſſary connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof to the laſt Petition of the Lords Prayer, that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he accounted it as a part of the Prayer, though as no part of the Petitions; for (ſaith he) Our Saviour having told us of that evil one which we were to fight againſt, (for ſo he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114933:55"/>
end with the praiſe of God, after the example of the Lords own Prayer, (<hi>habes hoc in oratione Dominica, &amp;c.</hi>) doth in effect allow the Doxology to be the end of that Prayer, ſince it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Deliver us from evil, is no matter of praiſe; nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he doth rather alledge it in ſenſe, though not in words, in ſaying that the prieſt concludes with ſuch a form of praiſe, as is in truth no other then an expoſition of this Doxology, only applied to all three Perſons of the bleſſed Trinity: <hi>Per Dominum noſtrum Jeſum Chriſtum, in quo tibi eſt, cum quo tibi eſt honor, laus, gloria, magnificentia, poteſtas cum Spiritu Sancto, à ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis &amp; nunc &amp; ſemper, &amp; in omnia ſecula ſeculorum.</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if that be a good Argument why we ſhould leave the Doxology or the concluſion out of the Lords Prayer in Saint <hi>Matth.</hi> (becauſe it is not in the Vulgar Latine) it muſt be as good an argument why we ſhould leave the introduction and the laſt petition out of the ſame Prayer in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> for there in the Latine tranſlation is no mention of <hi>noſter qui es in coelis,</hi> nor of <hi>libera nos à malo:</hi> whereas the Greek Text gives us that Prayer with its concluſion in Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the ſame Prayer not mangled but whole and entire, though without its concluſion in Saint <hi>Luke;</hi> and there is no greater reaſon, but only ſome mens bold conjectures, to ſay that the concluſion of that Prayer was added to the Greek Text in Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> then to ſay that the introduction and laſt Petition of it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Greek Text in Saint <hi>Luke;</hi> for both alike are left out of the Latine tranſlation: But though they have been both left out of the Bibles by the Latine tranſlation, yet we cannot ſay that either hath been left out of the Bibles by the Latine Church; For the Greek copies of Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, this day agnized by the Latine Church, are ready to depoſe the contrary, all of them having the Doxology annexed to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, as the concluſion to its premiſſes, without any the leaſt interruption, and then at laſt adding' A <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore it is evident that this Prayer both in its Petitions and in its concluſion, hath
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114933:55"/>
alwaies been received as an unqueſtionable part of Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> Goſpel, both by the Greek and the Latine Churches; and conſequently thoſe men have diſparaged the Church of Chriſt, and diſadvantaged the Chriſtian Religion, who have either commenced or continued, either begun or maintained any quarrels againſt this moſt holy Prayer, either in it ſelf, or in its uſe: Nay, in truth ſuch men have diſparaged and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantaged themſelves; for cavilling with that Prayer which ſo plainly teacheth them to ſay Our Father, muſt needs be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an ill ſign that they have received, and a worſe means, that they may retain the adoption of Sons: Surely Saint <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> who whipped thoſe Sectaries with ſcourges that refuſed to communicate with Chriſts Church, as not caring by their obedience to ſay Our mother, would further have whipped them with ſcorpions, had they refuſed to communicate with Chriſt himſelf, as abhorring in their Prayers, to ſay Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And doubleſs it may reaſonably be demanded of us, with what certainty of faith, or ſatisfaction of conſcience we do communicate with them in their Prayers, who will not communicate with Chriſt in his Prayer? And how we ſhall anſwer it to our Saviour, when he ſhall come to be our Judge, that we have indeed renounced his Prayer, and have given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſober men to fear that we have alſo renounced his Communion? ſince it is evident, that no man can renounce his Prayer, but muſt alſo by conſequence renounce his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: But let Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeak to this argument, that we may be ſure to have a good ſpokeſman, who in his Book <hi>de Oratione Dominica,</hi> ſaith thus: <hi>Qui facit vivere, docuit &amp; orare, ut dum prece &amp; Oratione quam filius docuit apud Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem loquimur, facilius audiamur: He that made us to live, taught us to pray, that ſpeaking to the Father in the words of his Son, we might be ſure not to ſpeak in vain:</hi> Again, <hi>Que enim poteſt eſſe magis Spiritalis oratio, quàm quae vere à Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

they continue heartily praying for themſelves, that ſo they may have the benefit of his interceſſion: For as far as we are made partakers of Chriſt, ſo far can we truly in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and with his Spirit, ſay unto God <hi>Our Father:</hi> For the right of filiation belongs Originally to Chriſt, and but dirivatively to us: He is the Son of God in himſelf, we are the Sons of God in and through him; and tis happy for us that we are ſo; for elſe we could not but fear the loſs of our adoption, as often as we did find the loſs of our obedience: For there can be no aſſurance of ſuch an adoption as ſhall laſt till we be inſtated in our inheritance, from our ſelves, but only from our Saviour Chriſt: God indeed is pleaſed to call good men his ſons; but none was ever called the Son of God, with this promiſe and Prerogative, that God alwaies was and alwaies would be his Father, but only Chriſt: or elſe Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Argument would loſe much of its ſtrength, when he proves our Saviour Chriſt to be above all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, becauſe God had not ſaid to any of them, but had ſaid only to him, <hi>Thou art my Son;</hi> And again, <hi>I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son:</hi> For Angels and men are ſo the Sons of God, as to be his Sons in Chriſt, not in themſelves; and therefore no ſooner nor no longer his ſons then they were and are in Chriſt: For which cauſe we can be no farther ſure of our adoption in Chriſt, then we are ſure of our conjunction and communion with him: and that not of a corporal conjunction in the ſame fleſh, but of a ſpiritual conjunction in the ſame Spirit: For our corporal conjunction with Chriſt doth not only make us ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being adopted in him; but it is our ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with him that gives unto us the ſeal and benefit of our adoption whereby we are joyned with Chriſt in the ſame myſtical body here, and ſhall be joyned with him in the ſame glorious body hereafter: Thus may every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſaith with Saint <hi>Paul, Phil. 1. 21.

to ſcan it; And they differ, (ſaith he) in theſe two particulars. 1.

Divine truths, is this, that we know them in a right order, with a right zeal, and for a right end; The right order is to know that firſt which firſt procureth ſalvation: The right zeal is to deſire to know that moſt which moſt enflameth our affections: And the right end is to uſe all our knowledge to edification; and in theſe three reſpects the knowledge of Chriſt in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, doth challenge our beſt endeavours that we may gain it, and our greateſt contentedneſs when we have gained it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this knowledge doth moſt procure our ſalvation, moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our affections, moſt conduce to our edification: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he <hi>determined not to know any thing among them, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 2.

And laſtly, not to know any thing but with relation and ſubordination to Chriſt crucified; for he would have that knowledge chiefeſt in their aims and intentions, which alone could make all other knowledge tend to theit edification; And ſuch was the knowledge of Chriſt crucified; for if Chriſts Croſs paſs not through the whole Alphabet of our Divinity, all the words we can uſe will ſignifie nothing to a ſin-ſick ſoul, which muſt firſt be healed, (and what balm can heal a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirit, but only the blood of Chriſt?) before it can be ſaved: yea though we ſpeak with the tongues of men and Angels, and ſhew not this charity, this love of our Saviour to our periſhing ſouls, we ſhall become but as ſounding braſs, or as tinkling Cymbals, make a great noiſe to very little or ſmall purpoſe: Therefore doth an excellent late Divine, (<hi>Zanchys</hi> by name)

                              <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Chriſt ſet down in the Scripture as our Propitiation, under the title of the Paſchal Lamb; and how many excellent Doctrines and Comforts of Chriſtianity are to be learned from that title.</head>
                           <p>MEN and Angels might ſtand amazed to ſee ſo much mercy where they had ſeen ſo little innocency, were it not that they could not but ſee ſo much merit, where they had ſeen ſo much mercy. No wonder then if this mercy was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our doings, when the merit was according to his doings and ſufferings, <hi>who died for our ſins, and roſe again to make us righteous: He is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter,</hi> ſaid the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſome hundred of years before he was actually ſlain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 7. But he comes nearer the fountain-head of this mercy, who telleth us of the <hi>Lamb that was ſlain before the foundation of the world, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 20. Wherefore we muſt needs confeſs that the Church of Chriſt well knew the powerful invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and deſired we ſhould find the comfortable perſwaſion of this mercy thus purchaſed for us, when it thus taught us to pray for it, <hi>O Lamb of God that takeſt away the ſins of the world, have mercy upon us:</hi> For the Son of God was called the Lamb of God for no other reaſon, but becauſe he was ſlain as a ſacrifice to take away the ſins of men: And if we ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Paſchal Lamb and our Saviour Chriſt both together, in the moſt remarkable circumſtances, we ſhall then ſee how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly our bleſſed Saviour was called the Lamb of God. Firſt the Paſchal Lamb was one of the flock, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 5. So Chriſt was one of us, and dwelt among us, Saint <hi>John 1. 14. And the word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us;</hi> This conſideration, That <hi>the word was made fleſh,</hi> as it may inflame our devotions becauſe our Saviour is in our own fleſh to pitty us, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us; ſo it muſt cool and allay our diſtempers, That he is in that ſame fleſh which we ſo eaſily ſuffer in our ſelves to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively paſſionate, and either diſtracted by ſinful factions, or diſtempered by ſinful affections: So that now what ſins I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114933:65"/>
in the fleſh, I commit not only againſt that fleſh which in my ſelf goes creeping and growling on the earth; but alſo againſt that fleſh, which in my Saviour is exalted into heaven, and there ſitteth at the right hand of God: This is the Apoſtles moſt pathetical argument againſt all the ſins of uncleanneſs, and ſhould be mine in the like caſe or temptation, <hi>Know you not that your bodies are the members of Chriſt? Shall I then take the members of Chriſt and make them the members of an Harlot? God forbid, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 15. as if he had ſaid, I muſt abandon &amp; abhor all uncleanneſſes of the fleſh, in that thereby I ſhall ſin againſt mine own body; How much more in that thereby I ſhall ſin againſt my Saviours body?</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the Paſchal Lamb was without blemiſh; ſo Chriſt was without ſin, the only ſpot and blemiſh of the ſoul; <hi>In pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato ſunt reatus &amp; macula,</hi> ſaith the School: All ſin as it brings a guiltineſs with it, ſo it leaves a ſpot and blemiſh after it: Our Saviour Chriſt was without this ſpot, and we muſt labour to be without it likewiſe, by being made conformable to him: So ſhould we rightly underſtand the hidden myſterie of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, more by our practiſe then we can poſsibly by our ſpeculations or diſputes, if every one of us would really endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to fulfill that part of it, <hi>To be conformed to the image of his Son;</hi> Rom. 8. 29. <hi>For whom he did fore-know, he alſo did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son:</hi> The great quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of Chriſtendom at this day is about conformity, that all Churches will not be conformed to one; And yet even that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, if it were brought to paſs, would not, could not put an end to other differences; But here is ſuch a conformity that would ſoon end all quarrels whatſoever, if men would make it their ſtudy and buſineſs, to conform themſelves to the image of the Son of God: If men would ſeriouſly endeavour a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with Chriſt, by holineſs, meekneſs, patience, obedience, (vertues ſo much out of our uſe, that they are almoſt out of our knowledge, but quite out of our remembrance) they would never be Non-conformiſts in any lawful thing, nor require con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in any that is unlawful, much leſs would they brand one another as reprobates; but every one would ſtrive to make his own Election ſure, &amp; Hope well of anothers, &amp; ſo we ſhould all forth with prove unerring ſtudents &amp; unblamable proficients in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114933:66"/>
that grand controverted Doctrine of Predeſtination; if we did but truly follow the meekneſs of this Lamb.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the Paſchal Lamb was ſlain as a memorial of the Jews deliverance from the bondage of <hi>Egypt:</hi> So was Chriſts death our deliverance from the bondage of ſin and Satan: Let me then <hi>ſtand faſt in that ſpiritual liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made me free,</hi> and be no leſs afraid of returning to my former ſins, then the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were of returning to their former bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, alwaies remembring that dreadful ſentence in the Apoſtle, who in that he had fallen himſelf, was the more careful to keep others from a relapſe, <hi>the latter end is worſe with them then the beginning, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, the blood of the Paſchal Lamb ſprinkled on the door poſts, made the deſtroying Angel paſs over the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when he ſmote the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> So the blood of Chriſt ſprinkled upon our ſouls, preſerveth us from the deſtroying Angel: A mercy to be remembred with an everlaſting thankfulneſs, and to be commemorated with an everlaſting thankſgiving; for this is a part of the new ſong in heaven, <hi>Rev. 5. 9. Thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God with thy blood.</hi> What was the ground of their thankſgiving in heaven, muſt be the ground of our ſupplication on earth, that we loſe not the benefit of this blood which is the price of our Redemption: that neither through the infirmities of the fleſh, nor the anguiſhes of the Spirit, nor the backſlidings of the world, nor the temptations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, we be drawn or driven from faith in the blood of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: And accordingly we muſt take care that we be not driven or drawn from the outward profeſsion and exerciſe of this faith, leaſt we come by degrees to be driven or drawn from the inward ſettlement and aſſurance of it.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, the Paſchal Lamb was to be eaten with bitter herbs, and without leaven; ſo Chriſt is to be received with repentance, and without malice or hypocriſie; which is the moſt common, but the moſt unſavoury leaven of the ſoul; for a ſmall parcell of either of theſe will infect and corrupt all our beſt Religious performances, even as a little leaven leaventh the whole lump: Accordingly the Apoſtle is moſt induſtrious to chaſe this leaven out of our hearts, when he biddeth us to keep <hi>the feaſt, not with

old leaeven,</hi> that is, the leaven of hypocriſie, when we pretend to be new men but are not: <hi>Nor with the leaven of malice and wickedneſs, but with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth, 1 Cor. 5. 8. <gap reason="foreign">

Secret not only to others, but alſo to my ſelf: He that ſo heartily repents of the ſins he knows not, doth much more repent of thoſe he knows: And indeed the Paſchal Lamb might not be eaten without bitter herbs, nor can Chriſt be received without ſorrow and bitterneſs of Spirit, ſo as to become the nouriſhment of our ſouls; and thoſe men are groſly miſtaken, who think they can receive him by faith alone, without repentance; for who dares preach Chriſt otherwiſe then he preached himſelf? and that was by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; So ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>Jeſus began to preach and to ſay, Repent, Mat.</hi> 4. 17.

our ſelves into our Saviours mercy; nor can we truly rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his righteouſneſs by faith, till we have firſt bewailed our own unrighteouſneſs by repentance: And indeed the ſtrange faith that ſome of late have deſired and deviſed, (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deviſed becauſe they deſired it) of being in Chriſt whiles they be in malice, injuſtice, diſobedience, profaneneſs, perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and other ſuch like grievous ſins, is much like the ſtrange woman ſpoken of in the <hi>Proverbs, Her lips drop as a honey-comb, and her mouth is ſweeter then oyl, but her end is bitter as worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Porv.</hi> 5. 3, 4. for ſuch a faith begins in honey and oyl, promiſing ſalvation with much ſweetneſs and ſmoothneſs, but its end is as bitter as wormwood, for it bringeth death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon the ſoul.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly and laſtly, The Paſchal Lamb was to be eaten whole, and to be eaten only by the circumciſed; So Chriſt is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken whole, in all the Doctrines of the Chriſtian faith; That which he hath commanded is as neceſſary to ſalvation, as that which he hath promiſed; and we may not expect to inherit his promiſes, if we neglect and diſobey his commands; not a bone of his natural body was broken by the Jew; nor may a bone of his ſpiritual or of his myſtical body be broken by the Chriſtian: They brake the legs of the malefactors who were not yet dead, but they brake not the legs of Chriſt, (Saint <hi>John</hi> 19.) ſo may the Magiſtrate break the legs, and ſtop the proceedings of male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, (eſpecially if they be not yet dead to their ſins by a hearty repentance and amendment of life) but he may not break the legs of Chriſt, or cruſh any of thoſe whom Chriſt hath appointed to be the ſupporters of Chriſtianity: Again, we muſt remember, that unleſs the Jew was circumciſed, he had no right to eat of the Paſchal Lamb: So we Chriſtians may not hope to receive Chriſt, unleſs we be ſpiritually circumciſed in our ears and in our hearts; in our ears to hear his voice, in our hearts to obey it; Elſe it were poſſible for us ſo to receive God the Son, as to reſiſt God the Holy Ghoſt; for ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Stephen, Act. 7. 51. ye ſtiff-necked, and uncircumciſed in hearts and ears, ye do alwaies reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> The uncircumciſed in hearts and ears cannot be the receivers of Chriſt, becauſe they are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſters of his Spirit; becauſe they <hi>reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114933:69"/>
of the power of the Devil: the fourth is, the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the gate of heaven. O my ſoul, evermore give him hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thanks for this Paſsion, which hath purged thy ſins that did both defile and oppreſs thee; which hath ſatisfied and appeaſed thy God who was angry with thee; which hath ſtopped the Devils mouth that he cannot claim thee; which hath opened the gate of heaven, that it will receive thee. We now fully ſee the vertue of this Propitiation; we are in the next place to conſider the great goodneſs, wiſdom, juſtice, and power of God in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for us, and giving it to us; wherein we ſhall do beſt to follow his method, who firſt put the Divinity of the Greek Church into a Methodical Syſtem, and that was <hi>Damaſcene,</hi> who <hi>lib. 3. de orth. fide, c.</hi> 1. ſaith, That this giving of Chriſt to be made our Propitiation, did in one and the ſame act, ſhew the goodneſs, the wiſdom, the juſtice, and the power of God; <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap> Firſt the goodneſs of God, in that the Creator did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the infirmity of his creature, but did rather communicate therein, and take it upon himſelf; which ſhould make us ſay with great devotion, and greater thankfulneſs, <hi>O that men would therefore praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and declare the wonders that he doth for the children of men, Pſalm</hi> 107. Words of thankſgiving which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> did not think they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat too often, when he conſidered of mans temporal preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore ſure we cannot repeat them often enough, when we think of our eternal ſalvation, and of the infinite goodneſs of our Saviour in purchaſing and procuring it for us.</p>
                           <p>Secondly the wiſdom of God, That there was ſo miraculous a way found out to pay the price of our Redemption, that he who was exalted in the higheſt and could not be humbled, yet was ſo humbled to the loweſt, as not to loſe any jot of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation; <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>Thirdly, the Juſtice of God, that though man was his choiceſt workmanſhip, and after his own image, yet he would not pull him by violence from the Tyrant who had unjuſtly got Dominion over him, but paid ſuch a value for the redemption of his captive, as was indeed above all valuation; which had in effect been ſaid many years before <hi>Damaſcene</hi> by <hi>Leo</hi> the great

in one of his Chriſtmaſs Sermons, (<hi>Serm. 2. de Nativ.) hanc potiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimum conſulendi viam elegit, quà ad deſtruendum opus diaboli non virtute uteretur potentiae, ſed ratione Juſtitiae:</hi> He followed that counſel whereby he might deſtroy the Devils work, not by the ſtrength of his power, but by the reaſon of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, the power of God; for nothing could be an act of greater power, then to make God become man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> in his homily upon the 44. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 
                              <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>. It was the demonſtration of the greateſt power, that God could be in the nature of man; For not the conſtitution of heaven and earth and all things in them, above them and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, did ſo fully ſet forth the power of God, as did this condeſcention, that God was made man, ſaith the ſame Father; He looked upon it as an act of great power, That God had emptied himſelf, then that he had filled all the world.</p>

For if there needed no ſatisfaction for ſin, why was the eternal Son of God offered up as a ſacrifice for our ſins?

Sure we are that the whole creation of men and Angels are not able to ſatisfie the juſtice of God for one ſin, becauſe there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt their Satisfaction and his Juſtice; for the one is finite, the other is infinite; And as ſure we ought to be That God did not give us his Son to ſatisfie for our ſins, that we ſhould queſtion the neceſſity, much leſs that we ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the efficacy of his ſatisfaction. For all other ſacrifices were but Types of this great ſacrifice, which in <hi>the end of the world appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf, Heb. 9. 26. Judah</hi> deſired to be a bondman for <hi>Benjamin,</hi> but he was his brother; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, He could wiſh himſelf accurſed for the people of the Jews, but they were alſo his brethren and his kinſmen; But our Saviour Chriſt was contented to be made both a bondman and a Curſe for us, whiles we were yet his enemies; His bondage was our freedom; His Curſe was our bleſsing; but let not his love be our enmity; for though he came to ſave us whiles we were his enemies, yet he will not ſave us, if we continue ſo.

                           <p>And indeed our bleſſed Saviour himſelf in that he ſaith, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> doth evidently call for the comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of his ſacrifice upon the croſs, till his coming again, (for as long as he ſhall be out of ſight, He may not be out of mind; whiles he cannot be ſeen, he muſt be remembred)

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114933:73"/>
becauſe of a threefold conjunction of Chriſt, with us, in his nature, in his perſon, and in his office.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, Chriſt is ours in his nature by a real conjunction, having taken our nature upon him: and in that reſpect he is ours as we are men, and he hath beſtowed on all mankind a greater capacity of his Grace, then otherwiſe they would have had, by reaſon of their corrupt nature: for which cauſe the Evangelical Promiſes which God maketh to man in Chriſt, are univerſal, as excluding none, becauſe Chriſt hath taken the nature of all: but yet conditional, as including only thoſe who repent and believe the Goſpel: for no others make a right uſe or attain the end of Chriſts Merits and Mercies.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Chriſt is ours in his perſon by a voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, having taken our ſin upon him, as our ſurety or pledge; <hi>for he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows, Iſa.</hi> 53. 4. And in that reſpect he is ours as we are Chriſtians, and hath beſtowed on us the knowledge of his grace, though very many of us by our own infidelity and impenitency, make but a little and a bad uſe of that knowledge.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is ours in his office by a myſtical conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch as is between a King and his Subjects, both making but one myſtical body; and in that reſpect Chriſt is ours only as we are good Chriſtians, and hath beſtowed on us the communion or rather the communication of his grace, incorporating, nay more inſpiriting us, as his members, into himſelf. And this is the happieſt conjunction that we can have with Chriſt whiles we live here on earth; To be one with him in the ſame myſtical body, or in the ſame actual communion, not only external of his nature or of his perſon, as many are that are little benefited thereby, but alſo to be one with him in the ſame actual internal Communion of his grace; to the ineſtimable benefit of our ſouls, which are firſt ſanctified, and at laſt ſaved by this communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>For all the priviledges and bleſſings of his Regal, of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical, of his Sacerdotal function; of his power as King, of his inſtruction as Prophet, of his ſacrifice or interceſſion as Prieſt, are made ours by this bleſſed conjunction, according to that comfortable aſſertion of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 22, 23. All are yours, and ye are Chriſts:</hi> for the words are not ſpoken <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quutive

ſed cauſaliter,</hi> not by way of conſequence, but by way of cauſality, and accordingly import this ſenſe, <hi>All are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yours becauſe ye are Chriſts:</hi> Ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is yours, and he being All in All, in and through him, <hi>All is yours;</hi> but without him, All is nothing, and you are worſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing O then let me ſo rejoyce for his coming to me in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as much more to deſire and long for his coming to me in the ſoul: That as the Lord of all is joyned with me in one fleſh, ſo I may be joyned with him in one Spirit; that I may dwell in him, and he may dwell in me for ever: There is a mutual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being betwixt Chriſt and every good Chriſtian (ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) even as betwixt Chriſt and God: As the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father; and therefore Father and Son make but one eſſentially: So Chriſt is in the good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and the good Chriſtian is in Chriſt; and therefore Chriſt and the good Chriſtian make but one myſtically: If either the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were not in the Son, or the Son were not in the Father, they could not be perfectly one by eſſential Unity. And if either Chriſt be not in the Chriſtian, or the Chriſtian be not in Chriſt, they cannot be one by myſtical Unity: <hi>Sic igitur Anima cui ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herere Deo bonum eſt, non ante ſe exiſtimet ipſi perfecte unitam, niſi quum &amp; illum in ſe, &amp; ſe in illo manentem perſenſerit, (Bern. Serm. 71. ſuper Cant.</hi>) Therefore let not the ſoul, which is happy only through her union with Chriſt, think her ſelf perfectly united unto him, till ſhe perceive that he ſo dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and abideth in her, as that ſhe alſo dwelleth and abideth in him, and deſireth ſo to dwell and abide for ever.</p>
                           <p>O happy ſoul that is thus wedded to her Saviour by a ſpiritual marriage! for man and wife are not more nearly and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolubly joyned together by being one fleſh, then Chriſt and the Chriſtian ſoul by being one Spirit: <hi>Vere Spiritualis ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que connubii contractus eſt iſte; Parum dixi contractus, complexus eſt: Complexus plane, ubi idem velle, &amp; nolle idem, unum facit ſpiritum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then let me be joyned to him, that I may be one ſpirit with him, and that my ſpirit may be his, rather

then mine own: For mine own ſpirit will be death to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſin, but his ſpirit will be life to me becauſe of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10.) In my ſelf I can ſee nothing but ſin and death; In my Saviour I ſee both righteouſneſs and life; righteouſneſs to deliver me from ſin, and life to deliver me from death: Therefore <hi>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord; my ſoul ſhall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of ſalvation; he hath covered me with the robe of righteouſneſs, Iſa.</hi> 61. 10. A fit <hi>Epithalamium</hi> to celebrate this ſpiritual marriage betwixt Chriſt and the good Chriſtian, wherein though the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels be ready to make up the <hi>Chorus,</hi> yet the devout ſoul her ſelf alone ſings the ſong: There is joy in them, but much more in us for this marriage, becauſe we have ſuch a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beſtowed on us, as expells the fear both of a Divorce and of a Diſſolution; the firſt of which may be, the ſecond of which muſt be in all other marriages; They may be under a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce by ſin, they muſt be under a diſſolution by death: But the marriage betwixt Chriſt and the good Chriſtian, if it be once indeed truly conſummated, is under neither; for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Bridegroom of ſouls beſtows both righteouſneſs and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon all thoſe who are eſpouſed unto him: Such a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as will keep off ſin from cauſing a Divorce; <hi>He hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me with the robe of righteouſneſs:</hi> ſuch a ſalvation as will keep off death from cauſing a diſſolution in their marriage; <hi>He hath clothed me with the garments of ſalvation: Therefore I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my ſoul ſhall be joyful in my God;</hi> for neither ſhall my ſins diſturb this joy ſince, I am covered with his righteouſneſs; nor ſhall my death diminiſh, it ſince I am cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his ſalvation: To him be glory for this righteouſneſs, and for this ſalvation for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>

Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it hath been obſerved by Chriſtian Chronologers, that our bleſſed Saviour did riſe from the dead on that very ſame day of the year, on which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the children of Iſrael had (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two thouſand years before) paſſed ſafely through the red Sea; And indeed as their deliverance by <hi>Moſes</hi> from the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, was a type of our deliverance by Chriſt from our ſpiritual bondage; ſo their joy may well be in our hearts, and their Song in our mouths, only heightned by a greater meaſure of thankfulneſs and of thanksgiving, for as much as ours hath of the two been infinitely the greater deliverance.</p>

What can my ſoul ſay more? what ſhould it ſay leſs for being delivered from the pangs and horrours of the temporal and eternal death, but that the Lord is my Song, for being my ſtrength to reſcue and to redeem me; much more for being my ſalvation to receive me and to crown me?

Almoſt all Chriſtian writers ancient and modern do expound theſe three verſes of the Reſurrection; but I with the Jews do expound them otherwiſe: For if</hi> Job <hi>had here ſpoken of the reſurrection to come, doubtleſs the Hebrew doctors would not have pretermitted it in their Commentaries, ſince they alſo believed this Doctrine; but in ſix or ſeven of their Expoſitors, there is not one that expounds theſe words of the reſurrection:</hi> This reaſon is unſound in it ſelf and therefore unſatisfactory in its Proof: For the Jewiſh expoſitors labour after nothing more, then not to ſee Chriſt in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; And their Doctors knowing that the Chriſtians did believe and profeſs the Reſurrection of the dead, by vertue of Chriſts reſurrection, had rather leave the doctrine of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection out of their gloſſes, then allow it to be by vertue of our bleſſed Saviour, whom their fathers had crucified, and whom themſelves not only hated, but alſo accurſed and blaſphemed every day: Thus Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> tells us plainly that the Jews gave the Souldiers mony to ſay that our Saviours diſciples came by night and ſtole him away; And they that were ſo willing to put a lye in other mens mouths, were as willing to put the truth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114933:76"/>
out of their own Hearts; for ſo ſaith the ſame Evangeliſt, <hi>And this ſaying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day, Mat.</hi> 28. 15. Nor is it eaſie for any man to ſhew another Day wherein they firſt left off this Report.</p>
                           <p>Sure we are that when the Apoſtles <hi>preached through Jeſus the reſurrection from the dead, (Act.</hi> 4. 2.) that the <hi>Jews</hi> were greived, and with might and main oppoſed their Doctrine; and this ſpirit of contradiction continued in them throughout all that age wherein the New Teſtament was written; and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical writers do ſhew us that by its long continuance, it was rather increaſed then abated in their ſucceſſors: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be unſound and unſafe for any Chriſtian Divine to appeal to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Comments for the true ſenſe of any Text in the Old Teſtament concerning Chriſt; For although they unanimouſly maintain and juſtifie the Letter of the Scripture, (wherein they have ſhewed themſelves more thankful, if not more faithful, then many of our late Chriſtians, who would teach the tranſlations to juſtle out the Original) yet they have laboured to corrupt and deprave the meaning of it, in moſt of thoſe propheſies which they found the Chriſtian Church had applied unto our Saviour Chriſt. I ſpeak eſpecially of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Jews</hi> who are the cheifeſt Commentators we now have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Old Teſtament; for thoſe Rabbies who were before Chriſt, did interpret many Texts of the Meſſiah, which the later Rabbies have ſince wreſted to, and obſcured by another Interpretation; ſo that in truth thoſe later Rabbies whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we now have upon the Bible, have uſed what Art<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they could to obſcure the Propheſies concerning Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs be ill guides in any Doctrine that concerns the Chriſtian Faith: As for example, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 14. the place which Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> quotes to prove that Chriſt was to be conceived and born of a Virgin, yet <hi>Kimchi</hi> who is one of the cheifeſt and the beſt of the late <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Expoſitors, expounds it of the Prophets, or of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his wife, and ſaith that <gap reason="foreign">

For though the Chriſtians joy in Chriſt is not to be limited or confined to a day, yet that is no reaſon why a day ſhould not be limited and confined to that joy: Let ſpiritual joyes be eternal in themſelves, but for that very cauſe let our time be ſubſervient to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that they may likewiſe be ſo to us: For God appointing a ſet time for a ſpiritual duty, hath not thereby debaſed the duty, but exalted the time, even as our bleſſed Saviour appointing a ſet form of prayer, hath not thereby confined the ſpirit of prayer, but rather enlarged it: And the Holy-Ghoſt having given us ſo many ſet formes of prayer and praiſe in the Pſalmes and the reſt of the ible, Bhath not therefore taught the duty of prayer to be the leſs ſpiritual, but hath taught us to be the leſs carnal, that we ſhould not in pouring out our ſouls to God rely upon our own phanſies or inventions, but upon his holy dictates and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For there is the ſame reaſon both of <hi>hic</hi> and of <hi>nunc</hi> in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:114933:80"/>
matters of Divinity; the ſame reaſon of theſe words and of this time; God having conſecrated words to his ſervice as belonging to the ſubſtance of it, and having conſecrated times, places and perſons only as accidents and circumſtances belonging to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity thereof; And therefore it is ſtrange to ſee thoſe men who are moſt zealous for the ſet times and Dayes of ſerving God eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry week, to be ſo impetuous againſt the ſet forms of ſerving him, as thinking the ſet time to help devotion, but the ſet form to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; whereas it is evident that ſetting a time to the ſpirit muſt needs be a confinement of him, as well as ſetting of words: And to ſay to the Spirit of prayer, <hi>Pray now,</hi> is as great an intruſion and encrochement upon him, as to ſay to him, <hi>Pray this?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But in truth nither are confinements to Gods ſpirit, and both alike are intended for the enlargements of our ſpirits: Set times and Set words, that we pray in the greater aſſurance of faith, knowing we cannot be willworſhippers, whiles we conform our ſelves to his will whom we worſhip.</p>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114933:80"/>
of his wiſdom or of his Power, but very many of his Juſtice and of his Mercy, though not ſo many of his juſtice as of his mercy: we find but one memorial of his Iuſtice more particularly recommended to the care of his Church, and that is againſt thoſe men who had ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> and to <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> to their Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Governours, <hi>Ye take too much upon you, ſeeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them, Numb</hi> 16. 3.

                           <p>In this one caſe we have a memorable example of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and as exemplary a memorial thereof, and we have ſcarce any other ſuch as this: but we find very many exemplary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of his mercy: Scarce any ſingular bleſſing beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Iews, but there was a ſpecial feaſt appointed in the Church to propagate and to perpetuate its remembrance: Thus was the feaſt of tabernacles inſtituted, <hi>that your generations may know that I made</hi> Iſrael <hi>to dwell in bothes when I brought them out of the Land of Egypt, Levit,</hi> 23. 43.

which yet was faithfully obſerved, and the obſervation thereof looked on as a religious, not as a ſuperſtitious practiſe, by God and man. Nay yet more, we find another feaſt after this, not mentioned in the Canonical Scripture, but only in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha, the feaſt of the Dedication of the Altar, (1 <hi>Macchab.</hi> 4. 59.) and yet this feaſt was not only carefully obſerved by the Iews, but the obſervation of it was alſo approved by our Saviour himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 10. 22, 23. which is warrant more then enough both for the Church to conſtitute ſtill ſuch feſtivals to the honour of God, and for us to obſerve the Feſtivals that are ſo conſtituted: And it is alſo check more then enough to their inſolency and perverſneſs, (if they would take notice of it) who in matters of the Chriſtian Religion will pretend to be wiſer not only then Chriſts Church, but alſo then Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

                           <p>And thus have they erred about the adminiſtration of the holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> who would be accounted very ſtrict obſervers of the grand Chriſtian Feſtivals; although in truth they cannot keep a Feſtival in honour of Chriſt, who falſely adminiſter the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> no more then they who Preach falſe Doctrine, or uſe falſe devotions: For it is evident from this practice of the Apoſtles, that Chriſtian Feſtivals ought to be celebrated by preaching the word, and adminiſtring the holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and much more by holy and religious prayers, which may not be left out either in preaching of the word, or in adminiſtring of the Sacrament, unleſs we will not regard Gods bleſſing on the one, nor his preſence in the other: Nay indeed, holy and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prayers do in effect partake both of the word and of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; of the word as they are profeſſions of our faith; of the Sacrament, as they are remembrances of our Saviour.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:114933:88"/>
and therefore ſurely not the New Lords day: Whence it follows, that if this Sunday was called <hi>the New Lords Day</hi> as renewing the day of our Lords Reſurrection, this and all other Sundayes do belong unto the Lord, chiefly upon this account that they are memorials of his Reſurrection: So that though the Law of the Sabbath (as well as of other things) came by <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet the grace and truth of it came by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 17. And for this reaſon was the Sabbath tranſlated from its own day to our Lords Day, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> might give place to the grace and truth of Jeſus Chriſt; and happily for that cauſe (amongſt others) hath the Church appointed ſome annual memorials of the grace and truth which came by Jeſus Chriſt to be ſolemnized as ſo many Sabbaths, leaſt we ſhould think that in this weekly memorial ſhe did rather follow the Law given by <hi>Moſes;</hi> then the grace and truth which came by Jeſus Chriſt: And doubtleſs when we have ſaid all that we can, there can be no entire keeping of a Sabbath from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> but only from Chriſt; becauſe in him alone the ſoul may ſeek for reſt, and in him alone is ſure to find it. For as the ſouls trouble is from ſin; ſo her reſt is from the expiation and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins: Therefore as her trouble is from her ſelf, ſo her reſt is from her Saviour; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us both together in his Sermon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and our own Church in her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymn of the Reſurrection, <hi>For ſeeing that by man came death, by man alſo commeth the Reſurrection of the dead: for as by</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>all men do dye, ſo by Chriſt all men ſhall be reſtored to life: By man came death, by</hi> Adam <hi>all men do die.</hi> There's the ſouls trouble from her ſin for the wages of ſin is death: <hi>By man commeth the Reſurrection of the dead: by Chriſt all men ſhall be reſtored to life,</hi> there's the ſouls reſt or Sabbath, from her Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: for the gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. If we will needs gainſay the Judgement of our own Church, to ſet up the Sabbath inſtead of the Lords day, yet we may not gainſay the Doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which requires us to ſet up the Lords day inſtead of the Sabbath: ſo that if we will needs borrow the name from <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet we can have the thing it ſelf only from Chriſt; for it is not <hi>Moſes</hi> but Chriſt which can give the ſoul a Sabbath, or make it truly to reſt in God: And indeed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore men had need take heed of that Sabbatarian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which ſeeks to advance the day above the duty, as if the publike exerciſe of Religion had been appointed for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and not rather the Sabbath for the publick exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; for this is not in truth to alledge the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to miſtake it: For the moral or ſubſtantial and eternal part of the fourth Commandment conſiſts of theſe two particulars. 1. That there be a publike ſolemn worſhip of God, or exerciſe of Religion for our ſouls to reſt in God. And this is <hi>morale naturae,</hi> moral by the Law of Nature, that man ſhould deſire and declare his reſt to be only in God. 2. That ſome certain dayes (and conſequently other requiſites or adjuncts) be conſecrated or made holy for that publike worſhip, and in relation thereto be eſteemed holy and religious, as ſet apart to ſerve our God, not to ſerve our ſelves. And this is <hi>Morale Diſciplinae,</hi> (as ſaith <hi>Halenſis</hi>) or <hi>ex inſtituto;</hi> moral by way of Diſcipline, or by way of inſtitution, and is alſo a ſubſtantial part of the fourth Commandment, belonging not only to the <hi>Jew,</hi> but alſo to the Chriſtian.</p>

In this caſe he looked round about on the Phariſees <hi>with anger, being grieved for the hardneſs of their hearts, (Mar.</hi> 3. 5.) He imployed his tongue, his eyes, his heart, his head all to beat down this Hereſie, or rather this Hypocriſie, which under pretence of being zealous for Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, did in truth not only ſecretly undermine, but alſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe them. Accordingly our bleſſed Saviour and Maſter hath in one chapter, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 12.) fortified us with no leſs then four limitations of this or any other poſitive or Ceremonial Law, wherein it doth not bind and oblige: or at leaſt four inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations to mitigate the rigour of its obligation: The firſt is, <hi>Lex naturae</hi> or <hi>neceſſitatis: it muſt give place to the Law of nature or of neceſſity,</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Davids</hi> Hunger, <hi>ver.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.

The third is <hi>Lex cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis: it muſt give place to the Law of charity,</hi> as is proved from the ſaying of <hi>Hoſea, I will have mercy and not ſacrifice, ver.</hi> 7.

                           <p>For ceremonials are appointed for Morals; but Morals are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for themſelvs: Poſitive conſtitutions are for the inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of natural inſtitutions, but natural inſtitutions are for the God of nature. Wherefore ſince Gods worſhip is not cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial but moral, not poſitive but natural, &amp; the Sabbath is both poſitive and ceremonial, it muſt follow that the worſhip was not ordained for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for the worſhip, and conſequently the worſhip is cleerly above the Sabbath: And this ſame Antiſabbatarian doctrine, is not only of Chriſts, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>Moſes</hi> his own teaching, if we may believe the Jewiſh Doctors themſelves, upon thoſe words of <hi>Exod. 12. 16.

                           <p>In a word, a Sabbath in general is doubtleſs moral by the fourth commandment, which requires a day to be ſet apart or made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Gods publike worſhip, &amp; requires that the day ſo ſet apart, be eſteemed holy and religious, though not ſo much for its own ſake, as for its works ſake, according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Miniſters that are ſet apart for the ſame worſhip, 1. <hi>Theſ. 5. 12, 13.

labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you; And to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake:</hi> which text plainly convinceth thoſe men to be the greateſt ſabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers, and contemners of the fourth commandment, who will not know thoſe which labour among them in the Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be to contemn, and to revile and to oppreſs them; and are ſo far from acknowledging thoſe labourers to be over them in the Lord, that they ſtrive both to bring the labour under their girdles, and to tread the labourers under their feet; for the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>they are to be eſteemed highly,</hi> if not for their own, yet ſurely <hi>for their works ſake;</hi> &amp; in ſaying ſo teacheth us to ſay the ſame of the time and place that are conſecrated to the publike worſhip of God; For by the rule of proportion what is commanded concerning one adjunct of Religion, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded concerning the reſt; and we may not think we have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged our duties to the fourth commandment by honouring the time, but pillaging and defying both the Places and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are conſecrated to Gods ſervice; or to ſpeak yet more plainly, by crying up the Sabbath, but beating down both Churches and Miniſters.</p>
                           <p>And indeed the fourth commandment it ſelf hints no leſs, which deriveth the reaſon of the Sabbaths being ſanctified above other dayes, not from any holineſs in the day it ſelf, or any ſet number of dayes, but only from the holineſs that is in God: (<hi>Wherefore the Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day and hallowed it:</hi>) The Sabbath in reſpect of its duty, is without doubt of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right; in reſpect of its day, may without derogation to the fourth commandment, in the Judgement of many good Divines be ſaid to be of Eccleſiaſtical right; For the duty is matter of Religion, which God hath reſerved wholly to himſelf; the day is matter of order, which God hath in part left unto his Church, even in this very caſe; for though he hath determined a ſet day for his publike worſhip, yet he hath not confined his Church to that day (as he hath to the worſhip it ſelf) by his determination: Therefore we may not deny Gods Church that liberty which he hath given her, though we are willing to ſay he hath given it with this limitation or reſtriction, that where the Apoſtolical Church hath poſitively determined any thing in the practice of Religion, (as in the weekly feſtival for the honour of Chriſt,) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

And where the Catholick Church hath determined to the ſame purpoſe, (as in the yearly Feſtivals for the honour of Chriſt,) particular national Churches may not with ſobriety or with ſafety determine againſt it; For though neither of theſe in it ſelf is againſt the ſubſtance of Religion, yet both are againſt the order and exerciſe of it, and therefore againſt God, who is the God of order, and hath commanded the exerciſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                           <p>We conclude then, that though the Sabbath in ſpecial is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, that is to ſay, that determinate ſet day, no leſs then that Temple and that Prieſthood, yet not others inſtead of them; which having been ſince determinately pointed out, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the authority of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, have as much real holineſs in them as the other ever had, and that by virtue of the ſame Commandment, which requires as a holy a publike worſhip now as it did then, ſince the ſame God who ſaid to the Jews in the old, hath ſaid to the Chriſtian in the new Teſtament, <hi>be ye holy for I am holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 16.</p>

not about <hi>Sunday a Sabbath,</hi> as if <hi>Caeſar</hi>-like it would admit of no Superiour; but of <hi>Sunday the Sabbath,</hi> which <hi>Pompey</hi>-like, will admit of no Equal: and I anſwer, That to call <hi>Sunday the Sabbath,</hi> by way of eminency, though it were lawful, yet it is not laudable; and is therefore better omitted then practiſed: for beſides that every language in the Chriſtian world takes <hi>the Sabbath day</hi> for Saturday, ſave only our late new Engliſh, and God himſelf hath taken the ſeventh day and the Sabbath for terms convertible, and all the wit of man cannot take the firſt day for the ſeventh day, it is neither ſafe for us nor for our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival to ſeek to derive its holineſs from the Jewiſh Sabbath; not ſafe for us, becauſe it will make us Judaize, at leaſt in other mens judgements, if not in our own, which is a thing that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> if he were amongſt us, would be much afraid of for our ſakes, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 10, 11.) and therefore much more ſhould we be afraid of it for our own ſakes: Not ſafe for our feſtival, which by that means will be made rely upon a broken reed (for the broken reeds are more now in <hi>Judaea</hi> then in <hi>Egypt</hi>) and ſo be ſubject to a downfall; For the Sabbath is as alterable to the Chriſtian, as to the Jew: but the Lords day is eternal. And if we have ſuch a Sabbath as is ſubject to alteration, we muſt have ſuch a Sabbath as is ſubject to annihilation; for the one is naturally not only a fore-runner of, but alſo a preparation to the other.</p>

The reaſon of the name Sabbath depends upon the creation, of which God repented ſoon after, as ſaith <hi>Moſes, it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart, Gen.</hi> 6. 6. when as the reaſon of the name Lords day depends upon the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of which he cannot repent: For <hi>Chriſt riſing again from the dead now dieth not, death from henceforth hath no power upon him: for in that he died, he died but once to put away ſin: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God, Rom.</hi> 6. 9, 10. And as Chriſt being raiſed from the dead dieth no more, ſo neither can this Feſtival die which is conſecrated to the memory of his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:114933:93"/>
but as long as the firſt day of the week ſhall laſt, ſo long it muſt be our Lords day, and not our own: As is the mercy immortal, ſo is the duty that recordeth it; and as is the duty, ſo is the day on which it is recorded: As is the Lord himſelf, ſo is his day, as much as a day can be, <hi>the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever:</hi> The ſame in all ages and ſucceſſions of the Church; <hi>Not changeable now by the Authority of his preſent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> becauſe that hath a <hi>power for edification not for deſtruction, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 8. and in this change the Church that is now, would but pull down, what the Church, when it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the maſter-builders hands, did ſet up: <hi>Not changeable by the Authority of Angeis,</hi> for they in ſo doing would in effect preach another Goſpel, another Chriſt delivered for our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and riſen again for our Iuſtification, and ſo being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under Saint <hi>Pauls anathema, Gal.</hi> 1. 9. I dare further ſay, (and I hope it is no preſumption, ſure it is intended with reverence) <hi>not changeable by Chriſt himſelf, according to his power of excellency whereby he is head of the Church, and founder of all Chriſtian Inſtitutions;</hi> becauſe though the change be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſically poſſible, that is, in its own nature, for that all daies are alike in themſelves, as to Gods worſhip; yet it is not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally poſsible, that is, in the end and reaſon of the change, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt cannot riſe again from the dead, and conſequently, there cannot be another day, as a memorial of his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                           <p>More daies then this may be ſet apart for the honour of Chriſt, by the example and from the reaſon or end of this; for the duty is of extent large enough to employ many daies, and God having conſecrated time to his own ſervice, hath made it lawful, or rather neceſſary for the Church to do ſo too; and we find the Jews did ordain the feaſts of <hi>Purim</hi> and Dedication, without any peculiar precept from the text, and yet are juſtified for ſo doing: But this day muſt be ſet apart by the example of Chriſt himſelf, who made it his free-will-offering to God, by making on it the firſt ordination of the miniſters of his Goſpel. Other daies are authorized by vertue of this: but this day is authorized by vertue of Chriſt, who choſe it for the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ordain his Apoſtles the Teachers and Governors of his Church; and alſo to give unto them the power of ordaining
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:114933:93"/>
others: So that both the circumſtances of time and perſon, the day and the Miniſters of Gods publick worſhp, have no leſs then <hi>the chief corner ſtone</hi> for their foundation: For they both are grounded upon the practiſe of Chriſt on the day of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, though builded upon the practiſe and precepts of his Apoſtles. So we read, <hi>John 20. 19. The ſame day at evening, being the firſt day of the week, came Jeſus and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaith unto them, Peace be unto you; the ſame day at evening;</hi> the evening follows the morning in the Chriſtian, but went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it in the Iewiſh account of daies. The evening and the morning made the firſt Sabbath, but the morning and the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning made the firſt Lords day; what other reaſon can we give of the change, but becauſe the Lord roſe from death in the morning, <hi>Being the firſt day of the week?</hi> Why is the firſt day of the week ſo punctually named? Surely not to tell the Apoſtles what day it was, but to tell us that ſhould be after them, that we might know the very day on which Chriſt had purchaſed for, and beſtowed on his Church ſuch unvaluable mercies, and ſo know it as to keep it, as it followeth, <hi>ver. 21. Theu ſaid Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus unto them again, Peace be unto you;</hi> Now it is more then an ordinary ſalutation, it is certainly a moſt ſolemn benediction: <hi>Peace be unto you; as my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you and when he had ſaid this, he breathed on them, and ſaith unto them, receive ye the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> We have here the practiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt, for ſolemnizing the day of his reſurrection, and for the ordaining of his Miniſters: We have his example for the obſervation of the Lords day, which as he made holy by his own riſing, ſo he kept holy by his bleſsing, and ordaining the Apoſtles on it: And we have his example for the ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords Miniſters: and there is little reaſon why we ſhould eaſily, and much leſs ſlightly, paſs by the former, ſince we are ſure that the latter is to continue till the worlds end; for this is the full meaning of the words, <hi>As my Father ſent me, and endued me with the Holy Ghoſt, or with ſpiritual authority to be the teacher and governor of his univerſal Church: So I ſend you, and endue you with the Holy Ghoſt, or with ſpiritual authority and power, to be teachers and governors of the Church after me: And as the Father ſent me with power and authority of ſending others, and of giving them the Holy Ghoſt, or my ſpiritual power: So do
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:114933:94"/>
I ſend you with the power of ſending others, and giving unto them the Holy Ghoſt, or this ſpiritual authority and power of ſending others ſtill after them, even to the worlds end.</hi> This is the full meaning of thoſe words, and therefore the antient Fathers, (particularly Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Firmilian</hi>) did rightly apply this Text to prove by it the authority of the Church in their daies, and we may as rightly alledge it now to juſtifie the ſame authority: For the Biſhops are obliged by this Text to ordain a ſucceſſion of Miniſters even to the worlds end, <hi>One muſt be ordained to be a witneſs with us of his reſurrection,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 1. 22. If God ſay, <hi>One muſt be ordained,</hi> it is not for boiſterous men to ſay, ye ſhall nor ordain; nor for timerous men to ſay, we dare not: They that are enemies to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the witneſſes, can ſcare be friends to the Doctrine of the reſurrection. The Lords daies and the Lords Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will ſtand or fall both together; and there is no oppoſing the one, without oppoſing the other; and no oppoſing either, without oppoſing Gods command. For indeed they are both alike in general commanded by the fourth Commandment, though only one be named, (even as uncleanneſs and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are both forbidden in the ſeventh, though only adultery be mentioned) and they are both alike in ſpecial determined by the example of Chriſt and of his Apoſtles, and the conſtant and univerſal practiſe of the Chriſtian Church: As there is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Holy Ghoſt that concerns the time or the day proved from the firſt of the <hi>Corinthians 16 2. As I have given order to the Churches of Galatia, even ſo do ye:</hi> that is, the ſame order that I gave to them concerning the firſt day of the week, I give alſo to you, and in you to all other Churches; (which order was accordingly ſpeedily and generally obeyed, becauſe there was an irreſiſtible reaſon for that obedience;) ſo alſo there is an order from the Holy Ghoſt concerning the perſons, proved from <hi>Acts 20. 8. The Holy Ghoſt hath made you Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers or Biſhips;</hi> and <hi>Titus 1. 5. That thou ſhouldſt ordain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Presbyters;</hi> whence it muſt needs follow, that to diſturb the perſons ordained to be in the Church of God is equally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious, as to diſturb the day that was ſettled by the ſame order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the determination of the perſons appointed to be the Lords Miniſters, is full as plain (to ſpeak but ſparingly) both
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:114933:94"/>
in the preſcript of the Text, and in the practice of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, as is the determination of the Lords day; and thoſe men are equally inexcuſable, who make bold to alter Gods determination in the one, as thoſe who make bold to alter it in the other; for both being eſtabliſhed by the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are alike unalterable.</p>
                           <p>An univerſal obligation bindeth equally all perſons, at all times, and in all places; and therefore only moral and eternal duties of the Text, can immediately and from themſelves have ſuch an obligation, as the duties of faith, hope and charity: But yet a determination of the Text, though by way of example only, concerning the publick exerciſe of thoſe duties, which is without controverſie in the Goſpel of Chriſt given to us Chriſtians, may alſo immediately and by vertue of the ſaid du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, have an univerſal obligation; becauſe to occaſion the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance or diſeſteem of the true and laudable exerciſe of Religion, whether by profaneſs or perverſneſs, whether by throwing aſide or pulling down the time, place or perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that purpoſe, is certainly ungodly and irreligious, and it is at no time lawful to do an act of ungodlineſs or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

This great Sacriledge is yet further accompanied with one of the ſeven deadly ſins (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo called) and that ſin is ſpiritual ſlothfulneſs: So ſaith <hi>Alenſis, Accidia opponitur praecepto de ſanctificatione Sabbathi; In peccato enim Accidiae, Triſtitia eſt de ſpirituali laborioſo, cum amore quietis carnalis; è contra vero, in illo praecepto eſt Amor ſanctae quietis, quae eſt cum gaudio in bono ſpirituali; (par. 2 qu. 140. m.</hi> 10.)

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not limit or reſtrain the end of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment by the letter of it, advancing the day above the duty; for that is the way not to pray in faith that we may keep this Law; much leſs may we limit and reſtrain the firſt Commandment by the fourth; for that is the way not to be able to pray in faith, that we may keep any other Law, ſince it is evident that the love of God is the foundation of faith in all our prayers, and that Love is required in the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that to reſtrain that Commandment is to reſtrain our love of God; and to reſtrain our love of God, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain our faith in God: Again, we may not limit the firſt Commandment by the fourth; for that were to limit the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the leſſer; and tis evident, the fourth was given to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the exerciſe of the firſt, not to enfeeble its obligation; ſince then the firſt commands us to love God with all our hearts and with all our ſouls, we may not think that the fourth was given to confine this love in any one particular member of Chriſt, much leſs in his whole myſtical body, as if Chriſtians were bound to make uſe of their hearts and ſouls in the publike exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and profeſſion of their love to God only upon Sunday, or upon one day in ſeven.</p>
                           <p>Accordingly we muſt account every Chriſtian Feſtival that is truly in honour and for love of Chriſt. (and particularly this of the Paſſover) <hi>An high day;</hi> and to ſhew that we account it ſo, our beſt way is to endeavour to make it ſo, by making it a day of obſervations. Now obſervations cannot be leſs then two; and that two may indeed ſerve our turns one of theſe obſervations muſt be of our ſelves, another of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: The obſervation of our ſelves muſt be three-fold, <hi>what

they have not known what belongs to an innocent and a peaceable life; and indeed how can they know what belongs to peace, who will not know what belongs to innocency?

whether he will pray for us, if we will not pray for our ſelves; Whether his offering himſelf to God will be available to our ſalvation, unleſs we alſo offer our ſelves unto him; for ſo the Apoſtle ſeems to intimate, <hi>Heb. 7. 25. Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> For whom? For them doubtleſs that came unto God by him; but ſcarce for others who either come not to God at all, or come not to God by him, but by ſome other Mediator: Tis a dangerous matter not to look on Chriſt in his paſſion; and as dangerous not to look immediately on him in his interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: The firſt ſhews us what he was in his humiliation; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, what he is in his exaltation; and yet the eye of faith will ſtill look further after him, not only as a Saviour, and as a Mediator, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo as a Judge: for that's the third obſervation concerning Chriſt, <hi>what he will be in his retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution:</hi> Not a ſevere but a merciful Judge, to judge us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel, which will condemn only the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and unbelieving ſinners; not according to the Law which will condemn even the moſt righteous.</p>
                           <p>A merciful Judge to acquit us by the Merits and righteouſneſs of that blood which he himſelf hath ſhed for us; according to that moſt comfortable Prayer in the heavenly Hymn of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> (which alone was of merit enough to entitle the <hi>Ambroſian</hi> office, ſo long to keep its ſtation againſt the <hi>Gregorian) We believe that thou ſhalt come to be our Judge; we therefore pray thee help thy ſervants when thou haſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with thy precious blood:</hi> We are ſure thou wilt not loſe thine own blood, and that makes us hope thou wilt not loſe us, for whom thou haſt been pleaſed to ſhed it.</p>

duty of publick thankſgiving: That thou haſt vouchſafed us this great honour, who are duſt and aſhes, and greater mercy, who are ſinful duſt and aſhes, to bleſs and praiſe thee and to call upon thy holy name. And they have this reward of their thankfulneſs, that in the middſt of the greateſt and bittereſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>they do ſtill enjoy their Liturgy,</hi> groaning indeed under the bondage and oppreſſion of their bodies, but infinitely rejoycing in the liberty of their ſouls: the Turks themſelves thinking it too inhumane a tyrannie to bring that people into bondage both of body and of ſoul: And as for the Jews, they would have laughed at any man that ſhould have offered them whimſies inſtead of certainties, and would ſooner have let their bread be taken out of their mouthes, then this their hymn of bleſsing and praiſing God; So great, ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, ſo conſtant was their zeal, for that which they knew to be true godlineſs.</p>
                           <p>This, I ſay, was the general thankſgiving of the Iews at all their great Feaſts, to the which they added thoſe particular forms of thankſgiving, that moſt properly concerned the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                           <p>And this was their ſpiritual manner of feaſting, God himſelf ſuggeſting no leſs, in that he commanded them to take their Lamb the tenth day of the moneth, which was not to be ſlain till the fourteenth; for why was the Lamb to be taken ſo long before hand, but only that their ſouls might feed on the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, before their bodies feaſted on the Lamb? And the Jewiſh Authors tell us, that during thoſe four daies, the Lamb was tyed to their bed-poſts, that not only eating and drinking (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> requires of us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 31.) but alſo ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waking, they might glorifie their God. And ſo will we too, if we have the true love and zeal of godlineſs, ſaying with thoſe three holy men, for the ſame cauſe that they did, even our deliverance from the fiery furnace, not of temporary but of everlaſting burnings, <hi>O ye ſervant of the Lord, bleſs ye the Lord, praiſe him and magnifie him for ever: O ye ſpirits and ſouls of the righteous, bleſs ye the Lord, praiſe him and magnifie him for ever: O ye holy and humble men of heart, bleſs ye the Lord, praiſe him and magnifie him for ever.</hi> So that unleſs we will profeſs that we ſerve our ſelves, not our God, that we are men whoſe ſpirits and

                           <p>This is the zeal we ſhould bring with us to this and all other our Chriſtian Feſtivals, as the Prophet requireth, ſaying, <hi>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and ſhalt honour him, not doing thine own waies, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words, Iſa.</hi> 58. 13. which text (in <hi>Kimchies</hi> gloſs) is to be interpreted of the Sabbath in general, for (ſaith he) the feaſt of expiation was ſtrictly to be obſerved as a Sabbath, though it was placed on the 10. day of <hi>September</hi> (which might fall on any day of the week.)

And it is much to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that after <hi>Saul</hi> knew God had rejected him for his diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, he deſired to worſhip him only in ſhew, not in reality, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114933:105"/>
to draw us to him: And accordingly <hi>Saul</hi> being in the ſtate of ſin, profeſſeth in effect that he was deſirous to keep at a diſtance from God, ſaying unto <hi>Samuel, Turn again with me that I may worſhip the Lord thy God:</hi> He durſt not ſay, the Lord my God: for he had too much provoked him by his ſin, and too little ſought to be reconciled to him by repentance, to claim any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in his mercy: Sin wilfully committed <hi>drives</hi> a man from God; ſin careleſly unrepented, <hi>keeps</hi> a man from him; ſo that whiles the man is in ſin, whether it be willfully, or careleſly, he cannot come near God, but is either driven or at leaſt kept from him; yea let him come never ſo near to God, yet by his ſin he is ſure to be kept far from him; for he ſo draweth near him with his lips, as to be far from him with his heart; It is not to be doubted but <hi>David</hi> made many a fair ſhew of worſhipping God during that year that he continued in the guiltineſs of his murder and of his adultery: And yet it is not to be thought, much leſs believed, that during that guiltineſs he was a true worſhipper; for it is plain from his own mouth that ſin had ſhut up his lips becauſe he prayed God to open them: and as plain, that ſin ſhutteth not up the lips, but where it hath firſt ſhut up the heart, ſince the heart is the firſt mover in the order of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and conſequently the firſt ſtander-ſtill in the neglect of that order.</p>
                           <p>No wonder then if the Text ſaith, <hi>God heareth not ſinners, (John</hi> 9. 31.) for how can he hear thoſe that do not ſpeak? or if they do ſpeak, yet they do not pray, becauſe they have only <hi>Verbum oris, non verbum mentis,</hi> becauſe they ſpeak only with their lips, not with their hearts: God is not as man to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached unto by outward addreſſes and applications; if the tongue move without the heart, the man ſits ſtill, and doth not at all draw near, in Gods account, whatever he may do in his own: Therefore the Apoſtle aſcribeth it to one and the ſame faith that we pleaſe God, and that we come unto him: <hi>Heb. 11. 6. Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; for he that cometh to God muſt believe:</hi> The words will afford this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm; He that doth come to God, doth alone pleaſe God; he that hath not faith doth not come unto God: Therefore he that hath not faith, doth not or cannot pleaſe God: And this Syllogiſm will afford us this Doctrine, That we muſt come to God if we
<pb facs="tcp:114933:105"/>
will pleaſe him, and muſt have faith if he will come unto him: <hi>For he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him:</hi> That he is God, the fountain of all goodneſs; and that they who thirſt after, ſhall drink deep of this fountain: Nay yet more, as the words are alledged to prove <hi>Enoch</hi> had faith, they muſt have this expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>He that cometh to God, muſt believe that God is his God,</hi> and that he will be his rewarder, if he diligently ſeek him; for ſo did <hi>Enoch</hi> believe, when he did forſake, and by forſaking did provoke the men of that wicked age of the world, (foul enough for a flood to waſh it, though no waſhing could cleanſe it) only that he might walk with God: His Faith ſtrengthened him againſt his fears, whiles it repreſented God thus ſpeaking unto him, <hi>Fear not, I am thy ſhield and thy exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Gen.</hi> 15. 1. Wherefore though <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake not one word of <hi>Enochs</hi> faith, yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> takes it for as good a proof that <hi>Enoch</hi> had faith, becauſe he pleaſed God; as that he pleaſed God, becauſe God took him.</p>
                           <p>And is it poſſible that this faith ſhould be in any man who is yet in his ſins? No certainly; for he cannot believe God to be his ſhield, whom he hath made his enemy; nor to be his reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whom he hath made his avenger: Look upon your firſt Father <hi>Adam</hi> after he had ſinned, and you will ſee your ſelf in him, and your ſin his: God called unto him, and ſaid, <hi>Where art thou?</hi> but he ſaid, <hi>I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, becauſe I was naked, and I hid my ſelf, (Gen.</hi> 3. 10.) A ſtrange folly that made him think he could hide himſelf from Gods All-ſeeing eye; A ſtranger fear that made him deſire to hide himſelf from Gods All-ſaving Preſence; He knew that in God alone he lived, and moved, and had his being, and yet was afraid of him, when he was yet ſcarce fully entred into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his life: The reaſon was, he had taken ſuch an inmate into his ſoul as he knew God could not but hate, and could not but confound and deſtroy. Whiles he continued in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, nothing that God ſaid could fright him; nothing that God did, could hurt him: But when once he had ſinned, Gods voice that only called for his appearance, was more terrible then his hand before that had taken away his rib; a ſtill ſmall voice in the cool of the day makes him flie into a thicket, as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114933:106"/>
thinking thereby to ſecure himſelf. In this miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he would have lived and dyed; (for the ſame cauſe muſt have produced ſtill the ſame effect,) had not God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him <hi>that the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head,</hi> and in that promiſe revealed Chriſt unto him as a propitiation for his ſins; After that, though he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thruſt out of Paradiſe, yet he could think of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into Gods preſence with ſacrifice and burnt offerings, (for ſure twas he taught his ſons thoſe offices of Religion,) becauſe he ſaw he had a Mediator to intercede for him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before that promiſe, though he was actually in the Garden of God, yet he durſt not come neer him, as not knowing how to intercede for himſelf: For his ſin had caſt ſuch a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch an amazement upon his ſoul, that he durſt not open his eyes to look on God, and could not open his mouth to make ſupplication to him, becauſe he knew he was firſt to make ſatisfaction, before he could be admitted to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; for that Gods offended juſtice was to be ſatisfied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his undeſerved mercy might be implored: And ſo is it with all mankind ever ſince, being all conceived and born in ſin, we cannot but come into the world with a natural aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God, that is, with a fear to come neer him, and with a deſire to go and keep far from him, if it were poſſible, alwayes out of his ſight. And as we come into the world, ſo we abide in it with a total averſion from God, till he be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to reveal his Son to us</hi> that we may know him, or rather <hi>in us</hi> that we may love him: Nor would any man that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the corrupt loins of <hi>Adam,</hi> ever have thought, much leſs have deſired to come neer God to worſhip him, had there not been revealed a ſufficient atonement for his ſin; For till our ſins be expiated, we cannot hope that our worſhip ſhould be accepted: And as for the heathens and <hi>Jews</hi> who worſhip God without the knowledge or with the contempt of Chriſt, we muſt ſay their worſhip is not good, and is rather out of a good cuſtome, then out of a good conſcience, (as too many Chriſtians ſtill worſhip God, who know not Chriſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually or practically) And tis better ſaying ſo, then to ſay they can have either a good conſcience or a good worſhip, who have not faith in Chriſt.</p>

Nor is it lawfull, and much leſs laudable in any man, to account thoſe men Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who doubt the divinity of Chriſt: much leſs, who deny it: For they that have not Chriſt for their God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot have the true God for their God: And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> takes theſe two for one and the ſame miſchief, <hi>to be without Chriſt and to be without God:</hi> ſaying to the <hi>Epheſians, At that time ye were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, being Aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenants of promiſe, having no hope and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world, Eph.</hi> 2. 12. Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> in his Catechiſm expound theſe words of the Heathen, ſaying thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>: Some of them made the Sun their God, that all the night long they might be without God; others made the Moon their God, that they might be without God all the day: But in truth the words will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern many men that are far from that ſtupid and groſs Idolatry, even all Jews and all Turks, and too too many that are called Chriſtians, even as many as queſtion the divinity of Chriſt for all theſe alike are <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, All Atheiſts alike as being without the true God: And if their Religion make them Atheiſts, what ſhall we call it but Irreligion or Atheiſm?</p>
                           <p>But I will not inſiſt any longer upon the proofs of the Text to juſtifie the Chriſtian Religion, ſince even common ſenſe it ſelf doth make known this Tenent, and common experience doth make it good: For it is a very ſubſtantial and ſufficient proof, that no other Religion hath in it thoſe truths which are really conformable to a rational mans underſtanding, but only the Chriſtian; for that no other Religion ſubſiſteth any longer then the ſword that forceth it: whereas the Chriſtian Religion ſtill abideth and continueth in the world, not by the violence but by the patience of thoſe that uphold and maintain the ſame, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many and great difficulties that are <hi>in</hi> and <hi>with it,</hi> and the many and great oppoſitions and perſecutions that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:114933:107"/>
have been and are <hi>againſt</hi> it: which muſt needs argue an inward conſonancy or congruity of the Chriſtian Religion with the very ſoul of man, as alone having truths able to ſatisfie it, and alone ſhewing means able to ſave it.</p>
                           <p>And indeed theſe three excellencies (among many other,) do give to the Chriſtian Religion the preheminence above all other Religions.</p>
                           <p>The firſt is, <hi>That no other Religion declareth au expiation for ſin:</hi> The Jewiſh Religion it ſelf being defective in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, (but as it was Chriſtian and looked unto Chriſt,) the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle plainly and poſitively aſſuring us, <hi>That it is not poſsible the blood of bulls and of goats ſhould take away ſins, Heb.</hi> 10. 5. So that no Jew could have this opinion of his own Religion, that it taught a way of expiating ſin, unleſs he would be <hi>mad,</hi> that he might be thought <hi>religious;</hi> for there is no room for any the leaſt probability againſt an abſolute impoſſibility; but the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>it is not poſsible.</hi> And yet there can be no comfortable nor cordial practice of Religion to a man that groaneth under the burden of his ſins, unleſs he have this perſwaſion that his ſins may be expiated, and his perſon accepted, ſince it is impoſſible that any man ſhould care to worſhip or ſerve God being offended with him, if he had no hope to appeaſe him; Let this then be the peculiar excellency of the Chriſtian Religion, that it may be moſt comfortably and moſt cordially practiſed, becauſe it moſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that God may be appeaſed: nay indeed it teacheth how he is appeaſed, even by the merits and mediation of his ſon, who is both founder and the foundation of our Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                           <p>The Second excellency is, <hi>That no other religion propoſeth, much leſs promiſeth, ſo great and glorious a reward to thoſe that embrace it, as is the eternal and everlaſting glory both of the body and ſoul;</hi> for to let paſs the diſputes of the Heathen in this kind, which were all either vanities or uncertainties, even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf in the inſtitution of the Jewiſh Religion, if we look upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and explicite Covenants of the law, went no farther then a a land flowing with milk and honey, and a long and proſperous continuance of them and their ſeed in that land; But for what concerns a better life after this, tis either darkly included in this promiſe, or rationally concluded from it, not without ſtrong collections of a ſearching Judgement, ſuch as was that of our
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:114933:108"/>
bleſſed Saviour; <hi>Now that the dead are raiſed, even</hi> Moſes <hi>ſhewed at the buſh, when he calleth the Lord the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob; <hi>for he is not a God of the dead, but of the living, Luke</hi> 20. 37, 38. Where the concluſion was virtually in the premiſes, though not found out, till the eternal wiſdom of God diſcovered it: and ſince that diſcovery, we ſee tis undeniable in our own humane reaſon: yet if the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Doctors could have ſeen ſo much before, tis ſcarce imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that one of their chiefeſt Sects or Parties (I mean the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces) would have denied the reſurrection: Let this then be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peculiar excellency of the Chriſtian Religion, that it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>the body ſhall live again with the ſoul in the life everlaſting:</hi> for this doctrine muſt needs terrifie us from the ſins of the fleſh, becauſe we ſhall all riſe again with our own bodies, and give account of the works done in them, and be acquitted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned according to that account: And this ſame doctrine muſt alſo needs comfort and ſtrengthen us againſt all the maladies and miſeries of the fleſh; for what is a momentary ſickneſs or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, to an endleſs and everlaſting glory? Wherefore ſince it is the work of Religion to ſubdue the fleſh to the ſpirit, both in its doings and in its ſufferings, and thereby to ſubdue the ſpirit to God; and ſince the Chriſtian Religion alone can do this work, ſubduing the fleſh to the ſpirit in its doings, by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying it from ſin; and in its ſufferings, by ſtrengthning it againſt miſeries, I will evermore bleſs my God for calling me to ſuch a Religion, which maugre all the miſchief and malice both of men and devils, will neither let me be impenitently ſinfull, nor uncomfortably miſerable.</p>
                           <p>The third excellency of the Chriſtian Religion above all other religions conſiſts in that admirable holineſs and Purity which it requires in the worſhip of Chriſt, and in all other duties and works of Chriſtianity; whereas the Pagan ſacrifices were full of cruelty, delighting in the blood of men, and their myſteries full of obſcoenity invading the modeſty of women; And the Jewiſh Religion, though it had nothing unlawfull or immodeſt, yet it had many things in themſelves unuſefull and unneceſſary (though both uſeful and neceſſary in regard of the Jews, to keep them in obedience and from idolatry;) as circumciſion, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of beaſts, the diſtinction of meats, and the rigorous
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114933:108"/>
obſervation of the Sabbath: But the Chriſtian Religion requires nothing of us, ſave what is uſefull and neceſſary in it ſelf, though it were not commanded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it requires us not to circumciſe the foresking <hi>of our fleſh</hi> but <hi>of our hearts;</hi> not to keep a Sabbath by the external reſt of the body ceaſing from motion, but by the internal reſt of the ſoul, ceaſing from ſin; and taking its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in God; Not to offer the blood of bullocks, but to be ready to offer our own blood for Gods glory: not to abſtain from certain kinds of meats, but to uſe them all with ſobriety, for the chaſtiſement of the body, and ſometimes to uſe none at all, for the advantage of the ſoul; And whereas other Religions have too much of Mammon in them to teach men to forſake their eſtates, ours teacheth us to forſake our ſelves: nor if I had the tongue of men and Angels, were I able to expreſs the incomparable purity of that faith whereby we are taught to hope in God, not only above hope, but alſo againſt it: in the midſt of death to hope for life, in the extremity of Juſtice to hope for mercy: and ſo wholly to truſt God with our ſouls, as not to hope for ſalvation but only to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him thereby, deſiring his glory equally with our own eternal bliſs, or rather above it. Nor if I had a Seraphins quill, were I able to delineate the purity of that worſhip, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to pray for nothing but in relation to the honour, and with ſubordination to the will of God: and to reſt ſecure in the deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of temporal bleſſings, whiles we rely upon the promiſes of thoſe which are eternal.</p>
                           <p>This being ſuch a purity as is above our Praiſe, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to come under our Practice, plainly ſheweth that our Religion is too much above our ſelves, either to proceed from our own underſtanding, or to depend upon our own wills: and conſequently that God alone was the firſt founder, and is ſtill the Maſter-builder and defender of it.</p>
                           <p>Nor doth our Chriſtian Religion teach us this admirable puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and holineſs only in converſing with our God, but alſo in converſing with our ſelves: not only in our duty towards God, but alſo in our duty towards our neighbour; Do but conſider the ordinary offices of humanity, and the Chriſtian Religion will ſhew you there is ſome thing of Divinity in thoſe offices: for that teacheth you to relieve your brother not only as a member
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:114933:109"/>
of your own body, having the ſame fleſh and blood with your ſelf, which is according to the office of humanity, but alſo to relieve him as a member of your Saviours body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a member of God the Son, as a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> temple of God the Holy-Ghoſt, which adds ſomething of divinity to that office: <hi>Humanitas quàm ſit proprium hominis, ipſum nomen indicat;</hi> ſhew the offices of Humanity to another man for your own ſake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are a man, unleſs you would be accounted a beaſt, was a forcible argument for men to be curteous and friendly one to another, before Chriſt came in the fleſh: But now that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be ſtrained to a higher pitch, and we muſt ſay, ſhew the offices of humanity to another man for the Son of Gods ſake becauſe you are a Chriſtian, unleſs you would be accounted not a beaſt, but a devil.</p>
                           <p>So undeniable is the argument of the Chriſtian Religion for the practiſe of Charity: So inexcuſable are Chriſtians above other men for the practice of uncharitableneſs: For ſurely we cannot deny but this doctrine of doing good to all, and hurt to none for Chriſts ſake, is nowhere to be found but among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, though their practiſe in this yron age of the hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world hath much diſagreed from this doctrine: As for the Turks religion, it was born in the camp, ſmells of the camp, lives by the camp; it was brought in by the ſword, ſavours of the ſword, is preſerved and propagated by the Sword: And yet in this reſpect, (ſhame it is to ſay it, but the ſhame is theirs of whom it may be truly ſaid,) many Chriſtians are of late turned Turks: So that the black-mouthed calumnie of <hi>Calvino-Turciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> is in this ſenſe a Truth, and the retaliation of that by <hi>Papiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo-Turciſmus,</hi> is in this ſenſe not to be thought a calumnie; for both Proteſtants and Papiſts as much as they have of cutting of purſes and cutting of throats in their late inhumane rapines and butcheries, ſo much they have of Turciſm, not of Chriſtianity: For that hath ſaid, <hi>If thine enemy hunger, feed him, if he thirſt, give him drink, Rom.</hi> 12. 20. That is, ſtrive to make thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my thy friend by overcoming evil with good, but in no caſe to make thy friend (and much leſs thy God) thine enemy by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming good with evil. And indeed this mild voice is only the voice of the Chriſtian religion: For even the Jew who came neereſt to God and his goodneſs, did nevertheleſs ſay, <hi>An eye
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:114933:109"/>
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; and thou ſhalt love thy neighbour, but hate thine enemy;</hi> Tis only the Chriſtians hath learned this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the mouth of their maſter, <hi>Love your enemies, bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>ſs them that curſe you, and do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you, that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven, Mat.</hi> 5. 42. As much then as love is above hatred, bleſſing above curſing, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving above reviling, relieving above revenging, and praying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove perſecuting, or in one word, heaven above hell, ſo much is the Chriſtians Religion above all other religions in the offices of humanity, or in the converſation of man with man.</p>
                           <p>Again, look upon the converſation of man with woman, and you ſhall find the Chriſtian is taught, and the good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doth practice a greater chaſtity in his marriage, then other men look after in their virginity. He knows he is bound to <hi>poſſeſs his veſſel in ſanctification and honour; not in the luſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, even as the Gentiles which know not God, 1 Theſ.</hi> 4. 1. and therefore will take heed of making his remedy his diſeaſe, of adding oyle to the fire, of provoking that luſt of concupiſcence, which he ſhould baniſh and expel; for what he retains of luſt, that he loſes of ſanctification and honour in his body, and of the knowledge of God in his ſoul: This chaſt conſideration being grounded in the hearts of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, will either keep them innocent or make them penitent; whereas other men that know not this Doctrine, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it not, do let looſe the rains of their concupiſcence, and are further from chaſtity in their virginity, then theſe men are in their marriage: For the one follow the Apoſtles advice, <hi>It remaineth that they who have wives be as though they had none, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 29. The other follow their own unbrideled diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which makes them that have no wives, to be as though they had them; And ſurely of the two, theſe are the further from chaſtity: The Heathen did glory of rapes and adulteries in their Gods, and therefore could not eaſily be aſhamed of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and adulteries in themſelves; And the <hi>Jew</hi> though he was tyed from fornication and adultery, yet whiles he practiced his polygamy, he did in effect commit fornication with his ſecond wife; and whiles he exerciſed his divorce, he did in effect invite others to commit adultery with his firſt wife: For
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:114933:110"/>
the beſt that we can ſay in this caſe of Polygamy, is, that the text which forbad it, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 24.) was not ſo fitly explained to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as it hath been ſince to the Chriſtians; and ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> were excuſable becauſe of their ignorance: For the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> did leave them ſome liberty of thinking a man might be one fleſh with as many women as he made his wives; for there it is only ſaid, <hi>and they ſhall be one fleſh:</hi> But our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt hath plainly ſhewed us that thoſe words are in truth to be confined to two perſons, one man and one woman, by ſaying; And they twain ſhall be one fleſh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 5. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears to us Chriſtians that <hi>Polygamy</hi> was a ſin from the beginning, for it was againſt the law; but in the <hi>Jews,</hi> it was a ſin of ignorance, and by that means not without excuſe; for not being able to prove that God gave them a diſpenſation to make more wives we muſt either ſay their ignorance excuſed them, or their conſcience condemned them; but tis not ſafe to ſay their concience condemned them, ſince no man can be ſaved that ſins againſt his conſcience, and doth not repent him of his ſin, whereas without doubt the Patriarchs and King <hi>David</hi> were ſaved, though we find not they repented for having been Polygamiſts.</p>
                           <p>However it is clearly evident that the Chriſtian Religion teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a far more chaſte, modeſt and innocent converſation of man with woman, then did that of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and what can we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more in that converſation, then chaſtity, modeſty, and innocency? And yet Saint <hi>Peter</hi> doth moreover add piety, bidding the husband and wife to dwel together, that their prayers be not hindred, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. Others may look only after pleaſure, or profit; but Saint <hi>Peter</hi> bids all Chriſtians look after prayer and piety in their marriages.</p>

                              <hi>SECT. III.</hi> The reaſon why God cannot be rightly adored but only by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, is becauſe he cannot be truly known and loved but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thoſe who know and love him in Chriſt; the true way to gain that knowledge, and to ſhew and keep that love, is univerſal obedience both to his affirmative and to his nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive precepts, without which there can be no ſaving knowledge of God: That the Chriſtians do know and worſhip God in Chriſt cleerly and ſubſtantially; and that the Jews did ſo know and worſhip him in types and figures; ſo that the Jewiſh and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, differ not in ſubſtance, but only in degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</head>
                           <p>GOD cannot be rightly worſhipped by thoſe, by whom he is not truly known nor loved; and he cannot be truly known or loved by thoſe who know and love him not in Chriſt; <hi>For he is the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon, Heb. 1. 3. The brightneſs of his glory,</hi> ſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love God but for his brightneſs; and <hi>the expreſs image of perſon,</hi> ſo that we cannot know God but by this image: which being a Doctrine that contains ſomething of ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in regard of the ſeveral ſtates of men, ſome having been trained up as <hi>Jews,</hi> others as Chriſtians in the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and love of God, though it contain nothing of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in regard of it ſelf, yet will not unfitly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by way of Catechiſm, and that in theſe three que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
                           <p>1. Whether a man can love God ſave only in Chriſt? I anſwer he cannot, with an elective or deliberative love <hi>as a man,</hi> though he may with a natural love <hi>as a creature;</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe having defiled and corrupted both his nature and his perſon by his ſin, he hath loſt the innocency and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his being, though he cannot loſe the obligation of it; And conſequently if he look upon God without Chriſt, he cannot look upon him as a merciful Father that will relieve
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:114933:111"/>
his infirmities and forgive his infirmities, but only as an angry Judge, that will paſs againſt him the ſentence, and will bring upon him the vengeance of eternal condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                           <p>2. Whether a man can love God in Chriſt, till Chriſt be revealed or manifeſted to his ſoul? I anſwer again, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido;</hi> As a man cannot deſire, ſo neither can he love what he doth not know; and he doth not know God in Chriſt, to whoſe ſoul Chriſt is not yet manifeſted or revealed: So that in this caſe, moſt true is that common Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome of the Law, <hi>idem eſt non eſſe &amp; non apparere; It is all one for a thing not to be and not to appear:</hi> All one to me if I know not God in Chriſt, as if he were not at all to be known in him: For which cauſe it is worth our enquiry how it comes to paſs that ſo many who are called Chriſtians, (and who perchance think and call themſelves the beſt Chriſtians,) yet do not truly know God in Chriſt: and I muſt ſay, tis becauſe they deſire to receive Chriſt only according to the promiſes, and not alſo according to the precepts of the Goſpel, or only for the ſpeculation and knowledge, not for the practice and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith; ſo that indeed they do not deſire truly to know Chriſt; and therefore he is not revealed or manifeſted to their ſouls: And this is the reaſon there is ſo little love of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, becauſe there is ſo little manifeſtation of the Son of God in us: We think and ſay we know Chriſt more then all other men; but ſure we know him leſs, or elſe we would not love him leſs then others: For what ſhall we ſay, that the wiſe men from the Eaſt were miſtaken in their love of Chriſt, when they offered him gold, frankincenſe and myrrh, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 2.) but that we are now better inſtructed and directed in the love of Chriſt, whiles we take away all that we can rape and rend from him? This is in truth as unquoth an argument that we know him, as it is an unkind proof that we love him: himſelf hath taught us another leſſon, ſaying, <hi>he that hath my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelf to him; John</hi> 14. 21. We muſt love his Commandments that we may love him; and we muſt love him,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:114933:111"/>
that he may love us, and manifeſt himſelf unto us; for he will not manifeſt himſelf to thoſe whom he doth not love; and he doth not love thoſe who do not love him; and they do not love him, who do not keep his commandments; This is ſuch a Doctrine as our Saviour did not think he could teach too much, and therefore ſure we cannot learn enough: <hi>If ye love me keep my Commandments,</hi> John 14. 15. and ye <hi>are my friends if ye do whatſoever I command you, John</hi> 15. 14. Love is the inchoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of friendſhip, and that is not ſhewed without ſome obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>If ye love me keep my Commandments:</hi> But friendſhip is the conſummation of love, and that is not ſhewed without an univerſal obedience; <hi>Ye are my friends if ye do whatſoever I command you;</hi> he that will be thus univerſally obedient, muſt be ſure to interpret all Chriſts commands after the true rules of Logical ſuppoſition, that an univerſal Affirmative muſt hold in every particular, (as <hi>thou ſhalt love thy neigbbour as thy ſelf</hi>) muſt reach to all mankind, and to all offices of love; <hi>thou ſhalt honour thy father,</hi> muſt reach to all our governours, and to all offices of reverence and honour; We may not leave out any one particular either of the ſubject, or of the predicate, but we ſhall make a falſe ſuppoſition in Logick, and a falſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation in Divinity: And ſo on the other ſide, that an univerſal negative muſt hold in no one particular; as do no wrong, bindeth us to our good behaviour, not only in our word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                           <p>A little of this affection will more ſtrengthen my faith in Chriſt, then my greateſt perſwaſion can ſtrengthen it: And I ſhall more truly know my Saviour by devoting my <hi>will</hi> then my <hi>underſtanding</hi> to him, by <hi>obeying</hi> his law, then by <hi>ſtudying</hi> it; Therefore I will pray the Lord <hi>to make me increaſe and abound in love, to the end he may eſtabliſh my heart unblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in holineſs, 1 Theſ.</hi> 3. 12, 13. For himſelf hath told me, <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God, John</hi> 7. 17. That is, he, and he only ſhall have an experimental knowledge of Religion, that it will bring him to God, who labours to do the will of God; ſuch a man ſhall know that Chriſt is the way, the truth and the life, and that the Chriſtian Religion is the way to Chriſt, not only by a ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive knowledge which ſwims in his brain, and may be ejected thence by arguments of Sophiſtry; but alſo by an effective knowledge which ſinks into his heart, and which he will keep as carefully and as faithfully as he will keep his heart.</p>
                           <p>Thus to know Chriſt is truly to have him manifeſted in our ſouls: and this manifeſtation is not gotten ſo much by ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as by practice, not ſo much by knowing Gods will as by doing it: For it is undeniable by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> argument,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:114933:112"/>
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. That though Jeſus Chriſt were evidently ſet forth crucified among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> yet it was before their eyes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not in their hearts, whilſt they obeyed not the truth; And that the <hi>Jews</hi> had not known Chriſt, though he had ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his hands unto them all the day long, becauſe they were ſtill a diſobedient and a gainſaying people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 20, 21. And Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>hereby we do know that we do know him, if we keep his Commandments,</hi> 1 John 2. 3. Telling us of <hi>a twofold knowledge of God and of Chriſt,</hi> the one inefficacious to ſalvation, ſuch as hypocrites may have, who know God, but glorifie him not as God, <hi>Rom. 1. 21. or who profeſs that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and to every good work reprobate, Tit.</hi> 1. 16. The other is a ſaving knowledge of God and of Chriſt, ſuch as only good Chriſtians can have, who keep his Commandments; for this knowledge is joyned with obedience, and that is the cheif ground of its aſſurance; hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments: A man may have ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of faith without obedience, but he cannot have the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith without it: Whence we may gather that the true knowledge of God is not that which enables a man to talk ſublimely of his eſſence, or to talk confidently of his ſecrets, but that which knows him in his precepts, and in his promiſes, ſeriouſly obeying the one, no leſs then truly relying on the other; And only he that thus knows God, knows him truly to ſalvation, becauſe he only knows him truly in his Saviour: and only he ſo knows God as to love him, becauſe only he knows him in the Son of his love.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, it may be demanded, whether the <hi>Jews</hi> before the comming of Chriſt had the ſame love of God, that we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians now have; ſince they ſeem not to have had the ſame knowledge or manifeſtation of Chriſt? I anſwer, yes they had the ſame love of God; for they had the ſame knowledge or manifeſtation of Chriſt in <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> that we now have, though not the ſame <hi>in manner,</hi> nor in <hi>degree;</hi> They knew him to be the Mediator between God and man, as well as we, but they know this confuſedly and imperfectly, we now know it clearly, diſtinctly and perfectly: The difference was not in the ſubſtance of the knowledge, but in the manner and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:114933:113"/>
only: So that the <hi>Jews</hi> worſhipped God in Chriſt as we Chriſtians worſhip him; for in all their ſacrifices they did look upon the Meſſiah as the only propitiation for their ſins: Hence the 22. <hi>Pſalm</hi> was a part of their dayly morning ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which may not unfitly be called <hi>Chriſtus Patiens,</hi> for that it doth rather Hiſtorically then Prophetically ſet forth the paſſion of our bleſſed Saviour: For Chriſt upon the Croſs appropriated this <hi>Pſalm</hi> unto himſelf, by uſing the firſt words of it, <hi>My God my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> applieth it unto him in the eighth <hi>verſe, He truſted in God, let him deliver him now if he will have him;</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> in the eighteenth <hi>verſe, They parted my raiment among them, and for my veſture they did caſt lots:</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the twenty ſecond <hi>verſe, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midſt of the Church will I praiſe thee, (Heb.</hi> 2. 12.) Chriſt aſſumes this <hi>Pſalm</hi> to himſelf, whilſt he is in his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Apoſtles apply it to him whilſt they are deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of it; And this very <hi>Pſalm,</hi> amongſt all the reſt, was choſen out by the <hi>Jews</hi> to be a part of their dayly morning ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nay indeed it was compoſed of purpoſe by the Spirit of God, that it might be ſo; As plainly appears from the title or inſcription thereof, <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> offered all their ſacrifices in hopes of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in this Mediator; and what do we Chriſtians more, but believe and profeſs that our perſons and our prayers are accepted in him?

                           <p>GOD never yet had, never can have any true worſhip or glory, but only in Chriſt; Hence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>To God only wiſe be glory, through Jeſus Chriſt for ever, Rom.</hi> 16. 27. Take away Chriſt from the glory, and you were as good take away the glory from God: And again, <hi>unto him be glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus, throughout all ages, world without end, Eph</hi> 3. 21. This is the true Catholick Religion or worſhip of God, that obligeth all perſons <hi>in the Church,</hi> at all times, <hi>throughout all ages,</hi> and in all places, in heaven as well as in earth, <hi>world without end:</hi> for no worſhip can be world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, but that which ſhall be in heaven: And ſure we are the worſhip whereby we Chriſtians glorifie God, in and by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſhall be in heaven: The Jews worſhip, though in ſubſtance it was Chriſtian, yet the manner being figurative and typical, in extent it was but National, and in duration it was but temporal; But the Chriſtians worſhip being wholly in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and in truth, in the manner of it is angelical, in the extent of it is univerſal, in the continuance of it is eternal: The ſame to all ages that it is in this, the ſame in heaven that it is in earth: It is not ſafe for Chriſtians to worſhip God ſo now, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not worſhip him <hi>world without end.</hi> If they worſhip him now by his Son, they may ſo worſhip him for ever: But if they worſhip him now by any other Mediator, they are ſure they muſt leave that worſhip behind them, when they leave this world: and therefore they are on the ſurer ſide who had rather not take it, then be forced to leave it. For the Angels and Saints in heaven do not go to God by one another, but all go to him by his Son: and why ſhould we men on earth go to him by any other, then by him by whom they do go with us now, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:114933:114"/>
we ſhall go with them hereafter? Shall the Church Militant ſet up a Communion of Saints diſagreeing in the worſhip of God from the Church Triumphant? And why then doth the Canon of the Maſs begin with an Illative particle that hints a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion rather than a beginning, ſaying, <hi>Te igitur clementiſsime Pater per Jeſum Chriſtum filium tuum Dominum noſtrum ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces rogamus, : Therefore O moſt merciful Father we humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee by Jeſus Chriſt thy Son and our Lord, that thou wilt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe our gifts and ſacrifices;</hi> Why doth this particle <hi>Therefore</hi> begin the Prayers at the Maſs, but only to ſhew (as ſaith the Ritualiſt) that the Angels and Saints in heaven have begun, and that we men on earth do but only continue and as it were conclude this ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God? And why then ſhould we otherwiſe continue or conclude then they have begun it? Will they join with us in this our new worſhip? or is that not a new worſhip (meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our own inventing) wherein they cannot, will not join with us? Since they glorifie God only in Chriſt, how ſhall we venter to glorifie him in any other? unleſs we will perſwade God to accept one manner of glorifying him whiles it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and another manner of glorifying him, when it ſhall be our reward, and ſo make grace not the inchoation, but as it were the contradiction of glory? or unleſs we will perſwade our ſelves, that it is not beſt practiſing ſuch Songs on earth, as we know we ſhall ſing in heaven, but ſuch as we know we ſhall not ſing there, if ſo be our ſinging them here, do not indeed keep us from coming thither, and from ſinging there: nor is this a cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fear; For he that in the caſe of his worſhip hath proclaimed himſelf a jealous God, hath in effect told us that in that ſame caſe it is the beſt and ſureſt way for every man to have his fears and jealouſies. Thoſe holy prayers and praiſes which are offered up to God through Chriſt Jeſus, we are ſure do glorifie him: and conſequently we cannot but fear that thoſe which are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up unto him through any other Mediator, or Interceſſor do not, cannot tend to his glory: Nor is it either juſt or ſafe to appeal to the practiſe of Gods Church at any time, much leſs in the corrupteſt times, againſt the Precept of Gods Word: For we cannot be aſſured that any Church is his Church but from his word; and we are ſure that we have indeed the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:114933:115"/>
of a moſt infallible Doctor, if we can truly ſay that we have the determination of his ſpirit, in his holy Word: For as what prayers go from man to God by our Saviour Chriſt are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true worſhip: ſo what precepts come from God to man by him, are unqueſtionably true Doctrine; Wherefore ſince, <hi>See thou do it not, I am thy fellow ſervant, and of thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren thaet have the teſtimony of Jeſus, worſhip God,</hi> is one of his precepts, and that twice repeated almoſt in the very ſame words, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 9. &amp; 22. 9.

                           <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gives us ſuch a definition of a Mediator as will quite exclude all but one, and that is our bleſſed Saviour: <hi>Qui pro omnibus interpellat &amp; pro quo nullus, is verus eſt Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ac Interceſſor noſter, (lib. 2. contra Parmen. cap. 8.) He that intercedeth for all, and none intercedeth for him, is our true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and Interceſſor.</hi> Mark how he makes Mediator and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor both one, though ſome of late would make a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt them, by that new diſtinction of <hi>Mediator re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptionis &amp; interceſſionis;</hi> ſaying that Chriſt alone is a Mediator of Redemption, but Saints and Angels may alſo with him be Mediators of Interceſſion: A diſtinction not known in <hi>Aquinas</hi> his daies, who concludes poſitively that to be a Mediator betwixt God and man, is proper only to Chriſt, and proves his poſition by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>There is one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 5. He did not think of eluding this text by ſaying, <hi>Mediator eſt duplex, redemptionis &amp; interceſſionis:</hi> A Mediator is twofold, of Redemption and of Interceſsion; for that had been to ſay, <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus eſt duplex,</hi> one is two, a ſingular is a plural; for there cannot be the ground of a diſtinction unleſs there be two, and therefore a ſingular ſubject cannot be diſtinguiſhed but by making one two, or a ſingular a plural; and the Apoſtle having ſaid <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus Mediator,</hi> declared the ſubject of his propoſition ſo numerical and ſingular, that it could not be capable of a diſtinction: For it is not poſsible to make of one ſubject numerically the ſame, two ſpecifically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct: And it is evident that a Mediator meerly of interceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and not of redemption, is not a Mediator in the Apoſtles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for he proves that Chriſt only is a Mediator for all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

Doth not the blood of Chriſt ſpeak better things then the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> to my ſoul? and why ſhould I then not wholly pant and gaſp after his blood?

Can I beſtow any of my hope in praying to Saints and Angels, and none of my Faith and Charity go along with it? or have I too much of theſe excellent vertues in my ſoul, that I could take or tranſlate ſome part of them from my God, were they indeed to be fixed on any creature?

                           <p>Well then, <hi>&amp; Tutior &amp; Sanior pars</hi> muſt needs be my rule in a matter that ſo nearly concerns my Saviours honour, and mine own ſalvation; and I will leave the Saints out of my prayers, becauſe it is both ſafer and ſounder ſo to do: For all the world cannot object againſt me for going to God only by his Son, but I muſt object againſt my ſelf for going to God by the beſt of his ſervants in conjunction with, much more in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation to his Son: Wherefore I muſt reſolve to let the Saints ſtand in my Calander, but not let them come into my Liturgie, for fear I ſhould either exclude my Saviour out of his own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Interceſsion, or at leaſt exclude my ſelf and my prayers out of the bleſsing of his Communion: For this I am ſure of, He will not join with me in my prayers which I make to any but only to his Father; and it is dangerous for me to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Interceſsion, if not damnable for me to pray out of his Communion: Wherefore though others be careleſs in this point who pretend to a perfection, if not to a ſupererogation of righteouſneſs, yet I have work enough to pray againſt my ſins, dare not willingly admit a ſin into my prayers; for it was the curſe of <hi>Judas, Let his prayer be turned into ſin;</hi> and I dare not venter to bring that curſe upon my ſelf: For I that now
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:114933:116"/>
ask pardon for the ſins of my prayers, if I make my prayers more ſinful then my infirmities do make them for me, what ſhall I have left whereby to ask pardon for the ſinfulneſs of my ſins?</p>
                           <p>I will therefore ever give God humble and hearty thanks, that he hath cauſed me to be educated in a Church which hath taught me to make my addreſſes to him only in and by his Son; and I wil never ceaſe ſo to make my addreſſes to him, in behalf of that diſtreſſed and oppreſſed Church; For he that hath given us the parable of the importunate widow, <hi>to this end that we ſhould alwaies pray and not faint,</hi> will certainly hear our prayers and the prayers of his Church that is now a widow, and therefore brought to the ſtate of widow-hood and deſolation, becauſe we her ſons have hitherto been ſo ſlothful and ſluggiſh in our prayers, ſuffering them infinitely to out-ſtrip us in the practiſe, who came far ſhort of us in the purity of Devotion, and not ſhewing that zeal towards the eternal Son of God, which others have ſhewed and do ſtill ſhew towards their petty Deities; This our abominable neglect or rather contempt of God, hath made him jealous, and his jealouſie hath made him for a while caſt us off; but we hope he will not caſt us off for ever even for his Truths ſake, for his mercies ſake, for his names ſake; yea though we have ſlighted his Truth, abuſed his mercy, and blaſphemed his moſt Holy name; by throwing away our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with as much fury as if Truth had been a lye, Invocation had Superſtition, and Piety had been Idolatry; yet we will ſtill hope that he will not caſt us away for ever, for his Sons ſake, becauſe in him he is well pleaſed, though with us he be moſt juſtly diſpleaſed: For in him alone, in his merits, in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, in his interceſsion, have we called and do call for grace and mercy; and therefore cannot doubt but in him and for his ſake we ſhall be heard at laſt and relieved, and ſhall ſee the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our God: For the unrighteous Judge himſelf could ſay, <hi>Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet becauſe this widow troubleth me I will avenge her, leaſt by her continual coming ſhe weary me;</hi> Much more ſhall the righteous Judge ſay ſo: Yea O Lord we know that thou feareſt not thine enemies, but yet regardeſt thy ſervants, and therefore we thy moſt unworthy ſervants will never leave troubling thee with our continual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:114933:116"/>

Yea though thou ſtill more and more ſmite us into the place of Dragons (creatures that are both miſchievous and venemous) and cover us not only with the ſhadow, but even with the body of death; yet we will ever reſolve, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee to confirm and conſummate our reſolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) not to forget the name of our God, nor to ſtretch out, or hold up our hands to any ſtrang God; For thou haſt told us, <hi>This is life eternal that we might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent, (John</hi> 17. 3.) Lord, we deſire ſo to know thee as to love thee, ſo to love thee as to worſhip thee, ſo to worſhip thee as to glorifie thee, ſo to glorifie thee in this world, as to be glorified by thee in the world to come; Thou haſt commanded us to forſake all to follow thee; Lord make us readily to obey this command, that we may ſo follow thee, as at laſt to come <hi>to thee, to be with thee, and to abide in thee for ever.</hi> For thoſe who ſaw thy Son but in tpyes and figures, have taught us this leſſon of ſincerity and of conſtancy, not to be careful to anſwer any of our adverſaries in this matter: but readily and chearfully to ſay, <hi>Our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us;</hi> and he will (in his good time) deliver us: But if not, be it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:114933:117"/>
known unto all the world, that we will not worſhip the images which our Fathers have ſet up, nor the imaginations which our children are now ſetting up; for our God is too ſpiritual to be worſhipped with images, and too ſubſtantial to be worſhipped with imaginations: He is a Spirit, and <hi>they that worſhip him muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth, (Joh.</hi> 4. 24.) His wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath too much of Spirit to conſiſt in images, and too much of Truth to conſiſt in imaginations: Wherefore we knowing that our worſhip of God is both in Spirit and in Truth, are ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſee that any ſhould oppoſe it, (for it is prodigious, as well as odious, for any Chriſtian to oppoſe the glory of Chriſt) but will not give them that occaſion of joy, to ſee that their oppoſition ſhould make us forſake it; For he that hath ſaid, <hi>Seek ye after God, and your ſoul ſhall live, (Pſal.</hi> 69. 33.) hath taught us to ſay in our Doctrine, What ſhall we do with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that ſeeks after any but God, ſince our ſoul cannot live in any but in him? and much more hath he taught us to ſay in our devotion, <hi>Lord, we make our prayer unto thee in an acceptable time: Hear us O God in the multitude of thy mercies, even in the truth of thy ſalvation, Pſalm</hi> 69. which is a prayer in times of perſecution for the cauſe of Religion; For as long as we make our prayers only to thee O Lord, we are ſure that we do pray in the truth of our Religion; and therefore may not doubt but thou wilt at length hear our prayers in the truth of thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that for our bleſſed Saviours ſake, to whom with the Father and the eternal Spirit be all honour and glory now and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <p>Thus did the holy Apoſtles follow their Maſter with their eyes and with their hearts, when they could not follow him with their bodies; <hi>They looked ſtedfaſtly towards heaven,</hi> as he went up, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 10. Surely the more to fix their hearts on him when he was above: And ſo muſt we too; we muſt go up with him thither, that we may tarry with him there; accordingly as Chriſts own Church hath taught us to pray, <hi>Grant we beſeech thee Almighty God, that like as we do believe thine only begotten Son our Lord to have aſcended into the heavens; ſo we may alſo in heart and mind thither aſcend, and with him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually dwell, who liveth and raigneth with thee and the Holy Ghoſt, one God world without end:</hi> which is ſuch an heavenly prayer, That we are infinitely bound to bleſs God for putting it into our devotions, but yet more bound to beſeech him that he will alſo put it into our lives and converſations.</p>
                        <p>For which cauſe I will enlarge my conſiderations concerning the aſcention of our bleſſed Saviour: And as <hi>Binius</hi> in ſetting down that vaſt and voluminous Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> digeſteth his work into three Tomes, in the firſt tome reciting, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the acts before the Council: in the ſecond Tome, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, the acts done after the Council; So will I conſider the hiſtory of our bleſſed Saviours Aſcention, firſt inſiſting upon thoſe things which are recorded before it, <hi>His apparitions, his inſtructions, his conſolations, and his benedictions:</hi> Secondly, inſiſting upon thoſe things which are recorded concerning the manner of his aſcending: And laſtly inſiſting upon that one thing which is recorded of him after he was aſcended, <hi>viz.</hi> his ſitting at the right hand of God.</p>
                        <p>And I have warrant enough ſo to do from the two Pen-men of that very Hiſtory: For Saint <hi>Mark</hi> deſcribeth the Aſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with reference to Chriſts Apparitions upon the very day of his reſurrection, though that was full fourty daies before he aſcended; for ſo we read, <hi>Mar. 16. 14. Afterward he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the eleven as they ſate at meat, and upbraided their unbelief and hardneſs of heart;</hi> which apparition was clearly on the very
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:114933:118"/>
day of his Reſurrection, unleſs we will ſay, that unbelief and hardneſs of heart remained in the Apoſtles, when it ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in any of the other Diſciples: for he had appeared unto them no leſs then five ſeveral times on that very day, for the confirmation of their faith: And yet without any mention of more apparitions, it followeth, <hi>v. 19. So then after the Lord had ſpoken unto them, he was received up into heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But Saint <hi>Luke</hi> deſcribeth the Aſcention with the ſending down of the Holy Ghoſt, which was not till ten daies after our Saviour Chriſt was actually aſcended, as appears, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>But ye ſhall receive power after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you:</hi> And <hi>when he had ſpoken theſe things, he was taken up;</hi> The Aſcention is ſo placed in the narrations of theſe Evangeliſts, as both to look backward to the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and forward to the Feaſt of Pentecoſt; To look backward upon the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God the Son; to look forward upon the Deſcention of God the Holy Ghoſt: Happily to teach all Chriſtians, That they muſt firſt ariſe from ſin, before they can aſcend up to God; there's the Reſurrection before the Aſcention: And that they muſt aſcend up to God, before they can receive the gifts and graces of his Holy Spirit; there's the Aſcention before the coming of the Holy Ghoſt. However this is ground enough for me to look a little backward and a little forward in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of the Aſcention, becauſe the Evangeliſts have thus related it with its antecedent apparitions and words, and with its conſequent exaltation, or ſitting on the right hand of God.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:114933:119"/>
thoſe Heavenly doctrines pertaining to the kingdom of God, concerning which he reſolved to ſpeak with them from that day till the time of his Aſcention.</p>
                           <p>The firſt apparition was to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> alone, as ſaith St. <hi>Mark, Now when Jeſus was riſen early the firſt day of the week, He appeared firſt to</hi> Mary Magdalen, <hi>out of whom he had caſt ſeven Devils, Mark</hi> 16. 9. Which muſt needs be the grand comfort of any ſinfull, and ſin-ſick man that though he hath very impure and unclean thoughts and inclinations which do poſſeſs him, like ſo many devils, yet if he fly to his Saviour for relief, he will immediately caſt out thoſe devils, and likewiſe ſhew himſelf unto him in the bright beams of his grace and mercy, as ſoon as to others that can boaſt of a much greater Purity: But yet ſure this firſt appearing of Chriſt to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> did neither give nor beſpeak her any priviledge or prerogative above others; It only ſhewed that he who came into the world to ſave ſinners, would not have them diſcouraged or diſ-heartned becauſe of their ſins, after their conſciences had been throughly purged from dead works by faith and repentance.</p>
                           <p>Yet ſome men in theſe latter ages of the Church, thinking thoſe had a real preheminence above others to whom Chriſt firſt ſhewed himſelf after his reſurrection, would needs phanſie our bleſſed Saviour to have appeared firſt to his own Mother; So <hi>Durand</hi> in his Rationals, <hi>(lib. 6. in rubrica de ſeptem diebus poſt Paſcha) Quidam dicunt, in ipſâ etiam reſurrectionis die primò apparuit Matri; Some men ſay that on the very day of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he firſt appeared to his mother;</hi> which is directly contrary to the Text; for if firſt to his mother, then not firſt to <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> Theſe men were ſo reſolved to accumulate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminencies upon the bleſſed Virgin, that they feared not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Text, meerly to force upon her this imaginary privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or prerogative.</p>
                           <p>The like is <hi>Baronius</hi> his Logick, <hi>(Anno Chriſti 16. num. 8.) <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde inferri poteſt in titulo crucis Domini, non eo ordine quo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſentur ab Evangeliſtis, Inſcriptiones eſſe poſitas:</hi> His drift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to advance the Latine tongue, (that all the world forſooth might uſe it in their Liturgies) he would fain perſwade us that the Inſcriptions upon our Saviours croſs were not reckoned up in order as they were written, but that the Latine was before the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:114933:120"/>
Hebrew and the Greek Inſcriptions. His aim was to extoll his Churches language; but this was no right way of extolling it, to give it a priority of order againſt the Text, nay againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of our Saviours croſs, that are daily ſhewed and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the firſt inſcription is in Hebrew, the ſecond in Greek, the laſt in Latine; ſo that either <hi>Baronius</hi> is falſe, or the Reliques are falſe, ſaith <hi>Cauſabon, Ergo vel Baronius falſus, vel reliquiae falſae.</hi> It ſeems he thought not of the reliques, or happily he would not have diſproved them; but tis evident he thought of the text, and cared not to diſprove that; This is the <hi>jumbling of Scripture,</hi> which ſome will rather uſe then want arguments to juſtifie their own parties or phanſies; One ſaith the Latine was firſt written, though the Hebrew and Greek be firſt named; others ſay, though <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was firſt named, yet ſhe was not firſt meant, but that the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> muſt ſtep in before her. Theſe Divines are not ſo moderate, ſo ingenuous in their Divinity, as <hi>Gregory Naz.</hi> was in his Poetry, in his tragedy of <hi>Chriſtus Patiens.</hi> For although he allows Saint <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> to ſay to the bleſſed Virgin, (as he ſuppoſeth them both going together to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,) <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>Sure you ſhall ſee him above any other,</hi> yet when Chriſt comes indeed to be ſeen, Tis <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> firſt ſpies him, and firſt ſpeaks of his appearance. For when the text ſaith expreſly he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> tis no leſs then blaſphemy to ſay he appeared firſt to his own mother; for it is in effect to contradict the Holy-Ghoſt, and to call that ſecond which he called firſt.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond apparition was to the ſame <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other women, even thoſe who had prepared their ſpices and ointments, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 1. &amp; 10. O my God, let me never ceaſe to prepare for thee ſpices and ointments, even the ſweet odours of praiſe and thankſgiving joyned with the tears of an unfeigned repentance and the oyle of good works, that the Sun of righteouſneſs may ariſe to me with healing in his wings, and ſhew me the light of his countenance, and I may be healed of all thoſe wounds whereby I have ſo long weakned, and ſo grievouſly tormented mine own ſoul.</p>
                           <p>The third apparition was to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alone, as ſaith Saint
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:114933:120"/>
                              <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 15. 5. He was ſeen of Cephas, then of the twelve,</hi> which is Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ninth prerogative in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; <hi>Nona eſt quod Chriſtus reſurgens primùm omnium ex Apoſtolis Petro ſe videndum praebuerit; (lib. 1. de Pontif. Rom. cap.</hi> 18.) But if this third apparition to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him above the reſt of the Apoſtles, how did not the firſt apparition to Saint <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> advance her above Saint <hi>Peter?</hi> Why ſhould we not rather ſuppoſe, that our bleſſed Saviour made ſuch haſte to appear to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe he knew he was ſtill under the ſorrow and burden of his three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold denyal; for ſome of the antients were of opinion that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> never left weeping for denying his Maſter, from the time of his death tell he ſaw him riſen again from the dead: So <hi>Sabellicus, lib. 5. exemp. cap. 5. Tribuunt lachrymis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiſſe, &amp;c. He wept bitterly all thoſe three dayes wherein he had loſt his Maſter;</hi> and the rather certainly, becauſe he had denyed him, before he loſt him; This reaſon is in effect the ſame with that before, concerning the firſt apparition to Saint <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> and tis more agreeable with true Divinity to magnifie Saint <hi>Peter</hi> for his Repentance, then for his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; and queſtionleſs he himſelf had rather be ſo magnified; However this we are ſure, that ſome very good Divines have given us this ſame gloſs, though upon another text: For upon thoſe words of Saint <hi>Mark, Go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>ell his Diſciples, and Peter, (Mar.</hi> 16. 7.) The reaſon why Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is particularly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, is thus given by <hi>Theophylact, ut ſcrupulus illi adimeretur quo poterat jure ſolicitari, ne propter trinam abnegationem, diſcipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li jure excidiſſet, To take that ſcruple out of his mind</hi> which might then juſtly trouble him, leaſt by thrice denying his maſter, he had loſt the priviledge or right of a Diſciple, <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, (are the fathers own words,) Chriſt firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that he might ſhew him, he was not caſt off becauſe of his threefold denyal. The ſame reaſon is in effect given by Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> as ſaith the learned <hi>Cauſabone,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>becauſe he alone had denyed his Maſter, and had reaſon to be afraid of appearing in his preſence.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ſame reaſon is moreover given by Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the great; <hi>Si hunc angelus nominatim non exprimeret, qui magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum negaverat, venire inter Diſcipulos non auderet: If the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel

And to all theſe I will add yet one more, the Expoſition of one as much addicted to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy as <hi>Baronius,</hi> but much more to ſubſtantial Divinity, and that was <hi>Franciſcus Lucas Brugenſis,</hi> who thus gloſſeth the words, <hi>Dicite diſcipulis, &amp; Petro; Petrum nominatim exprimit ne ille exiſtimaret ſe ex diſcipulis non haberi, qui praeceptorem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gâſſet; ne putaret ſe loco excidiſſe, qui turpiter adeò offendiſſet: Sciret contra, ſe ob poenitentiam, quae &amp; Deo placuerat &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelis, in gratiam ac priſtinum inter diſcipulos locum receptum eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, ſibique proinde ut capiti, caeteros in Galilaeam eſſe ducendos:</hi> He expreſly nameth Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> leſt he ſhould think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not one of the Diſciples, who had denied his Maſter; leſt he ſhould think himſelf fallen from his place, who had ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully offended; contrary, that he might know how by his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which had pleaſed both God and Angels, he was reſtored into favour and to his former place among the Diſciples, and that all the reſt ſhould be gathered to him as to their head, in Galilee.</p>
                           <p>He was willing enough to bring in the Primacy, (as appears by this laſt clauſe) but he would by no means leave out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; taking it for granted that our bleſſed Saviour had the greateſt regard to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe he ſaw him ſo exceeding penitent. O my God, give unto me a heart truly ſorrowful for what evil I have committed and daily do commit, that thou maiſt give unto me a heart truly thankful for what good I have received and daily do receive, and that thou maiſt make me fully capable of receiving the greateſt good thou haſt in ſtore for a penitent ſinner, even the forgiveneſs of my ſins, and the comfortable aſſurance of that forgiveneſs ſealed unto my conſcience by the Teſtimony of thy holy ſpirit, and the amendment of mine own ſinful life, that ſo thou maiſt ſhew unto me the merits of my Saviour, and give unto me the joy of his ſalvation.

ſorrow for my ſins, and may have thy comforts in my ſorrows, <hi>looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; (Tit.</hi> 2. 13.)</p>
                           <p>The fourth apparition, which our bleſſed Saviour made on the very day of his reſurrection, was that to the two Diſciples as they were going to <hi>Emmaus:</hi> which was next after that to Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> for it is plain that when they returned to <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> they found the eleven gathered together, ſaying, The Lord is riſen indeed, and hath appeared unto <hi>Simon, (Luke</hi> 24. 34.) And how was it that he appeared to thoſe two? The text ſaith, <hi>they talked together of all thoſe things which had happened, and it came to paſs that while they communed together, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, Jeſus himſelf drew near, and went with them, (Luke</hi> 24. 14, 15.) They were making great lamentation that the cheif Prieſts and Rulers had condemned to death and crucified one that was a Prophet mighty indeed and word before God and all the people, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 19, 20.) for as yet they took Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a Prophet: Could the loſs of one Prophet ſo afflict them? and ſhall not the loſs of many Prophets more grievouſly afflict us? Can we ſee the deſtruction of a whole national Church, wherein God was ſo truly glorified, and Gods truth ſo impartially maintained, to the envy of her enemies, to the admiration of her friends, and not be troubled for Gods ſake, as well as for our own, that we ſhould be ſo groſly unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God for not removing his Candleſtick, as our ſelves meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of wantonneſs, playing with the light to put out the Candle? Can we ſee the deſolation of ſo many Prophets to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, (as if they had rather been Felons then Prophets) without tears in our eyes, complaints in our mouths, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in our hearts? Is it not a moſt terrible ſight to ſee a whole member at once torn away from Chriſt's myſtical body? or can there be any thing more terrible then this dividing of a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from the body, unleſs it be the dividing of the body from the head? and where the one is actually done, may not the other juſtly be feared? In ſuch a diſmal conjuncture of ſo many ſins and ſorrows together, (but yet more ſins then ſorrows) what hath any good Chriſtians left to do but <hi>to go to Emmaus,</hi> to retire himſelf to ſome place of ſolitarineſs, and there to lament and bewail his own ſad condition, that by his ſins he hath cauſed
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:114933:122"/>
ſo many labourers to be caſt out of the Lords Vineyard, when as he is no more able by his righteouſneſs to deſerve, then others are able by their power to make ſo much as one true labourer: And ſure he is, he can never want ſuch lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as God will accept, whilſt he hath ſuch as God himſelf hath made, and practiſed; and ſuch are to be had in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> For God the Holy-Ghoſt made thoſe Lamentations, and the Prophet uttered them in the perſon of God the Son; So that the badneſs of the occaſion being more then recompenced by the goodneſs of the company, let him ſigh with himſelf and ſay, <hi>Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſs by? behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow, which is done unto me; wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger, Lam.</hi> 1. 12. For he may well ſay this, when he cannot but ſay what follows, <hi>cap. 2. ver. 6. The Lord was an enemy, he hath ſwallowed up Iſrael, and he hath violently taken away his Tabernacle; he hath deſtroyed his pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the aſſembly; The Lord hath cauſed the ſolemn Feaſts and Sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath deſpiſed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of his anger the King, and the Prieſt;</hi> I will then leave the pomps and vanities of this wicked world before they leave me, and go to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> to ſome place of privacy, and there ſit down and conſider what I have loſt, (not of my temporal, but of my ſpiritual inheritance,) that I may accordingly bewail and lament my loſſes; for I who regarded not my Saviour as the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of peace (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6.) muſt now regard him as he is deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3.) till by my hearty ſorrow and inceſſant ſupplications I may get him to return again as it were by a glorious reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection after death, and in his power as the mighty God to reſtore his Church, in his mercy as the everlaſting Father to bleſs it; and in his dominion as the Prince of peace, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and eſtabliſh it for ever: Thus had I rather ſuffer with him in his ſhame, then reign with his enemies in their glory; and I ſhall rejoyce more in my ſorrows, then they ſhall in their joyes; For in their joyes, they may if they will, ſee their ſins; but in my ſorrows, I ſhall ſee my Saviour.</p>
                           <p>The fifth and laſt apparition which our bleſſed Saviour made
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:114933:122"/>
on the day of his reſurrection, was that which Saint <hi>Mark</hi> hath recorded in theſe words, <hi>(Cap. 16. ver. 14.) After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he appeared to the eleven as they ſate at meat, and upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them with their unbelief and heardneſs of heart, becauſe they believed not them which had ſeen him after he was riſen.</hi> Our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour upbraided them, yet were they more truly <hi>believers in their unbelief,</hi> then many of us are <hi>in our faith;</hi> for Saint <hi>Luke</hi> faith, <hi>They yet believed not for joy and wondred (Luk.</hi> 24. 41.) They believed not for joy and admiration; but many of us ſo believe, as neither to rejoyce nor admire at the grounds of our belief; in ſo much that their <hi>infidelity</hi> was much better then our <hi>faith;</hi> for we have too haſty a faith, to have a ſure and a ſound faith, and that makes us fall away in theſe times of temptation, and rather then want temptation, become our own tempters: Whereas if we did with the <hi>Bereans</hi> examine whether theſe things were ſo before we believed, or with the Apoſtles did rejoyce and admire to ſee them ſo when we believe, it would not be poſſible for thoſe that can ſo eaſily turn the times, more eaſily to turn our faith, but being ſure that we are indeed in a true conjunction and communion with Chriſt, we would never ſuffer any thing of this world to ſeparate us from that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjunction, nor to divert us from that bleſſed communion. Thus it is for want of joy and admiration that we dayly turn unbelievers, whereas the Apoſtles did not yet believe for joy and wonder; therefore were they the more true believers; for what kept them from believing, did in truth ſtrengthen their belief.</p>
                           <p>And accordingly we may ſuppoſe our bleſſed Saviour check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their incredulity, not ſo much that he might blame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their faith, as that they might the more labour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and to improve it; for that they could never have that faith too much ſetled and fixed in themſelves, which they were now bound to preach to others: And withall, that they ſhould not be ſoon diſcouraged in their preaching, if they found not the event preſently anſwerable to their pains, ſince it was long before they themſelves did believe, though they had met with infinitely a far better Preacher: For this Rule, <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrenghthen thy brethren, (Luk.</hi> 22. 32.) holds not only in the ſubſtance but alſo in the degree of that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:114933:123"/>
charitable duty, thoſe being bound to take the greateſt pains in converting others, who moſt know, how much the ſpirit of God hath laboured about their converſion; For he that conſiders how long his Saviour hath tarryed for him, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think that he can tarry too long for his brother. And yet there is one more particular very obſervable in this apparition, that it was when the Apoſtles were gathered together to hear what Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt could ſay concerning their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters reſurrection; <hi>And as they thus ſpake, Jeſus himſelf ſtood in the midſt of them, Luke</hi> 24. 36. That is then, and not till then, he appeared to them, when they were thus prepared to receive him. O my God, make me zealouſly to follow all thoſe means which thou haſt given me of knowing thy eternal Son, my bleſſed Lord and Saviour; that purſuing after thoſe means with an active induſtry, I may overtake them with a happy ſpeed, and lay hold on them with immortal joy, and make uſe of them with unwearied care and conſtancy: Let me never abſent my ſelf from the aſſemblies and meetings of thy Apoſtles, the guides and governours of thy Church, for fear I ſhould loſe the opportunity of ſeeing thee, whilſt I am abſent from them; For thou haſt promiſed to be with them alway, even to the end of the world; if therefore I will not be with them, how can I hope thou wilt be with me? For ſurely of all men that are gathered together in thy name, upon the face of the earth, they are moſt ſo gathered whom thou haſt commanded to gather others, and therefore thou haſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be moſt in the midſt of them; for as much as they are thy Truſtees, whom thou haſt entruſted with thy name, and with thy truth, and with thy blood; with thy name, leſt Atheiſts ſhould blaſpheme it; with thy truth, leſt Hereticks ſhould corrupt it; with thy blood, leſt Apoſtates ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane it; O then let thy unworthy ſervant be alwayes gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together with them, that I be never guilty either of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, or of Hereſie, or of Apoſtaſie: And when I am gathered together with them, make me to open mine eyes to look, and mine ears to hearken diligently after thee, and not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, that thou mayeſt open my heart to receive thee.</p>
                           <p>And make all guides and governours of thy Church ſtill to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:114933:123"/>
follow the footſteps of thy Apoſtles, and to enquire <hi>what is written in the Law of Moſes and in the Prophets, and in the Pſalms concerning thee, ver.</hi> 44. For how ſhall they know thee, to whom thou doſt not reveal thy ſelf? or where doſt thou reveal thy ſelf but in thy word? <hi>Then opened he their underſtanding, that they might underſtand the Scriptures, (Luke</hi> 24. 45) that is, when they had uſed all the means they could to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, then and not till then he opened their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And who can tell but tis a judgement immediately from God, and a judgement worthy of God, inflicted upon many great Scholars, not to underſtand the Scriptures ſo much to their ſalvation, as ſome private unlearned men do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them; becauſe they had rather caſt their reproaches then their affections upon Gods moſt holy word, inventing arguments to keep others from reading it, whilſt they ſhould be making prayers that God would bleſs their own reading of it! for unleſs he that hath the key of <hi>David</hi> open the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, in vain do we labour to open the Text: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of England did upon unqueſtionable grounds recede from the Latine Liturgy in the ſecond Sunday of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, to bring in this moſt excellent prayer, <hi>Bleſſed Lord, which haſt cauſed all holy Scriptures to be written for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, grant that we may in ſuch wiſe hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digeſt them, that by patience and comfort of thy holy word, we may embrace and ever hold faſt the bleſſed hope of everlaſting life which thou haſt given us in our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> I doubt not but the Church might for her liberty have changed more of thoſe Collects then ſhe thought fit to change, but infinitely bleſs God that ſhe valued her Chriſtian charity above her Chriſtian liberty, ſo that ſhe hath never at all changed but for the better; not deſiring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from other Chriſtians, but only to come nearer to our Saviour Chriſt: And truly when the Conteſt was once broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, between the Church and the Scriptures in point of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, (the moſt unhappy Conteſt that ever was broached among Chriſtians, for ſome Church men; by laying aſide the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chriſt did in effect teach other men to lay aſide the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church) I ſay when this unhappy Conteſt was once broached between the Church and the Scriptures in point
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:114933:124"/>
of Authority, it was high time for our Church to cleave to the Scriptures, that ſhe might profeſs her deſire and intention of remaining truly Chriſtian, wherein ſhe did but follow Saint <hi>Peters</hi> own example, ſaying, <hi>Lord, to whom ſhall we go? Thou haſt the words of eternal life: John</hi> 6 68. For ſurely our bleſſed Saviour did not bring down with him the words of eternal life to carry them back again to heaven, but to leave them here on Earth; and where hath he left them, if not in the holy Scriptures? Wherefore ſince Chriſt himſelf alledged the Scriptures to confirme the Apoſtles in their faith, who yet believed becauſe they had ſeen him with their their own eyes, (<hi>John</hi> 20. 29) How ſhall any Chriſtian Church deny the People to read the Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not hinder the confimation of their faith in Chriſt? For when the Church hath done all that ſhe can to make true believers, ſhe muſt confeſs that their faith doth not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God; (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5.) and that the word of God is the chiefeſt inſtrument of his Power, according to that of the holy Apoſtle, <hi>For the word of God is quick and powerfull, and ſharper then any two edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and ſpirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, Heb.</hi> 4. 12. In which words, the Spirit of God ſetteth forth the excellency of the word of God, from its nature, and from its effects: from its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that it is <hi>quick and powerfull,</hi> neither a dull nor a dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but quick in motion and powerfull in operation; from its effects, that it <hi>pierceth,</hi> that it <hi>devideth,</hi> that it <hi>diſcerneth</hi> the thoughts and intents of the Heart; Piercing the thoughts by entring into the botom of our hearts, to make us ſound and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtians againſt Hypocriſie; Dividing the thoughts by ſeparating good from evil, Truth from falſhood, in our Religion, to make us Orthodox Chriſtians, againſt Hereſie; and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the thoughts, by ſhewing us the firſt truth and the chiefeſt good in our religion, to make us firm and conſtant Chriſtians, againſt Apoſtaſie; For that man never yet diſcovered Chriſt in his Religion, who could be perſwaded to fall away from it. He was at the beſt but a divider of the truth from falſhood, He was not a Diſcerner of the firſt Truth in that Truth which he profeſſed; for then he would have been immovable in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:114933:124"/>
Wherefore if you would indeed perſwade or rather tempt me, (for tis properly a temptation, which induceth to evil) to leave the Scriptures that I may cleave to the Church, you muſt firſt be able to ſhew ſo much in behalf of the Church as is here ſaid in behalf of the Scriptures, or you were as good perſwade and tempt me to quit my reaſon, that I may get Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; or to ceaſe to be a man, that I may begin to be a Chriſtian.</p>

                           <p>THE proper work of a Chriſtian is to conſider and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template his Saviour Chriſt, in all his ſayings and in all his doings; (for never any ſpeak like him who was the eternal word of God, never any did like him who was the eternal ſon of God:) but more particularly in thoſe which come neereſt his Aſcention; for all thoſe his ſayings and doings do more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and directly concern the Conſtitution and the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Church, it pleaſing the bleſſed Redeemer and lover of Souls to give his ſpecial directions and inſtructions to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtles, when he was even now to be taken away from them; that ſo he might leave behind him in their minds the ſtronger impreſsions of his all-ſaving Truth, and the greater aſſurance and perſwaſions of his everlaſting love. Wherefore though no one word that ever our bleſſed Saviour was pleaſed to ſpeak either concerning his love towards us, or our duty towards him, ſhould be let fall to the ground without our obſervation, becauſe he was ſo much our friend: yet the words that he ſpake laſt of all ſhould moſt diligently be received, moſt carefully retained, and moſt conſcionally regarded, becauſe they were the words not only of a loving but alſo of a parting friend: and by conſequent ſuch words as ſhould both repreſent him, and comfort us during his

abſence, though never ſo long, and keep him in our remembrance till his coming again, when he will undoubtedly exact a ſevere account both of the Miniſters &amp; of the people how they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved thoſe words. For this cauſe though our bleſſed Saviour did after the day of his Reſurrection, make five more apparitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Aſcenſion, as that after eight dayes when S. <hi>Thomas</hi> was now with the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 26.

And we cannot deny but theſe ſame words, or at leaſt words to this effect, were ſolemnly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at three ſeveral times by our bleſſed Saviour to his Apoſtles, that is to ſay, On the day of his Reſurrection, and afterwards again in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and yet a third time alſo after that immediately before his Aſcention, to ſhew what a neceſſity was laid upon them to diſcharge that ſacred function, when he thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſo often to repeat their charge, as if it had been his only bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs from his Reſurrection to his Aſcention.</p>
                           <p>And doubtleſs, if we ſeriouſly conſier the words themſelves, we ſhall eaſily ſee and willingly confeſs, that as they did concern the conſtitution of the Church at that time, ſo they do concern the conſtitution of the Church at this day, and will concern both its conſtitution and conſervation to the worlds end. I will accordingly explain them briefly, as I find them in the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, yet ſo as to make Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> the ſtandard for the reſt, having already explained the words, as they are recorded by Saint <hi>John:</hi> And thus Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> records the words, <hi>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;</hi> our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had all the power of heaven and earth given to him from the Father, both as he was the Son of God, and as he was the Son of man; as he was the Son of God, ſo this power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by eternal generation; as he was the Son of man, ſo the ſame power was given him by free donation: partly at his firſt conception, by vertue of his union with the God-head, but more fully after his reſurrection, for the merit of his death and paſſion: So that though he exerciſed this power in his life time by chooſing Apoſtles; and inſtituting the Holy Sacraments, yet after he was riſen again he exerciſed the ſame much more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in a threeſold reſpect, <hi>Quoad modum, quoad ſtatum, quoad uſum:</hi> Firſt becauſe he was poſſeſſed of it after a more excellent manner, as having merited it by his death: Secondly becauſe he was poſſeſſed of it in a more excellent ſtate, as now being paſt all fear and danger of dying: Thirdly becauſe he
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:114933:126"/>
was poſſeſſed of it for a more excellent end, as being how to uſe it, not for the converſion of one people, but of all the world, as it follows, <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations: Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> relying upon my authority which is founded upon all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er both in heaven and in earth, whereas any authority that can forbid you to go, is founded only upon the power in earth.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>And teach all Nations,</hi>) This the Apoſtles could not do; (no more then they could continue to the end of the world) in their own perſons; Therefore our Saviour Chriſt ſpeaks theſe words to their Succeſſors, as well as to them; And ſo this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept was given to make good that Promiſe, <hi>Mat. 24. 14. The Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall be preached in all the world, for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto all Nations; and then ſhall the end come.</hi> For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves did not, could not, preach the Goſpel in all the world, and unto all Nations: therefore they were to ordain others to preach it after them, nor may we ſuppoſe the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel to have been a Temporary calling, or oppoſe them in their Miniſtry, unleſs we will reſiſt the fulfilling of Cbriſts promiſe, and do what we can to make Truth himſelf a lyar.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>) The Apoſtles were commanded to baptize in this form for three reaſons; 1. To diſtinguiſh Chriſtians from Jews; for they worſhipped God only in the unity of eſſence as their Creator; but the Chriſtians are to worſhip him in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of perſons, as their Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier. 2. To ſhew that here was nothing of humane invention or power to be given or received in baptiſm, which was in the name of God only. 3. To ſhew that there was great vertue and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy in Baptiſm, even ſuch as did concern our re-union with God, by remiſſion of our ſins, and ſanctification of our ſouls, or why elſe ſhould we be baptized in the name of God? And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that all that vertue and efficacy did wholly depend upon God alone, in whoſe name only we are to be baptized.</p>
                           <p>And this efficacy of Baptiſm is more fully expreſſed by Saint <hi>Mark</hi> ſaying, <hi>He that believeth and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved, Mark</hi> 16. 16. where it is plain that the Apoſtles are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to invite men to the Chriſtian Faith and Baptiſm by the promiſe of ſalvation; and conſequently are forbidden to preach
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:114933:127"/>
ſalvation upon any other terms then thoſe of believing and of being baptized: And thoſe men who make ſo ſlight account of Baptiſm, will one day find the Heathens and Infidels of <hi>Syria</hi> to riſe up againſt them in judgement, who ſaid to their Maſter <hi>Naaman, My Father, If the Prophet had bid thee do ſome great thing, wouldſt thou not have done it? how much rather then when he ſaith to thee, Waſh and be clean? 2 King.</hi> 5. 13. For they dare not deny but they are as unclean as <hi>Naaman</hi> was in his leproſie, unleſs they will deny themſelves to be of the ſame mould and make with other men; for <hi>David</hi> hath ſpoken in the perſon of every man that is born of a woman, <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me, Pſalm</hi> 51. 5. And they cannot deny but that God (ſince <hi>Naamans</hi> time) hath moſt eminently <hi>ſanctified the flood</hi> Jordan, <hi>and</hi> (in that) <hi>all other waters, by the Baptiſm of his well beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the myſtical waſhing away of ſin:</hi> And yet moreover, That not only the man of God, but alſo the Son of God hath ſaid unto them, <hi>Waſh and be clean;</hi> unleſs they will divide the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>waſh,</hi> from the promiſe, <hi>and be clean,</hi> ſince the words have been in our Saviours mouth, which the Infidels durſt not do when they were only in <hi>Eliſha's</hi> mouth.</p>
                           <p>For it is moſt certain that Baptiſm is neceſſary to ſalvation as commanded, (<hi>waſh</hi>) and it is moſt probable, that it is alſo efficacious thereunto (<hi>and be clean</hi>) becauſe it is commanded: For he that hath commanded it was able to make it ſo, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath made it ſo, to ſhew that he delighteth not in unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or unprofitable commands: What need we then to ſay That Baptiſm is neceſſary only as a profeſsion of our faith, or as an outward ſign or teſtimony of Gods grace, whereas we may with much confidence and without any inconveniency acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be moreover an inſtrumental cauſe whereby our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour is pleaſed to work Grace and Salvation? For who can hinder the firſt cauſe to work by what inſtrument he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? and ſure we are, the word of God doth plainly aſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Baptiſm the operation of an inſtrumental cauſe in working the effect of grace, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it <hi>The waſhing of Regeneration, Tit.</hi> 3. 5. which was the language he had been taught by God himſelf at his firſt converſion, ſaying to him by <hi>Ananias, Ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, Acts</hi> 22. 16.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="113" facs="tcp:114933:127"/>Wherefore we will conclude that both Faith and Baptiſm may be rightly called inſtrumental cauſes of our ſalvation, but in different reſpects; Faith as inſtrumental on our parts, whereby we prepare our ſelves for Chriſt; Baptiſm as inſtrumental on Chriſts part, whereby he prepareth us for himſelf: This being granted, which can ſcarce reaſonably be denyed, we ſhall not delay our childrens Baptiſm becauſe tis inſtrumental to ſalvation on Chriſts part, though not on their own; and yet not tie God to outward means, becauſe we acknowledge Baptiſm to be inſtrumental to ſalvation only upon his own choice and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore he can ſave without it, if himſelf ſo pleaſeth. Nor ſhall we need fear a falling away from the ſtate of ſalvation any more in the baptized Infants, then in the believing men, ſince our bleſſed Saviour in ſaying, <hi>he that believeth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſhall be ſaved,</hi> doth ſuppoſe or rather include the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as alike neceſſary to both, to wit, of leading their lives according to their good beginnings: For the promiſe of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon a mans believing and being baptized, is not abſolute but conditional, that is to ſay, If he lead his life anſwerable to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This interpretation muſt be given of our Saviours words, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the foregoing part of his ſpeech, <hi>Go and preach the Goſpel;</hi> for tis moſt certain that he would not have his Apoſtles preach any other Goſpel then what himſelf had preached, and that was, <hi>Repent ye and believe, Mar.</hi> 1. 15. Wherefore Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance muſt alſo come in as a neceſſary condition to ſalvation no leſs then faith and Baptiſm, becauſe all men do fall away from the purity which they had through their Faith, and through their Baptiſm, by their daily ſins; and there is no promiſe of ſalvation to any man that continueth and abideth in his ſins; ſo that they muſt riſe again by repentance or they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved.</p>

                              <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the City of God, had been turned into <hi>Sodom,</hi> a cage of unclean birds for its impurity; into an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> a field of blood for its cruelty; yet here is ſuch a promiſe annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:114933:131"/>
to it, as makes Chriſts Diſciples willing to bear with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities and to bear the cruelties; For it is an <hi>Eliſha</hi> promiſe, which ſignifieth, <hi>My God ſaveth;</hi> And no wonder then if it hath the power of reviving the Soul, as <hi>Eliſha's</hi> bones did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive a dead body; <hi>And when the man was let down and touched the bones of Eliſha, he revived and ſtood upon his feet, 2 Kings</hi> 13. 21.

                           <p>And thoſe men who are ſo ready to depart from our <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for every petty diſlike of the high Prieſts and Elders in it (though the diſlikes be rather phanſied then found,) do ſhew that they are not ſo well inſtructed in the faith as to know the promiſe of the Father, or not ſo well grounded in hope and rooted in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as to wait for that promiſe according to the appointment of the Son: He bids all tarry in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that look after his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and therefore doth not allow any to call <hi>Jeruſalem Babel,</hi> much leſs to make it ſo, that either themſelves or others may have a pretence to go out of it.</p>
                           <p>But what was this particular promiſe of the Father to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? it was the promiſe of ſending the Holy-Ghoſt to enable them to be his wtneſſes unto the uttermoſt parts of the Earth.</p>
                           <p>A promiſe which much concerns carnal men to look after, that they may have the ſpirit of God; A promiſe which much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns ſpiritual men, that they may have him more: Both muſt tarry in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> in the unity of the Church; for the mercy is not without the promiſe, and the promiſe is not without <hi>Jeruſalem: Depart not from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>but wait for the promiſe of the father;</hi> till therefore the carnal man ſhall need no ſpirit who hath none at all, and till the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man ſhall need no more ſpirit who cannot have too much, both muſt pray for the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> labour for the peace of the Church, in their prayers and in their practiſes, neither may recede from the Apoſtles nor from their Succeſſors, to whom was made the promiſe of the Holy-Ghoſt: And it is worth our notice, that though the Apoſtles had fourty dayes converſation with Chriſt, and were fully inſtructed in the knowledge of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, yet they did not preſently go and preach the Goſpel;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:114933:131"/>
Nay Chriſt himſelf bad them not go till they had received Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion from the Holy Ghoſt: So that there are two things required to conſtitute a true Preacher of the Goſpel; Ability, and Authority; or, Miſsion, and Commiſsion: He muſt firſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to preach, by converſing with Chriſt in his holy Word: Then beſides his Ability, he muſt alſo have Authority or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Holy Ghoſt, though not immediately by an extraordinary, yet mediately by an ordinary calling, or he hath not leave from Chriſt to preach the Goſpel: For ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Acts 1. 8. But ye ſhall receive power after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you, and ye ſhall be witneſſes unto me:</hi> Without this coming of the Holy Ghoſt men may be witneſſes to themſelves, but they cannot be witneſſes unto Chriſt, becauſe he hath not enabled or not authorized them: For which cauſe it is, that in the Ordination of a Miniſter, the Biſhop pronounceth thoſe words of our Saviour, (the firſt Biſhop that ever pronounced them) <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> thereby giving him a Commiſſion to be one of Chriſts witneſſes unto the people: For this promiſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized with the holy Ghoſt, to be Chriſts witneſſes, did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly belong to the Apoſtles, not as members, but only as mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſts Church: thoſe words he ſpake to them only as his Miniſters, though other words he ſpake to them as his Members.</p>

                              <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt</hi>] are words both of conſecration and of benediction; words of conſecration, as they ſet a man apart for Gods ſervice; words of benediction, as they enable and authorize a man to ſerve him: if not as a member, yet doubtleſs as a miniſter: if not by <hi>Gratia gratum faciens,</hi> yet by <hi>Gratia gratis data</hi> (as the School diſtinguiſheth) if not by gifts and graces that tend to his own regeneration, yet ſurely by gifts and graces that tend to others edification: And as it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day and hallowed it;</hi> ſo we may ſay, The Lord bleſſed his Apoſtles and hallowed them: for his hallowing was and is a bleſſing: And as our Saviour Chriſt is ſaid to have bleſſed the bread and the wine, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated them to be his own body and blood: So he alſo bleſſed the Apoſtles when he conſecrated them to be his own peculiar ſervants, thereby ſhewing, That there cannot be a greater bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then to ſerve him. And accordingly we muſt look on thoſe words whereby he conſecrated his Apoſtles, as words of

his words are words of Majeſty, able to bow down the higheſt heavens; and words of Verity, able to quicken the dulleſt earth: Such are the words of God in themſelves; but to us (bleſſed be his condeſcention and goodneſs) they are the words of Grace, Mercy and Peace: The words of Grace by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, of Mercy by promiſing, of Peace by bleſsing: And this word of bleſsing is ſo much his delight, that he choſe it for his very laſt word here on earth; and <hi>whiles he was ſpeaking this word, he was parted from them, and carried up to heaven, Luke</hi> 24. 51.

curſings: And though this ſin be now the common road of men upon earth, who blazen their own righteouſneſs chiefly by others pretended ſins, yet it can never be the right way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And we muſt forſake it, as we will ſtick to our calling, and to our inheritance; <hi>knowing that we are thereunto called, that we ſhould inherit a bleſſing:</hi> So that if we part not with this ſin of rayling, it will either part us from our calling, or part both us and our calling from our inheritance: it will either make us to be no Chriſtians, or ſuch Chriſtians as not to inherit a bleſſing: But what was this bleſsing, which our Saviour at parting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon his Apoſtles?

If ever Tradition will help out the Text, let it be now, that we may not loſe our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours <hi>laſt word</hi> and his <hi>beſt word</hi> both together: But Tradition cannot help us; and ſure we are from the Text, That our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our never taught his Apoſtles to join themſelves in Commiſsion with his Father, (creatures with their Creator) either to bleſs or curſe, although not only they, but alſo their Succeſſors can rightly do both in his name, and by his power. We have here only a probable conjecture, That the benediction which Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles, was the ſame in effect which the Apoſtles afterwards gave unto the Church in his name, as having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it from his own mouth; <hi>Grace unto you and peace be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter: Grace be with you, mercy and peace,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>John:</hi> It ſeems grace and mercy were reſerved till Chriſts aſcention; for we find only <hi>Peace be unto you,</hi> after his Reſurrection; and Saint <hi>John</hi> hints a reaſon of it; <hi>for the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe Jeſus was not yet glorified, John</hi> 7. 39. upon which ground we may not unreaſonably build this Poſition, That <hi>Grace and mercy were reſerved for Benedictions after his Aſcention, or till the giving of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

which Chriſt left to his Apoſtles when he parted from them: we ſhall do well to lay hold on that which we are ſure came from his own mouth whiles he was yet with them, even that recorded, <hi>Luke 11. 28.

Whence we may ſafely conclude not as Jews but as Chriſtians, that tis not ſafe but ſinfull meerly out of peeviſhneſs or willfullneſs to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the appointed ſeaſons of ſerving God; for ſuch a grievous
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:114933:139"/>
puniſhment as being cut off from Gods people, would not be threatned but for a grieveous ſin, ſuch as begins in the contempt of God, and ends in the ſcandal of men: Therefore duties are to be moſt ſtrictly obſerved upon their own dayes: Thus the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is moſt ſolemnly to be celebrated on its own day, the firſt day of the week: and the Aſcention on its own day, the fift day of the week; for the fourtieth day after a Sunday, can be no other then thirsday: So that either the fourtieth day after the reſurrection of Chriſt is lawfully conſecrated to celebrate his aſcention (and by conſequent is the day appointed for that duty) or this particular circumſtance was unneceſſarily ſet down in the text, and as unlawfully obſerved by the Apoſtles, who turning from the mount <hi>Olivet</hi> came into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and went up into their upper room, (when they durſt not aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Temple) and prayed there immediately upon their return, even on the very ſame day of Chriſts Aſcenſion, and did not think fit to put off their ſolemn meeting till the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or till the next Lords day after it.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore it is reaſonably concluded by Judicious men, that Apoſtolical practice is to us Chriſtians, what Moſaical precept was to the Jews, concerning the obſervation of dayes, places and perſons for religious aſſemblies; and therefore our Lords day is as indiſpenſable as was their Sabbath; our Churches as invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable as their Temple and Synagogues, our orders of Miniſters as unchangeable as their orders of Prieſts: for Apoſtolical Practice, in theſe circumſtances, or adjuncts of Religion, doth oblige us Chriſtians to conformity, as Moſaical precept, did the Jewes to <hi>obedience:</hi> (I ſay <hi>Comformity,</hi> becauſe time, place &amp; perſon were all eſſential parts of their ceremonial (and typical) but cannot be ſo of our moral worſhip; and therefore obedience was neceſſary for them, but comformity is enough for us) So that a willfull neglect, and much more a ſcornfull contempt of any rite obſerved by the Apoſtles, cannot but be impious in it ſelf, dangerous to us, and ſcandalous to our brethren; And as this is judiciouſly concluded by ſome learned men, ſo it muſt be couragiouſly reſolved by all good men, not to fear ſuperſtition in that which the Apoſtles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, when their practice is declared in the text, ſince all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances &amp; adjuncts of Religion are derived to us Chriſtians, rather by <hi>practice</hi> then by <hi>precept,</hi> as not being of the Subſtance of our
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:114933:140"/>
Religion; And indeed they could not well be derived otherwiſe, becauſe types and ceremonies were utterly to be aboliſhed to the Jews: and therefore ceremonies, though without types, could not but with offence to the Jews, be particularly preſcribed to the Chriſtians, &amp; conſequently were to be left unto them only in <hi>example and practice,</hi> as matter of decency and order, which are capable of diſpenſation: not ſet down in the text by way of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or impoſition,</hi> as matter of Subſtance, which hath alwayes a rigour of Juſtice, and ſhould alwayes have a readineſs of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, both alike <hi>indiſpenſable:</hi> Nay yet more, Apoſtolical practice recorded in the Text, was therefore imbraced by the Catholike Church, as if it had been Precept, for the time, and place, and perſons of Religious worſhip, becauſe that Practice in all theſe reſpects was founded upon the precepts of the old Teſtament, not as they were typical and figurative, but as they were ſolemn and poſitive, and did no leſs concern the Chriſtian in the publike exerciſe of his <hi>moral,</hi> then they did concern the Jew in the publike exerciſe of his <hi>ceremonial</hi> Worſhip.</p>
                           <p>For publike worſhip requires the ſame publike adjuncts of time, place, and perſon no leſs in the Chriſtians, then it did in the Jews Religion; And therefore we cannot deny but all thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in the old Teſtament that were given about thoſe publike adjuncts, do ſtill remain in force as to that intent <hi>of the publike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Religion,</hi> unleſs we will deny that Chriſtians are obliged to the exerciſe of Gods publike worſhip; we muſt then ſtill have our ſet dayes, (as Sabbaths:) our ſet places, (as Churches:) our ſet Perſons, (as Miniſters,) for the ſolemn publike worſhip of God: And conſequently they who go about to aboliſh any of theſe adjuncts, or circumſtances of publike worſhip, do in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect go about to expunge the fourth commandment out of the Decalogue, which was written with Gods own finger as well as the reſt, &amp; commandeth the ſolemn benediction, &amp; conſecration, and conſervation of all thoſe adjuncts of time, place &amp; perſon, as conducing to the Publike ſervice of God, and exerciſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And as for times and perſons, they have been ſince in many reſpects determined by Apoſtolical Practice, and particularly the Day of our Saviours Aſcenſion ſeems to have been An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually obſerved by them, as the day of his Reſurrection was
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:114933:140"/>
obſerved weekly, ſince we find that Feſtival univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Catholike Church, and the Fathers made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny admirable Sermons or Homilies upon it long before ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition had infected, or Popery had invaded the Church of Chriſt; in ſo much as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tells us plainly, <hi>that the feaſt of the Aſcenſion was obſerved in the Catholike Church, even from the Apoſtles times.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Sure we are, thoſe primitive Chriſtians well underſtood that God did not intend to confine, but to enlarge his own worſhip by the fourth Commandment; to wit, to make that exerciſe of Religion ſolemn and publike in the fourth, which was private in the other three Commandments; not to make that to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on one day, which was before commanded to be all the week. For he that ſaith Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, ſuppoſeth, that as no day thou canſt be without thy heart, ſo no day thy heart may be without his love; And therefore when we have a publike day ſet apart to make this our love publikely known, if we do wilfully neglect the ſame, we are grievous tranſgreſſors and downright plain Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers, though not on the Sabbath day; and conſequently twice ſinners in one contempt or profanation, for omitting the ſubſtance of the duty, and for contemning the circumſtance of the day.</p>
                           <p>Another circumſtance in our bleſſed Saviours Aſcenſion, is, the place from which he was received up, and that was not <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eruſalem,</hi> but <hi>Bethany:</hi> For although the Apoſtles had been with him in <hi>Galilee</hi> many dayes, (where he converſed with them after the firſt day of his Reſurrection,) yet now they were again returned back to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> waiting there for the promiſe of the Father, as they had been commanded, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 4. And he led them out from thence as far as <hi>Bethany (Luk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> 24. 50.) before he was pleaſed to aſcend into heaven, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he would not have the people ſee, but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Myſterie of his Aſcenſion; and partly becauſe he would not expoſe his Apoſtles to the outrages of thoſe, who though they had ſeen it, yet were reſolved not to believe, but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the true believers: And yet in that he led his Apoſtles out to <hi>Bethany,</hi> he ſhewed them what was the right uſe they were to make of this worlds afflictions or perſecutions, even
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:114933:141"/>
to have their converſation with him in heaven: For <hi>Bethany</hi> is by interpretation the houſe of ſorrow or affliction; and our bleſſed Saviour Aſcending to heaven from thence, hath ſhewed us that then do we make a right uſe of of our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on earth, when they do make our ſouls aſcend up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: This is to turn <hi>Bethany</hi> into <hi>Bethel,</hi> the houſe of ſorrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of God.</p>
                           <p>But the place from which our bleſſed Saviour aſcended into heaven, is called Mount <hi>Olivet, Act.</hi> 1. 12. And indeed theſe two were but one and the ſame place; for <hi>Bethany</hi> ſtood upon Mount <hi>Olivet:</hi> Chriſt aſcended from a Mount, and from this Mount <hi>Olivet:</hi> He aſcended from a Mount, to ſhew it was not an eaſie ſtep from earth to heaven; there muſt be three ladders joyned together to accompliſh this aſcent, <hi>ſcala mentis, ſcala vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis, ſcala vitae;</hi> one ladder of the mind by contemplation; another ladder of the will by affection; a third ladder of the life by action: All three have ſeveral rongs or degrees, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder had, and God is only at the <hi>top:</hi> Again, he aſcended from this Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> where he begun his paſſion by ſweating blood, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 22.) to ſhew us the neceſſity of paſſive obedience if we deſire to go to heaven; <hi>Moſes</hi> his Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> which teacheth the rule of active obedience, will not ſerve the turn; we muſt alſo go up to Chriſts Mount <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,</hi> and there learn his paſſive obedience, that by ſuffering with him, we may alſo reign with him; for he <hi>humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs, and therefore God highly exalted him, Phil.</hi> 2. Can you drink of his cup, without fear it may overcome your weak Stomack, ſince the fear of it made him <hi>offer up prayers and ſupplications with ſtrong crying and tears, (Heb.</hi> 5. 7.)

Men; yet men only, not Angels, appointed by him as witneſſes of his aſcenſion; though not all men: And that the diſturbers of theſe witneſſes, (that is, of the orders of Chriſts Miniſters in his Church,) do ſin againſt this article of Chriſts aſcenſion, which however is it ſelf, and puts all true believers above all diſturbances.</head>
                           <p>THE perſons before whom, or in whoſe preſence our bleſſed Saviour was received up into heaven, will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us ſeveral conſiderations; for they were of two different kinds; Angels, and men; The one were Citizens of heaven in their Pilgrimage to earth; the other were inhabitants of earth in their Pilgrimage to heaven: He was taken up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome Angels that were newly come down from heaven; and before ſome men, that were in their journey thither; none is accounted by him a fit witneſs of his aſcenſion into heaven, but ſuch a one as is already there, either by the excellency of his condition, or by the purity of his affection; either an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, or an Apoſtle: The Angels are mentioned, <hi>Act. 1. 10. Behold two men ſtood by them in white apparel;</hi> that is, Two Angels in the ſhape and appearance of men: They had been witneſſes of his humiliation to their aſtoniſhment, and were now of his exaltation to their joy; He is going up, and they are coming down; He ſeems to carry away Heaven from his Apoſtles, they ſeem to bring it back again: God never leaves his ſervants deſtitute of all comfort; If not Chriſt, yet an Angel is ſtill with them, till at laſt comes the Comforter himſelf: Nor did our bleſſed Saviour account a bare promiſe of the Comforter to be enough, but here he alſo gives a pledge of that promiſe: Thoſe Miniſtring ſpirits being as it were ſo many harbingers ſent before hand to be ſpeak and provide lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:114933:142"/>
for God the Holy-Ghoſt againſt his comming, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſureties or pledges, that he would now very ſhortly come. Yet our bleſſed Saviour appointed not Angels for witneſſes of his aſcenſion to the world, leſt the Divels (which can tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves into Angels of light) might alſo have been witneſſes of the ſame without his appointment, not to the confirmation, but the utter depravation and ſubverſion of the true Chriſtian Faith; Therefore hath God flatly bound us up to be guided and governed only by thoſe things which his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles have preached unto us, that our faith ſhould be wholly grounded and fixed upon certainties, ſo that <hi>though an Angel from heaven ſhould preach any other Goſpel,</hi> we ſhould not hear him but curſe him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. But <hi>Aquinas (in</hi> 3. 64, 7.) upon this queſtion, <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trum Angeli poſſint Sacramenta Miniſtrare, whether Angels may adminiſter the Sacraments,</hi> concludes they may not, upon ſuch demonſtrative reaſons, which will alſo prove that they may not preach the Goſpel; one of his reaſons is this, <hi>Tota virtus Sacramentorum à paſſione Chriſti derivatur, cui in naturâ conformantur homines, non autem Angeli; &amp; ideo ad homines pertinet diſpenſare Sacramenta, non autem ad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos; All the vertue of the Sacraments, is derived from the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, who took not on him the nature of Angels, but of man, and therefore it belongs to men, not to Angels, to be the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Sacraments:</hi> We may ſay the ſame concerning the word, (for the Word and Sacraments were both ordained by the ſame Author, and for the ſame end, and are both under the ſame truſt,) That Chriſt became man to the intent that he might him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf preach the Goſpel, and therefore would nor make uſe of any but of men to preach it after him: That like as the Son of God had priviledged the nature of man, not of Angels, by taking it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Unity of his perſon; ſo he might priviledge the perſons of men, not of Angels, by taking them into the ſociety of his office.</p>
                           <p>The other of his reaſons is indeed above all reaſon, becauſe it is founded upon Gods Authority, and therefore ſerves him for an Argument to be oppoſed againſt all the contrary obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; <hi>Sed contra eſt, quod dicitur,</hi> Heb. 5. <hi>Omnis pontifex ex hominibus aſſumptus, pro hominibus conſtituitur in his que ſunt ad Deum; ſed Angeli (boni vel mali) non ſunt ex homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus; ergo ipſi non conſtituuntur miniſtri in his quae ſunt ad Deum,</hi>

1. <hi>in Sacramentis.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That every high Prieſt is taken from men, and is ordained for men in things pertaining to God; but Angels are not taken from men;</hi> Therefore they <hi>are not ordained Miniſters for men, in things pertaining to God,</hi> &amp; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the word and Sacraments are things pertaining to God; the argument concerns the whole diſcharge of a Prieſts office, That an Angel may diſcharge no part of it; For the Apoſtles intent is to clear the Prieſt-hood of Chriſt againſt all objections of the Jews; and accordingly he proves out of their own Law that God had abſolutely circumſcribed and limited the Prieſt-hood, in three reſpects. 1. In regard of the perſon of the Prieſt, for that none could be a Prieſt who was not a man, becauſe none elſe was fit to intercede for men; none elſe would have compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of men. 2. In regard of the office of the Prieſthood, which was to reconcile the ſinners, and expiate the ſin. 3. In regard of the outward calling to that office, for no man might take that honour to himſelf, but he that was called of God as was <hi>Aaron.</hi> Accordingly our Saviour Chriſt was pleaſed to be made man, that he might be capable of being our high Prieſt, to intercede for us and to have compaſsion on us: And he did actually undertake this office of the Prieſt-hood, in reconciling ſinners and in expiating ſin; nor did he undertake this office without being thereunto called of God, as was <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>From this Argument we may deduce theſe two concluſions.</p>
                           <p>1. That Angels cannot be Prieſts, nor diſcharge thoſe duties which belong only to Prieſts, as Preaching the word, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacraments, becauſe they are not men: and every Prieſt is to be taken from among men.</p>
                           <p>2. That all men may not be Prieſts, to diſcharge theſe ſame duties, but only thoſe who are called of God as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> that is, who are ſet apart by an outward calling for that diſcharge; And they that are not ſo called, and yet will needs be either Preaching the Goſpel, or Miniſtring the Sacraments, do affront our Saviour Chriſt in his Prieſt-hood, oppoſing him in his office, rejecting him in his example, and contemning him in his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: For as an Angel may not do the office of a Prieſt, <hi>propter impedimentum perſonae,</hi> for the impediment of his perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not a man, not <hi>taken from among men;</hi> So that man who is not called of God as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> may not do the office
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:114933:143"/>
of a Prieſt, <hi>propter impedimentum cauſae,</hi> for the impediment of the cauſe or office it ſelf, becauſe he is not <hi>ordained for men in things pertaining to God;</hi> and unleſs God ordain him, ſure God will not accept him: Let him meddle only with things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to men, let him not meddle with things pertaining to God: For he that ſtruck <hi>

To affront Chriſt in his Prieſt-hood, whereby he reconciled man to God, is the ready way to loſe the benefit of that reconciliation: He will not have his Prieſtly office invaded by Angels, much leſs will he have it invaded by men; He will not let Angels preach his Goſpel, leaſt their preaching ſhould beget uncertainties, whiles the Devils might come and preach among them; And much leſs will he have men that are <hi>not called of God</hi> to preach his Goſpel, becauſe their preaching can beget nothing but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, whiles the Devils may come and preach in them: He will have no other witneſſes of his truth, but ſuch as are of his own choice: For thus he declared his own will, (and hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince reverſed that declaration) <hi>Acts 10. 40, 41. Him God raiſed up the third day, and ſhewed him openly, not to all the people, but unto witneſſes choſen before of God:</hi> He would then have his choice and ſelect witneſſes, and would not entruſt his Sacred Myſteries with all in common, leaſt they ſhould be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected of all; But he choſe ſuch men for his witneſſes as ſhould rather lay down their lives, then the profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith: And we cannot reaſonably deny, but that he ſtill hath his

choice witneſſes, whom he hath entruſted with his truth, whom he hath enabled to diſcharge that truſt, &amp; whom he will call to a ſtrict account for not diſcharging it: ſo that we muſt ſay, God is ſtill pleaſed to ſhew his Son openly as he did then, <hi>not to all the people, but only to ſome choſen witneſſes.</hi> And he will have the people ſtill to depend upon thoſe witneſſes to be inſtructed and informed in the Sacred truths concerning his Son, or in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Chriſtian Religion: And the gadding humour which now poſſeſſeth the people, to run from Gods witneſſes, is the ready way for them to fall into all kinds of <hi>falſe Doctrine and hereſie,</hi> and that will in a ſhort time bring them to <hi>hardneſs of heart, and contempt of Gods word and commandments,</hi> eſpecially ſince they are not now taught to pray againſt it, but rather to expell and revile ſuch heavenly prayers: And thus we plainly ſee, that the more Chriſts Miniſters have of late been hindred from being the witneſſes of his ſaving Truth, the more they have been forced to be the witneſſes of this ſad Truth, <hi>even of the encreaſing of Hereſies and hardneſſes in his people:</hi> And though they may be denyed to be Chriſts witneſſes to the people for their converſion, yet they cannot be denyed to be his witneſſes againſt the people for their condemnation: Jeſu God, what an infinite miſery is it for thy Miniſters to be ſuch witneſſes! and yet infinitely more miſerable are thy people, in that thy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt bear thee ſuch witneſs.

                           <p>Tis true that his firſt witneſſes <hi>forſook him and fled, Mar.</hi> 14. 50. and one of them alſo denyed him, yet after his reſurrection he neither upbraids the one nor the other, as if they had been <hi>ſcandalous Miniſters,</hi> but pitties their infirmities, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and confirms them in their Miniſtry.</p>

The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is unſound, and ſo is the ſuperſtruction; But we are ſure, whatever the Diſciples frailty was in our Saviours Paſſion, yet their zeal and conſtancy were both very eminent after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: For then they attended diligently and conſtantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their maſter, till they ſaw him taken up from them, and they loſt nothing by their diligent and their conſtant attendance: For his <hi>Valediction</hi> was a <hi>Benediction,</hi> as he left them, he bleſſed them: A good example for us how we ought to leave this world, though never ſo injurious to us, never ſo oppreſſive of us: for a Benediction is the only true Chriſtian Valediction: and there is no aſcending into heaven without that: They who part, and go away hence in diſcontents and grudgings, (which are but ſecret curſes of the heart, againſt God or man) can ſcarce go to heaven by Chriſts aſsiſtance, becauſe they deſire not to go thither after his example. But let their names be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in the records of eternity, who notwithſtanding all the provocations and inſolencies of unjuſt and unrighteous men, have died with more patience and contentedneſs, then we dare live: Sure even they alſo did ſee Chriſt in his Aſcention, (though ſo many hundred years after it)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or they could not ſo exactly have followed his pattern: But whatever we may think or ſay of them, ſure we cannot deny but ſome others did ſee it full as many hundred years before; <hi>as Moſes, Deut. 33. 26.

                           <p>IT is not to be denyed but that our Saviour Chriſt, doth as he is a man, ſit at the right hand of God: For he doth ſit there in his humane nature, whether we take his ſitting at the right hand of God for his reſting in eternal bleſſedneſs, after all the travails and labours of his ſufferings, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth, (<hi>in Expoſ. Symb.</hi>) or for being aſſumed and aſſociated into the glory of the Divinity, as <hi>Damaſcen</hi> expounds it: For as in his Divine nature he ſate at the right hand of God from all eternity, being in the ſame power, and glory, and bleſſedneſs with him; ſo alſo after his aſcenſion he carried up his humane nature to ſit there, having taken the nature of man as into the unity, ſo alſo into the glory and bleſſedneſs of his perſon, and in it adminiſtring the Kingdom of his father, as head of the Church both Militant and Triumphant, King of Saints, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of all things in heaven and in earth. For ſo himſelf hath told us, <hi>Mat. 28. 18. All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth; Go therefore and teach all nations, baptizng them;</hi> (or rather, Go therefore and Diſciple all nations, baptizing them, that is, make them my Diſciples by baptizing them in the name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereby diſtinguiſhing them from thoſe who are not my Diſciples, even by Baptiſm) Here is ſuch a commiſſion for the Miniſter to execute his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, (both for Word and Sacraments;) as all the Magiſtrates in the world can neither give nor take away: For they have a power only from Chriſts power in earth: but this calling of the Miniſtry is founded upon the power of Chriſt which he hath alſo in heaven.</p>
                           <p>And they who make it their buſineſs to diſcountenance and oppoſe the Miniſters of the Goſpel, whilſt they preach, and pray, and adminiſter the Sacraments according to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and command of their Maſter, do but in effect ſtrive to juſtle Chriſt out of the heads and hearts of men, and to thruſt him away from the right hand of God: Surely he that hopes
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:114933:148"/>
to be ſet one day at the right hand of Chriſt, will now willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge, and reverently adore Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of God; And they who do not willingly now put themſelves under his power, ſhall at laſt be brought under it againſt their will; for <hi>he muſt reign till he hath put all his enemies under his feet;</hi> and though he ſhall ſtill reign after that, (<hi>for his Kingdom ſhall have no end, as being an everlaſting Kingdom, 2 Pet.</hi> 1, 11.) yet he ſhall not, after that, exerciſe his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſo viſibly by the cooperation of his humane nature as now he doth, but only by the eſſential power and preſence of his Godhead, in which reſpect it is ſaid, <hi>And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 28.

end, unleſs it could be proved, that not only Chriſt, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the bleſſed Virgin doth indeed ſit at the right hand of God, being joyned with Chriſt in the government of his Kingdom: which is altogether impoſſible, for that Chriſt himſelf ſits there in his humane nature, only by vertue of the perſonal union to, and with the eternal Son of God, whoſe property alone it is to ſit at the right hand of his Father: For though the Holy Ghoſt be alſo equal with the Father in the ſame power and glory, (and therefore together with the Father and the Son is worſhipped and glorified) yet he is not ſaid to ſit at his right hand; thats a phraſe ſpoken peculiarly of the Son, in whom the Divine nature was as it were ecclipſed for a while in the ſtate of his humiliation; and in whom the humane nature now ſhineth moſt gloriouſly in the ſtate of exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                           <p>And beſides, for that the Son alone doth adminiſter the Kingdom of the Father immediately from the Father, but the Holy Ghoſt adminiſtreth the ſame Kingdom, not only from the Father, but alſo from the Son: For although God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt do equally govern the Church both militant and triumphant, that is, do equally adminiſter one and the ſame Kingdom in heaven and earth, yet the Father adminiſtreth it of himſelf, not by himſelf; for he is of none, as in being, ſo in working.

So that our bleſſed Saviour did adminiſter the Kingdom of his Father from all eternity as God: But now, ſince his Aſcenſion, he doth alſo adminiſter the ſame as <hi>God in man,</hi> or <hi>as God manifeſt in the fleſh:</hi> And it is his property alone to ſit at the right hand

                              <hi>Laus Deo</hi> will reflect directly on him, no leſs then on the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, for the bleſſed adminiſtration of his Kingdom, but <hi>Virginique Matri Mariae</hi> may ſecurely be left out, and is blaſphemouſly and idolatrouſly put in, ſince the bleſſed Virgin her ſelf muſt needs think it robbery to be equal with her Son, when her Son thinks it no robbery, to be equal with God. And certainly if the Fathers in the firſt Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> thought it enough to prove the Holy Ghoſt coequal with the Father and the Son, by ſaying, <hi>Who with the Father and the Son together is worſhipped and glorified,</hi> Then we cannot but think it too much that the bleſſed Virgin is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and glorified with all three perſons of the Trinity, as if ſhe were to be thought coequal with Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; But perchance <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was reſolved to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the preſent practiſe of his Church, with a doxology anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that <hi>Antiphona, Gaude Maria Virgo, cunctas haereſes ſola interemiſti in univerſo mundo; Rejoyce O Virgin Mary, thou alone haſt taken away all hereſies in the univerſal world;</hi> And he having made it his work to confute all for hereticks who were not of his own gan, gives thanks to the bleſſed Virgin, as if by her help he had perfected this great confutation; whereas without doubt it is no more in the power of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to take away a hereſie, then it is to change the heart or will of the heritick: nor is it in the power of all the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> in the world to prove us poor proteſtants guilty of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, becauſe we dare not be guilty of blaſphemy, nor of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. For it is blaſphemy to aſcribe that perfection, and it is Idolatry to give that honour to the creature which is proper only to the Creator: And tis a wonder that <hi>Baronius</hi> who is pleaſed to ſay that our Church of England is wholly drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hereſie, would not impute the cauſe of that miſcheif, to our rejecting this and the like Hymns or prayers to the bleſſed Virgin, and ſay, ſhe would not take away our hereſies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we had taken away her worſhip: for this reaſon had certainly been more ingenuous, (in one of that perſwaſion,) then to tell us that we were therefore given over to our delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, becauſe we denyed to pay the <hi>Peter</hi> pence: For that

aſcended into heaven; ſhew me a glory like to the glory of the Chriſtian Religion, which hath him alone for its author, for its head, who ſitteth on the right hand of God: Ask the Jew, he will tell you he left his Prophet upon Mount <hi>Nebo;</hi> Ask the Turk, he will tell you his Pcophet was left at <hi>Meca;</hi> Ask other Religions, they will tell you they know not what is become of their Prophets: It is only the Chriſtian Religion that can ſay, it had ſuch a Prophet as now ſitteth at the right hand of God. A Prophet who taught not a religion without righteouſneſs, as is the Religion of Turks and Heathens; nor a Religion with Righteouſneſs, but which could not make men righteous, as was the Religion of the Jews; But a <hi>Religion with Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> to ſhew it ſelf righteous, and a <hi>righteouſneſs with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> to make us <hi>ſo. For the law</hi> (which was the rule of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs) <hi>came by Moſes, but grace</hi> (which maketh righteous) <hi>came only by Jeſus Chriſt, John</hi> 1. 17. By this, He ſtill dwelleth in us, even now that he is fartheſt from us: which is ſo invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a bleſſing that it cannot be valued till it be enjoyed, and when it is enjoyed, it is found invaluable: For the ſoul of man cannot but have a wretched dwelling in the body, and a more wretched dwelling out of it, unleſs Chriſt have a dwelling in the ſoul: It is the glory of men above Angels that Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in their fleſh: It is the glory of good Chriſtians above other men, that Chriſt dwelleth in their ſpirits: By his grace he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with us and in us, by our faith and love we dwell with him &amp; in him; nor ſhall this dwelling ever be deſtroyed, it ſhall only be enlarged, when what is now of grace, ſhall hereafter be of glory.</p>
                           <p>There is ſo inſeparable an union betwixt Chriſt and the good Chriſtian, that as the Chriſtian cannot be in the ſtate of Grace without Chriſt, ſo Chriſt not fully in the ſtate of glory without him. The head thinks himſelf not in honour, whiles the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are in diſhonour, and therefore our head being aſcended into heaven, makes it his work to draw us (the members of his myſtical body) thither after him; For we are united unto Chriſt by a threefold cord, that is not eaſily broken: Firſt by the tie of Election, <hi>God having choſen us in him before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, having predeſtinated us to the adoption of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will, Eph.</hi> 1. 4, 5. Secondly by the tie of incarnation,

wherein he took our fleſh unto himſelf.

He looks on them not only as having <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> but alſo as having <hi>jus in re;</hi> not only as claiming, but alſo as poſſeſſing their heavenly inheritance. O that we would be ſo careful, or could be ſo happy, as not to abuſe thoſe mercies which we cannot deſerve! O that we would lift up our ſouls truly and entirely unto the Lord, then would our hearts be where our treaſure is, <hi>at the right hand of God:</hi> For we may not be in heaven by our perſwaſions, whiles we are either in earth by our affections, or in hell by our diſpoſitions: How can we ſee our Saviour at Gods right hand, whiles Satan ſtands at ours? making us to butcher his ſervants, to deface his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to diſcountenance his Religion, to defile or deſpiſe his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, to deceive his people, to deſtroy his inheritance? How can we believe him to be making interceſſion for us, whiles we care not to make interceſſion for our ſelves? or at leaſt wiſe, uſe ſuch extravagant prayers wherein we cannot juſtly expect, much leſs judiciouſly hope he ſhould make interceſsion with us? Be it the priviledge of faith to have an eye to be able to ſee Chriſt; but of <hi>devotion</hi> to keep that eye alwaies open, actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to behold and look upon him, for which cauſe ſome have thought that prayer was the proper act of juſtifying faith, men then moſt eſpecially believing in Chriſt, when they are praying to him: So that to oppoſe or diſturb the exerciſe of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded and well-ſettled devotions, under pretence of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, is to put out the eye of faith whiles we pretend to take off the film, that it may ſee the clearer. For the precious talent of faith, muſt neither be wrapped up in a Napkin, nor indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly managed, if we expect it ſhould enrich our ſouls with heavenly and immortal comforts; but muſt be diligently and diſcreetly imployed in judicious, as well as in fervent pravers and praiſes to Almighty God, that ſo we may <hi>fight the good fight of faith,</hi> by defending and maintaining not only the truth of the

So here the inference is unqueſtionable; If there were a time of warfare, of baniſhment, of captivity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pardon, there muſt needs be a time of peace, of reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liberty after it; If that were a time of expulſion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection whiles we were enemies; this is a time of acceptance or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion now we are Sons, as ſaith Sant <hi>Paul, behold now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of Salvation, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
                           <p>That was a day of damnation, this is a day of ſalvation: that a a time not accepted, this a time accepted: The time of the fleſh, and the time of the Spirit: the time of ſin, and the time of Grace, are two oppoſite times: the time that ſin reigns in us, is a time of warfare, baniſhment, and captivity; the time that the Spirit of Grace reigns in us, is a time of reſtitution and of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt a time of peace,</hi> and that <hi>a peace of heart,</hi> John 14. 27. <hi>My peace I give unto you, let not your heart be troubled,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:114933:154"/>
neither let it be afraid.</hi> The peace that Chriſt gives us, is a peace of heart; a Peace that puts away all trouble, and all fear; All trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble leaſt it ſhould diſturb our peace outwardly; and all fear leaſt it ſhould diſturb our peace inwardly; which is the invincible reaſon Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> alledgeth to prove that the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are aſſured of their ſtate of bliſs, becauſe otherwiſe their fear would diſturb their peace, and conſequently interrupt their bleſſedneſs: And <hi>Aquinas</hi> affirms the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be no leſs ſure of the continuance of their bliſs then of the bliſs it ſelf, and therefore to be in ſome ſort partakers of the divine eternity, to which all is actually preſent, nothing to come, or elſe they could not have the full quietation of their wills, without which Bleſſedneſs it ſelf could be no bleſſedneſs, 22. <hi>q. 18. art.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>the time of Grace is a time of reſtitution,</hi> and that to our true Country, even to heaven: The Philoſopher could point thither with his finger, but the Chriſtian points thither with his heart. For <hi>that</hi> being once touched with the ſpirit of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes moves and beats towards heaven, as a needle touched with a loadſtone moves alwayes towards the Pole. For true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ſo full of hope, and their hope is ſo full of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that they are very well contented to reſign this mortal life when God ſhall require it, as thoſe who know themſelves to be but ſtrangers and ſo journers hereon earth, and that their Country, (where they are to expect a laſting &amp; a ſure dwelling) is only in heaven, as ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in their behalf, <hi>For we know that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God eternal in the heavens; wherefore in this we groan carneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from heaven, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2. This houſe of earth is but our tabernacle, that of heaven is our dwelling; In this we groan, in that we ſhall rejoice; This is to be diſſolved as built by man; thats a building of God, and therefore not capable of diſſolution.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>the time of Grace is a time of liberty,</hi> for Grace is the well-ſpring and fountain of liberty, as ſin is of thraldom; For as ſin is an averſion from God to ſerve our ſelves, which is the greateſt ſervitude, ſo Grace is a converſion to God to ſerve him; whoſe ſervice is perfect freedom; ſo that no man is ſo truly a ſlave
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:114933:155"/>
as he that ſerves himſelf, and none ſo truly free as he that ſerves his God; <hi>Nemo liber niſi ſapiens,</hi> None is a free man but he that is a wiſe man, may not be taken for a Paradox, if we be not miſtaken in the wiſdom, but think and ſay with the ſpirit of God, <hi>Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding, Job.</hi> 28. 28.

                           <p>If you ask how the baptized into Chriſt, put on Chriſt, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> will anſwer you with a diſtinction, <hi>Vel Sacramenti perceptione vel rei induunt homines aliquando Chriſtum uſque ad Sacramenti perceptionem; Aliquando autem ulterius, uſque ad vitae ſanctificationem, &amp; hoc accidit quum digne ſuſcipiunt.</hi> Men (when they are baptized) do put on Chriſt: Sometimes outwardly in the viſible ſign of the Sacrament, Sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the ſpiritual Grace of the thing ſignified (as when they worthily receive their Baptiſm) And this anſwer is neceſſary becauſe there are ſo many Hypocrites in the world who fruſtrate the Grace of God by their Hypocriſie; But concerning thoſe that are not Hypocrites when they come to be baptized, as true believers, or concerning thoſe who cannot be Hypocrites, as little children, the Judgement of charity bids us ſay, they have put on Chriſt both outwardly and inwardly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Judgement of verity teacheth us to ſay, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward viſible ſign is not without the inward ſpiritual grace on Gods part who offereth the Baptiſm, (and is not wanting to his own offers) what ever it be on mans part who receiveth it; for thoſe words of the Goſpel, <hi>He ſhall baptize you with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt and with fire (Mat.</hi> 3. 11.) will not allow us to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Holy-Ghoſt and the fire from the Baptiſm which hath been inſtituted by our Saviour Chriſt; But <hi>Bonaventure lib. 4.

So that in his ſenſe, All that have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt equally as to the reſtitution of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, though not as to the infuſion of grace. They are all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the innocency that was loſt in the firſt, though not all enriched with the grace that is found and founded in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam.</hi> They have not the ſin of their nature imputed, though they have it ſtill inherent: They have it not imputed, in that they are made the children of God; They have it inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, in that they are ſtill the ſons of men: Baptiſm is avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto all alike for Remiſſion of ſins, though not for Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration from ſin: And yet ſure it makes way for that too; elſe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would not have annexed the receiving the gift of the Holy Ghoſt to the remiſsion of ſins, ſaying, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, (Acts</hi> 2. 38.)

For ſurely Baptiſm of it ſelf without the Holy Ghoſt cannot avail to the remiſsion of ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore this promiſe of receiving the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, is to be expounded comparatively, that is, a greater gift of the Holy Ghoſt. And this expoſition is neceſſary from this very text, becauſe there is no remiſsion of ſin without grace, and no grace without the Spirit of grace; and may be proved to be convenient from that other Text which comes near to this, of <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 15, 16, 17. where after the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had been Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>John</hi> layed their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghoſt; that is to ſay, in a greater proportion for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, then they had in Baptiſm for their converſion.</p>

                              <pb n="272" facs="tcp:114933:157"/>But why is it ſaid, <hi>They were baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus?</hi> ſhall we think that the Apoſtles did recede from that form of Baptiſm, which had been given them by Chriſt himſelf? Saint <hi>Ambroſe (lib. 2. de Sacram. c.</hi> 7.) ſeems to affirm there is no need of that, when he ſaith, <hi>In uno nomine baptizari nos oportet, hoc eſt, in nomine Patris &amp; Filii &amp; Spiritus Sancti,</hi> &amp;c. We muſt be baptized in one name, that is, In the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, which is but one name, becauſe but one ſubſtance, but one Divinity, but one Majeſty; and ſaith moreover, that name is the name whereby we muſt be ſaved, which we are ſure is the name of the Lord Jeſus, (<hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12.) So that if we admit of this Gloſs, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing in the name of the Lord Jeſus, is all one with Baptizing in the name of the bleſſed Trinity, which being undivided in nature, cannot well be divided in name. But <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſeems to be of another opinion, (<hi>3a. par. qu. 66. art. 6. ad</hi> 1.) <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendum quod ex ſpeciali Chriſti revelatione, Apoſtoli in primitiva Eccleſia in nomine Chriſti baptizabant, ut nomen Chriſti (quod erat odioſum &amp; Judaeis &amp; Gentilibus) honorabile redderetur per hoc, quod ad ejus invocationem Spiritus Sanctus dabatur in baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo;</hi> We muſt ſay that the Apoſtles by ſome ſpecial revelation did for a while at firſt baptize only in the name of Chriſt, becauſe the name of Chriſt was odious both to Jews and Gentiles, and this was a way to make it honourable in the eſteem of both, when by the invocation of that name they ſaw the Holy Ghoſt given in Baptiſm; But this opinion may the better be deſerted, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the words upon which it is grounded, require it not. 2. Becauſe no ſuch ſpecial revelation can be proved: and it is not ſafe to allow of ſpecial hidden Revelations againſt the known general revelation of the Text. 3. Becauſe the Apoſtles by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing in the name of Chriſt, could glorifie him only amongſt unbelievers; whereas, in ſo doing, they might diſhonour him amongſt Believers, by receding from his Inſtitution. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Holy Ghoſt was not given in Baptiſm after ſo publick a manner, as to be taken notice of by ſtanders by. 5. Becauſe <hi>Aquinas</hi> himſelf is ſo poſitive for baptizing explicitly in the name of the Holy Trinity, that he avoweth there can be no true Baptiſm without it. For theſe and the like reaſons, it may happily not be amiſs to give another Interpretation of thoſe

words; then <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath given, (though not ſo exactly to the letter,) and to ſay, They were baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus, is all one in effect, as if it had been ſaid, That they were baptized by his Authority, and according to his inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or that they were baptized into his death and reſurrection, giving up themſelves wholly to him; or that they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with a ſpecial invocation of his name, not in the very act of baptizing, (for then was invocated the name of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) but before and after it, becauſe in Baptiſm was made a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial application of his merits unto them, for the remiſſion of ſins: This was the reaſon that the name of Chriſt was ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then invocated, becauſe the righeouſneſs of Chriſt was then ſpecially applyed, as appears by that advice of <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>Saul, Acts 22. 16. Ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the name of the Lord;</hi> that is, on the name of the Lord Chriſt, who inſtituted Baptiſm for the remiſſion of ſins, and was to be called upon, to bleſs his own inſtitution: So that to baptize in the name of the Lord Jeſus, may happily import no more then to baptize with a peculiar invocation of his name; not altering the form, but ſhewing the end of Baptiſm, which was to ingraft the baptized into the myſtical body of Chriſt; However this phraſe of <hi>being baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> doth clearly evince that Chriſt is peculiarly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in Baptiſm; for to ſuppoſe the name without the thing, is little leſs then to take the name in vain. And this is ground enough, why good Chriſtians ſhould deſire to have their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptized; and too much, why any ſhould delay, and (which is far worſe) deny the baptiſm of infants; for ſuch men do what they can to hinder Chriſt from being communicated to thoſe infants, to whom they deny baptiſm: wherefore as that promiſe which was made particularly to <hi>Joſhua, I will not leave thee nor forſake thee, Joſ.</hi> 1. 5. is applyed generally by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to all good Chriſtians, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. upon this ground that God is the ſame in all ages, to all that alike fear and ſerve him. So doth our Church, (after Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> example, and in his faith,) rightly infer, that the ſame good will which our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour declared by embracing and bleſsing thoſe little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which were brought to him, (<hi>Mar.</hi> 10.) belongs alike to all children born within the Covenant of grace: for God is <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

Alen. par. 1. qu. 73. m. 4. art.</hi> 2. To ſpeak properly concerning the miſſion (or communication) of the Son and Spirit of God, neither of them is communicated but only in ſome effect of ſaving grace, (though in general terms either may be ſaid to be communicated in the gift of any grace) For when they are communicated unto us, not only their gifts are ours, but alſo themſelves, to inhabit and to dwell in us, and to be in us more ſpecially or peculiarly then they were before; And why then ſhould not every Chriſtian take up Holy <hi>Davids</hi> moſt holy Reſolution, and ſay, <hi>I will not ſuffer mine eyes to ſleep, nor mine eye-lids to ſlumber, untill I find out a place, (even mine own ſoul) for the Temple of the Lord, and an Habitation for the mighty God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 4, 5. For indeed the Lord and the mighty God, Chriſt and his Spirit are communicated both together, according to that of <hi>John 6. 53. Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you:</hi> As there is a communication and diſtribution of the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to the body, that it may live; ſo is there of Chriſt to the ſoul, or it cannot live: And he is communicated by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: For no man can eat his fleſh nor drink his blood who is at the right hand of God, by corporal, but only by ſpiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation; and there can be no ſpiritual eating of Chriſt, but by the aſſiſtance of his Spirit: So that Chriſt and the Spirit of Chriſt, are communicated to us both together, and we have alike need of both: For as Chriſt is our Advocate to bring us to the Father, ſo is the Holy Ghoſt our Advocate to bring us unto Chriſt: And as Chriſt revealed to us the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo doth the holy Spirit reveal to us the will of Chriſt, making us, in the right uſe of his Word and Sacraments, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtruction from him, to enjoy communion with him,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:114933:159"/>
and to find immortal joy and comfort in him: This is that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, when he ſaith, <hi>For ye have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father, Rom.</hi> 8. 15. The Apoſtle would have us Chriſtians ſee the happineſs of our own condition above the Jews, that we might accordingly ſhew our thankfulneſs above them. For they being under the terrours of the Law, could not but have the Spirit of bondage, becauſe they ſaw nothing in the Law but what was exceeding formidable, the flames of Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> before it, and the flames of Hell fire after it: But we Chriſtians being under the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Goſpel, (which diſcharge all that truly repent and unfeignedly believe, from the curſe of the Law and from the guilt of their ſins) have the ſpirit of liberty, whereby we can with great confidence, and with greater comfort, draw near to the throne of grace: The Jews had the Spirit of Adoption as well as Chriſtians (though not in the ſame degree,) but not from the Law but from ſo much of the Goſpel as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them: And the Chriſtians have alſo the ſpirit of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age as well as the Jews, (though not in the ſame degree) but not from the Goſpel, but from ſo much of the Law as is ſtill in force to ſcourge them unto Chriſt. The ſame ſpirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to them a ſpirit of bondage, yet with ſome hopes and ſhew of liberty: To us it is a ſpirit of liberty, and yet with ſome fear and ſhew of bondage: They could ſay unto God, Doubtleſs <hi>thou art our Father, though</hi> Abraham <hi>be ignorant of us, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>acknowledge, us not, (Iſa.</hi> 63. 16.) but we can ſay moreover, <hi>Abba Father:</hi> that is, we can call upon God as our Father, with greater fervency and earneſtneſs, with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aſſurance and confidence, and with greater joy and comfort, then they could; For this <hi>Abba Father</hi> is <hi>vox clamantis, vox ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamantis, vox acclamantis;</hi> The voice of one crying out, the voice of one crying out for help, the voice of one crying out for joy. Firſt, <hi>The voice of one crying out,</hi> there's the greater earneſtneſs; they did <hi>ſay</hi> to God <hi>our Father,</hi> but we do <hi>cry it;</hi> not coldly and remiſſely, leaſt our prayers ſhould be congealed in the middle Region of the air, before they get up to heaven, but zealouſly and earneſtly: They ſaid it with zeal, but we ſay it with greater zeal. Secondly, <hi>The voice of one crying out
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:114933:159"/>
for help,</hi> there's the greater confidence; The Jew could ſay Father, but the Chriſtian ſaith <hi>Abba Father,</hi> that is Father, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with greater confidence and aſſurance of Gods paternal affection. Laſtly, <hi>The voice of one crying out for joy,</hi> there's the greater comfort: The Jew could rejoyce in God as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Creation; but the Chriſtian rejoyceth in God as his Father by Redemption: The joy of the creation had an allay becauſe of the ſin and ſorrow which we had brought upon our ſelves; but the joy of our Redemption hath no allay, becauſe our bleſſed Saviour hath taken away our ſins, and with our ſins our ſorrows.</p>

                           <p>SInce it is an undoubted truth that the Holy Ghoſt is the Spirit of Chriſt, we may not doubt but his coming unto men alwayes was and ſtill is of purpoſe to communicate Chriſt unto them; either after an extraordinary manner by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate infuſions and revelations as to the Prophets and Apoſtles, or after an ordinary manner by habitual improvements and aſſiſtances as at this day. For the extraordinary manner of his coming, and the extraordinary manner of his communicating Chriſt to men by immediate infuſions or revelations, did both ceaſe together; And we may truly ſay concerning thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous and extraordinary diſpenſations of the ſpirit, what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid concerning tongues, one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal effects thereof, <hi>They were for a ſign, not to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but to them that believe not, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 22. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were to continue and remain no longer then ſignes and wonders, that is, till the preaching or publiſhing of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or till the planting and ſetling the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                           <p>For Saint <hi>Peter</hi> plainly ſheweth in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> That this Prophecy of <hi>Joel, In the laſt dayes, ſaith God, I will your out of my ſpirit upon all fleſh,</hi> was fulfilled in the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, that theſe were the laſt dayes meant by that Prophet, and therefore after thoſe dayes, men were not to expect any more ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſpenſations: Wherefore thoſe that will now preach or pray by the Spirit, may not rely upon infuſions for which
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:114933:164"/>
they have no warrant, but muſt betake themſelves diligently to read and conſider the word of God, that ſo they may have the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God; For they that go about to ſeparate the Spirit from the Word, are the moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Separiſts that ever were, or can be in the world, becauſe they endeavour to ſeparate God from himſelf; for Gods word is Gods truth, and Gods truth is himſelf. Be it then taken for granted, which may not be doubted, it cannot be denyed that they are very wicked <hi>Separatiſts</hi> who <hi>ſeparate man from man,</hi> for they fill the world with <hi>ſedition and privy conſpiracy;</hi> They yet worſe Separatiſts, who <hi>ſeparate man from God,</hi> for they fill the world with falſe doctrine and hereſie; But yet ſtill they are the worſt Separatiſts of all <hi>who ſeparate God from God,</hi> that is, Gods Spirit from Gods Word, for they fill the world with <hi>hardneſs of heart, contempt of Gods Word and Commandment;</hi> which is the ready way to make men firſt impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and then unpardonable; and what more can be ſaid of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt? Yet theſe three ſeparations do ſo naturally and neceſſarily ſpring from one another, that they may be accounted themſelves inſeparable. For the ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on begets the hereſie, and the hereſie begets the hardneſs of heart; ſeparating man from man by ſedition will ſeparate man from God by hereſie; and that will alſo in a ſhort time endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſeparate God from himſelf, by contempt of his Word and Commandments: What an unhappy age do we live in, wherein men think they do God good ſervice, to run away from his Word, by pretending to his Spirit!

were not one and the ſame ſpirit that once directed him, and ſtill directeth us to call upon the Father; Doubleſs ſuch men cannot take it unkindly, that we abſtain from communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with their prayers, ſince they by rejecting the Lords own holy prayer, do at the ſame time reject commnnion not only with all the ſervants, but alſo with the Spirit and with the Son of God; for the Servants of God alwayes uſed it, the Spirit of God indited it, the Son of God commanded it; Tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if ſuch men be not only Sacrilegious, but alſo perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there is no ſuch ſin as ſacriledge, and conſequently that whatſoever hath been conſecrated to Gods Holy name, is ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy and prophane, though it hath been conſcrated according to Gods own expreſs command in the fourth commandment, which is the commandment of conſecrations, and requires the ſanctification of place, and of perſons, and of our ſubſtance to Gods publike worſhip, as well as of time; Time cannot be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, or kept holy to Gods publick worſhip without theſe; And beſides, we find theſe alſo expreſly commanded in other parts of the Bible, and ſince they are all commanded for one and the ſame end, we muſt reduce the Texts concerning them to one and the ſame commandment, for the ten commandments are <hi>Decem ſumma genera,</hi> as it were ten predicaments or ten general heads to which is to be reduced whatſoever is commanded as a moral duty in the whole word of God: wherefore ſince it is a moral duty that men ſhould publikely and ſolemnly call upon the name of God, and time alone, without place and perſons, and the maintenance of theſe cannot ſerve for the diſcharge of that duty, we muſt allow the reſt of theſe outward requiſites to be commanded in this of time; And conſequently, what of all theſe alike was common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy before it was ſanctified to Gods publike worſhip, being once ſanctified thereunto is made peculiar and proper to God; and therefore to rob, or pillage, or take away any of theſe, is ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to invade Gods property; which is a ſin of ſo heavy a burden to preſs down the ſoul, that the Apoſtle hath put it in the ſcale againſt Idolatry, and ſeems to make this at leaſt to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, if not to out-weigh the other; <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit Sacriledge? Rom.</hi> 2. 22. The argument would be of little conſequence, if Sacriledge were not a ſin at leaſt equal

to Idolatry; And truly ſo it is, (whatever we pleaſe to think or to make of it;) For whereas there are two kinds of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the one to take an Idol for God, the other to make God himſelf for an Idol; the ſacrilegious perſon is in effect guilty of them both: For it is impoſſible that any man ſhould rob God if he did not make money his God, there's taking the Idol for God: or if he did not take God for one to be mocked rather then worſhipped; there's taking God for an Idol: And tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they can do all this, who can contemn the Lords moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer: for the three firſt petitions of that prayer contain all the Duty of the firſt table; and the leaſt part we can ſhew of dutifullneſs is to pray that we may be dutifull: and conſequently he that will not ſay Our father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, cannot be troubled at that Sin of Sacriledge, whoſe property it is to invade and profane all that is dedicated to the hallowing of the name of God; For they that can ſwallow the Camel, have little reaſon to ſtrain at the gnat, they that can be guilty of the greater, cannot ſtick at the leſſer Sacriledge; they that can rob God of his publike worſhip, cannot eaſily make any ſcruple of robbing his Church; and to take away ſuch publike prayers as do undoubtedly glorifie the name of God, what is it elſe but to rob God of his worſhip, or of the honour due unto his name? For he that doth forbid us to take his name in vain, doth withall command us to glorifie his name, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to make uſe of ſuch forms of prayer and of praiſe as we are ſure do moſt glorifie him; Theſe forms being accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly made for the honour of God after the rule of the two firſt, and in obedience to the third Commandment, are ſet apart for this uſe, in obedience to the fourth; and to take away theſe forms, is in effect to ſin againſt all the firſt Table: And they who are guilty of this ſin, even of putting down the true ſervice of God, are guilty of many ſins together; for as they ſin againſt the third Commandment, they are guilty of blaſphemy; as againſt the fourth, they are guilty of ſacriledge and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs; and as they ſin againſt the firſt and ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, denying men (as much as in them lies,) to have God for their God, and to worſhip him with internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal worſhip, according to his own holy will and command, ſo they are downright guilty of Irreligion and of Idolatry.</p>

And what is it for others to rely upon pretences, inſtead of Certainties in Gods worſhip, but in effect to make themſelves guilty of Idolatry? For to ſpeak the plain truth in this caſe, the people do worſhip God not in their own Faith, but in the faith of their Miniſter if they pray with him as Communicants, before they know what he will pray, which is to be guilty of will-worſhip, whiles they reſign up their ſouls in a blind obedience: or the miniſter alone doth worſhip God, whiles the People are preſent only as Judges, not as Communicants, reſerving their ſouls unto themſelves, all the time he is praying, till they ſee they can ſafely ſay Amen at the end of his prayer, which is in effect to have no publike worſhip till the worſhip be quite done; for publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is not rightly ſo called from its company, but from its communion; And <hi>Saint Paul</hi> would never have commanded all gifts whatſoever, (in that he commanded the firſt gift, the gift of tongues, which came immediately from the Holy-Ghoſt) to ſubmit to Edification, if he would have allowed any other gift afterwards to oppoſe it ſelf againſt, much leſs to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it ſelf above true Chriſtian communion, ſince it is a plain caſe that Chriſtian communion was at firſt commanded, and ought to be ſtill obſerved chiefly for Edification.</p>

                           <p>Tis not imaginable that our Saviour Chriſt ſhould diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage either the gift of prayer, or the uſe of that gift in making long prayers; for himſelf <hi>continued all night in prayer to God, Luke</hi> 6. 12. And ſpake a parable, <hi>that men ought alwayes to pray and not to faint, Luke</hi> 18. 1. Therefore we may be ſure it is a grievous ſin to make long prayers for a pretence, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf may ſeem to diſlike the prayers, rather then he would not condemn the pretence: And queſtionleſs ſuch Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are moſt abominable Idolaters; for whiles they make pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers meerly for pretences, <hi>they make God an Idol:</hi> and whiles they make them for pretences of devouring, <hi>they make Mammon their God;</hi> And this is the twofold Idolatry of Hypocrites, <hi>they pray not to glorifie God,</hi> and to do ſo, is to make God an Idol: <hi>they pray to enrich themſelves,</hi> and to do ſo, is to make <hi>Mammon</hi> their God; <hi>they pray that they may devour.</hi>

Becauſe God intended not to heal the wound or to repair the ruine of the Angels, but he intended to heal the wound and repair the ruine of man: ſo is it ſtill; where God will not heal the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he ſuffers their ſin to be undiſcovered and unreproved; but if he be pleaſed to reprove them, tis becauſe he is willing to heal them. And if the mouths of unruly vain talkers and deceivers muſt be ſtopped by the Miniſters; then ſurely their communion and their Doctrine both, muſt be ſhunned and abandoned by the people, who can have no pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe if they be miſled by falſe Prophets, ſince the Text bids them, (in this caſe) appeal, not to their judgements, wherein they might poſſibly be miſguided by miſperſwaſions, but to their ſenſes, wherein themſelves are infallible Judges; for ſaith our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>ye ſhall know them by their fruits, Mat.</hi> 7. 16.

He may not leave a good, and go to a bad tree to gather good fruit: The falſe Prophets will ſay, <hi>Lo here is Chriſt,</hi> as well as the true Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 23. Yet our Saviour ſaith, <hi>believe them not:</hi> What ſhall the people do in ſuch a caſe? ſhall they not believe the Prophets?

falſe: Whether the ſcoffing <hi>Iſmael</hi> or the patient <hi>Iſaac:</hi> Whether the covetous <hi>Balaam</hi> who loveth the wages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, or the obedient <hi>Eliſha</hi> who ſlayeth his Oxen, and burneth his Plow, to ſhew that no worldly intereſt can keep him from his calling; Whether a falſe and a fierce <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> that is ready to Prophecy according to the mind of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> and to ſmite a true Prophet on the cheek: or a true and a mild <hi>Micaiah</hi> who vows to ſpeak only what the Lord ſhall ſay unto him, (though he be ſent to the priſon never ſo often) and who forbears to give ill words when he is ſmitten; Laſtly, whether a proud <hi>Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preheminence, and receiveth not the brethren, but prateth againſt them with malicious words;</hi> or a meek and modeſt <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, that hath a good report of all men, and of the truth it ſelf:</hi> In a word, whether he that ſerveth the times, or he that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Lord; whether he that invadeth anothers right, to forſake his Religion, or he that forſaketh his own right to keep and practiſe his Religion? Surely it can be no hard matter, for the people to diſcern in ſuch a caſe on which ſide Chriſt is, and on which ſide he is not: and if they will not diſcern, we cannot ſay <hi>this people who knoweth not the Law are curſed,</hi> but this people are <hi>curſed becauſe they will not know the Law;</hi> they will not know that Chriſt is to be found in the temple among the Doctors, not among the mony-changers; and out of the temple among juſt, obedient, patient men that are ready to ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake; not among unjuſt, rebellious, outragious men, that are ready to devour thoſe that are more righteous then themſelves: For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the works of the fleſh, uſeth this introduction, <hi>Now the works of the fleſh are manifeſt,</hi> therefore as eaſily to be diſcerned by the ignorant as by the learned; by the people, as by the Prieſts; they are manifeſt; for all men to ſee them, and for ſuch men as do them not, to avoid and abandon thoſe that do them; and the ſame Saint <hi>Paul</hi> after he hath ſpoken of the works of the fleſh with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaying, <hi>and ſuch like</hi> (for fear we ſhould think he had named them all in naming thoſe few,) uſeth this concluſion; <hi>of the which I tell you, that they who do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> doubtleſs with an intent to inſtruct the people as well as the Prieſt, the unlearned

as well as the learned, that thoſe who have not done ſuch things, ſhould take heed of doing them; and thoſe who have done ſuch things (to procure ſome worldly advantages) ſhould take heed of doing them any more, unleſs they will ſo look after the inheritance of this world, as not to inherit the Kingdom of God: All the works of the fleſh which the Apoſtle there numbreth, do directly proceed either from the ſinfull <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the body,</hi> as adultery, fornication, uncleanneſs, laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiouſneſs, drunkenneſs, revellings; or from the more ſinful, though leſs viſible <hi>diſtemper of the ſoul,</hi> as idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife, ſedition, hereſies, envyings, murders. The diſtemper of the body is the more opprobious, the more ſcandalous; the diſtemper of the ſoul is the more dangerous, the more pernicious; I find <hi>Noah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his drunkenneſs, I find not that <hi>Cham</hi> repented, who mocked at his fathers nakedneſs: I find that <hi>David</hi> repented of his adultery and of his uncleanneſs, I find not that <hi>Doeg</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his cruelty and of his maliciouſneſs; I find Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans repenting who thought themſelves ſinners, I find no Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees repenting who thought themſelves Saints: I will pray as heartily as I can, that God will keep me from the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of my body, leſt I ſhould defile the members of Chriſt, and the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt: But above all will I pray that God will keep me from the diſtempers of my ſoul, for they will downright expell Chriſt out of my heart, and bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Holy Ghoſt: For the temper of Chriſt was the temper of charity and of humility, and ſo alſo is the temper of the good Chriſtian; <hi>Come unto me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, not go from me, there's the temper of charity, to invite and embrace, not to repell and reject others; <hi>for I am meek and lowly in heart,</hi> there's the temper of humility; <hi>lowly in heart,</hi> and cannot be of that pride as to forget my ſelf; <hi>meek in heart,</hi> and cannot be of that preſumption as to diſdain and reproach my brother; where you find not this temper, there you may not ſeek for Chriſt; where you do find the contrary diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, (in the forenamed works of the fleſh,) there you are ſure not to find the Spirit of Chriſt, and therefore muſt come with your <hi>libera nos Domine</hi> (though you care not to have the Letanie) and ſay, <hi>Good Lord deliver me from ſuch profeſſors,

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:114933:172"/>
moſt comfortable praiſe: Only the prayer proceedeth from the great apprehenſion and conſtant neceſſity of our own mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wants and imperfections, even in our beſt condition; But the praiſe proceedeth from the comfortable enjoyment of Gods undeſerved goodneſs in mercies received, and more comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aſſurance of his everlaſting mercies, in bleſſings promiſed; So that the uncomfortableneſs of the prayer is from the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our own ſpirits concerning our miſeries and ſorrows in our ſelves; but the comfortableneſs of the praiſe, is from the teſtimony of Gods Holy Spirit concerning the bleſſings and joys treaſured up for us in our Redeemer.

And as this joy of the good Chriſtian is unſequeſtrable, not to be taken from him, ſo is it alſo unſpeakable, not to be expreſſed by him: thus ſaith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Whom having not ſeen ye love, in whom though now ye ſee him not, yet believing ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 8.

Who can ſufficiently admire the goodneſs of God in giving the gift of faith unto men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in ſome ſort to antedate the beatifical viſion, and to let us into heaven whiles we live here on earth?

Theſe our ſacrifices as they do expreſs our joy in Chriſt, ſo they ſhould alſo anſwer it: and therefore when we have the greateſt joyes, we ſhould alſo have the greateſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: For the analogie or proportion is not only <hi>hiſtorical,</hi> but alſo <hi>cauſal,</hi> which we find ſet forth betwixt the joy of Gods people and their Sacrifices, <hi>Nehem. 12. 43. Alſo that day they offered great ſacrifices, and rejoyced, for God hath made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with great joy:</hi> Becauſe their joy was great, their ſacrifice alſo was great: God had made them rejoyce with great joy on that day, and therefore alſo on that day they offered great ſacrifices: And this is the reaſon why the Church of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth to us <hi>ſolemn Feſtivals</hi> as daies wherein the Lord hath made us rejoyce with great joy: and as <hi>ſolemn ſacrifices for thoſe feſtivals,</hi> particularly the receiving the holy Euchariſt, and the giving of alms (the two proper ſacrifices of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) that our ſacrifices may be in ſome ſort anſwerable to our joy. For all the ſacrifices we can offer unto God cannot be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the joy we have in him, and from him, (and much leſs anſwerable to the joy which we hope to have with him.) And will you ſee the reaſon of this joy? it is by reaſon of the comfort and conſolation that good men have in and from God, when they cannot have it in or from the world: They have comfort from the Comforter, and may well have joy with their comfort: This made Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bleſs God for all the troubles and tribulations he had from men, becauſe the more they trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, the more his God comforted him, and enabled him to comfort others, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 3, 4.

prayer that was in Chriſt; therefore to aſſure us that both do pray in the communion of the ſame Spirit, both are ſet down praying in the communion of the ſame words: But yet, whether S. <hi>Mark</hi> borrowed this from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or not, the doubt ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, why this Abba Father is in two ſeveral languages, when as the reduplication might happily have been as emphatical in one tongue as in two; I anſwer with Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Abba propter illorum linguam, pater propter noſtram (Aug. in Pſal.</hi> 78.) To ſhew that Chriſt did no leſs belong to the Gentiles then he did to the Jews, he uſeth a Greek word that ſignifies father for the Gentiles, as well as a Syriack word, that ſignifies father for the Jews; (for at that time the Jews themſelves commonly ſpake Syriack, having in the Babylonian captivity learned to mix Chaldee with Hebrew, which mixture begat the Syriack) The effect of Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> anſwer is this; Syriack and Greek are both joined together, to ſhew the communion of Jew and Gentile in Chriſt; we may add, and not only ſo, but alſo to ſhew the cauſe of that communion, even the communication of the ſame ſpirit to them both; which when it deſcended viſibly upon the Apoſtles, endued them with the gift of tongues; and the ſcripture ſtill retaining the variety of languages in this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Father, doth not only commemorate that miraculous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, but doth alſo confirm his continual deſcending upon us, with as good ſucceſs, though not with as great a miracle; For he teacheth us no leſs then he taught them to cry Abba Father, which puts me upon a ſecond queſtion, who it is that cries Abba Father? is it his ſpirit or our own? I anſwer, tis his Spirit, not our own; tis indeed our voice, but tis his breath; for we cannot ſay Abba Father by the breath and power of our own, but only by the breath and power of his Spirit; and by that we can ſay it with an undaunted courage, and do ſay it with an immortal comfort, becauſe with a hope full of immortality: Tis then his Spirit that crieth Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther though in our mouths; And this crying Abba Father is more fully expreſſed, <hi>Rom. 8. 26. The ſpirit helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be uttered;</hi> whence it may be gathered that the gift of prayer is more in groans then in words: more in groans which cannot,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:114933:180"/>
then in words which can be uttered: for <hi>Moſes</hi> cried unto the Lord when he ſpake not one word; (<hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>Wherefore crieſt thou unto me? Exod.</hi> 14. 15.) So that he prayed by the Spirit whiles his tongue ſtood ſtill, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the gift or ſpirit of prayer (here meant by crying Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Father) may not be placed in voluble effuſions, but in ſtrong affections; not ſo much in the tongue as in the heart; for elſe many adopted Sons muſt be denied to have the Spirit of Chriſt, who cannot pour out their conceptions in multiplicity of words; And (which is as bad) many muſt be affirmed to have the Spirit of Chriſt, who are <hi>enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their belly, and whoſe glory is in their ſhame, who mind earthly things;</hi> for many of theſe men may and do attain to a great perfection in extemporary effuſions, we dare not then ſay that all thoſe who take upon them to be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the gift of prayer, do truly cry Abba Father, or do pray by the Spirit of Chriſt, becauſe we ſee that many of them by their works do oppoſe the name, and blaſpheme the truth of Chriſt; and bring themſelves under that terrible reproof and more terrible reproach, <hi>They profeſs that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and diſobedient, and unto every good work reprobate, Tit.</hi> 1. 16. But there are doubtleſs many others, more concerned in the gift, though leſs in the pretence of the Spirit, who make <hi>not ſo many words,</hi> but yet make <hi>more prayers,</hi> even whiles they make uſe of thoſe prayers which their Church hath made for them, for theſe bring their groans, though not their words; and thoſe groans are the groans of the Spirit; which without doubt may as well (if not better) accompany a prayer that we are ſure is according to the mind of Chriſt, as a prayer that we cannot tell whether it will be ſo or no; However, we cannot deny but every one who truly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the ſpirit of Chriſt, may ſay what holy <hi>David</hi> hath put into his mouth, and the Holy Spirit put into the mouth of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Oh come hither and hearken all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what he hath done for my ſoul: I called upon him with my mouth, and gave him praiſes with my tongue; If I incline unto wickedneſs with my heart, the Lord will not hear me; But God hath heard me and conſidered the voice of my prayer; praiſed be God which hath not caſt out my prayer, nor turned his mercy from me,

Pſal. 66. v. 14, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſaid, This great miracle of mercy hath God done for my ſoul, which I cannot but ſpeak; &amp; all you that fear him, ſhall do well to hear, he gave me his ſpirit to call upon him with my mouth, &amp; to give him praiſes with my tongue; and becauſe praiſe is not commonly in the mouth of a ſinner, and cannot be acceptable from it; he gave me his ſpirit alſo to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my heart, that it ſhould not incline to wickedneſs; &amp; hence it is that I do heartily praiſe him for enabling me to pray, becauſe praying in the ſpirit of his Son, I can pray in comfort, that he will not caſt away my prayer, becauſe he cannot caſt away his only Son; nor turn away his mercy from me, becauſe he cannot turn away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his own Spirit, which by his mercy, is now beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e mine.</p>

                           <p>But is the ſpirit therefore gone when the voice is gone? or is the Holy Ghoſt no longer in our hearts, then Abba Father is in our mouths?

I anſwer for Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that either the ſpirit was not quite gone from him, or elſe ſoon returned unto him, which appears by the ſpeedineſs and by the entireneſs of his repentance in that he wept ſuddenly, and he wept bitterly; for he had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar prayer and promiſe of Chriſt that his faith ſhould not fail; I anſwer for others of Gods adopted children, as my late reverend and learned Dioceſan taught me out of Saint <hi>Ambroſe, Deus nunquam reſcindit donum Adoptionis,</hi> God never cuts off his entaile; if once adopted; ever adopted, and out of Biel, <hi>Eos <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

All thoſe who at laſt fall away from their ſalvation, were never the children of God by adoption: (Biſhop <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> in his third determination) or rather as Saint <hi>John</hi> taught them all three, <hi>If they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us, 1 John</hi> 2. 19. But withal I muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt adoption and the ſtate of adoption: betwixt ſalvation and the ſtate of ſalvation; for there is <hi>ſalus &amp; ſtatus ſalutis,</hi> ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and the ſtate of ſalvation, as there is <hi>peccatum &amp; ſtatus peccati,</hi> ſin and the ſtate of ſin, And the ſtate of either is ſuch as it is in relation to us, and to our reception of it. <hi>In actionibus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis dicitur negotium aliquem ſtatum habere, ſecundum ordinem propriae diſpoſitionis cum quadam immobilitate ſeu quiete,</hi> (<hi>22ae.</hi> 183. 1.) <hi>in humane actions the ſtate of a buſineſs ſhews the immoveableneſs of its diſpoſition;</hi> ſo the ſtate of ſin is a kind of immoveableneſs in ſin, and the ſtate of Adoption is a kind of immoveableneſs in adoption: But yet we men are not alike immoveable in both ſtates; becauſe the ſtate of ſin is wholly of our own making, and therefore may get ſome ſtability from us; But the ſtate of grace is wholly of our receiving, not of our making, and therefore loſeth of its ſtability (as alſo of its perfection) from the mutable and ſinfull condition of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Hence it is, that though to be in ſin, is much leſs then to be in the ſtate of ſin: yet to be in Adoption and Salvation, is much more then to be in the ſtate of either; For though we can add to our own miſery, yet we can only diminiſh from Gods mercy: For Adoption and Salvation are much greater in Gods giving, then in our receiving, and conſequently the Adoption is greater then the ſtate of Adoption, and the ſalvation then the ſtate of ſalvation, according to the old rule, <hi>Quicquid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis; whatſoever is received, follows more the nature and condition of the receiver then of the giver;</hi> And hence it is that even the adopted Sons of God, have by fearfull failings and fallings made diſputable for a time the ſtate of their ſalvation, though their ſalvation hath by Gods infinite goodneſs been made indiſputable: For there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>, the act is gone (or ceſſant) yet we may as truly ſay, That Gods Elect are not ſaved only by habits: and therefore the acts of grace if they have been expelled, muſt neceſſarily return again, either to keep or to put them in the ſtate of ſalvation, either to retain them in it, or to reſtore them to it, before they can be actually ſaved. And in this ſenſe may we expound Saint <hi>James</hi> his queſtion, <hi>What doth it profit my Brethren, though a man ſay, He hath faith, and have not works, can faith ſave him? James</hi> 2. 14. As if he had ſaid, It is not the ſleepy habit, but the vigorous act of faith (and of all other graces) that brings a man to ſalvation. And by this means we ſhall reconcile Saint <hi>James</hi> his works, and Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> faith in the Doctrine of Juſtification; For Saint <hi>James</hi> affirming that we are juſtified by works, doth include faith in thoſe works; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirming we are juſtified by faith, doth include works in that faith: both of them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>a faith working by love, Gal.</hi> 5. 6. though Saint <hi>James</hi> comprehend the faith in the works, as the cauſe in the effect: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> comprehend the works in the faith, as the effect in the cauſe.</p>
                           <p>And Saint <hi>James</hi> as juſtly urgeth the neceſſity of works againſt hypocrites; who deceived themſelves with a vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of faith in Chriſt, and ſo did not look after the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of works; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> urged the neceſſity of faith againſt the Phariſees, who truſting to the righteouſneſs of the Law, did not at all look after the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: Both Saint <hi>James</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> will have us juſtified by Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (for no other righteouſneſs can acquit and abſolve us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God) only they differently expreſs the inſtrumental cauſe of our Juſtification, which is <hi>faith working by love:</hi> for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that faith hath a twofold act, <hi>actum confidendi &amp; obediendi, An act of believing, and an act of working;</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> rather inſiſts upon the act of believing, becauſe he had to deal with Phariſaical Jews who rejected the Goſpel, and thought they could live according to the rule of the Law; But Saint <hi>James</hi> rather inſiſts upon the act of working, becauſe he had to deal with Hypocritical Chriſtians, who abuſed the Goſpel of Chriſt, to lawleſs licentiouſneſs of living: And therefore in Saint <hi>James</hi> his Divinity, it is as great an abſurdity to ſuppoſe true faith
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:114933:182"/>
without its proper act of working, and conſequently, by the rule of analogie, to ſuppoſe the habit of righteouſneſs without the exerciſe of righteouſneſs, as to ſuppoſe true faith and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs without ſalvation: For the act of working being as eſſential to a juſtifying faith, as the act of believing; He that will go about to ſeparate true faith from working, may as well go about to ſeparate it from believing; and as well make faith no faith, as make it no working faith.</p>
                           <p>But how this faith ſheweth its work in thoſe who are carried away with any grievous temptation, is not ſo eaſie to diſcover: though that it hath its work, is unreaſonable to deny: Therefore Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his apologie for King <hi>David,</hi> affords us a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold excuſe of his ſin, 1. <hi>Quia din noluit in peccato manere. 2. Quia corde doluit. 3. Quia potius fragilitate naturae quàm libidine peccandi. Gratianus de Poenit. lib. 3. c.</hi> 25. 1. That he would not long continue in his ſin: (I ſuppoſe he meaneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been reproved for it; for elſe he was too long in it, at leaſt a whole year.) 2. That he did repent of it with all his heart. 3. That he had fallen into it rather out of weakneſs then of willfulneſs: now if you will ask the reaſon of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance before his ſin, of his regret and reluctancie in it, of his repentance after it, you will anſwer your ſelf, it was from ſome good principle of the ſpirit within, which made him war againſt the fleſh, even at that very inſtant when he was overcome by the ſtrength of its temptation: And accordingly he uſeth theſe words in his firſt penitential prayer, <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy ſpirit from me:</hi> The holy Spirit was certainly in him when he repented, and therefore not taken away from him when he ſinned: And thus much <hi>Aquinas</hi> is willing to admit, <hi>Quod Charitas ex parte Spiritus Sancti mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventis animum ad diligendum Deum, impeccabilitatem habet: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde impoſſible eſt haec duo ſimul eſſe vera, quod Spiritus Sanctus velit aliquem movere ad actum charitatis, &amp; quod ipſe charitatem amittat peccando;</hi> (22<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Charity (or Grace) as it proceeds from the Holy Ghoſt moving the ſoul to love God, is not to be loſt by ſin; wherefore it is impoſſible that theſe two propoſitions ſhould be both true, That the Holy Ghoſt will move a man to love God, and that he by his ſin ſhould loſe that love. We conclude then, That they who have
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:114933:182"/>
once received the Spirit of adoption, do ſtill retain him; for Gods gifts are without repentance, and therefore he giveth not his Holy Spirit, the greateſt of all his gifts, that he may take him away again: But this Spirit ſtill abideth in the children of God, and will not let them be wholly conquered, much leſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivated by the fleſh, but either holdeth them up that they may not fall, or raiſeth them up when they are down: <hi>For the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this Seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his; And let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 19. The firſt part of this ſeal cannot be ſo much as changed, <hi>The Lord knoweth them that are his;</hi> for as God himſelf is immutable, ſo is his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; And the ſecond part of this ſeal can never be totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity;</hi> for he that nameth the name of Chriſt, ſo as to love what he nameth, doth certainly either firſt or laſt depart from iniquity; departing from it either by his righteouſneſs or by his repentance. For though man may be and often is wanting to God, yet God is never wanting to himſelf; Shall his Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a good work and not accompliſh it? Shall he lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and not finiſh the building? We know what our Saviour hath ſaid in this kind, <hi>Which of you intending to build a Tower, ſitteth not down firſt and counteth the coſt, whether he have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to finiſh it? leaſt haply after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finiſh it, all that behold it, begin to mock him, ſaying, This man began to build, and was not able to finiſh, Luke</hi> 14. 28, 29, 30. Be it ſo that we may paſs this jeer and ſcoff upon man, but let us not think it may be paſſed upon God: For it were not only unrighteous, but alſo unreaſonable to aſcribe leſs to the Spirit of Grace, then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribeth to the Word of Grace, ſince the Word is made powerful by the Spirit which accompanieth it: but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribeth the power of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Word of Gods grace, ſaying, <hi>And now Brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified, Acts</hi> 20. 32. If the word of grace be able to build you up, then ſure the Spirit of grace much more; which is not only able but alſo willing to build you up, or elſe he would never have begun to lay the foundation; and when power and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:114933:183"/>
will are both in the premiſes, the work or effect muſt be in the concluſion; So then, though we be caſt down, yet ſince the Spirit of God is both able and willing to build us up, we have a firm hope to be raiſed at laſt as high as heaven; for though hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be as far above our deſerts, as above our reach, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt but he that hath given us an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified, will alſo give us an inheritance among all them which are glorified; And thus the ſame <hi>Aquinas</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounds our hope of ſalvation which we have in this life, not upon mans righteouſneſs which may fade and decay in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but upon Gods almighty power and all-ſaving mercy, which can never decay: <hi>Spes viatorum non innititur principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gratiae jam habitae, ſed divinae omnipotentiae &amp; miſericordie, per quam etiam qui gratiam non habet, eam conſequi poteſt:</hi> Our hope of ſalvation doth not rely principally upon the grace which we have, but upon Gods power and mercy, whereby they may have grace who yet have it not, and conſequently we may come to have grace again if we ſhould loſe it: Therefore though we ſhould ſuppoſe without hereſie, that grace it ſelf may fail, yet we cannot ſuppoſe without infidelity, that Gods power and mercy ſhould ever fail; and that can as eaſily reſtore grace, as it did at firſt give it: But Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> will not let us go ſo far in our ſuppoſition, having thus dogmatically determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this controverſie, (though ſome of his own Church will ſcarce now ſtand to it as to his decretory ſentence, or Papal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination) <hi>Quod in illis donis, ſine quibus ad vitam pervenire non poteſt, ſpiritus ſanctus in electis omnibus ſemper manet, ſed in aliis non ſemper manet, Greg. 2. Moral.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt doth alwaies abide in Gods elect, as to thoſe gifts without which they cannot be ſaved, though in regard of other gifts and graces, he may be ſaid ſometimes to depart from them. Wherefore we are ſure the Spirit of his Son is alwaies in their hearts who are adopted, to work in them an habitual perſeverance in godlineſs, for that is abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, though not alwaies to work in them an actual perſeverance in godlineſs, without which they may be ſaved; For the Act of ſin doth not prevail <hi>againſt</hi> the habit of righteouſneſs, and much leſs <hi>above</hi> it: So that the habit of righteouſneſs cannot be captivated under an everlaſting lethargie, that it ſhould alwaies forget its own act;
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:114933:183"/>

                           <p>If Chriſt made ſo great a diſtinction betwixt two of the ſame communion and of the ſame order, no wonder if he ſtill make ſo great a diſtinction, betwixt thoſe that will not be of the ſame Church, who regard neither the Doctrine of Chriſt, nor the communion of Chriſtians! <hi>Judas</hi> the traytor, had not yet forſaken Chriſts Communion, yet was not benefited by his teaching, becauſe he regarded not his Doctrine. <hi>Judas</hi> the Confeſſor that he might be ſure to be well taught by him, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily embraced his Doctrine, and reſolved never to forſake his Communion: And hence it was, that our Saviour Chriſt returned to him <hi>a gracious anſwer for his inſtruction,</hi> teaching him that great Myſterie of the manifeſtation of the Son of God in the ſoul of man: Nay yet more, <hi>a ſatisfactory anſwer for his contentation,</hi> aſſuring him, that he would thus manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto him: The manifeſtation of Chriſt unto the ſoul, is a great myſterie and a greater mercy; the myſterie <hi>inſtructs</hi> the ſoul, but the mercy <hi>contents</hi> it: And well it may, for tis no leſs then eternal life; <hi>In qua quidem manifeſtatione vita aeterna conſiſtit;</hi> as ſaith <hi>Aquinas, in which manifeſtation of Chriſt unto the ſoul, conſiſteth eternal life;</hi> and he proveth his ſaying from John 17. 3. <hi>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Christ whom thou haſt ſent, (Aquin. 22. qu. 24. art.</hi> 12.)

                           <p>The ſtate of ſalvation conſiſts ſo much of love, that tis not poſſible for an <hi>uncharitable,</hi> and much leſs for a <hi>malicious</hi> man, to be in that ſtate, but either he muſt forgoe his malice, or he muſt forgoe his ſalvation; <hi>for God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him, John</hi> 4. 16. No man can be in the ſtate of ſalvation, who hath not communion with God; and there is no having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God but by love; we muſt dwell in love, or he will not dwel in us: And therefore it was moſt Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which was delivered by Saint <hi>Auguſtine, lib. 1. de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina Chriſtiana,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Quatuor ſunt diligenda; unum quod eſt ſupra nos Sc.

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:114933:188"/>
to Chriſt, and as they belong to his communion: For undeniable, if not indiſputable is that poſition of the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Doctor, <hi>Amicitia charitatis ſuper communicatione beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinis fundatur, The friendſhip of Chriſtian charity is founded upon the communication of eternal bleſſedneſs; (Aquin. 22<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yet even from this excellent ground of charity, do many men find a pretence for groſs uncharitableneſs, whilſt thoſe that are of divers perſwaſions in matters of Religion, will needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to one another the hopes of ſalvation; every one being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to maintain, that his own Religion is the only true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, (though it be no more then a profeſſion of it) and all agreeing, that tis only the true Chriſtian Religion wherein and whereby we can attain eternal bleſſedneſs: Hence it is, that we commonly receive thoſe very faintly whom we ſuſpect God hath not received; and thoſe not at all, whom we are perſwaded he will not receive: So that we do little leſs then invade Chriſts Judgement ſeat, that we may diſcard true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charity; and if we now invade his ſeat, we ſhall hereafter tremble at his bar. Why ſhould we ſo groſly abuſe the very ground of Chriſtian charity, to a moſt unchriſtian uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Why ſhould we be ſo haſty to exclude out of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of eternal bleſſedneſs, thoſe whom our Saviour Chriſt hath called to it? Surely, if it be not in our power to give heaven by our charity; tis not in power to deny heaven by our uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, unleſs it be only to our ſelves.</p>
                           <p>True Chriſtian charity is of as large an extent as heaven it ſelf, and embraceth all thoſe who have any probability of getting thither; For it is grounded upon the communion of eternal bliſs; and therefore as it loves Chriſt the head, ſo it cannot but love all Chriſtians as members of that communion: It firſt loves Chriſt for his own ſake, by whom we have the <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> it afterwards loves our Chriſtian brethren for Chriſts ſake, with whom we have inchoately, and hope to have conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

III.</hi> That the ſtate of true Chriſtianity is beſt taught by our Saviour Chriſt, and beſt learned of him; how far the Jews may be ſaid to have known Chriſt and Chriſtianity: That Chriſt teacheth us by his voice in the holy Scriptures, more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then by his voice in holy Church; the Scripture is to teach the Church, as the Church is to teach the people.</head>
                           <p>THere is not in all the world any thing taught by a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher from heaven, but only the Chriſtian Religion: And the Son of God came from heaven to teach that, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers voice came from heaven to bid us obſerve and follow his teaching. <hi>Behold a voice out of the cloud, which ſaid, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him, Mat.</hi> 17. 5. And we may very well be not only <hi>contented,</hi> but alſo <hi>deſirous</hi> to hear him; for the ſtate of true Chriſtianity is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt beſt taught by Chriſt himſelf, and is therefore beſt learned of him; <hi>Moſes was faithful in Gods houſe as a ſervant,</hi> (and the beſt teachers amongſt men can but ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 2.) but <hi>Chriſt was faithful as a Son, Heb.</hi> 3. 5, 6. The ſervant was appointed and ordained for the Son, and ſo was <hi>Moſes</hi> for Chriſt; but the Son came only for himſelf; The ſervant was faithful in his Maſters houſe; but the Son in his own houſe; <hi>Chriſt as a Son, over his own houſe, ver. 6. Moſes</hi> his faithfulneſs was by way of introduction, <hi>for a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of thoſe things which were to be ſpoken after, ver. 5. (ſc.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:114933:189"/>
by Chriſt;</hi>) But Chriſts faithfulneſs was by way of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſpeak thoſe things plainly, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> had teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obſcurely, and to accompliſh or perform whatſoever <hi>Moſes</hi> his teſtimony had either propheſied or promiſed concerning him: For <hi>Moſes</hi> in his writings ſpake of Chriſt, and directed theſe <hi>Jews</hi> unto him, in ſo much that our Saviour telleth the <hi>Jews</hi> that they needed no other then <hi>Moſes</hi> to accuſe them of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief for not turning Chriſtians. <hi>Do not think that I will accuſe you to the Father; there is one that accuſeth you, even</hi> Moſes <hi>in whom ye truſt; For had ye believed</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved me; for he wrote of me; But if ye believe not his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, How ſhall ye believe my words? John</hi> 5. 45, 46, 47. We may put the whole ſenſe of thoſe three verſes into theſe two propoſitions. 1. <hi>That Moſes writ ſo much of Chriſt as to leave the</hi> Jews <hi>inexcuſable if they did not from his writings look after Chriſt, and believe in him;</hi> which more particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15. where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet from the midſt of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me: unto him ye ſhall hearken;</hi> which words we find Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> both, have applied unto Chriſt, proving he was that Prophet to whom <hi>Moſes</hi> had bid them hearken, <hi>Act. 3. 22. &amp; Act.</hi> 7, 37. ſo that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves were no longer to hearken to <hi>Moſes,</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> his own appointment, then till the comming of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>2. <hi>That the Jews who would not believe</hi> Moſes <hi>his writings concerning Chriſt, were not like to believe any other Prophets words concerning him;</hi> which is ſtill a good proof, that no man can poſſibly reject the authority of the Scripture, and yet truly beleive in Chriſt from the authority of the Church; for if the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of the Old Teſtament, then much more the writings of the Apoſtles or of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament muſt needs be above any other Prophets words, ſince theſe writings as well as thoſe are looked upon as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted word of God; And therefore if the Church hath not found Chriſt in the Scriptures, how ſhall we hope to find Chriſt in the Church? and by conſequent, if we will be good Chriſtians, we muſt above all things take heed of cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or rather blaſpheming againſt the word of Chriſt; for that is in effect to ſay, that we will have a ſtate of Chriſtianity,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:114933:190"/>
not of Gods, but of our own making: we queſtion not but the Chriſtian Religion, as it hath an excellency above all other religions, ſo it hath a certainty agreeable to its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
                           <p>And this Certainty is grounded meerly on the written word, in the judgement of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who tels us indeed that there came ſuch a voice from the moſt excellent glory, This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son; in whom I am well pleaſed: and that he and ſome others heard this voice, when they were with Chriſt in the holy mount: but yet that the Scriptures were a more certain ground of the Chriſtian Faith, then was this Voice; for ſo he ſaith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The voice from heaven was ſure, but yet the word of Prophecy was more ſure; for notwithſtanding that voice did ſay, <hi>Hear ye him,</hi> Mat. 17. 5. yet they would have ſuſpended their hearing, but for the word of Prophecy which had ſaid before, <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him ye ſhall hearken,</hi> Deut. 18. 15. So that the voice from heaven had in effect all its certainty from the word of Prophecy; Therefore he ſaid, <hi>we have alſo a more ſure word of Prophecy;</hi> His full intent was to make us ſeek after Chriſt in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> much more in the <hi>New:</hi> He ſaith we ſhall do well to take heed unto <hi>that,</hi> much more unto this; <hi>that</hi> will guide us unto Chriſt as <hi>a light that ſhineth in a dark place,</hi> but this will guide us to him <hi>as a morning Star</hi> that uſhereth in the day: And this is no more then our Saviour himſelf had ſaid before, <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes which ſee the things that ye ſee; For I tell you that many Prophets and Kings have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them, and to hear thoſe things which ye hear, and have not heard them;</hi> Luke 10. 23, 24. The compariſon is betwixt thoſe under the Law, and thoſe under the Goſpel: and they under the Goſpel are declared the more bleſſed; For they under the Law had but a dim light, which made them ſee Chriſt ſo imperfectly as if they had not ſeen him; But we that are under the Goſpel have a clear ſhining light clearly, and perfectly to ſee our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, and therefore are much more bleſſed then they, if we can but ſee our own bleſſedneſs, and will be heartily thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:114933:190"/>
for it; therefore ſaith Saint <hi>John, The Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> John 1. 17. whereby he excludes the Law both from Grace and Truth; from Grace abſolutely, but from Truth only comparatively; The Law did neither teach Grace, nor give Grace; it only gave a rule of righteouſneſs, but not grace to keep it; and therefore only ſhewed our want of a Redeemer, but ſhewed not the way of our redemption; Thus the Law was oppoſed to grace abſolutely, and left that to come wholly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely by Chriſt; and it was alſo oppoſed to Truth compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; for many truths were but obſcurely and figuratively propounded in the Law, which are plainly and ſubſtantially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Goſpel; as the doctrine of the bleſſed Trinity, of the incarnation, paſsion, reſurrection, and aſcenſion of the Son of God, and indeed all the other articles of our Chriſtian faith; So that Truth ſubſtantially or compleatly, that is, in its full revelation and accompliſhment, came only by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore if our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, (who without doubt beſt underſtood the ſtate of true Chriſtianity) ſent the Jews to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be aſſured of the truth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; much more doth he ſend us Chriſtians to his own holy Goſpel, to be aſſured of the ſame truth; And, as <hi>Moſes</hi> his writings were then, ſo the Apoſtles writings are now a greater ground of aſſurance to us, then any Prophets words can be: (for as <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſhed <hi>That all the Lords People were Prophets,</hi> ſo am I willing to believe, that his Church is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a Prophet:) ſo that it commonly fareth with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in their coming unto Chriſt, as it did with the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> John 4. who firſt believed on our bleſſed Saviour for the ſaying of the woman, but afterwards believed becauſe of his own word; So do we generally firſt believe in Chriſt by the teſtimony of the Church, which he hath in mercy appointed to lead us to his Word, (for elſe it were impoſsible we ſhould ever come neer it) But when once we come to ſee and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Word, then we believe in Chriſt, not for his Church, but for himſelf; and may juſtly ſay to the Church, as the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> ſaid to the woman, <hi>Now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we have heard him our ſelves, and know that this is
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:114933:191"/>
indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the world;</hi> John 4. 42. This may we juſtly ſay, <hi>not to the undervaluing of the Church,</hi> to which we are ſo much obliged for bringing us to the knowledge of the Word, (for had not ſhe preſerved and tranſlated it, we could never have known it) but <hi>rather to the overvaluing of the word above the Church,</hi> to ſhew we are infinitely more obliged to God for giving his word, then we can be to his Church, either for preſerving, or for expounding it: Therefore we cannot but prefer the word above the Church, and we know this may be done without either undutifulneſs or unthankfulneſs; ſince God hath appointed that his Church ſhould wholly rely upon his word, and prove her ſelf to be his Church from the Teſtimony of his Word, as appears plainly in the caſe of the <hi>Bereans,</hi> who are commended for ſearching the Scriptures, and believing the Word preached by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> becauſe they found it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the written Word; <hi>Theſe were more noble in that they ſearched the Scriptures, whether thoſe things were ſo; therefore many of them believed;</hi> Acts 17. 11, 12. And ſure, we are to go in the ſame way they did go, unleſs we can prove that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scripture is now leſs Dogmatical then it was in thoſe days, or the Church more Apoſtolical: And there is great Reaſon for it, as well as great Religion. For we plainly ſee that the Church is much ordered according to the will of man; but weare ſure the word was wholy ordered according to the will of God; <hi>For the Propheſie came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 21. We muſt ſay the ſame of the <hi>New,</hi> what he ſaith of the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> for as came the Prophecy of old time, ſo alſo came the Goſpel in the latter times, not by the will of man, but <hi>holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt:</hi> And from hence we muſt conclude the Authority of the Scripture, to be the higheſt authority that can be, in ſetling and eſtabliſhing the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion: For if the Prophets and Apoſtles did not only ſpeak, but alſo write as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt, it muſt needs follow that the doctrine of the Church muſt have its force and weight from their doctrine, but their doctrine from it ſelf, as that which came directly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the Holy Ghoſt, the infallible Spirit of God,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:114933:191"/>
which beſt knew his mind as being his own Spirit, and hath moſt truly derived his mind and meaning to us, as being his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit: So it is evident, The Scripture is no leſs to teach the Church, then the Church is to teach the People, according to that irrefragable determination of their irrefragable Doctor, <hi>Si enim aliquis aſſerit aliquid quod non ſit determinatum in ſacra Scriptura, vel quod non ſequatur directe ex fide, mortaliter peccat, quia ſe conſtieuit ſupra Deum: Judex enim eſt ſupra id de quo debet judicare; Qui ergo ſuâ authoritate aſſerit aliquid de Deo, ponit ſe ſupra Deum, quia judicat de Deo.

If any Doctor, and (conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently if any Church which is but a company of Doctors) doth poſitively affirm any thing (as matter of Faith or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) which is is not directly determined in the holy Scriptures, or doth not inevitably follow from the Faith therein revealed, he ſinneth mortally, becauſe he exalteth himſelf above God; For the Judge is above that of which he is to judge; Therefore he who without warrant from God poſitively aſſerteth any thing of God, putteth himſelf above God in that he judgeth of God: which is the Spiritual pride forbidden by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. Be not wiſe above what is required, but be wiſe to Sobriety: Therefore ſurely the Church cannot teach that as a Doctrine of Chriſtianity, which ſhe hath not learned of Chriſt; and where hath ſhe learned of Chriſt but in his Word?</p>

And by the ſame reaſon the Chriſtian Church is ſtill bound to take care that the Goſpel or New Teſtament be alſo read in our Churches, which becauſe it cannot in the original tongue, wherein it was written, to the Edification of the people, the Church is bound to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it into ſuch languages as the people do underſtand, that ſhe may not be defective in her truſt, which is to uſe the word of God moſt for Gods glory and for his peoples good: And
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:114933:192"/>
that Church doth in this particular beſt diſcharge her truſt, which ſets forth the word of God in the trueſt and fitteſt tranſlation; not rigidly according to the words, (in all places,) but yet exactly according to the ſenſe; for neither doth Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf nor his holy Apoſtles cite the Old Teſtament ſo much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the words, as according to the ſenſe: And if men had no other obligation to their Church but only this, <hi>That they could not know what God had ſaid in his holy word, unleſs their Church had taught them,</hi> yet this alone, (if rightly weighed,) would keep them both from Hereſie and from Schiſm: from Hereſie, in receding from that doctrine which came from God: and from Schiſm, in receding from that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion wherein they were firſt made partakers of that doctrine. This is certain, the Text ſaith plainly, <hi>The Lord, added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved, Acts</hi> 2. 47. which would never have been written, if to depart from the doctrine, or to be out of the communion of the Church, were the ready way of Salvation. Therefore as S. <hi>Peter</hi> once ſaid to our bleſſed Saviour, ſo ought all good Chriſtians ſtill to ſay unto his Church, for rightly tranſlating the word of Chriſt, <hi>Lord to whom ſhall we go? thou haſt the words of eternal life, John</hi> 6. 68. for without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion God did not put it in the power and will of his Church to give unto his people the words of eternal life, that they ſhould run away either from her doctrine or from her communion; <hi>The hour is coming and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, John</hi> 5. 25. Sweet Jeſus, make the dead; to hear thy voice, for the living do little leſs then ſcorn it. And this document or inſtruction, as it much concerns the word preached, ſo it much more concerns the word written, which hath alwayes in all ages and in all Churches been taught more incorruptly and more impartially by <hi>Tranſlations</hi> then by <hi>Expoſitions;</hi> For in Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons men generally follow Gods truth, but in expoſitions they too too often follow their own inventions, if not their own intereſts.</p>
                           <p>Thus have men little reaſon to depart from the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therein Chriſt teacheth by his word; and yet much leſs, becauſe he therein teacheth by his ſpirit: for it is clear that the ſpirit goeth along with the word, in that Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaith unto the Jews, Ye do alwayes reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51.

He tells us of a Church of God in <hi>Corinth</hi> as well as in Rome, and in other places as well as in <hi>Corinth,</hi> which are ſanctified and called to be Saints, the one as well as the other; and he proves it, becauſe the Lord Jeſus, whoſe name they call on, is both theirs and ours, therefore have they Grace and peace from him, as well as we. And the like is Saint <hi>Peters</hi> doctrine when he ſaith, <hi>Of a truth I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every Nation he that feareth him and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted with him, Acts</hi> 10. 34, 35. He ſaith, <hi>of a truth I perceive
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:114933:194"/>
that</hi> God is no reſpecter of perſons; not that he had firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, for <hi>Moſes</hi> had perceived the ſame before, and had told the Jews ſo. <hi>For the Lord your God is God of Gods, which regardeth not perſons, Deut.</hi> 10. 17. But <hi>S.

So ſaith Saint <hi>James, who ſoever ſhall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all: James</hi> 2. 10. The reaſon is, becauſe he that can deſpiſe the authority of the Law-giver, by a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry breach or violation of any one of his commandments, cannot obſerve the reſt out of duty or obedience: for the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority commanding all, requires the ſame duty and obedience to all; And therefore he that willfully rejects but one, embraceth the reſt more out of <hi>conveniency</hi> then out of <hi>conſcience,</hi> more for his own then for Gods ſake, more for his ſelf-intereſt then or his Saviours glory.</p>

                           <p>THE certainty that is in true Chriſtianity, or the ſtate thereof, is wholly from the word and Spirit of Chriſt; the uncertainty is wholly from our ſelves; For what ſhall we be ſure of, if not of our Religion? What certainty can we have but of truth? What truth can we have ſo certain, as the truth of Chriſtian Religion? grounded upon the word of truth, and teſtified by the ſpirit of truth? Therefore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſtate of true Chriſtianity cannot be capable of any doubt in it ſelf, but only in regard of us that profeſs to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> of <hi>a full aſſurance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in the knowledge of Chriſt, Coloſſians</hi> 2. 2: And Chriſtian faith is in its own nature more ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then any humane ſcience whatſoever, though in us, it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hath a leſs proportion of certainty: For Faith <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> looks wholly on Gods infallibility, though <hi>in us</hi> it partake of, and ſympathize with mans infirmity: Therefore the doubt, the uncertainty is not in the <hi>Religion,</hi> but in the <hi>profeſſor</hi> of it; Tis not in the <hi>thing</hi> but in the <hi>perſon;</hi> as for example, tis without all doubt that true Chriſtianity is to love Chriſt, the doubt is only whether we that are Chriſtians do truly love him.</p>

A third doubting there is that proceedeth from piety, becauſe of aſtoniſhment and admiration, which makes a man to ſeem to doubt what he doth moſt ſtedfaſtly believe,</hi> (And ſuch a doubting we read of in the bleſſed Virgin, <hi>Then ſaid</hi> Mary <hi>unto the Angel, How ſhall this thing be, ſeeing I know not a man? Luke</hi> 1. 34.) I anſwer then according to this diſtinction; Firſt, If the doubt concerning our being in the ſtate of true Chriſtianity, proceed from piety or admiration, it is exceeding commendable, we have an excellent preſident for it, the man after Gods own heart, who twice ſpoke theſe words from Gods own mouth, for ſurely with his ſpirit, <hi>What is man that thou haſt ſuch reſpect unto him, or the ſon of man that thou ſo regardeſt him? Pſalm</hi> 8. 4. and 144. 3. Nor is it poſſible for any one that hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Spirit of God, when he conſiders the immenſity of Gods goodneſs and of his own unworthineſs, not to make this doubt of admiration unto his own ſoul, <hi>What is man!</hi> what am I, a ſinful man in my perſon, that thou haſt ſuch reſpect unto me? or <hi>What is the ſon of man!</hi> what am I, a ſinful man in my nature, that thou ſo regardeſt me?</p>
                           <p>Secondly, If the doubt concerning our being in the ſtate of true Chriſtianity, proceed from infirmity, it is at all times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, becauſe though <hi>the ſpirit be willing yet the fleſh is weak; (Mat.</hi> 26. 41.) and at ſometimes almoſt commendable, when either by our omiſſions of piety we have <hi>quenched,</hi> or by our commiſſions of impiety we have <hi>grieved the Holy Spirit of God, whereby we are ſealed to the day of redemption;</hi> In this caſe of ſpiritual leproſie, Gods anſwer to <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning <hi>Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> may be taken as a full determination concerning us; <hi>If her Father had but ſpit in her face, ſhould ſhe not be aſhamed ſeven

This is certainly a ready way not to ſtrengthen our faith, but to weaken it; not to leſſen our doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but to increaſe them: yea to turn our doubtings into diſtreſſes, and our diſtreſſes into deſpair, and our deſpair into damnation.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly and laſtly, if the doubt concerning our being in the ſtate of true Chriſtianity, proceed from infidelity, it is neither commendable nor excuſable in any; nay it is ſo far from being commendable in any, that tis altogether inexcuſable in all: For ſuch a doubt ſuppoſeth not a <hi>weakneſs,</hi> but a <hi>want</hi> of faith, and conſequently ſheweth the man that hath it, to diſtruſt his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, not himſelf, and to remain ſtill in the ſtate of infidelity, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding God calleth him ſo earneſtly to the ſtate of faith: Wherefore ſince <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, (Heb.</hi> 11. 6.) ſuch a doubting of infidelity muſt needs leave him that hath it, under Gods moſt heavy and more juſt diſpleaſure; under his moſt heavy diſpleaſure, becauſe he embraceth not reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when it is offered; &amp; under his moſt juſt diſpleaſure, becauſe he believeth not him that offereth it.

This is the moſt miſerable cheat of all cheats, <hi>to deceive our own ſouls,</hi> and cheat our ſelves of our ſalvation; And this we ſhall do if we be only hearers of the word, as it is a promiſe to ſtrengthen our ſaith; and not alſo doers of it, as it is a precept to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our obedience; For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us plainly, that even the Goſpel, the preaching of Jeſus Chriſt was made known to all nations <hi>for the obedience of faith, Rom.</hi> 16. 25, 26. Not for the aſſent or perſwaſion only, but alſo, and much rather for the obedience of faith.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond Principle of good Chriſtianity is this, <hi>That the true love of Chriſt will make us labour with all our might to keep his words:</hi> For this is <hi>ſubſtantia Chriſtianiſmi,</hi> the very ſubſtance of the Chriſtian Religion; ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is nothing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:114933:199"/>
of the commandments of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 19. as if he had ſaid, External rights and profeſsions are nothing to the Subſtance of Chriſtianity (though to the order of it; they may be much) but the keeping of the commandments of God is all in all; And this is the true touchſtone of the ſoul, to try whether it it be made of droſs, or of purer metal, whether it love God or Mammon, as its chiefeſt good: For he that cares not to thwart Gods will to fulfill his own, is certainly in the ſtate of ſin, and not in the ſtate of Grace: For he loves his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or profit, or preferment better then God, who for his pleaſure, or his profit, or his preferment cares not to break Gods commandments. The Caſuiſts rule is undeniable, <hi>Conſtitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in honore ultimus finis, ſi ob honorem conſequendum non curat quis offendere Deum mortaliter, (Cajet. Sum.</hi>) and again, <hi>Si paratus ſit non curare de praecepto:</hi> He that ſo reſolves upon riches, or honour, or any thing of this world, as to break through a commandment to come by it, is not yet a true lover of God; but loves only himſelf, nay the worſt (though trueſt) part of himſelf, his ſinfull affections; and is not yet a new Creature, becauſe he hath not yet in him faith working by love, to make him ſo: For faith working by love, and a new creature, are one and the ſame thing in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> account, as appears, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. in the former place he tels us, that which availeth in Chriſt Jeſus is <hi>a faith which worketh by love;</hi> in the latter place, that tis <hi>a new creature: For in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion nor uncircumciſion availeth any thing, but faith which worketh by love;</hi> Gal. 5. 6. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature,</hi> Gal. 6. 15. Compare theſe two places of Scripture with that other formerly cited, out of 1 Cor 7. 19. <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is nothing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God,</hi> and you will ſee the <hi>cord,</hi> which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>draws</hi> or <hi>knits</hi> us unto Chriſt, to be <hi>made up of theſe three links, keeping the Commandments of God, A faith which worketh by love; and a new creature:</hi> This three fold cord is not eaſily broken, and cannot poſsibly be untwiſted: In that it is not eaſily broken, it may comfort the good Chriſtian againſt the fear of being a Caſtaway: but in that it cannot poſſibly be untwiſted, it muſt diſtinguiſh him from one that is ſo;
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:114933:199"/>
For he hath not one of theſe truly, that hath them not all three, and he that hath them not all three, (at leaſt in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and and deſire, where he is defective in his practiſe and actual performance) is not yet in Chriſt Jeſus: <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, thaet if one dyed for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. The love of Chriſt is a conſtraining love, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent either of denial or of delay, and the more impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, for fear it ſhould end in a denial: <hi>The love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth, not courteth,</hi> thoſe who are in Chriſt, to live not to themſelves but to their Saviour, by whoſe death they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obtained the life of grace, and by whoſe reſurrection from death, they hope to obtain the life of glory.</p>
                           <p>The third principle of good Chriſtianity, is this, <hi>That true faith in Chriſt was never yet without true love of Chriſt;</hi> And this much we have learned from our Saviours own mouth, who when he was asked a queſtion that concerned faith, returned his anſwer concerning love: For ſo we find S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

But our Saviours anſwer is this, <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my words,</hi> v. 23. The queſtion was made concerning the manifeſtation of Chriſt unto the ſoul, which is by faith: but the anſwer was only concerning love: and ſince our Saviours anſwer may not be thought impertinent, or improper, we muſt conclude that <hi>true faith in Chriſt cannot be without true love;</hi> wherefore the Solifidian muſt either ſay, That he may have true faith without Chriſts manifeſting himſelf unto his Soul; or ſhew, that Chriſt hath manifeſted himſelf unto his Soul, by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him and keeping his words: Saint <hi>Jude</hi> himſelf thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood our Saviours anſwer, and thus in effect explaineth it (in his Epiſtle) for our better underſtanding: ſaying thus, <hi>But ye beloved, building up your ſelves on your moſt holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> v. 20. There's Chriſt manifeſted unto the ſoul by faith; a moſt pious faith, for tis praying; a moſt holy faith, for tis praying in the Holy Ghoſt: not deſpiſing, much leſs deſtroying either the houſe, or the exerciſe of prayer: and again, <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:114933:200"/>
looking for the mercy of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to eternal life,</hi> v. 21. There's that holy faith ſhewing it ſelf by love, teaching a man to forſake all things elſe, to gain Chriſts love, and to forſake himſelf, to keep it, not looking after that fading life which he hath in himſelf, but after that eternal life which he hath in Chriſt: There is in man a two fold manifeſtation, and a twofold love: for either we are manifeſted unto our ſelves, and love our ſelves; or Chriſt is manifeſted unto us, and we love our Saviour; <hi>For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil, 1 John</hi> 3. 8. He was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in his own own fleſh to deſtroy ſin: and for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is he alſo manifeſted in our ſpirits; and accordingly till he be there manifeſted, we are ſo far from deſtroying ſin, that we wholly delight in it: For as long as we are manifeſtd to our ſelves, our love is wholly of our ſelves, either of our pleaſures, to <hi>defile the fleſh, deſpiſe dominion, and ſpeak evill of dignities, (ver.</hi> 8.) ſuch a licentiouſneſs as hates to be controuled, and much more to be confined, and therefore hates the dominion and dignities which God hath ordained to controul and to confine it; Or we are lovers of our profits (as in <hi>ver. 11.) They have gon in the way of</hi> Cain, <hi>and ran greedily after the error of</hi> Balaam, <hi>for reward; and periſhed in the gain ſaying of</hi> Core; where <hi>Balaam,</hi> though put in the Second place, yet is clearly the <hi>firſt mover</hi> in the way of unrighteouſneſs: for <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Core</hi> both do homage unto him: For <hi>Cain</hi> is ready to kill, and <hi>Core</hi> is ready to rebell, if <hi>Balaam</hi> once run greedily after reward: Such are we whiles we are manifeſted to our ſelves, even lovers of our ſelves, <hi>in our pleaſures,</hi> to all abominable licentiouſneſs, <hi>in our profits</hi> to all abominable out-rages; and ſuch are the curſed effects of our ſelf-love, even murders and ſeditions: So that in truth we are ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haters whiles we are ſelf-lovers: for we have our woe denounced againſt us, <hi>Woe unto them</hi> (v. 11.) <hi>Praedicit eorum exitium, quoniam Cainum impudenti malitia, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laamum turpi avaritia, Core d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Core in his factious and ambitious unrulineſs,</hi> But if Chriſt be manifeſted unto us, our love is wholly of him, and we will never think that we can ſufficiently expreſs that love. We will labour <hi>to build up our ſelves in our moſt holy faith,</hi> delighting in thoſe things that are for <hi>Edification,</hi> not for <hi>deſtruction,</hi> and being afraid of that faith which is more for pulling down then for ſeeting up of holineſs; for we may not ſo build up our ſelves, as to throw down others: <hi>Praying in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> that is, praying in ſuch a manner as that he may pray in us, and in ſuch a form as that he may pray with us, not pinning thoſe prayers upon the ſpirit of God, which a ſober man would be aſhamed to ſpeak, and a conſcientious man muſt be afraid to hear: <hi>Keeping our ſelves in the love of God,</hi> and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving whatſoever may be a means to keep us in his love, as his word becauſe it inſtructs us, his authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it reſtrains us, his ordinances becauſe they confirm and ſtrengthen us; having our eyes and our hearts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lifted up to heaven, <hi>looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life;</hi> This is the only way to be aſſured that Chriſt is manifeſted unto our ſouls, if indeed we thus entirely love him; For our faith makes us accepted in Chriſt, not ſo much from the ſtrength of its perſwaſion, as from the ſincerity of its affection; and is therefore called by Saint <hi>Paul, <gap reason="foreign">

                                 </gap>, a faith which worketh by love, Gal.</hi> 5. 16. There is no <hi>moral certainty</hi> to others of our being in Chriſt without this love: <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt and the children of the devill: whoſoever loveth not righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother: 1 Iohn.</hi> 3. 10. There can be no <hi>theological certainty</hi> to our ſelves of being in Chriſt without this ſame love, as it follows v. 14. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from death unto life, becauſe we love the brethren:</hi> He that <hi>loveth not his brother abideth in death:</hi> And again, cap. 4. v. 13. <hi>Hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his ſpirit, and ſure we are that ſpirit is the</hi> Spirit of love.</p>

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:114933:201"/>
alſo in the ſcales of right reaſon: For man naturally doth love God above his life, and doth deſire communion where he loveth, and doth exceedingly delight in the continuance of that communion; So that the comfort which ariſeth from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our being in the ſtate of true Chriſtianity, conſiſts of theſe three degrees: 1. That we are thereby aſſured of the love of God: 2. That we are thereby aſſured of communion with God: 3. That we are thereby (on Gods part) aſſured of the continuance of that communion: which muſt needs bring heaven down to us, if not carry us up to heaven.</p>
                           <p>The firſt degree of this comfort is that we are aſſured of the Love of God, <hi>in whoſe preſence is the fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand there is pleaſure for evermore, Pſal.</hi> 16. 12. For God is not as man that he ſhould be changeable in his love, but his love is like himſelf, without beginning or ending: He loves not more or leſs in proceſs of time, as men do; and if he did, we ſhould have but ſmall comfort of his love. For love that is in time, is but for a time, &amp; not for all times, it will be ſure to chooſe the beſt time; If Gods love were ſuch, woe would be to us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom are come the laſt and the worſt times of this wicked world, and therefore the laſt becauſe the worſt; The worſt as fartheſt from God, and for that reaſon the laſt, as neereſt their own deſtruction: Were Gods love to have a beginning in ſuch times as theſe, both they and it would quickly have an ending; his love would end; and the times would end, which are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported only by his love, and we ſhould all ſuddenly paſs from a moſt wicked time, to a moſt woefull eternity: We muſt therefore ſay of Gods love to our ſouls what himſelf hath ſaid of it by the mouth of his holy Prophet, <hi>Yea I have loved thee with an everlaſting love, therefore with loving-kindneſs have I drawn thee, Jer.</hi> 31. 3. in that he hath drawn us to himſelf, tis an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he hath loved us with an everlaſting love; wherefore every one whom God hath drawn unto himſelf by the bands of the Chriſtian Religion, is bound to believe that God hath loved him in Chriſt, from all eternity, and will love him to all eternity if he abide in Chriſt, the Son of his love: Thus hath Saint <hi>Paul</hi> joined theſe two titles both together, <hi>beloved of God, called to be Saints, Rom.</hi> 1. 7. taking it for a proof that they were beloved of God, becauſe they were called to be Saints; And yet we may
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:114933:202"/>
ſtill admit the School diſtinction of Gods love <hi>Secundum affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, &amp; Secundum effectum:</hi> not as ſetting forth a new love of God, but only new effects of his former love; For though his love be eternal and alwayes the ſame, yet the effects, the benefits thereof are temporal and various, according to our various tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or diſpoſition to receive them: And particularly, the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his love to our Souls, is in time, and not till ſuch time as we have approved our ſelves to love him: And hence it is that our love to God is reckoned up before Gods love to, us, even that love whereby he loved us in his holy purpoſe of eternity; <hi>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpoſe, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. in which words our love is put before Gods love, not that it is ſo in it ſelf, but that it is ſo in our experience: We muſt love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can know that we are beloved; for though we are called according to his purpoſe before we can love him, yet we muſt love him before we can know that we are called according to his purpoſe. Hence Saint <hi>John</hi> writeth to an honourable Lady, as if ſhe had been elected but then when ſhe walked in the truth; and yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith plainly, <hi>we were elected in Chriſt before the foundations of the world, Eph.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                           <p>And theſe two will very well agree; for we are not Gods elect in the judgement of our own conſciences, till we have uſed all diligence to make ſure our calling and our election: we cannot know that we are elected in Chriſt, till we can find that we are approved in him: Hence <hi>electus in Chriſto,</hi> and <hi>probatus in Chriſto,</hi> are but ſeveral expreſſions of the ſame ſpiritual bleſſing in Chriſt; <hi>Apelles approved in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Rufus elected, or choſen in the Lord, Rom.</hi> 16. 10, 13. ſet forth to us two ſeveral good Chriſtians, but only one true being in Chriſt: for he that is elected in Chriſt, is alſo approved in him: And till he can make good his approbation, he cannot make good his election: whereas on the other ſide, he that can make it appear that he is approved in Chriſt, by being in the ſtate of true Chriſtianity, needs not doubt of his being elected in him: for knowing that he loves his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, he ſhall much more know that his Saviour firſt loved him: ſince no man can be ſo well aſſured that he loves God, as he muſt be aſſured that God is love for the former aſſurance

II.</hi> The ſecond comfort ariſing from the knowledge of our being in the ſtate of true Chriſtianity, is, that we are thereby aſſured of communion with God; the cauſe, the work, and the effects of that communion. The cauſe of it is God; The work of it is contemplation of God, and conſultation with God; The effects of it, that it makes a man live for, to, with, and in God.</head>
                           <p>HE that will truly comfort himſelf in his communion with God, muſt firſt conſider the cauſe of that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then after that the communion it ſelf, and its effects. The cauſe of that communion is only Gods own free grace, and undeſerved goodneſs, in coming unto us, when we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, if not unwilling to come unto him.</p>
                           <p>For all the love that we can poſſibly beſtow upon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and all the obedience that we can poſſibly beſtow upon our love, are not a ſufficient invitation for ſuch a heavenly gueſt to come unto our ſouls, and much leſs a ſufficient enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for him, when he is come: Let us view that <hi>ſcala ſalutis,</hi> that <hi>Jacob's</hi> ladder whereby we climb up to heaven, ſet down, <hi>Rom,</hi> 8. 29, 30. we ſhall find in it five ſeveral ſteps or degrees, and God freely coming unto us in them all; The five ſteps whereby we aſcend up to heaven are theſe: <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition, <hi rend="sup">2</hi> Predeſtination, <hi rend="sup">3</hi> Vocation, <hi rend="sup">4</hi> Juſtification, <hi rend="sup">5</hi> Glorification: <hi>For whom he did <hi rend="sup">1</hi> foreknow, he alſo did <hi rend="sup">2</hi> predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his ſon; whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo <hi rend="sup">3</hi> called: and whom he called, them he alſo <hi rend="sup">4</hi> juſtified, and whom he juſtified, them he alſo <hi rend="sup">5</hi> glorified:</hi> Here are five ſteps in our aſcending up into heaven, &amp; God freely comes to us in every one of them: <hi>He did foreknow,</hi> there he comes to us in the firſt ſtep, that of precognition: <hi>He did predestinate,</hi> there he comes to us in the ſecond ſtep, that of predeſtinacion: <hi>He alſo called,</hi> there he comes to us in the third ſtep, that of vocation: <hi>He alſo justified,</hi> there he comes to us in the fourth ſtep, that of Juſtification: <hi>He alſo glorified,</hi> there he

If God be for us,</hi> (and he is certainly for us whilſt we are for him, 2 <hi>Chron. 15. 2.) who can be againſt us? He that ſpared not his own ſon, but delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things? (Rom.</hi> 8. 31, 32.) Nay rather, how hath he not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given us all things <hi>in him</hi> as <hi>our head?</hi> how will he not give them us <hi>with him,</hi> if we continue ſtill <hi>his members?</hi> We have already all things <hi>in him</hi> by vertue of his merit; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only that we have them <hi>with him</hi> by virtue of his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: God in giving his Son, gives himſelf; in giving himſelf, gives all things; for he is all in all: <hi>Nothing but God can give God to the ſoul of man;</hi> The Father gives the Son, the Father and Son give the Holy Ghoſt: For as the Father did heretofore come to us by the Son: So Father and Son do now come to us by the Holy Ghoſt: and do alſo by him make their abode with us: Hence that Apoſtolical benediction, <hi>The grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghoſt, be with you all, Amen, 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 14. The grace is of God the Son, the love is of God the Father, but the communication both of grace and love is of God the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>communicatio Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus Sancti,</hi> (ſaith the Vulgar Latine) <hi>The communication of the holy Spirit be with you all;</hi> For our communion with the Father and with the Son, is by the holy Ghoſt.

                           <p>This communion is heartily deſired, and fully expreſſed by the Pſalmiſt, when he ſaith, <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord, which I will ſeek after; that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple;</hi> Pſalm 27. 4. <hi>Non dicit ſimpliciter potii à Domino, ſed unum petii à Domino, quibus verbis oſtendit ſe prae omnibus bonis, quibus, liceat in hac vita frisi, unum hoc extollere, ſi detur pacifice in domo Dei habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare,</hi> ſaith <hi>Muſculus.</hi> He ſaith not ſimply, I have deſired of the Lord, but <hi>one thing have I deſired of the Lord,</hi> whereby he ſheweth, this one thing is to him above all other things, <hi>that he might live peaceably in the houſe of God;</hi> And of this he ſaith,

The face of God is his preſence, that is, <hi>the preſence of his Grace,</hi> for by that alone do we in this life enjoy his communion; His <hi>natural preſence</hi> in our ſouls may be by knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, whereby he makes man know him, and ſo he is preſent with many wicked men, with whom he will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; but his <hi>gracious preſence</hi> is in the will and affections, whereby he makes men love him, and ſo he is preſent only with good men, to whom by this his preſence he doth alſo afford his communion; agreeable to this is Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Doctrine, concerning the inhabitation of God in the ſouls of men, <hi>Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitator quorundam eſt Deus nondum cognoſcentium Deum, ut par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulorum; quorundam vero inhabitator eſt, cognoſcentium &amp; dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentium; quorundam autem inhabitator non eſt, qui ſc. ſunt cognoſcentes &amp; non diligentes, de quibus,</hi> Rom. 1. <hi>Qui quùm Deum cognoviſſent, non ſicut Deum glorificaverunt: (Aug. ad Dardanum.</hi>) God dwels in ſome who know him not, as in regenerated Infants: He dwels in others who know him and love him, as in religious men; but he dwels in none who know him and do not love him: of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, (<hi>Rom. 1. 21.) When they knew God, they glorified him not as God:</hi> He is naturally preſent with thoſe that know him, or elſe they could not know him; but he is graciouſly preſent only with thoſe that love him: Many have found his <hi>gracious</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that knew him not; but none ever found it who loved him not: For love, as it is the cauſe of union, ſo alſo is it the cauſe of communion, which is indeed but a reciprocal or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:114933:204"/>
union: God may be preſent where he doth not dwell, for <hi>whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence? Pſalm</hi> 139. 7. and ſuch a preſence of God is without his communion: But where he is ſo preſent as to make his abode or dwelling, there he hath communion with the ſoul: For this preſence of God is in truth nothing elſe but his communicating of himſelf: <hi>Praeſens autem eſt: in quantum praeſentat ſeu praeſentem facit bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem quae eſt in ipſo, in habitu tantum, ut in parvulis; in affectu tantum, ut in adultis: in habitu, effectu, et intellectu, ut in beatis,</hi> ſaith that excellent Schoolman <hi>Alenſis par. 3. qu.</hi> 61. God is then preſent with the ſoul, when he repreſents unto it his own bleſſedneſs, either in habit or diſpoſition, as in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that know him not, and yet love him: or in deſire or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as to men that know him and love him; or in a habit, deſire, and comprehenſion, as to the bleſſed ſouls that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know and love, but alſo enjoy him.</p>
                           <p>So that according to the degrees of Gods preſence, are alſo the degrees of his communion: where his preſence is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and imperfect, (as in grace,) there his communion is ſo too: where his preſence is compleat and perfect, (as in glory) there ſo alſo is his communion; But it is beſt for us to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the effects of our communion with God, in the preſence of his grace, that ſo we the more may undoubtedly attain to a communion with him in the preſence of his glory.</p>
                           <p>And theſe effects are excellently ſet down in few words by the <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Spirituale bonum Divinum conſiſtit in amicitia inter Deum &amp; hominem, ac per hoc in conſentire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſari, convivere &amp; colloqui cum Deo;</hi> The bleſſing of the ſoul conſiſts in this, that a man hath friendſhip or communion with God, and conſequently that he lives <hi>for him</hi> by conſent, lives <hi>to him</hi> by converſation, lives <hi>with him</hi> by cohabitation, lives <hi>in him</hi> by contentation: I will briefly explain them all, that the good Chriſtian may know his own happineſs, in that he is called to live in this communion, by vertue whereof, Firſt he lives <hi>for God by conſent.

So that we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn his prayer, but we muſt alſo contemn his Sermon: The other taught us by his practice or example, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 42. where
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:114933:205"/>
he made but one ſpeech, yet three prayers, <hi>he prayed the third time ſaying the ſame words, ver.</hi> 44, It was one and the ſame expreſſion of his voice, it was not one and the ſame elevation of his ſoul; therefore he prayed the third time, though he ſpake but his firſt words: We place the gift of prayer in the volubility of our tongues; our Saviour placed it in the groans of his heart; He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thrice in the ſame words; we uſe many words, ſcarce pray at all: It is the heart that <hi>pants</hi> it, not the tongue that <hi>chants</hi> it out, when we truly ſay, <hi>Thy will be done: Conformitas in volito formali</hi> muſt be in all our deſires, where <hi>in volito materiali</hi> cannot be: Here was a conformity of our Saviours will with Gods will in what he deſired formally in his intention, though a ſeeming non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in what he deſired materially in his expreſſion: And ſo it muſt ever be with us; For we are moſt ſure that in this caſe, the <hi>Non Conformiſt</hi> cannot be a good Chriſtian; but the want of conformity is the want of Chriſtianity.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond effect of this communion, is that the good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an lives <hi>to God by converſation.</hi> Tis a pleaſant contemplation of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that local diſtance is no impediment in the Angels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing one with another, or ſpeaking one to the other, becauſe that is a meer intellectual operation: <hi>In loquutione Angelorum nullum impedimentum praeſtat localis diſtantia, quia eſt mere intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectualis operatio; (Aqu. 1. par. qu. 107. art.</hi> 4.) But tis a much more comfortable aſſertion of the Apoſtle, that the diſtance of heaven from earth cannot hinder the converſation of man with God; for ſo much he plainly aſſerteth when he ſaith, <hi>For our converſation is in heaven, for whence alſo we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3. 20. In which words the Apoſtle affordeth us three obſervations concerning the heavenly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of good Chriſtians; 1. that it is nothing elſe but a ſerious ſtudy and exerciſe of Chriſtian piety, in imitation of Chriſt, to whom they are always lifting up their eyes, and their hearts: 2. that they only are true Chriſtians who firmly and conſtantly exerciſe this piety; for they only have true faith in Chriſt, they only have a firm hope of immortality: 3. that we have all two great Motives for this exerciſe; the one is that Chriſt our Saviour, on whom all our hopes rely, and in whom all our joys are fixed, is in heaven; &amp; thefore what have we to do on earth? The other is, that the ſame Chriſt will at the laſt day come from heaven, to judge us according to the works that we have done; therefore if
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:114933:205"/>
we will have a favourable judgement, we muſt have an innocent converſation: Converſation is but a frequent converſion, and requires our often turning to God by our repentance, as we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten turn away from him by our ſins.</p>
                           <p>The third effect of this communion, is, that he lives <hi>with God by cohabitation; I am crucified with Chriſt, nevertheleſs I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, Gal.</hi> 2. 20. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by this loſing his life, did indeed ſave it; had he kept his life in himſelf he might have loſt it, by a temporal, a ſpiritual, an eternal death; for he would have been ſubject to the ſeparation of his body from his ſoul, of his ſoul from grace, and of his ſoul and body from God: But having loſt his life in himſelf, that he might keep it in his Saviour, he keeps it for ever: <hi>He keeps his natural life,</hi> which elſe he could not but loſe; for his diſſolution is not to him <hi>a death,</hi> but only <hi>a change,</hi> making good his <hi>We ſhall all be changed</hi> even before the laſt day: for he had a <hi>change</hi> only, when others had a <hi>death;</hi> Our departure hence if looked upon as a <hi>change,</hi> is our greateſt conſolation, (for it muſt needs be much for the better, becauſe our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſhall thereby put on incorruption, our mortal ſhall put on immortality) But if looked upon as a death, muſt needs be our greateſt horror and confuſion; for that can only tell us of the deſtroying, not of the amending or bettering our preſent ſtate and condition; <hi>He keeps alſo his ſpiritual life,</hi> ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as moreover improving it; His ſoul being more knit and united with grace then before; which is the ſpiritual life, the union of the ſoul with grace; for though we ſuppoſe it the ſame grace, yet the ſoul muſt needs be united to it the more neerly and the more firmly, the longer it abides in the communion of Chriſt, the fountain of grace; But we may well ſuppoſe the good Chriſtian to grow in grace, ſince the Apoſtle ſo adviſeth him, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. and ſay that by communion with his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, his ſoul is united to more and more grace, and that both moſt neerly and moſt firmly; ſo neerly as without a diſtance, ſo firmly as without a diſunion: Laſtly, <hi>He keeps alſo his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life,</hi> by living to and in his Saviour; that is, he preſently enters his claim, that he may keep his right, though he happily ſtay a long time, before he enters poſſeſſion: Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:114933:206"/>
ſaid, <hi>cupio diſſolvi &amp; eſſe cum Chriſto, I deſire to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and to be with Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 1. 23. Tis all one for him to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt; for he did live with Chriſt before his diſſolution, and therefore cannot but live with him after it.</p>
                           <p>The fourth and laſt effect of this communion with God, is, that the good Chriſtian lives <hi>in God by contentation;</hi> Hence it is that the outrages of this world may diſturb or diſcompoſe, but not diſcontent him; For when he is weary of men, he can retire to himſelf; and when he is weary of himſelf, he can retire to his God; And though he be not weary of himſelf, yet he cannot be ſatisfied in himſelf, as long as he is abſent from his God: Therefore he will be alwayes turning to him, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfied with turning till he get within him: <hi>Turn again then unto thy reſt O my ſoul, for the Lord hath rewarded thee; And why? Thou haſt delivered my ſoul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling; I will walk before the Lord in the Land of the living, Pſalm</hi> 116. 7, 8, 9. We have been a long time turning, and we have turned again and again, but ſurely not unto our God, becauſe not unto our reſt; we have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unadviſedly and irreligiouſly, for we have turned away from our peace and from our God; and therefore the more ſhall be our turnings in this ſort, the more will be our troubles; But this holy man turns very adviſedly; for he is ſure to get reſt by his turning: He turns unto God with a deliberate election, becauſe he is ſure in him to find joy and reſt: <hi>Turn unto thy reſt O my ſoul;</hi> he turns unto him with a zealous and a thankful affection, acknowledging his manifold ſpiritual and temporal deliverances; <hi>Thou haſt delivered my ſoul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling:</hi> Laſtly, he turns to him with a firm and a conſtant reſolution, of perſiſting and preſevering in his thankful acknowledgements, <hi>I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Theſe be the effects and fruits of our communion with God, we have a league of friendſhip with him; and that friendſhip makes us more devoted to him then to our ſelves: And hence it comes to paſs <hi>that we live for him by conſent; live to him by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; live with him by cohabitation; live in him by conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>

Therefore there is yet a third comfort ariſing from the knowledge of our being in the ſtate of true Chriſtianity; which is this, that we are thereby aſſured of the continuance of our communion with God, according to that triumphant exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>But thy loving kindneſs and mercy ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me all the dayes of my life, and I will dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever, Pſalm</hi> 23. 6. Did my communion with God depend upon mine own deſerts, I that could not invite him to me, might juſtly fear I ſhould ſoon drive him from me; but
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:114933:207"/>
now that it dependeth upon his mercy and loving kindneſs, I will hope I ſhall never loſe it, though I know I can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it: For what can love do elſe but love? what can good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do but good? What can the fountain of mercy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, but in ſhewing mercy? Therefore though I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtep aſide from him, yet I hope he will not forſake me; for he hath not only a preventing mercy to receive me, but alſo a following mercy to recall me; He came to me when I was out of the way, and will he go from me becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſtantly keep in it? No, <hi>His mercy and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall follow me all the dayes of my life:</hi> For though men do follow, that they may receive; yet God doth follow that he may give, and that he may give pardon among the reſt of his gifts.</p>
                           <p>This is the ground of my confidence, that <hi>I ſhall dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever,</hi> and that he will continue his dwelling in my heart: For God doth not come to men with an intent preſently to leave them; He comes to the devout foul, not as a <hi>gueſt</hi> to lodge for a night, but as a <hi>friend,</hi> or a <hi>lover,</hi> to abide for ever: The Pſalmiſt reckons up four wayes of Gods diſcontinuing his communion with his ſervants; <hi>Ne abſcondas faciem, ne declines in ira, ne dimittas, ne derelinquas, Hide not thy face, turn not away, leave not, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake not, Pſalm</hi> 27. 8, 9. Each of theſe is an <hi>interruption</hi> of Gods communion with us and our communion with him, but none of them is a total <hi>abruption</hi> of it; each of them is a breach, but none of them is a final breach.</p>
                           <p>The firſt breach is expreſſed by the hiding of his face: the ſecond by turning away his face; the third by leaving us; the fourth by forſaking us: But this which is the greateſt of all, is capable of a mitigation; for though he forſake us for a while, yet he will not forſake us for ever. The Pſalmiſt that asks the queſtion, <hi>Will the Lord abſent himſelf for ever, and will he be no more intreated? Is his mercy clean gone for ever, and is his promiſe come utterly to an end for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious, and will he ſhut up his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in diſpleaſure?</hi> Anſwers it negatively, in that he checks himſelf for asking it, ſaying, <hi>It is mine own infirmity, Pſalm</hi> 77. 8, 9, 10.

Thus ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>Jeſus having loved his own, which were in the world, he loved them unto the end, John</hi> 13. 1. If he had not loved them, he would never have come to them; and loving them to the end, how ſhall he depart from them? And leſt we ſhould think this peculiarly ſpoken of the Apoſtles (contrary to that rule of <hi>Rom. 4. 23, 24. Now it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him, but for us alſo to whom it ſhall be imputed;</hi> where we may plainly ſee that the Scripture, though it often is but particular in the occaſion, yet is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes univerſal in the inſtruction,) I ſay, leſt we ſhould think this occaſionally ſpoken of the Apoſtles, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith it alſo Doctrinally of all others, whom God hath been pleaſed to call to his communion, <hi>Who ſhall alſo confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameleſs in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 8.

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:114933:208"/>
of his love, or becauſe we do ſtick to our ſins which he cannot love. For he will not conſtantly abide either with an unfaithful or with an unfruitful ſoul: The unfaithfull ſoul forſakes his communion, the unfrui tfll ſoul forgets it: <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:114933:209"/>
of it; For our Saviour Chriſt is <hi>the ſame yeſterday to day, and for ever, Heb.</hi> 13. 8. and as he is unchangeable in himſelf, ſo he deſires to be found unchangeable in his members; He will have them the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever; And indeed ſo they are, for they do partake of the conſtancy, who were real partakers of the unity in the Chriſtian communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is betwixt Chriſt and his Church: Thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do ſhew forth a kind of immutability or unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by their conſtancy in religion, who truly have communion with Chriſt, in the unity of his Church: For they cannot run a gadding after other mens phanſies who are really eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in their own conſciences: They know they have met with the true Chriſt already, and therefore look not after falſe Chriſts; and regard not them who ſay, <hi>loe he is here, or loe he is there;</hi> They have found him in his Church, and will not look for him in the deſert or in the ſecret chambers; For Chriſt having ſaid to his Church, <hi>Loe I am with you alwayès, even to the end of the world,</hi> would not have us think that we can be with him, if we will not be with his Church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt look for Chriſtian communion in Chriſts Church, though we muſt not look for it only in his Church, but alſo, &amp; much rather in himſelf: For in truth, Chriſt and his Church do make but one true Chriſtian communion; Accordingly it will be neceſſary to conſider this communion, firſt in its authority, for that Chriſt calleth us thereto by his own authority as the head, and the Church calleth us thereto by the authority of Chriſt as his body.</p>
                        <p>After that we ſhall conſider the ſame communion in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; for authority and excellency are reciprocal in Gods commands; He commonly commaning that with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt authority, on which he hath beſtowed the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly, we ſhall conſider the ſame Chriſtian communion in its ſincerity; for in ſpiritual exerciſes or duties of the ſoul, ſuch as is the deſire and practice of this communion, the greateſt part of the excellency conſiſteth in the ſincerity; for God the ſeer and ſearcher, and judge of hearts, accounteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing excellent in his ſervice, but what proceeds from the heart.</p>

whereby he is of the ſame nature with us men, as a Vine is of the ſame nature with its branches. Nor can there be a fitter ſimilitude to expreſs the communion of Chriſt with his Church, then is this of a Vine with its branches: For as a Vine in the winter is without its branches, ſo was Chriſt in his paſſion without his diſciples: <hi>for they all forſook him and fled, Mark</hi> 14. 50. And as a Vine when it is without its branches is without it is beauty; ſo it is ſaid of Chriſt, whiles he was yet without its diſciples, hanging upon his croſs, <hi>He hath no form nor comelineſs; and when we ſhall ſee him there is no beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that we ſhould deſire him, Iſa.</hi> 53. 2.

The fellow-labourers with God (ſpoken of in the ninth verſe) may help under prop the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: but tis only the Vine that can ſuſtain them: And as the branches have all their greeneſs, and growth, and fruit, from the Vine: So hath the Church all its beauty and nouriſhment and increaſe from Chriſt; and as the Vine doth transfuſe its nature, and therewith its vertue into the branches, ſo doth Chriſt communicate to his members his name, whereby they are called Chriſtians, his vertue whereby they are made Chriſtians, nay the very nature and being of his filiation or Son-ſhip, as far as it is communicable, in that he makes them the Sons of God with himſelf, though not by nature, yet by adoption and Grace: Laſtly (which is Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> obſervation) As the branches are the moſt contemptible of all ſorts of wood when they are off from the Vine, but the moſt glorious whiles they are on it: ſo is it with men, whiles they are without Chriſt, they are moſt baſe and contemptible.

That he is the higheſt part in order; for he is neereſt the moſt high, in whom alone men and angels are brought near unto God; For the diſtance betwixt finite and infinite, muſt needs be infinite; The Angels then being finite, no leſs then men, are in the ſame parallel or equi-diſtance from infinity, and cannot be Mediators to bring us unto God: Only he that hath joined finite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in one perſon, can join them together by his mediation. 2. That he is the nobleſt part in perfection, becauſe he alone had the fulneſs of Grace and truth: all others have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him; <hi>and of his fulneſs have all we received, John 1, 16. Quo propinquius eſt receptivum cauſae influenti, eò abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantius recipit;</hi> The neerer that which receives the influence, is to that which gives it, the more plentifully it is ſupplied; thus Aſtronomy teacheth us, that the Moon in its conjunction with the Sun hath in truth more light in it ſelf: though in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, when it is fartheſt from the Sun, it ſeem more enlightned in regard of us; So the Soul of Chriſt received moſt Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was neereſt God the fountain and giver of grace, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined to him in perſon, whereas the ſpirits of the beſt men and Angels are joined to him only in affection; and thoſe are the beſt of either ſort, who are the neereſt God in this conjunction.</p>

we can be to glory in our ſuppoſed ſtrength; for tis but a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſtrength, and that by an unlogicall, much more by an untheological ſuppoſition which we do challenge to our ſelves, without our Saviour; tis a ſuppoſed ſtrength by a <hi>ſupponis quod non eſt ſupponendum;</hi> A man that ſuppoſeth himſelf to have ſtrength from himſelf, ſuppoſeth what is not to be be ſuppoſed logically, becauſe it is againſt reaſon; much more theologically, becauſe it is againſt religion; for he hath ſaid <hi>without me you can do nothing, Sine me nihil poteſtis facere, John 15. 5.

Sine ipſo factum eſt nihil quod factum eſt, without him was not any thing made that was made.</hi> Accordingly Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tells us, that by this ſaying our bleſſed Saviour hath inſtructed the hearts of the humble, and ſtopped the mouths of the proud: <hi>In quo &amp; corda inſtruit humilium, &amp; ora obſtruit ſuperborum.</hi> I had rather be one of the humble to have my heart inſtructed, then one of the proud to have my mouth ſtopped, and will therefore ſay unto my Saviour, <hi>O Lord my ſtrength and my redeemer, Pſal.</hi> 19. 14. Or I will ſay of him, <hi>I take pleaſure in infirmities for Chriſts ſake, for when I am weak then am I ſtrong, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 10. that is, though I am weak in my ſelf, yet I have a ſufficient ſtrength to glory in, and to truſt to, being ſtrong in my Saviour; therefore let me follow Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> humility and ſay, <hi>Moſt gladly will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me, 2 Cor. 12. 9. Power</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted matter of glory in the man who deſireth to rely upon himſelf; But <hi>Weakneſs</hi> is matter of glory in the Chriſtian, who deſireth to rely wholly upon his Saviour: Hence Saint <hi>Bernard, Quis dabit mihi non ſolum infirmari, ſed &amp; deſtitui ac dificere penitus à memet ipſo, ut Domini virtutum virtute ſtabiliar, (Serm. 25. ſuper Cant.</hi>) O that I could be more and more in-<hi>firme</hi> and <hi>defective,</hi> even to a ſwowning fit in my ſelf, that I might be ſtrengthned and revived by his power who is the Lord of power and ſtrength; He comes very neer Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſion <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, <hi>ut tanquam in tabernaculo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitet in me virtus Chriſti, That the power of Chriſt may reſt in me as in a tabernacle,</hi> not for the ſhortneſs of continuance,

or the uncertainty of abode that is in tabernacles, for he could never have too much of Chriſts company; but for the ſlenderneſs of entertainment that was uſed to be in them: for he could never enough bewail his own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to entertain ſuch a heavenly gueſt.</p>
                           <p>But this Communion with Chriſt, as with our Head, will be better underſtood from our Saviours own mouth, who maketh a whole Sermon concerning it in the fore-quoted 15. Chapter of Saint <hi>John,</hi> in the eleven firſt verſes; and we ſhall beſt learn this doctrine by conſidering the chief heads of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; For therein our bleſſed Saviour ſheweth us the nature, the reaſons, the cauſe, and the proofs or evidences of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>The nature of this communion, Abide in me, and I in you, v.</hi> 4. It is that whereby we abide in him, and he in us; as our own Church hath taught us to pray, <hi>That we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us;</hi> we dwell in him by faith believing his promiſes, by love obeying his commands, and by deſire, hungring and thirſting after his preſence; He dwells in us by his ſpirit enlightning our underſtandings that we may believe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming our affections that we may love, and ſatisfying our deſires that we may delight and rejoyce in the preſence of his Grace, till we may be admitted to the preſence of his Glory.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>The reaſons of this communion:</hi> for although his command be enough to compell us, yet he is pleaſed to uſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to perſwade us to have communion with himſelf; And thoſe reaſons are five, whereof four are poſitive arguments, the fift is privative; The firſt poſitive argument why we ſhould communicate with our Saviour, is, our own Sanctification, ſet forth by two words of Purging, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and of cleanſing <hi>v.</hi> 3. by abiding in him we are purged from the guilt, and cleanſed from the pollution of our ſins.</p>
                           <p>The Second poſitive argument why we ſhould communicate with our Saviour, is, our fruitfulneſs in all good works, <hi>ver. 5. He that abideth in me and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit;</hi> that is, fruits of piety and religion towards God; fruits of temperance and ſobriety towards himſelf; fruits of juſtice and charity towards his neighbour; for he is like a tree planted by the water ſide bringing forth at all times and ſeaſons the fruits
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:114933:212"/>
of a holy, a chaſte, and an upright converſation.</p>
                           <p>The third reaſon why we ſhould communicate with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, is, our own contentation, <hi>ver. 7. Ye ſhall ask what you will, and it ſhall be done unto you;</hi> For he that abideth in Chriſt, conformeth his will to the will of Chriſt, and is ſure to obtain what he asketh, becauſe he asketh ſuch things as pleaſe him; according to that excellent prayer of our own Church, <hi>That they may obtain their petitions, make them to ask ſuch things as ſhall pleaſe thee:</hi> (Collect for 10. Sunday after Trin.) So Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gloſſeth the words, <hi>Manendo quippe in Chriſto, quid velle poſſunt niſi quod convenit Chriſto? quid velle poſſunt manendo in ſalvatore, niſi quod alienum non eſt à ſalute?</hi> He that abideth in Chriſt, what can he ask againſt Chriſt? He that abideth in his Saviour, what can he ask that is deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of ſalvation? Therefore if he beg any thing of God that is not granted him, he begs it as he is in himſelf, not as he is in his Saviour; ſo the ſame Father, <hi>Quia ſi hoc petimus quod non fit, non hoe petimus quod habet manſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>o in Chriſto, ſed quod ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet cupiditas aut infirmitas carnis;</hi> If we ask that which God will not do for us, we ask not according to our being and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Chriſt, but according to our being and abiding in our own fleſhly luſts and infirmities: Wherefore this being a certain truth, that the good Chriſtian deſires to live rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of Chriſt, then his own will; he can never be diſcontented for whatſoever befals him, becauſe he knows, that though God hear him not according to his prayer, yet he heareth him according to his profit; <hi>ſi non audit ad volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, audit ad utilitatem,</hi> as ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and being perſwaded that <hi>all things work together for good to them that love God, (Rom.</hi> 8. 28.) he reſolves to be thankful for what God gives him, and for what he denies him and, <hi>he that reſolves to be thankfull, is ſure not to be miſerable.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The fourth reaſon why we ſhould communicate with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, is Gods glory; <hi>ver. 8. Herein is my father glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ye bear much fruit;</hi> which is agreeable with that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in his firſt Sermon upon the Mount; <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven, Mat.</hi> 5. 16. An argument ſo powerfull, that we may call it <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> or <hi>violentum,</hi> becauſe it offereth
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:114933:213"/>
force or violence to our conſciences, which cannot but tell us that unleſs we do glorifie our God here, we may not hope to be glorified by him hereafter.</p>
                           <p>The fifth reaſon why we ſhould communicate with our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, is rather privative, then poſitive, becauſe it is taken from the puniſhment of thoſe who are not in his communion; and that reaſon is urged in the ſixth ver. <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch, and is withered, and men gather them, and caſt them into the fire, and they are burned:</hi> Where the puniſhment of thoſe who abide not in Chriſt, is the ſame which thoſe endure that are in hell; For it is a puniſhment of loſs, and a puniſhment of ſenſe; The puniſhment of loſs is twofold, 1. The loſs of glory, <hi>he is caſt forth;</hi> 2. The loſs of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>he is withered;</hi> The puniſhment of ſenſe is alſo twofold; 1. He is confined to ill company, <hi>men gather them,</hi> he is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together with other branches as rotten as himſelf; he can have no other company but of wicked men and of evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; which we cannot but ſee, in our late outrages, was a moſt unſufferable miſcheif; and if it be ſo tedious for an hour, what is it for ever? 2 He is caſt into a place of torment to be there tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; <hi>and caſt them into the fire, and they are burned;</hi> Hence Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> moſt excellently, <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num è duobus Palmiti congruit; aut vitis aut ignis; ſi in vite non eſt, in igne erit; ut ergo in igne non ſit, maneat in vite;</hi> One of thoſe two things muſt needs befall every branch, either he is in the Vine, or he is in the fire; therefore that he may not be in the fire, he were beſt abide in the Vine.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly the cauſe of this communion, <hi>ver. 9. As the Father hath loved me, ſo I have loved you; continue ye in my love:</hi> Gods love to us in Chriſt is the firſt efficient cauſe of our communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, even as his grace is the ſecundary or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe of it; and Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath found that alſo in theſe words, <hi>manete in dilectione mea, id eſt, in gratia mea,</hi> ſaith he; continue ye in my love, that is in my grace: He that is an enemy to the grace of God, is not yet fitted for communion with Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly and laſtly, our bleſſed Saviour ſheweth the proofs or evidences of our communion with him, that we may rejoyce when we have it, and repent when we have it not; and thoſe proofs are three.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="385" facs="tcp:114933:213"/>The firſt proof of our communion with Chriſt is this, that Chriſts words abide in us, <hi>ver. 7. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you,</hi> the one alwayes accompanies the other; ſo that thoſe men give an ill proof of their communion with Chriſt, who make it their buſineſs to revile and reproach his word: <hi>Tunc dicenda ſunt verba ejus in nobis manere, quando facimus qua praecepit, &amp; diligimus que promiſit,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Then is it to be ſaid that his words do abide in us, when we do what he hath commanded, and deſire what he hath promiſed; But <hi>Aquinas</hi> tells us that <hi>Chriſts words do abide in us when we believe them, when we love them, when we conſider them, and when we obey them, Amando, credendo, meditando, &amp; implen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do;</hi> And he proves this his Expoſition from <hi>Prov. 4. 20 21. My ſon attend to my words,</hi> that you may believe them; <hi>Encline thine ear unto my ſayings,</hi> that you may obey and fulfill them: <hi>Let them not depart from thine eyes,</hi> that you may conſider and meditate upon them; <hi>Keep them in the midſt of thine heart,</hi> that you may entirely affect and love them: If the words of Chriſt do thus abide in us by faith, by love, by meditation and by obedience, then we have a ſure token that we our ſelves do abide in him; ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Bern. (Serm. 69. ſuper. Cantic.) Si ſenſero aperiri mihi ſenſum, ut intellig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The ſecond proof of our communion with Chriſt, is this, that we continue and abide in his love; and this is a conſequent of the former, as it is ſaid, <hi>ver. 10. If ye keep my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ye ſhall abide in my love:</hi> No keeping of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, no abiding in his love: Wherefore the <hi>Solifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> is in a dangerous condition, who ſeeks not to joyn obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his faith; For he abides not in the love of Chriſt; and how then can he expect that Chriſt ſhould interpoſe his death and paſſion betwixt the judgement of God and his ſinful ſoul, ſince
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:114933:214"/>
that interpoſition is clearly the greateſt effect that can be of Chriſts love? <hi>Greater love hath no man, then this, that a man lay down his life for his friends, John</hi> 15. 13. Our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour dyed for his enemies; but none ſhall have the benefit of his death, in the day of Judgement, but only his friends; and none are his friends but they that abide in his love; and none abide in his love, but they that keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if not by their righteouſneſs, yet at leaſt by their repentance.</p>
                           <p>The third proof of our communion with Chriſt, is this, that his joy remaineth in us, <hi>ver. 11. Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, (ſc.</hi> the things that belong to your abiding in me) <hi>that my joy might remain in you; and that your joy might be full;</hi> Lord, what a mercy is it that thy joy doth come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, much more that it doth remain in us?

This is the very joy of the Holy Ghoſt, a joy not heard of but amongſt Chriſtian, a joy not found but amongſt good Chriſtians, who have <hi>the Spirit of Chriſt witneſſing with their ſpirits that they are the children of God; and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joynt-heirs with Chriſt; if ſo be that they ſuffer with him, that they may be alſo glorified together: Rom.</hi> 8. 16, 17. Tis not all the loſſes of the earth can diſcourage thoſe who are the heirs of heaven; tis not all the ſufferings of this world can diſmay thoſe who have the joy of the next world, becauſe they know they can be loſers and ſufferers only for a time, but they are ſure they ſhall have gain and glory for ever.</p>

or for curioſity, or for ſome other external conſideration, then is our communion with Chriſt only external, and we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do help to make up that viſible body, whereof man is the Head: But if our participation of Chriſt be internal, as is that of good Chriſtians, who hear his Word and receive his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of conſcience, that they may hear him ſpeaking to them in his Word, and find him nouriſhing them in his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then is our communion with Chriſt not only external, but alſo and much rather internal, and we do help make up that myſtical body, whereof Chriſt alone is the Head: <hi>For tis our heart makes our Head, as we are Chriſtians:</hi> if our heart be with man more then with God in our religion, then man is our head in it; but if our heart be with Chriſt, more then with man in our religion, then Chriſt is our Head in it: And hence it comes to paſs, that ſome men are better Chriſtians under a more corrupt, then others are under a more incorrupt form of doctrine and diſcipline; becauſe it is not communion with the Church, but with Chriſt in the Church, that makes the good Chriſtian: He that looks more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, then after his Church in the profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may haply be a good; Chriſtian in a bad Church; for Chriſt is able to make him a good Chriſtian without his Church; nay indeed againſt it: He that looks more after his Church then after Chriſt, muſt needs be a bad Chriſtian in a good Church; for his Church cannot make him a good Chriſtian without Chriſt. Accordingly a man may be a better Chriſtian in an unreformed Church, if his religion be above his faction, then in a reformed Church, if his faction be above his religion; and I had much rather have a Chriſtian mind in an unchriſtian or antichriſtian Church, then an unchriſtian mind in the pureſt Chriſtian Church that is: For though Chriſt be never ſo much in my Church, yet that will do me no good, unleſs he be alſo in my heart; And if Chriſt be in my heart, tis not my Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Antichriſtian or unchriſtian in ſome particulars (which I do lament, but cannot help) that can drive him out of it, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of the ſtate and comfort of true Chriſtianity: Tis ſin if Chriſt be not in mine heart, whiles I profeſs my ſelf to be a Chriſtian: Tis my miſery, if.

Their communion with a bad Church, (when they could not help it) did not hinder their communion with Chriſt; and their communion with Chriſt, did make them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt: <hi>for he was made unto them wiſdom, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to direct them, righteouſneſs to acquit them, ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to purge them, and redemption to ſave them: Thus was Chriſt made unto them either externally in his Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, or internally in his Spirit and graces, accordingly as they did communicate with him, and participate of him: If they brought only an outſide to him, they received only an outſide from him; ſuch a wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and redemption as did only ſhew them to be Chriſtians, not make them good Chriſtians: But if they brought their inner man to Chriſt, he perfected their inner man by an internal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, and participation of his wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption. Wherefore if our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, or participation of Chriſt, be only exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and not alſo internal, we ought to quarrel with our ſelves, not with our Church, and much leſs with our God: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, God is faithful who offers us Chriſt by his Church in his word and Sacraments, (For is the Spirit of the Lord ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? do not his words do good to him that walketh uprightly? <hi>Mich.</hi> 2. 7. is a queſtion as unanſwerable now, as it was then) and it is meerly from our own unfaithfulneſs, if we receive not Chriſt when he is offered, or retein him not when he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>

                           <p>THE union of two extreams, is neceſſarily by ſome other third thing betwixt them both, which brings the ſaid extreams together; and <hi>that,</hi> in regard of Chriſt, is his ſpirit, which brings him down to us; in regard of us, is our faith, which carries us up to Chriſt; Both are alike required in our internal communion with Chriſt: For though his Spirit be never ſo powerfully with his own ordinances, that to reſiſt the one is to reſiſt the other, as ſaith Saint <hi>Stephen, ye ſtiffnecked and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in hearts and ears, ye do alwayes reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, Acts</hi> 7. 51. Yet if our faith be not with his Spirit, we cannot have communion with him in his word; For ſo is the ſame truth ſpoken by anothers mouth, <hi>But the word preached did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it, Heb.</hi> 4. 2. Their not being profited was not for want of Gods Spirit with his word, but for want of their faith with Gods Spirit: The ſpirit was not, is not wanting to the word; for <hi>the word of God is quick and powerful, ſharper then any two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſword, peircing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and is a diſcoverer of the thoughts and intents of the heart, ver.</hi> 12. All which force and activity cannot be from the dead letter which conſtitutes the word, but from the quick ſpirit which accompanies and enlivens it; But their faith was, and our faith is wanting to the Spirit of God, which brings us all under that ſharp reproof of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>O fools and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken! Luke</hi> 24. 25. For if we be not ſlow to believe, yet generally we believe by an hiſtorical faith proceeding from
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:114933:217"/>
the conviction of the underſtanding meerly through the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth, (as the Devils believe and tremble) not by a juſtifying faith, proceeding from the converſion of the will through the love of truth: And hence it is, that though the cheif corner ſtone be rightly laid in all Chriſtian Churches, all alike confeſſing Chriſt to be the eternal Son of God, and the Mediator betwixt God and man; (for if any deny this, they are neither to be thought, nor to be called Chriſtians) yet the building is not rightly raiſed in many Churches; the reaſon is, becauſe there be <hi>many mockers in theſe laſt times, who walk after their own ungodly lusts, ſeparating themſelves, ſenſual, not having the Spirit, as</hi> Saint <hi>Jude</hi> admoniſheth; But in no wiſe <hi>building up themſelves in their moſt holy faith, or praying in the Holy Ghoſt, or keeping themſelves in the love of God,</hi> as Saint <hi>Jude</hi> adviſeth. No wonder if ſuch a faith as this came far ſhort of its proper object, <hi>Chriſt with all the bleſſings and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God,</hi> ſince indeed it comes far ſhort of it ſelf; For a faith that maketh men not build up but pull down the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of religion; and pray, not in Gods Holy Spirit, but in their own perverſe ſpirits, and keep themſelves not in the love of God, and conſequently of his Church, but in the love of their own ſelf-intereſts and advantages; ſuch a faith, or rather ſuch a phanſie or fiction, and faction as this is and muſt be called, comes far ſhort of faith, and therefore cannot but come far ſhort of Chriſt the proper object of faith.</p>
                           <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of another kind of faith, which to them under the Law was <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> and muſt be ſo to us under the Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>theſe all died in faith, not having received the promiſes, but having ſeen them afar off, and were perſwaded of them, and embraced them, and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth, Heb.</hi> 11. 13.

they confeſſed the ſame promiſes not only in their words but alſo in their deeds, in their life and converſation, accounting themſelves ſtrangers and Pilgrims on earth, when they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered thoſe heavenly promiſes: And that made them like Pilgrims earneſtly to long after their own country, and not do or deſire any thing for love of earth, which might hinder or delay their paſſage to heaven: So that a faith thus ſeeing, thus applying, thus approving, thus confeſſing the promiſes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt, is the faith which our Apoſtle defineth to be the <hi>ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> that is to ſay, a faith that now maketh Chriſt preſent with the ſoul by the communion of his grace, and will hereafter make the ſoul preſent with Chriſt in the communion of his glory: Oh for ſuch a faith to bring my Saviour into my ſoul, and to keep him there, till faith it ſelf be no longer faith, but be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into viſion! A faith that engageth the whole man, in all his powers and faculties both of ſoul and body; For only ſuch a faith as taketh up the whole man, in his underſtanding, will, affections, actions, can take a right and lay a faſt hold on Chriſt; ſuch a faith, though it cannot miraculouſly now open the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, as it did once to Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> yet it can and will pierce the heavens, and there ſee the ſon of man ſtanding on the right hand of God, ready to defend us on earth, and as ready to receive us into heaven.</p>
                           <p>Whence we may very well conclude, that this communion of good Chriſtians with Chriſt, or of the body with the head, though at ſo great a diſtance, is in the thing it ſelf moſt real and ſubſtantial, though in the manner it be only ſpiritual and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical. Chriſt and his Church, (nay every true member of his Church) are as ſubſtantially united together, as man and wife; <hi>Husbands love your wives, as Chriſt loved the Church, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25. that is to ſay, his wife: And therefore as no diſtance can keep the man and his wife from being one fleſh; ſo neither Chriſt and his Church from being one ſpirit: <hi>He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 17. And to put us out of doubt that we whilſt we live here on earth, if we live unto him, are thus joyned unto him, Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith plainly, <hi>Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the ſpirit which he hath given us. 1 John</hi> 3. 24.

union then is of the ſoul with the body, becauſe the ſoul abideth in the body; and the ſame union is of Chriſt with the ſoul, becauſe he abideth in the ſoul; and as we know the ſoul abideth in the body by the ſpirit or breath which it giveth to the body; ſo we know that Chriſt abideth in the ſoul, by the ſpirit which he giveth to the ſoul; Yet is this union of Chriſt with his body, not carnal but ſpiritual, not to be diſcerned by the ſtrength of the outer, but of the inner man; ſuch an union as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribeth to all, but wiſheth only to good Chriſtians, (for though he might wiſh the Son of righteouſneſs to ſhine upon a dunghill, yet he might not wiſh him to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it) <hi>that God would grant you to be ſtrengthned with might by his ſpirit in the inner man, that Chriſt may dwell in your heart by faith, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 16, 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here is a moſt real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial union and communion betwixt Chriſt and good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; for the ſpirit ſtrengtheneth them, and Chriſt dwelleth in them; but tis only <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> for the ſpirit ſtrengtheneth their inner man; and <hi>myſtical,</hi> for Chriſt dwelleth in their hearts: And he dwelleth in their hearts by faith, not a faith that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from their own Spirits, but a faith that commeth from Gods Spirit; A faith that cometh from our own ſpirits ſtrengthneth only the outer man; but a faith that cometh from Gods ſpirit ſtrengthneth the inner man: That faith is ſtrong only in perſwaſion, but this faith is ſtrong in affection; That faith is ſtrong in phanſie, but this faith is ſtrong in love, even in that love which is the fulfilling of the Law; loving the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the heads ſake, loving the head for his own ſake: lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Church for Chriſt, and loving Chriſt for himſelf; ſuch a faith as this proceeding from the Spirit of God, cannot but afford us a real communion with the Son of God; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a real communion with Chriſt as with our head, we ſhall never delight in ſeparations and diviſions from the Church, which is his body.</p>

                           <p>TRue Chriſtian communion beginneth with the Church, as with the body of Chriſt, but endeth with Chriſt himſelf, as with the head: God hath joyned thoſe two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let not man put them aſunder; Nor is it the intent of this diſcourſe to divide this Chriſtian communion into two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral communions, <hi>by reaſon determining or defining, ratione ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinata,</hi> becauſe the body cannot ſubſiſt without the head, but only <hi>by reaſon diſcuſſing or debating, ratione ratiocinante,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the head is different from the body: And every good Chriſtian is to take notice, that though he may conſider this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſeverally, yet he may not perſue and embrace it ſo. For he cannot have actual communion with Chriſt, unleſs he have actual communion with his Church, no more then he can have communion with the head, unleſs he have alſo communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the body: yet may he not reſt ſatisfied in his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the body, the Church of Chriſt, till they come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to have communion with the head, even with Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                           <p>For our Chriſtian communion is much like <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder, the lower part whereof was ſet upon the earth, but the top of it reached up to heaven; And behold the Lord ſtood above at the top of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 12, 13. So is our Chriſtian communion; The lower part of it is with the Church the body of Chriſt here on earth: but the upper part or top of it, is with Chriſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And we cannot ſay that our Chriſtian communion is a
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:114933:219"/>
true communion, unleſs Chriſt be at the end of it; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in hearing the word (read and preached) we at firſt communicate with the Church, which ſpeaketh to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, but we hear it not profitably to our ſalvation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we at laſt communicate alſo with Chriſt, ſpeaking by his Spirit unto our ſouls, or to the inward man; <hi>Paedogogus est Jeſus,</hi> Our teacher is Jeſus, was thought by <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a fit ſubject both to fill and to name his books of Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions (<hi>v. lib. 1.

For as the Church teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the people, ſo alſo Chriſt teacheth them much more: and the Churches paedagogy i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> or ſhould be to bring them unto Chriſt, not to make them reſt only upon their own teaching for ſoul-ſaving truths: nor is this Doctrine any diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Church, no more then Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> was to the Law, when he ſaid, <hi>The Law was our School-Maſter to bring us unto Christ, Gal.</hi> 3. 24. Nay indeed it is the greateſt honour of the Church, (as it was of the Law,) that God is pleaſed to uſe her teaching as a means or inſtrument to bring us unto Chriſt; That as the Church teacheth us by explaining ſaving truths to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, ſo Chriſt may teach us by imprinting the ſame truths in our wills and affections, &amp; therefore the Church ſhould above all things, take heed of offering thoſe truths in her expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which ſhe cannot believe, nor wiſh that Chriſt ſhould ratifie by his impreſſions, ſuch as are all thoſe Doctrines which are the inventions of men, and not the inſtitutions of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>And foraſmuch as it cannot be denied that Chriſt teacheth more powerfully by his own word then by ours, it is evident that the Holy Scriptures may not be denied to the people in their own tongue by that Church which will labour to advance their communion with Chriſt; and as evident, that the people are not bound to communicate with that Church which will not labour to advance this, the higheſt and greateſt part of their Chriſtian communion: Again, in receiving the holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> we muſt not only communicate with the Prieſt exhibiting unto us the bread and wine, but alſo, and much rather, with Chriſt himſelf exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto us his moſt precious body &amp; blood, or we ſhall receive but half a Sacrament, and enjoy but a half communion: This is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Divinity; <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? The bread which
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:114933:219"/>
we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? 1 Co.</hi> 10. 16. We bleſs the Cup, and we break the bread; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt communicate with us, (which we could not ſay, if we did refuſe to do either; for we could not deſire you to relinquiſh your communion with Chriſts inſtitution, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ours;) But the Cup which we bleſs, and the bread which we break, is the communion of the blood and body of Chriſt; therefore you muſt not communicate chiefly, and much leſs only with us, but alſo and much rather with Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, Thus is it alſo in our prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are bound in our praying to communicate not only with the Church as the body, but alſo with Chriſt as the head; and conſequently the Church is bound to uſe no other prayers then ſuch as may be agreeable with Chriſts communion, and available by Chriſts interceſſion: For if we pray out of his communion, we cannot hope to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what we pray for, by virtue of his interceſſion: And this (I conceive) was one main reaſon why publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies were at firſt eſtabliſhed in the Church, that Chriſtians might know before hand the terms of their communion, and be aſſured in their own hearts, that no other prayers ſhould be offered unto them, then ſuch wherein Chriſt himſelf would joyn with them in interceſſion, which aſſurance during the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effuſions of the Spirit, was grounded upon the infallibility of their perſons who prayed; but when it could no longer be grounded upon the infallibility of the perſons that prayed, then it was thought fit it ſhould be grounded upon the infallibility of the thing or of the prayer; for that faith cannot reſt but upon infallibility; and the people, as well as the Prieſt, ought to pray in Faith, wherefore this aſſurance is not only very juſt and reaſonable, but alſo very neceſſary and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſince we all know we muſt pray in the merit of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, if we hope our prayers ſhould find admittance to God, and acceptance with him, and we are ſure he will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede with us in ſuch prayers as we have not learned from him. For which cauſe the Church alſo teacheth us to conclude all our prayers after this manner, <hi>Per Jeſum Chriſtum Dominum noſtrum,</hi> through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, as if we were bound to believe that Chriſt then prayeth for us, when we are praying for our ſelves, (according to the rules of his word)
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:114933:220"/>
and that we have hopes to be heard not by virtue of our own, but of his interceſſion: And tis obſervable that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of thoſe who worſhipped Angels, that they <hi>held not the head, (Col.</hi> 2. 19.) becauſe in ſuch worſhip, Chriſt who is the head, could not joyn with them, nor they with him: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> thus expoſtulates with ſuch a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper, <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, (<hi>Can.</hi> 35.) becauſe <hi>ſuch men have forſaken the Lord Jeſus, and are guilty of idolatry:</hi> And it is a pitiful evaſion of <hi>Baronius</hi> to ſay that the Council ſpake of falſe Angels, which the Heathen called <hi>Genii;</hi> for beſides that no Chriſtians ever worſhipped them, and the Canon only concerns Chriſtians, tis too great an abſurdity to be pinned upon a Council, to ſay they ſpake of Angels, when they meant Divels: For our parts, we muſt conclude that praying to Saints and Angels is a very unwarrantable, a very unſafe, a very uncomfortable way of praying, becauſe we are ſure we cannot have communion with Chriſt in ſuch prayers: For though he can, doth, and will join with us in ſaying, <hi>Our Father,</hi> yet he cannot, will not, ſaying, <hi>Our Brother;</hi> Though he doth join with us in our interceſſions to the Creator God bleſſed for ever, yet he doth not, cannot joyn with us in our interceſſions to any creature; And therefore ſince the Church requires our communion only by authority from Chriſt, it is evident that no Church can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require our communion in this or any other practice, wherein it ſelf doth not communicate with Chriſt: For in ſuch prayers as theſe, we can only hold of the body, (or rather
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:114933:220"/>
ſome corrupted member of the body) but we cannot hold of the head; and conſequently in ſuch prayers as theſe, there can be no true Chriſtian communion; for that ſo beginneth with the Church, as that it endeth with Chriſt; ſo beginneth in earth, as that it endeth in heaven; Saint <hi>Johns</hi> determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may beſt decide this controverſie (for ſome mens perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath made it ſo) who in very few words thus ſets forth to us our Chriſtian communion, <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, 1 John</hi> 1. 3. Where we may ſee that God imparted not the knowledge of Chriſtian truths to his Church that ſhe might reſerve them to her ſelf, but that ſhe might pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and declare them to his people: <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, declare we unto you:</hi> God hath declared them to us, that we ſhould declare them to you: And the reaſon why the Church is bound to declare theſe Chriſtian truths to the people, is, to eſtabliſh them in the true Chriſtian communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> where we plainly ſee, that Chriſtian communion begins with the Church, and ends with Chriſt; nor would the Apoſtle ſeek to draw them to have fellowſhip with him, but that with him they might alſo have fellowſhip with Chriſt; he deſires not to magnifie this communion from himſelf, but from his Saviour: He therefore exhorts them to have communion with the Church, that they might have communion with Chriſt: For indeed there are at leaſt two degrees, if not parts, of our Chriſtian communion; the firſt is our communion with Chriſts Church as with the body, <hi>that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us;</hi> The ſecond is our communion with Chriſt himſelf as with the head, <hi>and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and this communion is or ought to be the end of all preaching; <hi>that which we have ſeen and heard, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip, &amp;c.</hi> This is or ſhould be the intent of all preaching; even the communion of the people with the Prieſts, and the communion both of Prieſts and people with Chriſt; ſo likewiſe ſaith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>His Divine power hath given

Not naming this or that particular Church, but taking the whole body of Chriſtian people for the body of Chriſt, or for his Catholick Church: For they are all united together in one communion, and fellowſhip by the ſpirit of Chriſt, even as all the members of the body are united in one communion by the ſoul; So <hi>Aquinas, Sicut in uno homine eſt una anima; &amp; unum corpus, &amp; tamen ſunt diverſa membra ipſius; Ita Eccleſia Catholica eſt unum corpus, &amp; habet diverſa mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra; Anima autem quae hoc corpus vivificat, eſt ſpiritus ſanctus: (in opuſc. de ſymbol.)</hi> As in one man there is but one ſoul and one body, although there be very may ſeveral members, becauſe they are all made one body by vertue of the ſoul which gives life to all; ſo is the Catholick Church but one body, although it conſiſt of divers particular Churches, as of ſo many
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:114933:223"/>
members, becauſe they are all made one body by the ſpirit of God, which quickens and enlivens them all: So that no man can ſay any one particular Church is the Catholick Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding other Chriſtian Churches without confining the ſpirit of God, and diſmembring the body of Chriſt; which is little leſs then damnable blaſphemy againſt the Spirit; for he is infinite and therefore unconfinable; and as damnable Schiſm againſt the Son of God, for he hath made himſelf one with his Church; and therefore to cut off any part of his Church from him, is to cut him off from himſelf: Let me rather rejoice that the ſpirit of God is not to be confined, and the body of Chriſt is not to be diſmembred; for why ſhould my eye be evil becauſe he is good?

what particular Church is now to be reputed moſt Chriſtian or Catholick; I muſt anſwer, that Church wherein Chriſt is beſt taught and practiſed; for we may not ſeparate the practice from the doctrine of Chriſtianity, ſince the doctrine cannot be proved but from the practice, according to that of Saint <hi>John, Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 1 John</hi> 2. 3.

By that alone we prove the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church to be the only Catholick, againſt the miſguided Jew; by that alone we prove this or that particular Church to be more truly Catholick againſt the miſtaken Chriſtian: And this proof Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us in all his Epiſtles, proving out of the Old Teſtament that Chriſt alone was that Prophet who was to come into the world to bring both righteouſneſs and ſalvation; and conſequently that no Religion but only
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:114933:225"/>

And as this abolition of the Ceremonial worſhip was foretold to the Jews at the firſt inſtitution, ſo was it alſo believed by them, at the firſt reception thereof: For hence alone was it, that they found no fault with their Prophets, after <hi>Moſes,</hi> though they found them diſpenſing with the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nay plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acting againſt it in the exerciſe of their typical or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial worſhip; as for example, neither they (of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> nor of <hi>Samaria</hi>) quarrelled with <hi>Eliah</hi> for gathering <hi>Iſrael</hi> together to offer ſacrifice upon Mount <hi>Carmel, 1 King.</hi> 18. 19.

A ſtrange aſſertion, as if God had put all his Divine Truths whether ſpeculative or practical (for if the one, the other alſo) under the poſſibility of mans lawfull contradiction, and all our conſciences under the power of his controul: nor is there any remedy for this miſcheivous conſequence, by tranſlating this pretended Infallibility from his perſon to his chair, nor from his chair to his Church; for we may juſtly ſuppoſe, or rather muſt neceſſarily believe, that Saint <hi>Johns</hi> words are as well to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and interpreted of a whole Church, as of ſingle man, ſince there is the ſame reaſon of both; for a Church is but a congregation of men; and falſe doctrine hath no leſs of falſity, though it hath leſs of excuſe, in a Church, then in any particular man; But we muſt more then believe this Truth, (if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) That the Goſpel is to ſway our faith above and againſt all authorities to the contrary whatſoever, by the force of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> reaſon; For if not the authority of the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, then ſurely not of the Church militant may be allowed to weaken our faith in the doctrine or in the Goſpel of Chriſt; If not an Angel from heaven, then ſure not a man upon the earth.</p>

                           <p>We will then take it for granted that the Catholick Church cannot be fully and infallibly proved to be Chriſtian, but only by the Holy Scriptures, and that ſhe her ſelf ſeeks for no other, and cannot find a better proof; And from hence it muſt neede follow that every particular Church as far as it is truly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,

                           <p>But yet we muſt acknowledge, that the Catholick Church commonly ſo called, is of a larger ſignification then to expreſs, and of a larger extenſion then to comprize only theſe choice and ſelected Chriſtians; For all that outwardly embrace the truth and worſhip of Chriſt, do make but one Catholick Church, for as much as they all concur in the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith in the ſame common Saviour, and in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward uſe of thoſe means of Salvation which he hath appointed, though they neither profeſs the faith ſo incorruptly as it was taught, nor uſe the means ſo inoffenſively as they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And this Divinity, That all Chriſtians are incorporated into one body of Chriſt, or one Catholick Church, hath been taught us by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That he might reconcile both</hi> (Jew and Gentiles) <hi>unto God in one body,</hi> Eph. 2, 16. and again, <hi>That the Gentiles ſhould be of the ſame body, Eph.</hi> 3. 6. that is to ſay, of the ſame body externally by the ſame word and Sacraments, and of the ſame body internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the ſame ſpirit of Chriſt: Wherefore the unity of this body of Chriſtians, as tis a viſible body, is from one thing; and as tis a myſtical body, is from another: For the unity of the <hi>Myſtical body</hi> of Chriſt, is only from the Holy-Ghoſt, joining all the members together, and each particular member to the Head; But the unity of the <hi>viſible body of</hi> Chriſt, is from
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:114933:230"/>
one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, all the members of the Church as tis viſible, being to be diſcerned and known by this character, even by the outward profeſſion of that truth, and by the outward uſe of thoſe means, which Chriſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lord and Saviour hath inſtituted and ordained for their Salvation.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore all men that have the profeſſion of Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving truth, and do practice the means of ſalvation, muſt be acknowledged to belong to one Chriſtian, or to one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, as being ſanctified by the profeſſion of that truth, and the uſe of thoſe means, though their ptofeſſion be not ſo entire, nor their practice ſo exact as it ought to be: Whence the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> though much over run with Hereſie and Schiſm, yet writeth on this manner, <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 2. For in that they were of the Chriſtian Church by the outward profeſſion of Chriſts truth, and the practice of his commands, they were ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, though ſome of them were Hereticks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the reſurrection, others were Schiſmaticks and denied the Apoſtles authority; For even Hereticks and Schiſmaticks though they do not hold in verity and in unity the entire profeſſion of Chriſts Truth, yet are they of the Chriſtian Church generally ſo called, for that truth which they do hold; and as far as they remain parts of the true Chriſtian Church, ſo far they may be a means of ſaving others either by preaching the word or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the Sacraments, though by reaſon of their Hereſie and Schiſm, they themſelves (without repentance,) are not in the ſtate of Salvation; And ſurely we cannot reaſonably think that there were neither Hereticks nor Schiſmaticks in the Churches of <hi>Epheſus, Philippi,</hi> and <hi>Coloſſe;</hi> and yet the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To the Saints which are at Epheſus,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <p>Wherefore it is ſafeſt for men to believe, that though the <hi>promiſes</hi> of grace chiefly concern the <hi>myſtical;</hi> yet the <hi>precepts</hi> chiefly concern the <hi>viſible</hi> Church; for as much as Chriſt hath intruſted that, both with the doctrine and with the means of ſalvation; with the miniſtry both of his Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For theſe are without queſtion depoſited with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, though none are benefited by them, (ſo far as to attain Salvation) but only thoſe that are of the inviſible Church, or the myſtical body of Chriſt: But God the ſearcher of hearts, hath reſerved the knowledge of the inviſible Church only to himſelf, and requireth all Chriſtians to join in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with that viſible Church wherein they live, if ſo be that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <p>For he that willfully lives and dies out of the communion of his own Church, being a true member of the Catholick, lives and dies (at leaſt in the perverſe diſpoſition of his ſoul) out of the communion of the Catholick Church, and conſequently lives and dies in the ſtate of damnation: ſo neerly doth it concern every Chriſtian not to break communion with his own Church unadviſedly and undeſervedly, (for that is in effect to break communion with the Catholick Church) but to try the Spirits whether they are of God, and to know there is no warrantable diſobedience of that command, <hi>Keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace,</hi> unleſs it be evident, <hi>That the Spirit is not of God;</hi> And yet even in that caſe, men ought to be very caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and wary, that they ſo forſake the communion of the Church, as not to diſturb the peace of it; for that was all that thoſe ſeven thouſand did, who bowed not their knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> in the general defection of the Church of <hi>Iſrael, 1 King.</hi> 19. 18.

Tis the Churches part to preach unto us the hope of the Goſpel, or the Doctrine of our being reconciled to God in Chriſt; where this Doctrine is rightly publiſhed, accepted and maintained, there is without doubt a true Chriſtian Church; there is communion with Chriſt; and if he will preſent us holy, unblameable &amp; unreprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his ſight for continuing in this faith grounded and ſetled, we can have <hi>little cauſe,</hi> but <hi>no excuſe,</hi> for leaving that Church whereinis the profeſſion of this faith: for as every particular Chriſtian Church may lawfully preſerve its own liberty againſt the incroachment of other Chuuches, ſo it muſt neceſſarily preſerve its authority againſt the inſolencies of its own people: The caſe is notorious concerning <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> when he went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incenſe upon the Altar of incenſe, that <hi>Azariah</hi> with the Prieſts withſtood him, ſaying, <hi>it pertaineth not to thee</hi> Uzziah <hi>to burn incenſe unto the Lord, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Prieſts the ſons of</hi> Aaron <hi>that are conſecrated to burn incenſe: Go out of the ſanctuary, for thou haſt treſpaſſed, neither ſhall it be for thine honour from the Lord God, 2 Chron.</hi> 27. 17, 18.

                              </gap>: So <hi>Kimchi:</hi> it ſeems by the Text, that officiating in the Prieſts office without being a Prieſt, was a profanation under the Law; and why ſhould we think otherwiſe under the Goſpel, ſince thoſe who now ſucceed them in the adminiſtration of publick worſhip, have obtained a more excellent miniſtry, by how much they are the Mediators of a better Covenant? <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. For thoſe words though ſpoken directly of Chriſt, yet are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably true of the Miniſtry inſtituted by him, who are ſurely
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:114933:234"/>
the Mediators of a better Covenant, &amp; therefore have obtained a more excellent Miniſtry; &amp; conſequently to invade their office, muſt needs be a more dangerous profanation; and we ſee thoſe who are guilty of it, are commonly even to this day, ſtruck as <hi>

For God gave all the authority belonging to the Miniſtry of the New Teſtament, to our Saviour Chriſt, and he gave the ſame to his Apoſtles, with power and command of giving it to others after them to the worlds end; ſo ſaith the Text, <hi>John 20. 24. As my father hath ſent me,</hi> Therrs the authority of the Miniſtry given unto Chriſt, <hi>even ſo I ſend you,</hi> there's the ſame authority given by him to his Apoſtles, not only for themſelves, but alſo for others; for as Chriſt was ſent that he might ſend them, ſo were they ſent that they might ſend others after them. Thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith for himſelf, <hi>According to the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God which was committed to my truſt, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 11.

He that deſpiſeth you that are ſent by me, deſpiſeth me that ſent you; and he that deſpiſeth me that am ſent of my Father, deſpiſeth him that

ſent me; nor may we ſay that our Miniſters are not ſent of God; for <hi>how ſhall they preach except they be ſent,</hi> doth now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as well as then, that if there be no ſending, there can be no preaching: either we muſt ſay that preaching (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently praying and adminiſtring the Sacraments, for there is the ſame reaſon of all) is not Gods work, or that thoſe who lawfully do it, have Gods authority for what they do: And if they have Gods authority, how ſhall they not have my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſaith not only for himſelf and his aſſiſtants, but alſo for all that were to ſucceed him in his Miniſtry, <hi>We were allowed of God to be put in truſt with the Goſpel, 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 4.

They were not to fear mens killing if they did their duty, but Gods killing if they did it not; And leaſt the world ſhould think them hated of God, becauſe they were by him expoſed to all dangers, in another place, (where he ſtill deterreth them from fearfulneſs in diſcharging this truſt,)
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:114933:235"/>
he calleth them his friends, <hi>And I ſay unto you my friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will fore-warn you whom you ſhall fear, fear him that after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell; yea, I ſay unto you fear him, Luke</hi> 12. 4, 5. They are to prefer the diſcharge of their Truſt above their lives, and ſhall not I prefer it above my humour? Shall I think that my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our who hath bid me take him for an heathen or a publican that neglects to hear the Church, will take me for a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian if I my ſelf be guilty of that neglect? (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17.) I will then willingly acknowledge that thoſe only to whom Chriſt hath given the power of looſing and binding in heaven, are, in this reſpect, called the Church (for ſo the ſequele of the context there requires) and that if I hear not theſe, I ſhall be in his account but as a heathen or a publican.</p>
                           <p>For this is the Church which God hath in this Nation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the blood of his Son, with the dictates of his Spirit, and with the ſouls of his People; and I muſt hear this Church as I would have the benefit of his Sons blood, as I would have the inſtructions of his holy Spirit, and as I would not forfeit the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mine own Soul.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore though the whole world turn round to a meer ſpiritual dizineſs, or reel to and fro and ſtagger like a drunken man, yet this ſhall be the ſober reſolution of my ſoul; I will not ſin againſt that authority which God hath ſet over me. He hath called his Miniſters his friends, I will not call them mine enemies leaſt I put my ſelf out of his friendſhip: I find that God the Father, Son and Holy-Ghoſt hath ſet them over me, and how ſhall I anſwer it to this bleſſed Trinity, if I oppoſe my ſelf againſt them, or rather ſet my ſelf over them! Tis St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his obſervation, (<hi>Ath. lib. de communi eſſentiâ Patris, Filii &amp; Sp.

Theſe ſpiritual watch-men were as neceſſary in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time as in <hi>Ezekiels,</hi> and in our times as then; And conſequently they are to us, what the Prophets were to the Jews, or the Apoſtles to the Primitive Chriſtians, ſaving only their extraordinary commiſſion and endowments: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to give warning to the Jews, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was to give warning to the Gentiles for ſo himſelf ſaith, <hi>whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wiſdom, that we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, Col.</hi> 1. 28.

                           <p>Wherefore we cannot deny, but as we ſtill need the <hi>warning,</hi> ſo we ſtill need the <hi>watchmen;</hi> and we muſt confeſs that watchmen of Gods own ſetting up, may not be diſturbed or diſplaced, till himſelf be pleaſed to put them away, or to pull them down; and ſure we are, that will not be till we ſhall no longer need them. And if the watchmen are bound to give the warning, then queſtionleſs the people are bound to take it when it is given: For it is plain the Text ſaid, <hi>Obey them that watch for your ſouls, (Heb.</hi> 13. 17.) before the civil Magiſtrate was yet Chriſtian, to force men to that obedience: Nay indeed, while he was yet Heathen, to deterre them from it, and to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them for it; So that the fifth Commandment obligeth me to obey thoſe whom God hath ſet over me in ſpirituals, no leſs then thoſe whom he hath ſet over me in temporals: And I may no more forſake the Church to ſet up a new Religion, then I may forſake the State to ſet up a new Government: For my obedience is due to both as a moral debt by the neceſſity of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:114933:237"/>
ſince I am as much obliged to my ſpiritual Father for the care of my ſoul, as I am to my civil Father for the care of my body; and therefore I can no more withdraw my duty from the Church, then I can from the Common-wealth: Nor may I go out of my Nation to look for a Head of the Church, any more then to look for a Head of the State, ſince the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment obligeth me equally to the Church and to the State; And I ought to be as much afraid of Schiſm, which is a ſedition againſt the Church; as of Sedition, which is a ſchiſm againſt the State: Sure I am, if I will be a true Goſpeller, I muſt ſee that my converſation be ſuch as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt, and that's a converſation which requires Unity no leſs then Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; Unity of Spirit, no leſs then Verity of Faith: So the Apoſtle adviſing the <hi>Philippians</hi> that their converſation ſhould be as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt, ſheweth them in the next words wherein conſiſteth that converſation, ſaying, <hi>That ye ſtand faſt in one Spirit, with one mind,</hi> there's the Vnity; <hi>ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving together for the faith of the Goſpel;</hi> there's the Verity, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. He permitteth not the pretence of Verity to break the bonds of Unity; for he ſaith <hi>ſtriving together,</hi> (not ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one with, or againſt another,) <hi>for the faith of the Goſpel:</hi> Their concord and communion was to be the credit of their Religion, not the pretence of Religion to be the bane of their communion: He accounts it as neceſſary to their ſalvation that they ſhould ſtand faſt in the ſame Unity, as that they ſhould ſtrive for the ſame Verity: that they ſhould ſtand faſt in one ſpirit, with one mind, as that they ſhould ſtrive for the faith of the Goſpel: This is the true way to ſet up <hi>Chriſts Diſcipline;</hi> for himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another, John</hi> 13. 35. As we are made Chriſts Diſciples by the Verity of our Faith, ſo we are known to be his Diſciples by the Unity of our Love: and if we deſire to ſet up his Diſcipline, we muſt take a courſe that men may know we are his Diſciples: which they cannot do unleſs we have love one to another; and ſurely factions, diviſions, ſtrifes, contentions, are very ill arguments, and worſe evidences of love: So that I cannot be a Schiſmatick in with-drawing my love from Chriſts Church, but I muſt be a piece of an Atheiſt in
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:114933:238"/>
withdrawing my love from Chriſt himſelf, as refuſing to be accounted his Diſciple: This makes Saint <hi>Paul</hi> come like <hi>clypei Dominus ſeptemplicis Ajax,</hi> holding out a Buckler with no leſs then ſeven folds in it to keep off all the aſſaults of ſchiſm; ſaying, 1. There is <hi>one Body,</hi> that is, one Catholick Church of Chriſt, whereof we are all members that profeſs our ſelves to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. 2. <hi>One Spirit,</hi> to quicken and enliven that body. 3. <hi>One hope</hi> of immortality to comfort and confirm it. 4. <hi>One Lord,</hi> (to wit our Saviour Chriſt) that hath purchaſed, and doth claim it. 5. <hi>One faith,</hi> to feed and nouriſh it. 6. <hi>One Baptiſm,</hi> to waſh and cleanſe it. 7. <hi>One God and Father of all,</hi> to rule and govern it, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6.) So that I dare no more be a Schiſmatick, then I dare think to divide this one body, to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply this one Spirit, to falſifie this one hope, to renounce this one Lord, to forſake this one faith, to deſpiſe this one Baptiſm, to deny this one God; for I muſt be zealous to maintain this Chriſtian Communion in its authority, that I may be ſo happy as to enjoy it in its excellency.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Chriſtian Church is truly Catholick, in that it comprizeth all true Believers, of what nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſex, age, or condition ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for God acknowledgeth them all for his children, by faith in Chriſt Jeſus; So ſaith Saint <hi>Paul. Gal. 3. 26, 27. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus; for as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt:</hi> So that whoſoever believeth in Chriſt, and is baptized in his name, muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a member of the Chriſtian Church; whether he be Jew or Greek, bond or free; which was not ſo before Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the fleſh; for then it was ſaid only of the Jews, <hi>ye ſhall be my people, and I will be your God, Jer.</hi> 30. 22. But ſince our bleſſed Saviour hath broken down the partition wall, God hath called to himſelf a people, not of the Jews only, but alſo of the Gentiles; and <hi>it hath come to paſs, that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, ye are not my people, there they are now called the children of the living God, Rom.</hi> 9. 24, 26. Thoſe whom God calls his ſons, how ſhall we not call our brethren, unleſs we will deny him to be our Father? Whence it muſt follow, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian communion is of as great a latitude or extent, as is the Chriſtian Church, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, Gal.</hi> 3. 28. Having ſaid before, <hi>ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> to ſhew they were of the ſame Chriſtian Church; he now ſaith, <hi>ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to ſhew they were alſo of the ſame Chriſtian communion. And this principle we
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:114933:239"/>
may not gain-ſay, if we will acknowledge the excellency of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> true Chriſtian communion: for it cannot be ſo excellent if it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> depend on man, as if it depend on God; if it depend on Chriſts. Vicar, as if it depend on Chriſt himſelf; if it be confined to one party of Chriſtians, as if it be extended to all; for undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is that rule in reaſon, <hi>Bonum quo communius, eo melius, Every good the more common it is, the better it is;</hi> and much more undenyable is it in charity, when it is applyed to our Chriſtian Communion: For it is againſt the nature of God to be under a reſtraint or a Monoply. God the fountain of goodneſs is an univerſal good; He is good unto all; and every other good, the more it partakes of his goodneſs, the more it partakes of his univerſality, and is the more diffuſive of it ſelf, being good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to it ſelf whiles it is not diffuſed, and therefore diffuſing it ſelf, that it may alſo be good to others. Much more is this to be ſeen and confeſſed in the good of Chriſtian Communion, which is therefore good becauſe it is a common good, and may not be abridged of its Community, without being alſo abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of its goodneſs. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> will have us if it be poſſible, to live peaceably with all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 18. therefore much more with the beſt of men, with Chriſtians, who have the name, the word, the image, the Spirit of Chriſt; with all men we muſt keep an <hi>external</hi> and <hi>civil,</hi> but with Chriſtians we muſt more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over maintain an <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> peace. Our <hi>hand</hi> is bound to the good behaviour in regard of Chriſts enemies, but our <hi>heart</hi> is ſo bound in regard of his ſervants. We may not break the <hi>outward peace</hi> with thoſe that <hi>perſecute</hi> him; much leſs may we break the <hi>inward peace</hi> with thoſe that <hi>love</hi> him: There is a great difference betwixt our <hi>Civil</hi> and our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> converſation or communion: The <hi>Civil</hi> depends upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and is accordingly confined to time and place; but the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> depends chiefly upon the ſoul, and therefore may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as far as the ſouls apprehenſion and affection, to know and to love the Truth; Whence Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith to that elect Lady, <hi>Whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but alſo all they that have known the truth</hi> (though they had not known her) <hi>for the truths ſake which dwelleth in us, and ſhall be with us for ever, 2 John</hi> 1. 2. As far as truth and love do extend, ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends our Chriſtian Communion, the <hi>foundation</hi> whereof is
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:114933:239"/>
                              <hi>truth,</hi> the <hi>building</hi> whereof is <hi>love. Communio ſpiritualis, eſt in conſenſu vero vel interpretativo;</hi> Spiritual communion conſiſts either in an explicit or an implicit conſent with other Chriſtians, (<hi>Alenſis par. 2. qu. 161. m.</hi> 10.) which as I may not afford to any Chriſtians as they abide in errour, ſo I may not deny to any Chriſtians as they embrace the Truth: For wherever the Truth is, it calls for my interpretative or virtual conſent, not to deny or gain-ſay it; and where I know it to be, there it calls for my actual and explicit conſent to love and follow it; I may not turn <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> to confine the ſpirit of truth; nor may I turn <hi>Familiſt</hi> to confine the ſpirit of love; For as it cannot be denyed but that the <hi>ſpirit breatheth where it liſteth;</hi> ſo it may not be diſputed, but I muſt love whereſoever the ſpirit is pleaſed to breath; Either I muſt deny the ſpirit of Truth to breath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all thoſe Chriſtians that are not of my profeſſion; or the ſpirit of love to breath upon me, if I will not allow them to be of my Chriſtian Communion; So that I muſt firſt limit and confine the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> before I can limit and confine the <hi>Communion of Saints;</hi> for as is the Church, ſo is the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if the one be Catholick, the other is ſo too: If I will make a particular Chriſtian communion, I muſt make a particular Chriſtian Church, and conſequently make that two Articles of my Faith, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have made but one, even, <hi>The holy Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints;</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple loved for the Truths ſake, and ſo muſt I; where God hath not denyed his truth, there may not I deny my love: If there be ſuch a Chriſtian Church in the world which I cannot well love for its own ſake, yet even that Church muſt I love for the truth ſake; as far as it hath my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Truth, ſo far it muſt have my ſouls love; And though that Church may moſt juſtly claim my love, which hath moſt entirely Chriſts truth; yet no Chriſtian Church, but may in ſome ſort claim it, ſince no Chriſtian Church but hath Chriſts Truth, by which it is made Chriſtian.</p>
                           <p>Some have this truth mingled with many and groſs errours: but God forbid that the tares which the enemy hath ſowed, ſhould make me out of love with that good ſeed, which I know came from Chriſt himſelf: For why ſhould I be alwaies look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the mote in my brothers eye, and not rather ſee the beam
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:114933:240"/>
in mine own? To his own maſter he ſtandeth or falleth, and God is willing to make him <hi>ſtand;</hi> why ſhould I be willing to make him <hi>fall,</hi> or to <hi>keep him down?</hi> If I would look on the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> not on the <hi>man,</hi> I ſhould account him a brother, whom now I think an enemy; for what he is <hi>in Chriſt</hi> is moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though not what is he in himſelf: God looks on me in Chriſt to love me, and why ſhould not I ſo look on my Brother to love him? Gods love in Chriſt towards me covers a <hi>multitude of my ſins,</hi> and why ſhould not my love in the ſame Chriſt towards my Brother <hi>cover a few of his miſtakes?</hi> Sure I am my Saviour hath made Charity a neceſſary condition to the forgiveneſs of my ſins, and therefore I muſt willingly cover my brothers faults, or I cannot hope that God will cover mine. If I will needs lay open his miſcarriages to my ſight, I ſhall but lay open mine own miſcarriages to the ſight of God; for he that curſed <hi>Cham</hi> meerly for not covering, will certainly never bleſs me only for <hi>diſcovering,</hi> either my fathers or my brothers nakedneſs; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge him, but I ſhall bring my ſelf into Judgement; and therefore I muſt paſs by his faults, as I would have God to paſs by mine; This is ſuch a truth as no Chriſtian can deny, and therefore none ſhould contemn; yet is this truth moſt of all contemned by Chriſtians, whiles each particular Church more ſtomachs at a man for not being <hi>one of her members,</hi> then ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces for his being <hi>a member of Chriſt;</hi> Hence thoſe outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous invectives and impious calumnies of one Chriſtian Church againſt another, whiles they all had rather contribute to their own unneceſſary differences <hi>as men,</hi> then to their neceſſary concord and agreement <hi>as Chriſtians;</hi> Each particular Church ſo labouring to advance and enlarge her own Communion, as in effect neglecting and confining the communion of Chriſts Catholick Church. Whereas it is moſt evident by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumciſion nor uncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free; but Chriſt is all and all, Col.</hi> 3. 11. That is, All true Believers promiſcuouſly without any diſtinction or exception of place or perſon, do belong to the communion of Chriſts Catholick Church; And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame Apoſtle ſets all Chriſtians a rule, how infallibly to compaſs, and inviolably to hold this communion, ſaying, <hi>Put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved, bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:114933:240"/>
kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, forbearing one another and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any, even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye, ver.</hi> 12, 13. How many vertues are here joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the leaſt whereof, if put on in bowels, (that is ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without hypocriſie,) will not let us break communion with any Chriſtian? For here is <hi>mercy</hi> to pitty him, <hi>kindneſs</hi> to recall him, <hi>humbleneſs</hi> to yeild to him, <hi>meekneſs</hi> not to provoke him, <hi>long ſuffering</hi> to forbear and to forgive him, when we have a juſt quarrel, and therefore much more not to make a quarrel againſt him, when we have none: And all this is enjoined, as we would be the <hi>Elect and beloved of God,</hi> or thought zealous to follow the example of Chriſt, who hath forborn and forgiven us much more, then we can (for his ſake) forbear or forgive our brethren: Theſe virtues will make us zealous in compaſſing our Chriſtian communion, and one more follows theſe which will make us as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in keeping it; And that is charity, of which it is ſaid, <hi>And above all theſe things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs, ver.</hi> 14. Charity is the <hi>bond of perfection</hi> in regard of our <hi>ſouls,</hi> in regard of our operations, and in regard of our <hi>communion; making our ſouls perfect,</hi> by uniting and binding them together <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> that every one may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the perfections of all; making <hi>our operations perfect,</hi> by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; binding them together <hi>for Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>all</hi> may tend to his glory as if they were but <hi>one;</hi> and making our <hi>communion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> by uniting and binding both our operations and our ſouls, together <hi>with Christ;</hi> for our communion in neither is perfect, till both be joyned with him who is the author of all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For as in the natural body of man, the perfection thereof conſiſteth very much in the communion which the ſeveral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have with themſelves, but much more in the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they all have with the ſoul; ſo in the myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, the perfection thereof conſiſteth very much in the communion which good Chriſtians have with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but much more in the communion which they all have with Chriſt: It is their great glory and bliſs that they all have <hi>in effect one common ſoul,</hi> but their far greater glory and bliſs that they all have <hi>in truth one common Saviour:</hi>
                              <pb n="440" facs="tcp:114933:241"/>
And indeed they firſt meet in him before they meet in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Quae in aliquo tertio conveniunt, ea inter ſe conveniunt,</hi> is not only <hi>conſequently</hi> but alſo <hi>cauſally</hi> true; not only if two or more agree in a third, they agree in themſelves; but alſo, becauſe they agree in a third, therefore they agree in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Thus the two extreams in a ſyllogiſm are joyned both together in the concluſion, becauſe they were both joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before with the ſame <hi>middle term</hi> in the premiſes; ſo is it with men of different and diſagreeing perſwaſions, becauſe they rightly agree <hi>in medio termino,</hi> in one and the ſame <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> they cannot but agree among themſelves: And as it is a rule in Logick or in reaſon, <hi>Si medium in premiſſis rite collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur, duo alii termini non poſſunt aliter quàm recte diſponi;</hi> If the <hi>medium</hi> be rightly placed, the two extreams cannot be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced amiſs; ſo is it in religion, if our <hi>Mediator</hi> may but have his due place and order amongſt us, there will be no fear of our own being out of order amongſt our ſelves: Hence that Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of the firſt Chriſtians, <hi>And all that believed were together and had all things common, Act.</hi> 2. 44. They were not ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in their perſons, as to be aſunder in their affections; and therefore we muſt interpret this verſe from the firſt, and ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>They were all with one accord in one place, or with one mind and ſoul;</hi> They were <hi>unanimouſly</hi> met together as well as <hi>perſonally,</hi> they were in one <hi>mind</hi> as well as in one <hi>place;</hi> And ſo will all true believers to the worlds end; Nay, they will meet in one mind, when they cannot meet in one place; for they are all joyned together as it were in <hi>one common ſoul,</hi> though not <hi>as men,</hi> according to <hi>Averrois</hi> his phanſie, who ſaid there was but one numerical intelligent ſoul which aſſiſted all mankind; Yet <hi>as Chriſtians,</hi> according to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Divinity, <hi>with one mind and one mouth glorifie God,</hi> Rom. 15 6. or <hi>perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind and the ſame judgement,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 10. or, <hi>being of one accord, of one mind, Phil.</hi> 2. 2. And in this reſpect they have alſo all things common; for though we may not allow an external community of goods and bodies to the confuſion of humane property and ſociety, yet we muſt allow an internal community of affections and ſouls to the exerciſe of Chriſtian love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: For if that rule be true of the outward or carnal man,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:114933:241"/>
                              <hi>Homo ſum, humani à me nihil alienum puto;</hi> I am a man, and think nothing belongs to a man but belongs to me; then much more is it true of the inward and ſpiritual man, I am a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and think no proſperity or adverſity can happen to any Chriſtian, but the ſame happens to my ſelf: For this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of Chriſt, who ſaid unto <hi>Saul, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecutest, Act.</hi> 9. 5. Thinking the injuries done unto his members as done unto himſelf; Nay, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the precept of Chriſt commanding us to think ſo to; wherefore he ſaith, <hi>Rejoyce with them that do rejoyce, and weep with them that weep; Be of the ſame mind one towards another, Rom.</hi> 12. 15, 16. Bidding us be of the ſame mind, that we might be of the ſame affections, and have the ſame joyes and the ſame ſorrows: This contemplation ſhould indear it ſelf withall Chriſtians to <hi>remember,</hi> and much more to <hi>practice</hi> it; for then all outrages in words and deeds, which are now ſo ſcandalouſly heightned, would be peaceably compoſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every one would look upon <hi>anothers injury as his own,</hi> and conſequently would be afraid of wronging <hi>his brother,</hi> that he might not wrong <hi>himſelf:</hi> Thus would the peace of God rule in all our hands and tongues, if it did firſt rule in all our hearts, which is alſo required as the cheifeſt means whereby to preſerve Chriſtian communion, <hi>and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which alſo ye are called in one body, and be ye thankful, ver.</hi> 15. Where the Apoſtle exhorteth us to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian unity and concord for three reaſons: Firſt, becauſe <hi>God is the author,</hi> and <hi>lover of it,</hi> whence it is called <hi>the peace of God;</hi> and we may be amazed to ſee that men ſhould ſay in their dayly prayers, <hi>Deus author pacis &amp; amator, O God which art the author of peace, and lover of concord,</hi> and yet not love it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Secondly, becauſe it is a badge, or rather an <hi>ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> and <hi>part</hi> of our Chriſtian calling, whence it is ſaid, <hi>To the which alſo ye are called in one body;</hi> that as there is <hi>no ſchiſm in the body, but the members have the ſame care one for another; and whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it, or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it;</hi> ſo it might alſo be with us now we are <hi>the body of Chriſt, and members in particular, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 27. For Chriſt hath called us to be of one <hi>body;</hi> and how then ſhall we not be of one <hi>mind?</hi>
                              <pb n="442" facs="tcp:114933:242"/>
Thirdly, becauſe it is an expreſſion of that thankfulneſs which we owe to God, for giving us that peace, which this world, were it never ſo quiet, could not give, and be it never ſo quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome, cannot take away; whence it is ſaid, <hi>and be ye thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> to wit for that peace of a good conſcience here, and a bleſſed eternity hereafter, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for you, of which the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified by faith we have peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> We can never be truly thankful for that peace of God which our bleſſed Saviour hath purchaſed for us, unleſs we labour earneſtly to have peace one with another: Nor may we pretend that the love of <hi>truth</hi> makes us to have but little regard of <hi>peace;</hi> for the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth that peace and truth may very well be joyned together in our converſation, in that after the command for peace, he giveth the command for truth; and firſt ſaith, <hi>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts,</hi> and after that, <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all wiſdom;</hi> He firſt requireth the <hi>peace,</hi> and then the <hi>truth,</hi> inverting the order by confirming the authority of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zachariah,</hi> who firſt requireth the <hi>truth,</hi> and then the <hi>peace;</hi> therefore <hi>love the truth and peace, Zach.</hi> 8. 19. For as it is an undeniable argument, that the tenth Commandment of the decalogue cannot fitly be divided into two ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, becauſe the order of the words being changed in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> and in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> it could not be known which of the two precepts were to be ſet down firſt; for <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 17. firſt is forbidden the deſire of our neighbours houſe; but <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 21. Firſt is forbidden the deſire of our neighbours wife; ſo that in both places is forbidden but one inordinate deſire in regard of the act, though two in regard of the object; and conſequently both inordinate deſires come under one and the ſame precept, or we muſt be poſed to ſhew which of the two prohibitions makes the ninth, which makes the tenth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; So is it in this command of loving peace and truth, the Prophet firſt names the Truth, the Apoſtle firſt names the Peace, that we not knowing which of the two we are bound to follow firſt, might be the more induſtrious to follow both, being as much afraid of forſaking the peace to follow the truth, as of forſaking the truth to follow the peace; for that we can
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:114933:242"/>
do neither, but we muſt invert the order, and pervert the intent of Gods command; which yet more plainly appears from the words of the ſame Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul, <gap reason="foreign">

                                 </gap>, Eph.</hi> 4. 15. Speaking the truth in love, or doing the truth in love, for ſo the Vulgar Latine <hi>veritatem facientes in charitate;</hi> we may render the words, Be ye true in love, ſhew your ſelves <hi>true men,</hi> in that you are <hi>charitable men;</hi> for here is plainly but one precept for the exerciſe of both virtues, to ſhew we cannot be defective in the love, but we muſt alſo be defective in the truth; I will then be as zealous for Chriſtian love, as for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian truth, and not think I can do my Saviour good ſervice, whilſt I am ſo intent upon the <hi>truth of his Religion,</hi> as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>peace of his communion; Communicant</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> muſt be to me terms convertible; as far as reacheth the Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſo far alſo reacheth the communion; For he that is a good Chriſtian doth communicate with Chriſt; and how can I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the one without excluding the other out of my communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? What is truly Chriſtian in the worſt of Chriſtians is love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Chriſts ſake; and though I exceedingly rejoyce in old <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meons</hi> happineſs to take my Saviour from the arms of a pure Virgin Church, as he did from the arms of his pure Virgin Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. yet I will not run from him, if I find him talking with a woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> revealing himſelf to her that liveth in the ſtate of incontinency, <hi>John</hi> 4. It ſhall be my deſire to meet with him dayly in mine own Church that is not defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led either with ſuperſtition or with faction; but it ſhall be my joy to meet with him in any other Church, though ſhe be actually defiled with both, and run a whoring after her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions: For I may not refuſe to communicate with any Church in that wherein ſhe is truely Chriſtian, unleſs I will venter to divide and ſeparate from Chriſt himſelf: Wherefore I will communicate with all Chriſtian Churches, as far as they are <hi>ſo,</hi> in the <hi>diſpoſition of my ſoul,</hi> though I cannot in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of my body;</hi> ſo ſhall I be ſure neither to be a <hi>ſchiſmatick</hi> in a Church that is truly <hi>Catholick,</hi> and moreover I ſhall be a <hi>Catholick</hi> in a Church that may be guilty of <hi>ſchiſm; Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Catholicus in Eccleſia Schiſmatica,</hi> is in my account a better temper then <hi>Animus ſchiſmaticus in Eccleſia Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi>
                              <pb n="444" facs="tcp:114933:243"/>
I had rather have a Catholick ſpirit in a ſchiſmatical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church, then a ſchiſmatical ſpirit in a Catholick Church; for the one is an antidote to allay the poyſon I meet withall, the other is able to turn an antidote into poyſon. To have a Catholick Spirit in an Anticatholick Church may keep me a true Catholick in the communion of Schiſmaticks; but to have an Anticatholick Spirit in a Catholick Church, will make me a Schiſmatick even in the communion of Saints.</p>
                           <p>Therefore <hi>Chriſtianus Catholicus,</hi> Chriſtian Catholick is the Title I deſire to aſſume, and will labour to juſtifie; the one may be as my <hi>proper,</hi> the other as my <hi>common</hi> name; the one ſhewing what I am in my <hi>perſon,</hi> the other ſhewing what I am in my <hi>communion.</hi> For I cannot but think <hi>Lactanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his pen borrowed inke from heaven, when it dropped down this admirable obſervation, <hi>Chriſtiani eſſe deſierunt, qui Chriſti nomine amiſſo, humana &amp; externa vocabula in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duerunt; Lact. de vera ſap. cap. 30. They have left off to be Chriſtians, who have left off the name of Chriſt, that they may call themſelves by other mens external names:</hi> For indeed all other names are Notes and cauſes of <hi>diviſion,</hi> tis only the name of Chriſt is the note and cauſe of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> amongſt Chriſtians: This is truely the voice of a dove that hath no gall, and me thinks I ſee the Holy Ghoſt ſtill appearing in this Dove: Sure I am there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but only the name of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. and why ſhould I then either deſire a name that cannot ſhew my Religion, or deſire a Religion that cannot bring me ſalvation?</p>

The firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion we have with our Saviour as he is the beginning; the ſecond as he is the firſt born from the dead; Hence it is that the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſo exceedingly labours in all his Epiſtles, firſt to make us <hi>ſenſible of,</hi> then to make us <hi>thankfull for</hi> this great mercy.

Were it poſſible for any man to paſs from death to life who loveth not his brother, yet it were not poſsible for him to know ſo much; <hi>We know that we have paſſed, becauſe we love;</hi> therefore they who will not have this love, cannot have this knowledge, and indeed they cannot have this <hi>paſſage:</hi> for he that abideth in death, hath not yet paſſed from death unto life;

                           <p>1.

                           <p>2. <hi>The company,</hi> and that is ſo good, that we cannot hope for better in heaven: for it conſiſts of Angels, and of the firſt-born in Chriſt, whoſe names are written in heaven, and of God the Maker, Preſerver and Rewarder of theſe, and the Judge of all

that hate and oppoſe them; with all theſe do we actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in Chriſts Church whiles we are here on earth, with Angels as the aſſiſtants, with good men as the members; and with God as the preſident of this communion; nay indeed, we actually communicate with more then theſe, for alſo <hi>with the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect;</hi> ſo that if any juſt man go from hence out of our company, yet he goes not out of our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: for we follow after him to heaven in our affections, though we ſtill continue and remain here on earth, in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

They look upon this feſtival as inſtituted for Gods glory, and think it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſafe nor fit for Chriſtians to glorifie God through <hi>Moſes,</hi> but through Chriſt. And therefore deſire to honour him not by a Sabbath, but by a Lords day; for that the Sabbath was a
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:114933:248"/>
type of Chriſts reſt in the grave, (who reſted there only that whole day, as it were to bury it with himſelf) but the Lords day is an undoubted memorial of his reſurrection; So that the one carries in its name, if not in its nature a falſe proteſtation concerning the Chriſtian faith, and may poſſibly in time make us turn Jews: The other carries in its name and nature a true profeſſion of our faith, and can only help to <hi>make</hi> and to <hi>keep</hi> us good Chriſtians, as immediately directing our thoughts and our thankfulneſs to our Saviour Chriſt, which alone is the way to make us true Evangelical profeſſors; this being the ſumme of the whole Goſpel, <hi>That he was delivered for our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and roſe again for our Iuſtification, Rom.</hi> 4 26. And it is plain that the whole Goſpel doth ſo directly tend to the Article of Chriſts reſurrection, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith expreſly, it can neither be rightly preached nor profeſſed without it: <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith alſo is vain, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 14. It nearly concerns all Chriſtian Miniſters to abandon thoſe tenents which may either directly or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make vain their own preaching, or the peoples faith: And it is to be feared the Sabbatarian Doctrine may tend to this; for it is to be avowed that the turning thoſe ſolemn feſtivals out of the Church, which peculiarly commemorate the Incarnation, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and teach us to bleſs God for the ſame, that the Sabbath may be ſet up as Lady paramount and Queen Regent to controule and confine all our publick worſhip, can in no caſe make for the <hi>honour of Chriſt,</hi> and therefore not for the <hi>truth of Chriſtianity:</hi> For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>that in all things he muſt have the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,</hi> and if in all things, then ſurely both in duties and in daies; and if in <hi>duties,</hi> then much more in <hi>daies;</hi> for if the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be not acceptable to God but <hi>in him,</hi> then ſure the day cannot be acceptable but <hi>for him;</hi> Tis proper for the Jew to keep a Sabbath, who thinks himſelf ſtill bound to worſhip God through <hi>Moſes;</hi> but tis proper for the Chriſtian to keep a Lords day, who knows himſelf bound to worſhip and glorifie God only through Chriſt Jeſus the Lord of glory: And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> readeth this Lecture to the Jews themſelves, (and much more to us Chriſtians,) in thoſe words to the Hebrews, <hi>Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:114933:248"/>
that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be glory for ever and ever, Amen, Heb.</hi> 13. 20, 21. Where he briefly declares the ſumme not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that whole Epiſtle, but alſo of the whole Chriſtian Faith, and that by way of benediction, to ſhew we cannot have the bleſſing of Chriſtians, unleſs we have the faith of Chriſtians; And that faith teacheth us to believe and confeſs, 1. That God is reconciled to us, <hi>Now the God of peace.</hi> 2. That our Saviour Chriſt alone hath wrought <hi>for us,</hi> and offereth <hi>to us</hi> this recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, as our King, <hi>our Lord Jeſus,</hi> as our Prophet, <hi>the great Shepherd,</hi> and as our Prieſt, <hi>through the blood of the everlaſting Covenant.</hi> 3.

That he is ready to give us the ſuperabundant fruits of all, by making us <hi>perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> In all theſe ineſtimable and undeſerved mercies, it is Chriſt alone that is all in all; wherefore it follows in the next words, <hi>through Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he in himſelf, and the Father in him is to be glorified for all, as it is ſaid, <hi>To whom be glory for ever and ever, Amen.</hi> God is the God of peace to us men, in that he brought again from the dead the Lord Jeſus; ſo that we cannot rightly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him for the reconciliation, unleſs we glorifie him for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. And for this cauſe happily it was that the Church did antiently interpoſe <hi>Halleluiah</hi> in the midſt of thoſe ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Text, which ſhe choſe for her publick ſervice in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the memory of Chriſts reſurrection, not to <hi>interrupt</hi> the words or ſenſe of the Scriptures, but rather to <hi>explain</hi> them; teaching us that good Chriſtians ſhould not read or hear any part of the Text without thinking of Chriſt, and that they ſhould not think of Chriſt, without praiſing God in him and for him, and that praiſing God in and for their Saviour Chriſt, they can never be zealous enough in their praiſes, nor rejoyce too much in his ſalvation. Therefore they intermingled Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah not only in the Hymns of the Text, where it might be thought a natural appendix, but alſo in the Doctrines of it, where (at firſt ſight) it might ſeem altogether an unneceſſary
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:114933:249"/>
addition; As for example, thus they recite that Hymn of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>He brought forth his people with joy, Halleluiah, and his choſen with gladneſs, Pſalm 105. ver.</hi> 42. And thus alſo that doctrine of Saint <hi>Peter, As new born babes, Halleluiah, deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 2. Where Halleluiah doth not cloſe a part of a Hymn, but breaks off a doctrinal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, ſurely not to diſtract our attentions, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our affections; and to poſſeſs our ſouls wholly with the joy and love of Chriſt, without which neither our praying nor our preaching is acceptable unto God, or available unto us. And the Church ſeemeth to have borrowed this practice from the Apoſtles; for it is much to be obſerved that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers not any one Doctrine of the Chriſtian verity without his <hi>Halleluiah,</hi> that is, without a peculiar doxology to God in Chriſt: So in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, (1. 8.) Firſt I thank my God through Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> So to the <hi>Corinthians (1. 1. 4.) I thank my God alwayes on your behalf;</hi> So to the <hi>Galatians, (1. 5.) To God and our Father be glory for ever and ever,</hi> Amen: So to the <hi>Epheſians (1. 3.) Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And ſo in the reſt of his Epiſtles: Nay he doth not only prefix his Halleluiah and lay it as the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and bottom of his work, but he doth alſo familiarly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weave it whilſt he is working, as it were ſome choice and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent thred to checquer and adorn the whole piece: Thus in the Doctrine of Chriſtian regeneration, <hi>Rom. 7. 25.

Thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are ſuch words as do more then perſwade the belief, they do alſo enforce the love of that Chriſtian truth, which of it ſelf is able to make not only one <hi>Foelix,</hi> but alſo all mankinde to quake and tremble: For Chriſt raiſing us from the death, by vertue of his reſurrection; will alſo uphold us in the judgement, by vertue of his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Laſtly, thus alſo in the Doctrine of Chriſtian patience and preſeverance, concerning our being ſtrengthned with might by the Spirit of God in the inward man, and Chriſts dwelling in

For this cauſe I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and he ends with praiſes after it, <hi>ver. 21. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him be glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus throughout all ages world without end:</hi> Which manner of teaching by prayer and praiſe, muſt needs make a deeper impreſſion upon the ſoul then all the arguments of Logick, or perſwaſions of Rhetorick, that have been or can be invented by the art of man.</p>
                           <p>And indeed the ſame is alſo the Method of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and of the reſt of the Apoſtles, to intermingle prayers and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to God in all their writings, and may not unfitly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Method of grace:</hi> And <hi>Alenſis</hi> gives this reaſon for it, <hi>Alius eſt modus ſcientiae ad informationem affectus ſecundum pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem; Alius ad informationem intellectus ſecundum veritatem; (Alex. Ale. qu. 1. mem.</hi> 4.) There is one method of teaching the will how to embrace piety, another method of teaching the underſtanding how to embrace truth: For the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is beſt informed by the evidence of demonſtration, but the will is beſt enflamed by the power of devotion: And again, <hi>ſunt principia veritatis ut veritatis, &amp; ſunt principia veritatis ut bonitatis.</hi> There are principles of truth which are to be learned as they are true; and there are principles of truth which are to be learned as they are good; other ſciences pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from principles of truth which are to be learned as they are true, becauſe their truth is moſt notoriouſly evident; But Divinity proceeds from principles of truth which are to be learned as they are good, becauſe their goodneſs is more notoriouſly evident then their truth; <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de hec ſcientia magis eſt virtutis quam Artis, &amp; ſapientia magis quam ſcientia: magis enim conſiſtit virtute &amp; efficacia quam in contemplatione &amp; notitia; (Alen. ibid. in reſpon.</hi> 2.) Therefore is Divinity rather a ſcience of power then of Art, and conſequently rather a Sapience then a Science; for both in its being, and in its knowing it conſiſts more of virtue and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then of contemplation or knowledge: Accordingly the Apoſtle himſelf, (ſaith <hi>Alenſis</hi>) profeſſeth that his preaching was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:114933:250"/>
of the Spirit and of power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. which is ſuch a demonſtration as is more fitted to the will then to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, becauſe it hath more of piety then of evidence; mans wiſdom teaching the underſtanding, but Gods wiſdom rather teaching the will and affections; The one working more upon the head, but the other working more upon the heart; And therefore the Method which Gods wiſdom uſeth in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, is not unfitly called the Method of grace. For it is a Method that neither nature nor Art can teach us, but only the Spirit of Grace, and is accordingly uſed in no other ſcience but only in Divinity: In teaching other ſciences he that ſhould break out into a prayer or ejulation, would either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his principle, or miſtake his concluſion; But in teaching Divinity, this is the only way to ſtrengthen both our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries againſt forgetfulneſs, and our judgements againſt miſtakes; Here it is not <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>For doubtleſs we may beſt learn ſoul-ſaving Divinity in the way the Apoſtles taught it, that is, by intermingling prayers and praiſes with our endeavours, ſince this is the only way to learn Chriſt; for Chriſt cannot be learned till he be received, and cannot be received in a ſoul not prepared by pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and devotion to entertain him: This occaſioned that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Saint <hi>Paul, As ye have therefore received Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him, Col.</hi> 2. 6. In other ſciences we need learn but the Doctrine that is taught, no matter for the author that teacheth it; But in Chriſtian Divinity we muſt learn and receive Chriſt the author, or we cannot rightly learn and receive the Doctrine: <hi>Haec cloquentia quaedam eſt Doctrinae ſalutaris, movendo affectus diſcentium accommodata,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Epiſt. 119. ad Januarium;</hi> Whence we may gather the true definition of Chriſtian eloquence, <hi>It is that which moſt moveth our affections, and raiſeth them up to Chriſt;</hi> this is the reaſon why the Apoſtles uſed this new kind of method in their writings, not for the want of knowledge, but for the abundance of love and charity, which was wholly enamored
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:114933:250"/>
on Chriſt, and the beauties and excellencies of the Chriſtian Religion, making them to proclaim to all the world theſe three things concerning that Religion which they taught after this new manner.</p>
                           <p>1. That Chriſtian Religion is not <hi>opus naturae,</hi> proceeding from the principles of nature; for then they would have uſed the Method of nature, who firſt planted it; but <hi>opus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> The work of Grace, and therefore they uſed the Method of grace.</p>
                           <p>2. That Chriſtian Religion muſt not be made <hi>opus artis,</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mans invention or inſtitution; for if it would not borrow ſo much as outward form or Method from the art of man, (there being no ſcience in the world taught by ſuch a Method as Divinity is, in the Scriptures) much leſs any inward matter or ſubſtance from it.</p>
                           <p>3. That Chriſtian Religion muſt be taken in the whole, in <hi>credendis &amp; agendis,</hi> in belief and practice both together: for therefore did the Apoſtles teach it by praying, to ſhew that we muſt learn it by practicing, prayer it ſelf being the beſt practice of Chriſtianity.</p>
                           <p>Thus it is neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould be the Alpha and Ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, the firſt and the laſt in all our thoughts, words and works; for this is the end of all the Scripture, (and they who undervalue the Scripture, ſeem not to know this end, or not to regard it) as ſaith Saint <hi>John, But theſe are written that ye might believe, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name, John</hi> 20. 31. as if he had ſaid, <hi>God gave us the Scriptures,</hi> (eſpecially the New Teſtament,) <hi>for this end, that we might glorifie Chriſt as the eternal Son of God and only Saviour of the world, and that by ſo doing, we might through him come to inherit eternal glory.</hi>

but alſo for the Communion of his Church againſt faction; though it firſt take care for the Religion, and after that for the communion; For Religion knits and unites us immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God; But communion knits and unites us one to the other; Religion is the very knowledge and worſhip of God; communion is only the agreement in that knowledge and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: Religion <hi>makes the Saints,</hi> communion only <hi>ſhews</hi> and <hi>declares</hi> them; Religion makes <hi>true</hi> worſhip, communion makes <hi>publick</hi> worſhip: Accordingly God firſt provided for the duty, then for the ſolemnity; firſt for the Religion, then for the communion: Thus in the three firſt precepts of the decalogue, he requires the true knowledge and worſhip of God, which conſtitute our Religion; and in the fourth, he requires the publick profeſſion of that knowledge, and exerciſe of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which conſtitute our communion: For the firſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requires us to have right apprehenſions and affections concerning God, by the internal acts of our ſouls in truſting, believing, loving him above all things: The ſecond and third require us to teſtifie thoſe our inward apprehenſions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning him, by our outward adoration or reverence, and by our outward confeſſing or glorifying his holy name: Then follows the fourth, requiring us to muſter up our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and affections, adorations and glorifications altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in one publick entire and holy communion: So that the fourth Commandment is little other then a new ratification or eſtabliſhment of the three firſt; all in one to be obſerved or performed ſolemnly and publickly: enjoyning us to do thoſe holy duties on ſome ſet dayes openly and joyntly in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which were before enjoyned every day ſeverally and privately in one Religion: And conſequent the 4th Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in effect an eſtabliſhment of the Church, as the three firſt are an eſtabliſhment of Religion; For the conſecration of times, places, perſons, maintenance and forms of worſhip, is here commanded, though time only be named, and all for this end, that God may be publickly glorified, (and our ſouls edified) in the communion of Saint.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore thoſe that prophane the places, oppoſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, rob the maintenance, and reproach the forms conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the publick worſhip of God, are as great Sabbath-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:114933:256"/>
as thoſe that prophane the time; nor is there in truth a greater enemy to the Sabbath then the Sabbatarian: as not a greater enemy to faith then the Solifidean; the one crying up the Sabbath in the <hi>day,</hi> but beating it down in the <hi>duty;</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the circumſtance of time, but depreſſing and debaſing not only other circumſtances, but alſo the very ſubſtance of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; The other making a noiſe of faith which fils the phanſie with ſtrong perſwaſions, but neglecting the work of faith which fils the ſoul with holy affections: What? do we think our Saviour Chriſt ſaid in vain, <hi>Father, glorifie thy name?</hi> or that God himſelf anſwered in vain by a voyce from heaven, ſaying, <hi>I have both glorified it and will glorifie it again? John</hi> 12. 28. If not, let us acknowledge this to be the main end of our Chriſtian Religion to glorifie the name of God, and then we ſhall be afraid to oppoſe any thing directly conducing to his praiſe and glory: For certainly, thoſe words are never to grow out of date, <hi>This voice came not becauſe of me, but for your ſakes, John</hi> 12. 30. We know it was the whole work of Chriſt to glorifie God, and what elſe can we think is the work of the Chriſtian Religion?</p>
                           <p>Let this then, (I mean the glory of God) be taken for the ballance of the Sanctuary, wherein to weigh all our <hi>Tenents</hi> and all our <hi>practices,</hi> and we ſhall never put a <hi>parſimonious,</hi> much leſs an envious gloſs upon the fourth Commandment, as if it had taken care only for one circumſtance of publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but neglected all the reſt; thats a <hi>parſimonious</hi> gloſs; or as if it had provided for the circumſtances alone, and not much more for the ſubſtance of Gods publick worſhip and ſervice; thats an envious irreligious gloſs; For in truth, as in the Creed every ſubſequent Article of faith preſuppoſeth the belief of all before it, that it ſelf may be rightly believed, the ſame truth being firſt in the order of nature, which is there put firſt in the order of Revelation; So alſo in the decalogue, eſpecially in the firſt table, every ſubſequent commandment preſuppoſeth the obedience of all before it, that it ſelf may be rightly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſame duty being firſt in the order of nature which is there put firſt in the order of injunction: God in his very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of revealing truths and enjoyning duties, ſhewing us that we cannot take any of either, but we muſt take all: And this is

                           <p>And in this reſpect we may eaſily believe, and readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the firſt Sabbath to have been both inſtituted and kept in Paradiſe; for the Church was there founded, and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints there firſt eſtabliſhed: That is, the communion of holy men with the holy Angels and with themſelves, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together to ſing Halleluiahs to God their bleſſed Creator, which was indeed the principal end of their creation: And accordingly men were at firſt enabled to the diſcharge of this great duty, as well as the Angels, having the right and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable forms of praiſing God imprinted in their hearts; and when through tranſgreſſion they had diſabled themſelves, it pleaſed God of his infinite goodneſs to grant them as it were a new impreſſion, and to give them a ſecond edition of thoſe praiſes in his holy Scriptures, which before had been written in their own hearts, but were now very much ſlurred and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, if not quite obliterated and blotted out.

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:114933:257"/>
only fit to buſie and tickle the phanſie.</p>
                           <p>By which ungodly practice, (for ſo it muſt be called, though it pretend to the greateſt meaſure of godlineſs,) they in effect throw the fourth Commandment out of the Church, whilſt they pretend to ſet it up over the Altar, ſince not ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtill or keeping an outward reſt, but comming together that we may all labour inwardly in Hallowing the name of our Father which is in heaven, is the cheif moral duty of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; For as in the promiſe of the fifth, ſo in the precept of the fourth Commandment, the Lawgivers expreſſion contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the leaſt part of his intention, and we may no more confine this precept in the duty, then we may that promiſe in the reward; Therefore as we would be loth to look no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for our inheritance, ſo we ſhould be wary how we aſſert that God looks no farther then the Sabbath day for our obedience: Truth is, it pleaſed God to train up the <hi>Jews</hi> in his fear by types and figures, and as it were to wrap up heaven in earth, ſpirituals in temporals, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals in ceremonials, ſubſtances in circumſtances, to them as well in his precepts as in his promiſes; particularly in that precept which concerned his publick worſhip becauſe that amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> was for the moſt part Ceremonial and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. Wherefore if we deſire rightly and fully to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the fourth Commandment, we muſt conceive it in ſo great a latitude as to comprize all thoſe Commiſſions, injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, invitations, and exhortations which we find in the Old and New Teſtament, given either to Kings, or Miniſters, or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, concerning the ordering, eſtabliſhing, reforming, practicing, profeſſing or promoting the ſolemn publick worſhip of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, which is in truth the principal end thereof, unleſs we will ſay that all thoſe moral duties are reducible to none of the ten commandments in the decalogue, and conſequently that all they were will-worſhippers who either profeſſed, or promoted or practiſed them; For as ſuch duties of Religion are to be done publickly and ſolemnly by many together in one communion, they are not reducible to any of the three firſt commandments which ſpeak to ſingle perſons, but only to the fourth which alone ſpeaketh to whole families, (or to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons joyned together in one community.) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:114933:257"/>
it is not amiſs to ſay that <hi>Hallowed be thy name</hi> is that Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which moſt directly prayes for Grace to perform the duty of the fourth Commandment, ſince all other things are hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for his names ſake; God ſanctifying times, places, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and forms of prayers and praiſe, unto us, that he may ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie us unto himſelf: nor is it amiſs to ſay, that <hi>the holy Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints,</hi> is that Article of faith which moſt directly profeſſeth to believe the truth of the fourth Commandment; for it is only the Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints, which doth rightly hallow and praiſe Gods holy name: The Hallowing of Gods moſt holy name belonging equally to the decalogue, and to the Creed, and to the Lords moſt holy prayer; belonging to the decalogue, as it is a duty to be performed; belonging to the Creed, as it is a truth to be believed; and belonging to the Lords Prayer, as it is a good to be deſired, as we are all bound to pray that we may perform this duty, and believe this truth.</p>
                           <p>For Faith, Hope and Charity are not to be ſeparated from one another; but do alike belong to ſupernatural Truths, and to religious or moral duties, becauſe both truths and duties do equally call for our faith to know and believe them, and for our hope to crave and deſire them, and for our Charity to love and embrace them: But if we take the outward ſanctification of a day for the principal morality of the Sabbath, we ſhall ſcarce find a Petition in the Lords moſt holy and moſt perfect prayer, relating to ſuch a Duty, nor an Article in the Apoſtles Creed, relating to ſuch a Truth: and ſo we ſhall phanſie to our ſelves ſuch a morality as is without a good to be deſired, and without a truth to be believed; for without doubt, The Lords Prayer briefly containeth all the good we are bound to deſire, and the Apoſtles Creed briefly containeth all the Truths we are bound to believe, as well as the Decalogue briefly containeth all the Duties we are bound to practiſe and perform. Whereas on the other ſide, if we look upon hallowing the name of God in our publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as upon the principal moral duty that is enjoyned in the fourth Commandment, we ſhall find the Decalogue, and the Creed, and the Lords prayer, all joyntly agreeing together in this, the one commanding it to be done, the other believing it
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:114933:258"/>
is done perfectly in heaven, the third praying it may be done perfectly on earth.</p>
                           <p>And in this ſenſe it is evident, that keeping of the Sabbath is a moral duty, not to end with time, but to laſt to all eternity, as becometh Righteouſneſs, which is immortal, not temporary; and that ſo intrinſecally and eſſentially, that if it be not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, it cannot be righteouſneſs: Thus did <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> with his righteous poſterity keep the Sabbath (long before the Law was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to appoint the day) as we read <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 26. <hi>Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord;</hi> which words clearly ſet forth the firſt exerciſe of publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the firſt communion of Saints upon the earth; ſo <hi>Junius</hi> upon the place, <hi>Senſus eſt, Adam &amp; Seth in cujus poſteris man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſura erat Eccleſia, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning is, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> in whoſe poſterities the Church was to be continued, obſerving that their families were in danger of being corrupted by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly converſation of the wicked <hi>Cainites,</hi> and conſequently that the worſhip of God, whereof they were the Miniſters (and therefore the Truſtees) was like ſpeedily to decay, did from that time aſſemble their children together into one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or into one body of a Church, and by their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their praying, and their exerciſes of piety and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did labour to convert the wicked, and to confirm the righteous, from which their religious obſervations they did purchaſe to themſelves the title or appellation of the Sons of God; <hi>Nam prius quidem invocavit Adam, ſed in familia; tunc verò invocarunt multi, ſed in eccleſiam, velut in caulam, recepti, à mundi peccantis &amp; ſeducentis conſortio; For</hi> Adam <hi>had indeed before that, called upon the name of the Lord, in his own family; But at that time many families called upon God together, being gathered into the Church as into a fold, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating themſelves from the ſinners and ſeducers of the world;</hi> Thus in effect, ſaith <hi>Junius:</hi> And we cannot but ſay, that this was a moral duty ſuggeſted to them by the Law written in their hearts, which teacheth men to enter into a ſociety or communion to ſerve themſelves, and much more to ſerve their God; <hi>Druſius</hi> goes yet further, ſaying thus, <hi>Eo tempore ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus certos colendi Deum inſtitutos fuiſſe, quos obſervarent filii
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:114933:258"/>
Dei;</hi> At that time were inſtituted ſome certain rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of worſhipping God, which the Sons of God were bound to obſerve. But <hi>Aquinas</hi> had ſaid the ſame long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; for after this objection, <hi>how could Enos firſt begin to call upon the Name of the Lord? for that were to ſay that the Church began not till his time;</hi> he gives this anſwer, <hi>Non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepit divinum cultum, ſed invenit aliquem modum ſingularem colendi velorandi Deum,</hi> He did not firſt begin to worſhip God, but found out a new way of ſolemnly worſhipping him, which new way <hi>Junius</hi> tells us, was of aſſembling many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies together, whereas before, for want of Communicants, <hi>Adam</hi> had ſerved God only in his own family: But now that the Church was further enlarged and ſpread in ſeveral families, it was neceſſary that all thoſe families ſhould aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together to do their homage to their leige Lord and maker.</p>
                           <p>And the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe did before him give the ſame expoſition of that Text; for though the words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe be different in <hi>Buxtorfs</hi> and <hi>Montanus</hi> his Hebrew Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which is very uſual, whilſt the Hebrew Text in both is alwayes the ſame, the Church not thinking her ſelf bound to the ſame care in keeping of Tranſlations as of the Originals; yet the ſenſe is not different, but one and the ſame of either Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe, and that is this, <hi>then began men to pray in the name of the Lord, that is, then they began to pray altogether in one congregation, whereas before they had prayed only in ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>So then, this is the true keeping of the Sabbath, to Hallow Gods moſt holy name for its own ſake, and to hallow the things conducting or belonging thereto, for his names ſake, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that command, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> which though found four ſeveral times in <hi>Leviticus, (Lev.</hi> 11. 44. 11. 45. &amp; <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 2. &amp; <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. 7.) yet is not a precept of the Levitical, but of the Moral Law, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> plainly ſhews us, alledging theſe very words as an invincible demonſtration, that it is our bounden duty to be holy in all manner of converſation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is written, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15, 16. Where this is the force of the argumentation; ſuch as I am, ſuch muſt all they be who will have relation to me, or communion
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:114933:259"/>
with me; but I am holy; therefore muſt they be holy: And this argumentation, though it moſt properly belong to perſons, yet may it not be confined only to them, but is alſo to be extended to <hi>things</hi> and <hi>Actions; Perſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally do look upon the profanation of conſecrated time as the breach of the Sabbath; and we do well, for ſo it is; But we look not far enough; for profanation is of as large an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as conſecration; and we are to know that perſons and Things, and Actions, are all alike conſecrated to Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip, by virtue of the fourth Commandment. Thus ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Give thanks O Iſrael to God the Lord in the congregation, Pſalm</hi> 68. 26. Which are the words, (ſaith <hi>Sol.

writ in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tables; And what can be the ſubſtance of it, but this, that God ought to be publickly worſhipped in the congregations, and therefore all thoſe things are made, and are to be reputed holy, which neceſſarily belong to his publick worſhip: For ſure that was no will-worſhip in the Jews which we find recorded for our example, <hi>Nehem. 8. And all the people gathered themſelves together as one man;</hi> I ask by what Commandment, if not by the fourth? ſo it is apparent that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Gods worſhip is a duty of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> will have this communion, extend it ſelf to the whole body of Chriſtians whereſoever diſperſed, (for he writes to the ſtrangers ſcattered abroad in ſeveral Countries) when he ſaith, <hi>But ye are a choſen generation, a royal Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called you out of darkneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his marvelous light, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 9. Be good Chriſtians never ſo far aſunder in time and place, yet they are all joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one choſen generation, in one royal Prieſt-hood, in one holy Nation, in one peculiar people, and the reaſon why they are ſo joyned together, is, to ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marvelous light; And this (as far as may be) they muſt all do together as one man, no leſs then did the Jews, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, Now I beſeech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (as you deſire to be thought and called Chriſtians) <hi>that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing and that there be no ſchiſms or diviſions among you, but that ye be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgement, 1 Cor.</hi> 1 10. as if he had ſaid, I beſeech you altogether to make but one man amongſt you all, in the buſineſs of Religion, but one outward man, whilſt you all ſpeak the ſame thing, and there be no ſchiſms or diviſions among you, (which is beſt done by having a ſet and known form of prayer) and but one inward man, whilſt you are perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind and in the ſame judgement; he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the Day, that they may throw it down in the Duty, making it their buſineſs to diſcountenance the ſolemn exerciſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in common Prayer, to diſadvantage Gods publike worſhip and ſervice, to diſgrace his Miniſters, to defile his ordinances, to revile, and contemn, and pollute his Sanctuaries; whereas in truth, theſe are all alike ſanctified to the hallowing of Gods name by vertue of the fourth Commandment; and if we will needs make a ſeparation betwixt the letter and the end or reaſon of that commandment, where God hath made a moſt ſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, we muſt give the pre-eminence and ſuperiority, not to the circumſtances, or adjuncts, but to the ſubſtance of Religion; The Jew in his typical worſhip, was firſt to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Time, the Place, the Perſon, as the Sabbath, the Temple, the Prieſt, which were the adjuncts of his worſhip, and then, to offer his ſacrifice, which was the ſubſtance of it.</p>
                           <p>But the Chriſtian in his moral worſhip, is firſt to look after ſubſtance, then after circumſtances, though he hath commiſſion to neglect neither, but rather hath expreſs command to look after both; Nay indeed the Jew <hi>himſelf</hi> was to do this in his moral worſhip, even to prefer the Subſtance before the circumſtance; for we find that <hi>Ezra</hi> did read in the book of the Law, and bleſſed the Lord the great God, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple anſwered <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> with lifting up their hands, and they bowed their heads and worſhipped the Lord with their faces to the ground; <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 5, 6. All theſe were acts of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral worſhip, and accordingly we find them not confined to the Temple, for its evident They were all performed before the Street that was before the water-gate, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. And it is as evident that the duties of Preaching and Praying were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by the Jews in their Synagogues, whereas their ſacrifices were offered only in the Temple; The reaſon we may conceive was this, Becauſe their Typical worſhip was to continue but for a time, and to ſhew it deſerved not to continue for ever; there was in it this kind of abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the acceſſory did draw the Principal, the Temple the Sacrifice, the Circumſtance the Subſtance: But their moral wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was to continue for ever, and therefore in that the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall was to draw the acceſſories, the ſubſtance the circumſtances, bleſſing the Lord the great God, bowing the head and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

                           <p>This was the main ſubject of Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.

And the Jews themſelves who call the Sabbath the foundation of the Decalogue, becauſe the precept of the ſabbath was given before the reſt, (for that was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given in the wilderneſs of Zin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. where as the reſt were not given till they came to Mount Sinai, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.) yet do ingenuouſly confeſs that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not keep the Sabbath; ſo ſaith <hi>Hospinian,</hi> (who yet was very zealous for the Sabbath) <hi>Judaei ipſi in minori expoſitione in Geneſin, arbitrantur</hi> Abrahamum <hi>non obſervaſſe Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> The Jews themſelves in the leſſer expoſition upon Geneſis, do think that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not keep the Sabbath.

We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put a diſtinction between circumſtances and ſubſtances in Religion; for though both are to go hand in hand to do their homage to Almighty God, yet ſubſtances are to have the upper hand; And this appears plainly by our Saviours own determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the like caſe, even concerning Tithes; for Tithes and the Sabbath are alike moral; if what is numeral be moral in the one, how can it be leſs then moral in the other?

Again, the ſame Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, the end of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is charity, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. not excluding what he had ſaid before of Chriſt, but including it: Let us ſay ſo too, and we ſhall not eaſily ſin againſt the ſubordinate end of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which is the ſalvation of man by Chriſt; we ſhall not ſin againſt Chriſtian communion, by having no Liturgie. For what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid of the Law or Commandment in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that muſt we ſay of this Law, of this Commandment in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, The end of it is Chriſt, and the end of it is charity: For the end of it is twofold; Firſt, the exerciſe of the true Chriſtian Religion, that God may be glorified in Chriſt for our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Secondly, the eſtabliſhment of true Chriſtian communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that man may be edified, and brought to the knowledge and enjoyment of his Redeemer. And all thoſe Texts in the Old and New Teſtament, which concern the publick worſhip of God, are ſo many interpretations of the twofold end of this commandment; as for example, in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 95 (which was made to be uſed in publick aſſemblies, according to <hi>Aben Ezra's</hi> gloſs) commandeth ſinging to the Lord, and worſhipping of him, there's the exerciſe of Religion, <hi>q. d.

there's the communion: <hi>It is he that hath made us, and not we our ſelves,</hi> there's the reaſon of both, from our Creation; <hi>For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlaſting, &amp;c.</hi> there's that reaſon further enlarged to us Chriſtians from our redemption; who are taught that God by his ſon both made the worlds, and alſo purged our ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 3.

                           <p>So then without queſtion the end of the Commandment is the firſt thing to be conſidered; for if the end be rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, the letter will not eaſily be miſtaken; for the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                           <p>This was the fault which our bleſſed Saviour did find with the Scribes and Phariſees interpretations of the Law, that they interpreted it not in its full extent or latitude; and this made him ſo often in one Chapter uſe theſe words, <hi>Ye have heard it hath been ſaid of old, But I ſay unto you, &amp;c.</hi> not oppoſing his authority againſt the authority of God, who gave the Law, but againſt the authority of the Scribes and Phariſees, who miſinterpreted it: As for example, God had ſaid thou ſhalt not kill, they intepreted this Law only of the act of murder; our Saviour interprets it alſo of the intent or occaſion of it; of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the heart, and of calumny in the tongue: Again, God had ſaid thou ſhalt not commit adultery, this the Scribes and Phariſees reſtrained to the act of fornication or adultery, but our Saviour tells us plainly that God meant otherwiſe, and forbad not only the act, but alſo the inclination thereto, <hi>luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> nay the occaſion thereof, <hi>looking on a woman to luſt after her, Mat.</hi> 5. 28.</p>

by the Hebrew inſcription on the ninty ſecond <hi>Pſalm, A Pſalm for the Sabbath,</hi> becauſe, ſaith <hi>Jarchi</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> both, they were to ſay that Pſalm on the Sabbath; And <hi>Muſculus</hi> ſaith the ſame after them, <hi>concinendus in Eccleſia die Sabbathi,</hi> this Pſalm was to be ſung in the aſſemblies on the Sabbath; Nay the Pſalmiſt ſaith as much, being nothing elſe but an invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to praiſe the name of God for all his works, moſt eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the wonderful diſpenſations of his power in pulling down his enemies, and of his mercy in relieving and upholding his ſervants: So again, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 102. hath this inſcription, <hi>A prayer for the afflicted when he is over-whelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the Lord,</hi> which plainly ſheweth that the Pſalms were made to be uſed not only as publick, but alſo as private devotions, and conſequently that ſet forms do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Spirit of prayer, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt commandeth the uſe of this Pſalm to the afflicted, not for the hinderance, but for the furtherance of his devotion; not only as a prayer, but alſo as a prayer fit to pour out his complaint before the Lord: And tis clear our bleſſed Saviour hath ſaid concerning his own moſt holy prayer, not only, <hi>after this manner therefore pray (Mat.</hi> 6. 9.) commending it for our direction, but alſo, <hi>when ye pray, ſay Our Father, (Luke</hi> 11. 2.) commanding it for our uſe; not only giving this prayer to his Church as a pattern for Liturgie, or publick worſhip, but alſo as a part of it; which is alſo true of the whole Book of God, ſince thoſe words being a part of the Scripture, cannot be of any private interpretation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. So that God hath provided for himſelf a Lamb for a burnt offering, in giving his Scriptures to his Church; for in them are not only rules of worſhipping, but alſo forms of worſhip; ſuch rules as equally oblige all; ſuch forms as equally concern all the Chriſtians in the world.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, publick worſhip muſt alſo be publick in its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts, not only in one adjunct of Time, (though that happily be more particularly named, becauſe it is the moſt univerſal or common adjunct, wherein all the habitable world can at once communicate together) but alſo in the other adjuncts of place and perſon; God will have his publick places to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in, his publick perſons to be worſhipded by, as well as his publick day; and all thoſe Texts in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:114933:265"/>
which ſpeak of places or perſons deputed to Gods publick worſhip, do belong to the letter of this fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as thoſe which ſpeak of the day.</p>
                           <p>Thus hath God himſelf ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my ſanctuary, I am the Lord, Lev.</hi> 19. 30. Here is the ſame reaſon given for reverencing the Sanctuary, as for keeping the Sabbath, and not to do the one, as well as the other, is a contempt of God; And leſt we ſhould think this injunction did only concern the Tabernacle or the Temple of the Jews, the reverence is evidently communicated to more then one San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, <hi>Lev. 21. 23. That he prophane not my Sanctuaries, for I the Lord do ſanctifie them;</hi> God owns the ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Place as well as of time for his worſhip, and forbids us to prophane the one as well as the other: Thus as we find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complaints in the Prophets againſt thoſe that prophaned the Day, ſo we find many in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> againſt thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned the place of Gods publick worſhip, as <hi>Pſalm 74. 8. They have ſet fire upon thy holy places, and have defiled the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place of thy name,</hi> and ver. 9. <hi>They have burnt up all the houſes of God in the land;</hi> and they that did this, are called Gods enemies, fooliſh people, and blaſphemers, <hi>verſe 19. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked, and how the fooliſh people have blaſphemed thy name.</hi> God owneth to have houſes as well as days; and if our Saviours example may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us, we ſhall be as zealous for his Houſes as for his Days: He would not ſuffer that any man ſhould carry any veſſel through the Temple, <hi>Mark</hi> 11. 16. (and yet he here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed his Diſciples for plucking the ears of corn on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.) and he gives a reaſon for it that concerns Chriſtians who are of all Nations, and not only <hi>Jews</hi> who were but of one Nation, for he ſaith, <hi>Is it not written, my houſe ſhall be called of all Nations the houſe of prayer?</hi> Which words plainly ſhew that all Nations are to ſet apart Houſes of prayer, and that God hath an intereſt or propriety in thoſe Houſes, (ſo ſet apart) they are his houſes; which cauſed Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay to the <hi>Corinthians, What, have ye not houſes to eat and to drink, or deſpiſe ye the Church of God? 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 22. Where is a plain contradiſtinction betwixt mens houſes and Gods Houſe, they may not do the ſame offices in both; Their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral

food they muſt take in their own houſes, their ſpiritual food only in Gods houſe; and they who do otherwiſe, are ſaid to deſpiſe the Church of God, which is here put as a term convertible with the Houſe of God, or is imporperly oppoſed to their own houſes: And indeed the context requires this expoſition, <hi>when ye come together in the Church, ver.</hi> 18. Is thus afterwards explained, <hi>when ye come together in one place, ver.</hi> 20. For it is evident that if the place of their meeting had not been firſt determined, and known, they could never have met together; and what is the determining of a place to holy meetings, but the exempting or ſeparating it from prophane or common uſes?</p>
                           <p>Therefore the Canon Law ſaith expreſly, that all men know there was a conſecration of places from the beginning, who know the precepts of the Old and New Teſtament; (<hi>de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecr. diſt. 1. cap.</hi> 1.) and accordingly proves it was ſo among the Jews, and ought to be ſo among the Chriſtians: <hi>Iudaei er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go loca, in quibus ſacrificabant Domino, Divinis habebant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicationibus conſecrata, nec in aliis quam Deo dicatis locis mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera Domino offerebant: ſi enim Iudaei, qui nmbrae legis deſervie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, haec faciebant, multo magis nos, &amp;c.</hi> The Jews did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate thoſe places by prayers and ſupplications, in which they offered their ſacrifices: And if they who had only the ſhadow of the Law were ſo zealous and carefull about the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their worſhip, how much more ought we ſo to be who enjoy the ſubſtance of the Goſpel, and the very Sun-ſhine of Grace? For ſure our worſhip being more holy then theirs, cannot have leſs claim to the beauty of holineſs: And the ſame was alſo the Judgement of the Greek Church, in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ages of it, as appears by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Apology to the Emperour <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> making many excuſes for himſelf, that he had held a religious Aſſembly in the great Church newly build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, <gap reason="foreign">

Thereby ſhewing it was not ſuperſtition but true Religion which firſt taught men to perform holy duties, not only on Holy-days, but alſo in holy Places.</p>
                           <p>And yet we have not quite explained the letter of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, for it alſo requires holy perſons, as well as times and places, for a holy worſhip: Nay we find Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip performed in a common or unholy place, <hi>Nehem. 8. 1. In the ſtreet before the water-gate,</hi> but not by a common or unholy perſon, for it was performed by <hi>Ezra</hi> the Scribe. And we find our bleſſed Saviour and his Diſciples ſometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extraordinary occaſions, preaching and praying publickly, neither in the Synagogues nor on the Sabbaths, that is, neither in conſecrated places, nor on conſecrated Days, to ſhew the work it ſelf had a holineſs incommenſurable with, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unconfinable to either; but ſtill we find only them who were without doubt conſecrated perſons, publickly preaching and praying; we find no unholy or unconſecrated perſons in all the Book of God either authorized or allowed to do this Work of God, which immediately concerneth his publick worſhip: But on the contrary it is ſaid expreſly, <hi>The Lord ſeparated the tribe of Levi to bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, to ſtand before the Lord, to Miniſter unto him, and to bleſs in his name unto this day, Deut.</hi> 10. 8, Thoſe whom the Lord had not ſeparated, durſt not meddle with the Ark of his Covenant, nor ſtand before the Lord to Miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and to bleſs in his name: One <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> that was not of this ſeparated tribe, was ſtruck dead for taking hold of Gods Ark, though it were with a good intent, to ſuſtain it when the Oxen ſhook it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6, 7. And we cannot ſay that this was not written for our learning, unleſs we will twice contradict Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> not only in the general <hi>Theſis,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Now all theſe things happened unto them for enſamples, and they are written for our admonition, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 11. but alſo in this very particular hypotheſis, when he ſaith, <hi>No man taketh this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron;
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:114933:267"/>
ſo alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made an High Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5. In which words though he confine not the Prieſthood to the tribe of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> of which <hi>Aaron</hi> was, for he ſaith that Chriſt was an high Prieſt, who was of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> yet he confines it to the calling of God, for he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made an High Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, thou art my Son.</hi> If Chriſt would not glorifie himſelf by taking the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, till he was called of God, then ſurely no Chriſtian can do the office of a Prieſt without being called, but he muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey God, and diſhonour Chriſt; and to countenance any man that doth ſo, muſt needs be both ungodly and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; much more to diſcountenance thoſe whom God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and who do not their own, but his work; Miniſtring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unto him, (exactly according as himſelf hath preſcribed both in Worſhip, and Word, and Sacraments) and bleſſing in his name and by his authority: If we will needs expel theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, what do we elſe but expel our own Bleſſing? Sure we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny but our Saviour Chriſt hath given unto his Miniſters the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, (for the Keys which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed only to Saint <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 16. 19. He gave to all his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>John</hi> 20. 23.) Nay alſo the Keys of the Kingdom of Hell, for ſo thoſe whom he had ſent out, return with joy, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Lord, even the Devils are ſubject unto us through thy name, Luke</hi> 10. 17. And how then can we diſturb thoſe Miniſters whom he hath ſent, without grievouſly ſinning againſt his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and dangerouſly ſinning againſt our own ſouls? For what is this in effect, but to ſhut up Heaven, and to open Hell, but to keep out God, and to let in Devils? Tell me if you can, why men are not now ſo frequently poſſeſſed with Devils, as they were before the coming of Chriſt, but only becauſe Chriſt hath given his Church power over them; And if we will needs beat down his Church, why ſhould not the Devils again recover their former power of poſſeſſing men?</p>
                           <p>This we have found true by ſad experience, that ſince we have forſaken our Church which prayed God <hi>to beat down Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan under our feet,</hi> God hath let Satan get up even over our heads; <hi>Angelis malis duplex poenalis convenit locus; Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus pro ipſorum culpa in quem omnes poſt diem judicii detruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

                           <p>God hath ſet the Devils over our Heads in reſpect of Place; But tis only our contempt of God can ſet the Devils over our heads in reſpect of power: And the contempt of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters comes very neer the contempt of God, for ſo himſelf hath taught us, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me Luk</hi> 10. 16.</p>
                           <p>What is it then? I will take heed of ſinning againſt the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but much more againſt the end of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I will take heed of ſinning againſt the circumſtances, but much more againſt the ſubſtance that is required in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Religion; I will glorifie God in the Sabbath Day, that is, in all the adjuncts or ſolemnity, but I will much more glorifie him in the Sabbath Duty, that is, in the ſubſtance (or form) of his publick worſhip.</p>
                           <p>I will firſt make ſure of my Religion, then of my Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; firſt of my Liturgie, then of my Company; firſt of Eſſentials, then of Ceremonials: I know they are bleſſed that dwel in thy houſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 84. 4. But withal that this is the reaſon of their bleſſing, <hi>They will be alwayes praiſing thee;</hi> Great is the bleſſing of Chriſtian Communion whereby men dwell in Gods houſe, but greater is the bleſſing of Chriſtian Religion, whereby men are alwayes praiſing God; I will not willingly ſin againſt thy houſe, but above all I will not ſin againſt thy praiſe; I will not caſt them out of thine houſe, whom thou haſt commanded to dwell in it, that they may be always praiſing thee, (<hi>Pſalm</hi> 134. 2.) much leſs will I caſt thee out of thine own houſe by diſturbing thy praiſes</p>
                           <p>If others will not forſake their falſe Churches to come to the true worſhip of God, what ſhall I anſwer at the laſt day, if I forſake a true Church, to ſet up a falſe worſhip? If they ſo

highly prize a Religion that is in part againſt thee, a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is in part without thee, for which they can produce only ſome few ſpecious pretence; what will become of me if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard neither thy Religion, nor thy Communion, for which I have ſo many unqueſtionable arguments, or rather ſo many irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Demonſtrations?</p>
                           <p>I will then be very zealous for that Chriſtian Communion, wherein I am ſure I have the true Chriſtian Religion, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not oppoſe ſuch a Communion becauſe of its authority, but I ſhall be guilty of faction; nor becauſe of its excellency, but I ſhall be guilty of Blaſphemy; nor becauſe of its ſincerity, but I ſhall be guilty of Irreligion; And I cannot be either Factious, or Blaſphemous, or Irreligious (much leſs all three together) but I ſhall ſin grievouſly againſt the glory of my God, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly againſt the good of my neighbour, dangerouſly againſt the ſalvation of mine own ſoul.</p>
                           <p>In a word, ſince God (of his infinite goodneſs, which I could not deſerve, may not abuſe) hath made me an Iſraelite, I will not ſtrive to make my ſelf an <hi>Idumaean,</hi> a <hi>Babylonian,</hi> or an <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian;</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> finds all theſe three in one perſecutor or oppoſer of that Church which profeſſeth and practiceth the true Chriſtian Religion, ſaying thus, <hi>Herodiana malitia, &amp; Babylonica crudelitas eſt naſcentem extinguere velle Religionem, &amp; allidere parvulos Iſrael; Si quid enim ad ſalutem pertinens, ſi quid Religionis oritur, quicunque reſiſtit, quicunque repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, planè cum Aegyptiis parvulos Iſraelitici germinis neca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re conatur, imo cum Herode naſcentem perſequitur ſalvatorem;</hi> It is the malice of a <hi>Herod,</hi> (who was an <hi>Idumaean,</hi>) and no leſs then <hi>Babylonian</hi> cruelty to labour to ſuppreſs Religion, and to daſh the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt the ſtones: For if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what is brought forth doth conduce to ſalvation, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to true piety, who ever reſiſteth or oppoſeth it, doth plainly endeavour with the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> to ſlay the young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nay with <hi>Herod</hi> he doth ſeek out his new born Saviour to deſtroy him; And he that doth this, forgets all the curſes denounced againſt <hi>Edom</hi> in the Prophets for perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> particularly that of <hi>Obadiah, v. 10.

Duty, which is to do all in remembrance of Chriſt; to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie our Redeemer in the firſt place, and for his ſake to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the memorials of our Redemption; Thus hath holy <hi>Zachary</hi> taught us to ſing, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael; and hath given this reaſon of that ſong, <hi>For he hath viſited and redeemed his people, Luke</hi> 1. 68.

                           <p>The Chriſtians Religion, though betwixt that of the Jews and that of the Angels, yet comes neerer to that of the Angels, and therefore may not look backwards to Nature, but muſt look forwards to glory: The Author of nature did bid the Jews firſt number dayes, ſaying, <hi>For in ſix dayes the Lord made heaven and earth, and reſted the ſeventh day; wherefore the Lord bleſſed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day and hallowed it;</hi> There the day called for the duty: But the Author of Grace hath bid the Chriſtian firſt number Duties, teaching him to ſay, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,

<pb n="499" facs="tcp:114933:270"/>
of that communion; For as God hath not left his people to make their own communion, ſo neither hath he left his Church to make her own Religion; He firſt ſaith, <hi>Let all things be done,</hi> then let all things <hi>be done decently and in order, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 40. He firſt provides the doctrines, then regulates the Prophets or the Preachers; firſt takes care for the order of Religion, then takes care for the order of Communion: He firſt taught his Church how to invocate and implore his mercy, how to reverence, and adore his Majeſty, how to acknowledge his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and glorifie his holy name in worſhip, in word, in Sacraments, and after that how to order aſſemblies and publick meetings for theſe Invocations, for theſe adorations, for theſe acknowledgements or glorifications.</p>
                           <p>And hence it is that Chriſtian Religion bids all men firſt look after Gods authority in his word, then after Gods autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in his Church; So that no Church can be obliged (by the obedience which ſhe oweth to the Chriſtian Faith) to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with that Church which abſolutely refuſeth to have the doctrines and duties of its communion regulated and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the known and undoubted written word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every man ought firſt to chooſe his Religion, whereby to have communion with Chriſt, then the Profeſſion or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it, whereby to have communion with Chriſts Church: And by conſequent, for any company of men to advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the word, is to incurre Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> cenſure, <hi>If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholeſome words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the doctrine which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Godlineſs, he is proud, knowing nothing, but d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In ſuch a caſe the breach of Chriſtian communion is to be imputed to thoſe who conſent not to the words of Chriſt; for if they break off from Chriſt, it is no ſin, can be no ſhame in others to break off from them; For the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>from ſuch withdraw thy ſelf:</hi> So that it is evident the breach of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Communion may be cauſal in a falſe Religion, as well as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal in an unjuſt ſeparation; And all the world is not able to excuſe the formal, unleſs it be from the cauſal breach, ſince

no man can have a pretence to leave the Church, unleſs it be to cleave to Chriſt; to forſake the Chriſtian commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, unleſs it be to follow the Chriſtian Religion: Therefore where Religion is moſt ſincerely kept, there communion is moſt ſinfully and moſt ſhamefully broken. For if the Church hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed taught us the right Invocation and Adoration of God, and a right profeſſion to glorifie his moſt holy name, according to the three firſt Commandments, How doth it not bind us to its communion in all theſe according to the fourth? If we cannot deny the purity, how dare we deny the publike exerciſe of our Religion? For ſurely he that will one day ſay <hi>Depart from me ye curſed,</hi> to thoſe who have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly neglected their duty towards their neighbours, will never ſay, <hi>Come ye bleſſed,</hi> to us if we wilfully neglect our duty towards our God; but our peeviſhneſs now ſaying, unto him in effect Depart from us Thou bleſſed, will then moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be recompenced with his Juſtice ſaying unto us, Depart from me ye curſed; Our departure from him is now voluntary, it will then be neceſſary; it is now our ſin, it will then be our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: For if we ſhall be condemned for our omiſſions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our brethren, much more ſhall we be condemned for our omiſſions, or rather for our contempts towards our Saviour; And thoſe <hi>Jehu's</hi> which drive furiouſly, not to throw down the worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> but of the true everliving God, ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt anſwer at the laſt day not only for their furiouſneſs, as guilty of Schiſm, but alſo for their contempt, as guilty of profaneſs; not only for their breaking the Chriſtian communion, but alſo for their oppoſing the Chriſtian Religion; they cannot ſet up the abomination of deſolation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Holy place, and pull down holineſs from thence, but themſelves will be in Gods account abominable and deſolate.

                           <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not think his authority confined with his Perſon, when being a priſoner at <hi>Rome</hi> he did write to <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> at <hi>Coloſs,</hi> calling upon him for <hi>the effectual communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his faith, ver.</hi> 6. and telling him, that he was to be <hi>Miniſtred unto in the bonds of the Goſpel, ver.</hi> 13. and requiring him to put ſome wrongs and loſſes upon his account, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. and all upon this ground, <hi>Thou oweſt unto me even thine own ſelf beſides, ver.</hi> 19.

my preſent purpoſe; and it may be enough for others future certainty and conſtancy in their Religion, that all the Chriſtians that were ſaved for one thouſand and five hundred years after Chriſt, were ſaved without the neceſſary belief of thoſe additional articles; And it is clear that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf denyed not anciently her communion to other Churches, if ſo be they profeſſed and maintained only that faith which was declared in the known and received Creeds of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church; for ſo <hi>Optatus Milevitanus</hi> teſtifieth, that all the Churches of the world did hold communion among themſelves, and with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by vertue of their communicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry letters: His words are theſe, <hi>lib. 2. contra Parm. c. 7.

worſhip or devotion, ſo that if all Chriſtian Churches Believed, and prayed, and adminiſtred exactly according to the rule of this Faith, it would not be poſſible for any man to be a Schiſmatick in denying his communion, without firſt being a Heretick in denying his Religion: For if I am required <hi>to call only upon him in whom I have believed,</hi> and <hi>to do this only in remembrance of him</hi> on whom I am bound to call, how can I deny my communion either in Prayers or in Sacraments to any Chriſtian Church, and not deny the faith that hath been taught me by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church?

whereas they cannot be good Chriſtians, if they have not a Theological certainty of the ſucceſsion of their Doctrine; for he that believes the truth, not knowing it to be true, and to have proceeded from the God of truth, is not formally, but only materially a true Believer, and leaves himſelf in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, if he doth not put himſelf into a diſpoſition, to believe a lye: For by the ſame reaſon that he can beſtow his Faith upon an uncertainty, He may alſo beſtow it upon a Falſity.</p>

neither as lame, nor as blind, nor as perverſe, nor as ignorant, nor as falſe, but an excellent creature, made to know and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his maker; So though I ſee many defects and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in particular Churches, (<hi>for in many things we offend all,</hi> men and Churches too) yet I conſider the Catholick Church, or the Church in general, neither as defective, nor as imperfect, but as the body and Spouſe of Chriſt, holy and undefiled, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot, called to the knowledge of God here in this world, and to the enjoyment of him hereafter in the world to come; And if all men would look more upon the perfections then upon the defects of the Churches wherein they live, if they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look upon what Chriſt hath made them, then what they have made themſelves, the world would be more given to devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then now it is to diſputes, and would be more filled with Religion, then it is now with faction: For Chriſt is ſo well preached in every true Chriſtian Church, notwithſtanding the great corruptions and diviſions of Chriſtendom, that if he were but half ſo well practiſed, we ſhould moſt of us ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very good Chriſtians: And truly we can ſcarce give a better reaſon why State policy and ſelf-intereſt hath not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally corrupted the principles, as it hath the Practiſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but only that thoſe who ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> his chair, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerned in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Truſt, which was this, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſpeak all that I command thee, Exod.</hi> 7. 2.

                           <p>When the Miniſters ſhall be like ſo many ſtatues in a doubtful Road, directing the travellers in the right way, but themſelves not moving therein at all; The compariſon is not much amiſs: For as it is not from the ſubſtance of the ſtatue, but from its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or employment that men are directed by it; ſo is it alſo in the Miniſters; tis not from their perſons, but from their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that they are ſo highly qualified, as to be our guides to heaven; And as men can make a ſtock, ſo much more God can make a man diſcharge the office of a faithful guide; And as the rottenneſs of the ſtatue hinders not the ſoundneſs of its directions, ſo a Miniſter that hath a falſe and a rotten heart, may have a true (and a ſound) mouth; And as the traveller thanks not the ſtatue for his good directions, but thoſe that ſet it there: ſo we are not to thank ſuch a Miniſter for his good directions, but God that ſet him over us; For if the efficacity and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a good Inſtrument be aſcribed to the efficient cauſe, then much more of a bad inſtrument; And if ſuch holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>John</hi> rebuked the amazed Jews af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, <hi>Why look ye ſo earneſtly on us, as though by our own power or holineſs we had made this man to walk, Act.</hi> 3. 12. then we may be ſure that when words of power or of truth proceed from the mouth of a wicked <hi>Caiaphas; That he ſpake not this of himſelf, but being High Prieſt that year, he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, John</hi> 11. 51. And as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> though he was not a true man, yet he was a true Prophet, becauſe in that reſpect he was Gods Truſtee for the propagation of that truth which he then propheſied; So is it ſtill with many Chriſtian Miniſters and Churches, as they are Gods Truſtees for preſerving and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the ſaving truths of the Goſpel, ſo they are enabled by his Spirit to diſcharge that Truſt; in ſo much that we may take it for granted, that God hath entruſted them, becauſe we cannot deny but God hath enabled them: For if he had not given them a Truſt, why ſhould he either give them Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

after once it was made appear by the Teſtimony of thoſe Churches, where the Authentick Copies of them had been depoſited, that they had been indicted by ſome Apoſtle, or approved by ſome Apoſtolical man; till then, they were queſtioned, in regard of their Authors, if not in regard of their Authority, but after that, they were queſtioned in regard of neither; ſo great a confidence did God repoſe in particular Churches, that it is evident he entruſted them with his own Word to keep it, to witneſs it, and to explain it; as the Church of the Jews with the Old Teſtament, (which Church though it were Catholick or univerſal in its Doctrine, yet was it meerly particular or national in its extent; for he <hi>ſhewed his word to</hi> Jacob, <hi>his ſtatutes and ordinances unto Iſrael; he had not dealt ſo with any Nation, neither had the Heathen knowledge of his Laws, Pſalm 147. ver.</hi> 19, 20.)

                           <p>GOD is very angry with a man, when he Truſts his ſoul in his own hands, for then he leaves him expoſed to the Temptations of his own concupiſcence, to the errours of his own ignorance, to the ſlips and ſtumblings of his own infirmity, to the precipices and downfalls of his own preſumption, and to the bondage and thraldom of his own corruption: Therefore we juſtly extoll the power and goodneſs of God in our preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no leſs then in our Creation, and himſelf thinks it no leſs honourable to keep a ſoul then to make it; and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth him God our Saviour, thrice in one Epiſtle, <hi>By the Commandment of God our Saviour,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 1. <hi>This is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 3. <hi>We truſt in the living God who is the Saviour of all men, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of thoſe that believe, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 10.

The Text ſaith, Gods ſupream Dominion over all, is the reaſon why he is willing to ſhew mercy unto all, and how ſhall we ſay his Dominion over all is the reaſon that he hath excluded much the greateſt part from mercy? Let us ſeriouſly conſider this, and we will never quarrel with our Church for teaching us this prayer, <hi>That is may pleaſe thee to have mercy upon all men:</hi> For in truth God himſelf is Originally the general Paſtor of ſouls, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The Lord is my Shephard, therefore can I lack nothing;</hi> A Pſalm made concerning all Iſrael, ſaith <hi>Kimchi,</hi> that they ſhould ſay ſo when they go out of captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; we need not change, but only rectifie his gloſs, by extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to all the Iſrael of God, and to their going out of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual captivity, the bondage of ſin and Satan; for all the ſouls that go out of this captivity, have God for their Shephard, to guide them, to feed them, to protect them; thus is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf originally the general Paſtor of ſouls, and all others that take care of ſouls are but his Subſtitutes and Curates; For he hath imparted this cure immediately to his Son, whence he is called the <hi>Shephard and Biſhop of our ſouls, 1.

But mediately, by his Son, unto his Miniſters, for ſo it is averred from Chriſts own mouth, <hi>as thou haſt ſent me into the world, even ſo have I alſo ſent them into the world, John 17. 18. viz.</hi> To take the charge and care of ſouls; And every true Church of Chriſt may borrow theſe words from her Maſters mouth, ſhould ſpeak them with his zeal, and juſtifie them with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, <hi>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world; that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the truth; John</hi> 18. 37. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="537" facs="tcp:114933:289"/>
the leſs they will let me ſpeak for the truth, the more the truth will cry out againſt them; they may bring the Martyrdom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, but they will bring the deſtruction only upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; So ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, There ſhall be falſe teachers, by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of:</hi> What then? ſhall they therefore be able to deſtroy Gods Church, the witneſs of his truth, and the Martyr for it? no, they ſhall deſtroy only themſelves, as it is ſaid in the ſame place, <hi>and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2. But as for the Church, that ſhall be preſerved, though ſo as by fire, as juſt <hi>Lot</hi> was delivered when <hi>Sodom</hi> was deſtroyed, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. Whence is inferred this Doctrinal concluſion, for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our Faith, for the eſtabliſhing of our Hope, for the inflaming of our Piety, and for the encreaſing of our Patience; <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, ver.</hi> 9. All the perſecutions that can befall the godly, though they are others ſins, yet they are only their temptations; and they that have the zeal to pray not to be led into temptation, ſhall atleaſt have this benefit of their prayers, not to be left in, but to be led out of them: They may be thought to be in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, but they are not; for <hi>the truth ſhall make them free, John</hi> 8. 32. They may be thought to be in death, but they are not; For he that is their Truth, is alſo their Life, <hi>John</hi> 14. 6. They will not be falſe to the Truth, and the Truth cannot be falſe to them; they bear witneſs to the Truth, not only for Gods ſake to obey his command, and for their own ſakes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their conſciences, but alſo for the peoples ſake, to ſave their ſouls; For the ſame muſt be the Truſtees for Gods Truth, and for the peoples ſouls, becauſe there is no way to ſave their ſouls but by his Truth; And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the Church of <hi>Epheſus, (Acts</hi> 20.) that he had diſcharged his Truſt concerning their ſouls, by teaching them the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth; for ſaith he, <hi>I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, ver,</hi> 20. Whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he preached the whole Truth: And again, <hi>But have ſhewed you and have taught you publickly and from houſe to houſe, Teſtifying both to the Jews and alſo to the Greeks, repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, and Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ver.</hi> 20. 21. Whence it is evident he preached nothing but the Truth; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:114933:290"/>
but the right practical Truth, ſuch as concerned the good ordering of this preſent life by repentance towards God; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the right ſpeculative Truth, ſuch as concerned the knowledge and enjoyment of the life to come, by Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: We ſee by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple what is to be the chief Doctrine of every particular Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church (which ſucceedeth him in the ſame Truſt and care of ſouls, even Repentance toward God, and Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and conſequently the Church is moſt truly Apoſtolical, which moſt incorruptly preacheth this doctrine of faith and repentance, and moſt zealouſly practiſeth what it preacheth; Nor may ſuch a Church be diſmayed that by this means ſhe is like to have many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, even as many enemies as there are Phariſees and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in the whole world, ready either to deride the Repentance, or to corrupt and deny the Faith, for ſo was Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>that bonds and afflictions did abide him, v.</hi> 23. yet he plainly anſwereth, (and thereby teacheth every one who ſucceedeth him in the ſame Truſt, what to anſwer) <hi>But none of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtery which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the Grace of God, v.</hi> 24. as if he had ſaid, I did not at firſt either invade or falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this Truſt, that I ſhould now betray it or forſake it; for <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> he put me in this courſe, I muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Directions; He made me his Miniſter, I muſt obey his commands; It is my courſe, I muſt run it on directly, not turning aſide either to the right hand or to the left, that I may conſult with fleſh and blood, but looking only to my journies end; It is my Miniſtry, I muſt perform it as I am enjoined, not ſeeking to pleaſe my ſelf, and much leſs any other, but only my Maſter.</p>
                           <p>Nor need we ask the Eunuchs queſtion, <hi>I pray thee of whom ſpeaketh the Prophet this? of himſelf, or of ſome other man? Acts</hi> 8. 34. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame place gives the anſwer to this queſtion, in that he alledgeth his own example, not as Perſonal but as Doctrinal, making this inference upon it, <hi>Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto your ſelves, and to all the flock over the which the Holy-Ghoſt hath made you overſers to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood, v.</hi> 28.

                           <p>Thus I have ſhewed the Truſt of the two particular Churches of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and of <hi>Crete,</hi> whoſe firſt governours immediately after the Apoſtles are nominated, licenſed, and inſtructed by the Text, and theſe two are precedents ſufficient for all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches to the worlds end; (happily more ſufficient precedents then are left in all the new Teſtament concerning any other external adjunct of Religion.) For if all Scripture be profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in righteouſneſs, <hi>That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed to all good Works, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. then ſurely much more that the Church of God may be perfect; For if Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> proof be undeniable, that becauſe God took care of an Oxe, he much more took care of a Miniſter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 10. then can we not deny but the proof is as undeniable, that
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:114933:292"/>
becauſe he took care of one particular miniſter, he much more took care of all Miniſters; if he were ſo carefull to inſtruct one man of God, (as <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi>) then much more was he carefull to inſtruct all the men of God, that is to ſay, his whole Church, which is doubtleſs accordingly to be guided by theſe Inſtructions; unleſs we can prove that ſince that time ſhe hath received any other, or that God hath repented of theſe, and is willing to let his word (as we are to let our Oaths,) grow out of date: And indeed what can we deſire to know concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Truſtees in behalf of our ſouls, which we may not eaſily know from either of theſe two Epiſtles? For we know that God the Father hath ſaid, <hi>All ſouls are mine, Ezek.</hi> 18. 4. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are ſure that none can claim, and conſequently none ſhould take the care of any ſoul but by commiſſion from him: This commiſſion he immediately gave to his only Son, with a promiſe that it ſhould conduce to the Salvation of thoſe ſouls which ſhould hear his voice; <hi>I am the good ſhephard, my ſheep hear my voice, and I give unto them eternal life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 10. 14, 27, 29. but this was by power given him from his Father, as tis ſaid, <hi>All power is given unto me, Mat.</hi> 28. and therefore when he was not yet pleaſed <hi>to own,</hi> or at leaſt not to exerciſe this power, he ſaid to the mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> children, <hi>It is not mine to give, Mat.</hi> 20. 23. But however the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe concerning this power is no where ſo clearly ſignified, as in the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> ſo we find, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 1. Paul <hi>an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, by the will of God, according to the promiſe of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> He derives his own commiſſion for taking the care of ſouls, from Chriſt; Chriſts commiſſion from God; Paul <hi>an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt by the will of God:</hi> And he ſhews the end of that commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was the ſalvation of thoſe ſouls, <hi>According to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Again, Tit. 1. 1, 2. Paul <hi>a Servant of God, and an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> there's the proof of his commiſſion; <hi>in hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie promiſed before the world began;</hi> there'<hi>s</hi> the end of his commiſſion: God promiſed eternal life before the world began: to whom could he promiſe it, but to his Son coaeternal with himſelf? and for whom did he promiſe it, but for thoſe who ſhould be his, hearkening to him, believing in him, relying on
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:114933:293"/>
him, and ſupported by him? This was the comfortable end of <hi>Saint Pauls</hi> commiſſion, and therefore we have great reaſon to look after the ſure proof of it; And that we find particularly in theſe Epiſtles Firſt as it was given from Chriſt to him, and Secondly as it was to be derived from him to others, even to the worlds end; For although there is great Truth in that rule, <hi>Delegatus non poteſt Delegare,</hi> He that hath a Truſt or power himſelf only by Delegation, cannot orderly delegate the ſame to another; and greater reaſon for it in humane affairs; becauſe the power of Delegation in Delegates muſt fill the world with irremediable uncertainties, may fill it with intolerable abuſes and miſcarriages; yet in Gods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, there is no truth in that Rule; for his Delegates may and muſt appoint other Delegates till the end of the world; and there's is reaſon for it, becauſe himſelf ſtill acteth by theſe latter Delegates as well by the former, limiting their Truſt that they may not abuſe it, as well as declaring their Truſt that we may not deny it.</p>
                           <p>Firſt we are taught particularly in theſe Epiſtles, how Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> commiſſion was given from Chriſt to him; for ſo he ſaith, <hi>The glorious Goſpel committed to my Truſt, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 11. Again, <hi>I thank the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithfull, putting me into the Miniſtery, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 12. We doubt not but he ſpeaketh this in the behalf of the other Apoſtles, as well as of himſelf, and by the ſame reaſon cannot ſee why the words ſpoken in other places to and of S. <hi>Peter</hi> alone, ſhould not belong to S. <hi>Paul</hi> and to the other Apoſtles, as well as to him.</p>
                           <p>Secondly we are taught peculiarly in the ſame Epiſtles, how Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> commiſſion was to be derived from him to others after him till the worlds end; For ſo it is ſaid, <hi>This charge I commit unto thee Son</hi> Timothy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 18. And leſt we ſhould think the Truſt was to end there, he ſaith farther; <hi>And the things that thou haſt heard of me among many witneſſes</hi> (whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Doctrine or Diſcipline of the Church) <hi>the ſame commit thou to faithfull men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 2. So there is to be no end of Teachers, till there ſhall be an end of Learners.</p>
                           <p>But it is more then time I ſhould now paſs to the Truſt which
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:114933:293"/>
God hath given to other particular Churches beſides thoſe, even to as many as his Apoſtles ſent their ſeveral Epiſtles: Thus we may ſee the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> had been entruſted by him, becauſe he ſo ſharply reproves them for not diſcharging their Truſt, and if we may believe ſome late interpreters, the reproof of thoſe Churches ſtill concern our preſent Churches; but we are ſure that if our preſent Churches be concerned in their reproof, then alſo in their Truſt, and how then can we now oppoſe thoſe Angels, whom we ſee God himſelf then entruſted in thoſe Churches? But to proceed; let us look upon S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles to ſeveral Churches, The power of excommunication is given par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> (&amp; with it doubtleſs all other ſpiritual power, whether of Order, or of Juriſdiction) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and the reaſons for it are ſuch as evince it to be ſtill given to all other particular Churches, 1. That God and his Church ſhould not be expoſed to reproach, <hi>v. 1. It is reported commonly,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That Gods people ſhould not be expoſed to infection, <hi>v. 6. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</hi> 3. That the ſinner ſhould be brought to repentance, <hi>v. 5. That the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> So again to the Churth of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> is the ſame power given; and for the ſame reaſons, though only one of them be named, 2 <hi>Theſ. 3. 14. If any man obey not our word by this Epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be aſhamed;</hi> I will give but one more inſtance, and that concerns the Chriſtian Church of the converted Jews, wherein the Miniſters are made gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, the People commanded to be ſubject to their government by the Apoſtles own expreſs Order, <hi>Heb. 13. 17. Obey them that have the rule over you, ond ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls as they that muſt give account, that they may do it with joy and not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you;</hi> where we have not only the neceſſity of this obedience to our Miniſters, they are appointed to rule us, therefore we muſt ſubmit to them, but alſo the reaſon of it, and that is twofold, 1. They watch for our ſouls; 2. They muſt give account for our ſouls: Let our eyes be opened never ſo much, yet we cannot ſufficiently watch for our ſelves, therefore God hath in mercy appointed others to watch for us: And in that God hath appointed them to be over us, it is evident he hath appointed us to be under them, and
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:114933:294"/>
conſequently as evident, that they will not be able to give a good account for our ſouls, till we our ſelves ſhall be able to give a good account of our obedience.</p>

And it is alſo evident that in this caſe every particular Church hath her particular Truſt; For ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Church of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to all other Churches,) <hi>Be ye followers of me, even as
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:114933:294"/>
I alſo am of Christ, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 1. which words are the more carefully to be obſerved, and the more conſcionably to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they are as it were the general Proeem to the Apoſtles enſuing diſcourſe concerning the right diſpoſition and order of publick aſſemblies; In which diſcourſe, he gives the Rule both for perſons, and for things, and for actions; for as the Law of man hath taken care of all theſe, ſo much more hath the Law of God taken care of them, and moſt of all in Gods own worſhip: Here the Holy Spirit will have 1. Perſons rightly ordered, preſcribing the decent behaviour both of men and women, from the firſt verſe of the eleventh Chapter to the ſixteenth. 2. Things rightly ordered, preſcribing the right ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the holy Euchariſt, from the ſixteenth verſe to the end of the Chapter; Laſtly, actions rightly ordered, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the right uſe of Spiritual gifts and Functions, in the twelfth, thirteeenth, and fourteenth Chapters: In reſpect of all theſe it is the Apoſtles injunction to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and the Churches injunction to us, <hi>Be ye followers of me, even as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo am of Chriſt;</hi> as my Church muſt ſubmit to Chriſts authority in the exerciſe of Religion to avoid ſuperſtition, ſo I muſt ſubmit to my Churches authority to avoid faction and confuſion. For what my Church requires by vertue of his command, I cannot diſobey without contempt of his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Excellently <hi>Aquinas, Majores ſive perfecti ſoli Deo inhaerent, cujus eſt immutabilis bonitas; qui et ſi inhaereant ſuis praelatis, non inhaerent illis niſi in quantum illi inhaerent Chriſto, ſecundum illud, Imitatores mei eſtote ſicut &amp; Ego Chriſti, (22. qu. 43. art. 5. c.) Thoſe that are firmly grounded, and to be called perfect Chriſtians, do in all things cleave to Chriſt himſelf, and ſtick faſt to him, whoſe goodneſs is unchangeable,</hi> (and therefore ſo is alſo their will and reſolution,) <hi>for though they rely upon the Church which Chriſt hath ſet over them, yet they relye upon their Church, as that relyeth upon Chriſt, according to that of Saint</hi> Paul, <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Chriſt;</hi> Every good Chriſtian man relies immediately upon Chriſt for his Religion, and much more every good Chriſtian Church; can you not deny me to be a Major in this caſe, and will you needs make my Church a Minor? Am I of ripe years, and muſt my Church be under age? muſt I relye upon Chriſt, and muſt not my Church
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:114933:295"/>
much rather relye upon him? There cannot be a greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, then for one man to perſwade another to leave Chriſt and ſtick to him, unleſs it be for one Church to perſwade ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do the ſame; And are not they perſwaded to leave Chriſt, who are perſwaded to leave the Holy Scriptures, that they may ſtick to uncertain Traditions? For where is Chriſt to be certainly followed but in his undoubted word? How then can any Church forſake Chriſts written word, and pretend to follow him? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cares not to be ſo authentical, and yet doubtleſs had more authority then thoſe that are ſo; He prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for keeping the Ordinances or Traditions as he had delivered them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. but he profeſſeth he had delivered no other then what he had received, <hi>For I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto you that which I alſo received, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 3. Nay in the ſame Chapter wherein he praiſeth them for keeping what he had delivered, he averreth that he had delivered what he had received, <hi>ver. 23. For I have received of the Lord, that which I alſo delivered unto you;</hi> nor is it reaſonable we ſhould imagine the Apoſtle of Chriſt would ſtand more upon his own then his Maſters honour, or would have praiſed the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> for remembring him in all things, if ſo be he had ſo groſly forgotten himſelf, as not to have remembred his Maſter; and who hath made a Church above an Apoſtle? Therefore we may be ſure that the Traditions Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gave the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> were ſuch as had been given him, and we could ſcarce be ſure of this, were not the ſame Traditions ſtill given us, and conſequently we cannot part with the leaſt degree of this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, but we muſt part with the beſt and greateſt reaſon of our praiſe; for what is, or can be the praiſe of any Church, but that ſhe remembers the Apoſtles in all things, and keeps the Traditions as they delivered them unto her; ſo that upon the certainty of the Traditions, depends the Fidelity of the Church, and thoſe Churches muſt needs approve themſelves to be moſt faithfull, which can make the ſureſt proof of their Traditions, that they are indeed truly Apoſtolical; now it is evident that the written word, is ſo acknowledged by all Churches, but the unwritten word is not ſo; and tis obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that thoſe who ſtand moſt upon the credit of unwritten Traditions, yet are of late very willing to endeavour to prove
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:114933:295"/>
moſt of the Doctrines and practices depending thereupon, by ſome Texts of the undoubted written word, ſurely not to gratifie their adverſaries who refuſed the other, but themſelves, who look upon theſe as the much better and ſurer proofs.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore the holy Scriptures which are the only proof that the Church hath a Truſt from God concerning his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, are the only Rule by which ſhe can either conſcionably, or acceptably diſcharge that Truſt; Conſcionably, in offering nothing to mens conſciences, but what God hath offered; Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably in offering nothing unto God, but what himſelf hath required; and if every particular Church did exactly follow this Rule, none could deteſt the Communion of another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deteſting the communion of God himſelf; For this is the Apoſtles own determination, <hi>I give you to underſtand that no man ſpeaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jeſus accurſed, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 3. that is, doth accurſe or deteſt any thing that is truly of the Chriſtian Religion, for that is little other then to deteſt and accurſe Chriſt Jeſus himſelf; Men may beſtow their hearts as they pleaſe about Ceremonies and formalities, and happily be charged only with indiſcretion, but not ſo about real forms of worſhip, not ſo about ſound and ſolid prayers, unleſs they will alſo be charged with irreligion; For if the prayer which is uſed by any Chriſtian Church, doth truly honour Jeſus, no other Church can deteſt her communion in that prayer, without deteſting Jeſus himſelf; Therefore it is not from the Spirit of God, but from our own ſpirits that we diſlike any thing which truly belongs to Jeſus, whether in his Doctrine or in his worſhip, and conſequently what is exactly agreeable with the known Word of Jeſus, is alſo exactly agreeable with his will, and accordingly all Churches are bound to agree in that, though they may diſagree about other matters: Therefore let every Church faithfully diſcharge her Truſt about the worſhip of God, and there may be a hope of a Chriſtian agreement among all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for then thoſe that ſhall diſagree from the reſt, will prove themſelves either Antichriſtian or unchriſtian; either Antichriſtian, as being againſt Chriſt, or unchriſtian as being without him; either faulty for having a falſe, or faulty for not having a true worſhip of Chriſt: For a true and laudable wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

cannot but challenge our communion, either actually in our corporal preſence, if we live among ſuch good Chriſtians as have it, or potentially in our ſpiritual vote and deſire, though we live never ſo far from them; And it is to be noted in Gods Method, that he firſt makes proviſion for the Truth of his worſhip, in the three firſt, then afterwards for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exerciſe of it in the fourth Commandment; he firſt takes care that we be not faulty in the object of our worſhip, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me,</hi> then not in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward manner of it, either in deed, or in word; not in deed, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven image, thou ſhalt not how down to them nor worſhip them;</hi> not in word, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain;</hi> After this order taken for the truth of his worſhip both in the object and in the manner, then he proceeds to command the publick exerciſe thereof, ſaying, <hi>Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day:</hi> Certainly this Method was not in vain, but to ſhew that as the Truth was to go before the exerciſe, ſo the exerciſe was to follow the Truths of Religion; And therefore whereſoever the Church did worſhip God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dictates of the three firſt commandments, there eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man was bound to be a communicant with the Church by vertue of the fourth, and not only by vertue of the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; For Chriſtian communion as an act of Religion, belongs to the firſt, though as an act of obedience it belong to the ſecond Table; Therefore if another man ſaith, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which art in heaven;</hi> how ſhall I not ſay with him, <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed be thy name?</hi> Doth it beſeem me to be angry with the Lords moſt holy prayer for his ſake that ſaith it, as if what Chriſts lips had ſanctified, his lips could prophane, for my devotion? Or can I be angry with any of Chriſts words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I find them, and not be guilty of anger againſt Chriſt, and againſt Chriſtianity? Is the love of my God to be over-ruled by the hatred of my neighbour, or may I indeed hate my God for my neighbours ſake, who am bound to love mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for Gods ſake? The argument then will proceed <hi>à mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nori ad majus,</hi> that if I may not in a true worſhip deny my communion to a ſtranger, much leſs to a brother; if not to a brother, then much leſs to a mother; If not to one ſingle

Miniſter, much leſs to a whole Church, which God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with his own worſhip, and with my ſoul: For if I muſt look on that particular Miniſter whom God hath ſet over me, as one that directeth me in his worſhip by his authority, then much more muſt I ſo look upon my Church, which God firſt ſet over that Miniſter, before he ſet that Miniſter over me: And if every particular Miniſter amongſt us would as conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably acknowledge, and as couragiouſly vindicate his Churches Truſt, as he confidently aſſumes and diligently performs his own, we ſhould ſoon have much leſs faction in the Church, and much more Religion in the people.</p>

For as an Angel of God, ſo is my Lord the King, to diſcern good and bad;</hi> And tis very probable the ſame reaſon is meant, though it be not given, why the Prieſts are ſo called, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. For we find the Angels of thoſe ſeveral Churches ſtrictly examined, if not ſeverely blamed for the neglect of this Truſt; God hath made Kings and Prieſts guardians of his truth, as he hath made the Angels guardians of our perſons, that we ſhould admire his infinite power whereby he is able, and adore his infinite goodneſs whereby he is willing, not only to ſend down from heaven his Miniſtring Spirits, but alſo to raiſe up from earth, his Miniſtring fleſh to be our guardian Angels: Nor can we now without unthankfulneſs to God, injury to the Truth, and injuſtice (if not uncharitableneſs) to our ſelves, deny either King or Prieſt his part in this guardianſhip: And God he knows, we have great need of both.</p>
                           <p>It hath been the Devils cheifeſt policy to ſow ſeeds of jealouſie and diſſenſion between theſe two Truſtees, that ſo he might make himſelf the greater harveſt, either by depraving the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or by diſturbing the peace of Religion: In ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Prieſt hath almoſt expelled the King; in other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the King hath almoſt expelled the Prieſt; The one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his ſpirituals even to temporals, the other extending his temporals even to ſpirituals, neither but cometh ſhort of his

duty, whiles both go beyond their Truſt; God make both truly to ſee the danger and the burden of their own Truſt, and neither will care to invade what belongs to the other, but both will ſoon ſee ſo much belonging to himſelf, as to deſire no more.</p>
                           <p>But in matters of Religion the Princes Truſt hath of late been moſt diſputed, though the Prieſts Truſt hath been leaſt obeyed; For indeed the Prieſts riſing againſt the Prince, hath taught the People to riſe againſt the Prieſt; &amp; Prince, &amp; Prieſt, and People, have all in a manner riſen againſt God. Hence it is we find ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny broken lineaments in the face of Religion, &amp; ſo great ruptutes in the body of it, all rebellion in States, all Schiſm in Churches proceeding from this miſcheivous reſolution, that inferiours to compaſs their own ends, do make it no ſhame, and would fain make it no ſin, either impudently to oppoſe, or if that will not ſerve the turn, Impiouſly to uſurp their Superiours Truſt: The firſt great breach was, the Prieſt would have no King; the Second great breach is, The People will have no Prieſt: God keep us from the third, that King, and Prieſt, and People will have no God.

Kings when they are in any error, make laws for that error againſt the Truth; When they are in the Truth, they make laws for the truth againſt error; So good men are tried by wicked laws, and wicked men are mended by good laws: King Nebuchodonoſor being yet in his perverſneſs, made a law for his image to be worſhipped; But being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amended, made as ſevere a law that the true God ſhould not be blaſphemed; For in this thing, Kings do God ſervice as Kings, according to his own command, if in their dominions they

require what is good, and forbid what is evil; and that not only in regard of humane ſociety, but alſo in regard of Divine Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> Thus he plainly affirmed Kings to be Gods Truſtees, not only in regard of the ſecond, but alſo of the firſt Table of the Decalogue, though as long as they remained wicked Kings, they did only abuſe their Truſt; So likewiſe Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his Commentaries upon <hi>Luke</hi> 5. calleth it <hi>magnum &amp; ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale documentum,</hi> a great and ſpiritual point of Divinity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſtians are taught ſubjection to the higher powers, not to break the conſtitutions of their earthly Princes; and he proves it to be ſo, for that Chriſt himſelf paid tribute: The argument is irrefragable, from Chriſt to the Chriſtian, from the Son of God to the ſervant of God; If he ſhewed his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, who can give us leave to be diſobedient, or pardon us for being ſo?</p>
                           <p>So likewiſe Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his Commentaries upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> (cap. 13.) tells us, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> requireth Prieſts and Monks to be ſubject as well as other men, in that he ſaith, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher power;</hi> yea though thou wert an Apoſtle, (ſaith he) or an Evangeliſt, <gap reason="foreign">

(2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 3.) though he left the Prieſts to diſcharge their own office, yet he thought the external Polity both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical within the reach and compaſs of his Regal power; And accordingly he conſtituted not only <hi>Zebadiah</hi> the Ruler of the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> his chief commiſſioner for all the Kings matters; but alſo <hi>Amariah</hi> the chief Prieſt, his chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner for all the matters of the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 11.

<pb n="565" facs="tcp:114933:304"/>
the purity and the truth, but not the outward publick ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and practice of Religion; that depends very much, if not altogether, upon the external or temporal power, both for its being, and for its continuance; For if men once turn mad and outragious, (as tis very eaſie for thoſe who are out of their honeſty, to be alſo out of their wits) the fear of Gods Judgements will no more terrifie them, then the love of Gods truth will perſwade them to conſult with their conſciences; ſo that neither fear nor love of God is like to bring them to a right order in his worſhip and ſervice, nor to keep them in it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſuch a caſe as this (and a miſchief that hath already been ſo often felt, ought to be alwayes feared) unleſs the ſecular arm defend the Church, well there may be ſome private love and deſire, but there can ſcarce be any publick practice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the true Religion; This <hi>Auguſtine</hi> proves at large, <hi>Epiſt. 50.

ye that are Judges of the earth;</hi> For now that Kings are called to the knowledge of Religion, tis not rational to ſay they are not called to the defence of it; <hi>Quis mente ſobrius Regibus dicat, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite curare in regno veſtro à quo teneatur vel oppugnetur Eccleſia Domini veſtri; non ad vos pertineat in regno veſtro quis velit eſſe ſive religioſus ſive ſacrilegus, quibus dici non poteſt, non ad vos per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineat in regno veſtro, quis velit pudicus eſſe, quis impudicus: What ſober man will ſay to Kings, It is no part of your care to look after the Church of your Lord, who do poſſeſs it, or who do oppoſe it, as if they were not to look after mens piety, who are to look after womens chaſtity; as if it concerned them that there ſhould be no baſtards, &amp; not much more, that there ſhould be no ſacriledge or idolatry in their kingdoms.</hi>

The words werr ſpoken to <hi>Eli</hi> for not reſtraining the wickedneſs of his ſons; He had made a grave Sermon to them <hi>as a Prieſt,</hi> but he had not inflicted ſevere puniſhments upon them <hi>as a Judge;</hi> And becauſe he had not puniſhed them, God reſolves to puniſh him: Nay to puniſh Religion for his ſake, thinking it more agreeable with his honour that his Ark ſhould be captivated by <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> then prophaned and defiled by Iſraelites: We who have ſeen the ſame ſins, may juſtly fear we ſhall ſee the ſame confuſion; However, we muſt pray that we may no more ſee the ſame ſins, or that we may ſee them ſeverely puniſhed; That neither we may depart from our glory, nor our glory may depart from us: For ſurely there is a very great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the meer outward face and practice of Religion, and much more in the inward zeal and love of it; This made King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſo zealous to fetch the Ark of God from <hi>Kiriathjearim,</hi> as himſelf profeſſeth, 1 <hi>Chron. 13. 3. Let us bring again the Ark of our God to us, for we enquired not at it in the dayes of</hi> Saul; He had been ſo long without the publick exerciſe of Religion (becauſe of the troubles which had befallen him and the whole Nation, in the days of <hi>Saul,</hi>) that now he could not endure to be without it any longer: The outragious perſecutions of <hi>Saul</hi> had diſturbed him; The furious and frequent invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:114933:307"/>
of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> had diſturbed the people: Hence it was that Gods worſhip had been without the Ark, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been without Gods worſhip; Religion had been without its life, and they had been without Religion: Either of which alone was enough to make the troubles of their ſouls much more irkſome and intolerable, then were the troubles of their bodies; how much more both of them joyned together? And thus were they prepared by the want of ſo great bleſſings, the more perfectly to diſcry, and the more eaneſtly to deſire the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable happineſs they ſhould have in the enjoyment of them; and happily hence it was, that when God offered to <hi>David</hi> either a ſeven years famine, or a three months war, or a three dayes peſtilence, yet he rather made choice of this then of the other; though in all probability he might expect that himſelf ſhould be the firſt to periſh in the peſtilence (which was ſent for his ſake,) but the laſt that ſhould periſh either in the famine or in the war. I am willing to impute the reaſon of this choice meerly to his love of Religion; He was afraid that a ſeven years fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine might make the people for want of meat, grudge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at their ſacrifices, and ſo there would be a ceſſation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which is a probable conjecture, becauſe above three years of the famine had been already paſt, when God asked him the queſtion, ſaith <hi>Rabbi David,</hi> thereby reconciling the ſeven years in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. with the three years of famine, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 12. So that <hi>David</hi> ſeeing ſo great a decay in the ſacrifices for a famine but of three years, had reaſon to fear that if it ſhould laſt out all the ſeven years, there would be at all no ſacrifice; I ſay, he was afraid that a ſeven years famine might make the people for want of meat to put into their own bellies, grudge and repine at their ſacrifices, and ſo there would be a ceſſation of Religion; But he was ſure that in a three months war the ſouldiers would make havock both of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and of Prieſts, and ſo there would be a diſturbance, if not a total deſolation and deſtruction of Religion; Therefore he had rather venter to die firſt in the peſtilence; then laſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the famine or in the war, becauſe he feared that in either of thoſe exigencies Religion might alſo die with him; particularly he ſeemed moſt averſe from the war, as foreſeeing that he could not flee three months before

Nor doth this doctrine looſen the joints, or diſſolve the ligaments of Government; It takes not away the rights of Kingdoms or Churches, by giving to God his Right; Let humane Laws bind in the court of conſcience, but either let them not be laws if they be palpably againſt the Law of God; or let humane laws ſo bind the conſcience, as that the divine law may bind it much more: We confeſs it is neither ſafe nor ſound Divinity to extenuate the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of humane laws; but we alſo profeſs that the extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the power of Divine laws muſt needs have leſs both of ſafety and of ſoundneſs; And it is to be feared that this hath been the greateſt cauſe of the other, and that God hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the People to make ſo light of the authority of the Church, becauſe a great faction in the Church hath of late made ſo light of Gods own Authority: For what elſe have they done who have not only magiſterially tranſgreſſed, but alſo maliciouſly calumniated the Holy Scriptures, that by diſcountenancing,

So that to ſpeak the plain truth, no men have ſo much oppoſed that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of humane laws binding the conſcience, as thoſe who have made the ſlighteſt account of the divine law; as if that could not, or at leaſt had not bound their conſciences; For it is without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, &amp; therefore ſhould be without denyal, that Gods law hath a far greater power and dominion over the conſcience of the greateſt governour, then mans law can have or challenge over the conſcience of the meaneſt ſubject: Therefore the readieſt way for the Church to obtain a conſcionable obedience from the people, is to obſerve a conſcionable obedience towards God: and not by raiſing objections or rather cavils againſt the law of God, to teach the people to object againſt and cavil with her laws, when they ſhould obey them: Wherein ſome late Church-men have been very much too blame, who have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to caſt that aſperſion of obſcurity and uncertainty upon Gods hand-writing, which they would take very diſdainfully ſhould be caſt upon their own writings; thereby in effect gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gods law a <hi>quietus eſt</hi> as to the binding of the conſcience (without which yet their own laws cannot bind it) ſince it is impoſſible that the conſcience ſhould be bound either by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities or by uncertainties; For if the law be obſcure, who can act with the knowledge of his underſtanding? If it be
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:114933:309"/>
uncertain, who can act with the conſent of his will? And if conſcience be the Practical judgement, how can it act without either of theſe? for how can it be a Judgement without the knowledge of the underſtanding? how can it a practical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience without the conſent of the will?</p>
                           <p>Or to inforce this argument of natural reaſon with a <hi>medium</hi> of Religion, ſince whatſoever is not of faith is ſin, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not of the evidence, or of the aſſurance of faith, is not of faith; and what is obſcure cannot beget the evidence; what is uncertain cannot beget the aſſurance of faith; who can think that obſcure and uncertain laws can bind the conſcience, and not think that the conſcience may be bound to ſin? So little is the Church of Chriſt beholding to thoſe Divines who yet would be thought moſt of all to magnifie and to extoll her; For whiles they leſſon the authority of Gods law in binding the conſcience, they cannot but leſſon the authority of the Churches law, which can have no ſuch authority but from the law of God: Even as he that ſhould caſt any ſcornful reproach upon the light of the Sun, would in vain make a Panegyrick in praiſe of the luſtre of the Moon, ſince ſhe hath all her light and luſtre from the Sun; Therefore let them no longer tell us that Gods Law is obſcure till they have explained it, unleſs they would have us not think it a Law, till they have made it ſo; for if it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, it cannot have the virtue, nor challenge the obligation of a law; For if this great trumpet which ſummons us all to the Church militant, that we may be ſouldiers under Chriſts banner, I ſay, if this <hi>trumpet give an uncertain ſound, who ſhall prepare himſelf to the battle? So likewiſe you, except ye utter by the tongue words eaſie to be underſtood, how ſhall it be known what is ſpoken? for ye ſhall ſpeak into the air, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 8, 9. The Argument hath as much force againſt the Spirit of God as againſt the Miniſters of God, if he hath no uttered ſignificant words, hath he not ſpoken into the air? For ſhame let us leave off ſuch objections, leaſt we indeed force him to ſpeak into the air, whiles he intends and deſires to ſpeak unto our ſtony hearts: So little doth it become any Divine to ſet the Law of the Church in a competition with the law of God, much leſs in a perfection above it; as if that were plain and ſure, this were uncertain and obſcure; For mens conſciences muſt firſt
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:114933:310"/>
be directed before they can be obliged; and therefore to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Gods law to be defective in its direction, is to make it defective in its obligation; And if Gods law be imperfect, how can the Churches law be perfect, either to direct or to oblige our conſciences? <hi>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul, Pſalm</hi> 19. 7. If it were not for its own perfection, it could not produce our converſion; nor can we oppoſe the perfection of Gods law, without oppoſing the converſion of our own ſouls; Therefore we muſt above all things, be carefull to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Rule of our Religion, if we would engage mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to receive it, and much more to practiſe it; for it is impoſſible they ſhould be religious without their conſciences, and much more againſt them; He that ſearcheth the heart, may not be ſerved without the heart; and he that moſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the Heart in his ſervice, will not be ſerved againſt the the Heart; Therefore every man muſt worſhip God with the knowledge of his underſtanding, and with the conſent of his will; and conſequently we may not deny, That there is evidence of Truth in the rule of Gods worſhip to iuſtruct the underſtanding and certainty of goodneſs in it to fix and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the will, (<hi>i. e.</hi> to eſtabliſh the heart) unleſs we will have men Religious either without their conſciences for want of knowledge, or againſt their conſciences for want of conſent; For if a man doth the beſt act of Religion without his conſcience, that act is to him little leſs then brutiſh; if againſt his conſcience, tis to him leſs then damnable: and therefore we have great reaſon to abominate ſuch a Tenent, as may either ſuppoſe a man to be a Brute in his Religion, by acting without his conſcience, or ſuppoſe a man to be a Devil in his Religion, by acting againſt his conſcience.</p>

                           <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour bidding us ſeek the Kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33.) plainly ſheweth that we have no hopes of finding Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (and much leſs of enjoying it) till we have found out Gods Kingdom, and are become faithful ſubjects of the ſame; And what is Gods Kingdom but his Church, wherein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth dominion in the hearts of his faithful people, having eſtabliſhed his Throne upon theſe two pillars of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holineſs?</hi> by <hi>Truth</hi> enlightning their underſtandings, by <hi>Holineſs</hi> inflaming their wills and affections, and ſanctifying their lives and converſations; ſo that it is no hard matter to find out the Kingdom of God, and to diſtinguiſh it from all the Kingdoms of the world, ſince it is to be diſcerned by its <hi>Truth,</hi> and by its <hi>Holineſs;</hi> For it is <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> that makes a <hi>Church,</hi> though it is <hi>power</hi> and <hi>pomp</hi> that makes a <hi>ſtate;</hi> There is no coming to Gods Kingdom but by theſe, no tarrying in it but with theſe, no going from it but by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking theſe; ſo that any Chriſtian people or nation in the world may thus plead for it ſelf, Tell me not of departing from the Church of Chriſt, unleſs you can ſhew me wherein I have departed from <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which two make and conſtitute his <hi>Church;</hi> If I believe all the Articles of Faith as he hath revealed them, and practiſe all the duties of life as he hath commanded them, ſure I am, though you may deny me <hi>yours,</hi> yet my Saviour will not deny me <hi>his</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; though you may not eſteem me a member of yours, yet he will eſteem me a member of his Body.</p>
                           <p>This is all that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> requires to the conſtitution of a Chriſtian Church, when he ſaith, <hi>Rom. 10. 10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs;</hi> there's the truth moſt
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:114933:311"/>
chiefly fixed in the heart; <hi>and with the mouth confeſſion is mad unto ſalvation;</hi> there's the holineſs, moſt chiefly expreſſed by the mouth: Again, <hi>Whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed;</hi> there's the truth, received by Faith; And, <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved,</hi> there's the holineſs exerciſed by prayer; ſhall he believe, and ſhall he call upon the name of the Lord, and not belong unto the Lord here? Shall he not be aſhamed, ſhall he be ſaved, and not belong to the Lord hereafter? And what elſe is the Church but <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>That which belongeth to the Lord,</hi> here whilſt Militant, hereafter when Triumphant? And how ſhall any people that believeth and calleth upon the Lord, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from belonging to the Lord, or from being his Church, when it is ſaid ſo generally, <hi>Whoſoever believeth on him, and whoſoever ſhall call upon his name;</hi> Therefore in every Nation that believeth on Chriſt, and calleth on his name, (for they are inſeparable, the faith is not without the confeſſion, the belief is not without the prayer, the truth is not without the holineſs) Chriſt hath his Church, and that Church hath the means of ſalvation, <hi>Faith and prayer</hi> (or <hi>truth and holineſs:</hi>) and the promiſe of ſalvation, 1. Privatively, <hi>He ſhall not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:</hi> 2. Poſitively, <hi>He ſhall be ſaved:</hi> and we cannot deny it the ſalvation it ſelf without detracting from Gods mercy, which hath made good the means, and from Gods truth, which will make good the promiſe; And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving planted a particular Church in <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſaith concerning the Presbyters there: <hi>The Holy Ghoſt had made them Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of that people, Act.</hi> 20. 28. He could have ſaid no more of himſelf and of his fellow-Apoſtles who had an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry calling, but that the Holy Ghoſt had made them overſeers; and he ſaith no leſs of thoſe Miniſters who had only an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary calling; And what doth he intimate by ſaying ſo, But that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> had ſtill the ſame hopes and means of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as before, whilſt himſelf inſtructed and governed them? For that the Holy Ghoſt the Lord and giver of life, could and would give them life by his ordinary as well as by his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Miniſters: For we cannot but ſay that thoſe are words of eternal truth, as well as of eternal comfort, <hi>Pſal. 73. 1. Truly God is loving unto Iſrael, even unto ſuch as are of a
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:114933:311"/>
clean heart;</hi> for there is no doubt of Gods being loving unto Iſrael, no more then of Iſraels being of a clean heart; If they be of a clean heart, they muſt be of Gods Iſrael, though they may be of ſeveral Tribes; And if they be of Gods Iſrael, they are ſure of Gods love; He will here guide them with his counſel, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after receive them with glory; For he ſanctifieth them by his Truth, that he may ſave them by his mercy: And accordingly S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Timothy, Take heed unto thy ſelf and unto the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, continue in them; for in doing this thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf and them that hear thee, 1 Tim</hi> 4. 16. Thereby ſhewing he had left the people of <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſufficient means of being ſaved, in that he had left them an infallible doctrine, though he had not left them an infallible Doctor: For if <hi>Timothy</hi> by taking heed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, and to the Doctrine he had received, was able to ſave both himſelf and thoſe who were committed to his charge, tis evident the people of <hi>Epheſus</hi> had no more need (in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) of an infallible Biſhop to teach them, then they had of an impeccable Biſhop to govern them: and indeed infallibility can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in the underſtanding, without impeccability in the will, ſince the will doth neceſſarily follow the laſt dictate of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and it ſelf being depraved, may corrupt and deprave both the firſt and the laſt dictate of it. Nay yet more, leſt we ſhould make light account of the authority of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, becauſe we can neither prove nor believe their infallibility any more then we can their impeccability, we find plainly that S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the particular Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> (even that Church with which <hi>Timothy</hi> was entruſted, and in which he was taught by this Epiſtle how to behave himſelf) <hi>The houſe of God, the pillar and ground of the truth, 1 Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> 3. 35. Though we may juſtly, and ſhould willingly infer, that if a particular Church by cleaving to the word of Truth, deſerved to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the pillar and ground of Truth, then ſure the Univerſal Church much more; For ſo the argument will proceed <hi>à mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore ad majus.</hi> If one Miniſter ſhall be able to teach the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Truth, whilſt he ſwerves neither to the right hand nor to the left from the word of Truth, then much more a whole National Church, and moſt of all the Catholike and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, that is diffuſed over all Nations; if ſhe carefully attend, and ſtedfaſtly cleave to that ſame word of Truth;
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:114933:312"/>
And if any man think this condition unneceſſary, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that thoſe four general Councils, which Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> received as four Goſpels, did ſet the Bible upon a Throne in the midſt of their aſſembly, appealing to it for all their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and proving by it all their determinations; which if all other general Councils, at leaſt ſo reputed, had done ſince that time, well we might have had fewer Articles, but certainly we muſt have had a ſurer Creed, and a founder faith; nor can we deny but ſome provincial Councils by cleaving to the Text, have more truly ſhewed themſelves the pillars of Truth, then ſome reputed general Councils that have forſaken it; as the Council of <hi>Gangra</hi> which had in it but thirteen Biſhops, yet ſuppreſſed no leſs then twenty Schiſmatical opinions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereas the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> that conſiſted almoſt of all Nations, making light regard of Chriſts inſtitution and order concerning the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> though it ended the Schiſm of the Popes, yet it began ſuch a Schiſm in the Church as is like to continue to the worlds end; for ſurely there will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be ſome conſcionable men, who will prefer the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt in his own Sacrament, above the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Council; and who will think there can be no Schiſm either leſs curable or more damnable, then that which dares ſet up the pretended authority of the Church, againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Authority of Chriſt. This is moſt certain, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> took it for granted that the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the whole Doctrine of the Scriptures, (for in the firſt Chapter he mentions both the Law and the Goſpel,) and that ſhe alſo followed thoſe inſtructions, before he called her the houſe of God, the pillar and ground of Truth: For indeed the firſt part of every Churches Truſt is the Word of God, which ſhe is entruſted withal in a threefold reſpect; 1. That ſhe ſhould keep it. 2. That ſhe ſhould expound it. 3. That ſhe ſhould obey it. Wherefore thoſe men who of late have cavilled at the written Word, thereby thinking to reſolve all Religion into the Authority of the Church, have in truth taken a direct courſe to reſolve the Authority of the Church into nothing; For if the Church hath not been Gods faithful Truſtee, in keeping the ſubſtance or letter of his word; who can think her faithful in expounding the ſenſe, or in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:114933:312"/>
the commands of the ſame? And ſo then farewell to the Churches faithfulneſs, and conſequently to her authority, which is grounded chiefly upon her faithfulneſs; For it is as juſt an exception now, as it was in the Apoſtles times, <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto you, more then unto God, judge ye, Act.</hi> 4. 19. The intent of your arguments againſt the Scriptures, is to adviſe us not to hearken unto God, that we might only hearken unto you; But the reaſon and force of your arguments will certainly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>eep us from heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto you, becauſe they make it evident that you have not hearkned unto God; Nay you have ſet light by his Word, that you might not hearken unto him.</p>
                           <p>But this argument is good only againſt the men, not againſt the cauſe, and it is therefore beſt when it is againſt the worſt men. Thoſe who have leaſt hearkned to Gods voice, have given the greateſt cauſe to others, not to hearken unto their voices; And if they will needs be angry with us, let them conſider that God is firſt angry with them, and therefore they ought to be angry with themſelves; For they took not only a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impious, but alſo a very indiſcreet way by vilifying the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Gods word, to magnifie the authority of their own. And yet to ſpeak the plain truth, this is rather to be called a cavil then an argument; For let all the Original Bibles be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined both of the Papiſts and of the Proteſtant Churches, we ſhall find them all exactly agreeing in one Hebrew and Greek Text, and their diſagreement to be only in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral gloſſes and Tranſlations, in ſo much that all theſe parts of Chriſtendom would ſoon be of one and the ſame profeſſion, as well as they are of one and the ſame Religion, if all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches would agree in the ſenſe, as they do agree in the Letter of Gods holy Word; To let paſs the Old Teſtament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all Proteſtant Churches are as willing to be tryed by the King of <hi>Spains,</hi> as by <hi>Buxtorſes</hi> Hebrew Bibles, I know <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaes</hi> Greek Teſtament is cenſured by ſome, as a moſt bold piece of Scripture; but upon comparing his Text with that of Pope <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> I find very little ground for that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and leſs Truth in it; Becauſe both Texts gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agree in the very ſame words, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that even in thoſe very places, wherein both diſagree from the Vulgar Latine:
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:114933:313"/>
And I believe the ſame may be ſaid concerning the Greek Text that is received in all other Churches. That they all agree in the ſame Original Texts, evinceth they have been faithful in their Truſt of keeping the Holy Scriptures; That many of them diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in their gloſſes upon, and tranſlations of that Text, only ſheweth that each particular Church is willing to diſcharge its own particular Truſt in expounding the Holy Scriptures; That they all labour not to continue, and increaſe their diſagreement, but to end or to diminiſh it, (for ſo the Churches do, though the men do not) is alſo a good ſign that no one of them is willing to be faulty in their Truſt of obſerving and obeying the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: And therefore though it muſt be confeſſed that the Church like Queen <hi>Vaſthi,</hi> hath not performed the commandment of her King ſo readily and ſo entirely as ſhe ought, yet may not any ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid <hi>Memucan</hi> ſuppoſe that there ſhall ever go forth a royal commandment that ſhe come no more before the King <hi>Ahaſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> for though ſhe may unhappily have been peccant in her obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſhe hath not been peccant in her faith; though ſhe may have failed in her behaviour, ſhe hath not failed in her Truſt; though ſhe hath been undutiful, yet ſhe hath not been falſe; ſhe hath not been unfaithful to her King, that he ſhould ſeek a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, and give her royall eſtate unto another that is better then ſhe; Let no man think that our bleſſed Saviour, the Prince of peace, the King of Saints, will ſo eaſily part with his Spouſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom he hath ſaid, <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in loving kindneſs, and in mercies; I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth thee unto me in faithfulneſs, and thou ſhalt know the Lord, Hoſ.</hi> 2. 19, 20. And ſince Chriſt will not ſo eaſily be parted from his Church, how is it that we do ſo eaſily part and depart from her? If we did rightly diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Men,</hi> we would ſoon all bleſs God for the Truth and Faith of his Church, though we ſhould blame one another for our own falſeneſs and unfaithfulneſs; we would find that the <hi>Church</hi> hath been true to her truſt, in keeping, in expounding, in obeying Gods word, and that only the <hi>Men</hi> have been faulty: Thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> blamed the <hi>Men,</hi> not the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> for their factions and ſchiſms: <hi>It hath been declared to me of you my brethren, that there are

Will you reject the Treaſure becauſe of the Veſſel? you were as good to ſay, you would have the excellency of the power in converting and ſaving ſouls to be of men, not of God: The Veſſel is certainly brittle, and may poſſibly be foul; but the treaſure is neither brittle nor foul; thats a laſting trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for Truth is ſo; thats a pure Treaſure, for holineſs is ſo; As a Treaſure it will enrich your ſoul, as a pure Treaſure it will purge your ſoul, as a pure and laſting Treaſure it will purge and enrich your ſoul, not for a moment, but for ever: Tis confeſſed that this Treaſure was at firſt in much better Veſſels then now it is, when neither perverſneſs ſought to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticate the truth, nor prophaneneſs to corrupt the holineſs of the Chriſtian Religion; but the Treaſure it ſelf is ſtill the ſame it firſt was, <hi>For Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever, Heb.</hi> 13. 8. The wickedneſs of man hath not deſtroyed, cannot deſtroy the goodneſs of God; He hath ſtill his communion of Saints, amongſt theſe great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of ſinners; he hath ſtill one Catholick and Apoſtolical Church, amongſt our many divided and diſtracted Churches: And bleſſed be his name, he firſt provided againſt our diviſions and diſtractions, before he ſuffered us to make them: For it was from his ſingular providence, that the <hi>Romans</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſhould keep entire their dominion over all the Chriſtian world, till they had called thoſe general Councils, wherein was the confutation of the grand hereſies, and the eſtabliſhment of the true Chriſtian Faith, in the firſt ages of the Church, whilſt the greateſt part of the Miniſtry in all Churches rightly underſtood, and zealouſly maintained the Faith of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; For elſe it is much to be feared that theſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages

of Chriſtians (which have been ſo much wedded to State Policy, and ſo reſolved on ſelf-intereſt) would have been much to ſeek for the truly antient Catholick and Apoſtolick Faith, now briefly ſummed up in thoſe Creeds, which as they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable proofs of the Apoſtles aſſertion, that <hi>the Church is the ground and pillar of truth,</hi> ſo they are alſo the infallible guides of particular Churches to retain and follow that Truth to the worlds end: Wherefore God having left us his own undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed word, and ſuch incomparable ſumms of the ſaving Truths therein contained, as is the Apoſtles Creed, and thoſe other antient Creeds of the Church, there is now no particular Church in the world, which hath theſe helps, and will carefully and conſcionably make uſe of them, but may be ſure of believing the Catholick Faith; and conſequently of profeſſing the true Chriſtian Religion whereby to know Chriſt, and of perſiſting in the true Chriſtian Communion, whereby to enjoy him; though perchance the factions of men may be ſo great, and the Judgement of God, becauſe of thoſe factions, may be ſo juſt, as never again to let the Church enjoy the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a true general Council: And without doubt every particular Church which profeſſeth the Chriſtian Faith accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures and thoſe Creeds, and hath a practice agreeable to her profeſſion, may juſtly be called the <hi>ground and pillar of truth,</hi> and may not juſtly be condemned by another Church, much leſs oppoſed or deſerted by her own ſtate; For that ſuch a Church is without doubt Gods Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtee, and hath not been faulty in the diſcharge of her Truſt, and may not be hindred or moleſted, in diſchaging it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <p>TIS no hard matter to prove That particular Churches are Gods immediate Truſtees, though they have but a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Truſt; For elſe will follow the greateſt abſurdity that can be imagined, and much greater that may be granted, <hi>viz.</hi> That God hath left the blood of his Son, the dictates of his Spirit, the honour of his name expoſed to all the contempts, and prophanations, and corruptions of perverſe, and ignorant, and wicked men, if he hath not entruſted them all with ſome ſuch perſons who are bound to ſee them neither prophaned, nor contemned nor corrupted; And who were thoſe his Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees at firſt but only his Apoſtles? and who have they been ever ſince but their Succeſſors, Biſhops and Miniſters? <hi>Take heed unto the flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers,</hi> Acts 20. 28. <hi>O Timothy, keep that which is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thy Truſt, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 20. The Miniſter, whether Biſhop or Prieſt, is immediately intruſted with the care of ſouls, and with thoſe truths and adminiſtrations which directly concern the ſoul; For the civil Magiſtrate, though he be Chriſtian, yet is not capable of diſcharging the ſpiritual part of this Truſt, being <hi>not called of God as was Aaron,</hi> to do the office of a Prieſt, though he be called of God as was <hi>Moſes,</hi> to have power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over Prieſts: For in that he is governour of the State, he is alſo governour of the Church, which is in and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the State; and in that he is governour of the Church, he muſt needs have his ſhare in the Truſt of the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion, as far as Religion is liable to the government of the State, <hi>ſc.</hi> to be ordered, protected and defended by it;

What Church? but that wherein thy brother liveth with thee, not another Church wherein he liveth not; for then our Saviour would certainly have named that other Church; which ſince he hath not done, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this injured mans own Church, or elſe leave the peace of Chriſtians under very great difficulties, and greater uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties: to this proof taken out of the firſt, let us add another out of the laſt book of the new Teſtament. Our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſends to the ſeven Churches which are in <hi>Aſia, Rev.</hi> 1. 11 and blames the Angels of them all ſeverally for the ſeveral miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors which he had ſeen in them, which plainly ſhews that thoſe ſeveral Angels had their ſeveral Truſts; and as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves that the doctrine concerning the Truſt of particular Churches, doth in no wiſe canton or diſmember or diſunite the Catholick Church; for it is of Chriſts own teaching who is the head, and may not be thought to canton or diſmember or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite his own body. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe ſent ſeven ſeveral Epiſtles to ſeven ſeveral particular Chriſtian Churches, as to the Church of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Epheſus, Philippi, Coloſſe,</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> allowing and confirming the particular au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Truſt of thoſe ſeveral particular Churches, and yet by no means dividing or disjointing the Catholick Church; Whence we may juſtly infer, that what Truſt God at firſt gave to the particular Church of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Galatia</hi> and the reſt, the ſame he ſtill giveth to other particular Churches; and yet without the leaſt diviſion or diſunion of this Catholick Church; They were all ſeveral particular Churches, in regard of their truſt and jurisdiction; they were all but one Catholick Church in regard of their Faith &amp; communion; neither of them was oppoſed againſt the other, in that they were accounted as ſo

Were you the firſt founders of the Chriſtian Religion, or are you the only Partakers of it? was all Religion from you, or is there no Religion but with you? unleſs you can make good either one or both of theſe, you may not take upon you to be the only Maſters in Gods <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but muſt allow others alſo to be taught of God, to have their Religion from him, and to have their Communion with him; and what is that elſe but to be a true Chriſtian Church? to be called out of the world to Chriſt the Son of God by Religion, to abide and dwell with him by communion; Thus doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> briefly but pithily define a Chriſtian Church, 1 <hi>Theſ. 1. 1. To the Church of the Theſſalonians, which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt;</hi> We cannot imagine the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were in God, before they were with God; ſo that the one preſuppoſeth the other, and we may hence collect this definition of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, that it is a company of men, Miniſters and People (though here Saint <hi>Paul</hi> chiefly write to the Miniſters, calling them the Church, as appears in that he chargeth them to read this Epiſtle to all the Holy brethren, <hi>cap. 5. v.</hi> 27. which ſheweth that he ſent it only to the Miniſters) I ſay, that a true Chriſtian Church is a company of Men, Miniſters and People, who are
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:114933:317"/>
with the God the Father and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by their Religion, nay more, who are in God the Father and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by their communion; And all the men in the world who are thus with and in God the Father, and God the Son by the power of God the Holy Ghoſt, do make up the whole preſent Chriſtian or Catholick Church: They may be ſeveral Churches in their Denominations and Jurisdictions, They are but one Church in their Religion, and in their ſpiritual communion: Thus faith the ſame Saint <hi>Paul, Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 27. that is, ye Chriſtians of all Nations are the myſtical body of Chriſt, aud ye Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of this or that Nation, are members in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of that body, and members in particular one of another, as all together make up that body, or as all particular Churches make up the Catholick Church.</p>

And this is the caſe of Miniſters above all other men, who have received ſuch a Truſt from God as all the power of the world could not give them, and all the malice of the world cannot deny them. Indeed it is the caſe of every particular Miniſter, much more of the whole Miniſtry, or of a whole Church, which is more eminently Gods Truſtee, and hath a much greater Truſt, then either the arrogancy of any one can challenge, or the ability of any one can diſcharge; And therefore if the ſpirit of God

give that charge to one particular <hi>Archippus, Take heed to the Miniſtery which thou haſt received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it, Col.</hi> 4. 17. much more doth it give the ſame charge to the whole Church of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> which had in a more ample manner and for a more general end received the ſame Miniſtery: And though the Church of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> it ſelf was ſoon after ſwallowed up with an Earth-quake, (in the dayes of <hi>Nero</hi> as ſaith <hi>Oroſius</hi>) yet not ſo the Inſtructions nor the authority given to it, they muſt remain till the worlds end; <hi>Take heed to the Miniſtery which thou haſt received in the Lord,</hi> is not to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the cleaving and dividing of the earth, no more then it is to be revoked or recalled by any voice from heaven; And ſo was it alſo with the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as appears from Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> charge to the firſt Biſhop of that Church, <hi>I give thee charge in the ſight of God, and before Chriſt Jeſus, that thou keep this commandment without ſpot, unrebukeable untill the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Tim.</hi> 6 13, 14. In that he chargeth him to keep the commandments he had received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion, without ſpot, unrebukeable, he ſheweth the Churches truſt; in that he addeth to his charge <hi>untill the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he ſheweth that Truſt is to continue till the worlds end: For in this caſe we muſt alwayes remember thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Mar. 13. 37. And what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all,</hi> (Watch:) For what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he ſaid to all Biſhops that ever ſhould be after him, as well as to all that were then with him; For the Apoſtolical Epiſtles though in their inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Title they concerned ſome ſpecial Churches, yet in their Inſtructions and uſe they concerned all Churches, as plainly appears from Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> own words, <hi>Col. 4. 16. And when this Epiſtle is read amongſt you, cauſe that it be read alſo in the Church of the</hi> Laodiceans; <hi>and that yee likewiſe read the Epiſtle from</hi> Laodicea; So that what Inſtruction or Authority or charge was given to one Church, was given to all Churches in that one; And conſequently we may thus argue by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; The Truſt of Religion was given by God to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> and of <hi>Theſſalonica;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame truſt is given by God to our own Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

and indeed to all the ſeveral particular Churches in the Chriſtian world; For if each particular Biſhop and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter have his Truſt originally from the Holy-Ghoſt, though derived by the hands of men; Then much more have all the Biſhops and Presbyters their Truſt from the Holy Ghoſt; Hence that expreſſion in the firſt Council of Biſhops, <hi>Act. 15. 28.

Ye ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed in heart and ears, ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> For whoſoever is ſtiff-necked and will not hear nor obey the word of truth, though in the mouth of a weak and ſinful man ſent from God to ſpeak it, doth make himſelf guilty of this deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and damnable reſiſtance, even of reſiſting the Holy Ghoſt: For thoſe Presbyters of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were as much ordained and appointed by men, as any can be of any Church till the worlds ends (ſuppoſing they be rightly ordained) to whom yet the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Take heed unto all the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, Act.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
                           <p>For the ordination of Miniſters, though it is <hi>by man,</hi> yet is it not <hi>of men,</hi> but of God, even as alſo is the Goſpel which they are ordained to preach; ſo that to reſiſt them and their Doctrine, is not to reſiſt men, but God; ſo ſaid he who firſt ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, and ſtill aſſiſteth them in their miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth

you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me, Luk.</hi> 10. 16. How ſhall any man go on this errand without Gods ſending, when the eternal word himſelf would not preach till he was ſent? How ſhall any man deſpiſe thoſe whom the Word hath ſent, and not deſpiſe the Word that ſent them, and the Father that ſent the Word? And how ſhall any man deſpiſe the Father and the Son, and not grieve the Holy Spirit who proceedeth from them? So impoſſible is it for any to deſpiſe the Church which God hath ſet over him, and not ſin againſt God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt: For the argument is <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> if it be dangerous to deſpiſe one, much more to deſpiſe all: if to undervalue a Diſciple, much more an Apoſtle: For as the Apoſtles had a greater truſt then the 70. Diſciples; ſo hath every National Church, (which is as it were the grand Apoſtle of its Nation,) a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter truſt then any particular Biſhop or Presbyter of the ſame; and the Church now hath that truſt, as the Apoſtles firſt had it <hi>from God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, (but doubtleſs he ſaith it for more then himſelf,) that he was an <hi>Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt by the commandment of God,</hi> that is of God the Father, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 1. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith of him, that twas God the Son, even Jeſus our bleſſed Saviour, who called him to be an Apoſtle, who ſaid unto him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> and who ſaid of him, <hi>He is a choſen veſſel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the Children of Iſrael, Acts</hi> 9. 4, 15. The ſame Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith in another place, that he was called to the Function of the Apoſtleſhip by the commandment of God the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act. 13. 2. The Holy Ghoſt ſaid, Separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>for the work whereto I have called them;</hi> Which variety of expreſſion doth not only verifie that common axiome of Divinity, <hi>Opera Trinitatis ad extra ſunt indiviſa, The works of the bleſſed Trinity in regard of any external product are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,</hi> ſo that what is externally done by one perſon is done by all; But it doth alſo teſtifie the great truſt which was laid upon every one of the Apoſtles, in that he received his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: And as this truſt hath ſince been, and ſtill is derived to the Church, ſo it hath been and is derived by the ſame glorious and bleſſed
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:114933:319"/>
Trinity; Whereby we ſee the large Expoſition that is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thoſe words, <hi>he that heareth you, heareth me, (Luk.</hi> 10. 16.) for it is all one as if it had been ſaid, he heareth God, he heareth the Son of God, he heareth the Spirit of God; Wherefore ſuppoſing that this national Church wherein we live, is as Gods Apoſtle to this Nation, no ſectary can juſtly pretend to God or Chriſt, no <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> can juſtly pretend to the Spirit of God and Chriſt, why he ſhould not hearken to the dictates, and follow the directions of this Church, which God, and Chriſt, and the Spirit of God and Chriſt hath ſet over him.</p>
                           <p>I find in the antient Calenders on the twenty ſixth of <hi>May,</hi> this Title, <hi>Auguſtini Anglorum Apoſtoli; The feaſt of Saint</hi> Auguſtine <hi>the Apoſtle of the Engliſh;</hi> He was looked upon as one that had planted the Chriſtian Faith amongſt us; and was therefore in the judgement of the Latine Church, eſteemed and called our Apoſtle.</p>
                           <p>I will not diſpute the ground, but only admit the Title, for if one ſingle Prieſt or Biſhop was not unfitly called the Apoſtle of our Nation; Then much more may a whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Biſhops and Presbyters be ſo called, and ought to be ſo eſteemed, who have more generally propagated, more firmly eſtabliſhed, and more carefully preſerved amongſt us the true Chriſtian Faith; It is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> own argument to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, If I be not an Apoſtle unto others, yet doubtleſs I am to you, for the ſeal of mine Apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord, 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 2. As if he had ſaid, no Embaſſadour can more juſtifie his truſt and his authority by his Princes ſeal annexed to his Credential letters, then I can juſtifie my Apoſtleſhip towards you, in that by my preaching you have been converted to the Lord, and are confirmed in him; what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in bringing them to the knowledge and to the communion of Chriſt, (to the knowledge of Chriſt by preaching the word, to the communion of Chriſt by adminiſtring the Sacraments) that our Church hath been and ſtill is to us: And therefore what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Crinthians,</hi> that our Church may juſtly ſay to us, (<hi>Since theſe things were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 11.) <hi>If I be not an Apoſtle unto others, yet doubtleſs I am to you; For the ſeal of mine Apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord;</hi> Though others may
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:114933:320"/>
pretend they have ſome cauſe to doubt the truſt and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Church, as if ſhe had not a true ſucceſſion of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters (which in truth is but a meer pretence, or rather a cavil, as the learned <hi>Maſon</hi> hath ſufficiently demonſtrated, and ſhould be leaſt objected by them who will have the whole Church depend upon the Pope, and cannot deny that they have had many, and long lived Anti-popes to diſturb their ſucceſſion) yet ſure we our ſelves can neither have cauſe nor pretence to doubt it, ſince we cannot reaſonably deny but our Church hath a true ſucceſſion of Doctrine: ſo that for us, who have not only the ſpeculative, but alſo the practical, the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental knowledge of the Goſpel, unleſs we have been groſly wanting to our ſelves, and impiouſly wanting to our Saviour; for us I ſay to doubt of our Church, is little other then to doubt of our Religion, as if that either had not come from Chriſt, or could not bring us to Chriſt, and keep us with him: For there can be no doubt of the Embaſſadours authority, if there be no doubt of his Princes ſeal; and if we our ſelves be not the ſeal of our Churches Apoſtleſhip in the Lord, the fault is meerly our own, tis becauſe we would not admit the ſtamp and impreſſion of Chriſt upon our ſtony hearts; tis becauſe we have been as Iron, when we ſhould have been as wax, and not having received, nor deſirous to receive the ſeal of our Lord, do queſtion the authority of his Embaſſadour, of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; not having in us the image of Chriſt, do contemn the authority, and forſake the communion of his Church; For as the want of natural affection diſcovered the harlot not to have been the true mother of the child, 1 <hi>King</hi> 3. 26. So the want of filial obedience diſcovereth us not to have been true children, but by no means our Church, to have been a falſe mother. There is great reaſon and greater neceſſity why all true ſons of this diſtreſſed and deſpiſed Church ſhould (now eſpecially) inſiſt upon this Doctrine, ſince at this time the contumacy of the children, hath made diſputable (nay almoſt deſperate) the authority of the Mother: Wherein as we have S. <hi>Pauls</hi> example to invite us, ſo we have his authority to juſtifie us; for queſtionleſs he did therefore ſo much magnifie his own Apoſtleſhip, that we ſhould learn to magnifie it much more.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>And truly this is but a reaſonable poſition both in regard of thoſe in authority, who do only maintain their own, (unleſs we will deny that to be their own, which God hath ſo manifeſtly given them) and in regard of thoſe under authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who cannot be willing to obey, what they are not deſirous to maintain; and yet muſt either obey or be guilty of hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous impiety, ſuch as now joyns them in communion with the Devil by their ſin; <hi>for rebellion is as the ſin of witchcraft, 1 Sam.</hi> 15. 23.

                           <p>Again, there may be yet further alledged theſe reaſons why we ſhould zealouſly maintain, and carefully obey the power and authority of our own particular Church.</p>
                           <p>1. Becauſe reverence and ſuſpition cannot conſiſt together, and therefore I may not lightly ſuſpect thoſe whom I am bound to reverence, ſuch as are my ſpiritual Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; whom for this reaſon I may not lightly ſuſpect in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their integrity, much leſs of their authority.</p>

in point of fact, that private men will not eaſily know with whom they are bound to keep their Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the publick worſhip and ſervice of God, which yet is an undeniable, and ſhould be an undoubted duty of the Text.</p>
                           <p>3. Becauſe elſe there muſt be <hi>perplexitas juris,</hi> a perplexity in point of Law, which is ſuch a perplexity as God will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and man may not endure; for then the conſcience can never be at quiet, when it muſt ſo keep one Law, as to break another; And that perplexity cannot be avoided, if we allow two ſeveral Churches to have power from God to order and command the duties of our Religion; for then they may lay upon us at the ſame time quite contrary commands; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently whilſt we are obeying the one, we muſt be diſobeying the other; But it is paſt all diſpute that our own Church hath power from God over us in matters of Religion, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, Heb.</hi> 13. 17. Which cannot be underſtood of thoſe who are at a diſtance from us in another Country, becauſe it follows, <hi>For they watch for your ſouls as they that muſt give an account.</hi> But tis againſt reaſon to ſay or think that Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Italy</hi> ſhall give an account for ſouls in <hi>England;</hi> and as much againſt reaſon to ſay or think that ſouls in <hi>England</hi> ſhall not give an account for their diſobedience.</p>
                           <p>And as this Poſition, (concerning the Authority of our own particular Church) is reaſonable, ſo is it alſo religious: For this is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> own argument to the <hi>Corinthians, Though you have ten thouſand inſtructers in Chriſt, yet have ye not many Fathers; for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel; Wherefore I beſeech you be ye followers of me, 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 15, 16. Whence we cannot but collect this dogmatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, That this Church which hath begotten us in Chriſt, claimeth our obedience in Chriſt, and to renounce that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is in effect to renounce our being made Chriſtians; And as no other Church can truly ſay to us, <hi>I have begotten you through the Goſpel,</hi> ſo no other Church can juſtly ſay unto us, <hi>Wherefore I beſeech you be ye followers of me.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To ſum up all in one word; This Doctrine concerning the acknowledging and obeying the authority of mine own Church, being both rational and religious, I dare not wilfully oppoſe

                           <p>CHriſtian Religion teacheth us to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> God as is agreeable to his Glory, and profitable for our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; So that the Churches truſt concerning the Chriſtian Religion is reducible to theſe two heads, the <hi>knowledge,</hi> and the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God; And becauſe the Church is truſted with the knowledge of God, ſhe is truſted with <hi>preaching</hi> which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that knowledge; And becauſe ſhe is truſted with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, ſhe is truſted with <hi>praying,</hi> and with <hi>adminiſtring</hi>

the holy Sacraments, which conſtitute that worſhip: So that we may ſee how incongruouſly ſome men do ſeek to turn all the worſhip of God into <hi>preaching,</hi> when as in truth, that more properly belongs to the <hi>knowledge</hi> then to the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God; and though knowledge may direct our worſhip, yet it cannot conſtitute it. Wherefore God himſelf ſpeaking of his publick worſhip as it was exerciſed among the Jews on their Sabbath, calleth the Temple, wherein it was exerciſed, the <hi>houſe of Prayer, I will make them joyful in my houſe of Prayer, Iſa.</hi> 56. 7. And our bleſſed Saviour ſpeaking of the ſame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as it ſhould be exerciſed among Chriſtians, calleth the place of its exerciſe the <hi>Houſe of prayer, My houſe ſhall be called of all Nations the houſe of prayer, Mark</hi> 11. 17. In that he ſaith, <hi>of all Nations,</hi> he includeth the Chriſtians who were ſo to be, whereas the Jewiſh worſhippers were but only of one Nation; and in that he alloweth the Chriſtians to have amongſt them <hi>Gods houſe,</hi> as well as the Jews, tis evident, he calleth not only the Temple at <hi>Hieruſalem Gods houſe,</hi> but alſo all other Temples or Churches which ſhould ever after be ſet apart for Gods worſhip; &amp; plainly ſheweth that his zeal was not ſo much for that houſe, whereof in few years after not one ſtone was to be left upon another, as for thoſe houſes which were to continue to the worlds end: And laſtly in that he calleth the Temple, though ſet apart for all the acts of Gods worſhip, <hi>The houſe of prayer</hi> (&amp; that whilſt ſacrifices were not yet aboliſhed) tis evident he would have prayer looked upon, as the chiefeſt act of Gods worſhip, &amp; as chiefly belonging to Gods houſe; and that therefore no act of Religion ſhould caſt prayer out of Gods houſe, which is the houſe of prayer; as no act of irreligion ſhould caſt Gods houſe out of any Nation which is the houſe of prayer for <hi>All Nations:</hi> Preaching was ordained <hi>for</hi> Praying, not <hi>againſt</hi> it; to teach us how to make our ſupplications to God, not to exclude our making them: Which truth is either ſo palpable as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all mens conſent, or ſo powerful as to <hi>extort</hi> it: for even they who are moſt zealous for preaching, do not think fit to preach without praying, nay they commonly turn their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons into prayers, as if the one without the other, were either an <hi>ineffectual</hi> or an <hi>incompleat</hi> act of Religion, (whereas prayer <hi>alone</hi> is neither thought ineffectual nor incompleat,) thereby

giving that pre-eminence to prayer in the <hi>truth</hi> of their <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which they arrogate to preaching, in the <hi>perverſneſs</hi> of their <hi>practice,</hi> that is, <hi>To be the chiefeſt act of Religious worſhip.</hi>

Thirdly, by way of <hi>invocation;</hi> as, <hi>In thee O Lord have I put my truſt, let me never be put to confuſion, Pſalm</hi> 71. 1.

                           <p>GOD firſt inſtructed men in his own perſon till their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made them unworthy of ſo good company, then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himſelf to heaven, he inſtructed them by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> becauſe though their ſin had made them deſtitute of his good <hi>company,</hi> yet his mercy would no let them be deſtitute of his good <hi>inſtruction:</hi> Thus was God pleaſed to preach unto thoſe under the Law by <hi>himſelf</hi> and by his <hi>Prophets;</hi> And after the ſame manner was he alſo pleaſed to preach to us under the Goſpel, by his <hi>Son</hi> and by his <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> So that all Preaching hath in Truth its beginning from <hi>God,</hi> ſhould have its continuance <hi>with him,</hi> its end <hi>in him.</hi>

Apoſtles, that they alſo may <hi>begin, continue</hi> and <hi>end</hi> in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſeems to have pointed at this diſtinction of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if not to have made this diſtinction of Preachers, when he ſaith, <hi>For to one is given by the ſpirit, the word of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to another the word of knowledge by the ſame ſpirit, (1 Cor. 12. 8.) The word of wiſdom,</hi> of infallible incontroulable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being put in their mouths, who preached by Inſpiration, That is, the Prophets and Apoſtles; <hi>The word of knowledge</hi> being put in their mouths who preached by ſtudy and induſtry, that is, the ordinary Miniſters; And no more then this ſeems to be meant by the ſame Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> though much more is ſpoken, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 6. Except I ſhall ſpeak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by Prophecying, or by Doctrine,</hi> All theſe four kinds of <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> are reducible to the former two <hi>words;</hi> For ſpeaking by revelation and by prophecying belong to the word of <hi>Wiſdom:</hi> ſpeaking by knowledge and by doctrine belong to the word of <hi>knowledge;</hi> However, this is certainly an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable truth, that the Church is ſtill bound to preach both by the <hi>word of wiſdom,</hi> &amp; by the <hi>word of knowledge,</hi> and is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly bound to <hi>Tranſlate and Read the Scriptures,</hi> that ſhe may preach by the <hi>word of wiſdom;</hi> and to <hi>expound</hi> the Scriptures, that ſhe may preach by the <hi>word of knowledge;</hi> this was the twofold manner of Preaching uſed in the Primitive Church. Firſt by reading the written word of God, then by expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: So <hi>Juſtine Martyr</hi> aſſureth us in his ſecond Apology, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

(James</hi> 1. 22.) And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Preaching by Reading, and conſequently by Tranſlating the Scriptures, is ſufficiently <hi>commended</hi> in that ſaying, <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, let them hear them,</hi> but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now hear them in the tongues wherein they ſpake; we muſt therefore hear them in our <hi>own tongues;</hi> And it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

                              <hi>commended</hi> in that ſaying, <hi>If they hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded, though one roſe from the dead, (Luke</hi> 16. 29, 31.) Whereby it is evident that the Holy Scriptures Preach much more <hi>powerfully</hi> and <hi>efficaciouſly</hi> for the converſion of ſinners, then any <hi>Preacher</hi> that could come from the <hi>dead,</hi> and therefore ſurely no <hi>Preacher</hi> among the <hi>living</hi> can come neer them in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and efficacity of Preaching: This is the reaſon that the Apoſtle ſo ſolemnly chargeth, or rather adjureth the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians to read his Epiſtle to all the holy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, (1 Theſ.</hi> 5. 27.) not doubting but that his one <hi>Epiſtle</hi> alone would work more good upon the peoples ſouls, then all their <hi>Sermons;</hi> And ſince the ſame adjuration concerneth all other Churches, tis clear they are thereby obliged to tranſlate that Epiſtle into their vulgar Tongue; for elſe it would be in vain for them to read it to the People; which Truth is not only <hi>eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> and <hi>evinced,</hi> but alſo <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> and <hi>enforced</hi> at large by the ſame Apoſtle concerning the whole body of the Scriptures in the 14. of the firſt to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> in that he forbiddeth an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue to be uſed in the Church for theſe 5. ſeveral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, 1. Becauſe it is an enemy to edification and ſpeaks into the air, <hi>v.</hi> 9. 2. Becauſe it induceth Barbariſm in the very publick exerciſe of Chriſtianity, making the Prieſt little other then a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian to the People, <hi>v.</hi> 11. 3. Becauſe it hindereth Chriſtian communion; For none of the unlearned can ſo much as ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to any of the Prieſts Prayers or Thankſgivings, <hi>v.</hi> 16. 4. Becauſe it reproacheth them (among themſelves) as if they were not yet in the true faith; <hi>for tongues are for a ſign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not, v.</hi> 22. 5. Becauſe it reproacheth them among ſtrangers, as if they were not in their right wits <hi>will they not ſay that ye are mad? v.</hi> 23. All theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons either now forbid the reading of the Scriptures in our Churches (which yet the Holy Ghoſt himſelf gave us for a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,) becauſe they are in tongues unknown to us, or they require and enjoyn the Tranſlating of them into ſuch tongues as may be underſtood by the People; Therefore it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable that the Church is bound to preach <hi>by tranſlating the holy Scriptures,</hi> and may not refuſe ſo to do, unleſs ſhe will be like that unprofitable ſervant, who after he had received his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              <pb n="608" facs="tcp:114933:326"/>
went and digged in the earth, and hid his Lords money, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 18. And it were to be wiſhed, That thoſe Churches who do ſo, would ſeriouſly conſider the unprofitable ſervants Doom, which was twofold: Firſt that his Talent was taken from him, Secondly that he was caſt into outer darkneſs; For this his <hi>doom</hi> may not unfitly be thought their <hi>danger,</hi> ſince they do highly provoke God to <hi>take</hi> that precious Talent from them, which they maliciouſly <hi>keep</hi> from others, and to bring that <hi>inner darkneſs</hi> upon their own ſouls, which they now ſeek to bring upon the ſouls of the <hi>common</hi> People.</p>
                           <p>Secondly preaching by expounding the Scriptures is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>commanded,</hi> in that it is the affirmative Precept of the third Commandment, which will have us glorifie the name of God in our <hi>words;</hi> even as the Second will have us glorifie him in our <hi>Bodies,</hi> and the Fourth will have us glorifie him in our <hi>works;</hi> So that of all men in the world, thoſe Preachers who do leaſt aim at glorifying God in their Sermons, do moſt take the name of God in vain, unleſs it be ſuch as not only <hi>Preach,</hi> but alſo <hi>Pray</hi> amiſs: for they indeed are guilty of a double blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſince <hi>Praying</hi> (as to the outward words) is little other then a moſt Holy, a moſt <hi>ſanctified Preaching.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ſame Preaching by expounding the Scriptures is likewiſe ſufficiently <hi>commended;</hi> Firſt in that Chriſt himſelf the eternal word, was pleaſed to turn Preacher, and yet to ſtay till he was full 30. years old before he would take upon him the burden of <hi>Preaching,</hi> which is the reaſon the Fathers give in the Council of <hi>Noecaeſarea, Can.</hi> 11. why none ſhould be admitted to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Prieſthood before that age, though he were otherwiſe of never ſo great deſert, (<gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>) becauſe <hi>Chriſt himſelf tarried till that Age before he began to preach;</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the Apoſtles, though they committed other works of their function to other diſciples, yet reſerved to themſelves this great work of preaching, <hi>Acts 6. 4. But we will give our ſelves continually to prayer, and to the Miniſtry of the word.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>What can be ſaid more for the neceſſity of Preaching either by <hi>tranſlating</hi> or by <hi>expounding</hi> the Scriptures, then that it is moſt ſtrictly <hi>commanded</hi> by the word of God: what can be ſaid more for the excellency of it, Then that it is moſt highly <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended</hi> by the Son of God? I ſhall only crave leave to add that
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:114933:326"/>
our own Church rightly judged of this neceſſity and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and as rightly conformed her practice to her Judgement in taking ſo great care that we ſhould have an exact <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of the Holy Scriptures, and many eminent <hi>Expoſitions</hi> of the ſame; ſo that no People in the world have greater means of knowing God then we have, which is the firſt work of the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>to teach us to know God;</hi> All our fault is, we have not Affections and Actions anſwerable to our knowledge, which is the ſecond work of Chriſtian Religion, <hi>to teach us to love and honour God;</hi> and if our Church hath as faithfully diſcharged her Truſt in this as in the other, we ſhall have great reaſon to <hi>bleſs God,</hi> and not the leaſt reaſon to <hi>diſlike</hi> our <hi>Church;</hi> For what can ſhe teach us more, then Chriſt and the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath taught her, which is, <hi>to know and to worſhip God?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If our Church hath thus been our <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> to bring us unto <hi>Piety,</hi> then much more ought ſhe to be our <hi>Mother,</hi> to keep us in our <hi>Duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> So ſhall we not be ungodly without being <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor undutifull without being <hi>Monſters</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and much leſs ſhall we eaſily ſuffer our Undutifulneſs to be the cauſe of our Ungodlineſs; for we cannot be Undutifull in kicking and ſpurning againſt the true <hi>Chriſtian communion</hi> wherein we are taught to know and worſhip God, but we muſt alſo be ungodly in kicking and ſpurning againſt the true <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion,</hi> which conſiſteth in that knowledge and worſhip, though much more in the worſhip then in the knowledge; and accordingly we hope it will appear that our own Church which hath been ſo carefull to teach us to <hi>know</hi> God, hath been much more carefull to teach us to <hi>worſhip</hi> him; for as in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of him ſtandeth our eternal life, ſo in the <hi>worſhip</hi> of him is indeed the very inchoation and anticipation of eternity.</p>

                           <p>THE Church teacheth us to <hi>know</hi> God by <hi>Preaching,</hi> but ſhe teacheth us to <hi>worſhip</hi> God, by <hi>praying;</hi> And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we cannot but think <hi>praying</hi> a much greater part of her Truſt, then <hi>preaching,</hi> becauſe though it be a very great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs truly to <hi>know</hi> God, yet is it a much greater happineſs truly to <hi>worſhip</hi> him: And if the Church be bound to take care that there be no falſe <hi>doctrine</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> much more there be no abſurd <hi>prayers</hi> at the <hi>Deſque;</hi> For the Sermons men naturally <hi>hear</hi> as <hi>Judges,</hi> letting their <hi>diſcretion</hi> go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their <hi>Affection;</hi> But prayers men naturally hear as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants,</hi> letting their <hi>affection</hi> go before their <hi>diſcretion;</hi> ſo that falſe worſhip in <hi>praying</hi> is much more dangerous, and may be much more miſchievous, then falſe Doctrine in <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> for it is like an unſuſpected infection, moſt probable to ſpread further, to ſink deeper, and to tarry longer: Again, falſe <hi>worſhip</hi> in <hi>praying</hi> doth infinitely more diſhonour God, then falſe <hi>Doctrine</hi> in <hi>preaching,</hi> becauſe it more immediately diſhonoreth him; that is to ſay, not only in his truth by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, but alſo in his very nature and eſſence by blaſphemy: For though a man may preach blaſphemy as well as pray it, yet he that preacheth blaſphemy, blaſphemeth God only to men, but he that prayeth blaſphemy, blaſphemeth God to his own face: Wherefore the Church muſt needs take a moſt ſpecial care of <hi>prayer,</hi> if ſhe deſire to diſcharge her truſt either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man;</hi> in regard of God as ſhe is obliged to ſhew forth his glory; in regard of men as ſhe is obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their ſalvation.</p>
                           <p>And indeed for ſo doing the Church hath very good <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> and <hi>Precept,</hi> and <hi>Promiſe;</hi> Her Precedent is God; her
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:114933:327"/>
Precept and Promiſe are from God. Her Precedent is God, who having taught ſo many heavenly forms of prayer in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word, did in the very act of teaching them, as it were cry out to his Church, <hi>Vade &amp; fac ſimiliter, Go then and do likewiſe;</hi> For if the Jews examples of ſin were regiſtred for our inſtruction, (as the Apoſtle plainly affirmeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11.) then much more <hi>Gods example</hi> of Righteouſneſs; And he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Moſes</hi> to do all things exactly according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern ſhewed in the Mount, when as yet he ſhewed him but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>out ſide</hi> and the <hi>out-works</hi> of the Tabernacle, doth much more command his Church exactly to follow his example, ſince he hath been pleaſed to ſhew her the very <hi>inſide</hi> and <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> of Religion; aad therefore if the <hi>Tabernable,</hi> then ſurely much more the <hi>ſervice</hi> of the Tabernacle is to be framed and ordered according to his pattern; Thus much for <hi>Precedent,</hi> but for <hi>Precept</hi> we have much more; Firſt in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God commanded the children of Iſrael <hi>to bring pure Oyl Olive, beaten for the light, to cauſe the lamps to burn continually, Lev.</hi> 24. 2. This command reacheth us; for he that would have well beaten Oyl for his lamp, will not be contented with extempore effuſions, but will have well ſtudied and elaborated expreſſions for his <hi>homage;</hi> unleſs we will ſay he did more regard their <hi>Typical,</hi> then he doth our <hi>real</hi> worſhip.</p>

For we are alike indebted to all three Perſons of the bleſſed Trinity <hi>in regard of our prayers;</hi> The Father <hi>accepteth,</hi> the Son <hi>recommendeth</hi> the Holy Ghoſt <hi>ſuggeſteth</hi> them; nay indeed, if they be truly acceptable, they are <hi>ſuggeſted</hi> to us from the Father, for the Son, and by the Holy-Ghoſt. And this was the grand reaſon, that the primitive Chriſtians did gather out of the holy Scriptures the greateſt part of their publ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, if not of their private devotions, becauſe they were ſure that all ſuch prayers as they found in the holy Bible, came to them from the Holy Ghoſt and they could not deſire better <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> then his in their <hi>mouths,</hi> as not better motions then his in their <hi>hearts,</hi> not doubting but God would readily hear the words, as he would readily own the <hi>motions</hi> of his own ſpirit; <hi>For this is the confidence that we all have in the Son of God, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us, (1 Joh.</hi> 5. 14.) and we cannot but think that one ready way to ask any thing <hi>according to his will,</hi> is to ask it <hi>according to his words;</hi> And <hi>his</hi> are all the words that are written either by the Prophers or by the Apoſtles for our inſtruction, for they all came <hi>from,</hi> they all lead <hi>to</hi> the <hi>eternal word:</hi> So that in truth, all thoſe heavenly forms of prayer and praiſe which we meet with in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, are no other then ſo many <hi>ſet forms</hi> of infallible and impeccable Liturgy given to the Church <hi>from</hi> God the Father, <hi>through</hi> God the Son, and <hi>by</hi> God the Holy Ghoſt; and the Church would ſhew but little <hi>dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and leſs <hi>thankfulneſs,</hi> if ſhe did not accordingly make a <hi>frequent</hi> and a <hi>good</hi> uſe of them in her own Liturgies, or if ſhe did not make Liturgies of her own, both <hi>in imitation</hi> of thoſe, and <hi>in obedience</hi> to thoſe Liturgies, which ſhe hath received from God.</p>
                           <p>And as for the <hi>uſing</hi> ſet forms, it is no leſs recommended to the Church by the Spirit of God, then is the making them; Thus in the ninth of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> we find eight ſeveral Levites Praying and Preaching at one time, each in his ſeveral congregation; for the multitude was ſo great, that it was divided into eight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,

But we all with open face beholding as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord:</hi> They who moſt look on the Lord in the looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs of his own word, do moſt behold his glory; And they who moſt behold his <hi>glory</hi> are moſt changed into his <hi>image,</hi> from glory to glory, even as by his Spirit, becauſe <hi>from his word;</hi> for his Spirit is inſeparably with his Word; And therefore we may ſafely ſay, that no man yet ever devoutly uſed any form of prayer, or of praiſe which the Holy Ghoſt hath preſcibed, but by <hi>uſing</hi> it devoutly, he both <hi>exerciſed</hi> and alſo <hi>increaſed</hi> his own <hi>devotion,</hi> being the more inflamed with the love of making ſuch ſpiritual addreſſes to his God, and the more enabled to make them: which is a truth dogmatically aſſerted by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Jews, and experimentally verified by many Chriſtians, who have then chiefly found the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt from their prayers, when they have prayed in his own words; the firſt proof whereof was in the Apoſtles themſelves, who after they had been threatned by the Rulers of the Jews, made choice of the ſecond <hi>Pſalm</hi> for a great part of their prayer, and the Text ſaith plainly, that <hi>when they had prayed, the place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, Act.</hi> 4. 31. This is the firſt proof we meet with among Chriſtians of Gods publick accepting the words of the Holy Ghoſt in the mouths of men; but there was one long before this among the Jews, even in King <hi>Solomons</hi> time, when upon the Prieſts ſinging the 136. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> God gave a viſible ſign of his acceptance. For ſo it is ſaid, <hi>When they lift up their voice with the trumpets, and cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, and inſtruments of muſick, and praiſed the Lord, ſaying, For he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever,</hi> (which words are repeated in every verſe of the 136. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew it was that <hi>Pſalm</hi> they ſung) <hi>that then the houſe was filled with a cloud, even the houſe of the Lord; ſo that the Prieſts could not ſtand to Miniſter, by reaſon of the cloud; for the glory of the Lord had filled the houſe of God, 2 Chron.</hi> 5. 13, 14.

What can be ſaid more for the uſe of ſet forms of publick prayer, but that God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt hath <hi>made</hi> them, hath <hi>appointed</hi> them, hath <hi>approved</hi> them, hath <hi>accepted</hi> them? For in that he hath accepted theſe in the Text, he hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us that he would reject none which ſhould be made in imitation of theſe; Let any man ſhew but half ſo much for <hi>extemporary</hi> and <hi>unpremeditated effuſions,</hi> and we ſhall be ſo far from denying him the uſe of his <hi>pretended liberty,</hi> that we ſhall be glad to exempt him from the accuſation of a <hi>pretence</hi> in his <hi>affected piety.</hi> In the mean time, as God himſelf did not think it ſufficient to teach his Church to pray, only by giving <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules,</hi> but alſo by giving <hi>particular forms</hi> of Prayer, ſo Gods Church could not think it ſufficient to teach his people to pray without making for them ſuch particular forms, as ſhould be ſure to keep them to the general Rules, becauſe if ſhe had not done ſo, ſhe had been guilty of a great <hi>omiſſion,</hi> for not following the example of Gods unerring perfection in teaching; and of a great <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> for ſuffering the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (committed to her charge) to follow the miſguidance of their own manifold and great imperfections, for want of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught: Again, <hi>Hezekiah the King, and the Princes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Levites to ſing praiſe unto the Lord, with the words of</hi> David <hi>and of</hi> Aſaph <hi>the Seer, and they ſang praiſes with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they bowed their heads and worſhipped, 2 Chron.</hi> 29. 30.

Becauſe thereby our Reformers intended the promotion of true Chriſtian Communion, by not making a <hi>needleſs,</hi> much leſs a <hi>ſcandalous</hi> ſeparation from other Chriſtians, in thoſe devotions wherein they had not ſeparated from Chriſt. 2. Becauſe they intended to promote true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion in the ſame way that Chriſt himſelf had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted it, which was by not changing any good prayers he found in publick uſe at his coming; for even in his own moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer wherein he taught his Apoſtles, and in them all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians how to pray till the worlds end, he made choice of ſuch <hi>laudable forms</hi> as he then found uſed by the Jews: In ſo much that there is not one <hi>petition</hi> in this moſt Chriſtian prayer, which was not before ſome piece of a <hi>prayer</hi> in the Jewiſh Synagogue; which hath been largely and fully proved, by Mr. <hi>John Gregory</hi> of Chriſt-Church, and needs no other proof after ſo compleat an Artiſt; Yet I will add the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of one more, beyond all exception (both for his learning and for his Religion) and that was the moſt learned and moſt judicious <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> who in his Annotations on <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 9. hath theſe words, <hi>Docent autem nos ea quae ex Hebraeorum libris ab aliis ſunt citata non tam formulam hanc à Chriſto ſuis verbis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptam, quam in eam congeſtum quicquid in Hebraeorum precibus erat laudabile; ſicut &amp; in admonitionibus paſſim utitur notis eo

ſaeculo proverbiis: Tam longe abfuit ipſe Dominus Eccleſiae ab omni affectatione non neceſſariae novitatis: Thoſe things which have been cited by others out of the Jews writings do plainly ſhew that our Saviour Chriſt did not ſo truly make this form of prayer new of himſelf, as he did take it out of the Jews laudable prayers which he found ready made to his hands; even as in his Sermons he did commonly uſe ſuch Proverbs, as that age was beſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with; So far was he that was Lord of the Church, from all affectation of unneceſſary novelty;</hi> An excellent Epiphonema, which hath in it a <hi>manifeſt document</hi> for all Chriſtian Churches, that they ought to follow the example of their Lord, in being far from affectation of unneceſſary novelty in thoſe prayers which they teach and practiſe; And a <hi>tacit approbation</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe in that particular ſhe had ſo exactly followed her Lords example; ſhe had made her Liturgy pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually according to the Lords moſt holy prayer, as in all <hi>other</hi> reſpects, ſo alſo in <hi>this,</hi> that ſhe would not have it guilty of unneceſſary novelty, which if ſhe had not done, ſhe muſt have tempted <hi>others</hi> to <hi>ſchiſm</hi> and <hi>ſeparation,</hi> and have tempted <hi>her ſelf</hi> to <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>preſumption:</hi> Therefore ſhe was willing to leave the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as to her <hi>corruption,</hi> but not as to her <hi>Communion,</hi> nor did <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf deſire ſhe ſhould do more, (in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Frankford</hi>) wherein he was only troubled that ſome of our Nation were ſtill too much immerſed in the dregs of Popery; <hi>Quid ſibi velint neſcio, quos faecis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſticae reliquiae tantopere delectant;</hi> So that tis an injury to that learned man to ſay he would have the Church of <hi>England</hi> make no diſtinction between the <hi>good wine of Chriſtianity,</hi> and the <hi>dregs or lees of Popery,</hi> which they in effect do ſay, who are ſo ready to quote him for aboliſhing any thing that was truly Chriſtian, in the reformation of our Liturgy: But let us particularly examine the excellencies of the Lords moſt holy prayer, that we may from thence the more eaſily diſcern the excellencies of our own prayers; which can have no excellency but as they follow the pattern of <hi>this,</hi> and if they follow <hi>this,</hi> need look after no other excellency: For this prayer hath Chriſt in all its four cauſes, and is therefore moſt peculiarly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled unto him; 1. <hi>Ratione efficientis,</hi> in regard of its <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> cauſe, becauſe he was the compoſer of it, there's <hi>Chriſt,

                           <p>For my part, I muſt profeſs, that as a Chriſtian Divine, I have beſtowed much pains in viewing the Chriſtian forms of publick worſhip, and I cannot yet find any one Liturgy in all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to which I can willingly and with a good conſcience ſay <hi>Amen</hi> in all particulars, ſave only <hi>This</hi> of our own Church, with which I cannot but moſt heartily and willingly joyn in every prayer, and the rather, becauſe I find This Liturgy hath in it all the chiefeſt pious and pithy <hi>devotions</hi> of Greek and Latine Liturgies, but the <hi>ſuperſtitions</hi> of neither: And I am willing to perſwade my ſelf that other men (eſpecially of my <hi>calling</hi>) would not ſo eaſily <hi>forſake,</hi> much leſs ſo openly <hi>revile</hi> this publick form of worſhip, if they did ſeriouſly conſider how directly it tends to Gods glory and his peoples good, and how much it belongs to the Churches Truſt that her publick worſhip ſhould directly tend to <hi>both;</hi> For ſurely it is a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable priviledge of Piety that we can joyn in Prayer with Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and all the other Greek and Latine Fathers, nay with Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who if they were preſent at our ſervice, would not refuſe to communicate in
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:114933:339"/>
our prayers (whatever our own ſeduced Brethren may refuſe) becauſe they are all eaſily and plainly reducible to the Lords moſt holy Prayer: In ſo much that we do not only in our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief glorifie God as they did, (and truly the repeating of the Creed doth more truly glorifie God, then any other Profeſſion of his Truth, which we can make) but alſo in our prayers we invocate him as they did, whereby we do not only <hi>ſpeculatively profeſs</hi> or acknowledge, but alſo <hi>practically maintain</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> and are ſure we ſhall both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and practiſe that communion, if we communicate with our own Church, which hath ſuch a form of worſhip as doth <hi>profeſs</hi> and <hi>practiſe</hi> it: For we are ſure that we Pray as they once prayed, whiles we are ſure that we pray according to the Lords own moſt holy Prayer, which certainly they muſt needs want, who do not before-hand know their <hi>Form</hi> of Prayer; but come firſt to <hi>Hear,</hi> and then to <hi>Pray;</hi> ſo that if the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er chance to abuſe their <hi>Patience</hi> by ſome new-found upſtart <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> in his Sermon, They may be ſure he will much more abuſe their <hi>Piety</hi> by ſome new-found upſtart <hi>Devotion</hi> in his Prayer, ſince his buſineſs is to turn his Sermon into his Prayer, and that may be either of ſo bad <hi>contents,</hi> or of ſo bad <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,</hi> as to turn their Prayer into <hi>Nothing.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is not to be denyed but this <hi>may be done</hi> eaſily: it is to be feared this <hi>is done</hi> frequently among thoſe who have no other Prayers but ſuch as the Preacher is pleaſed to make for them; whoſe Faith may be <hi>Faction</hi> in his Sermon, and whoſe Religion may be <hi>Rebellion</hi> in his Prayer, ſo that the Congregation which dependeth meerly upon his lips, muſt have no Prayers, if they will not be factious and rebellious, or muſt have Profanations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Prayers, if they will; For it is not to be imagined that ſuch Miniſters who pull down their Church to ſet up <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> will not ſtand on Tip-toe, as well in <hi>Praying</hi> as in <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that they may obtain a full <hi>Dictatorſhip</hi> in Religion, whiles every one of them takes upon him to Lord it in Gods houſe, as if God had given him Commiſſion to ſay with <hi>Elijah, As the Lord God of Iſrael liveth; before whom I ſtand, there ſhall not be dew nor rain theſe years,</hi> (neither dew of heavenly Doctrine, nor rain of heavenly devotion to refreſh your gaſping ſouls) <hi>but according to my word, 1 King.</hi> 17. 1. For they all in the

end drive at this, <hi>that we ſhould</hi> in effect have <hi>no prayers,</hi> though at firſt they would be thought to adviſe us to <hi>better prayers.</hi> The firſt Edition of their <hi>Anti-prayer</hi> Book, though it had this proud poſie in its fore-head, <hi>No man can lay any other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then that which is laid, even Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> yet within two years after, being reviewed by themſelves, was in a manner quite changed, and had not ſo few as 600. grand and material alterations: And yet for all this, within another year, a third Book was begotten and brought forth, differing in many points from both the other, as if they had reſolved to make good that reproach which once <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> caſt upon the <hi>Lutherans, Quid nunc credant benè novi, quid autem anno ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenti credituri ſunt, prorſus ignoro, (Magal. Praef. in Titum, ſec. 3. annot.</hi> 4.) What they now believe I well know, but what they will believe the next year, I know not. He might have ſaid concerning our Changelings, <hi>Nor they themſelves:</hi> For they changed groſly thrice in leſs then four years; But this third Book was thought ſo compleat, that ſome earneſtly preſſed to have the ſame allowed by publick Authority, not with intent that there ſhould be preſcribed <hi>a ſet form</hi> of publick prayer, (miſtake them not, for they can endure none, no not of their own making; They that cannot agree <hi>as Chriſtians</hi> to pray as Chriſt taught them, will never agree <hi>as Brethren</hi> to pray as they ſhall teach one another:) But only to throw aſide that ſet Form, which was preſcribed in the Common-Prayer Book: For although they durſt not be ſo <hi>outragiouſly impious</hi> as to make it their profeſſion, that they would have no ſet form of Prayer, yet they were ſo <hi>impiouſly ſubdolous,</hi> as to make it their deſign to have none: And therefore though for a ſhew they had <hi>made</hi> ſome ſet Prayers, yet they meant never to <hi>uſe</hi> them: For in their Rubrick they ſtill give themſelves this liberty, That the Miniſter ſhall pray thus, <hi>or elſe to this ſame purpoſe,</hi> as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſhall move his heart: So that the Miniſter is in truth left to himſelf, (which ought not to be, becauſe the Church or Miniſtry in <hi>general,</hi> and not each Miniſter in <hi>particular</hi> is Gods Truſtee for publick worſhip) and the people are wholly left to the piety and diſcretion of their Miniſter; (which ought leſs to be, becauſe it is a ready way to bring Gods publick worſhip under the <hi>danger,</hi> if not under the <hi>guilt</hi> of Impiety and Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion:)
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:114933:340"/>
For if the Miniſter conceiving a Prayer upon the ſudden, ſhall ſay, <hi>the Spirit moved his heart to pray ſo;</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſhall avouch his prayer to have been to the ſame purpoſe with that which was preſcribed him, though God may be juſtly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him for entitling his enormities to the Holy Ghoſt, yet the people may not juſtly be offended with him for making uſe of his liberty, though they have the greateſt cauſe of juſt offence which can be given to any Chriſtians, even the <hi>loſs of their Piety,</hi> and <hi>the danger of their patience,</hi> or to ſpeak yet plainer, even <hi>the reproach of their Communion,</hi> and <hi>the ſcandal of their Religion.</hi>

It remains in the next place to be proved that no Church ought to aſſume that power: For it is not for any Chriſtian Church to aſſume ſuch a power as directly tends to the deſtruction ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſtian Religion, or of Chriſtian Communion; and aboliſhing of Liturgy directly tends to both theſe, as hath been ſaid: Again, It is not for any Chriſtian Church to aſſume ſuch a power, as to aboliſh any thing which directly tends to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of any of Gods Commandments, (for our Saviour Chriſt hath ſaid) <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments, John</hi> 14. 15. But a true laudable form of prayer directly tends to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of two of Gods Commandments, to wit the third and the fourth; It directly tends to the fulfilling of the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, in that it keeps ſome from taking Gods name in vain, and teaches others truly to glorifie his name; And it directly tends to the fulfilling of the fourth Commandment, in that it provides for the duty of the Sabbath, to wit <hi>the ſervice of the Sanctuary, the publick worſhip of God,</hi> which is the <hi>end</hi> of the fourth Commandment, and therefore the fitteſt rule by which to expound and obſerve the <hi>letter</hi> of it: For the <hi>letter</hi> of the Law being ſubſervient to the <hi>end</hi> of the Law, we cannot rightly obſerve the <hi>day</hi> according to the <hi>letter,</hi> unleſs we rightly obſerve the <hi>duty</hi> according to the <hi>end</hi> of this Commandment: For by the reaſon of our bleſſed Saviours own Logick, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23.)

the edification of Piety: For all the world is not able to prove that the Gift of prayer is either a means of engrafting a man in Chriſt, or a teſtimony that he is ingrafted in him; ſo that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould much <hi>rejoyce</hi> (though they commonly do <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>) in their preheminence who have it, or they ſhould be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed</hi> for their defects who have it not: For that holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which is exerciſed with God by Prayer, is altogether <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> in an holy <hi>attention</hi> and <hi>affection</hi> which belongs to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer, not at all <hi>earthly</hi> or <hi>carnal,</hi> in a ready <hi>apprehenſion</hi> or a voluble <hi>expreſſion,</hi> which two alone properly belong to the <hi>Gift</hi> of Prayer; For as concerning ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural aſſiſtance, (as was heretofore in Miracles and in Tongues) there is little reaſon to ſuppoſe or mention it in the Gift of Prayer. 1. Becauſe thoſe men amongſt us who moſt have it, have it not in any other language, but only in that which is to them moſt <hi>natural,</hi> even in their own mother-tongue. 2. Becauſe thoſe men who have it, do ſo much blame and revile thoſe who have it not, which ſure they would not do, if they themſelves thought it <hi>ſupernatural;</hi> For in the Gift of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency they are contented to conſult with humane infirmity, for an allay of any harſh cenſures in thoſe that want it: And why not ſo alſo in the Gift of Prayer, if both were alike (in their conceits) ſupernatural? And yet if we ſhould ſuppoſe a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural aſſiſtance in the Gift of Prayer, it would little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage either <hi>it</hi> or <hi>them;</hi> For we ſee the Spirit of God did over-rule the tongue of <hi>Balaam,</hi> when he uttered that moſt heavenly Prayer, <hi>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his, (Numb.</hi> 23. 10.) though the ſame Spirit did not ſanctifie his heart, <hi>for he loved the waies of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 15. Wherefore it is plain, A man may be a <hi>member</hi> of Chriſt without the Gift of Prayer, becauſe it is not a Gift that immediately flows from the grace of <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And as plain, that a man may lawfully and laudably be a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of Chriſt without it, (as well as without the Gift of Continency) becauſe it is not a Gift that either principally or neceſſarily tends to <hi>edification.</hi> Not <hi>principally;</hi> for ſet forms of Prayer taken out of the holy Scriptures, or made agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, do edifie much more, as having more ſuitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions both to <hi>engage</hi> and to <hi>enlarge</hi> holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He that hath not the <hi>Gift</hi> of Prayer, may not for that reaſon neglect the <hi>duty</hi> of prayer in private: And he that hath the <hi>gift</hi> of prayer, may not for that reaſon diſturb the <hi>Duty</hi> of Prayer in publick: Wherefore ſince publick Prayer is a Duty that no more belongs to <hi>One</hi> then to <hi>All,</hi> no more belongs to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> then to the <hi>People;</hi> (for the fourth Commandement ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth <hi>them</hi> to Gods publick worſhip as well as <hi>him,</hi> in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement <hi>of,</hi> and homage <hi>for</hi> the redemption of mankind) it is manifeſt, it ought to be ſo ordered, that Miniſter and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may as one man, with one voice and with one heart Pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, not only in one company, but alſo in one Communion.

For faith is grounded upon infallibility, which now cannot be in the <hi>Perſons,</hi> and therefore muſt be in the <hi>Prayers,</hi> and hence ariſeth the neceſſity of a ſet form of publick Prayer, that the People as well as the Prieſts may pray in faith in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and not only one, but alſo (many) ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations may conſtitute no more then one and the ſame Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion: For that Precept, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order,</hi> was given to the whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and with it a power of making <hi>publick Prayer,</hi> as a <hi>Duty,</hi> over-rule <hi>publick Prayer</hi> as a <hi>Gift:</hi> For by the ſame reaſon that the Church hath power to regulate the <hi>gift of tongues,</hi> it hath alſo power to regulate the <hi>gift of Prayer,</hi> which is chiefly ſeated in the tongue; and ſince unknown matter and form in Prayers is no leſs againſt the edification of the People as to praying in faith, then an unknown dialect, the Church may as juſtly prohibit the <hi>one,</hi> as the <hi>other;</hi> and the pretence of a Gift may in neither e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervate the Churches prohibition. Again, The Church is bound to uſe her Gift of Tongues for the peoples good, and why not alſo her Gift of Prayer? and how can ſhe uſe that Gift with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making of a ſet form? The ſame Church is entruſted with the ordering of Religion, and how ſhall any Miniſter either <hi>preſumptuouſly</hi> invade her Truſt, or <hi>contumaciouſly</hi> opppſe her order? Nay on the contrary, every Miniſter is bound to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his gifts to the order of the Church; for ſo is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> abſolute determination, <hi>The Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 32. that is, The Spirits of the Prophets ought not to be refractory, inſolent and imperious, but modeſt, obedient and ſubmiſs, not given to <hi>contention</hi> but <hi>compliance,</hi> not to <hi>contradiction</hi> but <hi>condeſcention,</hi> not deſpiſing others, but ſubmitting themſelves: For he that placed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>above</hi> a private man, hath placed that Prophet <hi>under</hi> the other Prophets.

                           <p>1. That the work of the Miniſtry will be as fully (but more orderly) diſcharged, <hi>For ye may all propheſie one by one, Verſ.</hi> 31.</p>

                           <p>He that will not be induced by theſe arguments to ſubmit his gift to the Churches gift in the publick exerciſe of Devotion, plainly ſheweth that though he may have the <hi>Gift,</hi> yet he hath not the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Spirit: And indeed it is no wonder that theſe two ſhould be divided; for common gifts of the Spirit, ſuch as tend only to the edification of others, and not to a mans own ſanctification, are often given without ſaving grace; And ſuch a gift we muſt acknowledge the Gift of Prayer, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered preciſely in it ſelf) becauſe we doubt not but <hi>Judas</hi> had it as well as the reſt of the Apoſtles, and yet we dare not ſay that he had ſanctifying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grace: We muſt therefore diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Gift</hi> of Prayer; The <hi>Spirit of prayer</hi> conſiſteth in an holy and firm attention, in ſanctified and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged affections, and proceedeth wholly from the infuſion of Grace: But the <hi>gift of Prayer</hi> (as this age is pleaſed to call it, though without Gods warrant in the Text) conſiſteth in the readineſs of apprehenſion, and the fitneſs of expreſſion, and proceedeth partly from the <hi>endowments</hi> of nature, partly from the <hi>confidence</hi> of cuſtom, and partly from the <hi>acquiſitions</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; For theſe three, <hi>Nature, Cuſtom,</hi> and <hi>Induſtry,</hi> are all neceſſarily required to the attaining of that faculty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man is enabled upon all occaſional emergencies or neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, fittingly to expreſs the deſires of his heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by fitting expreſſions to enflame and to enlarge thoſe deſires, as well in himſelf as in thoſe that hear him; which I think will afford us the full definition of the Gift of prayer (conſidered preciſely in it ſelf without the Spirit of prayer) not only eſſentially, but alſo cauſally: For ſo the efficient cauſe thereof is <hi>nature, cuſtom</hi> and <hi>induſtry,</hi> (though nature and cuſtom more then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, in ſo much that men of natural endowments, and of perſonal confidences, do often in this gift out-ſtrip thoſe of moſt induſtrious improvements, whereby nature and cuſtom
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:114933:348"/>
are frequently animated to laugh and ſcorn at learning and induſtry:) The material cauſe thereof is occaſional emergencies or neceſſities: The formal cauſe thereof is readineſs of apprehenſion, and fitneſs of expreſſion: The final cauſe thereof is to enflame and enlarge the deſires of the heart: Tell me, what can any true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ſee in this Dagon of the <hi>Philiſtians,</hi> that the Ark of God ſhould fall down before it, and not rather it ſhould fall down before the Ark; For all this while if the deſires be truly good, ſuch as indeed ought to be <hi>enflamed</hi> or <hi>enlarged,</hi> that is not to be aſcribed to the <hi>Gift,</hi> but only to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer. So that in truth the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer is as much above the <hi>Gift</hi> of Prayer, as an holy <hi>affection</hi> is above a quick <hi>imagination</hi> or a voluble <hi>expreſſion,</hi> and a ſanctified <hi>heart</hi> is above a ready <hi>wit</hi> or an elaborated <hi>tongue;</hi> For theſe two, (I mean the Spirit and the Gift of Prayer) muſt neceſſarily be ſeparated, becauſe they are very dangerouſly confounded; the common ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple admiring theſe men as almoſt <hi>Angels,</hi> who have the Gift without the Spirit, and contemning thoſe Miniſters, as ſcarce <hi>men;</hi> who have the Spirit without the Gift; For many good Chriſtians have the Spirit of Prayer, who have not the Gift of Prayer; ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, The Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us with groanings,</hi> there's the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer, but <hi>with groanings which cannot be uttered,</hi> there is not the <hi>Gift</hi> of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.) And on the other ſide, many pernicious hypocrites may have the <hi>Gift</hi> of Prayer, who have not the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of Prayer; ſo ſaith our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Woe unto you hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who for a pretence make long Prayers, Mat.</hi> 23. 14. And again, <hi>Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name have caſt out devils, and in thy name have done many wonderful works? And then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you, depart from me ye that work iniquity, Mat.</hi> 7. See here how Gifted men may be Hypocrites, not only <hi>gifted for Praying, Many will ſay unto me Lord, Lord,</hi> (which repetition ſhews a familiarity they thought they had contracted with him by their frequent addreſſes in Prayer) but alſo <hi>gifted for Preaching, Have we not propheſied in thy name?</hi> Nay gifted for caſting out Devils, (out of others, though not out of themſelves) <hi>And in thy name have caſt out Devils?</hi>
                              <pb n="654" facs="tcp:114933:349"/>
And yet to theſe <hi>gifted men</hi> will our bleſſed Saviour return this anſwer, <hi>I never knew you;</hi> whence we may juſtly infer they never truly knew him, <hi>Depart from me ye that work iniquity;</hi> whence we may as juſtly infer, that they did never <hi>really</hi> come near him by <hi>piety,</hi> but only <hi>ſeemingly</hi> by <hi>hypocriſie.</hi> God forbid but we ſhould firmly believe, and willingly confeſs that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Gift of Prayer though ſeparated in Hypocrites, are often joyned together in good Chriſtians; for in truth the gift of Prayer is not perfect and compleat, (ſo as to be worth the looking after) without the Spirit of it: For then only is the gift of Prayer compleat, when not only <hi>natural</hi> abilities are improved by ſtudy or induſtry, and <hi>perſonal</hi> abilities are acquired by art or exerciſe, (which two alone do properly conſtitute the very eſſence of the Gift of Prayer) But alſo the heart is ſanctified by Grace; (which properly belongs only to the Spirit of Prayer:) ſo that in truth the Gift of prayer, which makes all the noiſe, is perfected only by the Spirit of Prayer which ſaith nothing, or ſpeaketh ſo ſoftly that none can hear its voice, but <hi>he that ſearcheth the hearts, and knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, Rom.</hi> 8. 27.

For when the Text hath ſet this down as a proper compellation of God, <hi>O thou that heareſt prayer, (Pſal.</hi> 65. 2.) it is moſt evident that from his ſaying he would not hear, we may ſafely conclude, they did not <hi>Pray,</hi> though they did make never ſo many prayers.

becauſe publick prayer is to have a publick Perſon to perform it; And none can be a publick Perſon in Gods ſervice, but whom God himſelf hath made ſo by ſome notorious and undoubted Commiſſion, ſuch as others are bound to <hi>acknowledge,</hi> and therefore bound not to <hi>uſurp; For the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his name in vain;</hi> but they moſt take his name in vain, who ſpeak in his name without his allowance: They are moſt properly ſaid to <hi>take</hi> his name, becauſe he hath not given it; and to take it in <hi>vain,</hi> becauſe they take it rather to ſerve <hi>themſelves</hi> then to ſerve <hi>him:</hi> 'Tis all one for ſtrange Perſons to offer themſelves before the Lord inſtead of the ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and for the ſons of <hi>Aaron</hi> to offer ſtrange fire before the Lord inſtead of that from his own Altar; for of both alike it may be ſaid, <hi>which he commanded them not, Numb.</hi> 10. 1. and for both alike it hath been ſaid, <hi>And they dyed before the Lord, Ver.</hi> 2. and again, <hi>This is it that the Lord ſpake, ſaying, I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified, Ver.</hi> 3. If he be not ſanctified in them that come nigh him, he is not like to be glorified before all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; If the Prieſts be <hi>unſanctified,</hi> the Lord will be <hi>unglorified;</hi> for his Majeſty will be contemned, as if it were lawful for any that are <hi>not ſanctified,</hi> to come nigh him: Therefore his Prieſts were firſt ſanctified <hi>to</hi> the Prieſthood, then ſanctified <hi>by</hi> it: They were firſt ſanctified by being called, then ſanctified by their calling: And ſo ought their ſucceſſors to be till the worlds end; for it is an univerſal negative, which denies as well for all times as for all perſons, <hi>No man taketh this honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God as was</hi> Aaron, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. Now <hi>Aaron</hi> was called not only <hi>internally</hi> to ſatisfie himſelf, but alſo <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> to ſatisfie all the Congregation that he was called of God; For God is the God of order, not of confuſion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently forbids thoſe men to officiate as <hi>his Miniſters</hi> (though of never ſo great abilities) whom he hath not outwardly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> For he will have order, not confuſion in his Church, whereas if any one might officiate in the Miniſtry, (upon any pretence whatſoever) without Gods outward call, others might as well as he, and ſo we muſt needs have an irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diable confuſion both in the Miniſters and in their miniſtrations: Dares any man to be a Princes Ambaſſador (though moſt able

to do him ſervice) without his appointment? But the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are <hi>Gods Ambaſſadors, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 20. There needs no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of arguments in this caſe; for till earthly Potentates ſhall declare it to be no rebellion againſt themſelves for men to turn <hi>uncommiſsioned ſouldiers,</hi> under pretence of fighting their battles, they muſt acknowledge it to be grand rebellion againſt the King of heaven, for men to turn <hi>uncommiſſioned Miniſters,</hi> under pretence of doing him ſervice; For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having ſaid, <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 4. hath in effect told us, that the Miniſter is Gods ſouldier; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſure of his Commiſſion: But let us further examine this gift of Prayer in relation to the publick worſhip of God, and as we find no juſt reaſon to admit them to the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry who are not <hi>Miniſters,</hi> becauſe they have that <hi>gift;</hi> ſo we ſhall find no juſt reaſon to reject thoſe that are true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as inſufficient or unfit for the work of the Miniſtry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have <hi>it</hi> not; nor to allow ſuch Miniſters, who have it, to reject the ſet forms eſtabliſhed and approved by the Church: For if any reaſon may be given why <hi>ungifted</hi> men ſhould be thought not ſufficiently <hi>qualified</hi> for the Miniſtry; or ſet Prayers not ſufficiently qualified for <hi>gifted men;</hi> That reaſon muſt relate either to God, or to the People, or to the Miniſters. But they who conſult with their conſciences before they ſpeak, and then ſpeak according to the reſult of thoſe conſultations, are not afraid to averr, That in all theſe reſpects it is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that the publick worſhip of God ſhould not rely upon the <hi>perſonal abilities</hi> of the Miniſters in praying, but ſhould be performed and diſcharged by <hi>conſtant ſet forms</hi> of Prayer; not by <hi>uncertain,</hi> and much leſs by <hi>premeditated</hi> effuſions.</p>
                           <p>1.

<pb n="657" facs="tcp:114933:350"/>
of zeal and ſincerity, which are both to be in it as it is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtian Religion; Nor yet for want of extent or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality, which is to be in it, as it is a duty of Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                           <p>2. It is requiſite that the publick worſhip of God ſhould not rely upon the perſonal abilities of the Miniſters in praying, but ſhould be performed by conſtant ſet forms of prayer, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the people, becauſe they are thereby more truly edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>being edified in their underſtandings,</hi> not led on hood-winckt by an implicite ſaith to blind obedience, in the greateſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of Religion; <hi>Being edified in their wills,</hi> not diſtracted by attention, when they ſhould be united in affection; for the ſoul being finite cannot be wholly buſied in the one, but it muſt partly neglect the other: And alſo <hi>being edified in their memories;</hi> for by often hearing the ſame prayers, they are taught to pray when their occaſions will not permit them to reſort to the houſe of prayer: In a word, <hi>being edified in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> in that they are taught and inured to come to the holy work of Religion, not <hi>as Judges</hi> to make them proud and cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, nor <hi>as ſpies</hi> to make them peeviſh and captious, but <hi>as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants,</hi> to make them devout and Religious.</p>
                           <p>For whilſt the Miniſter is praying what the people know not beforehand, they are in truth but <hi>as Judges,</hi> unleſs you will have them reſign their ſouls upon uncertainties; But whilſt they are praying with him in a known form of prayer, they are certainly <hi>as Communicants:</hi> Therefore it is an unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble injury to the people to be tied to ſpeak to God in prayer on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the mouth of their Miniſter: Firſt, <hi>becauſe it doth not ſatisfie their conſciences,</hi> which cannot be ſatisfied but with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as well as piety; for though the will or affection may aſſent to a deſire in a prayer not known before, yet not with the ſame full aſſent as if it had been known, partly becauſe the ſoul is aſſenting whilſt it is praying, and ſo what it beſtows upon one act, it takes from the other: and partly, becauſe the ſoul cannot aſſent ſo fully nor ſo firmly upon the ſuddain, as it can upon deliberation; not ſo <hi>fully,</hi> becauſe not upon the ſame evidence; not ſo <hi>firmly,</hi> becauſe not upon the ſame aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith: Secondly, <hi>becauſe it doth diſturb, if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their Communion with Chriſt,</hi> which is the chief end that
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:114933:351"/>
Chriſtians ought to aim at in all their prayers: For not being ſure that their prayer will be ſuch as to joyn their Saviour with them in the ſame interceſſion, they cannot be ſure it will be ſuch as to joyn them with their Saviour in the ſame Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo they are in danger of loſing both the <hi>benefit</hi> and the <hi>comfort</hi> of all their publick prayers; for the benefit of them depends altogether upon Chriſts interceſſion, the comfort of them depends altogether upon Chriſts Communion. Thirdly, <hi>becauſe it doth diſturb, if not deſtroy their Communion one with another,</hi> which deſtructive way ought to be moſt carefully avoided and moſt hatefully deteſted by all good Chriſtians: For next to the <hi>breach of piety</hi> in Religion, they ought to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the <hi>breach of charity</hi> in Communion; For love and concord is the very ſoul of Chriſtianity; <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another, Joh.</hi> 13. 35. And it was the Characteriſtical note of the firſt and beſt Chriſtians, <hi>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one ſoul, Act.</hi> 4. 32. And doubtleſs nothing doth more immediately nor more powerfully conduce to unity in affection, then unity in Religion: Wherefore ſince the ſame common devotions are the moſt effectual means to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi> and to <hi>preſerve</hi> this unity, they who are implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the one, cannot be <hi>cordial</hi> friends to the other; It is reported of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, that after he had conceived an inveterate hatred againſt the Chriſtians, he had no readier way to execute his hatred againſt them, but by endeavouring to make them hate one another; And ſo gathering the moſt diſſenting Chriſtian Biſhops, and the moſt factious of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into his own Palace, he adviſed them to lay aſide all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil diſcords, and to keep the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> but every one ſecurely to follow his own Religion, without any regard to the <hi>peace of the Church; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t civilibus diſcordiis conſopitis, ſuae quisque Religioni ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>They ſay we diſcountenance the Gift of Prayer; we know we do not; only we prefer the Gift of Prayer in the <hi>Church,</hi> above the Gift of Prayer in particular Miniſters, or the Gift of Prayer as it is exerciſed to <hi>edification,</hi> above the ſame gift as it is or may be exerciſed to <hi>oſtentation;</hi> wherein we follow Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, who dehorteth the Miniſters of his time from arrogancy in the uſe of their ſpiritual gifts, firſt from the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of thoſe gifts, that they have them <hi>not from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> but from God; <hi>As God hath dealt to every man the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of faith.</hi> Secondly, from the final cauſe of thoſe Gifts, that they have them <hi>not for themſelves,</hi> but for their neighbours; not for oſtentation but for edification; <hi>So we being many are one body in Chriſt, and every one members one of another, Rom.</hi> 12. 3, 5.

                           <p>1.

                           <p>1. Becauſe publick prayer is the duty of the Sabbath; and that ought to be publick in its <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> that is, in its matter and form, as well as in its <hi>Accidents,</hi> that is, time, place, and perſons.</p>
                           <p>2.

                              <hi>SECT. XIV.</hi> The third and laſt part of the Churches truſt concerning Religion is touching the holy Sacraments, wherein our Church is not faulty either in the number, or in the adminiſtration of them, as exactly following our Saviours inſtitution; nor in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of adminiſtring, as following it with reverence.</head>
                           <p>REligion being above the <hi>light</hi> of nature to <hi>underſtand</hi> it, muſt needs be above the <hi>power</hi> of nature to <hi>command</hi> it; Hence the acts of the Theological vertues are preſcribed by the poſitive Law of God, becauſe they belong properly to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But the acts of moral vertues are preſcribed by the Law of nature, becauſe they belong to Reaſon; yet are they in truth injurious to Religion, who will allow nothing to be <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> but what they can prove to be <hi>natural;</hi> For the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law of God doth conſtitute moralities to the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as well as the inbred Law of nature doth conſtitute moralities to the <hi>Man:</hi> This appears plainly in the Sacraments, which are not to be accounted <hi>as Ceremonies,</hi> becauſe they come not under the authority of the Church either for their inſtitution, or alteration, or abolition, and muſt therefore be accounted as <hi>moralities,</hi> though they are not at all commanded by the Law of nature, but only by the Law of God.</p>
                           <p>That theſe Sacraments are a part of the Churches truſt, is unqueſtionable, becauſe the Goſpel is. For the vocal word, and the viſible word, <hi>Verbum Vocale, &amp; verbum viſibile,</hi> both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like are duties of the Chriſtian Religion for the glory of God, and of the Chriſtian Communion for the edification of man,
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:114933:362"/>
but all the duties both of Religion and Communion are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Churches truſt, God having appointed his own Miniſters as his ſpecial Truſtees, both for preaching his word, and for adminiſtring his Sacraments: So that no man can adminiſter a Sacrament but in the <hi>perſon of God;</hi> and he hath not licenſed every one that will, to take upon him his perſon, but only ſuch to whom he hath given his ſpecial deputation; And this is more peculiarly manifeſt concerning the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, properly ſo called, that is Baptiſm and the Lords holy Supper; For our bleſſed Saviour ſaid only to his Apoſtles, <hi>Go ye therefore and baptize,</hi> in reſpect of the one; and <hi>do ye this in remembrance of me,</hi> in reſpect of the other; As for the five additional Sacraments, they were never looked upon as integral parts of Gods ordinary publick worſhip, and therefore though they could be proved Sacraments, yet they would not come under our preſent diſcourſe; But in truth they cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Sacraments, according to the proper definition of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is this, <hi>A Sacrament is an outward viſible ſign of an inward ſpiritual grace, given to us and ordained by Chriſt himſelf, as a means to convey that grace, and as a pledge to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us thereof;</hi> Let us examine this definition by its cauſes, and we ſhall eaſily perceive that it belongs only to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Euchariſt,</hi> and therefore they two only are to be called Sacraments; Firſt, by its efficient cauſe, [<hi>Given and ordained by Chriſt himſelf</hi>] which is clear of theſe two; for they were inſtituted by him, and have his <hi>precept</hi> and <hi>promiſe</hi> in the very words of their inſtitution, which cannot be aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted concerning any of the other; Secondly, by its material cauſe, [<hi>outward viſible ſign, inward ſpiritual Grace</hi>] which are both manifeſtly known in Baptiſm and the Holy Euchariſt, but neither in any of the reſt: For <hi>Pennance</hi> hath no outward viſible ſign at all, and <hi>Matrimony, Orders, Confirmation, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream unction,</hi> have no outward viſible ſigns of Chriſts appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And much leſs have any of theſe that inward ſpiritual Grace which is annexed to Baptiſm and the Holy Euchariſt; To wit, Chriſt with all his merits and mercies whereby of God <hi>He is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30. For we dare not ſay that any man is by any of theſe five either born and initiated, or nouriſhed
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:114933:363"/>
and confirmed in Chriſt: Thirdly, by its formal cauſe, [<hi>An outward viſible ſign of an inward ſpiritual Grace.</hi>] Whereby it appears that the internal and proper form of a Sacrament is the neceſſary conjunction or connexion of the ſign and the thing ſignified; which conjunction is ſo undeniable in our two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, that Baptiſm is called the <hi>waſhing of regeneration (Tit. 3. 5.) And the holy Euchariſt the Communion of the body and blood of Chriſt, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 16. For that theſe two are not only ſigns and ſeals, but alſo conveyances of grace unto the ſoul; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other five though they have ſomething of the <hi>ſign,</hi> yet they have nothing at all of the <hi>ſeal,</hi> or of the <hi>conveyance</hi> of grace: Laſtly, by its final cauſe, [<hi>As a means to convey Grace, and as a pledge to aſſure us thereof</hi>] The end of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is partly our Communion with Chriſt, and partly our acknowledgement of that Communion: This twofold end is very apparent in Baptiſm and in the holy Euchariſt, which doth procure our Communion with Chriſt, and alſo require our acknowledgement of that Communion; but in the reſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one is without the other, or there is a want of both: For either there is no Communion with Chriſt, or there is no acknowledgement of that Communion; whereas a Sacrament is <hi>a ſeal of Gods Covenant,</hi> and therefore in its own nature is a double pledge; to wit, of Gods grace and favour to man, and of mans duty and thankfulneſs to God; For as it is a ſign of Gods grace <hi>to us,</hi> ſo it ſhould be a ſign of Gods grace <hi>in us:</hi> For in the very ſignification of a Sacrament there is a <hi>mutual reſpect;</hi> one on Gods part offering grace, another on mans part promiſing obedience; If either of theſe be wanting, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rite may be a <hi>myſterie,</hi> but it cannot be a <hi>Sacrament</hi> properly ſo called, ſince a Sacrament is the ſeal of a Covenant, and a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is a mutual engagement of two parties, which in this caſe, are God and Man.</p>
                           <p>Therefore a Sacrament is from the very end of its inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, perpetual in its continuance, and common in its uſe; <hi>Perpetual in its continuance,</hi> becauſe Gods Covenant is not for a day but for ever, tis an everlaſting Covenant; And <hi>common in its uſe,</hi> becauſe Gods Covenant is not for one, but for all; tis a general, an univerſal Covenant: <hi>Non enim prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unius ſeculi homines venit Chriſtus, ſed propter omnes

                           <p>Now as concerning the adminiſtration of theſe Sacraments, there is little or no contention about Baptiſm, though now it be commonly adminiſtred by <hi>aſperſion,</hi> whereas heretofore not only in hotter, but alſo in theſe our colder climates it was adminiſtred altogether by <hi>immerſion;</hi> For all do allow that Axiome, <hi>Magis &amp; minus non variat ſpeciem;</hi> ſo as the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be water, tis not material to Baptiſm, whether it be more or leſs; for the leaſt drop of Chriſts blood (ſignified by the water in Baptiſm, and applied to the ſoul) is able to waſh and cleanſe it from all ſin: But there are many and great contentions about the adminiſtration of the Holy Euchariſt; whereby men may have made that a <hi>Diviſion,</hi> which God made a <hi>Communion:</hi> One main reaſon hath been, that ſome would not regard Chriſts <hi>Command,</hi> (hence the wine came to be left out) and yet would obſerve his <hi>practice:</hi> Hence water came to be
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:114933:364"/>
taken in; and hence alſo that ſharp diſpute betwixt the Greek and Latine Church, the one rejecting the uſe of <hi>unleavened,</hi> the other of <hi>leavened</hi> bread: whereas it ought to be without all queſtion, That what was of Chriſts <hi>command</hi> in this Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, is ſtill indiſpenſable; not ſo what was only of his <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe or example;</hi> So ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, I have received of the Lord that which I alſo delivered to you,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23.) bringing them back to Chriſts <hi>command,</hi> to have the ſame elements of bread and wine as he appointed, and to uſe them for the ſame <hi>end,</hi> even for his remembrance: But he brings them not back to Chriſts <hi>example,</hi> to have either unleavened bread, or water mixed with their wine, and much leſs to uſe the ſame poſture he did, that they may receive <hi>ſitting</hi> or <hi>leaning,</hi> or to obſerve the ſame time he did, that they may receive <hi>after Supper;</hi> He leaves all theſe, and the like, as things indifferent, to the diſpoſal of the Church; for they are indifferent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> though they may be <hi>neceſſary</hi> in regard of <hi>us, viz.</hi> when they are commanded, becauſe we are bound to follow the Churches order in things indifferent, to preſerve <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Communion,</hi> as the Church is bound to follow Chriſts order in things neceſſary, to preſerve <hi>the Verity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> And if we deſire to know what is to be judged <hi>neceſſary,</hi> what <hi>indifferent</hi> in regard of this Sacrament, ſince both were joyned together in our Saviours practice; I anſwer, that muſt be accounted <hi>neceſſary</hi> which was <hi>ſubſtantial,</hi> either as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>eſſence</hi> or to the <hi>end</hi> of the Sacrament: That muſt be accounted <hi>indifferent</hi> which was <hi>circumſtantial,</hi> as belonging to the Sacrament only <hi>at that time, ſc.</hi> of the Jewiſh Paſſ over, when the Jews were bound to eat unleavened bread, or <hi>in that country,</hi> as the mingling water with wine, which was uſual in thoſe hotter climates; But the not uſing wine in the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; cannot be accounted Indifferent, becauſe wine is one of the material parts belonging to the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and there can be no whole Communion without it, as there can be no whole being of any thing without one of its eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Parts; Beſides, as The uſing wine belongs to the <hi>eſſence,</hi> ſo likewiſe it belongs to the <hi>end</hi> of this holy Sacrament, which is the <hi>remembrance</hi> of Chriſt: For ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, As often as ye eat this bread, And</hi> (he ſaith not, Or) <hi>drink this cup, ye do
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:114933:364"/>
ſhew the Lords death till he come, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 26. The conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on copulative [<hi>And</hi>] will not allow the propoſition, being <hi>copulative,</hi> to be true, unleſs both its parts be true; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot ſhew the Lords death <hi>only by eating</hi> this bread, unleſs we <hi>alſo drink</hi> this cup; for if we have but <hi>a half Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> we can have but <hi>a half remembrance</hi> of Chriſt: In Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, though our fore-fathers uſed <hi>immerſion,</hi> we now only uſe <hi>aſperſion,</hi> yet both they and we have the <hi>ſame Sacrament,</hi> becauſe both uſe water, and ſo have the ſame <hi>eſſential matter</hi> of Baptiſm, as well as the ſame <hi>eſſential form:</hi> But in the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt it may be doubted whether the preſent Lay-Romaniſts have the ſame Sacrament with their fore-fathers, becauſe they now are not permitted to have the <hi>wine,</hi> which their fore-fathers had, till full a thouſand years after Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>And truly in this reſpect our common people are much more happy then thoſe of the Papacy, That they have the whole Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the bleſſed Euchariſt, and thereby a full remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, and a full Communion <hi>with</hi> him, as well as the Prieſt: For if the blood be with the Body by concomitancy, why ſhould the Prieſt have it twice, who eats of the bread, as well as the Lay-man, and yet beſides drinks of the cup? If the blood be not with the body, it is clear the Lay-man hath it not at all, and ſo he is moſt uncharitably and unjuſtly defrauded of that ſpiritual nouriſhment which Chriſt hath given him. To let alone the Diſpute of Sacriledge in the caſe, for a man to rob God of that ſervice which himſelf hath commanded, or rather the Determination of that Diſpute, for ſo hath Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> determined it in his decretal Epiſtle recited by <hi>Gratian,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Aut integra Sacramenta percipiant, aut ab integris arcean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; Quia diviſio unius ejuſdemque myſterii, ſine grandi Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legio non poteſt provenire. (de conſecr. diſt. 2. cap. 12.) Either let them take all the Sacrament, or let them take none; For what myſterie God hath made One,</hi> man <hi>cannot divide or make Two, without great Sacriledge;</hi> I ſay to let alone the Sacriledge in the caſe, (and yet I cannot ſee how any man can with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience communicate in a Sacriledge) This Uncharitableneſs and Injuſtice is enough to make any conſiderate man out of love with that Church which deals with him ſo uncharitably and ſo unjuſtly: So <hi>unjuſtly</hi> as to deny him what is undoubtedly his
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:114933:365"/>
due: So <hi>uncharitably,</hi> as to deny him what is immortally his comfort, even the conveyance and aſſurance of bleſſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in his ſoul with the eternal Son of God; ſo that if a good <hi>conſcience</hi> move me not for Gods ſake, yet a good <hi>conſideration</hi> will move me for mine own ſake to bleſs God for placing me in ſuch a Church, as gives me a whole &amp; a full communion, becauſe I can aſſure my ſelf, that receiving a whole communions as my Saviour hath appointed, nothing but mine own want of Faith and Repentance can keep me from receiving my Saviour, and with him all the bleſſings and comforts of his Salvation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a man that receives but one Part of this bleſſed Sacrament, cannot be aſſured that he ſhall receive his Saviour with it; for though Chriſt hath graciouſly promiſed that he will be with <hi>his own</hi> inſtitutions, yet he hath abſolutely diſclaimed that he will be with <hi>ours;</hi> concerning theſe he hath plainly ſaid, <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men, Mat.</hi> 15. 8. and much more will it follow from hence, In vain do they worſhip me, doing for duties their own commandments inſtead of mine. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us, that <hi>Johannes Raguſaeus</hi> was eight daies in the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> making an Oration againſt the <hi>Huſſites</hi> concerning the Communion under both kinds: If he had been eight years, it had been to as little purpoſe; for tis not any mans declamation can juſtifie a willful neglect of Chriſts inſtitution; If Chriſt hath commanded this thing, let his command be ſhewed; if not, let not the thing be <hi>attempted,</hi> much leſs <hi>allowed,</hi> ſince he only hath the authority of ordering and inſtituting the ſigns of Grace, who hath the right of promiſing grace, and the power of giving it, when theſe ſigns be uſed according to his order: and he having inſtituted <hi>two</hi> ſigns of grace in this bleſſed Sacrament, if I receive but <hi>one,</hi> by what Faith can I hope for his grace, unleſs I will hope for it without his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> &amp; without his <hi>Power?</hi> So that upon theſe grounds a half Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is no Sacrament; for Chriſt having annexed his Promiſe to his command, If I do not what he hath commanded, How can I expect what he hath promiſed? Therefore ſince my Faith depends wholly upon my Saviours promiſe, not; at all upon his Churches power, I can have no Faith <hi>in,</hi> becauſe he hath made no promiſe <hi>to</hi> a half Sacrament; and yet withall I cannot ſee but the Church may as well Baptize without naming the firſt
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:114933:365"/>
and third perſons of the Trinity, from thoſe Texts which ſpeak of <hi>Baptizing in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> as adminiſter the holy Communion without the cup, from thoſe Texts which ſpeak of <hi>breaking bread;</hi> For ſure the Churches power is as great in the one Sacrament, as it is in the other, and ſo in a ſhort time we may by the Churches power, come to have no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And it is worth our enquiry, whether or no he be not a <hi>Sacramentarian,</hi> who believes the Sacrament to be without the ſigns, as well as he who believes the ſigns to be without the Grace or the thing ſignified.</p>
                           <p>The laſt thing I am to conſider about the Sacraments as they are in our Church, is, the manner of Adminiſtring; And I am not afraid to averr, That as ſhe hath outgone the Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>I had little Reaſon, and ſhould have leſs Religion to be true to my <hi>Church,</hi> if my Church were not true to my <hi>Saviour,</hi> the eternal Truth: Therefore I muſt needs acquit my Church from <hi>Hereſie,</hi> that I may keep my ſelf from <hi>Apoſtaſie;</hi> For if ſhe hath fallen away from Chriſt, I might lawfully fall away from her; at leaſt <hi>internally</hi> by with-drawing my affection, which ought to be fixed upon Gods Truth, if not <hi>externally,</hi> by with-drawing my perſon, which ought not to diſturb the Churches Peace. Let me ſee then how my Church hath kept Gods Truth, that I may learn how to keep my Church: And herein I cannot but perſwade my ſelf, that what our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour once ſpake to thoſe Jews which <hi>believed</hi> on him, he ſtill ſpeaketh to us Chriſtians who profeſs the ſame <hi>belief, If ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

in my word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed; And ye ſhall know the Truth, and the Truth ſhall make you free, John</hi> 8. 31, 32. And by the rule of contraries, If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue not in his word, then are we not his Diſciples in deed, but only in ſhew, and we ſhall not know the Truth, and the Truth ſhall not make us free: Therefore no Church can boaſt of being his <hi>Diſciple,</hi> which doth not continue in his <hi>Word,</hi> that ſhe may continue in his Truth: And in this reſpect I cannot but continue in my Church, that I may continue both in his Word and in his Truth, becauſe I ſee ſhe hath continued in both; ſo that the Truth which hath made her <hi>free,</hi> hath made me a <hi>bondman;</hi> for I am not free to go from the Church, whiles ſhe is free by coming <hi>to,</hi> and abiding <hi>in</hi> the Truth; I muſt be contented to loſe my <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that I may keep my <hi>Piety,</hi> wherein though I have a <hi>ſeeming</hi> loſs, yet I have a <hi>real</hi> gain, even the gain of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which is great gain in this world by <hi>ſanctifying</hi> the ſoul, but greater in the next by <hi>ſaving</hi> it: And this is according to our bleſſed Saviours Prayer, <hi>Sanctifie them through thy Truth, thy word is Truth, John</hi> 17. 17. The ſame is the <hi>Holy</hi> Religion to ſanctifie us, which is the <hi>True</hi> Religion to ſave us; The ſanctification it hath from Gods Truth, the Truth it hath from Gods Word; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Religion that is not built upon Gods Word, can neither have Sanctification, nor Truth; This is the only certain and infallible foundation of the Catholick Faith, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, Ye are of the houſhold of God, and are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner-ſtone,</hi> Eph. 2. 19, 20. <hi>

I made this digreſſion only to ſhew, That unleſs the Holy Scriptures be taken for the foundation of our faith, we are like to have none; For a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is not this foundation, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> The Pope is not ſay theſe two Councils, and the Pope himſelf ſwears on their ſide; So <hi>Bellarmine</hi> defines againſt the Councils, the Councils define againſt the Pope, and the Pope not only <hi>defines,</hi> but alſo <hi>ſwears</hi> againſt himſelf: And we conceive that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> defined againſt them all, when he ſaid, <hi>He that glorieth, let him glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Lord, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 31. and again, <hi>That your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 5. Tis only Gods truth which can be the foundation of our faith: whether propounded by the Scriptures or by the Church: as ſaith <hi>Aquinas, Formale objectum Fidei eſt veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas prima, ſecundum quod manifeſtatur in Scripturis ſacris &amp; Doctrina Eccleſiae, quae procedit ex veritate prima; The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal object of faith is the firſt truth, according as it is manifeſted in the holy Scriptures, and in the doctrine of the Church, which proceedeth from the firſt truth:</hi> He is willing to take in the <hi>Church,</hi> but he is not willing to leave out the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nay indeed he preferreth the <hi>Scriptures</hi> above the <hi>Church,</hi> in the manifeſtation of Gods truth, when he ſaith, <hi>Doctrina Eccleſiae quae procedit ex veritate prima in Scripturis ſacris manifeſtata; (22ae. qu. 5. art. 3. c.) The Doctrine of the Church which proceedeth from the firſt truth manifeſted in the holy Scriptures.</hi> So that according to <hi>Aquinas</hi> Gods truth firſt cometh to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> &amp; from them to the <hi>Church;</hi> That truth the Scriptures propound to the Church by way of <hi>definition;</hi> That ſame truth the Church propoundeth to us by way of <hi>declaration:</hi> Shall we think the declaration may overthrow the definition of truth, or the Church may overthrow the Scripture? This were in effect to allow that we <hi>as Chriſtians,</hi> do <hi>glory</hi> in men more then in God, and that our faith in Chriſt doth more ſtand in
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:114933:371"/>
the wiſdom of man, then in the power of God; Such a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith as this, which relyes upon man, is laid upon the ſand, or upon graſs; <hi>For all fleſh is graſs;</hi> But the foundation of faith which relyes upon the Scriptures, is laid upon a Rock; <hi>The word of the Lord endureth for ever, and this is the word, which by the Goſpel is preached unto you, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 24, 25. This foundation which is laid upon Gods word, is as firm and as infallible as God himſelf, <hi>for all Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, (2. Tim.</hi> 3. 16.) And this is the foundation of our faith, not as <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but as <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> we <hi>vindicate</hi> it as Proteſtants, but we <hi>hold</hi> it as Chriſtians; For no Chriſtian Church or Council did lay any other foundation of faith, before that unhappy Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which began not till the year of our Lord 1545. and ended not till the year 1563. All the cavils that have been raiſed againſt the holy Scriptures, have been raiſed ſince that time, to the great <hi>diſhonour</hi> of Chriſt, the great <hi>diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance</hi> of Chriſtendom, the great <hi>diſcontent</hi> of good Chriſtians, &amp; the great <hi>diſadvantage</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith: For the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot poſſibly give that firmneſs to the building, which is not in it ſelf: therefore there cannot be a greater diſadvantage to the Chriſtian Faith, then to ground it upon an <hi>infirm</hi> and an <hi>unſure</hi> foundation: And ſuch a foundation is the word of man, inſtead of the word of God: For he that believeth the moſt Divine truths only upon humane authority, can have but an humane, an infirm, an uncertain Faith: Therefore Divine truths muſt be believed upon Divine authority, that we may have a Divine faith concerning them: For tis abſurd in <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> impious in <hi>Religion,</hi> to have but a <hi>humane</hi> faith of <hi>Divine</hi> Truths: becauſe the <hi>habit</hi> and <hi>act</hi> are infinitely unproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the <hi>Object:</hi> For there may be a twofold errour in our faith; the one <hi>materially,</hi> when we believe what God hath not revealed, And ſo they only are erroneous in the faith, who believe falſities or uncertainties: The other <hi>formally,</hi> when we believe what God hath revealed, but not upon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his revelation, and ſo they alſo may be erroneous in the faith, who believe the moſt ſure and certain Truths: The ready way to avoid both theſe errors, is, to take the written word of God for the foundation of our faith: wherein we are ſure to meet with Gods <hi>truth or verity</hi> for the matter of our

belief, and with Gods <hi>Authority or Teſtimony</hi> for the cauſe of our believing: And ſince our Church teacheth this and no other faith, no man can ſay ſhe is guilty of Hereſie, that will not make himſelf guilty of Blaſphemy.</p>
                           <p>For the Communion of our Church is free from Hereſie, not only <hi>Materially,</hi> in that ſhe believes no untruths or uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but alſo <hi>Formally,</hi> in that ſhe believeth Gods truths upon Gods own authority: So that to call ſuch a faith Hereſie, which is wholly of God, and through God, muſt needs be blaſphemy: For my part, I confeſs that I do not ſee how I can be ſufficiently thankful to God for making me a member of ſuch a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore am ſure I cannot be too zealous <hi>for it,</hi> nor too conſtant <hi>in it;</hi> A Communion which neither hath Hereſie in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of faith, nor the cauſe of Hereſie in the <hi>foundation</hi> of faith: And truly to be rid of Hereſie, in its <hi>ſelf</hi> and in <hi>its cauſe,</hi> are both very great bleſſing; but yet the latter is the greater of the two: For a true reaſon of believing, which rids us from He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie in its cauſe, may partly excuſe even a falſity in the belief, when a man believes what is not true, becauſe he thinks God hath revealed it; But a falſe reaſon of believing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can ſcarce juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a truth in the belief, when a man believes what is true, but not upon the authority of Gods revelation; The one deſires to be <hi>a true believer</hi> in a falſe article, the other reſolves to be a <hi>falſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi> in a true article of faith: The one in the <hi>cauſe</hi> of his faith believes the truth, whilſt in the <hi>doctrine</hi> of it, he believes an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; the other in the <hi>cauſe</hi> of his faith believes an errour, (for every man is a lyar, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may ſuggeſt a lye) whilſt in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it, he believes a truth; the one in the uprightneſs of his heart cleaves to God, when in his mouth he departs from him; the other in the perverſneſs of his heart departs from God, when in his lips he draws neer unto him: The uprightneſs of heart makes the one a <hi>true</hi> man in his <hi>errour,</hi> as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his falſe Tenent of rebaptiz ation; the perverſneſs of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heart makes the other a <hi>falſe</hi> man in his <hi>truth;</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in any true doctrine which he maintained, after he attributed more to <hi>Montanus</hi> then to the Holy Ghoſt: A faith which is <hi>unſound</hi> in its <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but ſound in its foundation, is ſo <hi>explicitely</hi> falſe in its <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> as that tis <hi>implicitely</hi> true in its <hi>affection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Spirit;</hi> The meaning of the Martyr is this, That they worſhipped God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; only he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Son more at large, as one who had revealed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, and made known the Hoaſt of Angels amongſt other his Revelations; but the Jeſuite by a comma parting the Hoaſt of Angels, from the things revealed, reckons them up as things worſhipped, which comma we may not allow, (though it be now in the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition.) Firſt becauſe it is abſolutely againſt the fore-cited place, which ſaith, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt was worſhipped in the third place, viz.</hi> with the Father and the Son, whereas if the Angels may ſtep in before him, he muſt be contented with the fourth place. Secondly, Becauſe it is an Article of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, that <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in Trinity, and Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is to be worſhipped:</hi> but if the Angels may ſtep in before the Holy Ghoſt, we muſt ſay, not <hi>the Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, but</hi> the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in Community</hi> is to be worſhipped. Thirdly, Becauſe this expoſition ſuppoſeth the bleſſed Martyr to prefer the Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if not above God the Holy Ghoſt, which were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge him out of the Catalogue of the Fathers, and leave him among the groſſeſt Hereticks; whereas on the contrary, he is ſo far from aſſerting the worſhip of Angels, That in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue with <hi>Trypho</hi> the Jew, <hi>He proves the Angel which appeared to</hi> Lot <hi>was indeed the Son of God, becauſe</hi> Lot <hi>worſhipped him;</hi> which proof had been nothing worth, had he thought it lawful to worſhip Angels. 4. Becauſe the Greek Text will not bear this comma, without ſome confuſion in the <hi>words,</hi> and more in the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> which the Latine interpreter well obſerving, hath thus rendred the place, <hi>Verum hunc ipſum (ſo Deum Patrem) &amp; qui ab eo venit, atque iſte nos &amp; bonorum Angelorum exercitum docuit, Filium &amp; Spiritum Propheticum colimus &amp; adoramus.</hi> Fifthly, If the comma ſhould be allowed, yet would it not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie <hi>Bellarmines</hi> concluſion, for he maketh this Inference from it, <hi>That ſome kind of worſhip greater then Civil, leſs then Divine, is due to Angels;</hi> whereas if they be indeed to be worſhipped by vertue of this quotation, They have equal worſhip with God the Father and the Son, and they muſt have it before God the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                           <p>I will not here inſiſt upon arguments from the <hi>uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of this worſhip, becauſe I meet with too too many from

                           <p>IT having been declared that the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is founded in the Truth of Religion, It cannot be reaſonably denyed but that even her <hi>enemies</hi> are bound to her <hi>internal,</hi> and much more her <hi>ſons</hi> are bound to her <hi>external</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: And that both are alſo <hi>bound in conſcience,</hi> becauſe Religion will not be contented with a leſſer obligation: The Doctrine being from God which we <hi>profeſs,</hi> and the Devotion being from God which we <hi>practiſe;</hi> All Chriſtians that live at never ſo great a diſtance from us, are bound to believe our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and to love our Devotion, and thats enough to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute an internal Communion; But thoſe Chriſtians who live amongſt us, are alſo bound to profeſs our Doctrine, and to practiſe our Devotion, and conſequently are not only obliged to our <hi>internal,</hi> but alſo to our <hi>external</hi> Communion: And this obligation is ſo great as to <hi>reach</hi> the very Conſcience, and ſo ſtrong as to <hi>bind</hi> it; For where Religion binds the conſcience by vertue of the three firſt Commandments, there Communion muſt needs bind the Conſcience by vertue of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; that not only every man in <hi>private,</hi> but alſo all men in <hi>publick</hi> may glorifie God in <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> and <hi>Works;</hi> This being the undoubted <hi>End</hi> for which God inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Sabbath, and therefore the undoubted <hi>Duty</hi> which belongs to its inſtitution. And this would God have the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his people know and practiſe, and accordingly put the <hi>Pſalms</hi> concerning it into an Alphabetical method, that they might be the more diligently obſerved, and the more eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by all the Jews: as for example, the 111. <hi>Pſalm</hi> is written Alphabetically, the whole argument whereof is nothing elſe, but the Praiſe of God for his works of Creation, Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Redemption, and teacheth us to praiſe him not only pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately

                              <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hillah, Laus,</hi> becauſe it is nothing elſe but the praiſe of God: whence the Jews called him a <hi>ſon of the world to come,</hi> who did every day ſay this Pſalm not only with his mouth, but alſo with his heart; And this Pſalm is not contented with private praiſes, <hi>I will magnifie thee O God my King, and I will praiſe thy name for ever and ever, ver.</hi> 1. but requireth alſo publick praiſes, <hi>ſo that men ſhall ſpeak of the might of thy marvellous acts, ver.</hi> 6. and <hi>all thy works praiſe thee O Lord, and thy Saints give thanks unto thee, ver.</hi> 10. The private praiſe is according to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Religion in the three firſt; the publick praiſe is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the duty of Communion in the fourth Commandment. Wherefore ſince the fourth Commandment preſuppoſeth the three former in its <hi>obſervation,</hi> it can do no leſs then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe them alſo in its <hi>obligation,</hi> ſo that a true and right pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip of Almighty God obligeth all to come who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it, by no leſs then four of Gods own Commandments; and we may be ſure that our bleſſed Saviour who will condemn us at the laſt day or our wilfull omiſſions of any one Commandment belonging to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> will much more condemn us for our wilful omiſſions of all the Commandments belonging to the <hi>Firſt</hi> Table: If he will ſay, <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye gave me no <hi>meat,</hi> ye gave me no <hi>drink,</hi> then much more becauſe ye gave me no <hi>honour,</hi> ye gave me no <hi>praiſe:</hi> If becauſe ye took me not into your <hi>houſes,</hi> then much more becauſe ye took me not into your <hi>hearts;</hi> If becauſe ye <hi>cloathed</hi> me not, then much more becauſe ye <hi>glorified</hi> me not; If becauſe ye vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited me not in the <hi>priſon,</hi> then much more becauſe ye viſited me not in the <hi>Temple;</hi> Thus we have as much obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſcience as can be from the firſt Table of the Decalogue, to keep Communion with our Church in the publick worſhip of God, becauſe ſhe inviteth us to nothing but what is our indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable and indiſpenſable duty towards God, even to profeſs
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:114933:379"/>
our belief <hi>in</hi> him, our fear <hi>of</hi> him, our love <hi>to</hi> him, with all our heart, with all our mind, and with all our ſoul, and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice what we profeſs by giving him thanks, by calling upon him, by honouring his holy Name and his Word, and by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him truly all the days of our life; And we have alſo as much obligation upon the conſcience as well can be from the ſecond Table of the Decalogue, to keep Communion with our Church in the ſame publick worſhip of Almighty God: I ſpeak of ſuch obligations as ariſe from the order and relation of man to his neighbour, which all flow from the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby every man is obliged to ſubmit himſelf to thoſe ſpiritual, Paſtors and Guides which God hath ſet over him, and much more when they all agree in one, which we call the authority of this our Church: Then <hi>Obedite praepoſitis veſtris, Obey them that have the guide or rule you, and ſubmit your ſelves, (Heb.</hi> 13. 17.) obligeth moſt certainly to an <hi>undeniable;</hi> and were not this age given to queſtion every thing but its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, I would alſo have ſaid to an unqueſtionable obedience. And this obligation which binds us to our ſpiritual Paſtors and Guides, hath not loſt its force and vertue, though we may think we have loſt our Church; Firſt becauſe of the <hi>authority</hi> which the Church hath to bind us; ſecondly becauſe of the <hi>duty</hi> to which we are bound. Firſt, becauſe of the <hi>authority</hi> which the Church hath to bind us, ſince God hath committed us to her charge; For Chriſt taught as one having authority, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 29.

Tis not matter of <hi>cuſtome</hi> or of <hi>conveniency,</hi> that the Church doth teach, and we do learn, but matter of <hi>command</hi> and of <hi>conſcience;</hi> Therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus, Theſe things ſpeak; and exhort, and rebuke with all authority, Tit. 2. 15. <gap reason="foreign">

as one whoſe ſins are bound and retained in heaven, though poſſibly not ſo much as taken notice of here on Earth; And therefore I have great reaſon to fear, that ſentence which a Biſhop of this Church hath recorded upon this very Text, though now I ſee no viſible Judge to pronounce it, <hi>In nomine Dei, &amp;c. In the name of the living God and of Jeſus Chriſt before whom I ſtand, and before whom all fleſh ſhall appear, by the authority of his word, and by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, I divide thee from the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, and declare that thou art no more a member of the body of Chriſt: Thy name is put out of the book of life; Thou haſt no part in the life to come; thou art not in Chriſt, and Chriſt is departed from thee; I deliver thee to Satan the Prince of darkneſs, thy reward ſhall be in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone; Thou ſhalt ſtarve and wither and not abide; The Grace of God is taken out of thy Heart; The face of the Lord is againſt all them that do evil, they ſhall not taſte of his mercy:</hi> (Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> in his Commentary, on 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.) This is a ſentence that I have reaſon to fear, if I be diſobedient to the Doctrine, and bid defiance to the worſhip of Almighty God, which I have learned in this Church. For rather then the Synagogue of Satan ſhall be confounded with the Church of God, Chriſt himſelf will re-aſſume that Power, which he hath given to his Miniſters; he will become the judge, rather then obſtinate ſinners ſhall want the ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: Nay it is to be feared that he is become the Judge already, and hath moreover ratified his own ſentence; for ſurely <hi>men are divided from the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, Chriſt is departed from them, and the grace of God is taken out of their hearts,</hi> when they altogether delight in diviſions, and are <hi>as children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> nay, carried away with <hi>all deceivableneſs of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſneſs, becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved;</hi> And indeed men are firſt generally carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away by the <hi>deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and after that by the <hi>deceivableneſs of untruth;</hi> The deceivableneſs of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs will not let them receive the <hi>love</hi> of the truth, and then the deceivableneſs of untruth will not let them retein the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of it; as it follows, <hi>For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lye, that they all might

O the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mercy of God who hath given us this warning, <hi>to day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts;</hi> O the imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Juſtice of God, who hath given us this doom, that if we hear not his voice to day, we ſhall harden our hearts to morrow: Let us conſider how the Primitive Chriſtians obeyed their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual guides, and we ſhall never want the <hi>Method,</hi> and much leſs loſe the <hi>zeal</hi> of our obedience; We will never let it be ſaid that we have lived ſo many years to <hi>underſtand</hi> our Religion, &amp; now mean to live the reſt of our dayes to <hi>abandon</hi> it, alwayes remembring that heavenly contemplation of the Angelical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, <hi>Ratio Aeternitatis conſequitur Immutabilitatem, ſicut ratio temporis conſequitur motum; (1 par. qu. 10. art. 2.) Eternity is founded upon unchangeableneſs, as time is founded upon change:</hi> Therefore we cannot lay a greater reproach upon Religion, then to <hi>think</hi> or to <hi>ſhew</hi> it <hi>changeable:</hi> as if it rather belonged to time, then to eternity: Secondly, this obligation which binds us to our ſpiritual Paſtors and Guides, hath not loſt its force of binding us, becauſe of the duty to which we are bound, which is the publick practice of Religion: A duty which we cannot perform without the direction of the Church, (for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, <hi>when we come together, every one will have a Pſalm, a Doctrine, a tongue, a revelation, an interpretation, 1 Cor.</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26.) &amp; yet a duty which we cannot wilfully neglect, without the <hi>danger,</hi> if not the <hi>damnation</hi> of our ſouls: For this comes neer that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſin of <hi>ſpiritual ſlothfulneſs,</hi> which regards not Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, and he that regards not communion with God here, how can he hope for the fruition of God hereafter?

Is it our <hi>miſery</hi> that we cannot be ſufficiently joyful in the Lord, and ſhall it alſo be our <hi>ſin</hi> that we will needs be angry with him? <hi>Triſtitia de bono ſpirituali eſt peccatum prepinquum odio Deo,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> To be ſorry for the overture of any Spiritual Good, is a ſin that comes neer the hatred of God, and therefore to be maliciouſly bent againſt ſuch a good muſt needs be to hate him; This conſideration may ſtop the <hi>mouths,</hi> if not wound the <hi>hearts</hi> of thoſe who make it their work to revile ſuch heavenly prayers as cannot be received with too much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, nor repeated with too much devotion; for this is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle other then to revile God and his Church in one and the ſame breath: to revile God in his Religion, and to revile Gods Church in her communion; Whether a man think himſelf ſo perfect as to need no ſpiritual Guide to take care of him, or think his Church ſo imperfect as to ſeek for his ſpiritual guide from ſome other place, the caſe is all one as to the contempt, though very different as to the cauſe of it; For the Church calling him to the Practice of thoſe duties which are truly Chriſtian, in the name and by the Authority of Chriſt, Tis not his cavilling againſt his <hi>Mother</hi> on earth, can diſpenſe with his Undutifulneſs againſt

                           <p>Secondly, an ereoneous conceit cannot excuſe him in point of Communion; For an erroneous conceit hath much leſs power then an erroneous conſcience, to excuſe him for diſobeying Gods command; and here are no leſs then two of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments that oblige him to the duty of Communion, to wit, The fourth, becauſe the Communion concerns Gods publick worſhip; and the fift, becauſe the publick worſhip is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by publick authority; For the Communion being indeed with the eternal Son of God, (as it muſt be ſince the Religion is truly from him, in all its performances of Invocation, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Adminiſtration) tis not his thinking, or any mans ſaying, <hi>That he may not Communicate with Hereticks or Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> can excuſe him for not communicating with his <hi>Brethren,</hi> and much leſs with his <hi>Saviour,</hi> whoſe Communion is ever to be <hi>deſired</hi> with great earneſtneſs, and never to be <hi>deſerted,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great <hi>ſhame,</hi> and greater <hi>ſin:</hi> According to that excellent exhortation of our Church, <hi>But when you depart, I beſeech you ponder with your ſelves, from whomye depart; ye depart from the Lords Table, ye depart from your Brethren, and from the banquet of moſt heavenly food;</hi> What greater <hi>ſin</hi> then to depart from the Lords heavenly table and food?
