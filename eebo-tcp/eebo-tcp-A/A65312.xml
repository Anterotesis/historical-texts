            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>1. A Kind Compellation, <hi>Brethren.</hi>
The Saints of God are Brethren. They

               <note n="*" place="margin">August.</note>, cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>Then <hi>let there be no strife among them,
seeing they are brethren,</hi> Gen. 13. 8. Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are regenerated by the same <hi>Spirit,</hi>
they suck the same Breasts, the Promises;
they wear the same Garment, <hi>Christs
Righteousness;</hi> they sit at the same Board,
the <hi>Table of the Lord;</hi> they partake of the
same Glory, <hi>the inheritance in light,</hi> Col.
1. 12, and shall they not love! There
ought to be no contending among Gods
people, but who should love most<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 8.</note>.</p>
            <p>Satan leaps at discord, he warms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at the fire of mens Passions. If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
divide the Spiritual members from
their Head, he will endeavour to make
them <hi>smite one against another.</hi> If he cannot
keep the Saints from Heaven, he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make them <hi>fall out by the way.</hi>
It was ill for <hi>Abrahams</hi> Herd-men and <hi>Lots</hi>
to fall out when the <hi>Canaanite</hi> was in the
Land, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 7. 'Tis an ill time for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
to be fighting when the enemy is
boring an hole in the bottom of the Ship.
Take heed the Popish Enemy doth not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56019:4"/>
enter at your breaches. Let Christians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
they are <hi>Brethren.</hi> Unity among
Brethren, resembles the harmony among
Angels. <hi>Psal. 133. 1, 2, Behold how good
and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in unity; it is like the precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the head, as the dew of Hermon.</hi>
'Tis compared to <hi>ointment,</hi> because it is
sweet; and to the <hi>dew of Hermon,</hi> because
it makes every thing fruitful. The Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians were <hi>of one heart,</hi> Act. 4. 32.
Let us pray, That that Golden Motto
may be written upon <hi>England, Cor unum,

love shall be perfect, our joy shall be full!</p>
            <p>2. A Seasonable Admonition, <hi>The time
is short.</hi> This word [<hi>Time</hi>] I shall take
more <hi>strictly</hi> for the term and period of
mans life, <hi>The time is short.</hi> The divers

who roul up their Sails and bring them
into a narrow compass when the Ship
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56019:5"/>
draws near the Harbour. So though the
sails of mans life were spread larger in the
times of the Patriarchs, yet now God is
folding up these sails in a narrower com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
<hi>Tempus contractum est,</hi> the <hi>Time is
short:</hi> the Scripture frequently asserts the
brevity and transitoriness of mans life,
<hi>Psal. 89. 97, Remember how short my time
is</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Quantillum sit tempus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. <hi>Gejer.</hi>
               </note>. Psal. 39. 5, <hi>Behold, thou hast made my
days as an hand-breadth;</hi> which is the
least of the Geometrical measures. <hi>Job</hi>
useth three elegant Metaphors to set forth
the shortness of mans life, <hi>Job 9. 25, My
days are swifter than a Post, they are passed
away as the swift ships, as the eagle that
hasteth to her prey.</hi> If we look to the land,
there mans life is like a swift Post; if we
look to the Sea, there it is like a swift
Ship; if we look to the air, there it is
like a flying eagle.</p>
            <p>Life is compared to a cloud, <hi>Job</hi> 7. 9,
a cloud is a vapour drawn up by the Sun
into the middle-region of the air; when
this cloud comes to its full proportion, it is
soon dispersed and blown away with the
wind. Life gathers as a cloud, bigger and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56019:5"/>
bigger, but on a sudden it is dissipated
by death. Our life is but as a point to the
Globe<note n="*" place="margin">Punctum est quod vivimus &amp; puncto mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. <hi>Sen.</hi>
               </note>, nay it is less, <hi>Psal. 39. 5, My age
is as nothing<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> before thee.</hi> There is but a
span between the Cradle and the Grave.
<hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>There is a time to be born,
and a time to die,</hi> Eccles. 3. 3, but menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
no time of living, as if that were so
short, it were not worth speaking of<note n="*" place="margin">Vita adeò parum a morte distat ut ipsa mors sit. <hi>Musc.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> In what sense is the time of life
short?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is short in respect of the
<hi>uncertainty,</hi> it may instantly expire. A
man that holds a Farm at the will of his
Landlord, if he be asked how long time
he hath in the Farm, he will say, no time
at all, because he is sure of none, he may
be turned out the next hour. So our time
is short because uncertain. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> it is
true, had a lease of fifteen years sealed,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 5, but we have no such lease seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us, death may be within a days march
of us.</p>
            <p>Quis scit an adjiciant hodiernae crastina
vitae tempora, dii superi<note n="*" place="margin">Horat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>There are so many casualities, that it is a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56019:6"/>
wonder if the slender thread of our Life
be not cut off by untimely Death. Have
you not seen a Virgin on the same day
dressed in her Bride-apparel, and her
Winding-sheet.</p>
            <p>2. Time is short in respect of the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</hi>
If we reckon that for Time
which is <hi>well spent,</hi> then Time is brought
into a narrow compass indeed: a great
part of our Time lies Fallow: take from
our life all the time of Eating, Drinking,
Sleeping, besides idle impertinencies,
and then how short is out Time! How
little is the time wherein we can truly
say, <hi>Hoc Vixi, This time I have lived!</hi>
O how little is the time which is spent
with God! Time misimployed, is not
Time <hi>lived,</hi> but Time <hi>lost</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Diu suit in mundo non vixit. <hi>Sen.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>3. Time is short compared with Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
There is no Prospective-glass to see
to the end of Eternity. Eternity is a Day
that hath no Sun-setting<note n="*" place="margin">Una dies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinua occajum non habens. <hi>Gerh.</hi>
               </note>. It is a Circle
without beginning or end. Eternity is a
sum that can never be numbred, a Line that
can never be measured: reckon as many
millions of years as there have been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56019:6"/>
since the Creation, and they stand
for Ciphers in Eternity. The most ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
strains of Rhetorique cannot
reach Eternity<note n="*" place="margin">Cogita cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum millia an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum, cogita decies Centena millia annorum, Cogita mille milliones anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, immò sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culorum non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum in choasti aeternum. <hi>Corn. à Lap.</hi>
               </note>: It is a Sea without
Bottom and Banks. Time may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to a spot of Earth lying at the
mouth of the great Ocean; Time is a
<hi>Spot</hi> on this side Eternity; and what a
little of that Spot is Mans life! Thus you
see in what sense Time is short.</p>
            <p>It will not be long before <hi>the Silver
cord be loosed, and the Golden bowl bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi>
Eccles. 12. 6. By the <hi>Silver Cord</hi> I
understand the Pith or Marrow of the
Back, which for its whiteness is called
Silver: this Silver Cord will soon be
loosed. By the <hi>Golden Bowl</hi> is meant
the Meninx, or Skin, wherein the Brains
are enclosed as in a Bowl; this Golden

               <hi>Quest.</hi> What advantage will accrew to
us by often thinking of our short stay
here?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The shortness of Time medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
on, would cool the heat of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to the World. These visible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56019:9"/>
please the fancy, but they do not so
much <hi>delight</hi> us, as <hi>delude</hi> us: they are <hi>brevi

things are like a fair Picture drawn

<hi>The time is short,</hi> why should we love

                  </gap>.</note>,
or Pageant, <hi>of the World passeth away.</hi>
Time passeth away as a Ship in full sail:
this thought-on seriously, would mortify
Covetousness. <hi>Paul</hi> looked upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as ready to loosen Anchor and be
gone, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 14, Knowing that shortly
I must put off this my Tabernacle:</hi> And
how did his love to the World dye? <hi>Gal.
6. 14, The World is Crucified to me, and
I unto the World.</hi> Who would covet that
much, which hath neither <hi>Contentment</hi> nor
<hi>Continuance?</hi> Among the <hi>Graecians,</hi> the
City of <hi>Sparta</hi> had a King of it but for
a year, and then he was to lay down his
Crown, which made every one strive not
to be King. Why should we so toil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the World, as if we were to live here
ever? What needs a long provision for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56019:9"/>
a short way<note n="*" place="margin">Parùm viae quid multum viati<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to bear our charges to Heaven, it sufficeth.
Suppose a mans Lease were ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and he should fall a building and
planting, would not he be judged indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet?
When our time is so very short,
now to follow the World immoderately,
as if we would fetch happiness out of the
Earth, which God hath cursed, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of frenzy: we shall have no need
of the Earth shortly, but to be buried in
it.</p>
            <p>2. The meditation of the shortness of
Time, would be a means to humble us.
St. <hi>Augustin</hi> calls Humility the Mother of
the Graces. Balm sinks to the bottom of the
Water: a good Christian sinks low in
Humility: and what can sooner pull
down the Flags and Banners of Pride, than
to consider we are shortly dropping into
the Dust<note n="*" place="margin">Agnoscat homo se esse mortalem &amp; franget elatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note>. The Priest was to cast the
Feathers of the Fowls, <hi>by the place of the
ashes, Levit.</hi> 1. 16. All your Feathers of
Honour must shortly lye in the ashes. Shall
not he which is cloathed with Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
be cloathed with Humility? The
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56019:10"/>
thoughts of the Grave would bury our
pride. When the Lord had said to the
Judges, <hi>Psal. 82. 6, I said ye are gods;</hi> lest
they should grow proud, he adds a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective,
<hi>but ye shall die like men.</hi> Ye are
<hi>dying-gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The meditation of the shortness of
time, would hasten our Repentance. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is as necessary as Heaven; as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
moisture and natural heat preserve
the life, so repenting-tears, and an heart
burning with love, preserve the soul. It is
natural to delay Repentance<note n="*" place="margin">

<hi>Hag. 1. 2, The time is not yet come.</hi> But
the Text saith, <hi>the time is short;</hi> our life
is a taper, soon blown out. The thoughts
of Times volubility and swiftness, would
keep us from proroguing our repentance.
'Tis no time for us to make a long work,
when God is making a short work<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

observed of the Birds of <hi>Norway,</hi> that they
fly faster than the birds of other Countrys.
By the instinct of nature knowing the days
in that Climate to be very short, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
make the more hast to their nests. The
consideration of our short abode here, will
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56019:10"/>
make us avoid delays, and fly faster to
Heaven upon the wing of repentance.</p>
            <p>4. The meditation of the shortness of
time, would antidote us against the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Satan<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. Temptation is Satans
eldest daughter, that woes for him. Satan
doth more mischief by his <hi>wiles,</hi> than his
<hi>darts.</hi> He knows how to suit his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as the Husbandman knows what
seed is proper for such a soil. Satan temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Achan</hi> with a wedg of Gold; <hi>David</hi>
with Beauty. It is hard to keep up the
banks of Grace against the sea of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I know no better remedy against Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
immodest solicitations, than this Text,
<hi>The time is short:</hi> What Satan, dost thou
tempt me to vanity, when I am going to
give up my accounts? shall I now be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
when to morrow I may be dying?
How shall I look my Judg in the face?
Christian, when Satan sets sinful pleasure
before thee, shew him a <hi>deaths-head,</hi> this
will make temptations vanish.</p>
            <p>5. The consideration of the shortness
of our stay in the world, would be an
help to <hi>Temperance;</hi> it would make us
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56019:11"/>
sober and moderate in the use of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comforts. By excess we turn things
lawful into sin<note n="*" place="margin">In licitis perimus omnes.</note>; the Bee may suck a

upon this, and proceed in your Banket.</hi> An
excellent Antidote against a Surfeit. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
of <hi>Arimathea</hi> erected a Sepulchre in
his Garden, to spice his flowry delights
with the thoughts of death.</p>
            <p>6. The meditation of the shortness of
time, would much mitigate our grief for
the loss of dear Relations. It is observable,
when the Apostle had said, <hi>The time is
short,</hi> he presently adds, <hi>Let them that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56019:11"/>
weep be as if they wept not.</hi> No doubt the
loss of Relations is grievous to the fleshy
part. It is like pulling a limb from the
body. When God strikes us in our <hi>right
eye,</hi> we weep. 'Tis lawful to give vent to
our grief: <hi>Joseph</hi> wept over his dead Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But though Religion doth not <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
grief, it <hi>bounds</hi> it. We must weep
<hi>quasi non, as if we wept not. Rachels</hi> sin
was, that she <hi>refused to be comforted,</hi> Mat.

and if any thing can stop the issue of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
at least asswage it, it is this, <hi>The time
is short.</hi> We shall shortly have our losses
made up, and enjoy our godly Relations
again in Heaven.</p>
            <p>7. The Meditation of the shortness of
time, would make us highly value Grace.
Time is <hi>short,</hi> but Grace is <hi>for ever.</hi> 1 Joh.
2. 27, <hi>The anointing which ye have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of him, abideth in you.</hi> Grace is a blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

<hi>immortal seed,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 9. Grace is <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo
Gloriae;</hi> Grace is not blasted by death,
but transplanted into a better soil. Grace
is not a lease which soon expires, but an
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56019:12"/>
inheritance intailed for ever. He who hath
true Grace, can no more lose it, than the
Angels can who are fixed in their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Orb. <hi>Rev. 10. 6, The Angel sware
by him that liveth for ever, that there should
be time no longer.</hi> But Grace shall survive
time, and run parallel with Eternity.</p>

or to Heaven<note n="*" place="margin">Animula, vagula, blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula, quae nunc abibis in loca? <hi>Hadr.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>2. Improve this short time by laying
hold of all the seasons and opportunities
for your Souls. The Mariner takes the
fit season, he sets to Sea while the wind
blows. <hi>Time is short,</hi> and Opportunity
(which is the Cream of Time) is shorter.
Let not the seasons of mercy slip.</p>
            <p>1. While Gods Spirit strives with you,
cherish its sweet whispers and motions:
as when the Dove came flying to the
windows of the Ark, <hi>Noah</hi> reached out
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56019:14"/>
his hand, and pulled it into the Ark: So
when Gods Spirit (this blessed Dove)
comes to you, entertain and welcom it
into the Ark of your Souls<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 6. 8.</note>. If you
repulse the Spirit, he may refuse to <hi>strive</hi>
any more. Gospel-seasons though they
are sweet, they are swift.</p>
            <p>2. While God's Ministers are with
you, make use of them, <hi>Zechar. 1. 5, The
Prophets, do they live for ever?</hi> Their
Time (by reason of their labours) is scarce
so long as others. We read of <hi>Lamps
within the Pitchers,</hi> Judg. 7. 16. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
are <hi>Lamps;</hi> but these Lamps are
in <hi>Earthen Pitchers,</hi> which soon break.
Ministers, though they carry the Word of
Life in their Mouths, yet they carry
Death in their Faces. Improve their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
while you have them: they thirst
for your happiness, and as so many Bells
would Chime-in your Souls to Christ.</p>
            <p>3. Improve this short time by keeping
up a close Communion with God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
1. 3. <hi>Our</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

the Father, &amp;c.</hi> This sweet Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God is kept up, 1. By holy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56019:15"/>
meditation, <hi>Gen. 24. 63, Isaac went out
to meditate in the Field at even-tide.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
concocts Divine-truths in the
mind. It brings God and the Soul toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="*" place="margin">Nil in hac vita dulcius sentitur, nil ita mortem ab amore mundi s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note>.
It is the bellows of the affections: It
gives a sight and a tast of invisible Glory,
<hi>Psal. 140. 39, My meditation of him shall
be sweet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Communion with God is kept up
by Prayer: Praying-dayes are Ascension<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes.
<hi>Caligula</hi> placed his Effigies in the
Capitol, whispering in <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Ears.
Prayer whispers in Gods Ears: It is a
secret parley and converse with God<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Clem. Alex.</note>. On
this Mount of Prayer the Soul hath many
sweet transfigurations.</p>
            <p>4. Improve this short time by doing
all the service you can for God<note n="*" place="margin">Dio servire est regnare.</note>: Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
may be learned of an Enemy; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
is the more fierce, <hi>because he knoweth
his time is but short,</hi> Rev. 12. 12: we
should act more vigorously for God, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our time is but short. Our lives
should be as jewels, though <hi>little</hi> in <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi>
yet great in <hi>value.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew
his stay in the world was short, 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1, 14,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56019:15"/>
therefore how zealous and active was he
for God while he lived, 1 <hi>Cor, 5. 10. I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, more abundantly than they
all. Paul</hi>'s Obedience did not move slow,
as the Sun on the Dial, but swift, as the
Sun in the Firmament. Is Time short?
Let us be God-exalters, let us bring Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to God in doing good to others: as
Aromatick-trees sweat out their precious
Oyles; so should we lay out our strength
for the good of others.</p>
            <p>1. Let us do good to their <hi>Souls:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the ignorant, strengthen the weak,
reduce the wandring: A good Christian
is both a <hi>Diamond</hi> and a <hi>Load-stone.</hi> A
Diamond sparkling in sanctity, and a
Loadstone for his attractive virtue in
drawing others to Christ.</p>
            <p>2. Let us do good to their Bodies:
Many at this day say to their sorrows,
<hi>Ye are our Companions.</hi> Let our Fingers
drop with the Myrthe of liberality, <hi>Heb.
13. 16, To do good, and communicate, forget
not.</hi> Let us feed the hungry, cloath the
naked; be <hi>Temporal Saviours</hi> to others<note n="*" place="margin">Incipe erogae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re si non vis errare. <hi>Aug. de Verb. Dom.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:56019:16"/>
Could we thus improve our time, our
lives, though <hi>short,</hi> would be <hi>sweet:</hi> this
would be the way to cast abroad a fragrant
redolent smell in Gods Church; like the
Orange-trees which perfume the air where
they grow.</p>
            <p>Could we thus improve our time, we
might have our Consciences drawing up
a Certificate for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12; and
then no matter though the World cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
if Conscience acquit: no matter
how cross the wheels go, if the Clock
strikes right.</p>
            <p>Could we thus improve our time, we
might have an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an easy and joyful
passage out of the world. This was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>'s
comfort when he thought he was
lying on his death-bed, 2 <hi>King. 20. 3, I
beseech thee, O Lord, remember how I have
done that which is good in thy sight.</hi> To
improve Time aright, answers Gods cost,
credits Religion, saves the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Terror to every wicked person,
who exhausts his strength in sin: his time
here is <hi>short,</hi> and then begins his Hell.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56019:16"/>
He spends his life in a frolick; he takes
the <hi>Timbrel and Harp, and rejoyceth at
the sound of the Organ,</hi> Job 21. 12. But
the time is shortly coming, when all his
mirth shall cease, <hi>Rev. 18 22, The voice
of the Harpers, and Musicians, and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters
shall be heard no more at all in thee.</hi>
The Grave buries all a sinners joy. When
a wicked man dies, the Devil gets a wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal.
Satan (in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s shape) said to <hi>Saul,
2 Sam. 28. 19, Thou shalt be with meto mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>
The Sinner is to day with his Lusts,
and may be tomorrow with the Devil. Who
would envy the wicked, their honour,
or pleasure? they must pay dear for it.
They have a short Feast, but a long
Reckoning: for a drop of mirth, they
must drink a Sea of wrath: and <hi>Who
knows the power of that wrath?</hi> It was a
saying of <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine,</hi> If a man
had but a sight of Hell, it were enough
to make an intemperate person sober.
Hell is the emphasis of <hi>Torment.</hi> The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of <hi>Jealousy</hi> was to have <hi>no Oyl,</hi> nor
<hi>Frankincense</hi> put to it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 15. In
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56019:17"/>
Hell is no <hi>Oyl of Mercy</hi> put to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the wicked to lenify them;
nor is there any <hi>Incense</hi> of Prayer to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
Gods wrath. Oh that sinners would
in time break off their iniquities. What
is become of their Intellectuals, have they
sinned away <hi>Reason</hi> as well as <hi>Conscience?</hi>
The time of life is short, but the torments
of Hell are lengthened out; <hi>Rev. 14. 11,
The smoke of their torment ascendeth up for
ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Vse.</hi> Here is a <hi>light side</hi> of the Text,
to the Godly; they may be glad that
their time here is <hi>short;</hi> they cannot live
but by dying. Behold, <hi>honey at the end of
the rod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The time being short, their <hi>sinning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time</hi>
cannot be long. Sin is a troublesome
<hi>inmate.</hi> Rom. 7. 24, <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>Bird of
Paradise,</hi> sighed and groan'd under corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
a child of God mingles sin with his
duties, he cannot write a copy of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
without blotting; there's a party in
a regenerate heart sides with Satan; but
be of good comfort, <hi>the time is short,</hi> it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56019:17"/>
is but a while (Christians) that the <hi>dead
man shall be tyed to the living;</hi> that you
shall be combating with a proud, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
heart. The year of <hi>release</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Death doth to the Godly, as the
Angel did to <hi>Peter</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 12. 7.</note>, it smites them, and
makes their chains of sin fall off
quite.</p>
            <p>2. The time being short, their <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-time</hi>
cannot be long: in this life much
work is cut out. There is, 1. The work of
the <hi>hand,</hi> as the Artificer works in his
Trade, <hi>Prove.</hi> 10. 4. 2. The work of the
<hi>head;</hi> notions are the children of the brain,
and there is labour in bringing them forth.</p>
            <p>3. The work of the <hi>heart,</hi> which is the
hardest work, to <hi>search, cleanse, watch</hi>
the heart; as a clock sometimes goes faster,
sometimes flower; so the heart sometimes
goes faster in sin, sometimes flower in
duty. But here is the Saints comfort, their
working-time is but short, <hi>Rev. 19. 13,
They rest from their labours.</hi> When their
bodies return to dust, their souls return to
rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56019:18"/>
3. Time being short, their <hi>suffering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time</hi>
cannot be long. Life is inter-larded
with trouble, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 1. You may as well
separate <hi>weight</hi> from lead, as trouble from
mans life.<note place="margin">Quid est diù vivere, nisi diu Torqutri? <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> We come into the world with
a <hi>Cry,</hi> and go out with a <hi>Groan.</hi> Every
one hath his yoke, and 'tis well if there
be not a nail in it; but <hi>Time is short.</hi>
Though the Cross be <hi>heavy,</hi> we have but
a little way to carry it; death will give
the godly a <hi>writ of ease,</hi> Job 3. 17, <hi>There
(i.e.</hi> in the Grave) <hi>the wicked cease from
troubling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Time being short,</hi> their waiting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
cannot be long; the Godly shall not
be long out of Heaven. While the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Angels see the orient beauties that
shine in Gods face, Believers live far from
Court, being imprisoned in the body.
Here they do rather <hi>desire</hi> God than <hi>enjoy</hi>
him. But the <hi>Time is short,</hi> it is but a few
days, perhaps hours, and the Saints shall
be ever solacing themselves in the light of
Gods Countenance. They shall leave
their pillow of thorns, and lay their head
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56019:18"/>
on Christs bosom. Faith gives a <hi>propriety</hi>
in God, death gives a <hi>possession.</hi> The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
and Chariots came ratling to old <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
but they were to carry him to his Son
<hi>Joseph.</hi> Deaths Chariot-wheels may come
ratling to a Believer, but it is to
carry him home to his Fathers house.</p>
            <p>In that Paradise of God a Christian shall
have more than he can <hi>think; Eph.</hi> 3. 20. He
can think, What if every mountain were
a Pearl, every flower a Ruby, every sand
in the Sea a Diamond, the whole Globe
a shining Chrysolite? but all his thoughts
are too low and dwarfish to reach the
glory of the Coelestial Pyramides.<note place="margin">Praemium quod side non attin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getur.</note> The
reward Heavenly (as St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
Faith; and the Time being short,
a Christian shall be in Heaven before he is
aware; then shall he bathe his Soul in those
perfum'd pleasures of Paradise, which
<hi>run at Gods right hand for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with the Text: let me
speak next to the Occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56019:19"/>
We are met to commemorate the
Death of an Eminent Minister in this
City, Mr. <hi>JOHN WELLS.</hi> Sorry I
am to be an Actor in this Mournful
Scene. But being requested by Him in
his life (in case I survived), I was
willing to do this last Office of love.
There hath been of late a great mortality
of Ministers. The men of the World
need not be so fierce against Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
they will not trouble them long;
Gods taking away his Ministers so fast
(two in a day) boads much evil. It
presageth the fall of an House when the
Pillars are removed.</p>
            <p>Concerning this Reverend Brother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
it is not my purpose to use any
hyperbolical Encomiums, or Panegyricks;
only give me leave to strow a few Flowers
upon his Hearse.</p>
            <p>This our worthy Friend was endued
with Learning and volubleness of speech.
He could <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>divide the word
rightly, as a workman that need not be
ashamed.</hi> Seals he had to his Ministry.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56019:19"/>
Some of his hearers might call him (as
<hi>Cyprian</hi> did <hi>Caecilius) novae vitae paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi>
their Spiritual Father.</p>
            <p>For his Piety, he was not only a <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower</hi>
of that which was good, but a <hi>leader;</hi>
he said not long before his death, That he
had brought this to an issue, <hi>That he loved
God.</hi> He was fixed to his Principles:
Though he be now by Death a <hi>Fallen-Star,</hi>
yet he was not a <hi>Wandring-Star</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His disposition was not Morose, but Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable:
a man of that Candor and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy,
as did oblige and win the affections
of many to him. When Grace and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Nature meet, it is like a Pearl in
a Gold-Ring.</p>
            <p>For his Preaching, 1. He did frame
himself, <hi>ad captum populi;</hi> he Preached in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly
to the capacity of his Auditory.
Sure that Minister will never hit the
hearts of his hearers, who shoots over their
heads. Ministers should be <hi>Stars</hi> to give
light, not <hi>Clouds</hi> to darken the Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Clearness is the grace of Speech. <hi>Gregory
Nazianzen</hi> Preached plain to the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56019:20"/>
yet was admired by the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>2. He was elaborate and painful in his
work. Sloath in a Minister is as bad as
Sleep in a Sentinel. He would not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that to God which <hi>cost him nothing.</hi>
Christ bled for Souls, well may we
sweat. This good man, like a Taper, wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself, while he gave light to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>He was a man of a forgiving-Spirit;
he was not troubled with the overflowing
of the Gall: Kindnesses he wrote in
Marble; Injuries he forgot.</p>
            <p>He was very Charitable: The Backs
and Bellies of the Poor, were the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
where he sowed the Seeds of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality.
But though his Charity did
shine, he did not care it should
blaze. He is now <hi>taken from the evil to
come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For you that did sit under his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
let me tell You, you have lost a
<hi>Friend</hi> and a <hi>Guide;</hi> you have cause to
be <hi>Close-mourners.</hi> Let me request only
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56019:20"/>
this of you, That you would remember
the many good Instructions given you:
though he is dead, let not his Sermons
dye too, but labour to Copy them out
fair in your Lives.</p>
