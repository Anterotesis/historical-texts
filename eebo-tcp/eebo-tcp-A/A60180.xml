         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE WORK Deſigned, OR THE SCOTISH ATLAS To be Publiſhed.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt the many Sciences, which perfite and adorn the mind of man, <hi>Geography</hi> is worthy of all praiſe: becauſe it both affordeth matter of much delight, and likewiſe is of much uſe for the life of man. This World being a Theater, whereupon each act their Part, and by the ſeveral Perſonages, which they repreſent, very much demonſtrate the marvellous Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs of GOD, who hath contrived all for the perfection of the Univerſe his great Work, and by his never erring Providence bringeth all about to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his good will and pleaſure: Man, who is the leſſer World and Abridgement of the Greater, cannot but find the advantages of <hi>Geography,</hi> by which we ſee all the parts of this great Machine, even which are moſt remote from us, and look upon theſe who are abſent, as if they were preſent with us. What delight muſt it give us, when we learn by it the Situation of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, Towns and Rivers, as well as if we had viewed them with our eyes! It is certain that moſt of men have a great deſire to travell, and it is certainly an inexcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fault to be ignorant of what concerneth our own Countrey: Yet many, becauſe of their poverty or want of health, are deprived of theſe Advantages. And therefore we are much beholden to <hi>Geography,</hi> by which all the face of the World is expoſed to us, and we can even ſitting at home view the whole Earth and Seas, and much ſooner paſs through them in our ſtudies, than Travellers can do by their Voyages; and ſo may, without the hazard of being infected by the vices of Forreiners, improve our minds and reap all other Advantages from them. Not to mention here, how the Policy of each place, the ſtudies of <hi>Theology,</hi> of <hi>Natural Philoſophy, Hiſtory</hi> and ſeveral Arts may be improved by this knowledge. I ſhall only inſtance in <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſing, Navigation</hi> and the Pactice of <hi>Medicine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for <hi>Merchandiſing,</hi> (which with <hi>Navigation</hi> is the great ſupport of corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) it can hardly be entertained without the knowledge of the Countreys and their Products, of the nature and manners of the Inhabitants and Rodes that lead to them, which the Maps and deſcriptions joyned to them inform us of; and by the Maps the Mariners come to know the ſituation of the Countreys they intend for, the Rout they are to follow and the Dangers they are to be aware of.</p>
            <p>As for the Practice of <hi>Medicine, Hippocrates</hi> hath abundantly proven, that a  Phyſician, who would practiſe aright, muſt firſt know the place.<note place="margin">Lib. de Aë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, Aquis &amp; Locis.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſidering theſe great uſes of <hi>Geographical</hi> Deſcriptions, many complained that there was ſo little done, as to the Deſcription of our Countrey: For the <hi>Theater</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> publiſhed by <hi>Bleau,</hi> for all its Bulk (except it be the Deſcription of ſome few ſhires by the learned <hi>Gordon</hi> of <hi>Straloch,</hi> and ſome ſheets of his of the <hi>Scotia</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97663:3"/>
               <hi>Antiqua</hi>) containeth little more than what <hi>Buchanan</hi> wrote, and ſome few Scrapes out of <hi>Cambden,</hi> who is no friend to us in what he writeth. And in reſpect that there are many Iſlands around this Ancient Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and many impetuous and contrary Currents and Tides, and in ſeveral places the Coaſt is full of Rocks, or Banks of ſand, which ought to be exactly deſcribed for the ſecurity of Trade. And becauſe the face of the Country, by the peace and quiet we enjoy under his <hi>Majeſtie's</hi> happy Government, is quite changed from what it was of old; and now for Stately Buildings, Parks, fertile Fields, we begin to contend with the happieſt of our Neighbours: therefore a new and full deſcription was much deſired by all ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons.</p>
            <p>For theſe conſiderations His <hi>Sacred Majesty,</hi> the Father of his Countrey, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and wiſe proviſor of all that may be for the profite and honour of it, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and ordained, by His Letters patent under the Seal, Sir Robert <hi>Sibbald</hi> one of His Phiſicians in ordinary and His <hi>Geographer</hi> for His Ancient Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to publiſh an exact deſcription of <hi>Scotland Ancient and Modern,</hi> with the Maps. And, that the Maps may be exact and juſt, the Lords of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Council in <hi>Scotland</hi> gave Commiſſion to <hi>John Adair</hi> Mathematician and skilfull Mechanick, to ſurvey the Shires. And the ſaid <hi>John Adair,</hi> by taking the diſtances of the ſeveral Angles from the adjacent Hills, hath deſigned moſt exact Maps, and hath lately made an <hi>Hydrographical</hi> Map of the River of <hi>Forth</hi> Geometrically ſurveyed, Wherein, after a new and exact way, are ſet down all the Iſles, blind Rocks, Shelves and Sands, with an exact Draught of the Coaſts, with all its Bayes, Head lands, Ports, Havens, Towns, and other things remarkeable; the Depths of the Watters through the whole <hi>Firth,</hi> with the Courſes from each Point, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and view of the remarkable Iſlands, Head-lands, and other conſiderable land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks. And he is next to ſurvey the Shire of <hi>Perth,</hi> and to make two Maps there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, one of the ſouth-ſide, and another of the North. He will likewiſe be ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the maps of the other Shires, that were not done before, providing he may have ſufficient allowance therefore. And, that theſe, who are concerned, may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perſwaded thereto, there is joyned with this Account the Map of <hi>Clackmanan-Shire</hi> taken off the Copper-Plate done for it, where may be ſeen not only the Towns, Hills, Rivers and Lochs; but alſo the different face of the grounds, which are Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and which Mooriſh: and by convenient Marks you may know the Houſes of the Nobility and Gentry, the Churches, Mills, woods and Parks &amp;c,</p>
            <p>In obedience to His <hi>Majeſties</hi> command, the ſaid Sir Robert <hi>Sibbald</hi> printed <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> for obtaining the Information that was neceſſary for the Deſcription of each Shire; and hath been at the pains to collect ſeveral Manuſcripts Ancient and Modern, which may illuſtrate the ſaid work; and hath recovered ſeveral Ancient Inſcriptions, which were never publiſhed before; and hath now made that advance in the work, that if the reſt of the Informations from the Shires be ſent in ſhortly, and theſe few Shires be deſigned, which are not yet done, this Deſcription in <hi>Engliſh</hi> (whereof this is the Account) may be very ſoon ready for the Preſs. For the further encouragement of theſe, who may be Subſcribers for the Copies, it is fit there be ſome Account of it given, which is as followeth.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Atlas Scoticus</hi> or <hi>Deſcription of Scotland Ancient and Modern</hi> is to be in two Volumes; the one in Latin, the other in Engliſh.</p>
            <p>The Atlas in <hi>Latine</hi> may contain about an hundred printed ſheets of large <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard-Paper,</hi> in the great Letter the <hi>Atlas</hi> is uſually done upon: &amp; it will contain ſome ſeventy Maps, whereof there are upwards of twenty more than are in the <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Scotiae</hi> done by J. <hi>Bleau</hi>; and of theſe ſeveral are exactly ſurveyed. In this <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> Copy the <hi>Scotia Antiqua</hi> will take up more than twenty ſheets of Print, and is done exactly from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, and the beſt Manuſcripts and Ancient Records. The contents of the ſeveral Books are ſet down in the <hi>Latin</hi> Account pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scotia Moderna</hi> likewiſe is done in <hi>Latin,</hi> according to the account given there, ſo it remains that there be ane account given of the <hi>Atlas</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which is to be publiſhed firſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Atlas</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> may contain eighty ſheets of printed large <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi> paper, and about ſeventy Maps. It is divided into two parts, the General and the ſpecial part. The General part Containeth the general deſcription of

               <hi>Scotland,</hi> where there is a ſhort Deſcription of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Then <hi>Albanie</hi> or <hi>Ancient Scotland</hi> is briefly deſcribed, where the names and the reaſon of them are given; the condition of the Countrey from its firſt diſcoverie and Poſſeſſion till the coming in of the Romans; whence they came, where the firſt Inhabitants are ſhewed and the ſeveral Nations that frequented it then; and the cuſtomes, manners, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Government of the State under that Period are made known. Then the condition of the Kingdom, while the <hi>Romans</hi> were here, how far they prevailed, what Monuments they left, the diviſion of the Countrie and Names of the People then, the condition of the <hi>Picts</hi> till their Overthrow, and the planting of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> is manifeſted; The ſtate of Religion and Government from thence till <hi>Malcom Canmore,</hi> in whoſe time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, and the Titles, Manners, Cuſtomes of Living, which is now, was introduced. There is an Account alſo of the Forreigners, that invaded us during this Period.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Ancient Scotland</hi> belong theſe Maps.
