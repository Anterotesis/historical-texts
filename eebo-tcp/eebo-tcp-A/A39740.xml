         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to a Liberal and
ſpeedy Contribution to the poor
Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from abundance

ſuch as the Excellence of the Nature
of the Work it ſelf, the Example
of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and the Expectation that Church
had; the Reaſonableneſs of this that as they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
in every thing, ſo they ſhould alſo abound in
this Grace; from the Forwardneſs of others, from the
Example of Chriſt, who for their ſakes became Poor,
that they through his Poverty might be made Rich, from

the Diſtribution of Alms, the Liberality of

being a part of the Spiritual <hi>Service</hi> under the Goſpel,
and call'd in Ritual and Pontific terms, <hi>an Odour of a
ſweet ſmell, a Sacrifice acceptable well-pleaſing to God,
Philipp.</hi> 4. 18. and ſo in <hi>Heb. 13. 16. To do good, and to
communicate forget not, for with ſuch Sacrifices God is
well pleaſed;</hi> and its Commendation here is, that <hi>it
not only ſupplies the Want of the Saints,</hi> but it is
an Obligation and Incitement to theirs and others Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to God; it occaſions Prayers and Thankſgivings,
and the Name of God is thereby glorified. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Text will not juſtly allow, ſo I think the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of this Aſſembling will require no more at my
Hands, than the Treating of theſe two Heads in the
firſt place, and of applying them to our preſent purpoſe
in the ſecond.</p>
            <p>To ſupply the Neceſſities of ſuch as are in want, is
a Work of ſuch acknowledg'd Excellence in its own
Nature, carries ſuch Sweetneſs and Complacence with
it in its Practice; is ſo agreeable to all Mankind, and
of ſuch Pleaſing odour before God, that 'twere a kind
of Injury to any here, to ſuppoſe them ſo entirely
loſt to all the Principles of good Nature, of improv'd
Reaſon, and reveal'd Religion, as to think they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Conviction, or indeed Perſuaſion in this Caſe. It
is to be juſt to the Text, that I inſiſt a little on theſe
Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96754:3"/>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, It is a Work of great Excellence in its
own Nature, it is perfecting Human Nature, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
it as far as it can go; in nothing do we more
reſemble and draw near the Godhead than in that large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Heart, and Generous diſpoſition of Soul, from
whence the works of Charity proceed: and what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
in St. <hi>Luke</hi> by—<hi>Be ye therefore mercifull, as your
Father alſo is mercifull;</hi> is in St. <hi>Matthew—Be ye
therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is perfect.</hi> Tis honouring our Maker. Tis, in a
manner, and by his Permiſſion, Mending the Works of
God, and Bettering the Creation: For He in his all
wiſe Diſpoſal of Affairs, has ordered Matters ſo, that
there ſhould ſeem to be a great many Defects in
Nature, a great deal of Partiality in the Diſtribution of
the things of this World, and inequality in the Gifts
of Fortune; and hath ſubmitted all the World to the
dominion of what we call Chance and Accidents. And
this not through any impotence of Power, defect of
Foreſight or goodwill to Man; but moſt eſpecially for
the Exerciſe of the wiſdom and the vertue of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And therefore he that beſt repairs theſe Breaches,
ſupplies theſe Defects, makes up theſe Inequalities, and
beſt provides againſt theſe evil and unhappy Accidents;
improves the Human Nature moſt, and beſt deſerves of
it, does the moſt excellent and beneficial Work, acts
the moſt reaſonably, and moſt conformably to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will, he beſt accompliſhes the Works of God and
the Deſigns of Providence. It is hard to conceive an
attempt more Noble, or a work more Excellent than
what the Heathens call'd the Conquering Fortune, and
giving to Man a New Fate, but we muſt ſay than the
Reſcuing Human Nature from that Contempt and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96754:4"/>
into which our Sins firſt threw it, and under
which they keep it ſtill in bondage; which is done
(and never better done than) by the Exerciſe of
Charity. 'Twas Sin that firſt debas'd our Kind, and
firſt ſubjected it to Pains and Sickneſſes, Infirmities and
Wants, and all the Sorrows and Diſtreſſes, under which
we ſee and feel it labours, and to whatever makes us
the Objects of one anothers Pity and Compaſſion. And
God by his uſual methods (full of aſtoniſhing Love
and Kindneſs) hath dealt ſo graciouſly both for and
with us, that we may (like Himſelf) work good from
evil; and by a rare Reverſe of Providence, hath both
enjoyned and enabled us, to make theſe ſad effects of
Sin, occaſions of new Righteouſneſs, and of Deſtroying
ſin it ſelf; and in our own, and one anothers Miſeries,
hath given us, as it were, ſo many Opportunities of
exerciſing greater Graces, of practiſing more Virtues,
of raiſing the Soul to a Nobler pirch, and aſpiring to a
better Immortality, than otherwiſe, for any thing we
know, we could or ſhould have had. He therefore that
is practiſing Beneficence, feeding the Hungry, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Naked, viſiting the Sick and in Priſon, relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Diſtreſſed, and doing Good, is at the ſame
time Riſing as it were from <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, vindicating
Human Nature, aſſerting his Original, exalting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobling
of his Soul, and in a manner Triumphing, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
over Sin, and Death, and Hell.</p>
            <p>Yet after all, this Work of Love, is not more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in its Nature, than (to our Comfort) it is Secondly,
both ſweet and pleaſant in its Practice: And in good
Truth, 'tis very Happy for us that it is ſo, conſidering
'tis ſo frequently, ſo earneſtly, ſo inexcuſably injoyn'd
and made our conſtant Duty. Our Souls are ſo united
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96754:4"/>
to our Bodies, ſo cloſely tack'd and faſtned to their
Matter, and clogg'd with their Corruption, that tho
they can make ſhift to diſcern the reaſonableneſs and
neceſſity of performing their duty, yet they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly
mov'd to practice, unleſs ſome ſenſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of delight, accompanying the duty, be made
appear, and they be not only fed with future hopes
and expectations. Proportionable therefore to this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
and ſtrict injunction of this Duty, hath God
in his goodneſs made the pleaſure and delight that
conſtantly attends it. There is that ſweetneſs and
complacency in doing good to thoſe that want, that
even the bare deſires and wiſhes of it, when it is beyond
our power to do it, give us a good degree of peace and
quiet and content within; and we can ſatisfie our ſcruples
with the ſincerity of our deſigns and purpoſes: but if
we bring thoſe purpoſes to good effect, there is then ſuch
a ſpring of joy and contentation riſing in the ſoul,
the ſpirits overflow ſo pleaſingly, and the heart ſwells
with ſuch ſweet gayety and pride, that it is hard to
find a name for the delightfull paſſion, and we can
ſooner feel than can expreſs what 'tis we mean. And
though theſe extaſies abate in time, and languiſh by
degrees, yet the delights of doing good, purſue a man
as long as the remembrance of it laſts. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to call to mind a mans good deeds, or view the
objects of his charity, without abundance of content
and ſolid ſatisfaction. I make no doubt, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
and humble ſoul returns God frequent thanks for
his exciting and aſſiſting grace, but I doubt very much
whether 'tis poſſible in humane Nature, not to reflect
Honour and Pleaſure on ones ſelf withall; they do ſo
naturally flow, ſo unavoidably reſult from the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96754:5"/>
of thoſe Acts of Charity and kind Beneficence.
And <hi>Seneca</hi> had never more reaſon, then when deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
this Virtue, he ſaid it was <hi>Actio benevola tribuens
gaudium, capiénſque tribuendo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis agreeable to all Mankind—We are
frequently forc'd when we would recommend a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to our audience, to tell them, 'tis approv'd and
practic'd by all the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>ſober</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the World, which thô it is not ſo, yet it <hi>may</hi>
look like begging of the queſtion, becauſe we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
prepoſſeſs'd in favour of that Virtue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
may be thought to call and judge thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
Wiſe, and Good, and Sober, barely from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it. But when a man can ſafely ſay that all
the World approves a thing, that high and low, rich
and poor, young and old, good and bad agree to it,
and have been always of the Opinion; when they who
cannot practice it, ſtill wiſh they could, and they who
do not, are aſham'd, and make what ſhew they can,
as if they did; when no mans confidence or wit hath
ever carried him ſo far, as to diſpute its Excellence,
or praiſe its Oppoſite, a man muſt be forſaken quite
of ſenſe, and reaſon, and good manners, he muſt do
ſtrange violence to all the powers of his Soul, whom
the reverence that is due to the ſo general judgement
of the world, cannot impreſs upon, or move to the
belief and practice of this Noble Duty upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 'Tis acceptable in the ſight of God; it
muſt needs be ſo, he would not otherwiſe have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it on us with ſuch earneſtneſs, commanded it ſo
poſitively, and call'd upon us for performance ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96754:5"/>
and threatned its neglect ſo terribly, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Scriptures. It muſt needs be acceptable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are thereby kind to Him himſelf, in relieving
his Friends; for ſuch is his goodneſs, that he hath
made the cauſe of thoſe that want, his Own, and
reckons up the good we do to them, done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and will accordingly reward it. It muſt needs be
acceptable, becauſe we thereby exerciſe an act of faith
and confidence in his truth and goodneſs, we give him
ſomething ſure and in poſſeſſion, for the reverſion of
rewards, we know at preſent little of; we give becauſe
He bids, and truſt becauſe He ſays that He is faithfull.
And the Scriptures place a great deal of the merit of
<hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, in obeying when he was called to leave
his Country and his Fathers houſe, and going out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thô
<hi>he knew not whither he went;</hi> that is in ready con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and in implicit faith: it muſt needs be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
becauſe we thereby honour him in obeying his
commands, are juſt in owning him the Lord and true
Proprietor of all we have, and paying this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement,
and by ſhewing our ſelves gratefull, and in
ſome meaſure worthy of his mercies. And to conclude,
in a great many other ways, not needfull to recount at
preſent.</p>
            <p>But if the works of Charity are thus excellent and
ſweet, thus acceptable both to God and man, when
exercis'd on thoſe that <hi>only want,</hi> they are yet more
excellent and ſweet, and more agreeable, when exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd
on thoſe that want, and that <hi>deſerve</hi> them at the
ſame time. It is a great improvement of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when the adminiſtration of this ſervice ſupplieth
the want of the <hi>Saints.</hi> Not but that to ſtand in need
of Charity, is ſtrictly ſpeaking, to deſerve it, and is the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96754:6"/>
firſt and moſt immediate cauſe and motive both of
Giving and Receiving: ſo that he that asks and receives
upon preſumption of his Want, and yet wants not, is
at the beſt but a Deceiver and a Cheat; and he that
gives without Preſumption of that Want, may be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
or liberal, good natured, vain, or whatever elſe
he pleaſes, but not Charitable. But when both
Want and Merit meet, the Practice of this Grace is
much more ſatisfactory to ones Self, and more agreeable
to God and Man. It is a Complicated act of Goodneſs
then, it is approving and rewarding Virtue, encouraging
Religion, Induſtry and Honeſty, and whatever elſe may
be the merits of the Receiver, as well as pitying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
his Diſtreſs. Let us try (ſaid One of old with
admirable reaſon) how to make our Benefits moſt laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and moſt ſerviceable, and ſuch as may never turn to
Evil, and that will be by carefully and wiſely chooſing
where to place them moſt deſervedly; I will never give
Mony to a Man <hi>qui adulterae numerabit,</hi> I wont be ſo
far acceſſary to his lewd acts or purpoſes, I will if I
can reclaim him, but if not, I don't intend to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
or promote his Wickedneſs; with a great deal more
to good purpoſe, and agreeable to the voice of right
Reaſon, which adviſe us to aſſociate Prudence with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence,
and whilſt we are ſuccouring Human Nature,
to diſcountenance Vice and Immorality withall, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
Virtue and Religion, and ſerve the Intereſts of
the Commonwealth. And to tie this Duty cloſer, it
is now become an Obligation of Reveal'd as well as
Natural Religion, and we muſt, <hi>as we have opportunity
do good to all Men, but eſpecially to thoſe that are of
the houſhold of Faith.</hi> And amongſt other Duties
ſumm'd up in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. one is <hi>Diſtributing to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96754:6"/>
of the Saints;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes a journey on
purpoſe to <hi>Jeruſalem, to miniſter to the Saints,</hi> and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the Character of the <hi>Màcedonians,</hi> from their <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Contributions to, and that of the Houſe of Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi>
from <hi>addicting themſelves to the Miniſtery of the
Saints.</hi> And thô in all thoſe places, by the Saints we
are to underſtand <hi>Believers, Chriſtians</hi> in general, falſe
as well as true, yet we muſt underſtand withal, that
they were honour'd with that Name, from the <hi>Sanctity</hi>
of their Profeſſion, their holy Doctrine, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
holy Practice, as well as in Contradiſtinction, to
the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> and the prophane unhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Gentiles.</hi> So that as a Man muſt take all due care
in the Choice of fit and proper Objects of his Charity,
and ſee that they be good and truly Saints if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet he muſt not abſtain from doing Good, purely
upon the account of his Uncertainty, whether his Works
will be beſtowed deſervedly or no. A Man muſt not
frequently make the Suſpenſe of his Mind, a ground
for withholding his Hand: The Pretence will always
laſt, and without great Care, will prove a Snare to
Virtue; 'twill put him upon little Tricks and diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Shifts of pleading cauſeleſly againſt mens Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
'twill make him argue nicely and ill-naturedly,
and ſubtilly diſtinguiſh the Poor out of Relief, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
out of Charity, and engage him by degrees into
Hardneſs of Heart, and an inhuman Temper. Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
One but do his Beſt, and guide himſelf by the moſt
probable Appearances and outward Shews (of which
he only can be judge) and leave the Iſſue and Event
to God—To God, who has made it a Duty to be
Charitable, but has not withall given us a Spirit of
Diſcernment, to ſever Hypocrites from the ſincere and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96754:7"/>
honeſt Chriſtians; and ther fore cannot reaſonably be
thought to require this great Exactneſs at our Hands;
and is much too juſt and kind, not to reward our good
Intentions for the ſake of anothers undiſcoverable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity.
It is therefore good and neceſſary, it ſhews
our Hope and Confidence, our Faith and our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that we ſow our Seed at peradventure, but it is
better that it fall on Good ground; it is good that we
intend it well, but it is better thoſe Intentions find
their good Effects. It is a great Commendation of
Charity, that it ſupplies the Neceſſities of ſuch as
<hi>want,</hi> but 'tis a greater yet, when it ſupplies the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
of <hi>Saints,</hi> and truly Good Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, <hi>It is abundant alſo by many Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings
towards God. Whiles by the Experiment of
this Adminiſtration</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in the following
Verſ.) <hi>they glorifie God—Firſt,</hi> for their profeſs'd Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the Goſpel of Chriſt. <hi>Secondly,</hi> for their
liberal Diſtribution to them and to all Men. And
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> by their Prayers for you.</p>
            <p>If there wanted Arguments to advance the Praiſe and
Honour of this moſt excellent and uſefull Grace of
Charity, one might, without being too minute, and
forcing things unreaſonably, deduce a very certain,
and well grounded one from hence, that the works of
Charity are here made the Marks of our <hi>profeſs'd Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the Goſpel of Christ:</hi> That thô there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ways of appearing Chriſtians, ſuch as being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
into the Churches Faith, frequenting its Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
Partaking of its Sacraments, and Submitting to
its Diſcipline; yet that the cleareſt Tokens, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt
Indications, the openeſt and moſt avowed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of our Chriſtianity, is the Practice of Good
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96754:7"/>
Works, in Purſuance of its Holy Doctrine and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>But ſince there is no great need of this, I have
only to obſerve at preſent, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that their Charity
adminiſtred occaſion of Glorifying God, and Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Chriſtian Religion; <hi>Secondly,</hi> that they who
were, and were to be, Relieved, were Gratefull to
God by Returning him Thanks for the Liberality of
their Benefactors; and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Gratefull to their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
by Praying to God for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It occaſion'd the Glorifying God and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Chriſtianity. For as it is in Human Intercourſes
where when one Man by Counſel or Perſuaſion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
performs ſome brave and generous Action, part
of the Praiſe and Glory where 'tis known, will both
deſervedly and unavoidably reſult upon the Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and Setter on; ſo is it in the caſe of Charity 'twixt
God and Men. It muſt needs be that with Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
People, the Merit and the Glory of thoſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
muſt fall eſpecially on God, who firſt inſpir'd
thoſe Principles into the Souls of Men, from whence
thoſe gracious Acts proceeded.</p>
            <p>But farther their Works of Charity were Occaſions
of Honouring Chriſtianity, of preferring that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Oeconomy to both the <hi>Gentile</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.
Let Men contend never ſo long, ſo warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſo wiſely about the Preference of the ſeveral
Theologies, about the Excellency of their Doctrines,
and the Properneſs of their Natures, to exalt the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
to refine the Powers and Faculties of the
Mind, and raiſe the Souls of Men to a Nobler pitch,
and cloſer Union with the Godhead: Yet after all,
that Doctrine that is fitted beſt for the general Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96754:8"/>
of Mankind, and beſt conſults its publick Benefit
and Intereſt in this World (not excluding that of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other)
will certainly prevail and carry it above the
reſt, when once 'tis truly ſcann'd and underſtood. So
that had the Chriſtian <hi>Dogmata</hi> been as ſutable to the
Wiſdom of the World, and as agreeable to its way
of reaſoning as its practic Precepts were to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
and Benefit of Human Life, it had not ſtood
in need of Miracles, it had obtain'd that by its own
Reaſonableneſs and natural Force, which it did by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
and Divine Aſſiſtance; it was ſo calculated
for the general Good, conſulted ſo the Weal and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the World. Nay it diſpos'd the Minds of
Men ſo ſweetly to the Practice of Humanity, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
Charity, Beneficence, and in a Word to all
Good Nature, that even where Miracles were wanting,
both obſtinate and ſullen <hi>Jews,</hi> and vicious hardned
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> were by them often charmed into Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and always into Admiration of thoſe generous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines:
And even in ſpight of all the indigeſtible Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
of the Chriſtian <hi>Creed,</hi> they could not chooſe
but love the Chriſtian <hi>Practice,</hi> So that Doing good
and multiplying Acts of Charity, was the moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and ready way of heaping Honours on their Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of Conciliating the Eſteem and Favour of the
World, of Winning Proſelytes, and Gaining upon
thoſe that were without, and of Securing and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
thoſe that were already in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe that were relieved were gratefull
to God, by returning Him Thanks for the Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Benefactors. <hi>They glorifie God,</hi> ſays St.
<hi>Paul, for your liberal Distributions to them and to all
Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:96754:8"/>
However 'tis, that God impreſſes on the Minds of
Men, and moves them to good Works of Charity,
whether by ſtirring and impregnating thoſe Seeds of
natural Pity he hath ſown in all our Hearts, or moving
us by Hopes or Fears, by Promiſes or Threats, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
or Puniſhments, or by ſome ſpecial Act of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and exciting Grace, ſome ſudden ſweet Illapſes
from above, or ſome illuminating Viſion and Divine
Monition, or whether Men are mov'd themſelves, by
the Vanity of their own Hearts, by the Decency and
Comelineſs of thoſe Works, by the Ambition of Fame,
and the Reputation of being called Benefactors, by the
delights of Praiſe whilſt Living, and the Deſires of
Glory when they are Dead, or from what other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
certain or unknown, thoſe who receive the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
are moſt undoubtedly oblig'd to make their
due Acknowledgments to God, by their Returns of
Praiſe and Thanksgiving. For let the Cauſe and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and the Inſtruments be what they will, yet the
kind Fruits and good Effects will certainly require, and
certainly deſerve it at their Hands. The Goods are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
the Gifts of God, and the Diſpenſers of them
equally his Stewards (with reſpect to the Receivers)
as if they had had immediate charge there to beſtow
them. And God muſt not loſe his Praiſe, though the
Givers do; thô they too ſhould be Looſers onely in the
day of Recompence. We muſt not do as ſome Men do,
who ſee no farther than the Hand that reaches, and
only mind the next immediate Cauſe that miniſters to
their Relief, like ſome (but few) abſurd Idolaters of
old, that Deified the viſible and flowing Streams, but
never thought upon the hidden Springs from whence
they came; they entertain with joy and thankfulneſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96754:9"/>
to Men, the Pleaſures and the Benefits that they receive,
but never think of looking up to God, the Fountain and
Original of all their Happineſs. But 'twas not ſo with
thoſe of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> treats, they made the kind
Benevolence of their Benefactors an occaſion of Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
God, and Honouring his moſt Holy Name, and
by <hi>ſeeing and by feeling Mens good Works, they learnt</hi>
(as all of us ſhould do) <hi>to glorifie their Father in
Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> and laſtly, They were gratefull to their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors
by praying to God for them. It cannot fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be denied, but that there is a ſtrong propenſion in
us all, to ſelf-ſufficiency and independence one upon
another. No man can ſay, but he had rather want no
help, than be oblig'd to others for it; but ſince this
cannot be, the next thing we have to do, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive,
how to be even and on the ſquare again with our
Obligers, and the nearer we come to it, the freer we
think our ſelves, and certainly are more contented and
at eaſe: but ſince the ſtate of affairs in this life, will
not admit of equal gratitude in kind, or indeed in any
tollerable proportion, God in his goodneſs hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for the poor, the comfort and relief of Prayer,
and hath annex'd ſuch promiſes to the due performance
of that work, as may quickly equal the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
advantages they can receive from any of their
Benefactors; and hath made it their Religious duty as
well as their Natural deſite, to pay their debts and
obligations, and hath commanded them to ſollicit him
by earneſt Prayers and by inceſſant Cries to ſhower down
favours on their Benefactors heads; and as there is an
unaccountable venom in their bitter cries and curſes,
ſo have their Prayers a marvellouſly penetrating power
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96754:9"/>
and force. And of this the World hath been in every
age, ſo well aſſur'd, that there have not wanted men
of all conditions and degrees, Sons of Peace, and
Conquering Heroes, high and mighty Princes, Clergy,
Laity, learn'd and ignorant, that have exchang'd their
Gold and Silver, Lands, Jewels, rich Donations, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Settlements, ſtately Structures, Colleges and Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals,
for the bare purchaſe of theſe Prayers, and
thought it no ill bargain: That have look'd upon
their following Victories and Triumphs, the proſperous
and ſucceſsfull Iſſues of their undertakings, as ſo many
returns and anſwers of theſe Prayers, ſo many Bleſſings
forc'd from Heaven, by the ſweet violence of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
addreſſes to the throne of grace. So that
praying for Benefactors hath not been more eſteem'd
a duty on the Receivers ſide, than it hath prov'd a
motive and encouragement to Giving. And it may
be it is better to ſtop here, than proceed to tell the
extravagancies to which the exceſſive confidence that
men repos'd in theſe kind of Prayers and Services,
tranſported many a good, but indiſcreetly zealous Soul.
And ſince there is now no danger from the examples,
let us rather chooſe to cover, than excuſe or condemn,
the faults (ſhall I ſay) or rather the miſtakes of our
Forefathers.</p>
            <p>And now, having done what right I could be well
allowed to do the Text, I am come in the ſecond
place to apply what I can to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> if St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo earneſtly exhorts to, and
commends a Piece of private, caſual, temporary, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient
Charity; how much is due, what might be ſaid
of ſuch a publick, ſo deliberately deſign'd, and ſuch a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96754:10"/>
Laſting one (an Everlaſting one I hope) as I ſtand here
the Gratefull Subject of? <hi>A private Man may caſt his
Bread upon the Waters in hopes to find it after many
days, and give a Portion to ſeven and alſo to eight, becauſe
he knoweth not what Evil ſhall be upon the Earth.</hi> And
if notwithſtanding this Deſign, and theſe ſelf-intereſted
Principles, the Work is excellent and acceptable both to
God and Man; it muſt needs be infinitely more ſo, when
a <hi>Prince</hi> becomes the Donor, under whoſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
none of thoſe Hopes or Fears can reaſonably be
thought to fall. And if the Relieving private and
ſome few Perſons, want not its Praiſe and Glory, they
muſt both of them riſe as the Merit does, where the
Publick is oblig'd, and all may put in equal Claim and
Title to the Benefaction, that will be content with his
way of Education. The Story is well known to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi>
be ſure, but he that would record the Virtuous Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Fair Endowments of our Glorious Founder,
to thoſe that are without, or to Poſterity, could not
by any means forget that moſt Remarkable and Noble
Inſtance of his large and comprehenſive Soul, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly
Rejecting one of our firſt Governours, for his
too partial Fondneſs to his Native Countrey, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to appropriate all the Royal Bounty to it
only; conſidering with Himſelf, that though a Private
Man might do the ſame with Reaſon enough and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
too, yet that a <hi>Prince</hi> ſhould both in this and
every thing beſides, approve Himſelf a <hi>Father of the
Publick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A form'd premeditated and deliberate work
of Charity has certainly the advantage of a caſual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
One; this may be wreſted only by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of ſome that want, compliance with the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96754:10"/>
of the place, forc'd by the example of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and ſhame of being ſingular, or expreſt from men
by the lamentable moans and preſence of ſome piteous
object: and men are often ſeen upon removal of thoſe
objects, and the going down of thoſe mechanick ſprings
of tenderneſs to harden and return again to their ill-natur'd
tempers, and frequently repent them of the
good they did, wiſhing themſelves again poſſeſſors of
their riches. But he that acts deliberately, that forms
his deſigns beforehand, without any preſent artificial
motives, and certainly intends them for a laſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to all poſterity, muſt be preſum'd in reaſon and
in juſtice to build upon the beſt and ſureſt grounds, to
proceed upon the nobleſt and moſt perfect Principles. It
can't indeed be ſaid, that this Foundation was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of <hi>many Years before,</hi> for the King Himſelf was
then but Twenty three at the moſt, an Age moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
of little Thinking with Great Men, or at beſt, of
little elſe, than how to paſs away that Spring of Life in
Gaiety and Pleaſure. But yet it was his Earlieſt Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
and Deſign, and had for ſome conſiderable time
been the whole Employment of his Thoughts, and his
Heart was ſo intent upon the Matter, that he had little
Reſt, till he had brought it to a hopefull Proſpect, and
to ſome Degrees of its Perfection. It was no ſudden ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
Thing that mov'd HIm; it was not the Effect
of his Relenting Thoughts, after the ſhedding ſome Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Blood, by the Rage of his own Hands, or by the
haſty Execution of ſome furious Order; for he was Meek
and Mercifull, Sparing of Blood, and tender to his Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine:
of ſuch a Gentle and Forgiving Diſpoſition, that
when a rude and impious Souldier ſtruck him knowingly
in priſon, He afterwards upon the Throne, rebuk'd him
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96754:11"/>
only with a piece of Scripture, told him, he <hi>ſhould not
ſtrike the Lords Anointed.</hi> Nor was it an Effect of his
Repentance upon the Cooling of his Youthfull Blood,
nor of the Injunction of his Confeſſor, for ſome Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances
common to that Age. For what was ſaid of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<hi>Gratian,</hi> may be ſaid of Him with equal Truth, not
<hi>Veſta's Altar, Pontifex his Bed, nor Flamen's Pillow</hi> was
more pure and holy than his Chamber. No Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Wife, no Noble Virgin, Private Maid, or Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
Spouſe of Chriſt call'd at his Hands for Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to their injur'd Honour. He was of ſuch white Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and ſuch unſullied Sanctity in that behalf, that He
could not bear thoſe Liberties and Freedoms, that ſince
make up the very Innocence and Modeſty of Courts.</p>
            <p>This Virtue was in Truth ſo much his own, and ſo
peculiarly engroſs'd up by Him, that He ſeems to have
carried her to Heaven along with Him; and not to have
left Succeeding Kings the very Virtue of Hypocriſie, no
not ſo much as the Grace to diſſemble any kind of liking
to that Purity. Nor was it an Attonement for ſome
loud Oppreſſion, Violence, Injuſtice, or ſome Sacrilege.
<hi>It is</hi> (ſaid One of old) <hi>the laſt Defence of Wicked Kings
to take away from Some, to give to Others, and deprecate
the Envy and the Odium of their preſent Rapines by ſome
large Works of Bounty to Poſterity.</hi> But 'twas not ſo
with Him; for thô his Reign were long and troubleſome,
and its Years might have been nam'd and numbred from
ſome remarkable Calamity befalling His Perſon or His
Government, His Affairs perpetually embroil'd by the
prevailing Faction of his powerfull Rival and Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for Soveraignty, and by the Paſſions of his own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
and Intriguing Queen, by the Rude works of
War abroad, and by the Miſeries of a worſe at Home,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96754:11"/>
and conſequently a great deal of Injuſtice muſt be done,
yet no Man ever had the hardineſs to charge the King
with any Evil; and that not for Good manners or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
but for the Truth and Juſtice ſake. And 'tis ſo little
likely He would cement our Buildings with the Blood or
Tears of the Oppreſſed, that when He was in want of
Money to expedite his Intentions, and was ſhown the
way, by Seizing to that uſe the Eſtates of ſome that
had forfeited them by Treaſon, He generouſly rejected
their Advice, and could not bear the Thoughts, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
One in after Times ſhould curſe our Walls, and call
with bitterneſs and anguiſh of their Souls for their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
Patrimony.</p>
            <p>It is not without Deſign (I own) that I have choſen
to recommend Our Founder and Foundation from theſe
Topicks. For they who are converſant in the Hiſtories
both of our own, and other Nations (and I am ſenſible
where I am) know very well, that Blood, and Luſt, and
Violence, have laid the Bottoms of more Abbies, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries,
Nunneries, more Chantries, Priories, more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitals
and other Charitable Houſes, than any other three
much better Principles, And thô the good Effects may
have atton'd for their bad Cauſes, the goodly Children
anſwer'd for the ungracious Parents; yet no one (ſure)
can be ſo partial to the Fruits, as not to wiſh they had
ſprung from a more Creditable Stock. And I cannot but
think We have ſome Advantage in having ſo Mercifull,
ſo Chaſte and Righteous a King our Founder, and mov'd
by no other Principles than thoſe of Honouring God,
and Benefiting Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Excellence and Merit of the Bounty we
are Sharers of, riſe yet much higher, than that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by its Advantage of Duration and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96754:12"/>
Continuance. That was a temporary tranſient Act, but
This has all the Eternity that human Things admit of.
That call'd for new Supplies within a while, This only
wants, that Men would have the Fear of God before
their Eyes, and would withhold their hands from Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
and Robbery. Farther, That but ſupplied the bare
Neceſſities, This both the Eaſe and the Conveniences of
Life. That made Life tolerable, This might make it
eligible; it were not for the Honour of theſe kind of
Works to ſay they went much farther: to ſay they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
us with a luxurious Table, an overflowing Bowl,
or miniſtred to our Exceſs in any kind. 'Tis enough
that they indulge to ſomewhat more than is required by
parſimonious uncorrupted Nature, by ſober well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Reaſon, and by the Auſterities of Chriſtian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline.</p>
            <p>The laſt and greateſt Advantage, that ariſes to Us from
this ſort of Bounty, is, that it ſupplies the Neceſſities
of the Mind and Soul, it gives us opportunities of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
the powers and faculties of the One, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
the true and everlaſting Intereſt of the Other.
We are here at perfect Eaſe aud Liberty, free from all
other Cares and Troubles than what we ſeek, or draw
upon, or plunge into, our Selves: entirely vacant to the
purſuits of Wiſdom, and the Practice of Religion: have
all the Helps, and all the Encouragements that We can
want or wiſh for. Here We conſult with dead Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
and living ones; may underſtand the rules of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by the Examples, and learn the Precepts from the
apparent Practice of every Grace and Virtue. Here We
have Opportunities of Frequent Sacraments, and more
than Daily Prayers; a kind of Force and moſt agreeable
Neceſſity of being Good, or of appearing ſo, or being
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96754:12"/>
ſingular in Evil, of proof againſt the Injunctions of our
Governors, the force of Cuſtom, and the influence of
good Examples, and conſequently Sin without Excuſe.
In a Word, if we would meaſure our Felicities by the
Judgment and Opinion of the World without, by our
own Longings and Deſires after this ſtate of Life, before
we have attain'd it, or by the Torments and Vexations
that attend the Remembrance of having left a while, or
loſt, or ill improv'd it, we muſt conclude that we have
Opportunities of being Learned, Honeſt, Sober, Good
and Happy Perſons; and that it is in our power, by co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
with the good Grace of God, to fulfill the Words
of the Text in their moſt Literal ſenſe, and ſhew that
the Adminiſtration of this Service ſupplies the <hi>Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Saints,</hi> ſuch as are truly <hi>ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains in the ſecond place, that it be <hi>abundant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in many Thankſgivings unto God,</hi> and that in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Method. <hi>Firſt,</hi> by Ordering matters ſo, that the
Diſtributions of our Benefactors may be an Occaſion of
glorifying God and our Religion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that We
thank God for our Benefactors, and <hi>Thirdly</hi> and laſtly,
that We pray for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt order matters ſo, that by the Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
of our Founders, the Name of God and Chriſt
be glorified. We live not indeed amidſt the <hi>Jews</hi> or
<hi>Gentiles</hi> now, and conſequently cannot either profit
them by our Good, or ſcandalize them by our Bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
or glorifie God by their Converſion. But it
may be we live amidſt as Sullen and Perverſe, and as Ill-natur'd
a Generation, as either of the former. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
what I ſaid of the Judgment and Opinion
of the World in general about our Happineſs, yet there
want not Some, that are weak and apt to be offended
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96754:13"/>
at, Others rejoycing in, our Failings, and watching cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
for our Miſcarriages; ſome cauſeleſly complaining
of our Way of Education, ſome of our want of Zeal
and True Devotion, (one may gueſs what they mean;)
ſome of our ſheltering Ignorance and harbouring Idleneſs,
ſome of our Uſeleſſneſs and Inſignificancy to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
moſt of them meaning all the while we are
too Rich and Happy, and calling for a Reformation to
the Priſtine Purity, becauſe they think 'twill bring the
Priſtine Poverty along with it. So that we have need
to walk with all the Care and Circumſpection in the
World; redeeming the Time (for indeed the Days are
evil) loſing no Opportunities, but improving our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
to all Advantages on all Occaſions; both fearing
God, and regarding Man, approving our Selves to our
Selves, and providing things Honeſt in the ſight of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Letting our Light ſhine before Men, adorning
our Profeſſion, and Living up to the Rules of our Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;
and by theſe Means, when Men ſhall ſee us thus
Induſtrious in our Way, thus happily employed in Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and in Practiſing the Rules of Wiſdom, Virtue and
Religion our Selves, in countenancing and teaching O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in cultivating, watering and improving all thoſe
Generous and Noble Plants they ſend us hither, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
them Fair and Flouriſhing in all that is Good and
Excellent, when they ſhall find the benefit and comfort
of thoſe ſweet Living Streams that overflow from this
<hi>Immortal Spring,</hi> they will be tempted ſure to change
their Minds, diſcharge their Hearts of their Malignity,
glorifie God and Chriſt, and bleſs the Bounty and the
Hand that miniſtred to ſo much Good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We muſt be Thankfull to God for our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors.
For thô the glorifying God, both in our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96754:13"/>
Bodies and Spirits which are Gods, and reflecting Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
on his Holy Name, by a Religious Sober Uſage of
their Benefits, be both the Beſt and Trueſt way of
Thanking him; yet 'tis not of it ſelf ſufficient, We
muſt expreſs our Gratitude in ways befitting reaſonable
and honourable Creatures, agreeable to God and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the World; ſuch as Rejoycing, Praiſing and
Thankſgiving, ſuch as may alſo edifie the Hearers and
the Standers by, and may excite them to the Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe Vertues and Excellencies they hear and
ſee extoll'd in Others. And thô I did, in reckoning
up the Benefits we receive, lay down ſo many Grounds
of our Thankſgiving, and have already mentioned
ſome peculiar Virtues of our Royal Patron, yet I
ſhould ſcarce acquit my ſelf of what I owe to my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
unleſs I offer in its Name, peculiar Thanks and
Praiſe, Honour and Glory to the Eternal Inexhauſted
Spring of Bounty, for all the Advantages we in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
receive: and ſure I ſhould but ill become This
Place, anſwer but ill the Purpoſe of this Day, if I
ſhould ſuffer Works of ſuch Magnificence to lie in
common Heaps of Charity, and be content with Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Commendations, paſſing the Good King <hi>Henry</hi>
over together with the <hi>Crowd</hi> and <hi>Multitude</hi> of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
His Honors ſhould no more be common, undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd
ones, than were his Merits; his Praiſes ſhould
at leaſt equal his Private Virtues, if they may not riſe
up to his Royal State and his Magnificence. And thô
each of them ſingly were a Task, and when conſpir'd
and met in one, might rather cauſe one to deſpair of
being Juſt, than fear the falling into ſervile Adulation
or Extravagance; yet not to pay down ſomething were
intolerable, and to imitate the Iniquity of bad Debtors
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96754:14"/>
that chooſe to be unjuſt to <hi>all</hi> their Creditors, for fear
of being ſo to <hi>ſome.</hi> And as for Fame, I count a Parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of it here were next to Sin; it can be never bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſpent, it never can be better loſt, and no Good
Man but will ſay as <hi>Mamertinus</hi> did to <hi>Julian—Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
eloquentiae Laudem, quam Pietatem officiúmque me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
deſiderari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In compliance therefore with the Text, I thank the
Immortal God for that Munificence, by which Two Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Great Societies were Founded and Endowed: which
notwithſtanding all the Depredations they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,
do yet ſubſiſt in Pair and Honourable manner, and
are, if not the Envy, yet at leaſt Part of the Praiſe and
Glory of their Neighbours; for making a King, a Young
and Mighty King, the Inſtrument of ſo much Good;
for Inſpiring into his Soul ſuch Chriſtian and ſuch Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Purpoſes; inſtead of all thoſe vain, ambitious
towring Imaginations, thoſe wicked, wanton and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Thoughts, that fill the Heads and Hearts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Princes; for giving us a Founder, whoſe Bounty
makes Us not more happy Men, than his Example would,
if followed, happy Chriſtians: for the Advantage of all
thoſe excellent Graces, and illuſtrious Virtues that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
his Life, and ſhone ſo eminently in Him: for his
early Zeal and Piety, his ardent and unparallel'd Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towards God: for his innocent and uncorrupted
Youth; for his Sanctity, Sobriety, and Temperance in
every kind; for his great Love to Learning, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
yet to good Morality, and true Religion: for the
firm and ſteady Virtues of his Manhood: for his Care
of all his Life; and that incredible Watchfulneſs over
all his Thoughts, and Words and Works; inſomuch that
in Twelve Years time, his Confeſſor found no occaſion to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96754:14"/>
injoyn Him any Sort of Pennance: For his ready Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the Will of God in all Conditions; for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Patience under all the Sorrows and Diſtreſſes, the
Dangers and the Difficulties, the Exiles, and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with which his Life was exercis'd for One and
Fifty years: and laſtly for his Holy End and Sufferings,
being found at his Devotions,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>R.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</note> by that Inhumane Prince
that ſtabb'd him to the Heart, and loſt expiring out his
Soul amidſt his Prayers.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Virtues I can thank God for, without
a Bluſh or ſecret Check, for fluttering or enlarging.
Rare, and unſeen in Kings, and read by private Men with
wonder and confuſion: ſo that I doubt if moſt of us were
left to judge of them by the faint Purſuits and feeble I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
we have made, there would be great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to conclude againſt their Truth and Poſſibility.
Theſe are the Virtues, better far befit the Fame and
Memory of Chriſtian Kings, than thoſe of Glorious He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,
and Triumphant Conquerors, Enlargers of their
Empires, and Terrors of their Generations. For the true
Engliſh of thoſe Pompous Titles is, that they have been
the Plagues of the Earth, and mighty Murderers of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that they have made Millions of wretched Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
Orphans and Relations; have turned fair King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
into fields of Blood and Horror, and overrun the
World with barbarous Waſt and Deſolation. And thô
theſe Bears and Tigers, Wolves and Foxes, are in ſome
manner Neceſſary and Uſefull in the World, and make a
glorious Buſtle whilſt they live, and we are pleas'd with
the Relations of their Acts when dead; (better when dead:)
Yet no Man in his wits, that can conſider, and might
chooſe his State himſelf, but would prefer the <hi>Palms</hi> of
innocent and ſuffering Kings, to all the <hi>Lawrels</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguin'd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96754:15"/>
Wreaths of thoſe Renowned <hi>Nimrods.</hi> Theſe
are the Virtues we can thank God for, becauſe they are
ſo uſefull, and ſo edifying to the World; ſo ſafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to all Mankind, but eſpecially ſo proper for our
private Imitation; ſo ſuited to our way of Living, that
one would think the Godly King had liv'd on purpoſe
for <hi>our</hi> Uſe and Service, and that our Statutes had been
copied from his Practice, with ſome deſign to ſhame us
into Duty, or make us inexcuſable, if we could other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
abuſe ſuch Bounty, neglect ſuch Virtue, and refuſe
to write after ſo fair and goodly an Original.</p>
            <p>And this is all the Incenſe I will offer to our Glorious
Founder. For thô I ſhould extract the Quinteſſence of
all the flattering Acclamations of the ſlaviſh Senate down
from <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to <hi>Auguſtulus;</hi> the nobleſt Flights, and
moſt exalted Strains of the Panegyriſts from <hi>Pliny</hi> to
this Day; the Dedications, the Devices, Mottoes, and
Inſcriptions of our neighbouring Kingdom to their vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
Monarch, or from the ſervile and degenerate Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Addreſs at home; and could refine upon them all,
and raiſe Him up a Monument of Praiſe, as Fair and
Beautifull, and Juſt withall, as <hi>This</hi> I praiſe Him <hi>in,</hi> yet
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, if there be any ſenſe or underſtanding of
our Mortal State; if they Above, receive Acceſſion of
Beatitude from any thing we ſay or do below—I know
his Innocent and Righteous Soul, will take more joy, be
better pleas'd, if what I have ſaid, can either move my
ſelf, or any here, to the Improvement of one Grace,
the Exerciſe of one Virtue, or to the Amendment of
one evil Practice.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We muſt pray to God for our Benefactors. I
know very well whither the Application of this Part of
the Text, would have naturally led me, if I had liv'd,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96754:15"/>
when this great Anniverſary was firſt deſign'd, or a hundred
Years after it. It was their way to ſhare the time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to theſe Exerciſes, betwixt the venting trifling and
inſipid Praiſes of their Subjects; and they were forc'd
moſt commonly, for want of Truth, to feign their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
firſt, like thoſe of Heroes in Romances, and then
praiſe them: and betwixt the offering Prayers for reſt
and quiet of the Souls of the Departed, and other ſuch
Expreſſions, as ignorant good Nature, vext and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with uncertainties, and hopes and fears, and tender
ſcruples, firſt ſuggeſted, and afterwards improv'd to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and dreadfull Superſtition: And the Choice of this
moſt Solemn Dedication Day, was to have directed me,
to whom in Heaven I was to have made my moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Addreſs. But God be thank'd, that Task is
ſpar'd, thoſe Days are gone, and now paſt proſpect of
Return; the Text means no ſuch thing as Praying for
the Dead. The Good King <hi>Henry</hi> is, if any one, at
Reſt, and wants no Prayers. The ever Glorious, ever
Bleſſed Virgin, wants nor requires no Service of that
nature at our Hands. 'Tis God alone that asks, and
that deſerves that Noble Sacrifice, and to Him only let
us offer it, as is moſt due, with all humility of Soul;
and beg of Him, that We, according to the Example of
this Righteous Prince, may paſs our Lives here in his
Faith and Fear, and may with Him and all Good Souls,
be made Partakers of a Glorious Reſurrection in the
Life to come, through the Merits and Interceſſion of
our ador'd Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt, To whom with the
Holy Ghoſt be aſcrib'd all Honour, Praiſe, and Glory,
now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
