            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Preſently vpon that another Lady replied and ſaid, that we ought at all times be readie to giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our faith: that <hi>Du Moulin</hi> ought not deny to inſtruct them herein which did demand it of him: whereunto <hi>Du Moulin</hi> anſwered, that hee knew well enough, they did not aske this for any deſire they had to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11465:4"/>
be inſtructed; and to diſpute about religion with women, which tattle altogether; and after they are gone publiſh what they pleaſe, were to wrong the truth of religion. One among them replied, that ſhe could not ſatisfie her ſelfe as concerning this Article, and that it was often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to her, how that our Miniſters were not able to giue an account of their Miſſion and Vocation. <hi>Du Moulin</hi> anſwered, that he wondred much how ſhe forgat to aske a reaſon of them for the iuſtifying of theirs: and that had ſhe ſo done, ſhe ſhould haue found them leſſe able to ſatisfie her: that euery one which preſumes to aske a reaſon of another for the maintaining of his voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought to be ſure that he is able to iuſtifie his owne, and be readie at any time to yeeld a reaſon. He had no ſooner ſpoken theſe wordes, but in comes <hi>Gontier,</hi> with two others, which brought many bookes along with them; <hi>Gontier</hi> at his firſt entrance asked what was the matter? what it was that was ſaid there? Why my Lady heere (ſaid <hi>Du Moulin)</hi> requires a reaſon of me to iuſtifie my Miſſion: and I told her, that ſhe ſhould haue deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the like of you, for the iuſtifying of yours.</p>

               <p>It is no ſhift at all: for whoſoeuer is ſo bold, as to demaund a reaſon of another for his vocation, bindes himſelfe thereby to giue an account of his owne. But if you will confeſſe that you are not able to defende yours, I will preſently heere take vpon mee to defende mine.</p>

               <p>As for your dignitie I denie that you haue any ſuch ſuperioritie ouer me. But to the point, I heere maintaine that you haue no commiſſion; for you call your ſelues Prieſts, and haue receiued this order of prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in this manner: which is, that the Biſhop, hauing anointed your fingers, and impoſed his hands, ſaith vnto you; <hi>Receiue power to offer vp ſacrifice to God, and to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Maſſe, as well for the liuing as the dead:</hi> By this meanes he hath made you Sacrificers to ſacrifice Ieſus Chriſt.

               <p>This word, <hi>to Sacrifice,</hi> in his primary ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation imports as much as to do an holy thing; but the Apoſtles were ordained to do an holy thing, therefore the Apoſtles were ordained to ſacrifice.</p>

               <p>We haue nothing to doe here with Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies, but with the ſence of this word, <hi>to ſacrifice,</hi> as it is taken in the Church of Rome, to wit, to offer vp really vnto God the body of Ieſus Chriſt in a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie ſacrifice for the liuing and the dead. To pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God is to do an holy thing, yet neuertheleſſe euery one that praieth is not therefore a ſacrificer in this ſence: whereupon it followes that the concluſion is nothing to the purpoſe, ſince the word, <hi>to ſacrifice,</hi> is taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in another ſence then we take it.</p>

               <p>I do not agree with you in that, and doe call the company to witneſſe, if there be any one here which hath hitherto heard Maſter Doctour ſpeake one word to proue that Biſhops haue authoritie from God to eſtabliſh Sacrificers in the Church: or that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were Sacrificers, to ſacrifice Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>In the 26. of Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> it is ſaid that the bloud of Chriſt is ſhed for the remiſſion of ſinnes, now where the bloud of Chriſt is ſhed there is a ſacrifice; and all that is auaileable to the remiſſion of ſinnes is a ſacrifice.</p>

               <p>You take that for granted which you are to proue, to wit, that the bloud which you ſay to haue been ſhed in the Sacrament hath beene offered vnto God; Secondly I anſwere, that you doe fallaciouſly adde this ſame word, Ioine, to that which I haue ſaid: that in the 26. of <hi>Mathew</hi> it is truly ſaid of the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bloud which by nature is ioined with death, But I ſay that when the very bloud of Chriſt is really

               <speaker>Du Moul.</speaker>
               <p>This doth not enforce at all, that Ieſus Chriſt did offer his bloud vnto God in the Euchariſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Gont.</hi> Hereupon after ſome ſilence, and complainte of the Ladies, deſiring vs to conferre about ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter, at laſt <hi>Gontier</hi> ſtood vp vpon his legges, and framed an argument; which he would not write, but <hi>Du Moulin</hi> writ it as he told it him: the argument was this, The bloud of Ieſus Chriſt which is ſhed for the remiſſion of ſinnes, muſt of neceſſitie be offered vnto God, but in the inſtitution of the Euchariſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in 26 Chapt. 28. verſe of Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> the bloud is ſhed for the remiſſion of ſinnes, therefore it muſt needes be offered vnto God.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Du Moul.</speaker>
               <p>I denie that the maior propoſition is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies true, for ſhould the very bloud of Chriſt Ieſus be ſhed in that ſame action of the Euchariſt, it would not follow, that it were offered vnto God for a ſacrifice: for it might be offered or preſented to the Communicants, and not vnto God: It is ſufficient that he hath beene offered on the croſſe: As for the ſecond propoſition, I acknowledge that the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt was ſhed,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11465:7"/>
but vpon the croſſe: Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith truly that the bloud of the Lord is ſhed, but hee meanes vpon the croſſe; as the Romiſh Bible witneſſeth; and the very Maſſe, which turne it in the future, <hi>effundetz,</hi> that the bloud of the Lord ſhall be ſhed, I aske of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctour whether he will renounce his Bible, and his Maſſe.</p>

               <hi>Gont.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Du Moul.</hi> Anſwered that our tranſlation was turned faithfully according to the Greeke, and that this did proue nothing, but that the expoſition of the Romiſh Church which the bibles approued by the counſell of Trent and the Maſſe it ſelfe doth carry, is falſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gont. Gontier</hi> then made one of <hi>Robert Stephens</hi> Greeke Teſtaments be brought vnto him, and for to weaken the authoritie of the Greeke text ſaid that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things there had beene changed, and that at the end

            <p>
               <hi>Du Moul.</hi> Anſwered that theſe diuers readings did not alter the ſenſe at all; that all this inueighing againſt the originall of the new-teſtament did not help him a iot to proue that which as yet he could not proue: to wit, that Ieſus Chriſt offered vp his bloud to God in the Euchariſt, and he called vpon <hi>Gontier</hi> to proue it, <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi> continuing in denying to proue it to him, and the diſputation being there at a ſtay, all the Ladies to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him entreated them to talke of ſome other ſubiect, and ſaid that this matter was to deepe for their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.</p>

Cor. 10. chap. 16. verſ. The bread which wee breake is the communion of the body of Chriſt;</hi> An expoſition which the Church of Rome doth reiect, not beleeuing at all that it is bread, nor that we breake bread; nor that this bread ſo broken is the communion of the body of Chriſt, ſeeing that it is his very body: Hereunto adde, that the Euangeliſts do with a ioint conſent witneſſe, that Ieſus Chriſt broke bread and gaue it: <hi>He tooke bread broke it, and gaue it:</hi> Therewith the Church of Rome,

                  <hi>Gontier</hi> on the contrarie oppoſed againſt this, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid in the Euchariſt, that the body of our Lord is broken for vs: that the bread whereof hee ſpeakes, ſaying <hi>The bread which we breake is his fleſh,</hi> as it is ſaid in the ſixt of Saint <hi>Iohn, The bread which I will giue is my fleſh.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Du Moul.</hi> Replied and ſaid that herein <hi>Gontier</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted the Church of Rome, which doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue at all, that the Lords body is broken in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, and asked of <hi>Gontier</hi> whether he would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to this: That the Church of Rome doth beleeue that the body of the Lord is broken in the Euchariſt: that <hi>Gontier</hi> by this word, Bread, meaning the body of Chriſt makes the words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ridiculous, making him to ſay, that, <hi>the body of Chriſt, which wee breake, is the communion of the body of Chriſt.</hi> That in that place of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> he ſpeakes not at all of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, but promiſeth to yeeld himſelfe vnto death, as he makes manifeſt by the words following: <hi>The bread which I will giue, is my fleſh which I will giue for the life of the world,</hi> now he did not giue himſelfe for the life of the world, but in his death.</p>

                  <hi>Gont.</hi> Hereunto <hi>Gontier</hi> anſwered nothing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that theſe words, <hi>I will giue,</hi> being twiſe repeated were taken in two ſeuerall ſignifications.

Alſo Madam, I thinke you haue not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the cauſes, which moued you to this change. For example can you ſhew vs any places of the Scripture, wherein wee are commaunded to paint God, and to make carued images of the trinitie in ſtone: The Lady anſwered that ſhe would not take vpon her to prooue that in the preſence of a Doctour: <hi>Du Moulin</hi> then ſhewed her the 4. Chapter of <hi>Deuteron.</hi> at the 15. verſ. and following, where God forbids any image to bee made like vnto him; She on the contrary alleaged the images of the Cherubins; But <hi>Du Moulin</hi> told her that ſhe ſpake of the images of God, and that a Cherubin was no God.</p>
               <p>As for the images of Creatures, he asked her, if ſince her change of religion, ſhe had ſeene any commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God for the worſhipping of creatures images: <hi>Gontier</hi> did releeue her a farre of, crying out of his corner where he was retired; Madame, inſtance in the braſen Serpent, being the image of Chriſt, who was both God and man, tell him withall, that there was ſacrifice and incenſe offered before the Cherubins.</p>

                  <hi>Du Moul.</hi> Anſwered that the braſen Serpent, was no image of Ieſus Chriſt, but a figure of his office, and ſauing vertue; that ſuppoſe it were his image, yet it was

not an image of his diuinitie: that he could neuer find that the Iſraelites did worſhip it, but that they were tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for idolatrie: and laſtly that there was neuer any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice or incenſe offered vp before the Cherubins, there being alwaies a vaile interpoſed.

him to Monſieur de <hi>Liembrune,</hi> for bearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo daſtardly in the fight, ſaying that he did this to comfort my Lady of <hi>Liembrune</hi> which wept? why was I conſtrained to turne for him to a paſſage of Scripture which hee could not finde? why did he ſtand ſo many times ſo long, together without ſpeaking a word? why (he being at a non-plus, and not able to iuſtifie the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Biſhops for the ordaining of ſacrificing Prieſts) was I forced to change my queſtion, for to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him? why did hee withdraw himſelfe out of my preſence to hide himſelfe in a corner? why did hee blot out that which I had written? why did he teare the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which himſelfe had written? whereof I can yet for aneede produce ſome peeces: And note that he tooke mee vnawares then, when I thought of nothing leſſe then conferring with him; but hee came prepared and furniſhed with bookes hauing agreed on this confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence before hand with the Ladies; I am alſo giuen to vnderſtand by the report of men worthy of credit, that a few daies after the conference, <hi>Gontier</hi> dining with my Lord the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and my Lord the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> that the Prince askt <hi>Gontier</hi> as concerning this matter, telling him there went a ſpeech abroad thereof which tended little to his praiſe; and that the ſayd Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite imputed his little reſiſtance to the great noiſe there was made: but eſpecially to the earneſt entreatie of an aduocate; yet there was no aduocate nor anie ſtirre, but onelie towards the latter end, the three firſt houres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt ouer with a great ſilence, euerie one looking that Maſter <hi>Gontier</hi> ſhould ſpeake, whilſt hee did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but turne the leaues of his Concordance, and made as though he did write.</p>
            <p>Now to iuſtifie this which I ſpeake to bee true, I call the aſſiſtants for witneſſes which ſate there from the beginning to the end, and God knowes that in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11465:11"/>
which I haue publiſhed, I haue dealt as faithfully as I cold poſſible, hauing ſhew'd it ready writen to thoſe which were preſent at it; to the end that if I had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my ſelfe in any thing, they ſhould correct what was amiſſe; yea I haue yet ſome part of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gontiers</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments written with his owne hand, of the which hee doth not ſo much as repeat one word in his letter; wherein he reduces our conference to a douzen lines, not for breuities ſake, for he breakes out into other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable diſcourſes, but by an apparant ſhift: for in our conference there were two points aboue others that we chiefely handled: one, whether Biſhops were authorized from God to eſtabliſh Sacrificers for to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice Ieſus Chriſt: the other, whether it could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be prooued that Ieſus Chriſt did offer vp his bloud to God in the Euchariſt: becauſe, that although his bloud were really ſhedde, yet it is not a ſacrifice if the bloud be not offered vnto God.</p>
            <p>Theſe two points beeing of ſuch importance, how comes it to paſſe that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gontier</hi> writing to the King, doth not ſatisfie them, nor ſo much as mention a word of them at all? did he thinke his Maieſty vnworthy to be throughly informed in the truth of the matter? or why doth he fruſtrate the people of this their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if in the conference hee had not a word to ſpeake heereupon, why doth he not yet repaire his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit heerein by his writings vpon farther ſtudie? why is he ſo loth to ſpeake anie more of the paſſage in Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which is in the 9. Epiſt. of the firſt booke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by my Ladie Baronneſſe of <hi>Salignac,</hi> doth hee not perceiue by this that he hath ſpoken nothing worth the conſidering, but that a ladie hath ſpoken that which deſerues to be weighed?

that this is the 66. chapter; when Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are not diſtinguiſhed by chapters; doubtleſſe my Ladie of <hi>Salignac,</hi> who hath ten times more learning for a Ladie, then he for a Doctor, could haue taken him vp for this: Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> indeed ſpeaks in the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, of alters and ſacrifices, but by ſacrifices he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the preſents which the people offered on the table, of which one part was laid aſide for the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Euchariſt; wherefore in his Sermon of almes he takes vp the rich men which men which came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue without offering anie ſacrifice: <hi>Doeſt thou come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the Lords Table without a ſacrifice, doeſt thou take part of the ſacrifice which the poore hath offered?</hi> and in the ſame ninth Epiſtle, in the honour of the brethren which offer vp offrings, as if they did receiue the tithes of fruits, <hi>Let them not depart from the Altar, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</hi>

And that couſenage and tyrannie are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed vnder the ſhew of religion.
