            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AND he is to be Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd,
That the cogent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which over-rul'd my
Thoughts, to engage at this
time in a Diſcourſe upon this Subject,
is, becauſe I am convinc'd, that there hath
not been the ſame Induſtrious Care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
to Controul the <hi>Atheiſt's</hi> Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
againſt the Belief of <hi>A Future
World's Exiſtence,</hi> as in many other
Caſes of leſſer moment and danger, it
hath been expreſſed.</p>
            <p>For tho' Men may Anſwer in Excuſe
for that Omiſſion, becauſe a profeſs'd
Unbelief of that State, is in its ſelf ſo


<pb facs="tcp:42467:6"/>
odiouſly abhorrent, as that few Men have
adventured the reproach of making any
Open Diſcoveries of their Unbelieving
Sentiments: Yet ſuch as are guilty of
that Omiſſion, have not well conſidered,
what an Inclination there is in Men,
groſly Irreligious, to liſten to any ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions,
which may (tho' covertly) licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
their continuance in their moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and Immoral Practices; Nor have
they conſidered, that there hath not been
ſuch men wanting, as were ready in their
looſe and complying Societies, (tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
but ſlyly and ſportfully) to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
ſuch Atheiſtical Thoughts into their
Aſſociates Heads, (of the prodigious
Effects of which we can't be unſenſible:)
I ſay, theſe things conſidered, (of which
I ſhall preſently give a further account)
I know not what can be ſaid in real
Excuſe for that Omiſſion.</p>
            <p>And further, to evince the Truth of
this Charge, let the numbers of Books,
which relate to the different Opinions


<pb facs="tcp:42467:6"/>
about Religion, be computed, in which
Fellow-Chriſtians have expreſs'd their
Zealous Labours one againſt another;
and then let a Man examine how few
Treatiſes there be extant, which have
been engaged in the Defence of <hi>another
World's Exiſtence,</hi> in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as might convince Atheiſtical and
Doubtful Minds, and I am confident,
ſuch an Enquirer into that Diſparity,
will find, that not One Book of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
hath born any ſingular Attention
to that Work; and yet perhaps none more
Needful to have been undertaken; as I
ſhall preſently make it appear.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, I have a good while had
theſe Papers finiſhed by me, but I have
been hitherto diſcourag'd from publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
them, becauſe I perceiv'd the late
Controverſies have ſo ſwallowed up the
Minds, and devour'd the time of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men, that the Books upon any other
Subjects could obtain no attentive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
at all; Nor would thoſe men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit


<pb facs="tcp:42467:7"/>
themſelves to enquire after any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
but ſuch as bore ſome alliance
to thoſe preſent Controverſies.</p>
            <p>But now, at this juncture of time,
ſuppoſing Men to be throughly wearied
with thoſe Toſſings of Diſpute; and
with being continually Spectators of ſuch
endleſs Oppoſitions; and even nauſeated
with thoſe numerous Pamphlets, ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
almoſt every Week, with the heaps
of which, their very Houſes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred,
as well as their Heads: I
ſay, I imagined, for thoſe Reaſons, that
ſuch men would now be in a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if it were but to alleviate their
faſtidious Minds with ſome Variety, to
attend to ſome other Diſcourſes, which
might abett no Party on either hand.
And the preſent Subject, I am ſure,
may challenge an Exemption from any
ſuch byaſs'd Concernment.</p>
            <p>And then more particularly, this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
may the rather claim a greator
Attention from every Party, becauſe it


<pb facs="tcp:42467:7"/>
is in the Defence of a Subject which is
the Prime Fundamental (next to the
acknowledgment of a GOD) upon which
all Religions, howſoever variated by
different Perſwaſions, muſt neceſſarily
be ſuperſtructed; and without a firm
Belief of which, what would ſignifie ſuch
elaborate Multiplications of the preſent
Controverſial Differences? Which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
by ſome mens manner of manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may, in time, give no ſmall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for the Uſefulneſs of ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
as this: Eſpecially if there ſhould
be the ſame Event from the Inteſtine
and Civil Wars of the Pen, as from
thoſe of the Sword; according to my
Lord <hi>Verulam</hi>'s Obſervation about the
Introduction and Encreaſe of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I wiſh I had no more to
ſay to my Honeſt-minded Reader for
his ſatisfaction. But ſome Captious men
have provided other Work for me. For
I hear (upon the very notice of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign)
that there are many Exceptions


<pb facs="tcp:42467:8"/>
intended, whereby to over-rule the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
and to diſparage the Lawfulneſs
of my whole Undertaking. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I muſt entreat my well-intending
Reader's Patience, while I endeavour
to ſolve the Import of thoſe Exceptions
before I begin. And they are eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theſe Four.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some (as I hear) are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to ſay, that this Author must needs
himſelf ſuppoſe, and would have others
to think, that there be many People at
this time, who are very extraordinarily
Defective in their Belief of this Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Article; or he would never
have taken upon himſelf to engage in
this particular Subject, with ſo much
earneſtneſs; nor have been ſo ſolicitous
in ſolving every Little Allegation and
Exception, as if a ſtudied Sceptick ſtood
alwaies at his Elbow, to ſuggest them
to him.</p>
            <p>My Solution of this Exception is,
That I muſt needs Confeſs, I do really


<pb facs="tcp:42467:8"/>
think, that there are more Conſiderable
Numbers in the Nation, (occaſion'd
principally by the Former Ages unhappy
Rebellion) than men are ordinarily aware
of, who do at this time (tho' for fear
or ſubtilty they don't alwaies diſcover
their Thoughts) either wholly diſown the
Being of any <hi>Future</hi> at all, or elſe
that do admit the Belief of it, but <hi>(di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiata
ſide)</hi> with a ſceptical and
doubtful Faith, and under ſome diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
Apprehenſions; ſuch as may Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
them in their Irreligious Ways of
Living, without any controul from a
Senſe of what's to come in <hi>Future.</hi>
And if thoſe mens Practices may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
for a Demonstration of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in their Faith, what Arguments
of that kind can be ſuppos'd to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in their Actions, to aſſure ſuch an
Evidence?</p>
            <p>For tho' it's true (as ſome are apt to
alledge) that a bare ſupine inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and odd Nations of Religion in others;
and perhaps ſome Unhappy Educations,
and diſadvantageous Exemplifications in
many more, may ſo far prevail, as that
many men may be tempted to a Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
of Converſation; that is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to be engaged in ſome faſhionable
Vices, and common Follies; or to be
regardleſs of ſome Religious Offices: But
when we ſhall ſee men ſo profeſſedly
Wicked, as to make no Conſcience at all
of the groſſeſt Immoralities; and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
as to make a Mock of all the
ſalutary Expedients which a Gracious
GOD hath provided in His Church for
their Eternal Good and Happineſs; What
can induce a Man to think otherwiſe,
but that ſuch mens minds muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd,
either with a Latent Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of <hi>Another World;</hi> or with ſuch
an imperfect Senſe of it, as by which
their Thoughts might not be affected
with any Judgment or Puniſhment to
come, for whatſoever they do?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42467:9"/>
And why may I not think my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
to be reaſonably enough deduced,
when (if the <hi>Targums</hi> ſence of the caſe
may be accepted) ſuch an Obſervation
may be verified from the Beginning of
the World, in the Famous Caſe of <hi>Cain</hi>
and <hi>Abel?</hi> Here lay the ground of their
vaſtly-different States and Events. The
one believed a <hi>Future State,</hi> and made
uſe of his Faith to perform an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sacrifice to GOD, in order to a
Future Reward: The other Brother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the Being of ſuch a state. For
whereas its ſaid, <hi>(Gen. 4. 8.)</hi> That
<hi>Cain</hi> talk'd with his Brother <hi>Abel;</hi>
(as the <hi>Targum</hi> expounds it) the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
was about a <hi>Future World;
and</hi> Cain <hi>told</hi> Abel,<note place="margin">Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit Cain &amp; dixit Abeli, non eſt judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, nec judex, nec ſaeculum aliud, &amp;c. Reſpondit Abel, eſt judicium &amp; judex, &amp;c. Et propter harum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum caulam, contendebant ſuper facies agri, &amp; ſurrexit Cain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra fratrem ſuum, &amp; fixit lapidem in fronte ejus, &amp; interfecit eum. <hi>Targ. Jonathan. B. Vriell. Bibl. Polrg.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that there was
neither Judgment nor Judge, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
nor World to come,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>But</hi> Abel <hi>told him, that all thoſe
were to be believed as true.</hi> Upon


<pb facs="tcp:42467:10"/>
this Difference <hi>Abel</hi> ſuffer'd Martyrdom
in defence of his Faith; and <hi>Cain,</hi> by his
Unbelief, became a Murtherer, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
miſerable.</p>
            <p>Now, as no man can think it impoſſible,
but that there may be ſome men in this
Age, who may be as irreligious and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
as revengeful and prophane as <hi>Cain</hi>
was; then why may it not, without breach
of Charity, be preſum'd that there may be
ſuch alſo amongst us, as have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in their minds the ſame Atheiſtick
Principles which <hi>Cain</hi> indulg'd? And
tho' this my Conjecture may ſeem to ſome
men ſurprizing and too ſevere, yet I
can't imagine how any obſerving man can
behold the little conſcience that is made but
of that one Horrid and crying ſin of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
only, by which the Power and Juſtice
of God are ſo often dar'd to his Face; and
the import of the Sacred Bible, upon which
they ſwear, as often ſcorn'd, and (as it
were) defied, but he muſt incline his mind
to my unhappy Conjecture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42467:10"/>
But if ſome men, (out of civility to
Mankind, the Nation and their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours)
ſhould refuſe to admit ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of anſwer to this Exception and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to think, that there be no men ſo
defective in their Faith of another World,
how irreligious ſoever they may be in their
Lives; yet I can aſſure my ſelf, that this
my Diſcourſe may be uſeful, not only to
them, but even to the moſt Religious ſort
of Believers; Who may be highly pleaſed
and gratified, when they ſhall underſtand
that that Fundamental upon which they had
adventur'd all their hopes of being in Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Bleſſed, ſhould not ſtand upon the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
point of Believing, for which they might
ſuffer, from ſome Atheiſtick Perſons, the
reproach of an eaſie Credulity, (a <hi>Credat
Judaeus Apella)</hi> but that they can
now be able to defend themſelves in that
point, againſt ſuch Atheiſts, even upon the
Evidence of their own Principles.</p>
            <p>2. The next Exception is entertain'd
by them, who will ſay, that my way of


<pb facs="tcp:42467:11"/>
Arguing for <hi>another World's Exiſtence
by Rational Demonſtration,</hi> is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the diſparagement of the Evangelick
Revelation; and that it calls in queſtion
its ſufficiency to do its own Work, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
brought Immortality to light, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the moſt convincing Evidence for the
Belief of another World. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is now no more need to fly to
Philoſophical Argumentation, than there
is to the Miracle of one riſing from the
Dead for further Conviction. For ſay
my Exceptioners,<note place="margin">Luke 16. 29.</note> they have <hi>Moſes</hi> and
the Prophets, to whom the Unbelievers
being ſent, the Officers of Religion are
diſcharg'd of any further Care for ſuch
mens recovery from their Infidelity. But
then alſo they will be ready to object
and ſay, that ſuch a Proceedure, by Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Demonſtration, will turn all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
into Scepticiſm, and bring Chriſtianity
back again to Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In my anſwer to this moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Exception, I ſhall conſider of what


<pb facs="tcp:42467:11"/>
importance that alledg'd Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is, to make good that Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me in this Caſe. And then I
ſay, that that Text is only to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
that the Divine Revelation
may be ſufficient for the Belief of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World's Exiſtence,</hi> without any
new inſtances of Atteſtation; ſuch an
one, as one riſing from the Dead, to
confirm the Credibility of that, which
was ſufficiently teſtified before. But it
doth not thence follow, tho' there ſhould
be no more need of Teſtimonial Proof,
That men ſhould be denied (when the
occaſion eſpecially requires it) the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and Uſe of Rational Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to evince the Truth of <hi>A Future
World's Exiſtence.</hi> Which when
it's done, it will be ſo far from being
a Diſparagement to the admitting the
Truth of it by Divine Atteſtation, That
it will add much to the Credit of the
Teſtimonial Authority, which exacted
the Obedience of ſuch a Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42467:12"/>
And therefore, ſince it hath pleaſed
God Almighty to allow Men the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of both ways to evince the Truth
of this Fundamental Principle of all
Religion, ſurely it was not his deſign,
that they ſhould diſparage or amaze one
another, but that they ſhould be Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and ſubſervient one to another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I anſwer, That it was a
method which the Church frequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to convince the Heathen World;
eſpecially when Miracles became unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
Therefore <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi>
owns both thoſe Advantages from
God: Firſt, that of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">—<gap reason="foreign">

as principally
to be attended to; and
then alſo of Philoſophical
Demonſtration to be made uſe of, in
the behalf of the <hi>Gentile</hi> World.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Primitive</hi> Apologists tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
me ſuch a Copy of what I have
here attempted, (tho' they manag'd it
by meaſures agreeable to their then Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents)


<pb facs="tcp:42467:12"/>
that either my Exceptioners muſt
queſtion the proceedures of thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Defenders of Chriſtian Faith, or
they must think themſelves unjuſtifiable
in condemning me. Eſpecially when
they may conſider, that it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that I may have a ſort of men to
deal withal, who may maintain as stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
an Oppoſition to the Scriptural
Revelation, and all other the Churches
Teſtimonial Proofs of a <hi>Future States
Exiſtence,</hi> as thoſe ancient Heathens
may be preſum'd ever to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
And by the Senſe of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of ſuch an Obſtinate Modern A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm
was <hi>Curterius</hi> Govern'd, when
he gave his Reaſons for the Edition
and Interpretation of the Famous Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
<hi>Hierocles.</hi>
               <note place="margin">—Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, qui philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus, ab illis id extorqueret, (niſi hominis naturam exuerint) quod divini Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Authoritas perſuadere non potuit. <hi>Praef.</hi>
               </note> As when he ſaith,
That <hi>it was not without a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence that ſuch a Book
ſhould come to publick View,


<pb facs="tcp:42467:13"/>
which by Philoſophical Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
ſhould extort thoſe Truths
from them, (unleſs they would
unman themſelves) which the
Divine Revelation could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with them to admit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I anſwer, in Juſtification
of thoſe Ancients. Practice, and my own
Undertaking, That there is no Attempt
or Method ſo proper, and in its ſelf ſo
reaſonable, to bring ſuch Atheiſtical
Minds to embrace the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as that which I have endeavour'd
by this preſent Diſcourſe. For if once
ſuch mens Underſtandings can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
by any means, to entertain an
aſſur'd Acknowledgment of <hi>A Future
World's Exiſtence;</hi> and then ſhall be
ſenſible of thoſe events, which are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
conſequent to ſuch an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
it will of courſe engage them
(if they have any minds at all) in the
ſtudy of finding out the beſt way, how
they might moſt ſecurely provide for their


<pb facs="tcp:42467:13"/>
own Safety in ſuch a <hi>Following
World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when, for that purpoſe, they
ſhall have conſider'd of, and ſurvey'd
the ſeveral Modes of Religion in the
World, they cannot but find Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
more accommodable to the ſerious
Conceptions of an Intellectual Mind,
than any Inſtitution that was ever ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to the Thoughts of Man, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when he ſhall underſtand that it
is a Principle that hath in all Ages en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
the Teſt and Tryal of the acuteſt
Literature; and hath hitherto born
down all Oppoſitions with the greateſt
Succeſs. That hath been innobled with
the higheſt inſtances of Generous Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
even to Death it ſelf, in the
declar'd defence of it. A Religion that
hath made the moſt abſolute Proviſion
for the Welfare of all Societies: That
is, that it keeps up Soveraign Power
with the Intireſt Loyalty, and the Rights
of Men with the exactest Juſtice, and


<pb facs="tcp:42467:14"/>
provides for the Needs of Mankind
with the Tendereſt Mercy. And that
where its Inſtitutions are truly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
it makes men civil and obliging;
placable and condeſcending; and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
them to do nothing, but what is
ſeemly and prudent, faithful and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</p>
            <p>But then, when upon theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Thoughts, our Convert, by ſuch
a Rational Conviction, ſhall be once
brought to the Door of Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
(the main intention of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign)
he is not to expect, nor will the
Chriſtian Inſtitution admit it, that the
Heavenly Contrivance and myſterious
Doctrines of it, ſhould depend upon, or
neceſſarily be accounted for, by the ſame
Rational and Demonſtrative Way of
Proof, which at firſt induced him to
entertain the Thoughts of Embracing
the Profeſſion of that moſt Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
He will then find Reaſons to
think, That to Believe will be made


<pb facs="tcp:42467:14"/>
his Duty; and that he must <hi>Walk by
Faith, and not by Sight,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
declares poſitively. And that then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
he muſt not give leave to his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
mind; to be alwaies enquiring for
Demonſtrating Reaſons for every thing
that is tendered to his Belief. It's
true, That <hi>Rational Evidence</hi> did
first bring him to Chriſtianity; but it
must be his Faith, that will make him
a true Profeſſor of it: And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of his Life and Actions to that
Holy Faith, will at luſt bring him to
the Happineſs of that Future World;
of the Existence of which, he was ſo
convinced.</p>
            <p>And thus, I hope, I am ſufficiently
acquitted of that ſuſpicious Objection,
as if, when I endeavour'd by <hi>Rational
Evidence</hi> to bring an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> to the
Belief of ſuch a World to come, that
I deſign'd to turn all Religion into Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm,
and the Christian Faith to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
This ſolves the Second Exception.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42467:15"/>
3. The Third Exception is made by
them, who will be ready to ſay, That
ſince I have undertaken, against the
Modern Atheiſts, to <hi>Demonſtrate a
Future World by Rational Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
how comes it to paſs, that I
have not alſo endeavour'd to Offer at
the ſame Way of arguing, to evince the
Being of One Supream GOD? And
<hi>Is there not</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the ſame
Neceſſity for the one, as for the
other, againſt the Atheiſt's Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Exception my anſwer is,
That in the management of this my
Demonſtrative Way of arguing for <hi>A Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
World's Exiſtence,</hi> I have not
been precariouſly Preſumptive of any one
other Principle, either Philoſophical or
Divine, but only of that One, <hi>viz.</hi> the
pre-ſuppoſed believ'd Exiſtence of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
and Infinite GOD, as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and conſequently the Soveraign Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of that His Created World.


<pb facs="tcp:42467:15"/>
And I preſum'd, that ſuch a Conceſſion
no man, that conſults his Reaſon, would
ever deny me, becauſe no man can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
His Divine Exiſtence without a
Violence offer'd to his Reaſoning Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
In which, if that Notion
be not naturally implanted, (as many
Learned men believe) yet it will ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulably
Command any Conſidering
Minds aſſent, as that no Nation, how
barbarous ſoever, nor any man ſo rude,
but he muſt ſubmit to the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Deity;<note place="margin">Tuſc. Quaeſt. Lib. 1.</note> as <hi>Cicero</hi> poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcourſeth.</p>
            <p>But if my Exceptioner ſhall, in
prejudice to me, ſtill proceed to lay that
Omiſſion, as a ſtumbling-Block, in my
way, I deſire that he would but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
conſider, Whether the Opinion of
the World's Eternity, or its coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that Figure, in which it now exiſts,
by the caſual Confluence of little Atomes
(the only two Refuges to ſupport the
Denial of ſuch a First creative Cauſe)


<pb facs="tcp:42467:16"/>
can be manag'd in any man's Thoughts
ſo accommodably and naturally, as may
the acknowledg'd Being of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
GOD, to be the Original Creator
of ſuch a World; whoſe Greatneſs
muſt proclaim His Power; whoſe
Orderly Figure His Infinite Reaſon;
and whoſe regular and conſtant Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
in that Order, when ſo many
Beings are naturally ſubjected to ſuch
numerous intercurrent Motions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies,
muſt evince His Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Wiſdom and Government? This
the Third Solution.</p>
            <p>The Laſt Exception, with which I
am moſt likely to be attack'd, is offer'd
by them, that will ſay that my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
is upon a Subject which hath
been already handled by a great many
conſiderable Authors; and that I ſhall
but ſtill add to the ſo much complain'd
of redundancy of Books, with which the
World is already too much incumber'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42467:16"/>
My Anſwer to this Exception is;
That as I had never enquir'd after,
nor ever read any Treatiſe that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the Defence of <hi>another World's
Exiſtence,</hi> before I had exactly fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
my own Arguments; ſo ſince,
though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have made as ſtrict an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
as I could, to find out ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeſ,
I could not meet with any but
ſuch, as generally manag'd this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Caſe, either but as in ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive
Paſſages, or as occaſionally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
woven in Diſcourſes otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd.
And where any Treatiſes may
have given any likelihood of being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
publiſhed for the purpoſe in hand,
yet their Arguments were too conciſe
and ſummary, to ſolve a nice and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Doubt, much leſs to over-rule an
Obſtinate Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>For though the Subſtance of the
Truth might be couch'd in ſuch ſhort
<hi>Mediums</hi> of Proof, yet <hi>I</hi> conceive,
that they were too like the contracting


<pb facs="tcp:42467:17"/>
a conſiderable Controverſial Caſes, into
an Article of <hi>Aquinas;</hi> which muſt
be preſumed to be by far otherwiſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
manag'd, when the controverted
point ſhall be agitated by induſtrious
Oppoſition. And which then may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
whole Volumes to diſcharge the
Debate, when a few Lines, at another
time, would have ſerv'd the turn.
<hi>I</hi> ſay, the Arguments were too Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
and Epitomiz'd, and therefore
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> many caſes, for want of fuller expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
they would ſeem to be built
upon Principles and Premiſes too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariouſly
preſum'd. And then, for
that Reaſon alſo, they could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
provide againſt thoſe numerous
Exceptions, which Scrupulous and Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Minds would be apt to interpoſe;
and of which there muſt have been more
particular and exact Solutions, or ſuch
men would never have admitted the
Concluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42467:17"/>
To avoid all thoſe Inconveniencies,
I have endeavour'd in the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of my Arguings to underſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
what could poſſibly be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
in ſuch Caſes; whereſoever I
could either hear, read; or think of
them. And if thereby I may ſeem to
have made too Copious Enlargements,
either in the Explanations of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
or ſolving the Exceptions, I
muſt crave ſuch Readers Patience and
Ingenuity to think, that I have done it
for their ſakes, who (I thought) did
ſpecially need them, or that would
exact them from me. And thus my
Fourth Exception is ſolv'd.</p>
            <p>But, I confeſs, I might have moſt
juſtly ſubjoined one more, and perhaps the
Greatest, and with which I am ſure to
be ſufficiently aſſaulted; and that is,
the Unſufficiency of my Performance.
But of that I need not be advertis'd,
I have Reaſons enough in my own
mind to humble me; and no Man can


<pb facs="tcp:42467:18"/>
ſpeak meaner of it than I think.</p>
            <p>I know it were ſilly in me to ſay,
I was too inadvertently ſurpriz'd into
an Allowance of the Publication of this
Treatiſe, or that when it was once in
a Learned Friends hand, I did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give him leave, but deſir'd him,
that a flame might make it never to
be thought on more; yet this I am
ſure, I may inoffenſively ſay, that I
ſhall be ſo much the leſs concern'd at
whatſoever kind of Reception, the nice
Age ſhall pleaſe to allow it, as that I
have but a ſhort ſtep to make, before
I ſhall enter into that other World,
where (to be ſure) I ſhall not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the little Notices of a <hi>For</hi>
or <hi>Againſt.</hi> But if I were ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate,
as to be concern'd, yet I
could not but conſider, that there is but
a Die caſt for my Lot: And that a
Book's Entertainment in the World, is
even as Hazardous as a Juries Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict;
where Diſſatisfaction, Prejudice;


<pb facs="tcp:42467:18"/>
or Ignorance, may caſt the iſſue on the
wrong ſide. It may be my caſe, tho'
this whole Preface was deſign'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
ſuch a Conſequence, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a neceſſary defence of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject's
Uſefulneſs, and my own Credit,
againſt ſuch Exceptions as are manag'd
againſt both. And I hope this will juſtly
plead my Excuſe for the length of ſuch
an Introduction.</p>

               <head>The Summ of the
FIRST ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>THE Firſt Argument deſign'd
to demonſtrate the neceſſary
Exiſtence of a Future State,
is founded upon an obviouſly
acknowledg'd Obſervation, That there is
not Univerſal Juſtice, Judgment and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
done to Mankind in this preſent
World, according to the different Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
of their Lives and Actions.
But that Good Men, and their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cauſes, are very frequently oppreſs'd
and defeated; and that Evil Men, and
their Unjuſt Undertakings and Practices,
as commonly proſper and ſucceed.</p>
               <p>All which cannot but reflect upon the
eſſential Goodneſs and Wiſdom of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
GOD; becauſe thoſe unequal


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42467:25"/>
Proceedings and Events could not be
acted, and brought to paſs, without His
Divine Permiſſion; and alſo, becauſe it
was always in His Power to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
them when he pleas'd.</p>
               <p>Now if nothing elſe can ſolve that
Reflection upon thoſe Divine Attributes,
but only the belief and acknowledgment
of a Future World, to which God's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
and compleat Adminiſtrations of
Justice, Judgment, and Equity, ſhould
be reſpited and adjourn'd: That is, if
it ſhall appear, that that Adjournment of
it to that State, can only ſecure the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
in its naturally ſtated Order; and
then that no other ſeaſon of its Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
can ſo ſufficiently acquit GOD's
gracious care of, and love to Mankind, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Nature he gave them: Then
it muſt needs follow, That he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
and conſtituted ſuch a Future
World, and State.</p>
               <p>Now, that this Argument may more
fully attain its deſigned End, and that I


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42467:25"/>
may take away all poſſible Exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Premiſes, or what relates to
them, I ſhall divide the general Concern
of it, into Three Chapters or Heads of.
Diſcourſe, in order to the clearer Inference
of the Concluſion at laſt.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Chapter, I ſhall offer to
proof, That what is juſt and equitable,
will by a Good and Juſt GOD be impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
adminiſtred to all ſorts of Mankind,
according to the different Qualifications of
their Lives and Actions, at one time or
another; that is, either here or here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>In the Second Chapter, it will be made
evident, That Almighty GOD doth not
execute ſuch an univerſal adminiſtration
of Juſtice to Mankind in this present
Life; and then I ſhall take into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
what an Influence that Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
had upon the Minds of the Heathen
World.</p>
               <p>In the Third Chapter, it will appear,
That GOD's reſpiting and adjourning


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42467:26"/>
the compleatly impartial Adminiſtration of
His Divine Juſtice to a Future World, can
only ſolve the apprehenſions we have, That
GOD intended to preſerve the preſent
Univerſe in the ſame Order that his
Power and Wiſdom had at firſt Created
it, eſpecially as to his Divine Care of
Mankind, whether as ſocially, or indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
conſider'd.</p>
               <p>And if all theſe Three Premiſes ſhall,
upon ſufficient Proof, be found to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
true; there will be no Cauſe at all
to queſtion the Concluſion for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Exiſtence of another World.</p>

that is, Good to all Perfection.</p>
                  <p>Now whatſoever Being, is in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
or ſenſe, a real Goodneſs in it ſelf,
muſt be ſuppoſed to afford a reaſon of
that denomination, from a Good that is
done according to its capacity, where
there be Objects that need it, or Cauſes
that require it.</p>
                  <p>And if the Goodneſs of God be ſuch,
(which no man can ſuſpect without Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheming
the Divine Nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42467:27"/>
his own Reaſon) the mind of
man cannot poſſibly ſuggeſt a doubt, but
that it ſhould expreſs it ſelf in the Caſe
in hand. That is, that a God of infinite
Goodneſs and Equity, when it is always
in his Power, as to underſtand, ſo to do
all that is good and right, ſhould at ſome
time or other, vindicate and juſtify the
innocent Cauſes of Good Men; that is,
ſhould recompenſe and reward their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved
Sufferings; eſpecially when for
their adherences to vertue, they have
been haraſſed and perplex'd by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
uſages of unjuſt and unreaſonable
men. I ſay, if the verification of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Goodneſs be not to be thus expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
What Caſes are there, by which the
reaſon of man can be otherwiſe ſatisfied,
that that glorious Attribute hath a title
to the ſame perfection, which the reſt
are preſumed to have? or how otherwiſe,
in any kind of practical Notion, can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reaſonable Being underſtand, for what
end or purpoſe he is commanded or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to be good at all? or how can a
created moral Agent be ſo accounted
either by God or Man upon ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion?
To refuſe to do Right &amp; Good,
when it is always in his capacity to do
it, would make but an untoward Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of ſuch a Perſon, by an indifferent


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42467:28"/>
Judge of what Goodneſs is. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſuppoſe God (with <hi>Epicurus)</hi> to
be ſo wholly unconcern'd in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World, and eſpecially at what
happens amiſs to good men in it, ſo as
to take no care at all of their vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when they are unjuſtly uſed and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
would be reaſon enough, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to reproach God's infinite Goodneſs,
but, upon a very reaſonable conſequence,
to tempt men to queſtion his whole Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.

                  <p>THE Second Reaſon is alledg'd from

And the reaſon of this deduction is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
either the ſame Wiſe God, that


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42467:28"/>
form'd him into ſuch an arbitrary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
muſt have certainly provided and
conſtituted for him ſome ſuperiour Judge
and common Arbiter, by the dread of
whoſe ſoveraign Authority and Juſtice,
he might ingage his mind and conſcience
to do what's juſt and good, and to whom
he might be accountable for his actions
whether good or evil; or it muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
that God made him poſſibly to be,
the moſt (I may ſay the only) lawleſs,
unſociable, and ungovernable part of the
whole Creation. That is, that he ſhould
live (as it is manifeſtly ſeen men do,
where ſuch a Judge is neither regarded
nor ſufficiently conſidered) both to be
his own folly and ruin, and the world's
trouble and misfortune.</p>
                  <p>

Judge of all his actions, and from whom
he might expect a reward, and dread a

                  <p>Now if ſuch an Univerſal Judge, and


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42467:29"/>
Arbiter muſt for that reaſon be thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
ſuppoſed, then it's certain that
there can none be believed to be ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally

God that Originally gave man his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;

was inveſted with a natural Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <p>For none can be ſuch a competent
Judge, but a Being that is Omniſcient,
and ſo is capable of underſtanding all
Cauſes, Minds, and Actions; that is of
an infinite goodneſs, and so can love,
approve, and bleſs all that is done well,
juſtly, and worthily: And laſtly, of an
infinite power ſo as to be able to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
all his own judiciary purpoſes and
determinations, how and when he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>No Being, that wants any of theſe
qualifications, can poſſibly be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judge of Men and their Actions,
ſo that Univerſal right and equity may
be compleatly and impartially done to
the whole world of ſuch Rational and
Voluntary Agents. And becauſe God
Almighty can only be qualified for ſuch


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42467:29"/>
a Judge, what can make a Suſpicion,
that he ſhould not execute that juſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,

                  <p>As for what concerns the committing

undertake the vindication of all
righteous perſons and cauſes, and bring
them all to a true balance of impartial
Right, is from a plea, &amp; a juſt appeal, (and
that upon moſt Rational Conſequences)
which all that are unjuſtly oppreſſed,
may make to the holy and ſoveraign

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> By alledging, that the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuous

was naturally ſo diſpoſed by
God's own Original pleaſure and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as poſſibly to admit and produce
ſuch unequitable effects. And therefore
the evil uſages of vertuous and good
men in ſuch a world, muſt needs, in
that reſpect, be the conſequences of ſuch
cauſes and occaſions, which God might
have prevented if he had pleaſed, but
which themſelves could not controul,
when they would.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> And more particularly, good
men that are ſo oppreſſed, may further
alledge, that thoſe very faculties and

only the Iſſues of Gods own Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

                  <p>And from hence it is,<note place="margin">Jud. 3. 12.</note> that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
(to whom an Atheiſt will permit

That if there be any ſuch thing as a

were ever any ſuch men as were good

And yet if nevertheleſs ſuch good and
righteous Perſons have been oftentimes
unjuſtly oppreſſed, and ſometimes have
paſſed away their whole mortal lives,
rack'd, and worryed by the undeſerved
malice of evil men. And then laſtly, if it
be conſidered, how much God himſelf
was concern'd (ſo far as I have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

belief, that God will undertake, at
one time or other ſuch an Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Divine Juſtice, is alledged
from that natural conſcience, and innate
diſpoſition; to fear the doing of (at leaſt)
notorious Acts of Immorality, which
do univerſally and naturally (though in
different degrees) attend the minds of
men. And which muſt either ſignify,
that there is a vindicative hand above,
which will at one time or other return
their wicked Actions upon themſelves
in ſome proportionable puniſhment; or
elſe it muſt be preſum'd, that God gave
them naturally and unavoidably ſuch
a Conſcience only for their Deluſion,
and implanted in them that natural fear,
to be only of ſomething, that may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
(if there ſhould be no other world)
never come to paſs. Which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,

                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42467:31"/>
Now, though ſome men have labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all they can to uſurp upon that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
temper of their minds (whether by
the influence of great examples of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
or by the ſurprizing temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſome mighty preſent advantage;
or upon the flattering hopes of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſecrecy) and may have, for a time,
ſubdued the Authority of their Natural
fear and conſcience: and given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
leave to be engaged in ſome vile
and villainous practices: Yet when they
had once acquir'd their ends by them,
and digeſted the ſucceſs (how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever)
of their unjuſt attempts, they
have been afterwards inwardly arreſted
and attended, with an unaccountable
dread of ſomething (they knew not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
diſtinctly what) that might befal
them for what they had done: Or at
leaſt they have been purſued with ſuch
an uneaſineſs and diſorder of mind, that
they could afford themſelves no true reſt
or contentment, and but a very ſmall
ſatisfaction, in their own rightful, much
leſs, in their unjuſtly acquir'd enjoyments.</p>
                  <p>Now of this ſad and diſmal after-game

for they had every one

with greater Severity than Equity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a certain man to be Beheaded,
who before the ſeparation of his Head

                  <p>Both <hi>Exnerus</hi> and <hi>Lipſius</hi> tell us of

crying out that they were to die innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

                     <hi>Lipſius</hi> gives us a ſtory, from <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus
Schafnaburgenſis,</hi> whom he calls a
famous Writer, and worthy of belief,
of <hi>Burchardus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Halberſtad,</hi> who
entering into an unjuſt controverſy with
the Abbot of <hi>Helverden</hi> about Tithes
in <hi>Saxony,</hi> which he had taken away
from his Monaſtery; &amp; the Abbot finding
no relief from any Judicatory on Earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<hi>Frederick</hi> Count <hi>Palatine</hi> to tell the

for Judgment, and that both of them

the Biſhop; who falling from his horſe,
was heard to say, that he was juſt then
ſnatch'd away to God's Tribunal there to
be Judg'd.</p>
                  <p>To theſe I could have added many
more of this kind, ſuch as the famous
ſtories of the Templar at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> of
<hi>Radulphus</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the like;
but then I muſt have exceeded the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of this Paragraph. Therefore I
ſhall now only take notice of a paſſage
that looks that way in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
And that is of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Caſe
of <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices. It was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
like an appeal to the Juſtice of God,


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42467:36"/>
when for his Juſtification he ſaid;<note place="margin">Num. 16. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32.</note> 
                     <hi>If theſe

if they be viſited after the viſitation of
all men; Then hath not God ſent me.</hi> God
anſwered his Appeal, <hi>For the Earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
and ſwallowed them up quick,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the other former Inſtances,
they may be ſuppos'd to have been acted
from ſudden Efforts of deeply oppreſſed
Paſſions, and not from any known Rules
to licentiate them in thoſe practices, and
ſo the Appealants could not have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
themſelves any aſſurance of thoſe

And therefore it hath been and
ought always to be queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it may be allowable or lawful or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
to imitate the practice of ſuch
appeals. And for this I ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42467:36"/>
in which I have endeavour'd to prove,
that God Almighty will at one time or

Judgment to all Mankind, I ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
make a nearer approach towards
the Concluſion for a Future World's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
upon the account of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
were I not oblig'd to conſider,
whether Almighty God doth not execute
ſuch adminiſtrations of his Juſtice to the
Good and Evil in, and with reſpect to,
this preſent life. And as to that enquiry,
the <hi>Second</hi> Chapter is concern'd.</p>

            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter I am concern'd to
offer to Examination, Whether or
no Almighty GOD doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute,
or permit the Executions on
Juſtice and Judgment to Mankind, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the different Qualifications
of their Lives and Actions, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Life. And this Enquiry will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
three diſtinct Sections deſign'd for
ſeveral debates. In every one of which,
ſomething will be improv'd for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
illuſtrating the Reasſon of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:42467:37"/>
In the firſt Section will be manag'd
the Matter of Fact, and therein it will be
evidenc'd, That the adminiſtrations of
Juſtice and Judgment to the Good and
Evil, is not impartially executed in this
World.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond, will be offer'd to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
what an influence the ſence
of that Omiſſion had, upon the Minds
of the Heathen World.</p>
               <p>In the third, an occaſion will be taken
to offer Reaſons, Why the imperfect
Apprehenſions, that are generally had
of the ſtate of the Dead, and of the
manner of GOD's Management of his
Juſtice in the other World, do not at
all invalidate the belief of it's real Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence,
nor of the certainty of GOD's
making an impartial Completion of his
univerſal Juſtice and Judgment to the
Good and Evil, in that ſtate.</p>

                  <head>Section. I.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt, in this Section I am engaged to
repreſent that univerſal Juſtice is
not impartially done to all Mankind,
according to the different qualifications
of their Lives and Actions in this their
preſent Exiſtence. But if it be alledged,


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42467:37"/>
That the Notoreity of the Fact, and a
more general conſent in the Caſe, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to ſuperſede the offering of any
thing, that is Explanatory to confirm the
Truth of it: My Anſwer is, That as I
can't foreſee what evaſions my attendant
Scepticks may ſuggeſt to elude the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Preſumptives, ſo I am willing (as I
ſhall do all along) to indulge ſuch as
are already Believers, with the cleareſt
explanations of the Caſe; If not the
more fully to aſſure them, yet the more
lively to repreſent to them, the atteſted
Truth of their own Obſervation. And
for that end, I ſhall take leave to trouble
the Common Reader with ſome autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
Teſtimonies. And to avoid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy,
I ſhall produce but two only
of every ſort.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſhall offer the Scriptural ſence
of the caſe, and that only as it's repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by two Prophets of God, who by
their interrogatory manner of ſpeaking,
do more ſtrongly confirm that Matter of
Fact.</p>
                  <p>As, <hi>Why does the way of the Wicked proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, I ſhall ſubjoin the ſence of
two Fathers of the Chriſtian Religion.
The firſt is that of</hi> Athenagoras <hi>the anicent
Apollogiſt. And he undertakes an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the aſſured belief of a future
Judgment, becauſe (ſaith he)</hi> We have ſeen

them here; when others of

Calamities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The next is</hi> Salvian, <hi>who in his Book
of Providence, ſeems to alarm the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's

portion in this Life, than thoſe that are
Wicked?</p>
                  <p>And if my ſceptick Reader, to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
the credit of theſe Authorities, ſhall
object; That ſuch men might be condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
into thoſe affirmations, only to ſerve
the faith of the divine Revelation, for the
Exiſtence of another Life; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(fully to take off that exception)
add the like number of Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
who as poſitively as either of them
have atteſted the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſhall be the ſence of <hi>Cicero,</hi>
(though perhaps he may perſonate <hi>Cotta,</hi>
or ſome other man in ſpeaking it) who
was ſo greatly concern'd in this caſe, that
diſcourſing of the Gods, he ſaith, <hi>That
if they have taken upon themſelves any care
of the world at all, it would be well with the
Good, and otherwiſe with the Evil: But</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>there appears no ſuch thing.</hi>
And then the Philoſopher further ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in an enquiry after it, confirms his
own obſervation, by ſeveral inſtances that
relate to it for it's verification. As when
he ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Cur duos Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piones Poenus oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit? Cur Hannibal Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit? <hi>&amp;c. Nat. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.</hi>

And then proceeds with a Catalogue

Proſperity: and that the Good and Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
may in the mean time, be haraſſed in
the world, without any remarkable inſtances
of Relief or Compenſation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe be the <hi>three</hi> kinds of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which I thought, if not abſolutely
neceſſary, yet very convenient, to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
in this Caſe: For though the matter
of fact be obvious enough, yet our Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
know, that upon its unqueſtionable
conceſſion, the weight of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
depends; and therefore we muſt
not be precarious in the leaſt inſtances of
proof, upon which we Argue.</p>
                  <p>But what ſaith the Heathen world to
all this? or what influence had it upon
their minds? that's now to be examined:

                  <p>IN this ſecond Section, I have obliged
my ſelf to repreſent, what a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
influence, the ordinary omiſſion of
that impartial adminiſtration of God's
juſtice to the good and evil in this life,
had upon the minds of the Heathen World
it ſelf. And the reaſon why I take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to do it in this place, is becauſe
I perceive, that they were eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled
into whatſoever they affirm'd or
doubted, concerning the Exiſtence of a
future ſtate, from an obſervation of the
promiſcuous uſage of the Good and Evil
in this Life.</p>
                  <p>Now, that I may fully diſcharge this
deſign (which will appear ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an improvement of the preſent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument)
at once, I ſhall produce, or point
at ſomething, from the moſt famous
Heathen Philoſophers, with a tranſient
Aſpect upon the general run of the Poets,
as to the caſe in hand.</p>
                  <p>Firſt as to the Heathen Philoſophers,
I ſhall not here take any notice of the
Sence of <hi>Plato,</hi> or his Followers; or of
what they and ſome others have affirm'd
concerning <hi>Socrates</hi> in that caſe. But I


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42467:40"/>
ſhall only make uſe of ſome ſuch Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
(and of thoſe the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable)
as lived ſince our Saviour's
time; it being preſum'd that they ſhould
maintain an oppoſition to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of a future World, in pure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
to Chriſtianity; and that becauſe
the profeſſors of it had ſo poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that ſtate, and the iſſues of it,
as its principally rational Fundamental
of all their vertuous Practices, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Sufferings.</p>
                  <p>Now, it will appear, that as thoſe
Philoſophers could not eſcape the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of God's ordinary omiſſion of
his impartial juſtice to the Good and
Evil in this life, ſo as oft as that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
came intentively into their
minds, it ſo ſtagger'd them in their
Atheiſtical Hypotheſis concerning a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
World, that ſometimes they were
neceſſitated to admit the thoughts of it,
though (as <hi>Minutius Foelix</hi> obſerves, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiata
fide)</hi> but with a half-way, or
doubtful Faith.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of that ſort, of whom I ſhall
take notice, ſhall be <hi>Seneca,</hi> who lived
not many years after our Saviour's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
and was Tutor to <hi>Nero,</hi> and
whoſe Authority goes a great way with
our modern Theiſts. He indeed expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42467:40"/>
himſelf very frequently with a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
denial of any future World at all.
As when he ſaid, <hi>To die, was not to be
at all: And that there

                     <note place="margin">Mors eſt non eſſe. Hoc erit poſt me, quod ante fuit—nos quoque accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimur, &amp; extinguimur. <hi>Epiſt. ad Luc.</hi>

                     <hi>as there was before me:

be the ſame ſtate with us after our death,
as it was before we were born. <hi>And in


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42467:41"/>
his tract of Superſtition, he attributes
the fear and apprehenſion of future Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
to that cauſe; and he there
tells us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

and ſuggeſts fears,

over all the Evils of this

more after death, which ſhall never have
an end.</p>
                  <p>All this the Philoſopher imputes to
vain and needleſſ Superſtition, as he doth
in that tract very many ridiculous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions.
But nevertheleſs, though he
had ſo often expreſſed his willingneſs to
disbelieve a future World, yet to ſhew
how impoſſible it was for him altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to blot out of his mind the thoughts
of it, and how improbable it was to him,
that the Good and Juſt, after all their
purſuits of Vertue, and the pious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of their Time and Beings,
ſhould find no other recompence, but
Annihilation: I ſay, When he was to
comfort <hi>Apollonius</hi> for the Death of his
Son, (whom he had commended for his
Modeſty and Piety, towards the Gods,
his Parents, and Friends, and for his
Vertuous Life) he could then tell him,

                     </gap>) was very likely
to be ſo; that is, That <hi>after their death
they ſhall attain to Honour

                     <hi>That
then he ought to hope well
of his Son, that he now
dwells with the Souls of

that happy ſtate. And
then he careſſeth him with
what</hi> Pindar <hi>ſpake of the Dead, and with
what</hi> Plato <hi>had diſcours'd of the Souls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, what ſhall we think of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
and honeſty of this Great man,
(who could affirm of himſelf, That he
had rather <hi>Plutarch</hi> were not <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
than that <hi>Plutarch</hi> were not vertuous)
in the managery of his Comfort to
<hi>Apollonius,</hi> Did he believe another
World's Exiſtence, or no? If he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, with what Integrity could he

If he did not believe it, Why did
he deal ſo inſincerely with <hi>Apollonius,</hi>
as to put him upon ſuch a deluſive
hope in his diſtreſs? Or, if it be ſaid, that
<hi>Apollonius</hi> perhaps might have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
affected with what <hi>Pindar</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi>


                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:42467:42"/>
had ſaid, about a future World, but then
Why did he not reprove him for his
Folly, in buſying his Head with ſuch
<hi>Romantick</hi> Dreams, and not rather direct
him to that ſolid comfort, which a <hi>Stoick</hi>'s
Reaſon (as is pretended) might have
afforded him? Or, Laſtly, If to ſolve all
this, it may be ſuggeſted, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he had ſaid, he indeed might doubt
of that States Exiſtence, I have ſo far
attained my End, as that I can inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret,
That he doubted of that ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he could not avoid the force of
this and other Arguments, that ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
demonſtrated it to his mind, in
deſpight of all his Reſolution to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the contrary againſt the Chriſtian
Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>To theſe I may add ſomething very
conſiderable from the Famous Emperor
<hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> who alwaies ſpake
very confuſedly of what ſhould become
of men, when they die: As once he did
concerning <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Muliteer,
that they ſhould be reduc'd (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>)
to ſomething, he could not tell what;


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42467:43"/>
that is, that they either ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the ſame
Principles whence they
came,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>. Lib. 6. Sect. 24.</note> or be diſpers'd into
Atomes: Yet when he
came afterward to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that the gods had done all things
elſe ſo orderly, and with ſuch ſingular
Love to Mankind, he wonder'd at their
neglect of one thing; that is, that they
ſhould take no Care, that Men, who had
held ſuch correſpondencies with them by
pious Actions and Sacred Miniſtrations,
ſhould, when they die, be no more,
and be wholly extinguiſhed. I ſay, at
this Block he ſtumbled, and would be
offering ſome Reaſons for it, but ſuch as
were hypothetical and uncertain; and
therefore begins with a
(<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>How can it be?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c. Lib. 12. Sect. 5. Gat. p. 117.</note>
or, <hi>How comes it to paſs
that it ſhould be ſo?</hi> &amp;c.
And it's enough for my purpoſe, that
I have attain'd this from that excellent
Philoſopher.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have repreſented how thoſe
Philoſophers (by whoſe, if by any
kind of Authority, our preſent Scepticks


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42467:43"/>
muſt pretend to Patronize their Atheiſm)
who lived after Chriſtianity was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the World, were neceſſitated to
behave themſelves in the caſe of a future
ſtate: Which had they poſitively main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
and publiſhed, coincidently with
the Chriſtian Faith, they foreſaw, that
they muſt have disbanded the greateſt
part of thoſe their credulous Followers,
who were then perſwaded to oppoſe it.
And that becauſe thoſe Philoſophers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
that all the Practicks of the
Chriſtian Religion were ſo conſonant to,
and perfective of, right reaſon; ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
to the Safety of all Societies, and
that did oblige its Profeſſors to be, upon
that main reaſon, ſo vertuous and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
that it was neceſſary they ſhould
make them ridiculous in truſting to a
future reward and happineſs, (which
they deſigned to laugh at, as fond and
ſuperſtitious) whom they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
to the World, as ſcandalous and
offenſive in their morals and practices.</p>
                  <p>And this their halting and ſhuffling
in a matter of that importance, ſeems
to me a greater Argument to confirm
the credibility of another World's Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
on this account, than if I had ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Thouſand Authorities of ſuch Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
as poſitively believed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42467:44"/>
it; becauſe thence it appears, that
the reaſon of the thing was ſo prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
convincing, that it controuled
their minds (as it were, whether they
would or no) ſometimes into a ſerious
doubt, at other times into a ſeeming
conceſſion; though they were fain to
retract it, as oft as the intereſt of their
cauſe, and their oppoſition to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
exacted it from them.</p>
                  <p>And now having diſpatch'd the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
or theſe ſome famous ones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of them all, I could have added
many and great Authorities to our Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
from the Heathen Hiſtorians,
though of a more ancient Date, ſuch as
one from the famous Death-bed Speech
of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to his Sons, in <hi>Xenophon;</hi> And
of <hi>Veturia's</hi> Oration to her Son <hi>Martius,</hi>
to be Merciful to the City of the <hi>Volſi,</hi>
Recorded by <hi>Dionyſius Halicarneſſeus.</hi>
But I omit the uſe that may be made
of them, as unneceſſary.</p>
                  <p>And then as to the Heathen Poets,
(by whoſe Works the Ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
natural Theology, and indeed
moſt kinds of Learning were ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
preſerv'd) it's obvious enough,
how poſitively they declar'd their
thoughts of a future World's Exiſtence,
and what apprehenſions they had of the


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42467:44"/>
Rewards and Puniſhments of another
Life, upon the account of the unequal
Diſtributions in this World, to the Good
and Evil. And for that purpoſe they
deſcribed the Rewards of the Vertuous,
by an <hi>Elizium;</hi> That is, by certain
pleaſant Fields, fitted for all advantages
of Pleaſure and Happineſs. And thus
they did, as to the Puniſhment of the
Wicked, by a great many inſtances of
dreadful Repreſentations: As by ſuch
frightful Officers, grim Judges, and by
ſome particular Examples of ſeveral ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
puniſhments, ſuch as of <hi>Tantalus,
Ixion, Siſiphus,</hi> and <hi>Titius.</hi> And this
ingenious way of repreſenting the ſtate
of the Dead, was ſo ancient, that <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus
Siculus</hi> affirms,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 4.</note> That <hi>Orpheus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it from the old <hi>Egyptians.</hi> But
the general Run of the Poets is ſo well
known to abett our deſign, that it were
an inexcuſable redundancy, to offer at
a citation of their innumerable Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to our purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>And thus having made uſe of theſe
few inſtances of the Heathen World's
Opinions, concerning a future Life upon
the account of this Argument; let no
man think that I deſign to approve or
anſwer for all the imperfect Notions,
or doubtful Repreſentations, which many


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42467:45"/>
of thoſe Philoſophers (ſuch as <hi>Plato</hi>
and his Followers eſpecially) that aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Being of a Future ſtate, had of
the manner of the Soul's Exiſtence in
it: Much leſs do I intend to account
for the Luſory and extravagant Fancies
concerning the modell'd circumſtances
of that State: But ſo long as it appears,
That upon ſome natural convincing
Reaſons, and eſpecially upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the promiſcuous uſage of the
Good and Evil in this World, nothing
could ſo ſolve the difficulties of ſuch
Obſervations, but that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to admit the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Future World, I have, as far
as I deſign'd in this caſe, attain'd my
End.</p>
                  <p>And now, if any Sceptical Theiſt
ſhould go about to perplex this way of
Arguing, and ſhall alledge, That the
confus'd and unaccountable Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
which thoſe Learned Heathens
had of the manner, place, and other
circumſtances of Mens Exiſtence in that
State, and how the Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
are there to be executed to the
Good and Evil: And then to ſtrengthen
their Exception, ſhould object to us,
That the Chriſtians themſelves, who
pretend the greateſt aſſurance of the


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42467:45"/>
                     <hi>Future World's Exiſtence,</hi> have expreſs'd
almoſt as imperfect an underſtanding
of thoſe mention'd Caſes and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of that Future World; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
have diſcours'd as wildly of the
ſtate of the Dead, as others had done;
And then, that their Great Apoſtle
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould affirm, That the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of thoſe future Events,<note place="margin">

as by a Riddle, at the meaning of which
men, were left to gueſs; or, like one
that ſees through the imperfect <hi>medium</hi>
of a Latteſs: I ſay, if by theſe Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
ſuch a Sceptick ſhould encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
his Denial or Suſpicion of the
Reality of ſuch a World's Exiſtence;
My anſwer to ſuch an Exception ſhall
be manag'd in the next Section by its
ſelf, in which I ſhall offer Reaſons, why
God was pleas'd, that there ſhould be
ſuch an imperfect knowledge, or ſuch a
concealment of the manner, place, and
other circumſtances of the ſtate of the
Dead in another World. And this I do
the rather take care to explain, becauſe
it's probable, that even a Believer may
ſometimes ſtumble at the difficulty of
that Solution.</p>

                  <head>Section III.</head>
                  <p>IN this Section, I ſhall therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to repreſent, That mens imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge of the ſtate of the Dead,
that is, of the place, manner, and other
the preciſe circumſtances of that State,
and eſpecially of the way and method of
God's diſpoſure of Mankind to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Rewards and Puniſhments in the
other World, are no reaſonable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to ſuſpect the reality of them, and
much leſs of the State it ſelf, in which they
are to be Adminiſtred.</p>
                  <p>And this I ſhall do by way of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to a Cavillers exception, and it ſhall
be thus laid. Saith he, I have no mind to
be impos'd upon by a pretence of ſuch
Encouragements, as are ſo preſumptively
and generally, and therefore, obſcurely,
propos'd; nor be oblig'd to a Religion for
an end, of the particular manner of whoſe
enjoyment, I can have no explicit under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and of which no man can give
any ſufficient demonſtration to my mind
and reaſon. I can't thus anſwer the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of my friends, nor ſolve my
diſcretion to my ſelf, for living ſuch


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42467:46"/>
a ſtrict and ſelf-denying Life. That is,
that when I come to die, I can't convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly
tell my ſelf, or them, whither I
ſhall go, or what ſhall then become of
me; ſo that if I can receive no better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of thoſe Future Events, I am like
to live as pleaſes my ſelf at preſent, and to
adhere to thoſe thoughts, that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
my ſuſpicion of any Real Exiſtence
of another World at all.</p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to this exception thus laid,
though ſome men, whoſe minds are firmly
ſetled in the Faith of what is neceſſary
to be believ'd concering another World,
would chuſe to leave ſuch perſons in their
incredulity, as if there were nothing in
Rational Evidence to controul their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
yet I hope I have ſomething to
offer in this hard caſe, that may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
perſwade, if not abſolutely convince
them, out of the Errour of their own ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion.
And I ſhall attempt it upon the
account of theſe two Reaſons. The Firſt
ſhall be with reſpect to the preſent State
of humane underſtandings. The ſecond
upon a moral reaſonableneſs of Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting,
that the manner and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of that Future State, ſhould be ſo dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repreſented, and imperfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Reaſon that I ſhall offer, is,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42467:47"/>
becauſe we may preſume, that mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
Faculties are not at preſent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of admitting a direct apprehenſion,
or repreſentation of objects, that are by
their ſublimity of a different Kind and
Nature. And the Reaſon is, becauſe thoſe
Faculties, at preſent, are ty'd down to ſo
many reſtraints, and limitations. As Firſt,
by their natural dependance upon the
outward Senſes, which muſt firſt intromit
thoſe and all other Notices, before the
Mind can manage its Conceptions of
things. And then Secondly, becauſe the
groſneſs of thoſe Corporal Organs, by
which men naturally Act their intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Powers, doth render the mind too dull
and unfit, to entertain ſuch unaccommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
and diſproportion'd Objects, and
notices of things, eſpecially that are at
ſuch diſtances of Place, and Time.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it's poſſible our Caſe, as
to the preſent underſtanding of that State,
and of the nature of thoſe Divine and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Diſpenſations
in another World, if
they were never ſo well diſcours'd to us
by the beſt Reaſon, and the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Revelation, may be like to
the mans that is born Blind in reſpect of
Light, who can never be made to frame
a right conception of it in his mind, by
all the definitions and deſcriptions, that


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42467:47"/>
can be made of it to him. For if he be
told, that it comes from a body, that is
ſeemingly not above a foot and half Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter,
and yet notwithſtanding, that
it gives Luſter, Heat, and Life to all the
viſible World; or ſuppoſe that a man
ſhould make uſe of any other glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations
of its Nature and Qualities, they
would but amuſe and confound the blind
mans mind, and perhaps he would think,
that the perſon came on purpoſe to abuſe
him. But then ſuppoſe that blind mans Eyes
to be opened at an inſtant, he can then be
preſently ſatisfyed with a right concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it. Now it's as unreaſonable to doubt
of a Future State, becauſe we can have
nothing in our preſent Conceptions, that
anſwers to it, as it's impertinent for a
blind man to disbelieve the Exiſtence of
Light, becauſe he can never be able by all
the diſcourſes that are made of it to him,
to frame a right Notion of it in his mind.</p>
                  <p>And further, if this objection were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
and ſhould ſucceed, our Sceptick,
might as well on that ground, take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to queſtion the very Exiſtence
of God himſelf; becauſe he doth not
offer his Nature to the Knowledge of
his Creatures by any direct tender of
it to the apprehenſion of their Senſes,
when by the common reaſon of mankind


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42467:48"/>
(upon the acknowledgment of His Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Being, which none that conſiders the
Exiſtence of the World, can poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt)
he muſt always be believ'd to be
as near us as the Objects which we see or
touch. A notion of His abſolute Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
can admit no leſs.</p>
                  <p>But theſe men ſhould be diſcours'd a
little further on that account, and asked,
whether they do not believe, that there
be innumerable things in Real Being,
which they can't directly and ſenſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
and apprehend, becauſe perhaps they
are too fine, or too abſtruſe, or in other
reſpects diſproportion'd to their preſent
Senſes, and for that reaſon the natures of
ſuch Beings, could never come into any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
cogniſance? or do they not think,
that there be <hi>thouſands</hi> of other Beings,
that are in ken of ſenſible perception, and
have come under Philoſophical diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and yet the moſt diligent enquirers
into their Exiſtencies, have been ſenſible
how much they have faln ſhort of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge of the Natures of moſt
of them? and are there not as many
extraordinary <hi>Phoenomenas,</hi> or manifeſt
appearances in nature, that are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
obſerv'd cauſations, and yet are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to be true, though how they are,
or ſhould be ſo effected, they cannot, with


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42467:48"/>
all their skill and induſtry, find out?
Of this nature I account, eſpecially Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts,
and Apparitions; of whoſe Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtences
we may be perfectly ſatisfied, by
as plain and notorious matters of fact and
teſtimonies, as by which any thing in the
world was ever made any ways ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
credible. And now if becauſe ſome
inſtances of that kind have been acted by
knavery, and more of them ſuggeſted by
fear, whereby the real facts have been
ſometimes put out of credit and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
If I ſay, for thoſe reaſons my ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
may take occaſion to deride my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of ſuch things in this place, I
ſhall admit his Scoff with ſo much the leſs
diſſatisfaction, as that with me, he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the univerſal Wiſdom of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
And I challenge him to ſhew me
any learned Age or Nation in the world,
to whoſe general Opinion I may not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
appeal in this Caſe; only always
excepted, that in every Age there might
be here and there, perhaps one or two
(ſuch an one as <hi>Diagoras</hi> was among the
<hi>Athenians)</hi> who might in a dogmatizing
humour be ſingularly promoting their
private Opinions againſt the binding Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Common Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the matter in hand, if the
unequal diſtributions of Juſtice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42467:49"/>
of Rewards and Puniſhments to the
Good and Evil in this Life will inforce the
reaſon of men to aſſent to the belief in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
that there muſt needs be another
World to follow, wherein a Just and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God will allow all his Creatures (that
are capable of it) Impartial Right &amp; Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
why ſhould any man quit his faith
of that State, though his ſenſes at preſent,
cannot give, or his underſtanding admit
any direct information of the Manner,
Meaſures, Place, and the other Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of its Exiſtence, becauſe they cannot; or
becauſe for good reaſons they ought not?
And if ſome men, to cure this Scruple, have
been too buſy and poſitive in their deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of the State of the Dead, I think
ſuch adventurous Conjectures have not
at all added to the evidence for the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility
of a Future World; but, on the
contrary, they have contributed a great
advantage to them, that have a deſign to
call in queſtion, and to deride the whole
Faith of that State. Such kind of addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to an Article, being like to the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the Author's Wit and Invention
in a Serious Hiſtory, which may reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
bring in queſtion the credit of all
its relations; or like the commendations
of a vertuous Perſon to exceſs, which may
make a ſuſpicion of Flattery in the whole


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42467:49"/>
Encomium: An Article, like a man, may
be ſo impos'd upon by a dreſs, that the
knowledge and belief of it may be loſt in
the diſguiſe. This the Firſt Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>My Second Anſwer to our Captious
Scepticks exception, is, That as it's certain
that we have not faculties in this mortal
State, that are figur'd and fitted for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and ſenſible perception of ſuch diſtant
and unaccommodated Objects; ſo the
moral Reaſon why GOD Almighty
might be pleaſed, that there ſhould be
ſuch a concealment of them, may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
that if that ſtate, and all that is
enjoyable in it, were in all points and
circumſtances made cognizable to us
in ſuch a manner as ſenſible repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
can make any thing to be, tho'
ſuch a kind of knowledge of them,
might poſſibly ſatisfy ſome Mens curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities,
yet it would be a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
hinderance to mens living vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and religious Lives with reference
to their future Intereſt. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, becauſe they being plac'd here to
act, as in a ſtate of trial and probation, for
that future Reward and Happineſs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition of living ſuch kinds of
Lives; if ſuch a ſenſible notice, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
conception of the meaſures, and
manner of all the particular Inſtances


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42467:50"/>
of that Future Happineſs, were allowed
them in this Life, ſuch a Diſcovery
would probably over-balance their
Souls equally poized Liberty (which
can only conſiſt with the notion of their
being probationers) too much on the
one hand or ſide. That is, it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
it too much towards a neceſſity of
acting its vertuous Purpoſes. To which
neceſſity, every approach of the Mind
(whenceſoever it proceeds) would take
away ſo much of the reaſon of all Good
Actions being accountably rewardable.
But of this more in my Third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And now if it ſhould be ſaid againſt
this, that indeed if men were put into
any enjoyment of the happineſs of that
Future State, it might take off that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of acting, and incline the Will
too much on the one ſide of the Scale
of its natural Liberty, and preponderate
the Mind too much towards that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
State, which it ſhall enjoy in the
other World; but this (ſaith our Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick)
is only a preſent particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that Future Happineſs, and 'tis
no more, that I enquire after.</p>
                  <p>To this I reply, That ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
would be a kind of enjoyment in
its ſelf, eſpecially, if it be conſidered


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42467:50"/>
(as reaſonably it ought) that the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
part of man (by which he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially
is, and acts himſelf) will be
moſt principally concern'd in the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Future Bliſs; when the
Judgment and the Will ſhall be freely
determin'd (that is, determine themſelves)
to the Embraces of that mighty Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And therefore, tho' the Bleſſed ſhall for
ever unconſtrainedly chooſe to ſerve God,
and to do all the Good they can in that
ſtate (&amp; there may be occaſions for it more
than we can conceive) yet I think that
thoſe their vertuous Actions ſhall not
then be made ſo Rewardable, as when
they were acted in a ſtate of Probation,
upon an equal poize of chuſing Good
or Evil at their own Election; but will
be rather a part of their Joy, Bliſs, and
Fruition. This the Second Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>And now having thus ſolv'd this grand
Objection, I hope there is nothing more
to be alledged to put any further ſtop in
our way, but that we may fairly proceed
to ſhew, how far the reſpiting and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing
of univerſal Juſtice to a future
World, will adminiſter new Reaſons
for a ſtronger demonſtration of a future

               <p>IN this Chapter, that the Argument
may be found to be of ſufficient
validity to attain its End, I ſhall
endeavour to demonſtrate, That
GOD's reſpiting and adjourning the
Completion of his judicial adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to a future World, is ſo naturally rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
that nothing elſe can ſolve the
apprehenſions we may have of GOD's
Deſign, to preſerve the preſent univerſe
in that natural order in which by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it was at firſt fitted to ſubſiſt: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can any other expedient ſecure a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that GOD intended a regard to the
Good and Happineſs of Mankind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as ſocially, or individually conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>But here be ſeveral things, which
muſt be diſtinctly and apart conſidered,
in ſo many Sections by themſelves.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Section, it muſt be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
how that part of the univerſe, which
conſiſts of neceſſary Agents can other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be preſerv'd, in its natural Order.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond, we ſhall examine the
caſe, by that part of the univerſe, that
acts in it as rational Agents; and firſt,


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42467:51"/>
as they are to enjoy their Well-being
in ſocial Communions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and Fourthly, we ſhall offer
to examination, how otherwiſe GOD's
care of Mankind may be acquitted, as
they are individually to be conſidered.
And that particularly, as they may be
diſtinguiſhed into the two ſorts of Evil
and Good.</p>
               <p>In all which reſpects, there will appear
cogent Reaſons, Why Almighty GOD
ſhould adjourn the completion of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
adminiſtrations of Juſtice and

                  <head>Section I.</head>
                  <p>IN this Section I am concern'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent,
That if Almighty GOD
ſhould not reſpit the completion of
his judiciary purpoſes for the Good and
Evil to another Life, but ſhould in this
world be univerſally and actually juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and abetting every righteous Perſon
and Cauſe; and ſhould alſo as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
be conſtantly correcting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
every Evil Mans unjuſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
it would certainly diſcontinue the
natural order of thoſe Agents, that act
by neceſſary impulſe, as often as they


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42467:52"/>
ſhould be made uſe of for thoſe judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
executions. And that becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſubſerve an extraordinary proceedure
of the Divine Juſtice, unleſs they ſhould
be continually interrupted in the order
of their natural Cauſations and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>And to make this Obſervation the
more convincingly conſpicuous, we
may take meaſures by ſome few famous
Caſes, in which, GOD was ſometimes
pleas'd to exerciſe his abſolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and extraordinary Authority over
thoſe neceſſary Agents, for the preſent
executions of his Juſtice. That is, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that all the Seas and Rivers of the
Univerſe ſhould be forced from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Courſes (of which there be ſome
inſtances) to fourd over all thoſe good
Perſons in their flight from an Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as oft as there were no other
means for their eſcape, and that the Sun
ſhould as oft ſtand ſtill, as it were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſary
it ſhould, to crown a good Cauſe
with a compleat Conqueſt; or ſuppoſe,
that as often as any man were ready to
periſh with Thirſt, every hard Rock or
natural mound to Waters, ſhould be
forc'd open for a River to run in dry
places, to ſupply their preſent want; or
that the Clouds ſhould ſuſpend their


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42467:52"/>
kind ſhowers to refreſh the growth of
Plants; or that the Sun's enlivening
warmth ſhould be turn'd into a Flame
to burn up the ſurface of the Earth, ſo oft
as the Inhabitants thereof ſhould deſerve
thoſe inſtances of the Divine Judgment
upon them: I ſay, if theſe, and a thouſand
ſuch like caſes as theſe, ſhould ſo often
become neceſſary for the completion of
GOD's Favour to the Vertuous and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and for the juſt execution of His
Diſpleaſure to wicked Men in this world,
the neceſſary Agents, which were natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpoſed to ſerve the neceſſities &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
of Mankind, would be found to
act contradictions to their own Natures;
and their orderly Cauſations would be
ſo daily and hourly chang'd into miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Events, that the Univerſe it ſelf
would appear to be nothing elſe, but a
ſcene of Prodigies, to amuſe and affright
Mankind.</p>
                  <p>Now, though ſuch wonderful executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Divine Juſtice, and eſpecial
Favour, may well enough conſiſt with
the world's preſent created order, when
they are ſo unfrequently done, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome extraordinary occaſions, yet if
they were conſtantly and fully acted,
for the completion of every ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
reward or puniſhment (which muſt


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42467:53"/>
be ſuppoſed, if the Arguments in my
firſt Chapter, that GOD will certainly
do it at one time or other, be true) the
neceſſary Beings, which ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
to thoſe ends and executions,
muſt be ſo often interrupted in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
motions and cauſations, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would follow, but the World's
univerſal Diſorder, if not its total Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps, things may go better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Rational Agents. But that is
next to be inquir'd into. Therefore,</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>Section II.</head>
                  <p>IN this <hi>Second</hi> Section, we are engaged
to examine the next grand inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and diſorder to the univerſe, as God
by his own Sovereign Wiſdom ſtated it,
with reſpect to that part of it, which are
call'd Rational and Voluntary Agents, as
they are naturally and neceſſarily to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
together in Social Communions one
with another for their common welfare.
And then I ſay, that if God Almighty
ſhould in this life univerſally execute thoſe
adminiſtrations of Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the Good and Evil, it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the ordinary good ſubſiſtence of all


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42467:53"/>
humane Societies. For if while the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
of Gods providence are ſo promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuouſly
diſpenced to the Good and Evil,
whereby they do ſo conſtantly ſhare in
one anothers bleſſings and miſfortunes,
Mankind do attain the good ends of their
Social Subſiſtence with ſo much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and hazard, as that in a <hi>thouſand</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
it had been better, in that very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
for innumerable ſingle perſons
never to have known what a world had
meant, what diſorders, and croſs accidents,
what perpetual diſſolutions of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and fruſtrations of the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
contracts, and agreed proceedings in
Common Affairs, what calamitous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
in all manner of Societies, from
an Empire to a Family, muſt neceſſarily
ſucceed? in ſo much that the World of
Rational Beings, would preſently become
the only confuſed rout of Creatures that
ever God made; and the Exiſtence of the
meaneſt Animal were rather to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
than to enjoy a Being amongſt them:
All which inconveniencies, nothing but a
reſpiting the Completion of God's Juſtice
to a Future World, can poſſibly prevent.</p>
                  <p>And now I appeal to any Theiſtical
mind to tell me, Whence can all this be? or
how ſhould the underſtanding of man,
upon ſuch a proſpect of things, conjecture,


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42467:54"/>
that God ſhould at firſt make a world of
Rational Beings, naturally ſubject to ſo
many oppreſſions, and unjuſt uſages one
from another, and that yet, when they
happen (as they daily do in all places of
the world) they ſhould not poſſibly be
univerſally redreſs'd, without a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
inconvenience to, if not, with a certain
ruin of all their preſent Societies, (in which
it is naturally neceſſary they ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt)
but from a deſign of making an
univerſal after-view of all the Actions of
Men at a time, when all ſuch mix'd ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
ſhall have their irrevocable periods,
and that the good and evil ſhall be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
to their ſeveral diſtinct communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and apartments by themſelves?</p>
                  <p>And by this obſervation will our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
parabolical repreſentations of the
preſent State of Mankind,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 29, 49.</note> appear highly
reaſonable. That is, That the Wheat and
Tares (by which is meant the Good and
Evil) ſhould grow together, till the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,
leaſt a preſent plucking up of the
one ſhould endanger the Succeſs, if not
the very being of the other; and that
the good and bad Fiſh ſhould both of
them be promiſcuouſly comprehended,
not only in the ſame Sea of the World,
but in the ſame net of the Church toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Now let the Hectorers down of


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42467:54"/>
the beleif of another world aſſign me a
conjecture for any other reaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
how to ſolve this doubt, and I
ſhall then renounce the uſe that may be
made of this obſervation for the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Exiſtence of another world.</p>
                  <p>But to all this, if an exception ſhould
be interpos'd from the ſenſe of them, that
are true believers; who (ſaith our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viller)
will be apt ſay, that if God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
doth for the moſt part reſpit the
the executions of Juſtice and Judgment to
a Future World, the apprehenſion of ſuch
a ſuſpenſion would take away a great deal
of the reaſon and incouragement, why
good men ſhould ſo conſtantly pray (as
'tis done in publick Litanies and private
Devotions) for their own Juſtifications,
and the common deliverances of the
Church from its implacable Enemies.
And therefore were it not better, and
more reaſonable for ſuch good men to
ſit down in a patient acquieſcence than
to be ſo ſolicitous in their prayers for
that which (as the Second Chapter hath
aſſur'd us) doth ſo uncommonly, and
uncertainly come to paſs.</p>
                  <p>My anſwer to this exception, is, that
all prayers of that nature, as for all other
temporal bleſſings, are ſuppos'd to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
made interpretatively, if not in direct


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42467:55"/>
words, upon ſome conditions, and terms
of limitation. And of thoſe conditions there
be two eſpecially to be conſider'd.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Good men, ſo often as they
ſupplicate to be delivered and juſtify'd,
or any other way bleſſed in this World,
do alwaies deſire thoſe Mercies at the
Hand of God, upon a condition, that
they may conſiſt with the common
Good and Safety of thoſe publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
in whoſe communions they enjoy
their preſent Subſiſtence. That is, they
deſire not, that their private Satiſfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Vindications, ſhould be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
at the rate of common Ruin,
or upon the terms of any deſtructive
alterations of the communions in which
they live. And that might be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 17.</note>
why <hi>David</hi> deſired that the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God might rather fall upon
himſelf and Family, than upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in general.</p>
                  <p>And as Good men would not enjoy
their particular Exemptions from Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
in exchange for a common
Diſturbance or Miſchief; ſo, nor would
they deſire their Perſonal Juſtifications,
as to their private Enemies, if they
muſt be had upon terms, which muſt
inferr either their preſent, or their future
Ruin: Leſt a Thought of Revenge ſhould


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42467:55"/>
tempt their innocent minds to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
in their Enemies miſfortunes.</p>
                  <p>And therefore that Saying, <hi>(fiat juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
ruat mundus) Let Juſtice be done,
though the whole World ſhould periſh,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be true Divinity, unleſs the meaning
of it be, Let the World periſh, rather
than any man ſhould do what is unjuſt;
but it is falſe to deſire it ſhould periſh,
rather than ſuffer what is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
                  <p>And that you have the firſt condition
upon which a Good mans Prayers are
ſuppos'd to be made, when he implores
the preſent vindication of his Right and
Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That when Good
men pray to God for the preſent deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances
and juſtifications of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Cauſes, they have alwaies ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
condition in reſerve; that is, That
God would grant their Petitions for their
deliverances, unleſs a continuance in their
Sufferings ſhould tend more to their
preſent and future Good, otherwiſe they
can interpret and believe, that it is a
mercy of God to have their Prayers in
ſuch caſes deny'd. And therefore, when
they perceive that their Petitions are in
ſuch inſtances rejected, they are ready
with all ſubmiſſion and contentment of


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42467:56"/>
mind, to think and ſay, that, Had they
not ſome way or other needed their
implacable Enemies ſucceſs, their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
had certainly prevented it: And that
there was ſomething defective in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which God thought fit in that
manner to correct, in order to their own
final Good and Happineſs, or ſuch an
event had never faln out, ſo contrary
to their Supplications.</p>
                  <p>And thus by ſuch wiſe and pious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
they can reaſonably ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
when they meet a diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their expectations of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Bleſſings, after they had prayed for
them, and were deny'd.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, and ſuch as theſe, are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
upon which Good men pray for
Temporal Deliverances, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Juſtifications. And, as ſuch Prayers
are ſufficiently conſiſtent with a Belief
of God's reſpiting and adjourning the
compleat executions of his juſtice to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, ſo it's encouragement enough
(and ſure it's all that need be given)
that when thoſe conditions will bear it,
Good men may aſſure themſelves, that
God will not, nor did ever fail to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
their Petitions, and grant their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.
And this perfectly ſolves the
Sence of our Saviour's indefinite Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42467:56"/>
with reſpect to Temporal Mercies,
that <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall ask the Father
in my name,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 14. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>he will give it you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And further, it's to be conſider'd in
that caſe, That when the reaſon of
thoſe Conditions hath interven'd between
God and his Petitioners, though they
have been denied their Supplications in
kind, yet, for their encouragement ſtill
to pray, they might and ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that God would grant them in
ſome other equivalent matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
for a compenſation of all they
ask'd, and were denied. Howſoever, in
the mean time they can ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that they have been doing their
Duties, and paying the daily Homage
they owed to God, and may live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
under the expectation, that God
will do them right in another World.</p>
                  <p>And, let it now be alſo eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd,
that what I have here ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Conditions upon which Good men
pray for their Temporal Deliverances
and Vindications; and upon the reaſon
of which they are ſo often denied their
Petitions, may hold good alſo in the
caſe of God's executing his Juſtice, as
to the Rewards and Puniſhments of this
Life: That is, That that God will ſo
often act thoſe meaſures of Providence,


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42467:57"/>
as the reaſons of thoſe two mention'd
Conditions will admit it. That is, when
it may be done; Firſt, without bringing
any common deſtruction to thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions,
by which the World ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubſiſts; and, Secondly, when ſuch a
preſent execution of his Juſtice ſhall on
any account tend moſt to the concern'd
perſon's preſent or future Good and
Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>But in all other caſes, where the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of theſe two Conditions are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded,
the executions of the Divine Love
and Juſtice to the Good and Evil, are
ſo often reſerv'd and reſpited, for his
impartial retributions in another World.</p>
                  <p>Now, as this Obſervation may inable
us to think, that there be no ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Caſes, that are ſo reſerved and
reſpited, ſo it will eaſily, and very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
ſolve thoſe mens doubts and
enquiries, Why either all thoſe Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not univerſally done in this
Life; or why there ſhould be any part
of them certainly effected; that is, why
there ſhould be alwaies ſo many, and
ſometimes ſuch remarkable Examples
and Inſtances of God's juſtifying the
Perſons and Cauſes of Good men, and of
his baffling the unjuſt Intereſts and
Dealings of the Evil in this World. Of


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42467:57"/>
which, as there will be alwaies ſo many,
as may be enough to controul the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
of the Epicureans, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Atheiſts, That God takes no care of
the World at all; ſo there may be alſo
few enough to ſuppreſs &amp; ſilence the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs
of thoſe mens too-forward minds
and haſty deſires, who, upon a bare poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and ſome rare Examples of God's
executing his Juſtice viſibly in this Life,
have been apt to raiſe their expectations
even to a criminal diſcontent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
of their own preſent recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
and juſtifications. When they
ought to have conſidered the reaſons of
the former conditions, (as alſo what
other reaſons God may give himſelf,
which we (perhaps) can't underſtand)
upon which they are ſo often omitted,
and ſhould rather have endeavoured to
wait with patience, till the ſeaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth,
in which there ſhall be an
impartial execution of Juſtice to the
whole World of Good and Evil.</p>
                  <p>And this finiſheth the ſecond Section
or Reaſon, that may be given, why God
is pleaſed ſo obſervedly to deferr the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
of his impartial Juſtice to the
Good and Evil to a future World, with
reſpect to Mankind in general, as they
are ordinarily to ſubſiſt in Social Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions.


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42467:58"/>
But, beſides this Social Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of Mankind, there was ſomewhat
offer'd, as to God's care of them in
other reſpects. Therefore,</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>Section III.</head>
                  <p>IN theſe two remaining Sections I am
concerned to repreſent the caſe more
particularly, as Mankind may be divided
into the two ſorts of Evil and Good; and
as God's juſt and gracious care of them
both, as ſo diſtinctly and apart conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
may be ſufficiently acquitted by
reaſonable and religious Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Now, this Third Section firſt offers
the caſe of the Evil part of Mankind:
That is, of ſuch as have wilfully and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merariouſly
permitted themſelves to be
betray'd into any ſtate of Vice and
Immorality. I ſay, if GOD Almighty
ſhould, in this Life, be preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
every ſuch Evil perſon, as ſoon
as he begins to perſiſt in his unjuſt and
immoral ways; it would prove ſuch a
diſparagement of the Divine Care, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Goodneſs, as could hardly in any
caſe be imagined or repreſented, upon
ſeveral accounts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:42467:58"/>
Firſt, Becauſe he could not then have
allow'd them ſuch ſufficient poſſibilities
of Recovery, as were conſiſtent with the
Mercy of a Gracious GOD to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that were made ſo defectible by
their own original Nature.</p>
                  <p>That is, Who can't conſider, that ſuch
men have generally faln into that irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
ſtate, ſometimes by the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of their own natural Paſſions and
ſenſual Appetities within them, which
they could not unmake, though it were
in their power, with ſome difficulty, to
have over-rul'd them; and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they fell into that ſtate of Sin, by
the Temptations of the World's vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly-enchanting
Objects without them,
which they could not remove, though it
was in their own power, with the ſame
difficulty, to have controul'd and reſiſted
them? I ſay, when theſe occaſions of
their falling into a ſtate of Sin, are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſidered, and then how much thoſe
occaſions do referr to God, as Creator
and Supreme Governour of all things,
What mind can reaſonably entertain a
ſuſpicion, but that an infinitely good
God ſhould allow them the moſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
poſſibilities of Recovery, which an
adjournment of his Adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to a future World can only admit?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:42467:59"/>
And hence appears the reaſonableneſs
as well as the mercy of ſome Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Expreſſions in the Scripture, deſign'd
to repreſent this caſe. There we find,
that the field was not preſently thrown
off to Bryars and Thorns, (it were
againſt Reaſon and common Cuſtom ſo
to do) till the reſpite for Rain and
Dreſſing had given a further Experiment
of its unfruitfulneſs.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 7, 8.</note> Nor was the Fig-Tree
ſentenc'd to be preſently cut down
for the firſt or ſecond, and at laſt, not
for the third years barrenneſs, but it was
ſtill reſpited,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 6.</note> and huſbanded, till the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
term was paſt, that, by a wiſe Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman's
reaſonable obſervation, it
might be judged hopeleſly unfruitful.</p>
                  <p>And as by this reſpiting and adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Divine Juſtice, every impenitent
Sinner is made altogether inexcuſable,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note>
so is God's love and equity univerſally
acquitted, as having moſt reaſonably al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him all advantages for his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which the caſe and nature of the
thing would bear. So that I doubt not,
but that Almighty GOD may as juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay to every unfortunate impenitent
perſon, as he did to his unfruitful Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,<note place="margin">Eſay 5.</note>
                     <hi>What could I have done more, that I
have not done?</hi> That is, not limiting
God's Power in himſelf, but ſuppoſing


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42467:59"/>
him to act according to the meaſures and
nature of men, as reaſonable Creatures.
This is the firſt reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To evidence that it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
that God ſhould ſuſpend his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
univerſal Juſtice to the evil part
of Mankind, to a future World, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he might allow them a fair and
equitable poſſibility of recovery, as to
their own intereſt, but becauſe ſuch a
preſent execution of his Juſtice upon
them, would be highly detrimental to
the common Good of the World in its
ſeveral Societies. That is, if Fire ſhould
come down from Heaven, to conſume
every Oppreſſor, as oft as zealous Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
might poſſibly cry for it; or, that
God ſhould throw away every unjuſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
from his protection, and as oft cut
him down in his vengeance, as the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of every Good man's Cauſe might
be effected by it; What great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
might the World's Societies be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of, by the loſs of ſo many Evil
men, to whom God had allow'd, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
an after-attempt for their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Recovery?</p>
                  <p>If there had not been ſuch ſuſpenſions
of God's Juſtice to ſuch men, then had
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> never been called a <hi>Saint;</hi>
nor had he become ſo uſeful an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42467:60"/>
for the firſt eſtabliſhment of the
Chriſtian Faith: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had died a
Perſecutor of the Church and Doctrine
of Chriſt, of which he afterward became
ſuch a ſucceſſful promoter, and ſo ſtout
a defender: And the Chriſtian Religion
had then been deprived of the Patronage
of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, for the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Sins of his Youth. And as I have
inſtanc'd in theſe few, ſo if we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of thoſe millions of Evil men, who
on that account have been afterward
uſeful to ſuch like purpoſes, we might
eaſily be convinced of the reaſonableneſs
of God's ſuſpenſion of the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Juſtice, upon every man, as
ſoon as he became wicked; and who, at
ſeveral ſeaſons of their mortal Lives, have
ſo ſucceſſfully made after-attempts for
their recovery to Vertue, with ſo much
advantage to the World.</p>
                  <p>3. The third Reaſon to demonſtrate,
that it was God's deſign, that the ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and adjourning of his univerſal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to a future World (beſides for the
equitable poſſibilities of their recovery to
their own benefit, and for their after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſefulneſs
in general) is, becauſe it can
only ſolve a conſiderable doubt in his
ordinary viſible providence as to many
of thoſe Evil men, even while at preſent


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42467:60"/>
they live in a ſtate of Sin. And that is
when we ſee that ſuch men do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
live in a tolerable well-being in the
World, but that they very frequently
enjoy greater inſtances of a flouriſhing
Proſperity,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.</note> and (as <hi>David</hi> complains)
that they ſometimes <hi>come in no misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
like other men.</hi> And then the reaſon
is, that with reſpect to a Future World,
they might have an encouragement, as
well as a reſpite to repent. That is, as
if God deſign'd to tell them, that as he
hath at preſent ſo much favour for them,
as to allow them, by his general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
more than ordinary conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Portions of Advantage in this World;
ſo that they might from thence reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
interpret, that God is not as yet
made unplacable to their Perſons, or
would rejoice at their following unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievable
ſtate of miſery; but that on the
contrary, his mercy and goodneſs are
alwaies moſt ready to admit them to
his preſent Spiritual Bleſſings and future
Happineſs, whenſoever they ſhall prepare
themſelves for their reception. And
that, as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He hath already ſo much Love
for them, as to permit His Sun at preſent
to ſhine upon them, ſometimes with a
greater Benignity than upon others; and
to let his Rain deſcend upon their Fields,


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42467:61"/>
ſometimes with more refreſhing ſhowers
than upon other mens; ſo that his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and pardon ſhall be as readily affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them, whenſoever they ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to qualifie themſelves for the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Bleſſings that relate to a future
Life.</p>
                  <p>But if in contradiction to all theſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations
of God's Favour and Patience,
they ſhall ſtill obſtinately <hi>ſet their hearts
to do evil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe ſentence againſt an evil
work is not ſpeedily in this world executed;</hi>
yet they have all the reaſon imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
(with the vain young man in the
ſame wiſe Book) to conſider, that after
all their ſenſual enjoyments, they <hi>muſt
all come to Judgment.</hi> And though (and
becauſe) they may eſcape the execution
of God's Vengeance in this World, yet
they cannot (if they will allow their
minds a liberty of conſidering like men)
but fear it in another.</p>
                  <p>And as by acknowledging ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
our ſcepticks may thus reaſonably
extricate that doubt in providence, ſo ſuch
as are believers may ſolve another query in
the Chriſtian Religion. That is, why our
Saviour ſhould ſo extraordinarily engage
his Diſciples univerſal Charity to ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
men, even ſometimes when they are
their own moſt deadly enemies. That is,


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42467:61"/>
that he ſhould call ſuch a Charity,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 48.</note> the
neareſt approach to Perfection, and an
especial aſſimulation of the God-head;<note place="margin">Luke 6. 14, 15.</note> or
that he ſhould make no after-remark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other Article of his own Prayer,
but upon that of Forgiving Treſpaſſes;
and ſhould make it the moſt indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
condition of all the pardon they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
can expect from Him. And then
that this Charity, upon ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
ſhould oblige them to all manner of
methods for their recovery, as by reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and adviſing them by forgiving and
praying for them, and by ſupporting their
lives with all manner of neceſſaries, when
they want them. Now the ſolution of
all this is, that as theſe acts are to be
accounted very conſiderable inſtances of
a good man's duty, and that he ſhall be
rewarded for it; ſo we may believe, that
God the rather inſtituted them to be ſo, not
only from his meer preceptive authority,
but that they might be expedients of his
own Divine Love and Care of that part of
Mankind, that needs his Pardon upon
their Repentance and Amendment; I ſay,
what can poſſibly ſolve this query, but the
belief of Gods reſpiting and adjourning the
adminiſtrations of Juſtice to a Future
World, to expreſs his reaſonable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the evil part of mankind in order
to their recovery?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:42467:62"/>
Now, if againſt this whole reaſon it be
objected, that God ſometimes permits not
wicked men to live out half their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
periods, but cuts them down in the
midſt of their time and ſins; and that
of this as the Scriptures have given ſome
extraordinary inſtances, ſo common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
can in every Age and Place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
us daily Examples.</p>
                  <p>My anſwer to this allegation is, firſt,
That very many inſtances of that nature
are of ſuch Perſons, as have been appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
the willful cauſers of the Shortning
their own lives, and of depriving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of that poſſibility of their own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which God, as to all reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
had allow'd them. And then how
is God concern'd in ſuch fatal miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages?</p>
                  <p>But in caſes where God may be ſo far
chargeable as by permitting the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of natural cauſes (of which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they themſelves were not any ways
at all preſumptuouſly and wilfully cauſal)
to put a ſudden period to ſuch mens
lives, it may be preſum'd that upon a
foreſight of what they would afterwards
do, God might permit it in mercy to
their own perſons, that is, from their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
greater evils, whereby their accounts
might be at laſt the more pitiable.


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42467:62"/>
And then in kindneſs to others, that
their ſudden ſurprizes might be exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to other evil men, that ſurvive, to
take them off from too confident a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of enjoying life, thereby to
make a further delay of their repentance
(in which delay they might otherwiſe
proceed, till their neglects of it might
make their conditions irremediable) if
ſome ſuch examples were not ſometimes
ſet before their eyes. And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſome have endeavoured to ſolve the
Eternal puniſhments of the damned in
Hell; That is, that they may there be
executed upon the Evil, like the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
puniſhments of Malefactors in a
State, to be poſſibly exemplary to ſome
new worlds of Probationers, which may
as poſſibly ſucceed. In which reſpect, if
ſuch a ſolution may be allowable (which
I referr to better judgments, and do but
with ſubmiſſion mention it) why may
not all ſuch examples, as I have diſcours'd
them, be accounted alſo as inſtances of
Gods mercy to numerous others, that
ſhall at that preſent time or afterward
exiſt, rather than to think, that God
ſhould be any otherwiſe pleaſed with ſuch
ſudden and ſevere executions of his Juſtice
upon ſuch ſingle Perſons.</p>
                  <p>And thus this Objection being anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42467:63"/>
it doth upon the conſideration of the
former Reaſons appear moſt accountable,
that God ſhould reſpite and adjourn his
univerſal Juſtice and Judgment for the
ſake of the Evil Part of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>But Gods regard to that Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
concludes not His care of the reſt.
Therefore,</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>Section IV.</head>
                  <p>IN this laſt Section I am concern'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
That an adjournment of
ſo great a part of GOD's univerſal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to another World, doth not only
acquit, but highly advance his moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
care of the good and vertuous part
of Mankind. And this I ſhall do upon
ſeveral Accounts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the belief of ſuch a Reſpite
might keep their minds in a conſtant ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
That GOD intended to make
better proviſions for their Recompences,
than can be had in this preſent world:
In which, the beſt advantages that can
poſſibly be attain'd, are hardly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
enough to bear them up above
the ordinary diſcouragements, which
they may daily meet with for nothing
elſe, but becauſe they are good: And


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42467:63"/>
therefore it's there happineſs to know,
that when their duty calls for a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to more afflictive portions of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
an expectation of preſent recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
would be almoſt a contradiction
in the thing, and that becauſe the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Croſs doth in it ſelf import
a deſtitution of what might make them
conveniently happy in this Life: And
then, that ſuch a conſideration might
put them upon a kind of benign neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
to keep themſelves intire and cloſe
to the deſire and expectation of thoſe
adjourn'd Recompences, that can only
be ſuch, as may make them truly Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
inſomuch, that ſhould the vertuous
but too commonly and ordinarily meet
their juſtifications in this Life, and too
generally be crown'd with preſent ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
as oft as they pray'd for it, or
expected it according to the juſtice of
their Cauſes, they might ſuſpect, that
GOD deſigned to give them their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in this world only, and that, in
ſome diſpleaſure, he had turn'd them off,
to be content with ſuch an unfortunate
exchange.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it's highly reaſonable, that
God ſhould reſpite and deferr the rewards
and recompences of Good and Vertuous
Men to a future State; becauſe it very


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42467:64"/>
often falls out, that it's their beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
that they ſhould not be ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as alwaies to ſucceed in their juſteſt
Enterprizes; nor be alwaies gratify'd
with preſent, though deſired Advantages
in their ſecular Undertakings; and that
becauſe ſome tempers are not at all capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of bearing a ſucceſsful intereſt, and
the beſt and ſtrongeſt Piety hath been
ſtagger'd and endanger'd by it. What
a prodigy of miſcarriage, and of a loſt
vertue was <hi>David</hi> once in his great
proſperity, and how did the following
unſucceſsful paſſages of his life, reſtore
him to a vertuous temper, hardly to
be parallell'd? How much leſs than a
man was he in the one, and how much
more than an ordinary Saint in the
other?</p>
                  <p>And this is the reaſon, Why ſome Men
of eminent Piety, being ſenſible of the
danger of too great and too ſucceſsful
an affluence, have voluntarily choſen to
abridge themſelves of their own juſt
enjoyments; and have been cheerfully
thankful, when Providence hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
them ſome croſs overtures in their
affairs, thereby to abate and leſſen in
them too great a complacency in their
preſent fruitions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:42467:64"/>
But upon this ſubject I ſhall enlarge
my ſelf afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The third Reaſon, why God might
pleaſe to order an adjournment of his
recompenſing Mercies to the Vertuous
and Good to another World is, that he
might the more equitably admit them
in his mercy, to the compleater degrees
of them in that ſtate. For, who can't
conſider, that all good men (of which
none are more ſenſible than themſelves)
have their Failings, and ſome unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Miſcarriages, even when they are
endeavouring to purſue their integrity
as well, and as far, as they can? And
that there be many of them, who, tho'
they may now be as good, as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
mortal nature and circumſtances
will at preſent admit, had paſt ſome
conſiderable Portion of their Lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they return'd to Vertue, in an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
neglect of God, and Goodneſs. And
therefore, in both reſpects, GOD in his
Wiſdom and Juſtice might pleaſe to
leave them unjuſtify'd in many caſes
that concern this Life, that being at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
chaſtiz'd, and as it were, puniſhed
for their many follies, before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to Vertue and Goodneſs, and for
their manifold Infirmities after they
had been ſo recovered they might not be


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42467:65"/>
laid to their charge afterward, ſo as to
occaſion any abatements of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in another World.</p>
                  <p>In theſe three Reaſons is contain'd,
what I had to ſay concerning God's care
of the Vertuous Part of Mankind, for the
adjourning the compleat adminiſtrations
of his Divine Juſtice to another world.
And ſo I have finiſhed the deſign of my
Third Chapter; and then all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes

               <p>AND now having ſtood my ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all the Suggeſtions, that could
be offer'd to invalidate the Three Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent
Parts of the Argument: That is,
having in my firſt Chapter demonſtrated,
that the Juſt and Holy God, at one time

the Juſt Cauſes of the Vertuous,

Authorities, and by every mans own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Obſervation, that that Work is not

having ſhewn that all theſe Premiſes are

exception can poſſibly be alledged againſt

SECOND ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>THE Second Argument that
demonſtrates the Existence
of a Future State, is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon Mans being created
with thoſe Rational Powers or Faculties
of his Soul, by which he hath a mind,
eſſentially advanc'd above the State of all
other viſible Animals, and may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
to come up to a near Reſemblance
or Image of his Soveraign Creatour,
<hi>viz.</hi> his Underſtanding and his Will.</p>
               <p>By the one he is made capable, firſt,
diſcurſively to learn and know, and then
judicially to determine, what is moſt fit
to be undertaken and done for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch an End and Good, as may
properly and ſufficiently anſwer, and be


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42467:68"/>
accommodable to the quality and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
temper of his own Rational Mind.
And by the other, <hi>viz.</hi> his Will, he
is naturally capacitated with a power
in its ſelf, firſt, freely to chuſe ſuch
a Good ſo adjudg'd, as his principal
Intereſt and Happineſs; and then alſo
as freely to embrace, and act all the
Means and Methods propos'd for the
aſſured attainment of it.</p>
               <p>Now if it ſhall be made evident
by plain and convincing Reaſons, that
thoſe great faculties of his Soul, were
not given him deſignedly for the ſake
only of his Mortal Duration, nor for
the attainment of any End or Good,
that relate only to, and are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
by the Period of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Life; but that they were given
him moſt ſpecially and purpoſely for the
end and Intereſt of a Future World,
and for his making uſe in this Life,
of all ſuch means, as directly tend to
the attainment of the Happineſs of that


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42467:68"/>
State, then it naturally and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follows, That <hi>GOD</hi> Almighty
hath conſtituted the Exiſtence of ſuch
a World and State.</p>
               <p>Now that this Argument thus gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

               <p>In the first Chapter, I ſhall give
Reaſons to prove, That thoſe Rational
Powers of the Soul, were not given

Life.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond, I ſhall endeavour to
ſolve ſome Objective Exceptions, by
which it's pretended, that thoſe Faculties
may be improv'd for the attainment of
ſeveral ends in this Life, which may
appear to be ſufficient Reaſons, Why
GOD Almighty ſhould give them to
Mankind, though they ſhould never be


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42467:69"/>
concern'd for any thing, that relates
to a future World.</p>
               <p>In the third Chapter, I ſhall poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
demonſtrate, that thoſe Rational
Powers were principally, and upon the
moſt ſpecial purpoſe given to Mankind,
for the ſake and concern of a Future
Life.</p>
               <p>And if what I have thus propos'd
to be made Good in theſe three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſhall be found to be demonſtrably
true, they muſt neceſſarily inferr the
Concluſion for the undoubted Exiſtence
of another World.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>IN which I am concern'd to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
That thoſe rational Faculties
or Powers of the Soul, were not
given to Mankind for the ſake only
of their mortal Durations: Nor for the
attainment of any End or Good, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
only to, or is determinable by the
period of their preſent Lives.</p>
               <p>And this I ſhall evince by the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of theſe three Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe there is no End or Good
attainable in this World, whoſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can afford the rational mind any
real ſatisfaction, reſt, or acquieſcence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe thoſe beſt Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that are moſt likely in common
opinion and eſtimation, to make the life


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42467:70"/>
of man more acceptable to himſelf, are
not in the power of thoſe faculties to
obtain at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the more deſignedly
and intently Men act for thoſe Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as their principal Intereſt and
Concern, the leſs they can eſcape their
being engag'd in ſuch Follies and Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
as are inconſiſtent with their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of being Reaſonable Creatures.</p>
               <p>And theſe will require the attendance
of ſo many Sections to explain them.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Section I.</head>
                  <p>THE Firſt Reaſon that I offer, why
thoſe Faculties, or the Rational Mind
of Man, were not given him of GOD,
for the attainment of any End or Good,
that relate only to his preſent Mortal
Life, is, becauſe the beſt enjoyments of
this world can't allow him any real or
permanent ſatisfaction, or rational acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence:
As it is ſuppoſed they ſhould,
if his Exiſtence were to be wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
at the period of his mortal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
or otherwiſe it muſt be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that God Almighty had given him
a more unhappy Being, than He had
done to any other Creature beſides, in
that reſpect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:42467:70"/>
Now, as to any direct arguing for this
Truth; that is, that the beſt Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this world cannot afford the
Rational Mind any ſuch ſatisfaction
or acquieſcence, if the common Sence of
Mankind can't ſuperſede my Concern in
that point, I muſt then referr my Reader
to the Fifth Argument, that is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engaged to make good that Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And I ſhall only in this Section
proceed ſo far in that Caſe, as to give
the Reaſons, why the Mind of Man can
admit no ſuch Satisfaction from any, the
beſt enjoyments on this ſide a future
World, or from what relates to it in this
Life.</p>
                  <p>Now, the natural Reaſon of all that
deficiency in thoſe Temporary Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to afford the Mind of Man any
ſuch real and permanent ſatisfaction, is
not only from the Troubles, uncertain
Events, and croſs Accidents that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
attend them, (as univerſally men
complain and ſuggeſt as the only reaſons
of their diſcontentment) but principally
becauſe by Divine Ordination all ſuch
Enjoyments do properly and naturally
relate, not to the ſatisfactions of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
and Rational, but of the inferiour
and animal part of man's Being. For,
though the ſuperiour mind doth concern


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42467:71"/>
it ſelf in the managery of thoſe Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for the better conveniencing
mens mortal Lives, yet is that rather
matter of Miniſtration and ſervile Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
than of real and ſatisfactory
fruition.</p>
                  <p>It's true (to make good our Reaſon)
that thoſe enjoyments of this Life may
ſometimes be pleaſing Entertainments for
the Fancy and Imagination, and may
gratifie mens Senſes, corporeal Appetites,
and the other Diſpoſitions and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which humane Nature holds in
common with ſenſitive Beings; but it's
very rare, and impermanent, and almoſt
unnatural, if the Rational Soul ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it ſelf to entertain any kind of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
by the fruition of any of them.</p>
                  <p>And this appears experimentally true,
becauſe the more intently any man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
his conſidering mind to balance the
worth and importance of any ſuch frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
let them relate to Pleaſure, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Honour, Profit, or Dominion, or
to whatſoever elſe it is, that tempts to
a value, and a preſent acceptation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as to any real ſatisfaction, reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from them: And the more he ſtrives
to make his intellectual Self to come in
as Partner with his animal diſpoſitions,
in the perception of them for ſuch an


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42467:71"/>
End, he will alwaies be ſo much the
more ſenſible, how defective they are
for the making up of any ſuch ſufficient
Good, as may accommodate the nature,
or natural temper, of his Rational
Mind.</p>
                  <p>And therefore hence it is, that the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative
Faculty, Senſes and lower Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
do never entertain thoſe preſent
Objects ſo eaſily and acceptably to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as when men do either want, or
reſolvedly, wholly renounce, or but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the uſe of their conſidering and
reaſoning Powers, from making too near
an inſpection into the Ends which they
attain. And this may be verifi'd by ſome
obſervable inſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt on this account it is, that many
great Perſons do deſignedly deliver up
their minds part, that is, the Rational
conduct of their affairs, and managery
of their Fortunes, to the care and reaſon
of ſome prime Officers; that themſelves,
if they be Religiouſly diſpos'd, might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their underſtandings to more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and ſatisfactory purpoſes; or if they
be ſenſually inclin'd, that they might
careſs themſelves in their Pleaſures,
with a greater freedom, for the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſenſual and animal part of their
Beings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:42467:72"/>
And then upon the ſame Reaſon it is,
that men are ſo apt to applaud, and with
ſuch great delight to recount the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
they did enjoy in the childiſh and
youthful part of their time; that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they then enjoy'd all the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and conveniences of Living, by the
benefit of other mens rational Care and
Underſtandings; and that themſelves did
look no further, than the gratification of
their Sences and Brutal Appetites.</p>
                  <p>And this was the cauſe that induced
<hi>Heraclitus</hi> (as <hi>Laertius</hi> reports it of him)
when the <hi>Epheſians</hi> deſir'd him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the Government of their City,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>De</hi> Vit. Phil Lib. 8.</note>
that he betook himſelf to play among
the Children; intimating thereby, that it,
was much eaſier for him to be ſo ingaged,
than to have his mind taken up with
the managery of their Publick Affairs,
from whence it was not like to receive
any real ſatisfaction, or contentment to
its ſelf, though perhaps his imagination
(if he would have permitted that, as an
end of his undertaking) might have been
gratifi'd with the Plenty, Veneration,
and ſplendid Title of a Governour.</p>
                  <p>Now as this unſatifaction of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
and Rational part of Man, may
thus ariſe from the natural propriety,
that all outward Enjoyments bear to the


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42467:72"/>
Animal part of his Nature, ſo is that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction
much more increas'd, (which
I make as an additional Reaſon) by the
greatneſs of that Impropriety, which
thoſe Enjoyments of this preſent Life,
do hold to the Rational Mind; for they
are not only things indifferent to it, but
ſuch as are alien, divers, and unally'd
to its natural temper; and are objects
as foreign and improper to it, as thoſe
would be uſeleſs to one ſenſe, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong to another. And a man may
as well imagine, that his Taſt ſhould
be affected with a Diſh of Colours, or
a Glaſs of ſhining Light; or that his
Ear ſhould be delighted with ſome fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
Perfume, as that the Rational Mind
of Man, as ſuch, ſhould be really ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
with the fulleſt Fruition of any
thing that relates only and properly to
the Animal Part of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And now if any man of an enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
humour, ſhould, upon this kind of
arguing, ask for a Reaſon in Nature,
why the ſame Perſon integrally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
ſhould be ſo vaſtly differently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in himſelf; and how his Nature
ſhould require for his univerſal ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Objects, that bear ſuch evident
improprieties on ſeveral accounts, both
among themſelves, and to his own mind;


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42467:73"/>
My Anſwer would be, Becauſe there
is in every Man, two kinds of Selfs,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Rational and Animal; each of
them requiring different, and ſometimes
almoſt contrary deſigns, buſineſs, and
objects for their ſeveral natural ends and
ſatisfactions. And for this diſtinction,
the Scriptural Revelation doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give us a moſt plain Account, by
the different notions of a ſpiritual and
carnal Mind and State; the one refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to the government of a Man's mind
and life by Religion and Reaſon, and
the other, according to the humour of
his lower and animal Inclinations: But
the Heathen Philoſophers themſelves,
admitted that diſtinction a great way
towards the ſame purpoſe, even by their
Rational Diſcourſes and Apprehenſions.

as great an Enemy to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as I could have well lighted upon;

And all this ſaid to confirm the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
given, Why thoſe Rational Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that is, the Intellectual Mind could
not be given for the ſake, that is, for
the ends and purpoſes of Man's mortal
Life only, becauſe all the preſent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
that are celebrated, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expedients of humane Happineſs, do
principally and properly relate to the
ſatisfaction of that part of his nature,
which bears an agreement with ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Beings.</p>

                  <p>THe ſecond Reaſon deſign'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
That thoſe Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
or Powers of the Soul were not
given to Man for the ſake, ends, and
intendments of his Mortal Duration, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is, becauſe it is evident, That all the
moſt conſiderable conſtitutions of his
preſent Well-being, and that are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
eſtimation moſt likely to become a
ſatisfactory happineſs to himſelf in this
World; are not directly, nor at all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
placed in his power to obtain
them, when he moſt needs them; nor
can he with any aſſurance recal them,
when he hath been depriv'd of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:42467:74"/>
And then were it not a hard thing to
make ſuch a conception of a good God,
that he ſhould Place man in ſuch a world
for his whole Exiſtence, in which there
ſhould be nothing aſſur'd to him as
attainable by the principal Powers
of his Being, which might render
his life acquieſcent and ſatisfactory to
himſelf?</p>
                  <p>I ſay, who knows not, that it is not in
any mans power certainly to enjoy Peace,
Health, Credit, Friends, Succeſs, Plenty, or
any thing elſe that may make his life ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of any real contentment to its ſelf,
when thoſe faculties act their utmoſt for
their attainment?</p>
                  <p>Let men know and ſtudy for them by
their intellectual capacities, as much as
they can, and chuſe them as earneſtly as
their elective faculty can exert it ſelf;
yet the unfortunate men of the world,
(which are always in one reſpect or other,
by far the greateſt part of Mankind)
will tell you, that they might as well
have been obliged to alter the general
fixt courſe of nature in its Stated order,
as to attain all thoſe perquiſites that muſt
ordinarily concurr, to make up ſuch a
kind of living, as by which they may
think themſelves to have eſcaped their
being more miſerable, than any other


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42467:74"/>
viſible Creatures whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And therefore our wiſe Maſter, when
he had adviſed his Diſciples, not to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitouſly
concern'd about the neceſſaries
and conveniencies of their Mortal lives,
gave them this reaſon, <hi>Becauſe they were
no more at their diſpoſe and command,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>than
was the heightning their Stature by another
Cubit.</hi> That is, that they were by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
ordination not certainly in their
power at all. And though it may be
ſaid, that ſome men do ſometimes (and
their number is not great) ſucceſsfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
themſelves in ſome proſperous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
in their Mortal ſtate; yet it may
be preſumed, that thoſe preſent advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
have by far the moſt generally faln
out, where there have happened Caſes
ſo effectually circumſtantiated, as if they
were purpoſely ſet by providence for ſuch
ſucceſſes: and which were interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
little otherwiſe, than as it may be
ſaid, that a mans hand can take up Gold,
when it's laid before him; or embrace his
proſperity, when it's provided for him, as
an effect of ſome propitiouſly concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
cauſes and accidents, which gave
<hi>Solomon</hi> the Reaſon to ſay, <hi>That the Race
was not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the
Strong; neither Bread to men of Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
nor yet Favour to men of Skill, but


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42467:75"/>
Time and Chance happens to all.</hi> That
is, that thoſe happy events did not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
come to paſs according to thoſe
mens excellent qualifications, but that
they proceeded from ſome over-ruling
cauſe of that Time and Chance; of which
expect ſome account at the period of this
Section.</p>
                  <p>And this ſolves the obſervation why
it doth ſo often come to paſs, that the
beſt outward materials of a pretended
happineſs in this world, do become the
Portions of men but indifferently qualify'd
in the regions of their minds, and very
frequently of ſuch, as are hardly ſo much
as are ſenſible of the value of their own
plenteous circumſtances: or elſe of ſuch
as are ſenſually diſpos'd, and then they
either abuſe. Them by their pride
and intemperance, or elſe diſimprove
them through their own indiſcretions and
careleſneſs to their own diſcontent, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the lots of ſuch as have the
largeſt ſhare of intellectual endowments,
or that are the greateſt Friends to Worth
and Vertue.</p>
                  <p>And for that reaſon it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
even to a Proverb, that men of
the fineſt and moſt ingenious parts have
ſeldom acquitted themſelves from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
ſtreights of Fortune, nor from very


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42467:75"/>
undecent dependencies: And that to have
been ſaid, to be as indigent as a Poet or
a Philoſopher, was thought as ſevere an
exprobation of being poor, as could well
be given.</p>
                  <p>It's true (to invalidate my thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning)
that it is commonly affirm'd,
That an exact frugality will make a man
Rich; That a cloſe retirement will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him Quietneſs of Life; and, That
Temperance will ſecure his Health and
long Life: And then (they'll ſay) that all
theſe expedients for thoſe conſiderable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
towards a mans eaſier and happier
Being in this life, are all of them in the
power of the rational faculties to judge,
chuſe, and undertake at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>My anſwer to this Allegation is, That
thoſe expedients do ſo uncertainly and
contingently attain their ends, that all
caſes conſidered, it will hardly allow a
mans thoughts a probability, that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhould ſucceed according to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
Expectations. And to evince this,
I ſhall admit thoſe three caſes to a more
minute examination.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt of them, a ſtrict and
cunning Frugality: Let me demand
of my Objecter, whether he thinks
that the moſt anxious care can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
unfaithfulneſs in all them, upon


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42467:76"/>
whom the induſtrious Frugals muſt be
preſumed more or loſs to rely, on one
occaſion or other, for truſt or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
or can their niceſt obſervation ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them from common Cheats, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
frauds? or can a Box of writings or a
Cheſt defend their Wealth from the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſings
of War, and all other the common
accidents of humane Life? And if ſo,
what kind of certainty can ſuch men
preſume upon to encourage them in this
undertaking, for their own ſufficient
happineſs in this World?</p>
                  <p>Then as to the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in order to a quiet Life: Can it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a man from all the effects of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
the certain attendant of a deſign'd
privacy? Can it prevent the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of being friendleſs, as oft as his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Publick calls for the favour
of men in power, to help him to what
is right or kind? Or can it ſecure him
from being ſeized upon as a prey by thoſe
who mark out the private, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary,
for the execution of their miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
and ſometimes bloody purpoſes?
And then, I ſay, with what a ſtrange
kind of improbability, muſt ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
attain its end to their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>As to the laſt expedient, Temperance,


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42467:76"/>
in order to the ſecuring a mans health
and long life: Is it yet determin'd, upon
any general ground of reaſon or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
what ſhould be the certain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of ſuch a Temperance? Or did ever
any skilful Perſon pretend to give any
ſuch infallible rules of it, as might be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally
accommodable? Or if the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of a temperate life could be ſtated
by a common meaſure, would they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a mans health and long life, from
hereditary evil conſtitutions, or from
common contagions, or from the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſurprizes of Epidemick diſeaſes? Or
laſtly, from ſuch diſtempers, as may
be occaſion'd by diabolicals impreſſions,
which may at any time, through the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
permiſſion, be as commonly acted, as
inſtances have been given of ſuch caſes,
by moſt credible and unſuſpected relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and as they ſtand upon Authentick
records? For which the Learned <hi>Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
may be conſulted; I ſay, all thoſe
Caſes being duly conſidered, who can
preſume to think, that God hath plac'd
any mans health or long life, with any
aſſurance in his own power, by the beſt uſe
he can make of his intellectual Faculties?</p>
                  <p>And now, becauſe I have thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
in favour of my Argument,
to remark this laſt temporal Bleſſing,


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42467:77"/>
and Enjoyment, Health; which in moſt
reſpects ought to be accounted the
principal and neceſſary Attendant and
Concomitant of all preſent humane
Well-being; Let me a little further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
my Obſervation of the defect and
inſufficiency of Man's rational faculties
for the attainment and preſervation of
it. And that not only becauſe a mans
own Underſtanding may be ſo eaſily
defeated in finding out the expedients
of its ſafety, but becauſe the Reaſon

the Margin, and without interpretation,
to avoid offence; for I have ſaid all this


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42467:77"/>
upon no other deſign, but to improve
the notion I have here undertaken upon
my Reaſoning for the certain Exiſtence
of a Future State.</p>
                  <p>And now having thus concluded my
ſecond Reaſon, let me ſuperadd one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
upon that account; that is,
Suppoſe it ſhould be inquir'd, that ſince
Man hath naturally ſo little power over
the circumſtances of his own Well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this World, by what other cauſe
or cauſes are Mens preſent conditions
conducted, or whether by none at all?</p>
                  <p>My anſwer is, that the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Future World; and GOD's
deſign, that Mens principal Happineſs
ſhould be placed and expected in that
State, doth moſt plainly and naturally
anſwer that Enquiry; and that, without
flying to ſtubborn Fate, or blind For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
(as ſome, even great Philoſophers
have done) it doth perfectly ſolve the
doubt. That is, that GOD was pleas'd
to take upon himſelf the care of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
every Mans portion of outward
things in this Life; and in that manner
as he ſaw might beſt ſuit with every
mans particular temper, and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for the better attainment of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
in the other World. And then
moreover, that men, upon a proſpect


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42467:78"/>
of the uncertainty of their own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for any aſſur'd ſucceſſes in this life
according to their own deſires, might
have, as a greater reaſon, ſo more leiſure
and opportunity, to attend the concerns
of another to come: That is, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
reaſons, that they might not be
folicitous about what they ſhould Eat, or
Drink, or put On, but ſhould leave all thoſe
events to the wiſe conduct and care of a
Gracious God, and then entertain them
with the ſame indifferency and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
that ſenſitive Beings do, who
ſubſiſt by the ordination of the ſame All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſing
Hand of God. Always conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that as thoſe Animals comply with
the Divine Providence, by a natural care
of themſelves, and in actions to which
their nature obligeth them for their own
preſervation; ſo ſhould men make uſe
of their Rational powers for the careful
improvement of all ſuch means, which
God allows them (as he thinks fit) for the
better management of their own Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beings
in this world; but ſtill with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to their principal buſineſs and
deſign, of attaining the happineſs of a
following life. This the Second Reaſon.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>third</hi> Reaſon intended with fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
explanation to repreſent, that
mans Rational Faculties, and Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Mind, were not likely to be given him,
for the ſake of his mortal life only, is
becauſe it's commonly obſerv'd, that the
more deſignedly, and intently, men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their minds and lives, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of ſuch ends and ſatisfactions,
as relate only to their preſent enjoyments;
the leſs are they likely to eſcape their
acting ſuch follies and abſurdities, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conſiſt with their characters of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reaſonable Creatures. And that the
highest wiſdom ſuch men do commonly
arrive at, will in their beſt ſucceſſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to little more than what the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
diſcretion Brute animals themſelves
expreſs, in the mannagement of their
well-beings.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it were well for the
happineſs of moſt of that ſort of men,
who appear to live to no other purpoſe,
but to ſerve the intereſts of their mortal
durations only, that a few of thouſands of
them, could in the managment of their
ſecular and ſenſual deſigns, arrive at the


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42467:79"/>
common and natural prudence of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Brutes. So that when it is uſually
ſaid, that if men live only for their
own ends and ſenſual ſatisfactions in this
world, that they degenerate into Beaſts,
they put a diſparagement upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of thoſe Creatures (whom <hi>Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
contends to make,<note place="margin">De Abſt. lib. 3.</note> as it were, co-bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
with us in the Rational world) and
that becauſe they regularly act their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
powers and faculties for their own
good, agreeably to the ends for which
they were made; whereas when men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the concerns of another world,
they act commonly in contradiction to
their own principal natures, and do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
not ſo much into Brutes, as that
they turn Fools and Sots.</p>
                  <p>And though it's a common cuſtom
to call men wiſe, who live at that rate,
with any preſent ſucceſs in their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſigns; yet it muſt be preſum'd, that
it is at beſt by way of compariſon, that is,
that they may be leſſer Fools than others;
or perhaps this may be done by a kind
of mutual combination among ſuch men
themſelves, to call one another Wiſe, where
there is no manner of manly reaſon, why
they ſhould be ſo accounted; and perhaps
all the reaſons in the world, why they
ſhould be reputed otherwiſe, if their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42467:79"/>
and ends, actings and diſcourſes,
were meaſured by the Standard of that,
which is true and genuine Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>And further, to enforce the Reaſon
why on this account it may more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
appear, that Almighty God did
not furniſh Mankind with thoſe Rational
Powers on purpoſe for the ſake only of
their mortal Durations, (which muſt be
ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if no World in future) is becauſe it's
obviouſly obſerv'd, that the greater Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of intellectual abilities, whether
complexionall or acquir'd, that thoſe men
have, who live only to their own preſent
ſenſual ends; and the more ſolicitouſly
they apply their minds for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them, without any regard at all
of what's to come in a future World, ſo
much the more remarkable are their
degeneracies to folly and abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we may take notice,
that ſuch kinds of men, if they be but
indifferently qualify'd in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
and of duller Capacities, do
alwaies act all their ſenſual Adventures,
as with weaker deſires, ſo with fewer
imprudencies, and do even ſeem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
wiſe and diſcreet in their very
follies. And I ſhall inſtance in ſome
caſes, their Covetouſneſs (when it falls
out to be the preſent humour) is leſs


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42467:80"/>
ſolicitous; Their Amours more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
They drink more quietly, talk
more temperately, and their Paſſions are
more tolerable: And indeed, as in theſe,
ſo in all other kinds of ſenſual and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
regards, they act like prudent men
in compariſon of thoſe Perſons, that are
of more lively and brisk Capacities. For
their covetous humour is manag'd with
more cunning and over-reaching In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues;
Their Amours are violent and
diſturbing: Their Drink makes them as
riotous as Bethlems; Their Paſſions rage
and are intolerable; Their Talk is cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous
and provoking: And indeed in
all their Senſualities, their Wit engageth
them to act their ſeveral humours and
inclinations, to their own greater folly
and miſfortune. So that in the event,
many of them may be eaſily tempted
to wiſh that they had been born natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Fools, Brutes, Trees, or any thing, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to have been made Intellectual
Beings, ſo much to their own diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
                  <p>Now, how could ſuch Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
be poſſibly engag'd in ſuch reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
miſcarriages of their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but that their Minds had loſt their
proper and natural Authority over their
own Affections and Appetites, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42467:80"/>
over their own Thoughts and
Actions, for want of being principally
concern'd for Religion and Vertue, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the happy events of a future
World? For their Rational Powers
being left to have nothing to be imploy'd
about, but for the ends, and pretended
ſatisfactions of this Life, it's no wonder
that they ſhould admit, if not admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
to, ſuch wild exceſſes of Folly and
Indiſcretions.</p>
                  <p>So that if any unconcern'd Perſon of
an obſerving humour, would but take
the pains (if it were but for his diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
to make an impartial Survey of
the Rational World, as at any time men
generally do appear to act their ſeveral
parts in it, and then would but recount,
as far as he can make a Proſpect, the
various Follies and Imprudencies which
the men wholly unconcern'd for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and another World, do daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and habitually perſiſt in, he could
not but judge, that too great a part of
it would look like one entire Scene of
Fools and Mad-men. That is, ſhould he
but particularly take notice how ſillily
one man manageth his love of Money,
another his fondneſs to a Woman:
With what idle extravagancies a Third
is treating the pride of his Heart; while


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42467:81"/>
another is tugging hard for a Feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap
promotion: And ſhall then obſerve,
how ſuch a man's next Neighbour is, by
his reſtleſs humour, ſtorming every body
out of their peace and order; while he
ſpies another ſort of cunning Men ſit
cloſe together in a corner, drinking
away their Health, Fortune, and Reaſon;
with a thouſand ſuch-like idle Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to which their unconcernedneſs
for Religion and another World, do daily
expoſe them.</p>
                  <p>And now, if any man ſhould adviſe
me, the more convincingly to make
Good what I have thus ſo ſeverely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
concerning ſo great a part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
who will be apt to rage to ſee
themſelves thus ridiculouſly expoſed, I
could think of no other expedient, that
would more effectually acquit me, than
to make uſe of a little Burleſque, which
an honeſt Country Droll hath promiſed
me, to dreſs up ſome of thoſe intellectual
Fops in their proper Garbs. For ſome
great Authors have told me, That the
beſt way of handling an artificial Fool, is
to do it in his own kind: And to laugh
him into Diſcretion would be the beſt
expedient to recover him from his
Folly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:42467:81"/>
But then the Author's deſire is, That
it may ſtand in the midſt of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
but in the nature of a Parentheſis;
ſome telling him that it's too light for
the gravity of the Argument; and others
again, of another opinion, perſwaded
him by all means to let the Fools ſee
how the repreſentations of their Folly
doth become them, when they have
read their own ridiculous Characters.
And <hi>let it go</hi> at all adventures.</p>
                  <p>(The firſt ridiculous piece among the ſilly
Crew, of whom my Neighbour brought me
a deſcription, was of one, whoſe debauch'd
Imagination, for want of being concern'd
for his beſt Intereſt, had betray'd his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to think, that it would be principally
for his happineſs, if he could but grow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
Rich; and that with an eſpecial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
to raiſe up a ſucceeding Family, big
enough, to make a great Show in the World.
And as the moſt likely Expedient for the
carrying on his wiſe Project, he imploys all
his intellectuals, how he may beſt attain to
the mighty Art of Thrift. And then to that
as to his Deity, he devotes all the powers
of his Soul; and ſacrificeth to it, not only
all that may be uſeful to others, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
or decent for himſelf. And for
that end, (to inſtance in ſome caſes) if
neceſſity doth but at any time hector him


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42467:82"/>
into a mind to cloath his Carcaſs, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
(for that can only ſolve his diſcontent
about the Charges of it) is to wardrup up
the old Caſe, as part of his Stock, to be
Inventoried by his Executor when he dies.</p>
                  <p>If he eats, the only Hautgouſt that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth
his Meat, is either that it coſts him
nothing, or as it beſt agrees with his ſtomach
in his Pocket; for there principally laies
his hunger and thirſt, and the palatings he
delights in.</p>
                  <p>If he rides abroad, it's generally upon an
Animal, whoſe bones he deſigns to tell in
for money, in the next Summ he takes Bond
for. And if at any time he ſeems kind or
civil, it's only to them, of whom he deſigns
to make a Prize upon a fore-ſeen Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>The Furniture of his Houſe is nothing
but a rubbag'd heap of Pawns and Streſſes:
and his Store-houſe is generally ſtock'd with
nothing elſe but the atoning Preſents of
his afrighted Creditors. But if a Vote for
a Tax be rumour'd, though the King's, or
the Church's Safety lays at ſtake for want
of Money, it ſounds in his Ears like a Knell,
or a Raven. His Religion is a Conventicle
to chuſe, for there he can ſit or lie along,
pull his Hat over his Eyes and Count, and
not be interrupted with ſometimes ſtanding
up, and then kneeling down, and ever and


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42467:82"/>
anon, with ſaying, an <hi>Amen,</hi> or a <hi>Lord
have mercy upon me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or with the like
Invaſions upon his Chriſtian Liberty. But
if the Preacher in that place muſt have
Money, then farewel to that Religion;
ſaith he, I can diſcharge my Chriſtianity
at a cheaper rate at home: that is, by
reading ſome Chapters every Sabbath night:
let them be out of <hi>Geneſis</hi> or <hi>Matthew,
Canticles</hi> or <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that's all one
to me; ſo they be read.</p>
                  <p>But to be ſure, he hates all thoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
that put men to Charge for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Vtenſils, Repairs of Edifices, and
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aarons:</hi> Nothing ſo abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to him: And then a Sacrament with
an Offering, and a Prieſt in a Dreſs, and
who muſt have Tithes too; and if ſo, that
are uncrampt by a Two penny-cuſtom: All this,
<hi>ſaith he,</hi> is downright Idolatry and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian.
And as for thoſe days they call Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidays,
they are meer loſs of time, and turn to
no common Profit: And they are <hi>Popery</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>Now all this while, when there is any
thing to be got by it, he is as poor as he
can creep, and looks alwaies of ſuch a kind
of Quality, that did not ſome men now and
then miſtake him for a Conjurer, one would
ſwear, that he were downright ſome Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Officer
in the Common-Wealth of Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars.
And indeed to ſave Charges, he


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42467:83"/>
could find in his heart to take a turu or
two with them about the <hi>Country:</hi> but to
be ſure, it ſhall be no longer, than till they
come to their General Rendezvous: He
knows how to make better uſe of his Money,
than to bear a <hi>Club</hi> among thoſe merry
and generous companions.</p>
                  <p>But ſtay! While this Man of Gold is
going on thus haſtily in his wiſe Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for getting Money, ſuddenly a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
arreſts him for an old Debt, ready
to burn down his Souls dry Tenement;
or a Dropſie opens a Flood to drown it.
And then he ſighs, and is troubled in
Conſcience, that he hath yet but enough
to make ſome Body, but an ordinary
Knight or Squire. And if he dies upon't,
the laſt event of all his wiſe Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
is;<note place="margin">Octo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Caeſar habet.</note> that when the joy-ſorrow of
his Heir hath once Serjeanted up a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
to an eight-foot Dungeon, with a
Pompous Funeral; it's odds but the
World will ſmile, that he hath gotten all
that Treaſure for one, that's like to
know little more, than how to talk idly
and ſwear; go gay and drink; and to turn
the New Houſe in the Country, deſign'd
for the Seat of the Chymerical Family firſt
into an Inn, or a Seraglio, and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
into a ſheet of Parchment, for the uſe
of another Fop, that may act the Part of
Father or Son.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:42467:83"/>
Aſſoon as my merry Neighbour had
dreſt up for me the former hopeful
Adventurer, for a preſent Happineſs, in
his Fools Coat, he preſently changeth
the Scene, and dreſſeth up another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Brute, of a quite contrary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and he is as wiſe as Drink can
make him. And the firſt Enterprize
that his contriving Underſtanding puts
him upon, whereby to get rid of the
incumbrances of his Wit and Money, is to
lead about a Hog (I mean himſelf) in a
ſtring from Town to Town, to make
Sport for a Regiment of Boys and Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
with his frantick adventures.</p>
                  <p>But in a while, being tir'd with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſo much work for Conſtables,
Juſtices, and Glaſiers, he reſolves, upon
important Reaſons, to take a wiſer me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
for his own greater happineſs; and
that is to ſet up for himſelf, and to be
his own Inn-keeper at home. And for
that end he furniſheth his Houſe with
all manner of Utenſils for the ſooping
Imployment; he turns all his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
into drinking Rooms: Only he
ſolemnly devotes his Cellar for a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
where he and his devout drunken
Aſſembly do conſtantly finiſh their laſt

knees, if the Health be to Some-body;
and in the morning they return thither
again, and are as zealous as Thirſt can
make them, to pay their early Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
at the Tap. And in this more ſolemn
place, as in a Repertory, he ſets up all
his drinking Laws and Sanctions; and at
the heads of the Veſſels ſtands up chalk'd,
the only Almanack, by which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
how the Year paſſeth, alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
from the famous Months of
<hi>March</hi> and <hi>September.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And by this time you may imagine,
that the Head-houſe is become one intire
Inn, or indeed one naſty Trough, common
to all the Swine in the Country: Where all
the Year long they are ſwallowing down
the Sun, and drinking up the Night, till
the Morning diſcovers how all the Rooms
are ſpread over with ſo many ſprawling
Monſters, where one hath loſt his Legs,
another his Eyes, and All, their Wits;
ſo that, if a Stranger ſhould come in, and
would have but patience to ſtop his
Noſe, he cannot but think, that he had
in proſpect ſome new-faſhion'd Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
or that he had in view thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
ſhapes which the <hi>Egyptian</hi> drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Mud produceth, when it hath a

                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:42467:85"/>
And now having a few Years conſtantly
attended to this wiſe way of living, (as if
he had been ſhut up to be fatted in a Sty)
at length his body ſwells to the likeneſs,
and perhaps, to the bigneſs of one of his
large Caſks, which in a ſhort time begins
to leak at ſo many Orifices, deſign'd by
Art and Nature, to prevent the inundation
of a Dropſy, that at laſt his Aſſociates are
neceſſitated, for fear of a common Contagion,
to remove that unweildly Puddle of humours,
and lodge it in a little dark Cellar under
ground, where a briſk Club of little Good-Fellows
of his own breeding, ſtave him, or
(as they call it) duſt him, and merrily
drink him up to a drop, before they have
done.)</p>
                  <p>Thus ends the long (and to ſome
perhaps unwelcome) Parentheſis; but
they may paſs it over if they pleaſe;
and there is no hurt done.</p>
                  <p>Now, to theſe two, I could have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
many more ſuch like Characters of
other ſorts of Fops, who are as conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acting their ſilly Parts upon the
World's Stage, but my deſign'd method
would not admit ſuch an Inlargement
in a ſingle Paragraph; And, perhaps,
theſe two are too many already in ſome
mens opinions. But if I had not thought,
that I might do ſome conſiderable Good

by ſuch an attempt, I had certainly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to have laid them aſide. That is,
That when ſuch men ſhould ſee, as it
were in a Glaſs, their own ridiculous
deformities, they might bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of putting on a wiſer and more
acceptable Garb of Living; and then
that others, who were not yet ingaged
in thoſe Follies, might endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their appearing in the World, ſuch
Monſters of Abſurdity.</p>
                  <p>And this was done, not that I thought
that all men who are not concern'd for
Religion and another World, do always
make uſe of their Rational powers to ſo
very ridiculous purpoſes, as ſuch a piece
of ſportful Characters do repreſent them;
yet I am aſſur'd, that there be always too
many in the world, that do really come
up even to the higheſt degrees of ſuch
kinds of follies, and even among them that
have no cauſe to complain of any defect,
either in their Natural, or acquir'd Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
abilities.</p>
                  <p>And then as for thoſe that do not come
up to ſuch famous and clamorous pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of abſurdity, in the management of
their Senſual ingagements of life, I am
ſo far ſatisfied, that there is no man, that
reſolv'dly quits his mind of all concerns
for a Future World, but when he acts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42467:86"/>
for preſent ends and ſatisfactions, as
the ſole happineſs, which he reſolves to
expect, but that his practices and their
events, muſt more or leſs bear a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to ſuch deſcrib'd follies. And
though perhaps ſome mens actions may
admit mixtures of ſome diſcretion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
of ſome other ſenſualiſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
yet generally ſuch men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but move and act beneath the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of a Rational Being; and their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will be found to be as great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention
from their natural humanity,
as if a Prince, who exempting himſelf
from his Governing Affairs, ſhall ſpend
his time in catching Flies, and tending
an Aviary, or practiſing the Trade of an
Artificer, with ſuch like impertinent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.
And though ſome other ways
of paſſing away the time, that are in
faſhion, may have gain'd a better repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in common opinion, (ſetting aſide
what uſe may be made of them, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
divertiſements) may yet in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
be as ſilly and childiſh as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
when right Reaſon, the great judge
of human actions, ſhall arraign their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portancies,
and how far they come ſhort of
that Wiſdom, to which the Grandeur of
a rational Being ſhould aſpire. This
the laſt of the <hi>three</hi> Reaſons.</p>

                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:42467:87"/>
And thus I have argu'd, how thoſe Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tational
Faculties and mans Intellectual
Mind, could not be given him for the ſake,
ends, and intendments only of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
life. I ſhould now attend to what
may be ſaid to prove, that they were
principally, and on the moſt ſpecial pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
given him, for the ſake and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of another World. But my excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
have deſign'd other work for me,
and I muſt firſt attend to them, and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquit my ſelf of their ſuggeſtions to
the contrary of what I have endeavour'd
to prove, before I can be ingaged in that
main buſineſs which concerns the chief

very conſiderable expedient of human

               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Section I.</head>
                  <p>IN this Section we muſt wait upon
the learned Nation, who will be
apt to ſuggeſt and ſay, That though
thoſe Noble Faculties, when they are
wholly imploy'd about the unſufficient
Ends and Happineſs, which worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
pleaſure, and a ſenſual way of
living, can be pretended to afford, may
be found ſo defective (as hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented)
yet as they may be improv'd
for the attainment of univerſal Learning,
which hath been always accounted ſuch
a ſpecial accompliſhment and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

End, why Man might be furniſhed with


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42467:88"/>
thoſe rational qualifications, though they
were never to be concern'd at all, for
what relates to a Future World.</p>
                  <p>My Anſwer to this ſeemingly great
Exception is, that I ſhall evince that that
which is reputed Learning in all its
parts, can no more accommodate the
natural temper of Man's rational mind,
as to any real ſatisfaction, than the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of any other temporal Good;
and that it is ſubject to the ſame defai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancies
for ſuch an end, even in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
acquiſitions, that humane life can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
admit.</p>
                  <p>And all this I ſhall endeavour to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
upon the account, of two Reaſons.
Firſt, from the way and manner of its
attainment; Secondly, from the value
and Importance of it, when it's ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
But in the management of which
Reaſons, I muſt crave an ingenuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
from the Lovers and Students
of that univerſal Learning for what end
I do it; that is, thereby intending only
to controul the Theiſts Pretenſions, who
are apt to take all occaſions to invalidate
the neceſſary belief of another World's
Exiſtence: and not at all deſigning to
diſparage the Honour, or diſcourage the
Diligence of them, that attend to the
attainment of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:42467:88"/>
The firſt Reaſon, why ſuch attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Learning could not be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
end in its ſelf for GOD's giving
thoſe rational Faculties to Mankind,
whereby any man might allow himſelf
the thoughts of enjoying ſuch a ſufficient
Good, as might anſwer the temper, and
ſatisfy the deſires of his intellectual mind,
without a principal regard had to his
Concern in a Future World, is from the
manner of his attainment of all Rational
Learning.</p>
                  <p>For then we ſay, how can the mind
of man entertain any ſuch real ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to its ſelf, when it's conſider'd,
That ſo great a part of his Mortal Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
muſt be ſpent and worn up in the
very preparative and proemial Labours
towards the acquiſition of any one part
of that which is reputed Learning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can be preſum'd to be ſo much
a Maſter of it, as to have the pleaſure or
ſatisfaction of comprehending, what is
Intellectual or Rational in it. For he
muſt firſt be ſuppoſed to endure the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
hardſhip of a kind of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and muſt be ſeveral years ty'd
to the drudgery of (as it were) drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
about a Mill, only for the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the little skill, how to read and ſpeak
congruouſly and ſenſibly. He muſt then


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42467:89"/>
incumber his head with a company of
hard terms, definitions, and diſtinctions
in an inſtrumental Art, which are like
to give his mind as much ſatisfaction,
as toil can adminiſter, before he can
be able to work out the diſtinct notions
of things, or be capable to think, or
diſcourſe intelligibly of them.</p>
                  <p>And when after this he comes to a
nearer approach towards any Art or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
he muſt then ſpend ſome time in
charging his memory with the proper
Elements, and ſome introductive gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Principles, (as <hi>Prolegomena)</hi> before
he can ingage in the true underſtanding
of it. Now what contentment or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
can all thoſe previous Labours
be to a Rational Mind, any more, than
the tuning a ſet of Viols to a muſical
Ear, or the confus'd noiſe of Axes and
Hammers, and the unmethodiz'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of a heap of Tools, and unfiniſh'd
Materials, be to him that hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
a Deſign for a ſtately Edifice?
But then after our Students laborious
Preface to his obtaining an entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the wide field of Learning; What
true ſatisfaction can he poſſibly give his
mind, when he cannot but have heard,
that his whole Life (too little for the
perfect attainment of any one conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42467:89"/>
Science) muſt be always in a
progreſſive motion towards the end,
which he propoſeth to himſelf; and for
that Reaſon, he cannot but expect to
live in a ſtate of a continu'd Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to be all his daies in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of a Diſciple.</p>
                  <p>The Senſe of which, though it may
ſometimes be made uſe of, to drive fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on in his Studies; yet a little time
and experience will inform him, that it
is no more, than a going forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſomething, from which he ſhall
always find himſelf as far off, (if not
much farther) as when he firſt ſet forth.
And the reaſon is, becauſe the more he
knows, the more he ſhall ſtill, to his
great diſſatisfaction, find cauſe to think,
that there is yet much more to be learn'd
and known. Every degree of his acquir'd
knowledge, will be but a further diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his ignorance of other things,
and advance his thirſt of what elſe is
yet to be underſtood.</p>

a capacity ordinarily to attain.</p>
                  <p>And now, when the expectant Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
hath once conſidered, how he hath
ſped in the former part of his ſhort
Exiſtence, he may then ſuggeſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
what ſatisfaction he may hope for,
after he hath paſt the Meridian of his
days: That is, whether, as he grows
older, he doth not rather go backward
than forward in the field of Learning;
and upon a nearer approach towards the
period of his life, whether he finds not
apparently that he is upon the retrogreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and loſing point. I don't ſpeak of
that declenſion of age, when it's poſſible
for a man to forget his own Name; but I
mean, whether all along (when he
ſhould be preſum'd to reap ſome Harveſt
of his propos'd ſatisfaction to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of his own mind) he perceives not
a continued diminution in his ſtock of
Learning; which perhaps he imputes to
the ſtreightneſs of his minds Repertory,
that either the later notions do (as it
were) run over into forgetfulneſs, or
elſe being crowded together in ſo ſmall
a room, that they ſtifle and confound
one another. So that, what by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42467:90"/>
of his approaching age, and
the frequent interruptions by infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
What by attendancies to thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
which the neceſſaries and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
of Living do exact from him;
and what by adhering to thoſe Studies,
to which in his Youth he had accuſtom'd
his mind, perhaps he may live to ſee
himſelf baffleable by every freſh Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer,
ſo as to bear the ſhame of being
out-done in common Talk by any ſuch
an one, as is better acquainted with the
newer methods, and later notions of his
own Sciences. And this accounts for
the firſt Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The Second Reaſon, which I intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before to repreſent, That the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Learning (to ſuch a degree as
the Mind can admit in Man's ſhort du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
could not be a ſufficient end,
why GOD Almighty ſhould give thoſe
Rational Faculties to Mankind, for any
real ſatisfaction of humane Life, is from
an examination of what importance and
value ſuch an acquir'd Learning may be
in its ſelf, ſo as to anſwer the Mind's
natural temper, and its innate deſires of
knowledge; And I think I may, in that
reſpect, without offence, affirm, of all the
Learning in the World, That were it not
that it may be made ſerviceable to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42467:91"/>
and practical Goodneſs, in order
to the Intereſt of another World, it
would hardly deſerve its own Name,
eſpecially with ſuch a Character, as the
World allows it. And by reaſon of the
defective attainment of every part of it;
no man did ever think himſelf, in all
points, ſo ſufficiently learned, as to allow
his mind any manner of complacency,
or real ſatisfaction, but the ignorantly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold,
and ſuch an one, whom flattery
and vulgar applauſe had ſeduc'd into
ſuch a blind opinion of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it hath been alwaies
reckoned among the wiſe and modeſt,
to be a conſiderable advance of a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Underſtanding, for a man to think
himſelf to know too little, or even no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,<note place="margin">Dieg.</note>
(as it is reported of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that
he ſhould ſo affirm of himſelf) that is,<note place="margin">Laer.</note>
That he knows nothing comparative of
that,<note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> which he cannot but be ſenſible
is more and more yet to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>What Science is it, that was ever yet
believed by the judicious to be brought
to any tolerable perfection? That which
hath been moſt likely of late to gain the
beſt improvement towards it, is Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Philoſophy, eſpecially as to thoſe
attempts that have been made, for the
finding out the natures of Beings. And


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42467:91"/>
though they have offer'd at thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
with conſiderable ſucceſs, and
perhaps to a greater degree than have
yet been attempted and attain'd, yet
nevertheleſs, I am apt to believe, that
they have ſo far faln ſhort of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
attainment, that if Six Thouſand
men were appointed to find out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of every ſingle Vegetable (as they
account their number) and ſo many
Thouſands more, about the numerous
ſpecies or kinds of Animals, Inſects, and
Minerals, they might be preſum'd to find
ſo far work enough for their whole
Lives, as that <hi>Baſilius Valentinus,</hi> who
writ of Antimony, did affirm, (as
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> relates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">—Nat. Hiſt. p. 13</note> it) that <hi>The ſhortneſs
of Man's Life makes it impoſſible for one
man to underſtand throughly, or to learn
that Mineral only; in which, every day
there was ſomething behind, that was to be
diſcovered afterward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what I may affirm of the great
diſtance of that kind of Learning from
Perfection, the ſame alſo may be ſaid of
all the parts of Learning whatſoever.
That is, (to inſtance in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars)
if he that deſigns a Happineſs to
his mind, by furniſhing it with the beſt
Treaſures, which the Hiſtorian Learning
can afford, could be ſenſible and ſecure,


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42467:92"/>
that there were ſuch a Body of Hiſtory,
in which there ſhould be nothing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that were neither Partial nor Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick:
Or, if he that aims at a great
felicity, by the attainment of the beſt
knowledge in the learned Languages,
were ſure, that if he were Maſter of any
one of them, as far as Art and Study
could advance him, that he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have Thoughts of any defect in the
acquiſition or uſe of it: I ſay, if it might
be ſo affirm'd of theſe, and all other parts
of humane Learning, there might be
ſome pretence for the mind's attainment
of ſome ſufficient ſatisfaction in this life,
without reſpect to another; but when
it's known to be far otherwiſe, it leſſens
the wonder of <hi>Sextus Empericus</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,<note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note>
when he went about to prove ſo
induſtriouſly, that there is no Learning
at all, but in uncertain opinion; and that
in another place ſpeaking

                     </note> but even the impoſſibility of
attaining to the leaſt Reaſon of any one
Science perfectly in the whole Life of

into ſo great an unſatisfaction of mind for
what he had done, as to be weary of his life,
and to make an attempt to caſt it away.</p>
                  <p>And this diſchargeth me of my Second
Reaſon, given to evince, That the value
of Learning is not ſuch, as that either
the mind of Man ſhould have a ſufficient
ſatisfaction in its ſelf, by the attainment
of it, or that it were reaſon enough why
GOD ſhould give Mankind thoſe ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

                  <p>But ſecondly, I anſwer, that if our
Exceptioners mean only, that thoſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Faculties do ſometimes furniſh
Men with a greater natural ſagacity;
and which being improv'd by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and obſervation, may better qualify
them, to contrive and act, what is moſt
convenient for the Pece and well-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
of Nations, it muſt be allowed
as true. But then I ſay, that if thoſe
qualifications be not accompanied with
a concern for a Future World, and with
ſome ſenſe of the neceſſity of being Good
and Vertuous, as an univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
condition of obtaining the Bleſſing
of it; and that thereby ſuch men may
have ſome kind of Conſcience of what's
Right and Good, to oblige them ſo to
act and govern; there would be no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
in the World, with which it were


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42467:94"/>
worth the holding any Communion. All
ſuch natural and acquir'd Capacitations
for publick Good in ſuch men, would
preſently (as it's too generally obſerv'd)
be made uſe of for the more ſucceſsful
proſecution of private Intereſts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.
Princes could no longer enjoy
their Thrones in peace, nor the People
their Social Rights in ſafety, than that
there wanted men, that had ambition,
covetouſneſs, and power enough, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
and invade them both: Nor
would the Communion it ſelf in the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
ſubſiſt, but by a ſtate of War, with
all its attendant calamities and ſavage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and the miſerable conſequences of
the longeſt and moſt ſucceſsful Sword.
Which would highly defame the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's
Wiſdom and Goodneſs, that His moſt
excellent creatures, beneath the Heavens,
ſhould have no better means allowed
them to preſerve themſelves in their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Communions, but by being alwaies
in apparent danger to be haraſſed with
the bloody attempts of cunning and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
men, who would be perpetually
contending for Soveraignty and Power.
To prevent which confuſions, when Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have to deal with a mutinous and
ſeditious People, they are ſometimes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated

And then he
concludes, That Princes
ought (if they intend to
be obeyed, and to have their Kingdoms
quiet) to hold their Subjects, as much as
poſſible, inclin'd and devoted to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>And it ſhould be hence ſuggeſted, that
it is a diſparagement to Religion, when
it's alledg'd to be ſo far concern'd in
politick deſigns; and that it gives too juſt
an occaſion to lewd and atheiſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
to reproach and decry it, as only a
contrivance of ingenious men to keep the
world in order. My anſwer would be, that
if it were true, it would give ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the Divine Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as nothing but a ſpite to the belief of a
Deity, could poſſibly ſuggeſt it. For it muſt
ſuppoſe, that either God could or would
not (when all Beings were in his hand to


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42467:96"/>
diſpoſe of as he thought fit) otherwiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the worlds ſocial ſubſiſtence
and welfare, but by giving men a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and a neceſſity to invent a lye to do
it, and to put a cheat upon mankind, to
attain that End.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe that ſome men, who were
no ways at all affected with the ſenſe (and
perhaps the belief) of Religion, ſhould
be the Authors of that advice to Princes,
to keep the People in more peaceable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
would it thence follow, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
it ſelf had no real foundation in it
ſelf, for that and greater Ends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is it not
known, that ſome particular Perſons, and
even whole parties of men, have artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
contrived a Religious guiſe in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy,
thereby the better to purſue
their private, or their popular deſigns and
ends? and can any Argument be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
thence deduced, to bring the
Truth of the Religion they abuſe into
queſtion? But that rather the contrary
muſt be true, for a deguiſe muſt be of
ſomething that is ſomewhere in real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or there would be no kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for acceptance upon diſſimulation.
If there were no ſuch thing as a Real

                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:42467:96"/>
Now the Summ of this Section is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
That no acts of the Intellectual
Powers can make competent expedients
to preſerve the World in any tolerable
order, unleſs as founded upon the belief
of another world, as it's only practical en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment
(of which expect an account
in my Third Argument, <hi>Chap. 3. Sect. 1.)</hi>
whereby the Reaſons or Conſciences of
men may be oblig'd to live innocently,
and quietly, both to their Governours,
and one towards another. And thus I
have diſpatch'd my Second Exception.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>Section III.</head>
                  <p>IN this Section I muſt conſider the laſt
exception againſt my aſſerting, that
the Rational powers could not be given to
man for any end, or good attainable in this
his preſent Life, and conſequently not for
the ſake only of his mortal duration. And
the Exception is thus ſuggeſted, that is,
that thoſe Rational Faculties may be
made uſe of, for the Excellent Office of
Contemplation, which in it ſelf is ſo great
a ſatisfaction to the mind, as that it may
make him truly happy, though they were
never improv'd for the concern of a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:42467:97"/>
Now the reaſon why I do the rather
oblige my ſelf to take notice of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
is, becauſe ſo great a man as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>
hath in his <hi>Ethicks</hi> ſo ſolicitouſly
contended to make Contemplation (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>)
a ſelf-ſufficient happineſs of human
life in this world.</p>
                  <p>But to ſhew the vanity of that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
abſtract from the uſe, that may be
made of it, with reſpect to that ſtate of
mind and life, which do neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the ſelf-ſufficient good of a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
World, I offer theſe ſeveral things
to conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt let it be inquir'd into, what ſuch
an operation of mind can, in it ſelf, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
do; and then I ſay, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
as men are diſpos'd to either Good
or Evil, ſo by their Contemplative Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
they may act wiſely or fooliſhly,
happily or unhappily for themſelves, as
they ſhall thinke fit to make uſe of it
for either. For by that power of the
mind, they can contemplate of God,
his Word, and Works, of Religion and
Vertue, and of the happy Events of both,
or of any innocent thing, that may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
conſiſt with their welfare in this
or a following World. And all this
may be done to the comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
of mens lives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:42467:97"/>
And then on the other ſide, by the
ſame Faculty, they may contemplate or
think on Things or Objects that do real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tend to their own miſfortune and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit.
That is, they may thereby be
projecting deſigns, and amaſſing heaps of
miſchief together againſt themſelves.
They may accumulatively augment their
own ſorrows in a fit of ſadneſs; and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time advance an <hi>Eutopian</hi> Joy, as idle
and inſignificant as a fond Dream. They
can thereby ſerve their fruitleſs Love, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
Fear, and the reſt of their affections
and paſſions, with imaginations, that are
accountable to no manner of Uſe or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
And all this may be done, and a
thouſand times worſe, to the diſcomfort
and uneaſineſs of their own minds and
lives, ſo that the faculty it ſelf is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon a pure indifferency, to act both
for the Good or Evil of him, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
his mind to make uſe of it for either.
Now if it ſhall appear, (as I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it) that no other Objects, upon
which it may be imploy'd, but ſuch as
bear a conſiſtency with what relates to
a Future World, as it's only proper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
why it ſhould ſo think or
contemplate, can poſſibly make any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for the real happineſs of humane
life, then what's become of the pretence


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42467:98"/>
of its ſelf-ſufficiency, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of ſuch a State to come?</p>
                  <p>And if it be ſaid, that that thinking
or contemplative power, may be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon Objects of this preſent life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the better to convenience a mans
worldly affairs, as that, by the uſe of it,
he may act them the more deliberately
and prudently; it's granted to be true
But then (if he deſigns any ſubſtantial
happineſs to himſelf, or ſatisfaction to
his thoughts) thoſe Contemplative or
Thinking operations, muſt be acted from
a mind that is generally influenc'd by the
hopes or fears of the events and iſſues of
a Future World, or it will meet the ſame
unſatisfactions in the obtaining ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
to which it's ſubject by the real
enjoyment of them. Of which an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
hath been already given, in the
firſt Chapter of this Argument.</p>
                  <p>And moreover, it may be alſo further
conſidered, that without ſuch a regard to
what's to come in that Future State, as
the ſame contemplative or thinking Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
when placed upon ſuch preſent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
may the better inable him for ſuch
advantageous ſucceſſes in his worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs;
ſo alſo it may capacitate him the
more ſubtlely to purſue his ends by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
methods; it may help and inable


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42467:98"/>
him to cheat and deceive, with more
artificial dexterities, as well as manage
with greater prudence. And how few are
there in the World, whom any other
principle can reſtrain, from ſuch unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
proceedures in their affairs, when
ſo vertuous a perſon as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſhould
affirm of himſelf, That if he could believe
there were no other world, he ſhould not
be affraid to do any thing that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt?
But the caſe is more fully manag'd
in the third Argument.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I anſwer, that as for <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's</hi>
way of Arguing for his notion of a
preſent (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as he calls it) ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Felicity, by the uſe and benefit of
a Rational Contemplation. If I could
poſſibly think that his Arguments were
not purely romantick, and as ſounded
upon a ſuppoſal of ſomthing, which is
altogether unaccountable upon any other
Reaſons, but ſuch, as muſt be deduc'd
from the believ'd acknowledgment of a
Future World, I ſhould chuſe to give an
attendance to every one of them. Upon
what other principle could any man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thoſe fits of contemplation, the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
with which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> adorns his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of that pretended felicity? As when


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42467:99"/>
he calls it, <hi>The moſt perfect Bleſſedneſs—the
beſt of all humane Actions
and Operations—and that
the man that exerciſeth
it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">—<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>—Lib. 10. Cap. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>is the moſt abſolutely
bleſſed;</hi> with ſuch like
Divine expreſſions, which can be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modable
to no other kind of happineſs,
but what is preſum'd to be enjoyable in
another world; or otherwiſe they can no
where be found, but in the regions where
ſpeculative impoſſibilities exiſt.</p>
                  <p>It's true, I ſolemnly grant, that if our
Contemplator be religiouſly diſpos'd, and
is hopefully ſenſible, that his Life and
Actions are pleaſing and acceptable to
the Mighty GOD, and ſo bear a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to his happineſs in another World;
I ſay, I then grant and believe, that ſuch
a mans contemplation, when he is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
upon the regularity of his own
actions, the excellencies of GOD's Love
and Favour, and is recounting the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of that Joy and Peace, Love and
Society, which he ſhall meet withal in
the other World, may attain to ſuch a
degree of his minds ſatisfaction, as may
very nearly accord with the Philoſophers
high appellations of ſuch a thinking Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:42467:99"/>
But then, on the other hand, if the
contemplative power be acted by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that is vitiouſly and immorally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
there is no peradventure, but he
imploys it to his own greater infelicity.
That is, he will be apt either to devour
his own contentment with invidious or
revengeful Thoughts, or be creating his
diſquiet with anxious Cares, or needleſs
Fears, or with the like deſtructive Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of his Mind: Or, if we ſuppoſe
it to be acted by one that is of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive
and vertuous Humour (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which ſuppoſition I conceive the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
did principally found his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the contemplative Happineſs)
yet if that man ſhall reſolv'dly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
no thoughts at all of, or be in no
manner concern'd for, the events of a
Future World, it muſt be preſum'd, that
he will be moſt apt always to think at
beſt, worldly, if not altogether vainly and
impertinently, and in the manner of men,
that are always talking idly, and to no
purpoſe. Whereas, that Religion which
relates to a Future World, will oblige
him to make Conſcience of his inward
Thoughts, as well as of his overt Actions;
and for ſome Reaſons, and in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
it will be found his Duty to give
his greater attendance to avoid thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42467:100"/>
of his thinking Mind.</p>
                  <p>And now, how otherwiſe can our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptioner
imagine, that the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Faculty, that GOD gave Mankind,
ſhould be reſtrained from ſuch abſurdities,
or that his Thinking Mind, that is always
buſily at work upon one Object or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſhould be able to confine it ſelf to
ſuch only, as tend to Vertue, and his
own ſatisfactory Good and Happineſs,
when his own unruly Paſſions and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Appetites within him, and the
looſe and vain World without him, will
be perpetually ſoliciting him to be think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thoſe other objects, that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
make him unhappy, except it be
from the grand encouragement of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his future and principal Intereſt in
another World? And for a fuller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of this Truth, my Reader
may reſpit his Thoughts till he is ingaged
in the Third Argument intended for that
purpoſe. This the laſt Exception.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have accounted with my
Sceptick for all his three Exceptions, and
I think we have loſt no ground in the
defence of my aſſertion, That the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
faculties, and intellectual mind of
Man, were not given him of GOD,
for the ſake, ends, and intendments of
his Mortal Duration only; but upon a


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42467:100"/>
more eſpecial purpoſe, and principally
for the ſake of another World. And
that is the buſineſs of the next Chapter
to prove.</p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter I ſhall endeavour to
evince poſitively, That thoſe Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Faculties were principally, and
upon the moſt eſpecial purpoſe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Mankind, for the ſake, ends, and
intendments of another World. And
that, when they are exerciſed in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Operations, about the attainment
of the happineſs of that ſtate, (it will
appear) they will be then engaged in
their own moſt proper and natural bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
and imployments.</p>
               <p>Now, the moſt reaſonable method to
be undertaken, to demonſtrate a Truth of
this nature, will be to ſhew, That the
Reaſons offer'd in the Firſt Chapter, why
thoſe Faculties were not given to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
for the ſake of this Life only,
(which muſt have been true, if there
were no other to ſucceed) are perfectly

                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:42467:101"/>
And, becauſe thoſe Reaſons were three
eſpecially, I ſhall therefore confront them
in the ſame number and method, in ſo
many Sections for that purpoſe.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Section I.</head>
                  <p>IN this Section, I ſhall remind the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the firſt Defailance of thoſe
Rational Faculties, upon which I founded
my Firſt Reaſon, to prove that they were
not given to Man for the ſake only of his
mortal Life; and that was, becauſe the
enjoyments of it could not afford the
mind any ſettled or ſufficient ſatisfaction,
though a man were moſt proſperouſly
poſſeſſed of them, much leſs provide for
him any ſolid contentment, through the
various Turns and Exigencies of humane
life. And then I alſo ſhew'd, That
though ſuch Enjoyments might for a time
naturally gratifie the inferiour part of a
Man's ſelf, yet that by the impropriety and
unalliance they bear to the Rational and
Supream part of his Being, (which is
moſt properly himſelf) they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
affect the Mind with any real or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodable
acquieſcence, or natural
ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:42467:101"/>
Now, to confront that defailance, it
will evidently appear, That when thoſe
Rational Faculties are made uſe of, to
judge and chuſe the Intereſt of another
World, as Man's chiefeſt Good; and then
be actually engaged for that vertuous
and religious way of living, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
tends to the obtaining the happineſs
of that ſtate, they will be found experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
to enjoy as much eaſe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to themſelves, as the mind of
Man is capable of in this life; and as
Objects, whoſe completion ſtands at ſuch
a diſtance, can poſſibly affect it. And
thoſe faculties will then as naturally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce
in their operations, when they are
ſo imploy'd and engag'd, as do neceſſary
Agents, when they attain thoſe ends, to
which, by natural inſtinct, they were
oblig'd: Or, as when the outward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are exercis'd in their operations, about
their proper Objects.</p>
                  <p>But my attending Sceptick will here
except, and ſay, That all theſe are but
precarious Preſumptives only; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can carry no certain Evidence
for demonſtration or conviction. To
this Exception I ſhall anſwer, Firſt, That
the laſt Argument will give a fuller and
more natural account of this Caſe, (being
its moſt peculiar buſineſs) to which I


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42467:102"/>
muſt referr my Reader, to prevent my
ſaying the ſame things over again.</p>
                  <p>But then, Secondly, I anſwer, That I
ſhall in this place only offer one ſingle
Expedient, and it's as conſiderable to our
purpoſe, as ſuch a caſe can poſſibly bear
to evince a Truth of this nature; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the mind can only be convicted in
its ſelf, as to what it underſtands or
thinks, and can't convince another, but
upon the credit of its own diſcovery.
And the Expedient is this, <hi>viz.</hi> A Solemn
Appeal to the Faith, Conſcience, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of any of thoſe men, who have
been generally obſerv'd to live habitual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a courſe and ſtate of Vertue and
Piety; and that have ſolemnly profeſſed
themſelves, by word and deed, to eſpouſe
the happineſs of another World, as their
principal and governing Intereſt; I ſay,
to ſuch a kind of perſon (be it whom my
Exceptioner will, that can think and
ſpeak underſtandingly) I ſolemnly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
to declare upon his conſcience, what
Senſe he hath had of his choice of ſuch
an Intereſt, and of all thoſe Actions, and
of that way of Living, which (upon the
common agreement of all unprejudic'd
Minds) do naturally conduce to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of a Future World: That is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he did ever repent himſelf, when his


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42467:102"/>
mind was free to judge, of the choice of
that Future Intereſt; or that ever he
continued in any diſlike, or ſerious diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions
of mind, about any vertuous
deſigns or practices, which he had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
to promote and act? Or, whether
he was not generally pleas'd with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
while he led his life ſtrictly in that
manner, and only then apt to be troubl'd,
if at any time he had been ſurpriz'd into
a neglect of his Duty, or inadvertently
overcome by the ſtrength of any Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
to omit or do any thing that
might abate his hope of his future Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Or, whether at any time, if he were
afflicted with Sickneſs, or any other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
circumſtances, his mind did not
then retire into its ſelf, and find there
Reaſons reſulting from its religious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
to ſupport his preſſures with more
content and patient ſatisfaction? I ſay,
if ſuch a good man's ſenſe and judgment
may be believ'd to be true, it's eaſie to
underſtand what thoſe objects are, and
what manner of Enjoyments thoſe muſt
needs be, with which the Rational mind
ſhould be thus ſatisfactorily affected and
pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>But my <hi>Sceptick</hi> hath yet more to except,
and tells me, That all this may be nothing
elſe but either the effect of an Enthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42467:103"/>
Imagination, or otherwiſe vitiated
Fancy, whereby the man's Reaſon may
be ſo diſorder'd, as that himſelf (how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſoever) ſhould not be a competent
Judge even of his own Sentiments. To
this my anſwer is, That I grant, that there
is ſuch a poſſibility of a man's being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
deceiv'd in his own thoughts; but if
that were accounted at all times ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to controul every affirmative Truth
that depends upon a man's Solemn diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his own mind, there would want
one of the moſt conſiderable Expedients,
by which the World is to be kept in Peace,
and regular Communion. And beſides,
it would be conſidered, that ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd
Reaſon as our Exceptioner men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
muſt be preſum'd to carry its own
ſymptoms with it, and ſo be eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
for the invalidation of the credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of what he affirms. But we offer our
Exceptioner to ſtand to the ſenſe and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch an one, whoſe well-weigh'd
underſtanding in the management of all
other his Actions, can over-rule all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ſuſpicion of ſuch an uncertain
imagination. But then again, replies our
Caviller, Such a man's Integrity may be
call'd in queſtion, and Who knows how far
Hypocriſie may be baited with Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Honour, Friendſhip, or other Worldly


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42467:103"/>
Ends, to put on all manner of taking-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes
of Religion, and amongſt the reſt
this in debate? My anſwer to this is
much the ſame with the former, that is,
That ſuch a falſe mind hath its certain
Symptoms, as well as a diſorder'd Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
by which the diſſimulation may be
detected, and the affirmation may be
judg'd invalid. And therefore, if we
grant, That when we thus appeal to the
Faith and Conſcience of a Good man,
concerning the inward Satisfaction of
his Soul in his Religious Courſe, that we
may poſſibly meet an Enthuſiaſtick, or
an Hypocrite, affirming the ſame thing;
yet our arguing in this caſe runs no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
at all, the largeneſs of our Appeal
ſuperſedes all danger of being disbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
for unleſs all that live piouſly in
the World, be Enthuſiaſticks or Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
that is, Fools or Knaves; we can't
miſcarry in this point of Proof. And
though ſome ſuch Good men, ſometimes
in a Fit of deep Melancholy, occaſion'd
generally by the ill-diſpoſition of their
Bodies; or by ſome unhappy Principles
imbib'd in their Education; or elſe by too
nice and ſenſible an apprehenſion of their
own infirmities, (which for want of a
clear Judgment, they can't at preſent
ſolve) may for a time deprive themſelves


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42467:104"/>
of the comfort of their own happy ſtate:
Yet, to be ſure, the ground of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort
never aroſe from any unkind ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of their being vertuous and
religious, or for their choice of another
World's Intereſt, as their principal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;
but rather they were troubled
from a Fear they were not good enough,
or that their hopes of their future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
were not ſo ſufficiently aſſur'd to
their thoughts, as they deſir'd. And in
the ſaddeſt poſture of mind, we ſhall ever
find ſuch Good men, (we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd)
that they will never loſe their
ſerious approbation of Vertue and Piety,
and that they will be alwaies ready to
declare, That a religious Converſation is
incomparably preferrable to the living,
in a ſtate of Sin, though attended with
all the proſperous advantages of humane
Life; and if put to competition and
choice, would, without any further
doubt, embrace ſuch a Converſation at
all adventures.</p>
                  <p>And, Laſtly, We are ſo ſecure of the
Truth of all Good mens ſatisfactions of
Mind, while they continue in their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
engagements and practices, in order
to their happineſs in another World, that
we dare thus far appeal to moſt Evil
men, even in their worſt ſenſual habits,


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42467:104"/>
when they have at any time admitted
their own minds to ſerious Thoughts,
(which the worſt ſort of ſuch men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
alwaies eſcape) to declare, Whether
they did not then think, that it were much
happier for them to have lived otherwiſe,
and in an habitual courſe of Vertue; and
then alſo moſt heartily wiſh, that their
Children, for whom they have the moſt
endear'd regard, might ſo live?</p>
                  <p>Now, Whence can all this be, but that
ſuch religious engagements and hopes
are in themſelves naturally accommodable
to the intellectual powers of the Soul?
And that, if at any time they be reduced
and over-rul'd to embrace the Objects
that are proper only to the inferiour and
ſenſual Part of Man, it will become ſo
unnatural to the ſuperiour mind, that
there will be a kind of violence done to
it; and like Animals out of their own
Elements, and like Inanimates out of their
proper places, it can never have any reſt
or true ſatisfaction, till its Operations be
entertain'd and made uſe of, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of Vertue and a Future World. This
the Firſt.</p>

                  <head>Section II.</head>
                  <p>IN this Section, I ſhall endeavour to
confront the ſecond defailance of the
Rational Faculties, upon which I foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a reaſon to evince, that they were
not given, for the Sake, Ends, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments
of Mans mortal life only, and
that was, becauſe all the proper Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
and neceſſary Conſtitutives of mans
Well-being in this world, and which are
univerſally celebrated as ſuch, were not
by Divine ordination certainly, if at all
really, placed in mens power, by the uſe
of thoſe faculties, to obtain them when
they did moſt diligently ſeek after them,
or ſpecially need them. But to ſolve this
defect to our preſent purpoſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to demonſtrate, that the intereſt and
intendments of another world, were the
principal End why God Almighty gave
thoſe Rational qualifications to mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it will appeare, that the choice of
the other worlds happineſs, and the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
performance of all ſuch Vertuous and
Religious methods, as naturally conduce
to the aſſur'd acquiſition of it, are all
placed in mens capacities by the uſe of
thoſe intellectual powers, as ſufficiently


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42467:105"/>
to underſtand and judge, ſo alſo as deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
to chuſe and put in practice at their
own free election.</p>
                  <p>It was before ſuggeſted, that every
man could not at his choice, and upon
his beſt endeavour be certainly Rich and
Healthful, live Proſperouſly and Peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
when he pleas'd: But no man in
his Wits can queſtion, if he allows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the free uſe of his Reaſons Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
(which the intereſt and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of another worlds happineſs can at
all times admit him to, as will be made
evident in the next Argument) he may
live Vertuouſly and Religiouſly if he will
reſolve upon it, and diligently attend it?
What can hinder his Pious intentions, or
prevent his Vertuous reſolutions, or fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
their conſequent Happy events, but
his own wilful refuſal, ſo to live and act?
he can always, in the midſt of all diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
act Juſtly and Honeſtly, live
Soberly and Peaceably, and do any thing
elſe, that may diſpoſe him for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of another life, if he will improve
the uſe of his choiſe by ſuch Counſels,
as his underſtanding mind can ſuggeſt to
him. Of that poſſibility he is ſecure. But
he cannot always act ſucceſsfully in his
neareſt concerns for his mortal Well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of thoſe advantages he hath natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42467:106"/>
no aſſurance. What man can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of enjoying one hours Health more,
or of Bread for another daies ſubſiſtence,
or of his very Life for three moments
to come? A thouſand unthought of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
may diſcontinue his poſſeſſion of
thoſe, and all other his preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and it were an unexcuſable Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in him, if he did not allow his mind
a liberty ſo to think. But all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
whether Devils or Men, cannot,
by all the power they have, diſſeize him
of his Vertuous purpoſes, and an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and religious Mind, unleſs he will
wilfully chuſe to conſent to his own
miſchief, and deſignedly become his own
deadly Foe and Traytor; if he turns not
firſt his own Devil, the powers of Hell
can never hurt him.</p>
                  <p>It's true, the great man may diſcharge
him of his imployment to his undoing,
and he may throw him upon his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Malice and Revenge to his Ruin,
but it is not in his power to deprive
him of his Patience, or his Charity; of
his Juſtice or Sobriety, or of any other
vertuous or religious Qualifications, or
Intendments whatſoever: Of thoſe,
GOD hath made him naturally His
own Soveraign and Maſter, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of no other Being, to raviſh or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
them from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:42467:106"/>
Upon the ſuppoſition of this Truth,
it is, That all wiſe and good Men do
account it not only unkind, but very
barbarous, to reflect upon, or upbraid
the Unfortunate, as to this world; that
is, they don't reproach Men that are
unhealthful, or contemptible, poor or
deform'd, becauſe they can't tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch unhappy men could ever have
avoided thoſe hard and oppreſſive circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of their lives; but every one is
ready to blame and accuſe thoſe that are
impious and immoral, becauſe they are
ſure, that ſuch men muſt act their own
miſcarriages and miſfortunes, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to the uſe they might have made
of their own underſtandings; and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to that poſſibility of living other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
which God Almighty had as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
allowed them, as that ever he had
given them any Rational Minds at all, or
Natural Capacities to improve it.</p>
                  <p>And if that poſſibility were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them, it would be not only a
diſparagement to the Divine Goodneſs,
but it would ſo evacuate all manner of
real obligation to be good or vertuous,
as that there could not be in moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
any ſuch thing as Vertue or
Vice at all; much leſs any true reaſon
of Reward or Puniſhment, from any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42467:107"/>
Judge or Arbiter whatſoever.
And therefore as an Evil man, if he
could not have voluntarily avoided his
being Vitious, ought not in juſtice to be
reputed a criminal, ſo neither can any
one that is Vertuous, if he might not have
been otherwiſe if he would, have any
more juſt title to that denomination, than
if one ſhould go about to applaud the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
of a Stone or Flower.</p>
                  <p>Now, if our Exceptioner ſhould alledge,
That that diſtinction between things in
and out of our Power and Choice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
only upon a Scheme of a Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
formally digeſted, the more ſpeciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to impoſe upon mens credulity, as in
others, ſo in this particular Caſe.</p>
                  <p>My anſwer is, that I ſhall prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,

of the truth of that diſtinction,
upon which I have endeavour'd to found
the main ſtreſs of my Second Reaſon, why
thoſe Rational Faculties were principally,
and on the moſt ſpecial purpoſe given to

of a Future World. And that was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
whatſoever is ſuppoſed to conduce

                  <p>IN which I am oblig'd to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the third Defailance of the
Intellectual and Rational Faculties (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in the Third Section of the
Firſt Chapter) when they are imploy'd
and engaged in their uſe and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the concerns only of Man's
mortal duration. And that was becauſe
it's obſerv'd, when a man's Mind and
Life are wholly taken up for the ends,
purpoſes, and enjoyments of that ſtate,
without any regard at all to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to the events of a Future World,
ſuch a perſon will hardly eſcape his
doing many, if not moſt things, that
upon the account of Rational Judgment,
muſt at beſt be but vain and trifling, if
not (as it moſt generally falls out) direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

we endeavour'd to found a Reaſon to
prove, That thoſe Faculties of the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

Mankind for the ſake, ends, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their mortal Durations only;


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42467:109"/>
which muſt be ſo, if no World in Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

thoſe Faculties were given principally,

that Future State, it will manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
That when Men do engage thoſe

and ſuch as will become the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Dignity of a Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
So that, by the regularity of ſuch
a Conduct, they ſhall never habitually
continue to think, ſpeak, or do any thing
that is abſurd or fooliſh, or of which they
ſhall ever have cauſe to repent, to their
own ſhame and ſorrow. And therefore
it is concluſively true, That to be Wiſe
and Good; to live Religiouſly and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly;
to act by the Influence of a
Future States Belief, and by the Conduct
of right Reaſon; do all, as to practice,
import the ſame purpoſe, and do all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the ſame meaſures and ways of
living.</p>
                  <p>And here, by the way, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a wonderful Contrivance of Mercy


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42467:109"/>
in our Good and Wiſe GOD, that He
ſhould pleaſe ſo far to conſult, not only
the poſſibility, but even the eaſineſs of
Man's attaining his Chiefeſt Good and
Felicity, as that the Conditionals and
Methods of its attainment ſhould be ſo
accommodable to the Powers and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of his Nature, that the diſcretion and
prudence of his very mortal life ſhould ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
depend upon his deſigns and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to be made Happy in another World.</p>
                  <p>But if an Exception ſhould be here
offer'd againſt this Obſervation, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,
That there may perhaps be as
many men, who acknowledge the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
of a future State, and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
do pretend to the hopes of being
Bleſſed in that Life, that do as many
abſurd and fooliſh things as other
men. My Anſwer is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That probably ſome ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may but ſeem ſo, in the invidious
or miſtaken opinion of Worldly and
Senſual Men. But then,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If many actions of ſuch Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
ſhould happen to be really fooliſh,
yet they muſt be then preſum'd to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
only in their Wiſdom, when they
kept not to the plain Paths of Vertue,
and oppoſed the natural Influence, which
the Faith and Hopes of another World


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42467:110"/>
might have made upon their Minds and
Lives. Had they been ſteady in their
Actings for that end, they had never
ceaſed to be Wiſe, as well as Good. So
that mens deviation from the Rules of
Religion, doth not only make them Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in Guilt, but makes them Fools in
Practice and real Notion.</p>
                  <p>But, becauſe this general and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
way of Arguing may be thought
unſufficient for Conviction; therefore, as
before, my merry Neighbour dreſs'd up
for me a parcel of ſilly Worldlings, and
Senſualliſts, that were adventuring for
a preſent pretended Happineſs, in their
proper Sportful Garbs, ſuch as for their
Follies they deſerv'd to wear: So, now
let my ſerious Thoughts attempt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of that man's Wiſdom, who
hath improv'd his intellectual powers, to
think and live the intent and intereſt of
another World. Let me delineate, in
ſhort, his beauty and comelineſs in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Limb, and draw up an abbreviate Plat
and Scheme of his whole Life's wiſdom
and felicity, in every Relation he bears
to Society, and in every quality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Life, by which he is acting his
particular part, with reſpect to his own
Perſonal Happineſs in the Scene of his
Mortality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:42467:110"/>
Firſt, I ſhall begin with him in the
inſtances of all his Social Capacities, and
that becauſe his Prudence and Felicity is
therein the more remarkably expreſs'd
and enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>And the firſt ſhall be of that, which
concerns the greateſt of his Social Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts.
And then I demand of Mankind
to judge, whether the man muſt not be
accounted Wiſe and Happy, who never
was juſtly expoſed to the hazard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought upon the Stage for any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Words, or Mutinous Practices?
That never could be charg'd for running
a Nation into Blood and Confuſion, by
endeavouring to diſarm his Prince of that
Sword, by which he ſhould be able to
protect his People, from acting that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon one another, to the loſs of
their univerſal peace and ſafety. And
that did never go about to ſtarve the
Government, and as it were, to tie up
its Hands, and make it uncapable to
preſerve it Self, till a foreign Enemy
ſhould uſurp upon the Nations Peace and
Honour. Nor that ever could be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of a fordid Neutrality at any time,
when his Prince's juſt Cauſe was in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
This is that wiſdom, in which
his Religion and a conſcience of his Duty
to GOD muſt inſtruct him, againſt all


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42467:111"/>
Temptations of diſcontent and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to act the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Or, (which is next in concern for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Wiſdom) Is not he a wiſe and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
man, that hath choſen to bear a part
in a neighbourhood of univerſal Peace;
where, if every one were conducted by
a Religious Fear of GOD, there can be
no ſuch offence given or taken as may
at any time interrupt it? Where Juſtice
acts every ones right, and Mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
for every ones need: Where all
are obliging one another with mutual
Civilities and Kindneſs; and with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and reciprocal defence and guard
of every Neighbour's Peace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties.</p>
                  <p>Or, (which is the laſt caſe of Social
Prudence and Felicity) Is not he truly
Wiſe, who acts his part in a Family of
an Angelick Communion; That is,
where nothing inhabits, but quiet, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
and contentment: where every
one in the Houſe is conſtantly acting
the Offices and Duties of his proper
Place and Relation: where there be no
brawls, jealouſies, or ſpightful intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;
but the whole Houſe is full of
ſweet joy, and mutual endearments of
Reſpect and Love?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:42467:111"/>
Now, if we enquire what it is, upon
the account of which, we may adjudge
every Member of thoſe Societies to be
ſo Wiſe and Happy as I have repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, the whole reaſon of it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious;
for it is no more, but that every
one that bears a part in ſuch Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
would be Good, and make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
his main concern, and the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a Future World his principal
aim and intereſt, and the buſineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ado, is done. It is nothing
but mens deviations from thoſe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and practices, that can expoſe any
Societies to thoſe Follies, which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
diſorder the happy compoſure
of all Communions.</p>
                  <p>But to come to an Examination of that
Wiſdom, which in a more Perſonal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
concerns Mankind. And then I
demand again, whether is not that man
truly Wiſe and Happy, who admits Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
to the government of all his
meals in the day, and that at night lays
himſelf down to ſleep upon a chaſt Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
and that regulates all other his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
actions by a rational judgment?</p>
                  <p>And, Is not he the ſame, that can
keep up the credit of an unſuſpected
fidelity, and never offended God or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Ears, with loud Oaths and Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42467:112"/>
upon a vain, yet generally an
unſucceſsful pretence, the better to
ſecure it? And then, Whoſe peaceful
and placable Soul can, upon the greateſt
provocations, ſo allay his Paſſions, as not
to incumber his mind with any trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Intrigues of Revenge; and, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
to prevent the chargeable atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances,
with which the Laws vexatious
periods do too much afflict the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
World?</p>
                  <p>And, Muſt not Mankind judge him
Wiſe and Happy, that doth not perplex
his mind with ſuch anxious cares and
fears, as may create in him an habitual
diſcontent, about the meaſures of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
quality and manner of ſubſiſtence?
That is, That can really and ſatisfactori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
judge his Allotted Habitation, (of
what figure ſoever it is) as acceptable
to himſelf, as the Great man's ſplendid
Palace; And be ſo fully content with
the little Income he enjoys, as never to
wiſh with a ſigh to be Maſter of another
man's more plentiful Fortune: And
withal, who makes the moſt ſubſtantial
aſſurance for the continuance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of his own; and for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for his Children when he's gone;
of whoſe welfare he contentedly judgeth
himſelf as certain, as that GOD Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42467:112"/>
hath paſs'd His Promiſe for it?
And there be them that have challeng'd
the World to give any famous inſtances
of the non-performance of His Word.</p>
                  <p>But, ſuppoſe our Good man to be
plac'd by Providence in the Loweſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and that he muſt labour for his
daily Subſiſtence; Is not he as wiſe
and Happy as his quality can admit,
whoſe peaceful Soul and pious Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can make his ſweet Sleep in the
night compenſate for his wearineſs in
the day; and that can take a greater
pleaſure in the hautgouſt of his dearly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earn'd
Bread, than thoſe Senſualliſts can
do, when they are daily puffing over
their nauſeating Varieties? Whoſe cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
dependance upon God, to provide
for his Children, ſuperſedes all manner
of anxious ſolicitude; knowing that for
their concern, he ſhall not be affected
with thoſe incumbrances of mind to
which the Rich are ſubject, when they
are torturing their heads with feares of
having their Honours at preſent, and their
Fortunes afterwards, ſhipwrack'd, to
promote their Children in the World.
To be ſhort, This is the man that's ſo
wiſe, that his Innocency gives him Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs;
his meekneſs begets him Love,
and his Fidelity, Truſt; whoſe Induſtry


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42467:113"/>
gains him Imployment, and his Honeſty
ſuch a Friendſhip, as may ſupport him
till he hath ended his Labours, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd
them for a perpetual Reſt. Now
that Poor man, that cheriſheth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
hope of another Worlds Happineſs,
and lives according to the expectation
of it, cannot but be ſuch an one as I
have deſcrib'd him; and then, Who
lives, that is Wiſer and Happier than he?</p>
                  <p>And, Doth not that man deſerve the
reputation of being Wiſe, who lives ſo
inoſſenſively, as ſtoutly to defie all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of inſtances of ſhame or covert; to
whom a Whiſperer, or the invidious ſeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies
of the malicious, can give no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern;
That is not ſolicitous, if the doors
of his whole Soul ſtood alwaies unlock'd,
or that all the moral actions of his Life
lay common to every Eye; and whoſe
innocency renders a falſe rumour, or a
cauſeleſs accuſation, ſo far from being a
vexation to him, that he only heartily
pities the follies of mens malice, and by
a ready forgiveneſs, permits not his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to forment and arreſt his ſleep, or
at any time to diſorder the ſteady tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of his mind?</p>
                  <p>Further, Is not he a Wiſe and Happy
man, who, when the World is alarm'd
with the evil Tidings of National Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42467:113"/>
abroad, or that lives amidſt the
Broils of a divided ſtate at home, can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernedly
diſcharge his mind of all
afflictive Fears, by an entire reſignation
of his Thoughts to God, to bring about
what events he thinks fit; and then that
alwaies cheerfully interprets, that all
things ſhall be well with him in the end,
whatſoever God ſhall pleaſe ſhould come
to paſs?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Is not he highly wiſe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who hath provided before-hand a
Store of Contentment to ſupport his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
when Sickneſs, or any kind of
Miſfortune ſhall invade his Health, or
impair his Plenty? And that hath laid
up ſuch a ſtock of Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in his mind, as may be alwaies
ready to relieve his unpleaſant Thoughts,
when he ſhall begin to feel his Clay-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
reel with age; and when his
Life is grown incumber'd with the ſence
of all its decaying circumſtances? And
then, that can fearleſly make the gradual
approaches of his laſt and neceſſary pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
to be thought only ſo many ſteps
of advance towards his everlaſting Reſt,
and the bliſsful ſtate of a following world.
And finally, when he is come to the laſt
point of his mortality, that hath no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
of doubt about <hi>A Future World's


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42467:114"/>
Exiſtence;</hi> that hath upon his Soul no
ſuch guilt, as may ruffle his Thoughts
with the amazing fears of the Divine
Vengeance; nor doth any Horrour ſieze
his ſteady Hope? And in the laſt gaſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moments, when the World's Factors
for preſent Pleaſures and Proſperity, are
with a diſordered reaſon uttering the
broken Expreſſions of their laſt and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Farewel; then ſhall our Wiſe man
be admiring his mighty Creator's Love
and Goodneſs, with ſuch a joy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
as ſhall, if not wholly remove,
yet ſo allay all the natural Terrours of
Dying, that he ſhall go out of the world
as cheerfully as a Traveller, when he hath
reach'd his home; and ſhall leave all
his mortal affairs and enjoyments behind
him, with the ſame unconcernedneſs that
a Pilgrim removes from his laſt nights
Lodging.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have drawn a reſemblance to
the Life, of that man's Wiſdom, whoſe
Mind and Life are govern'd by the great
Intereſt of another World, and by the
Rules of ſuch a Converſation as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
conduce to the attainment of it.
And though it can't be preſum'd, that
he ſhould eſcape all humane inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies,
and caſual miſtakes in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of his habitual Vertue and


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42467:114"/>
Piety, (to which the beſt of men are
ſubjected, and) which may ſomewhat
abate the perfection of an abſolute Beauty,
yet thoſe errours being no parts, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpots in the Feature, the comelineſs of
the repreſentation may nevertheleſs not
be the leſs acceptable, and perhaps the
more graceful, becauſe it's the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and genuine figure of a Good man
on this ſide of a Future World.</p>
                  <p>But all this while, I have almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
to confront what I offer'd in the
<hi>Third Section</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Chapter,</hi> where
arguing, That the Rational Faculties
were not likely to be given to Mankind
in their uſe and operations for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
buſineſs, and ends of Man's mortal
Life only, becauſe it was generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
That where there was no concern
at all for another World, and that men
acted according to the influence of ſuch
an unconcernment, the greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that ſuch men had of either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexional
or acquir'd intellectual Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
their degeneracies to Folly would
moſt commonly appear to be ſo much
the greater and fouler, and their actions
and practices ſo much the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
abſurd and fooliſh.</p>
                  <p>And now, to improve our preſent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
for a future World, and to ſhow,


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42467:115"/>
That thoſe Rational Faculties were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
and on purpoſe, given on that
account, we can affirm, That it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
obſerv'd, that as Good mens minds
are advanced with more knowing quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
and ingenious underſtandings, ſo
they do generally act their vertuous and
religious Intendments, with a Wiſdom
incomparably above the common mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of ſuch as are qualified but with
ordinary endowments, though thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhould be in no degree inferiour to
the moſt ingenious, in the uprightneſs of
their minds and lives. For ſuch mens
knowing judicious managery of their
Vertues, will not only create a bare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptableneſs
of, but they muſt give a
conſpicuous Luſtre to their lives and
practices: by which they will ſo adorn
all the exerciſes of their Goodneſs, that
they cannot eſcape their being ſpecially
mark'd out for Love and Honour.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, ſuch men do not only
live the End, but the Honour of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and by their wiſe and unblameable
converſations, they take off thoſe preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
and exceptions that are daily offer'd
againſt Religion it Self, to which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretions
of men of ordinary capacities
may have oftentimes expos'd it. But,
among all the ſignal Excellencies that


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42467:115"/>
attend and adorn an ingenious Piety,
there is nothing more remarkable, than
the wiſe uſe and diſpoſure of Time; which
like the Rational Faculties themſelves,
was principally given to Mankind, for
the imployment of what concerns a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
World: And it's for want of that
proper buſineſs, that it ſo often becomes
uneaſie and burdenſome to ſuch men, as
are in no order of mind to make uſe of
it for that eſpecial purpoſe; and that
ſometimes to ſuch a degree of uneaſineſs,
that their very Lives themſelves grow
tireſome to their own Thoughts. So
that were it not for that reaſon, that
Time was allow'd Man principally for
the ſake of another World to ſolve the
doubt, it would make one ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to think, that Creatures endow'd
with a Rational Underſtanding, ſhould
ever condeſcend to imploy it about acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are ſometimes ſo troubleſome
and uneaſie, and at other times ſo chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
and ſilly, that they bear no more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
manly ends, than the dancing
of a bubble, or the purſuit of a Fly.
Hence it is, that men unconcern'd for a
Future World do ſometimes ſwine away
their Time in drink and debaucheries;
while others are trifling off their precious
hours in Courtſhips and Gallantings, in


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42467:116"/>
nicer dreſſings, and other ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
And to be ſure they all muſt ſleep
away the ſweet mornings, leſt that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſeaſon ſhould attack their minds
with the ſenſe of their midnight foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Theſe, and ſuch as theſe, are the
pitiful ſhifts which men unconcern'd for
a Future Life are fain to buſy their
time away with ſomething that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Now, on the other hand, How happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will men, whoſe minds are advanc'd
in higher degrees of thinking and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
underſtandingly, when they are really
Vertuous and Good! I ſay, How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
will thoſe men be able to engage
themſelves in ſuch a wiſe managery of
their time, as may ſecure them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from finding it a burden to their own
Thoughts, but from being tempted to
throw it away upon ſuch unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
miſadventures. To prevent which
inconveniencies, they can ingeniouſly
methodize their time into various Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and ſucceſſively diſtinct Periods,
the better to alleviate the ſlow Progreſs
of their hours. That is, they can ſet
out theſe days and hours for Devotion;
Thoſe for the Offices of doing Good,
or for ſecular imployments; and then
ſome for keeping up friendſhip and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42467:116"/>
converſation; others again for inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
recreations and divertiſement. All
which wiſe diviſions of Time, will ſhut
out all occaſions of its diſimprovement
to weak and ſilly purpoſes; and which
being once made eaſie by an habituated
regular obſervation, they ſhall as delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
reciprocate thoſe ſeveral Duties in
their proper ſeaſon, as they do their
Meals or times of Reſt.</p>
                  <p>And then all this while, how pleaſant
and ſatisfactory will the uſe of time thus
wiſely, becauſe religiouſly manag'd, be to
their own Minds and Conſciences? And
with what a raviſhing contentment will
they recount such ſpent hours, when old
Age ſhall allow them little elſe to do,
but to think of what is paſt? But then
chiefly, How will ſuch Thoughts alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
the horrour of their dying Scene,
when they ſhall go out of the World
with Minds full of Hopes of the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Returns of a well-ſpent Time
and Life?</p>
                  <p>And now having diſpatch'd the deſign
and import of this Laſt Section, Who is
it that can call in queſtion the judgment
of the Sacred <hi>Revelation,</hi> when it ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
declares the diſtinction of the Good
and Evil, by the ſevere diſcrimination
of Wiſe and Fool; or, that Repentance

               <p>THat is, if it be ſufficiently proved,
that the Rational Faculties of Mans
mind, by which he is eſſentially himſelf,
were not given by Almighty GOD to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
for the Sake, Ends, and Intendments
only of their Mortal Lives; as it appears
in the Firſt Chapter:</p>
               <p>And if thoſe pretentions for a ſufficient

to a mans Mortal Life be as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
over-ruled and anſwered, as it is in
the Second Chapter:</p>
               <p>And then if it be poſitively proved, as in
the Third Chapter, that thoſe Faculties were
given to Mankind, principally, and on the

what can be ſuggeſted to Doubt, but that God

               <p>THE Third Argument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the real Exiſtence
of a Future State is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a Conſideration,
That if Man's Being ſhould extend no
further than the Boundary of his Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Life, and that there were no other
World, whoſe Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
might affect his preſent Hope
and Fear; then it muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
That he can have no ſufficient
encouragements; that is, no ſufficient
Reaſons (they being both the ſame in
this caſe to Rational and free Agent)
to oblige himſelf to live a Vertuous Life.
Which conſequence being true, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but reflect upon the Wiſdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and Goodneſs of <hi>GOD,</hi> who


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42467:120"/>
by His ſovereign Will and Pleaſure,
gave him that limitted Duration; and
then oblig'd naturally to enjoy his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſuch ſocial Communions, whoſe
univerſal Wel-fare ſhould neceſſarily
depend upon Mens living Vertuouſly one
with another: and yet in which ſocial
World, it was not poſſible for him to
meet any ſufficient Encouragements or
Reaſons to oblige him ſo to live. And
if nothing elſe can ſolve the Vindication
of thoſe Divine Attributes, but only
the acknowledg'd Exiſtence of a Future
State, whoſe Rewards and Puniſhments,
being propos'd to the mind of Man,
may be ſufficient encouragements or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
why be ſhould live ſuch a Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Life: then it's certain, that <hi>GOD</hi>
Almighty hath ordain'd and conſtituted
ſuch a Future World.</p>
               <p>Now there being many parts of this
Argument, which will require ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable

                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:42467:120"/>

to ſet free the terms and ſenſe of the
Argument in general, as it's in the whole

               <p>In the Second Chapter, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

againſt the inference of the concluſion by

               <p>In the Third Chapter, Reaſons will

               <p>IN which I deſign ſomething, that
may be preparative for the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
clearer proceedure, and that
is to ſecure the true Sence of it, in
the manner and order it is Stated and
Propoſd. And this I ſhall do, by detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and repreſenting ſome erroneous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
which muſt reflect upon the right
underſtanding of it in general.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe erroneous Opinions are theſe
<hi>three;</hi> By the firſt, we mean ſome falſe gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that are put upon the notion of Vertue,
or living Vertuouſly. By the ſecond, we
underſtand ſuch as have been offer'd by
ſome men, to make God to be altogether
unconcern'd, how men live and act, moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or immorally in this World. And the


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42467:122"/>
third ſort of ſuch Opinions are thoſe, by
which ſome men have been perſwaded,
that it is unlawful to propoſe Rewards,
as encouragements to live Vertuouſly; or
Puniſhments, to deterr men from living
Vitiouſly.</p>
               <p>Theſe be the three Opinions, that muſt
needs perplex the Stating of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in general, and therefore muſt firſt
be controul'd, before we can admit it to
a free and clear proceedure. And that
ſhall be endeavou'd in theſe three follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sections.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Section I.</head>
                  <p>IN which we ſhall firſt endeavour to free
the Argument from ſome miſtaken
notions of Vertue, or living Vertuouſly.
For if we have not a right underſtanding
of that, before we begin, it's in vain to
argue for what encouragements will be
ſufficient, to engage men ſo to live. And
then by living Vertuouſly, I here eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
though not only, underſtand Vertue
in a ſocial reſpect, that is, as to mens endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to live and act one with, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another, by the ſtrict rules of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Juſtice, as in a larger ſence it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
Univerſal Goodneſs, in all their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Parts and Branches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:42467:122"/>
Firſt, by mens living up to the rules
of Univerſal Juſtice (as it's ſtrictly to be
conſidered), I mean the allowance of
what's right and due to every man. Firſt
as to that, which is call'd Diſtributive
Juſtice, which is the juſt performance of
all relative and reciprocal Offices and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
between all Superiours, (whether
Natural or Politick) and their reſpective
Subjects and Subordinates. And then as
to that, which we call Commutative
Juſtice; I underſtand it to be mens do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what's Right and Juſt, in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of mutual Tranſactions, Contracts,
and intercurrent Affairs whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And then by Univerſal Goodneſs (as
Juſtice in a larger ſence comprehends it)
I underſtand not the acts only of doing
all men Right, but of mens doing Good
one to another (according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
capacities morally conſidered)
as there is need of one anothers mutual
help; whether it be for one anothers Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Peace, Liberty, or in any other
Circumſtances of their Well-being. And
this habit of Goodneſs, Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi>
calls <hi>The greateſt of all Vertues,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſſay. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the mind; being the Character of the
Deity; and without which (ſaith he) a man
is a Buſy, Miſchievous, and Wretched thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the man that lives according to


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42467:123"/>
the Rules of Juſtice in all theſe accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is the man that ought moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and eſpecially to be denominated
Vertuous. Not but that we ſuppoſe a
neceſſary concurrence of all the other
perſonal Vertues, as they are branch'd
out particularly in Theological, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
Schemes. But then it is to be
affirm'd of moſt, if not of all of them,
that they do one way or other eſpecially
referr to Juſtice or Goodneſs, as I have
here deſcribed them; and as that their
contrary Vices do generally receive their
eſſential notion of being Evil, becauſe in
one reſpect or other they make a breach
upon the Rules of doing Right or Good.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that it's no wonder, that the
Moraliſts have always expreſs'd that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the notion and practice of Juſtice,
(as it's in all reſpects to be conſidered)
that whether it be, becauſe it is ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the happy being of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Societies; or whether for its atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon the menage and events of moſt
other Vertuous actions, they have enobl'd
it with the moſt comprehenſive, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
name of Vertue. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls it,

And not only the
Philoſophical Moraliſm,
but even the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
it ſelf, as it referrs
to all thoſe Duties, which
it enjoins to be perform'd to God and
Man, is commonly expreſs'd by the name
of Righteouſneſs or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;<note place="margin">He that doth Juſtice (or Righteouſneſs) is Juſt (or Righteous,) 1 <hi>John 3.</hi> 7.</note>

rendred in our Tranſlations, from the

Philoſophers made uſe of.</p>
                  <p>Now, the reaſon why, in the firſt
place, I offer this term of Vertue, or
living vertuouſly, thus to conſideration,
is, becauſe there hath been too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
a very falſe notion of Religion,
or living Religiouſly: Some men placing
it only in ſome Rites and Offices, proper
to ſuch or ſuch a Religion; upon the
performance of which, they have temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one another to think themſelves, if
not wholly exempted, yet in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
fairly diſpens'd from living vertuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as I have repreſented the Notion of
Vertue. And this hath been obſerv'd,


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42467:124"/>
not only when Religions have been arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
inſtituted by Wiſe men in ſeveral
Heathen Nations, (of which ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
will be given in the following Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments)
but even then, when Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have been tendred to the World, by
the cleareſt Evidence of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>Thus did the <hi>Jews</hi> moſt groſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate
with God,<note place="margin">Eſ. 1. 13. 14, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> by their intolerable
omiſſions of living vertuouſly, that is,
by the Rules of Univerſal Juſtice and
Goodneſs,<note place="margin">Jer. 7. 4, 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> as His holy Prophets ſo often
complain. And for this did our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
in his time, ſo ſeverely reprove
thoſe ſtrict Religioniſts,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 24.</note> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Phariſees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it's obſerv'd, That the Wiſe men
of almoſt every Age of the Church,
have engaged themſelves in making ſuch
complaints of the Times they lived. in.
And I wiſh heartily, that I had not too
juſt a cauſe (which gave me the chief
occaſion of this Section) to complain
of a Religion of a later date, in which
Juſtice and Goodneſs have been ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
laid aſide, as if they bore no
part at all of the Profeſſion of it. And
the better to ſolve that intolerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to the very deſign of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
they have taught themſelves a


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42467:124"/>
moſt ſcandalous diſtinction between Grace
and Vertue; between Godlineſs and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
between Saintſhip and all Moral
Honeſty, in their notion, and (as we
have ſeen) practice of Religion, to the
great diſparagement and diſhonour of
whatſoever bears that Sacred Name.

                  <p>THis Section will repreſent another
very dangerous prejudice, as to the
manner of our ſtating the Argument.
And it's to be done by making and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
an Enquiry, whether or no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
GOD will be at all concern'd,
as to Rewards and Puniſhments, how men
live and act, whether morally or immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in this World. For if he be pleaſed
to be ſo indifferent and unconcern'd,
the Argument is void; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a Propoſal of any ſuch things, as
Rewards or Puniſhments, to encourage
and deterr, would then be the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Concern of Mind that it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
capable of.</p>
                  <p>Now, though it may be thought, that
there ſhould be but a very few, or none,


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42467:125"/>
that acknowledge a Deity, ſo deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inconſiderate of His Divine Honour,
as to own and publiſh ſuch a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to His Eſſential Holineſs, and to
that ſoveraign and wiſe Authority, which
he muſt be preſum'd to have and exerciſe
naturally over that Rational World,
which he created and made at his own
choice: For it were the ſame thing, as
to believe, That he intended to licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
men in all thoſe horrid practices
and confuſions, which ſhould ever be
acted and fall out to the World's end;
yet it's certain, that there have been,
and are opinions entertain'd, which muſt
imply ſuch an indifferency and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
in God, howſoever men live
and act. And I doubt not, but that
they have been made uſe of by many,
thereby to encourage their continuance
in their moſt immoral practices and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ways of Living.</p>
                  <p>Now, the opinions which have brought
forth that wretched effect in mens minds,
are three, to be eſpecially conſidered
and rebuked.</p>
                  <p>The firſt which I ſhall take notice of,
is that which doth directly and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
make God to be own'd as Author
and Cauſe of Sin: And then, How can
He be concern'd at all at that ſinful acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42467:125"/>
of which He himſelf ſhould be really
cauſal? Of which horrid and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
opinion,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. c. 20. cap. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>Euſebius</hi> accounts one <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi>
to be the firſt Promoter; though
<hi>Vincentius Lerinenſis</hi> makes one more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
and averrs <hi>Simon Magus</hi> as its firſt
Patron. And the Fathers did charge
that Hereſie afterward upon <hi>Cerdon, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi>
and others, as concurrent with their
ſeveral Heterodoxies.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt remarkable Reſtores in
this later Age, of that abominable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
were the late <hi>Libertines,</hi> (as the
Hiſtorians and Divines of thoſe Times
call'd them) in <hi>Germany,</hi> that thereby
they might go on with their intolerable
Profanations and deſperate Immoralities,
for their thorough-work (as they call'd it)
of a more perfect Reformation, with
greater Liberty and Encouragement.
By whoſe Example, and upon their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
we have too great a reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that out late rebellious Reformers,
tranſcrib'd too reſembling a Copy, both
in their minds and practices; and for
whoſe ſakes I have taken occaſion to
offer at this repreſentation.</p>
                  <p>The Second Opinion that muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially
inferr an indifferency and
unconcernment in God, how Men act
and live, as to the Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42467:126"/>
of another Life; is that of an
eternal and irreſpective decree of ſome
men to Salvation, with the inevitable
preterition of all the reſt of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>And that becauſe that Doctrine muſt
in conſequence ſuppoſe, not that Man,
but that GOD Himſelf ſhould be the
efficient Cauſe and principal Agent in
all the Good and Evil Actions that are
done in the World; and then, How could
the one be reaſonably rewardable, and
the other puniſhable? And firſt, as to
the Good and Vertuous Actions of them,
that are ſo abſolutely elected to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they cannot be ſuppos'd to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
their own, but God's; becauſe they
are wrought in them (as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
affirm) by ſuch an impulſe of
His Grace, as which they have not a
Liberty in themſelves to reſiſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat.</p>
                  <p>And then, as to the ſinful actions of
them that are under that fatal preteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
How can they be morally their
own, but God's, (as <hi>Cauſa deficiens in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſariis
eſt efficiens)</hi> becauſe they become
unavoidable for want of that Grace, by
which it was only poſſible for thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
men to have eſcaped and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them? And though our Opinioniſts
dare impudently pretend, That thoſe


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42467:126"/>
men have all of them a ſufficient Grace
given them, yet nevertheleſs they moſt
ſenſeleſly mean, That it is ſufficient in
it Self only, but not as unto them, ſo
as poſſibly to effect upon their beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
any advantage to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And now, How can God be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
concern'd to Reward the actions of
the one, or to Puniſh thoſe of the other;
when neither of thoſe actions were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and voluntarily their own; that is,
when neither of thoſe ſorts of men were
ever allow'd to act by a Mind that had
any truly-balanc'd Liberty of choice in
its ſelf? And therefore, in ſuch a caſe,
the propoſal of Rewards and Puniſhments
(upon which the Reaſon of the Argument
is founded) to encourage the Good or
deterr the Evil, were as impertinent, as
if a man were counſel'd to act an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
for an Eſtate, when he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in his opinion, that either he hath
had a fore-decree for an undefeizible
Title to it, or elſe of which he were
aſſur'd to be depriv'd by an inſuperable
Bar, long before put in againſt him; I
ſay, If he were ſure, that one of thoſe
two unalterable cauſes were upon him,
though he did not know which it was,
What manner of encouragement is it, that
ſhould reaſonably induce him to do any


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42467:127"/>
thing for the ſecuring or obtaining ſuch
an Eſtate? And where lays the difference
of that Caſe from this in debate, I can
make no conjecture.</p>
                  <p>The Third Opinion that neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
That God ſhould be indifferent and
unconcern'd how men live and act, as
to Rewards and Puniſhments, is from
Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> his Neceſſitation of all humane
actions, from a Chain of Cauſes link'd
together at one anothers end, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
immediate Laſt that neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
the Underſtanding ſo to judge,
and the Will ſo to chuſe. The unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Sence of which, his ſhiftleſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
can never ſolve, as when he
averrs,<note place="margin">Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</note> That <hi>though a Man can Do what
he will, yet</hi> that <hi>he cannot Will what he will:</hi>
For if the binding up the laſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Cauſes of the Action (that is
the judgment and will of Man) to a
neceſſity of judging and choice, (if it
be not Non-ſence to call it a judgment

Man leave to think, that that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
can be an effect of true Liberty;
then may the natural motion of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate,
and the operations of a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Being, which do ſpontaneouſly (yet
nevertheleſs) neceſſarily, (as neceſſity
ſtands in oppoſition to rational Liberty)


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42467:127"/>
follow that impulſe, which the <hi>Creator</hi> had
put upon their ſeveral Natures, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
call'd an act of a free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Agent. Now whoſoever hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
ſuch an opinion of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of all humane actions, muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that the firſt Link of that Chain
of Cauſes, that moves or knocks the
next to it, and ſo every next ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his next, till the laſt Cauſe drives
the Will into a neceſſity of Choice; I
ſay that firſt Link of Cauſation muſt
be ſoveraignly held in the hand of God,
as he is the firſt cauſe of all Motion,
as well as of all Being. And then it
muſt alſo be ſuppos'd, that none of
thoſe intermedial or ſecondary Cauſes,
can break from the natural order of
that train of Cauſations (without an
extraordinary intervention of the Firſt
Cauſes, Will and Power) till the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
be it good or evil, be choſen and
effected. So that if there be any cauſe
of the Action that is truly voluntary,
and by which it may be really deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
morally Good or Evil, it muſt
be the firſt only: for all the other
Cauſes are under a natural or fatal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of acting what they do, and the
Judgment and Will of Man, which
ſhould make the moral diſtinction, are


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42467:128"/>
under an impoſſibility of judging or
chuſing otherwiſe, (as Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts)
and therefore, there being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Will at liberty, by which, ſuch an
Action is to be freely choſen, if there
be any morality in the Action, it muſt
have it from the firſt Cauſe, or no where:
and then what a piece of Blaſphemy
are we fallen upon? For it makes God
not only a cauſe, but the only cauſe
of all evil and immoral Actions, as
ſuch: which a bare ſpontaneity in the
Will of Man, can no more ſolve, than
it can make a neceſſary Agent, when
it's any way inſtrumental to a miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Event, really a Criminal: ſo that
I may be angry with the Stone that
hits me, and like a Dog in rage, bite
it, as well as with the perſon that threw
it, if in both of them there were as
much neceſſity of the Action, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with a natural ſpontaneity. And
then how can GOD be concern'd in
ſuch Actions, as to Rewards and Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments,
any more, than that they
ſhould be capable of Praiſe or Blame,<note place="margin">

                  <p>THis Section is deſign'd to over-rule
the laſt prejudice, which would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
make void the ſence of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as it is ſtated. And that muſt
be done by making another enquiry,
Whether or no Almighty GOD (if it
be granted, That He will be pleaſed to
concern Himſelf; as to Rewards and
Puniſhments, how Men live and act)
intended, that men ſhould think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
oblig'd to live vertuouſly, upon
the account only of His own Sovereign
Authority, and abſolute Command, and


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42467:129"/>
that they ſhould charge themſelves with
no other motive or reaſon, but only
that? Or whether GOD deſign'd not
alſo, in that caſe, as in all others, to
deal with Mankind, as rational and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Agents; that is, that they might
propound to their own Minds, ſome
conſiderable Intereſt or Happineſs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the encouragement of which, they
ſhould oblige themſelves ſo to live and
act? And then on the other hand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they might not alſo, as reaſonably
propound to their own Thoughts, a
Conſideration of the many Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
at preſent, and their certain Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
in the event, to diſſwade and deterr
themſelves, from living immorally and
vitiouſly? Now the Reaſon, Why I
offer this caſe to enquiry, before I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
engage in the purſuit of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
is, becauſe it's known, that
there be ſome Men, (even enough to
make a party) who being reſolv'd not
to be otherwiſe perſwaded, but that a
propoſal of Rewards to encourage Men
to be Religious, and to do good, is a
moſt dangerous approach to Popery;
(the ordinary expedient, us'd by ſuch
men to affright Minds, where Reaſons
are wanting) and that it can import
nothing leſs, than the Romiſh Merit,
and I know not what.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:42467:129"/>
And then on the other ſide, (ſay they)
for men to ſuggeſt to themſelves, the
dread of Future Puniſhments, (though
for that reaſon they are propos'd as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Chriſtian Faith) is nothing
elſe but ſlaviſh Fear, (by which they
falſely repreſent that religious Act of
mind) and that to avoid ſinning on
that account, can no way be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but rather diſtaſtful to Almighty
GOD.</p>
                  <p>But theſe mens prejudices in this point,
have yet further ends and little notions
to ſerve. For (ſay they) ſuch a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
of Rewards and Puniſhments, do tempt
men to give too much to the Creature;
it hinders the Advancement of free Grace,
and takes men off from bottoming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon Chriſt, (as they phraſe it)
and from rowling themſelves by Faith,
inconditionately upon his Merits; with
many more ſuch like humouring Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuch unhappy impoſures as theſe,
have vulgar minds admitted, to the vaſt
prejudice of Vertue, and an active Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and all this becauſe they would
fain go to Heaven, without any incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
moralities, ſuch as are the Vertues
and Graces of ſtrict Juſtice, Reſtitution
and Satisfaction upon the Breach of it;


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42467:130"/>
intire Loyalty to their Princes, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to their Superiours of every kind;
Charity to their Enemies, and doing Good
to all Men as much as in them lay, and
the like; And that inſtead of them, they

of an imaginary Faith, or a deluſive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,

put them upon ſo much trouble and

men would but conſider, how much
ſuch triflings with God and their own

and how foreign ſuch Notions are
to the expreſs purpoſe and end of the

how many ſubterfuges are to be

it's very probable (where there be no

great part of that demonſtration, which
they can make for His Exiſtence, muſt
ariſe from an opinion of His being their
firſt Maker, and conſtant Benefactor.
And if they ſhall ſo repreſent the Deity to
their Minds, they may as eaſily ſuggeſt
to themſelves, that he could not but
indefinitely deſign them to be happy,
when at firſt he made them; or that
otherwiſe, he would never have given

would ſoon ſatisfy themſelves, That

What Arguments can they offer
themſelves to the contrary, but that
they may as lawfully chuſe to imitate
the ſame freedom, which by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

                  <p>And in this Exception it may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuggeſted, That when there is at

thoughts and apprehenſions,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. De Vit. Philoſ.</note> who may

That the ſame Juſt Deity would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

that ſhall obſerve thoſe Rules; and will

                  <p>In anſwering this Exception, I ſhall
contract my Reply to this latter period
of it, where there only doth appear
whatſoever is cogent in it. And then,
I ſay, That whereas it's ſuggeſted, that
thoſe Philoſophers might influence ſuch
mens minds into a Belief, that God will
be favourable to Good men, and puniſh
Offenders; if they mean (as they muſt,
except they own a future State) that the

                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:42467:134"/>
For if that Deity ſhould not conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
keep up his favourable Providence to
the Vertuous, ſo as alwaies to anſwer
their reaſonable hopes and expectations:
or if he ſhould not as conſtantly rebuke
and puniſh the Offenders, ſo as to ſecure
their conſtant Fear of Him; Men would
not be affected with the uncertain hopes
of the one, nor dread of the other, ſo as
to decline any advantageous, though the
moſt unjuſt Adventure, for their preſent
eaſe, profit, or pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And that God Almighty doth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
the exact Executions of His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to the Vertuous, and of His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
to the Vitious in this Life, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
experience doth ſufficiently evince:
And it hath been the buſineſs of the
Firſt Argument, to demonſtrate the Truth
of it.</p>
                  <p>But now, ſuppoſe, that it were certain
to all, as it falls out ſometimes to ſome,
that that Deity would infallibly do that
work in this world, according to the
merits and demerits of the one and the
other; yet would the Criminals eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
thoſe fears, by conſidering, that
either the Divine Juſtice would ſtrike
them with an immediate death, and (as it
is the ſence of a Theiſt) throw them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42467:135"/>
would judge for themſelves, that ſuch a
a ſtate of being nothing (if I may be

more preferrable, than to live miſerably

                  <p>THis Third Section tenders us the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of them that will alledge.
That God Almighty hath delegated the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions
of his Providence, in this Caſe, to
humane Powers and Authorities, to make
Laws &amp; Edicts which may keep the World
in order, and that the accountableneſs of
mens lives and actions to their Cognizance
and Umpire, for the rewarding the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
and puniſhing the Immoral, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to oblige all men to act well and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly,
is all that the Great Creatour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd

ſo that there is no need of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

                  <p>To this exception I anſwer, That it
could not be the purpoſe of our Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
God, in his ordering the worlds Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the manner and method it's
conſtituted, that Mankind might univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
(for it muſt be ſo, if there be any
Sence in the Allegation) offer themſelves
ſufficient reaſons and encouragements


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42467:136"/>
(as to rewards and puniſhments) to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
themſelves to be Good and Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or reſtrain them from being immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
on that account, without a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

eſpecial Grounds and Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe, where there be the beſt
Laws and Conſtitutions that ever were
made and eſtabliſhed, it muſt ſuppoſe all
Supreme Powers and Governours to have
a ſufficient Proſpect of the merits and
demerits of every individual Perſon and
Action, as they are to be balanc'd by
the meaſures of all their various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:
And then to be alwaies intent,
curious, and conſtant in the performance
of their rewarding and puniſhing Offices,
for the Intereſts of every ſuch ſingle
Cauſe and Perſon, as well as in Matters
of general and publick import: And
again, in this Caſe, it muſt be further
ſuppos'd, That all the ſubſtituted Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators
of their Princes Laws and good
Intentions, (the Work being impoſſible
to be alwaies done in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)
muſt alſo be as knowing and
faithful in their due ſubadminiſtrations:
I ſay, If it were poſſible to be preſum'd,
that all Governments and their Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
were deſign'd of God to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
thus qualify'd and diſpoſed, there


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42467:136"/>
might be a tolerable Plea and Pretence
to believe, that he intended no better,
or no other reaſons to oblige men to be
Good and Vertuous, and to reſtrain them
from being Evil: But if common, and
ſometimes woeful Experience, can prove
the contrary; and if the Maxims of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which the grand Politician
<hi>Machiavil</hi> have offer'd
the World,<note place="margin">Collected by a Learned <hi>Italian,</hi> and Tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Engliſh by <hi>J. B.</hi>
                     </note> be juſtifiably
repreſented, the doubt
and uncertainty is too
great for a Good man to depend upon
ſuch adminiſtrations for his reward, and
the former Suppoſals too unlikely to be
True, ſo as to reſtrain an Evil man, that
is either bold or cunning, from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſteſt
intendments and undertakings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The next reaſon to evince,
That it could not be God's Purpoſe, that
all mens accountableneſs to Governours,
ſhould be their ſufficient Reaſon to live
vertuous Lives, or to deterr them from
living otherwiſe, is, becauſe their Laws,
how well and wiſely ſoever conſtituted
and adminiſtred, are experimentally found
to be alwaies ſo avoidable, by ſome mens
Greatneſs, by other mens Cunning, and
by moſt mens favourable Conſtructions,
that it too often comes to paſs, that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
perſons have been ſo far from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42467:137"/>
a Reward for doing well, that
they have hardly acquitted themſelves
by the benefit of the Laws, for their
own ordinary Rights and Safety. And
that on the other hand; unjuſt men have
been ſo far from being ſo ſufficiently
terrify'd, as to reſtrain them from doing
Evil, that they have oftentimes been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
encourag'd to adventure upon the
worſt of actions, by an Obſervation, that
it is but a ſmall number, whom the Law
rebukes and puniſheth, in compariſon of
the multitudes of Delinquents that daily
eſcape.</p>
                  <p>It's more than probable (they'll ſay)
that there is never a man beheaded for
Treaſon, or arraign'd for leſſer Crimes,
but that there be hundreds in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
who have deſerved as much or
more, yet of whoſe actions the Laws or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
proceedure hath taken no hold
at all. And if from the great Eſtates
that have been raiſed by frauds and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
(where the Laws have ſilently
paſs'd them by) the men that advanc'd
them and their Heirs, were inforc'd to
refund to the ſatisfaction of the injur'd,
many great men muſt deſcend into a
parell equipage with their honeſt Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of a meaner quality. And if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
delinquent ſhould come into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42467:137"/>
in a White Sheet, that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
it as much as they that do, the
Congregation in ſome places would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
come to too near a reſemblance of a
Collegiate Aſſemblies Complexion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe be the Two Reaſons, by which
is evidenc'd the deficiency of all humane
Governments and Laws for the ends pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                  <p>But now comes my Sceptick, and he
offers a reaſonable Enquiry to know,
that if this be not, what then is the
end, which Governments do obtain, ſo
as to anſwer Gods Wiſe Intendment in
their Conſtitutions?</p>
                  <p>My Anſwer to his Enquiry is, That it
is without all doubt, that God Almighty
obliged all Authorities, upon their Duty
to him, and in his place, faithfully to
endeavour the juſtification and protection
of the Good and Vertuous, and for the
puniſhment of evil doers (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth);<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note>
but becauſe all thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that are ſo entruſted to act that
good to Mankind in their ſeveral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative
Capacities, are free Agents,
Created with Faculties indifferently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to Good and Evil, and are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(as all other men are) ſet in a
probationary State for another World,
&amp; ſo are at choice, whether or no they will


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42467:138"/>
prepare themſelves for a future Reward or
Puniſhment, by their performing or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their reſpective governing Offices;
therefore, as it could not but be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency,
whether they would be ſo juſt
and careful, ſo it could not but be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
intendment in God, when he
firſt deſign'd their conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>But more cloſely to ſolve the doubt,
I conceive that the abſolute end, which
God deſign'd that his deputed Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
muſt certainly attain, and without
which attainment they muſt of courſe
ceaſe to be, what they are, is, That the
Nations and Communities under their
reſpective charges, might be kept in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
or national ſubſiſtences, whatſoever
the miſcarriages of their Governments o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
ſhould be in all other reſpects.
That is, when Princes are careful ſo to
keep up their Authorities, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may not by their Seditions bring
themſelves at pleaſure into an Anarchical
and tumultuary State; which ought to
be accounted the moſt fatal misfortune to
Mankind, and of all evil, humane contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
in this world, the greateſt.</p>
                  <p>So that the wiſdom and Goodneſs of
God in conſtituting and upholding Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
is not then only to be own'd
and acknowledg'd, when every ſingle


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42467:138"/>
vertuous perſon, and juſt cauſe, is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rewarded and vindicated; nor when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
unjuſt man is as fully Rebuked and
Puniſhed (a work not to be expected to
be compleatly done, while defectible
Mortals are engaged in that management
of it) but Gods mercy is then to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd,
when the Peoples ſafety
is ſo far provided for, that evil and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men (though they may ſometimes
diſturb, yet) cannot at will overturn the
Eſtabliſhed Governments under which
they live, and are protected. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is on all hands adjudg'd, that the
worſt Tyrannies, and the moſt oppreſſive
Governments, are incomparably to be
preferr'd to no Government at all; that
is, when all men are left at liberty to
act how and what they pleaſe: and ſo
become (as certainly they will) their
own greateſt Tyrants and Oppreſſors;
and without any controul from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expedient, but that which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
hath appointed for their ſafety and
deliverance: and that is, Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and their ſubmiſſion to it.</p>
                  <p>And if theſe ſolutions can't ſatisfy our
Cavillers enquiry, when he offers any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that ſhall appear more ſufficient to
an unprejudic'd underſtanding to ſolve
this obſervation, in which the Creators


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42467:139"/>
honour it's ſo much concern'd, I ſhall then
renounce the uſe I make of them, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
for another world's Exiſtence.
And this ſolves the Third Exception.</p>

                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:42467:139"/>
1. Firſt I take notice, That that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
(or Saying rather) That <hi>Vertue is
her own Reward,</hi> was originally put into
reputation, as by the <hi>Stoicks</hi> principally,
ſo alſo by ſome other Philoſophers, on
purpoſe to uphold the Belief of the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Man's attainment of a ſufficient
Happineſs in this preſent Life, to avoid
the neceſſary Belief of placing it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World. For thoſe Wiſe men having
tumbled about their Thoughts where to
fix that ſufficient Good and Happineſs,
and finding that thoſe, who had plac'd
it upon any preſent Enjoyments for a
proſperous and ſenſual way of living,
could not poſſibly ſtand their ground,
againſt thoſe pregnant Reaſons, that
every man's Experience could dictate to
the contrary: So thoſe Wiſe men were
at laſt neceſſitated to pitch upon this
Expedient of making <hi>Vertue her own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
as being ſubject to the leaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
Though in the ſence and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
how it ſhould effect that Reward,
the Philoſophers were no more likely
to agree, than thoſe men, who deſign'd
to place mens Chiefeſt Happineſs in any
other thing, whoſe enjoyment was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable
in this preſent World. Of
which the Reader will find a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in the laſt Argument, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42467:140"/>
And this Philoſophical Principle hath
ſince been kept up by the Predeſtinarian
Divines, as better conſiſtent with their
notion of irreſpective Election, of which
I have given ſome account in the <hi>Firſt
Chapter, Sect.</hi> 2. And from that kind
of Divinity, I verily believe, that notion
hath been inconſiderately and unwarily
entertain'd even to this day, by Divines
and others, of a better Mind and ſoberer
Judgment.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, I anſwer, That as that
Opinion or Saying had thoſe unhappy
Intereſts to ſerve in its Firſt Riſe and
Proceſs, ſo, upon a more ſtrict Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
it cannot in it ſelf be True. And,
firſt, as to the nature and proper notion
of a Reward; which cannot but be of
ſomething that is kindly as well as
equitably beſtow'd, by any Perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to give or allow it to another:
For no man can be properly ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
himſelf; he cannot in any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sence be the Giver, Receiver, and
Judge of the Equity of the ſame thing;
which muſt be True in a ſtrict Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Speaking, if Vertue may be ſaid to
be properly her (that is, the vertuous
man's) own Reward.</p>
                  <p>Then, Secondly, If it be alledg'd, That
Reward in that Saying ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42467:140"/>
in a Metaphorical Sence; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then can the notion hold good in
that acceptation, to the purpoſe, for
which that Saying was to be made uſe
of. For to be metaphorically accepted,
is as much as to ſay, That <hi>Vertue is
her own Reward,</hi> becauſe it becomes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is like, or reſembles a Reward:
but then it muſt be ſuch a ſomething,
that muſt be ſuppos'd (if they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Mind to be the proper Seat of
a Rational Beings happineſs) to depend
upon the vertuous man's opinion and
imagination; that is, That he is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
rewarded and happy, if he can
think himſelf ſo, and ſo long as his
Mind is in temper to imagine himſelf to
be ſo. But then, if a man would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how inſecure any ſuch vertuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
muſt needs be of keeping his mind
in that good humour, upon ſeveral
accounts, he would ſoon find cauſe to
bluſh at the pretence of believing Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to be her own Reward, upon his
Thinking act of its ſelf-ſufficiency. For
Who knows not, but that ſometimes his
Minds kind temper (without any reaſon
to be given for it) may alter by his
imaginative Faculties natural diſpoſition
to change and variation: ſometimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the preſent temper of the


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42467:141"/>
Body, (as in Hypocondriack Perſons
eſpecially) ſometimes by the Minds ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
at all times, to ſubdue the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of its unruly Affections, and lower
Appetites; and very often by a vertuous
man's obſervation of his own many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and imperfections in his beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments
and performances? I ſay, when
theſe various caſes happen, What's then
become of that Reward, or that which
is Tropically like it? Can it give the
Mind a Beatitude, without its own allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
or conſent? Or, Can the Mind
have ſatisfaction, and be unſatisfy'd at the
ſame time? In ſhort, Can that be a
man's ſufficient Happineſs, of whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
he cannot be one hour ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the weakneſs of the
pretence of making Vertue her own
ſufficient Reward, without any other
expectation, may yet be further diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:
It's obſerved, that the greateſt
Contenders for that ſaying, do ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
demonſtrate its defect, by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a concurrence of almoſt all parts
of humane proſperity, as neceſſary to
ſupport that, which they call Vertues
Reward.</p>
                  <p>And to make this good, I ſhall here
only offer the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> (who,


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42467:141"/>
as induſtriouſly as poſſible, had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to have Mans ſelf-ſufficient Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
plac'd in Vertues being her own
Reward) and he tells us, that there be
unfortunate caſes that concern Honour,
Children, Beauty, and the like; which
by no means can allow the vertuous
Man to be a happy Perſon. And then
(ſaith he in the ſame place) how can he
be happy that's deform'd,<note place="margin">—<gap reason="foreign">

of the neceſſary confluence of ſo
many conveniences of living well and
eaſily in the world, do not ſhew the
unſufficiency of ſuch a pretended ſelf-Reward,
we muſt diſclaim every conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
that's moſt rationally inferr'd.
Hence it is, That the Ingenious<note n="*" place="margin">

had ſo ſlender an Opinion of Vertues
being her own Reward, that he even
derides the Humour of that preſence,
and tells us, that it would but teach
Men to repent, that ever they had been


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42467:142"/>
Vertuous at all, if they got no more
by it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, I anſwer and
grant, (to ſave our Pretenders Credit)
That it is with that ſaying of <hi>Vertues
being her own Reward,</hi> as it is with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other general Axioms, and common
Proverbial Speeches, that are grounded
upon ſome certain Truth, which yet in
other reſpects, may admit ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions
and Exceptions, and with
which, thoſe very Axioms may be ſo
over-balanc'd, that there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as good ones taken from ſome of
their very limitations.</p>
                  <p>And there may be ſome Axioms ſo
equally balanc'd between true and falſe,
that it were indifferent, if they were
given either negatively or affirmatively.
Upon this conſideration, I do allow ſome
Truth in the common ſaying, That
<hi>Vertue is her own Reward,</hi> that is, the
mind may ſometimes by living vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
receive ſome general ſatisfaction
to its ſelf, and that ſome Vertues may
ſometimes convenience a Mans credit,
health, peace, and the like: but then
on the other ſide, when it's conſidered,
that there is no ſuch abſolute certainty
in attaining thoſe conveniences, as to
make up an entire and ſelf-ſufficient


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42467:142"/>
Happineſs, without any reference at all
to the grand Rewards of another Life:
I ſay, when all thoſe Reſtrictions are
put into the balance, I dare as poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm, that <hi>Vertue is not her own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
as to ſay it is. Nay, I muſt ſay
it's impoſſible it ſhould be ſo affirm'd,
if any man (as the Philoſophers did)
ſhall go about to confront the Beatitude
of another World, by giving it Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives,

offered in diſproof of that Saying, as it
bears a deſign to exclude (though but
in notion) any other kind of Happineſs
to ſtand in competition with it, I cannot
but wonder, that any man of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Name, ſhould go about a defence
of it; or that any Divini ſhould dare
to affirm (as it hath been uſually done)


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42467:143"/>
in publick, That if there were neither
Heaven nor Hell, it were encouragement
enough to live a religious and vertuous
Life, becauſe <hi>Vertue was her own Reward.</hi>
What could be ſaid more to the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the Sacred Inſtitution of
the Goſpel, whoſe main deſign is to
tender the Rewards of another World, as
the moſt reaſonable and prevailing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement,
to engage men to live good
and vertuous Lives? Of which ſurely
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſufficiently ſenſible, when
he avow'd, That had they Hope only
in this Life, they were of all men moſt
miſerable.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 19.</note> He had forgot, that <hi>Vertue
was her own</hi> ſelf-ſufficient <hi>Reward,</hi> and
that by which they might all have been
perfectly Happy, notwithſtanding their
want of any ſuch Hope.</p>
                  <p>And thus my Argument hath eſcaped

                  <p>Now; in reſpect of the obſcurer way
of God's allowing the <hi>Jews</hi> the notices


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42467:144"/>
of another World's Rewards, (as for

<hi>A ſhadow of good things to come;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> that is,
though the clear revelation of a future
ſtate was reſpitted to the Evangelical
Diſpenſation, yet the <hi>Jews</hi> might, in that
darker manner, have as much certainty
of its Exiſtence, as a ſhadow can evince,
That the Sun is in Being, though its own
body of Light were then not directly
look'd upon; or, as when in a gloomy
day the Sun is mantled with a Cloud,
yet it may be apprehended as certainly,
That the Sun is in the Horizon, and that
it is Day, as if there were never an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſure
in the Firmament: The Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a Face, though drawn with a
Cole, can aſſure one, that it repreſents
ſuch a Perſon, though it wants the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
beauty, which the finiſhing

                  <p>And had there not been ſuch a known
Certainty, though in ſuch ſhady repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations,
of another World's Rewards
and Bleſſings, to the Ages preceeding the
<hi>Meſſiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> How could St. <hi>Paul</hi> averr of
the ancient Saints of God, of whom he
makes ſuch a large Catalogue, That what
they did and ſuffer'd for GOD and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
was upon the encouragement of


<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42467:144"/>
hoping for a better Country than <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan?</hi>
or, that he ſhould ſay of <hi>Moſes</hi>
himſelf, That when he renounc'd the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Glories, and the preſent Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Sin, he was encourag'd to it,
by <hi>having his Eye upon the Recompence
of Reward?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the manner of God's giving
them the Underſtanding of a future
World, was but accommodated to all other
the parts of their whole Diſpenſation.
Particularly to inſtance in the Caſe of
their ſolemn Expiations, by the Blood
of thoſe Animals, which were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for that Service: Now, as it was
impoſſible for the <hi>Jews</hi> to believe ſo
groſly,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 4.</note> as if the Blood of Bulls and Goats
(as the Apoſtle argues) ſhould take away
Sins: but that there was ſomething more
to come, of which that Blood was Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
ſo the ſame Thoughts we muſt have
of them, as to a future ſtate: It was
not poſſible that ſuch Perſons could
think, that all the Bleſſings which God
deſign'd to His obedient and faithful
Servants, ſhould look no further than the
Advantages of Temporal Bleſſings, (of
which it's queſtionable, whether God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
continued to them ſo vaſtly a
greater ſhare than he did to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
which they could not but ſee, to


<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42467:145"/>
be generally and promiſcuouſly diſpos'd
both to the Good and Evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I anſwer, That though God
gave them no expreſs Revelation for
the Exiſtence of the other World, yet
they had the common Benefit which God
allow'd to Mankind in general; That is,
to be able to demonſtrate the Exiſtence
of that ſtate to themſelves and others, by
Rational Evidence; by which they, as
well as the Heathen World, might be
encourag'd to live vertuous Lives, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the common meaſures of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Religion, of which the ſubſtantial
part of the <hi>Jews</hi> Diſpenſation did eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>And GOD might be pleas'd, in His
ſovereign Wiſdom, to admit the <hi>Jews</hi> to
no expreſs revealed way of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the certain Exiſtence of that future
ſtate, but by ſuch an Expedient, of which
the Heathen World might be capable, as
well as themſelves: That is, that the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> might be the more reaſonably
invited to it, and the more readily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the Jewiſh Religion, when they
ſaw, that the principal Fundamental of
it did ſtand upon ſo firm a bottom as
Rational Demonſtration. And the reaſon
of that might be, becauſe the Jewiſh Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
had no ſuch conſiderable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations


<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42467:145"/>
to confirm its credibility, as
the Goſpels had; nor were all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of it in themſelves ſo univerſally
conſonant to right Reaſon, nor ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
of natural Religion, as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
was; ſo that to adventure the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of a future ſtate upon a bare Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of Revelation only, might then have
put thoſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> Minds into a Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
That that part of the <hi>Revelation</hi> had
had no better Foundation in Reaſon, than
many other parts of the ſame Reveal'd
Religion had. Now, it was otherwiſe
with the Evangelick Diſpenſation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all the principal practick parts of
its Profeſſion were ſo Rational, and ſo
agreeable to natural Religion, that had
not the Article of a future World, and
all that relates to it, been offer'd to
Faith, and not left to Demonſtration, (as
the <hi>Jews</hi> in a great part might have it)
the whole Chriſtian Religion would have
ſeem'd to a Heathen Mind, and perhaps ſo
to ſome others, rather to be of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
than of Divine Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I anſwer, That it is very
probable, that ſuch a Rational way of
demonſtrating another World, might be
alſo ſomewhat encourag'd by Tradition
from the Patriarchal ſtate of the Church,
from which the <hi>Jews</hi> had many things


<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42467:146"/>
in great veneration, and conſtant practice.</p>
                  <p>But howſoever, that knowledge of the
other World reach'd their Minds, it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the belief of it was a Doctrine
ſo catholick among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the
<hi>Sadducees</hi> (whoſe Sect began about the
time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that is,
about three Centuries before Chriſt came)
were accounted amongſt them as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
for denying the Exiſtence of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
the Reſurrection of the Dead, and
of another World. Afterward, in the
early Age of <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Trypho</hi> the
<hi>Jew,</hi> in his Dialognizing, acknowledgeth,
That pious Souls, after
their departures from
the Bodies,<note place="margin">—<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Dial. cum Tryph. pag. 223.</note> ſhall exiſt in
a better place; and, that
the unjuſt and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhall be in a worſe
ſtate, expecting the time
of their Judgment. And the Author of
<hi>Europae Speculum,</hi> accounting the preſent
ſtate of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Europ. Spec. Pag. 223.</note> informs us, That the
Belief of the end of the World, and of
the final Judgment; of the reſtoring of
Mens Bodies, and of their everlaſting
Happineſs in the heighth of the Heavens,
is Good in general. And by theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
our Sceptick, I hope, will place no
confidence in this Laſt Exception.</p>

               <p>WHerein (as the proceedure of
the Argument doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
require it) I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to repreſent poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
That there can be no other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Motives or Encouragements; or
(which is the ſame) no other ſufficient
Reaſons morally to oblige a man, that is,
(as he acts rationally) really to enable
him to live a vertuous Life, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
himſelf from being vitious and
immoral, but ſuch as bear a relation to
a Future World. And to make this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
convictively true, I ſhall reduce
all I have to ſay about it, to one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Head, which, with what relates
to it, muſt neceſſarily occaſion two
diſtinct Sections. In the Firſt, I ſhall
offer Reaſons for it from the mighty Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
with which a man muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
when he is about the work of
living a Vertuous Life. In the Second,
I muſt Anſwer two Exceptions againſt
what thoſe Reaſons import, concerning
the difficulties of being Vertuous and
Good; and I ſhall alſo give Reaſons,
why GOD was pleas'd that the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42467:147"/>
of being ſo, ſhould be ſo incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd.</p>

                  <head>Section I.</head>
                  <p>IN this Firſt Section, I ſhall purſue
that order; that is, It ſhall endeavour
to demonſtrate, That no other Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
or Reaſons (for in the caſe
of rational Agents, they are both the
ſame) can morally be ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
a Man's reſolution and practice
to live a Good and Vertuous Life, but
ſuch as relate to a Future World. And
the Repreſentation of it, will be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the conſideration of the very
many, and otherwiſe, uncontroulable
oppoſitions, difficulties, and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with which GOD thought fit,
in His Divine Wiſdom, That the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Mans being Vertuous and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
ſhould be ſo encumber'd, That
no leſs Reaſons or Encouragements ſhould
be thought ſufficient to balance his
mind reſolutely to grapple with them,
but ſuch as concern another World.
And all this I ſhall endeavour to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
by giving the Reader a full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of thoſe Encumbrances, under
theſe Five Heads.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:42467:147"/>
But before I can well begin to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
thoſe ſeveral caſes, I muſt firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to obviate one great Exception;
and it's offer'd by them, that will be
ready to ſay, That there be ſome natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
diſpoſitions to Vertue in many, if
not in moſt Men, more or leſs, that
may even of courſe, make the way of
Vertue more eaſy and leſs incumber'd,
without any neceſſary conſideration had
to the encouraging and obliging Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of anotehr World. Now our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptioner
means, ſome Mens natural
Modeſty, and good-Nature; other Mens
placable, peaceable, honourable and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Inclinations; and then, that ſuch
natural Tempers may in themſelves fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
a Vertuous Life.</p>
                  <p>My Anſwer to this Exception, will
be managed upon ſeveral Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as to ſuch Vertuous Actions,
as derive from thoſe Mens natural good
Tempers, as they come up to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of neceſſity in acting them, and
may reſemble the Vertues of ſome Brute
Animals, that act by inſtinct, ſo they
may oft-times, be rather material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than truly, formally Vertuous. And
therefore, Divines ought to advertize
ſuch kinds of Perſons, not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confident


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42467:148"/>
of their being really Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
(eſpecially upon a Religious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count)
from Actions, that perhaps,
may be no more than the natural Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of their complexional diſpoſitions
to ſome particular Vertues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſuggeſt, That Men of thoſe
naturally good Qualifications, though
in the beginning of their converſe in
the World, may readily act ſuch Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
as relate to their complexions, yet
when they come afterward to meet
ſtrong Temptations to the contrary,
may find the ſame difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
to preſerve their natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good Temper, as others of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
humour. What prodigies of a loſt
Modeſty, of a baffl'd good Nature, and
of a debauch'd Honour, have ſome men
appear'd to be, that had the natural
advantage of thoſe Excellent Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I offer to conſideration, That
ſuch Men, as are naturally endow'd
with any of thoſe complexional diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
to Vertue, may yet be obſerv'd,
to have in their Tempers, ſome other
Humours and Inclinations, which may
create as great a difficulty to preſerve
their vertuous Converſations intire, as
thoſe Men meet withal, who have the


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42467:148"/>
taſk of contending with the want of
ſuch naturally good diſpoſitions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and Laſtly, As to that more
famous natural qualification of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
temper, upon which principle
In grant, that many excellently Vertuous
things have been, and are acted in the
World; but then I ſay, how eaſily is
the Notion of true Honour loſt, and
what miſtaken meaſures and diſguiſes of
it are too generally entertain'd in the
world; ſo that, though ſuch perſons may
ſhew a greatneſs of mind in ſome caſes,
yet if they have no Religious Principles
in them to give them a beter conduct
of their actions, how will their natural
and complexional honour extravagate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch wild exceſſes, as are altogether
unaccountable to any ſence of Reaſon,
or Vertue? how will ſome ſuch men
maintain their hardy reſolutions, and
natural ſtoutneſs in a Duel, perhaps on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for an offenſive word, that would not
ſo honourably expreſs it in all thoſe acts
of ſtrict juſtice and goodneſs, as I have
repreſented the notion of vertue, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vertuouſly, in the Firſt Chapter of
this Argument, Sect. the Firſt?</p>
                  <p>And now having acquitted my ſelf of
this exception, I ſhall preſume upon the
force of my Arguing, That the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42467:149"/>
and incumbrances of being truly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
are ſuch, that no encouragements
can be ſufficient to oppoſe and controul
them, but ſuch as may be propos'd from
the concern of a Future World.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let a man attentively conſider in
his mind, the true Figure of his whole
compounded ſelf; that is, how he is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
made up of two greatly diverſe, and
in many reſpects, very incongruous parts
and principles, <hi>viz.</hi> a Body and a Soul;
each of which ſuppos'd to be naturally
qualify'd with ſo many different capacities
of acting, and which require ſuch varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of objects, about which, to exerciſe
their operations. And then how thoſe
operations do bear a tendency to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diſagreeing ends and purpoſes, that
a mans whole Nature ſeems to be a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellany
of Beings, or a complication of
many natures in One.</p>
                  <p>And then let him further conſider, that
moſt of thoſe Parts and Powers of his
thus compounded ſelf, ſuch as be his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative
faculty, the affections and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Soul, and the various appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
of the Corporeal and Senſual part of
his Being, are not only diſpos'd to exert
their ſeveral operations in a great diſpari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to, and with one another, but moſt
commonly in direct contrariety to his
reaſoning mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:42467:149"/>
Now here lays the mighty difficulty of
being Good and Vertuous, becauſe it's
a very hard thing to bring all thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts of humane Nature, which are
ſo variouſly multiply'd both in Soul and
Body, and are ſo inconſiſtent one with
another, to the Rule, Conduct, and
Dominion of right Reaſon; inſomuch,
that for the gaining that power, no man
can acquit his endeavour, without a kind
of Tyranny upon a very great part of
himſelf: Of which <hi>Porphyry</hi> (though a
Heathen) could not but be ſo ſenſible,
that ſpeaking of the purgation (which
you may alſo frequently have notice of,
in other Philoſophers) of a mans ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Appetites in order to Vertue, diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that it can't be done
without the Souls divorce
from the Body,<note place="margin">

and that in the hardeſt inſtance of
its employment without a Crucifixion
of himſelf in his affections and luſts.</p>
                  <p>Now, if a man had been all Soul, and
that Soul all Underſtanding, it would
have been thought no hard matter to
be Vertuous and Good, and that becauſe
his underſtanding power would not have


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42467:150"/>
allow'd any thing to be undertaken and
acted, that is contrary to its ſelf: But
when it's conſidered, that there be beſides
that faculty in humane nature, ſo many
principles of action both in Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that hold ſuch a ſtrong oppoſition to
his reaſoning Power, and will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly

the intereſt of vertue, that man muſt be
very credulous or unconcern'd, that can

ſufficient to engage him to enter the liſts
of that war with himſelf, and to uphold
his mind againſt ſuch powerful contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions

appear to him far greater and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
than any of thoſe ſatisfactions,
which the inferiour parts of his Nature
exact and call for. And if it were not
ſo, this abſurdity muſt follow, That his
Reaſon muſt be ſuppos'd to be left to act
without a reaſon; that is, without a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
encouragement from ſome end or
other, whoſe value and preference might
over-rule and controul all other intereſts
whatſoever, that are in themſelves found
to be leſs eſteemable. Now I deſire that
any man would ſuggeſt to me, what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs


<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42467:150"/>
there is attainable in his Mortal
life, which he may propoſe to himſelf
to be ſo conſiderable, as may ingage his
ſuperiour mind to oppoſe the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his imagination and paſſions of his
Soul, and the ſenſual appetites of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Self, in order to Vertue. And if
he can't find any thing in this world,
that may affect his mind with ſuch a
value (as I have in other Arguments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd,
that there is nothing) then either
he muſt fly to ſomething that is beyond
this preſent mortal State, or elſe it muſt
be preſum'd that God Almighty hath
afforded him no ſufficient encouragement
to be good and vertuous at all. The
ſumm is, That God hath deſignedly (as
I ſhall repreſent in the next Section) made
man in ſuch a figure, and gave him ſuch
a kind of nature, that nothing can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
encourage him to be Religious,
Good, and Vertuous, but only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of another World.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> as a mans intendments for
vertue may be thus perplexed with a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous
company of his inferiour Paſſions,
and ſenſual Appetites within him, ſo let
him conſider, what a kind of world it is,
in which he is by Divine Ordination,
ſocially to enjoy his Being; and then,
how much therein all vertuous intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons


<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42467:151"/>
will be conſtantly encumber'd with
ſo many differently flattering objects,
that are not only foreign, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
contrary to the exerciſes of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
without him. Which kind of objects
whereſoever he lives, with whomſoever
he converſeth, or in whatſoever quality
of life he is employ'd; will always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his ſenſes and imagination, and be
ſoliciting his affections and ſenſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
for entertainment. And if ever
thoſe bewitching enchantments for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſeeming ſatisfaction, do but gain a
preference in his fancy (which will be
a hard matter for him to eſcape) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that ſhall but once come to intereſt his
Affections, it's beyond a peradventure,
but that the Supreme Part of his Soul,
though it ſhould then ſtand on the ſide
or part of Vertue, would ſoon be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in the conteſt; and grow weak and
imprevalent, if it hath not greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
to enable it to undergo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
with thoſe competitours, than ſuch
as he can poſſibly ſuggeſt to himſelf, from
any the beſt concerns of this preſent
life.</p>
                  <p>And then, when by the treachery of
his Debauch'd fancy and affections, the
Rational part of his Soul ſhall ſtoop to
admit an impoſure upon its ſelf, ſo as to


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42467:151"/>
approve and conſent to what the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
parts of himſelf have ſo ſuggeſted;
it's more than probable, but that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of vertues will immediately, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
become nauſeous to him in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but will be repreſented to his mind
under ſome reproachful characters of
diſparagement. That is, perhaps his
mind will be over-rul'd, to think Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
too unpleaſant and unſociable,
Fortitude too dangerous, Prudence too
formal, Gratitude and Ingenuity the ſilly
effects of an eaſy Nature, Juſtice and
Honeſty too nice and unthrifty; and all
other kinds of Vertues too unaccommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
for his preſent Intereſt, Pride, or
Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And if the Rational Judgment be once
thus diſorder'd and prejudic'd, what can
reſtore him to the true eſtimation and
love of what is Good and Vertuous, in
order to a Manly reſiſtence of all thoſe
powerful Temptations, that will be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gazing upon him, to perſwade him
to the contrary? Surely there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe can come in balance with
thoſe potent Enemies to Vertue, ſo as
to over-rule his mind to reſiſt them, but
a lively and a prevailing concern, for
what relates to a Future World. It muſt
be ſuch an apprehenſion or none, That.


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42467:152"/>
can enable him to make an impartial
Judgment of the neceſſity of being
Good, or that can advance a ſufficient
rational Power in him to conquer his
abus'd Imaginations and Affections;
which will otherwiſe, in deſpite of all
other Arguments that can be given him
to the contrary, every day more and
more endanger his mind, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably
affixed to the preſent World's
deluſive, and vainly admir'd Shows, and
Fooleries.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The difficulty of deſigning
and living a Vertuous Life, is yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
encreaſed, when it's conſidered,
That ſo great a part of Humane Life is
paſt and gone, before a Man is grown
old enough to be himſelf; that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his ſuperiour mind will think it ſelf
at leiſure, or indeed, be ordinarily ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
at all, to encounter with his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Affections, and unruly Appetites
within him; or with the deluſions of
the World's deceitful Objects without
him. I ſay, it's a great while, before
a right, and well-inform'd Reaſon, that
ſhould undertake Vertues Work, will
be tolerably able to exerciſe its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over his Affections and Actions,
or of paſſing a right Judgment upon
his own principal Good and Intereſt.


<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42467:152"/>
And eſpecially if it be true, (which
St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> averrs, as the Judgment of the
moſt learned Men of that Age) that
the natural Boundary of Youth is,<note place="margin">Circa triginta quippe annos, definie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt etiam hujus ſaeculi doctiſſimi homines, juventutem. <hi>De Civ. lib. 22. cap. 15</hi>

                  <p>And then, if all that while he allows

                        </gap>, De lib. educan.</note>
(as <hi>Plutarch</hi> fully repreſents them)
without any ſufficient Controul from his
yet immature, and unperfect Mind?</p>
                  <p>And when he is thus tumbling down
his youthful Precipice, if the Wiſdom of
<hi>Vertue</hi> ſtops him not, before the <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
of his time be paſt, he is in great
danger of encountring with another po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Enemy to Goodneſs. And that is,
with the Dominion and inſulting Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity


<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42467:153"/>
of a long-contracted habit of doing
Evil, or, at beſt, of living idly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently;
which habit, if it be not
timely reſcinded, will ſtrengthen it ſelf
every day more and more, like a ſhrunk
Nerve, till it grows inflexibly ſtubborn
againſt all remedy and relief, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately

may offer in Advice for his
undertaking wiſer meaſures of Living.
So that it is not ordinarily ſo frequent,
that men do get into a ſtate of Vertue,
either when they are very young, or
very old: not when they are very young,
for the reaſons already alledg'd; Nor
yet when very old, if they have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
their evil habits through the matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
part of their Lives; the proper ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
when men ſhould recover themſelves
from their former habituated follies, and
be rationally fix'd in the love and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>It's taken notice of, That <hi>Moſes</hi> took
that nick of time for his recovery:<note place="margin">Acts 7. 23.</note> For
(as the Texts inferr that obſervation)
he was full Forty Years old when he
ſeem'd to have begun that Mighty Work.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note>
He then unlooſen'd himſelf from the
Glories of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Court, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
the tranſient Pleaſures of it, and
engag'd himſelf into a courſe of Vertue;


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42467:153"/>
though he were ſure then to act it in a
ſtate of great afflictions, with the then-ſuffering
People of God. And for the
performance of which (as the reaſon of
the thing requir'd it) he plac'd his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
upon the Concerns of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
World:<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>For</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>he
had an Eye upon the recompence of Reward.</hi>
He durſt ſtay no longer, leſt a farther
adherence to his Vanity had captiv'd
him beyond the relief of his reaſon;
nor durſt he adventure to truſt his Soul
with any leſs encouragement, to engage
himſelf in that neceſſary Work, leſt he
had miſcarry'd in that moſt important
Enterprize for want of it.</p>
                  <p>It's true, I confeſs, that there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ſome good young men in the
World; but then it's obſerv'd, that their
vertue hath been (I ſpeak not of all) but
commonly contingent, or complexional;
that is, either as growing upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of a good Education and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
or as upon the Stock of their own
naturally-ſweet and tractable Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But then it hath alſo too often
been obſerv'd, That afterward thoſe
pregnant and promiſing Hopes of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Life, have become abortive, when
thoſe young men have been left to act
purely upon the ſtrength of their own


<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42467:154"/>
Minds and Reaſon. Like ſome Plants,
which we take notice of to thrive well,
while they feed only upon the nutriment
which the body of the Seed afforded
them, but when they come to grow
upon the ſtrength of the Ground only,
after all their firſt vernant ſhewes, have
wither'd away, through the weakneſs of
a defective ſoil: So many young men
have been commendably vertuous upon
the advantage of their own good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Education, who afterward have
fail'd, when they came to live abroad
in the World's wide Field.</p>
                  <p>Now, upon this whole conſideration
which I have made, concerning the time
of Youth, What can be ſuppos'd to be
offer'd to a young man, while he lives
ſubject to be over-rul'd by his paſſions
and natural appetites? Or, What Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
can be preſum'd to be ſtrong
enough to bring his Mind to any ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
attendance to the Counſels of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
amidſt the proſpect of ſo many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing
Objects, to divert him from it, but
an alarm from the moſt ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Concerns of another World?
Therefore, when <hi>Solomon</hi> advertiz'd the
vain young man,<note place="margin">Eccl. 12. ver. 1.</note> to <hi>Remember his Creator
in the days of his Youth,</hi> and had told
him,<note place="margin">ver. 13.</note> That nothing but <hi>Fearing God and


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42467:154"/>
keeping his Commandments,</hi> could make him
Happy, he obligeth his attendance to
that Sovereign Counſel, (as knowing
that nothing elſe could be ſufficient)
upon the Concerns of another World;
becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>God ſhall bring every
work into Judgment, with every ſecret thing,
whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let us, after all theſe
mention'd difficulties of being engag'd in
a courſe of Vertue, further conſider,
That he that deſigns to live vertuouſly,
ought alſo to ſuppoſe, that it is not only
poſſible, but very probable, that he muſt
live counter to the Examples (in one
kind or another) of the greater part of
Mankind: And ſometimes not only to
the Examples of them, with whom he
chuſeth to converſe, but oft-times even
of them upon whom he muſt neceſſarily
depend: and (which adds much to the
difficulty) very often to the Examples
of ſuch, whoſe Age, Station, Learning,
and Experience had given ſome credit to
looſe and vicious practices.</p>
                  <p>Now, if a man ſhall but ſeriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himſelf of the univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
prevalency of evil Examples, and
how, (if they be too general) like a
raging Torrent, they are apt to bear all
that's Vertuous down before them; and


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42467:155"/>
then ſhall conſider, how that prevalency
ariſeth not ſo much from any taking Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that there is in vicious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
Examples in themſelves, as from
that inclination that is naturally implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in all men, to be govern'd by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
rather than by any other method of
Conduct; the difficulty of being ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
muſt, on that account, be ſtill
very much encreas'd. It's known by
common obſervation, That Orations,
Sermons, dexterous Reaſonings, and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
attendance to Books, (though they
may very much influence, yet) are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally
found to be far leſs prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the natural temper of moſt
men, than is a conſtant Proſpect of actual
Preſidents and Examples, whitherſoever
they tend either to Good or Evil.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, our Saviour, in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Sermon upon the Mount, after he
had prefac'd it with Eight qualifications
of Mind, as neceſſarily requir'd in them
that intended to engage in the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his following Precepts, begins the
Sermon with that which he judg'd moſt
conſiderably conducing to a Good Life,
and that was, to make the Good actions
of his Hearers exemplary to one another.
<hi>(Mat. 5.)</hi> And as it was our Saviour's
prime care to promote the Benefit of a


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42467:155"/>
good Exemplification: So it hath been
ever ſince believ'd of ſuch as were to be
afterward the Subſtitutes of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
that they have the more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
prevail'd in their Miniſterial Offices,<note place="margin">Potior enim, eſt bene vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendi quam be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendi facultas.</note>
when their good Examples have given
Life to their other endeavours: And,
the building up of God's Church, hath
then moſt ſucceſsfully gone on, when
they have wrought with both Hands,
that is, both by Life and Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Now, this whole Diſcourſe, concerning
the nature and importance of Exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
amounts to this, That if there
be ſuch a natural Prevalency in all Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to controul the Minds and Lives of
men: And if there be ſo obſervably, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
in the World, ſo many ſuch Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
as will be encouraging Vice, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality,
and the Univerſal Neglects of
Religion; What an addition is it to the
difficulty of mens Undertaking to live
good and vertuous Lives? What Power
can ſtem ſuch a ſtrong Tide? or, What
encouragements can the Mind aſſume to
its ſelf, from any thing that this World
can tender, to reſtrain a man from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
a common Mode (perhaps at
that time moſt faſhionable) of ill-living,
for which he hath daily ſo many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents
before his Eyes? Surely nothing


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42467:156"/>
can inable him to bear up againſt ſo
powerful an oppoſition to Vertue, unleſs
he advanceth his Soul to be concern'd
in what relates to another World.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and Laſtly, They that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to live vertuouſly, that is, ſtrictly
ſo, beſides the mention'd inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of bad Examples, muſt alſo expect
to be entertain'd (more or leſs) with
as many diſcouragements, as the vitious
and immoral can poſſibly contrive. For
there is a malignant dispoſition in the
Minds of moſt men that are habitually
evil, which will commonly engage them
either in an open Enmity, or in a ſecret
Spite, againſt the Perſons of the Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
And in whatſoever other inſtances
their Malice ſhall fail them, yet they
will be ſure to put the Actions of the
Vertuous, let them be never ſo upright
and innocent, upon the rack of all
poſſible miſconſtructions for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>
                  <p>If ſuch Good men ſhall live quietly
and inoffenſively in the World, it muſt
be accounted from a puſillanimity and
meanneſs of Spirit. If in any inſtances
they be obſervably grateful or ingenious,
it's nothing elſe, but an effect of a weak
and untutor'd Judgment. If they can't
comply with ſome mens Riotiſm and


<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42467:156"/>
Debaucheries, 'tis Penury and ſtraitneſs
of Soul. If they be cheerful, they are
vain; if reſerv'd, 'tis Sullenneſs. If they
be generally civil and obliging in their
Behaviour, it muſt be Flattery, Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in publick Concerns, or baſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
upon deſign: And then, if they
keep diſtance, 'tis Pride and an unſociable
Singularity. If the Good man ſhall go
about to oblige such men by Kindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
they will hate him the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was in capacity to do them:
And if upon apparent affronts and abuſes
he be ready to offer terms of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
they will never forgive him the
Injury (as they will account it) of his
taking any notice at all of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs:
If the common buſineſs of
the World brings the Good man into
Company, he hears no body commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
but the Thriving, and the Cunning,
and no man applauded as Wiſe and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
but the Rich and the Succeſsful;
they are to be alwaies the beſt men (as
they call it) of the Neighbourhood,
howſoever unfurniſh'd in the Region of
their Minds, or how irregular and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
ſoever in the courſe of their
Lives. And while he is among them, if
he offers to talk to purpoſe, no man
liſtens to him: If he adviſeth well, none


<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42467:157"/>
attends his Counſel: If his indignation
againſt ſuch Trifles of Mankind, makes
him ſpeak a ſtout Word, that relates to
Vertue, or another World, there's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
an alarm given either for an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Sport, or a Quarrel. But if at any
time a ſtronger temptation, and a ſnare
laid, ſhall betray his vertuous Soul to
comply too far with the humour of the
looſe Society, it ſhall never be forgotten
to his reproach; and how ſoon and well
ſoever he ſhall retract his Surprize, yet
it ſhall be thought ſufficient to juſtifie
all the affronts and unkind uſages that
the immoral and vitious ſhall for ever
after deſign and offer upon him: And
it's well if his Poſterity eſcape.</p>
                  <p>And then, a further diſencourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, if he that deſigns to be Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
be of Honourable Extraction, it
ſhall be ſuggeſted to him, That his
ſtrictly manag'd Life, will leſſen him in
his Honour, if not degrade his Quality:
If he otherwiſe ſtands in good and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Circumſtances, he muſt expect (in
as many reſpects as they can) to be
made a prey to the Vitious, who ſhall
take the ſame pleaſure to do it, and to
boaſt of it, and ſhall be as little blam'd
for it, as he that robs an innocent
Church-man of his due, or that plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders


<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42467:157"/>
one, that refuſeth to be Diſloyal
in a time of Rebellion. As for that
Man's ſhare in ordinary civilities, ſuch as
keep up Societies in mutual Friendſhips,
he ſhall be ſure to have the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of them; and his ſtrict and
vertuous Life, ſhall ſet a mark upon
his door, and teach the common Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
to paſs it by, like a Houſe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with the Plague: And at laſt, they
ſhall grow ſo weary of his Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
that they will alwaies be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
enquiring (with the Evil Man in
the Pſalm, <hi>Pſal. 41. 5.) When ſhall he
die, and his Name periſh?</hi> Theſe, and ſuch
as theſe, are the diſcouragements, which
he that intends to lead a Vertuous Life,
may reaſonably propound to himſelf to
encounter with, from the evil part of
the World; not that I think, that every
Vertuous Man, and at all times alike,
ſhall be aſſaulted with every one of them,
in the manner and order that I have now
repreſented them; yet nevertheleſs, we
may be confident, That all Vertuous
Perſons (if ſtrictly ſo) do meet with
ſome of them, and ſome, with moſt
of them: And they that meet with
feweſt, conſidering their other menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
Incumbrances from within, and
without them, will find work enough


<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42467:158"/>
to bear up againſt them, that they may
keep their minds and lives cloſe to their
Vertuous Reſolutions. And then who
can imagine, That they ſhould entertain
their minds with the hope of any ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
as may elſewhere balance
their Reaſon, to over-rule ſo many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
but of thoſe only, which
they may ſuggeſt to themſelves, from
the favour of a Good GOD, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
eſpecially to the hopeful concerns
of another World? This the laſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty:
but Why did GOD permit all
this? That's the buſineſs of the next

or that Our Saviour ſhould ſay, That
<hi>His Yoke was eaſy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>and His Burden

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I Anſwer, that though Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
declared His Yoke to be eaſy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
yet is it a Yoke, and a Burden ſtill;
and ſo thoſe Metaphorical Expreſſions,
muſt ſuppoſe and import ſomething in
their proper meaning, that is ſevere and
difficult. And though His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not grievous, yet are they
nevertheleſs Commandments ſtill; that
is, reſtraints, limitations, and boundaries
of ſomething, that Men are apt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
their natural Freedom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, That that eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and non-grievouſneſs may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
but as comparatively of ſomething
that is harder, and more oppreſſive. And
that is, either as to the bondages of
the Moſaical Inſtitution, or as to the
Slavery and Drudgery of living under
the intolerable Dominion and Tyranny
of ſinful Habits; which notion of eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in thoſe Two comparative Reſpects,
doth not at all ſuperſede what I have
repreſented concerning the difficulties of
living a Vertuous and Religious Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:42467:159"/>
3. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The Evangelical Vertues
may be repreſented as eaſy, as they are in
a more general account accommodable
to right Reaſon, and as they are in
themſelves more approvable to a mans
natural underſtanding: and therefore
can't be thought grievous to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
part of himſelf, (which is
eſpecially himſelf, and denominates him
a Man) abſtractly conſidered, how
troubleſome and difficult ſoever the
practice of them may be in a complex
and compounded Notion of himſelf;
that is, as he is made up of ſo many
inferiour paſſions, inclinations, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
appetites, as I have repreſented the
caſe, in the former Section.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I Anſwer, that His Yoke,
Burden, and Commandments may be
found the more easy, and leſs grievous
with reſpect to thoſe excellent diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Mind, with which every
true Diſciple of CHRIST that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
a Profeſſion of his Religion,
muſt neceſſarily be ſuppos'd to be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd;
that is, with meekneſs and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of heart, ſuch a ſubmiſſive and
humble temper of Mind, as he there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth
to, in the ſame period of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
as learn'd by his own Example,
will make his Yoke ſo much the eaſier,


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42467:159"/>
and the practical Obſervance of his
Commandments ſo much the leſs grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to him, that deſigns to live a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Religious Life.</p>
                  <p>5. Laſtly I reply, that thoſe fair ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of the eaſineſs of the Chriſtian
Vertues, may be founded upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of a future world, and with reſpect
to the great rewards of that Bleſſed
State; for the attainment of which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ought reſpectively to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hard, that is poſſible, as the bittereſt
Doſe is chearfully taken upon an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
proſpect of Health, and as the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
hard adventure is made light of,
upon a fore-aſſurance of the import of his
rich floating Cargo. And this ſolves the
firſt Exception.</p>
                  <p>But then Secondly, our Sceptick Dares
arraign the Equity and Goodneſs of
GOD to Mankind; and ſaith, That if
Almighty GOD had ever ſeriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that Men ſhould live Good and
Vertuous Lives, upon which, His Divine
Favour, and all their own Happineſs,
ſhould chiefly and neceſſarily depend,
(as it's pretended) he would never have
been ſo unkind, as to put them upon
ſuch a way of Living, whoſe terms ſhould
be ſo hard and hazardous, and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be perform'd without ſo many ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42467:160"/>
difficulties, and diſcouragements; but
would rather have oblig'd them ſo to
live, upon conditions which might have
had the ſame eaſe and ſecurity, by which
other Animals attain their proper ends;
from which they are in no natural dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to depart, by any wilful miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of their own.</p>
                  <p>My Anſwer to this bold Charge upon
thoſe glorious Attributes of God, in which
he chiefly delighteth, ſhall be by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſufficient reaſons to juſtify God, why
he was pleaſed to allow Mankind the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of being Good and Vertuous, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch ſeverely difficult, and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
terms, and conditions. And the
Reaſons are theſe Five.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Had not man ſome ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and diſcouragements to contend with
in his attempts to be Vertuous; the very
name or notion of Vertue muſt have been
inſignificant to all the purpoſes of its
Reaſon, and Recommendation. If there
were no enemy to conflict with, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
danger to be incountred, there could
be no reaſonable account given either of
courage, or conqueſt; And if it were
naturally eaſy, and commonly obvious,
to be Learned and Knowing, what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
were it to be accounted a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher?
So if the world had no enchanting


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42467:160"/>
Objects, no ſenſual Pleaſures, no admir'd
Splendour and Greatneſs in it, what Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
were it to oppoſe temptations to Pride
and Vanity, Revenge and Arrogancy, or
to be conſtantly engag'd in mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcentions,
and in an univerſal practice
of living peaceably and doing good?
And if ſome parts of mans nature had
no contrary propenſions, and averſations;
it would be no more to be Vertuous,
than to Eat or Sleep; no more for a Man
to be Temperate, than for a Lamb; his
chaſtity would be no more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
than that of a Flower, and his pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable
and innocent Converſation, would
be juſt ſo much accountable, as that of
a Tree or Stone.</p>
                  <p>So that if the matter be cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
it muſt not only acquit God's
Juſtice, that he hath permitted (of which
men are too apt to complain) ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
difficulties of being Vertuous,
but it would highly advance his Goodneſs,
as that thereby he had a gracious contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
how to make man poſſibly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being Good and Vertuous at all.
And therefore when ſome men ſhall go
about, upon that account, to make their
vitious lives, and their reſolutions not to
amend, the more excuſable to themſelves
and others; and when others that mean


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42467:161"/>
better, ſhall be always murmuring and
complaining at every incumbrance they
meet with in the way of Vertue, both
the one and the other ſort of men, ought
to be inform'd, that all that while they
are moſt ungratefully arraigning and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
one of the choiceſt inſtances
of God's Infinitely Wiſe Love to, and
Care of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>2. But then Secondly, another Reaſon,
why God Almighty was pleas'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
thoſe Incumbrances and Difficulties
to be ſo great (as they are to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
by thoſe five mention'd Inſtances)
was upon a further deſign of his Love
and Goodneſs to Mankind, in order to
promote a greater advance of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
in another World: That is, that
the will of man might by thoſe diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
be the more duly and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
balanc'd in his choice of being Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
ſo as to be capable of thoſe vaſt
Rewards and Bleſſings, which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for, and promis'd to him. And
the Reaſon, is becauſe upon God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of thoſe extraordinary returns of
Reward and Bleſſing in another World;
the very ſence and expectation of them
would otherwiſe have over-balanc'd the
freedom of his choice of being Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
too much on the one hand, towards


<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42467:161"/>
a determination of his will, and a neceſſity
of chuſing, had not the greatneſs of thoſe
difficulties and diſcouragements ſo coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalanc'd
his mind and pois'd his will,
for a more equal freedom in his election of
Vertue: ſo that, had GOD Almighty
been pleas'd, that the way of Vertue
and Religion, ſhould have been more
eaſy; that is, leſs incumber'd with thoſe
difficulties &amp; diſcouragements, it ought to
be reaſonably preſum'd, That God would
have communicated to the mind of Man,
lower Apprehenſions of that Future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;
and ſo the freedom of His Will,
would have been balanc'd for a leſſer
ſtreſs of choice, and conſequently with
leſſer hazard. But then it muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
as reaſonably preſum'd, That the
Happineſs attainable as ſuch a Reward
in the end, would have been proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
to ſuch an eaſy, and leſs hazardous
Choice. Waters are obſerv'd to riſe to no
higher pitch, than according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
they have from the original Spring.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, I ſay it was a mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of GOD's Wiſdom, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
thoſe difficulties and incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to be ſo great and numerous, that
thereby he might make the hoped for
Happineſs, proportionable for Mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
balanc'd Choice of ſo much Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42467:162"/>
as was neceſſary for ſuch an attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But then His Goodneſs is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be admir'd, that all this ſhould be
done on deſign, to advance him to ſo
much the higher and nobler degrees of
Happineſs in another World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> It's very reaſonable to believe,
That GOD was pleas'd to permit thoſe
difficulties and diſcouragements, and to
allow the poſſibility of being Vertuous,
upon thoſe hard Terms, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
might act his Divine Favour to the
vertuous part of Mankind, as near as
poſſible, to the meaſures of Juſtice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
as well as of Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
That is, that thereby he might
make the free Donations of ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
rewarding Bleſſings to the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
the more accountable and (as
it were) the more justifiable to His
own infinite Reaſon and Wiſdom; which
St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 5. 6.</note> calls <hi>the Righteous Judgment of
GOD;</hi> that ſo all His Divine Attributes,
might be the better balanc'd in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
His Creature, Man, compleatly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
And who knows not, That it is
ordinary for many wiſe and good Men
(more eſpecially Commanders in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies)
to offer ſuch Employments to
their Friends and Favourites, (whom
they deſign to advance in Repute and


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42467:162"/>
Preferment) as have the greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and hazard in them, for no other
end, but to juſtify to their own minds,
Diſcretion, in being nobly kind to ſuch
adventurers; and in which they may
have more ſatiſfaction to their generous
minds, than for any manner of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that they may receive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by ſuch their Friends and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
hazardous Engagements? And
then, Why may not we as reaſonably
have the ſame Thoughts of a Wiſe and
Merciful GOD, as to the caſe in hand?
This the Third Reason.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly.</hi> GOD was ſo far pleas'd to
permit, (I could ſay to order) that
every Perſon might encounter with
ſuch oppoſitions, difficulties and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements;
not only that His own
mighty Favours to them, might appear
the more reaſonable to Himſelf; but
that alſo (to the greater Glory and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
of His Juſtice and Goodneſs)
they might approveably appear ſo to all
His created rational Beings, <hi>When he
ſhall come to be admired in all them that
believe in that Day;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 10.</note> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, as to thoſe Beings that
had already ſtruggled through thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and conquered thoſe incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42467:163"/>
and are arriv'd at their Reward in
another World, How much will it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Glory of an infinite Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
when they ſhall recount (as it's
reaſonably imagin'd they will) what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of their Fellow Saints had done
and ſuffered for Vertue; and what hard
Adventures they had made in the time
of their Probation in the former World,
to keep up their Vertuous and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Integrities? I ſay, How can it but
advance the Glory of GOD, that all
the glorify'd Saints and Angels can be
able to ſay, That ſuch a man is not
in the bleſſed Place, altogether by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
kindneſs with particular reſpects of
his Perſon only, and ſo to have nothing
to applaud, but ſuch a meer and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Love; but that in the free donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Happineſs they can obſerve that
all other the Divine Attributes did concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with His Love; and ſo they may
have Reaſon, as to magnify his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Juſtice, and Equity, for the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
meaſures he took to bring him
to that bleſſed State in ſuch a manner, ſo
alſo His tranſcendent Love, in beſtowing
that bleſſing at all ſo graciouſly upon him?
And then on the other ſide, thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
beings, who by their Cowardice
had refus'd to conflict with thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42467:163"/>
and diſcouragementr of living Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Lives, and had thereby cheated
themſelves out of all thoſe future Bleſſings,
upon the temptations of a few vaniſhing
Pleaſures, and a little tranſient ſenſual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction,
I ſay, why may it not be
thought a wiſe ordination in God to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
thoſe incumbrances in being Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that when thoſe unhappy Souls ſhall
obſerve, that God had beſtowed thoſe
mighty Bleſſings upon thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd
to their Vertuous Living, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred,
they might for ever juſtify his
equity, that it was not for nothing, or
for what was very inconſiderable, or for
what was not in their own power to
have done, as well as in theirs, that
he was pleas'd in his free love to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
thoſe mighty bleſſings upon the
Vertuous in that happy apartment; ſo
that in both reſpects, both to the Good
and Evil, God's deſign was to have his
Juſtice magnify'd as well as his Mercy.
Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 6.</note> calls both thoſe events,
a Juſt and Righteous thing, or Act with
God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Fifthly</hi> and Lastly, God was pleas'd
that man might not go through with
a Vertuous ſtate, without thoſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and incumbrances, that the Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42467:164"/>
might not only enjoy the hopes and
expectations of thoſe future Bleſſings at
preſent with a more advanc'd inward
pleaſure and value (as having pay'd ſo
dear for them) but that they might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
enjoy them in the other world,
with ſo much the greater ſatisfaction to
their own happy minds; And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they may be ſensible of ſomething
done by themſelves (though it be very
inconſiderable in reſpect of the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ſuperredundancy of their reward)
why they ſhould be conferr'd upon them
by a Juſt and Merciful God. For as a
happineſs that comes in any degree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a notion and nature of a Reward,
(being therefore the more accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the mind of a Rational Creature)
cannot but be preferrable to any kind
of happineſs, that is meerly and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionately
gratuitous; ſo muſt the ſence
of the happineſs, to him that hath
hardly adventur'd for it, be ſo much the
more welcome and valuable in his own
ſence and eſteem.</p>
                  <p>Now all this was ſo ordered by a Wiſe
and Good GGD, that the Vertuous
might be the more rationally happy,
and ſo the more agreeably to their own
nature in the other world. This the
laſt Reaſon. And thus this third and laſt

               <p>THE <hi>Fourth</hi> Argument to
evince the Certainty of a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State's Exiſtence, is
ſounded upon Mankind's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
born naturally ſubject to ſo many,
and thoſe ſo greatly afflictive Troubles
and Calamities, as that they exceed, both
in number and quality, all the Miſeries
of the whole created World beſides. So
that, if their whole Duration ſhould be
limited to the term only of their preſent
mortal Lives, as a non-Exiſtence were
rather to be choſen, than to enjoy a
Being upon ſuch hard terms, ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but reflect upon the Infinite Wiſdom,
Juſtice, and Goodneſs of GOD, who
by His own ſole Soveraign Will and


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42467:167"/>
Pleaſure, ſhould chuſe to make a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be naturally ſo Unhappy.</p>
               <p>And if the Honour of thoſe Glorious
Attributes of GOD, and Man's hard
Opinion of his own Being, can no other
way be poſſibly ſolv'd, but by the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of a <hi>Future State's Exiſtence,</hi> in
which Mankind might be made capable of
a Redreſs and Compenſation, for the Evils
to which their Nature hath ſubjected
them: And if it ſhall alſo further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
That for the better obtaining ſuch
a Redreſs and Compenſation in that
State, all thoſe Evils, to which they are
naturally ſo ſubjected, may be found to
be deſignedly Subſervient and Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
then it cannot but demonſtrably
follow, That GOD Almighty hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

to come.</p>
               <p>Now, that this Argument, thus ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

ſhall divide the management of its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42467:167"/>
into theſe Three Parts or
Chapters.</p>
               <p>In the Firſt, I ſhall endeavour to
demonſtrate, That Mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are naturally
born ſubject to more and greater Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and Miſeries, than the whole viſible
created World beſides. And in effecting
this, I muſt be neceſſitated to ſpread
my Diſcourſe into a larger Explanation
than, perhaps, every Reader may judge
ſo needful in his firſt Thoughts.</p>
               <p>In the Second Chapter, I deſign to
repreſent ſuch intolerable Conſequences,
as muſt, in Reaſon, be inferr'd upon
that Obſervation, that is, ſuch as cannot
poſſibly conſiſt with the Honour or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Divine Attributes, nor with
Man's tolerably-well Enjoyment of his
Being, whether as ſocially or indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
conſidered.</p>
               <p>In the Third Chapter it's intended to
demonſtrate, That the ſuppoſal of a <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
World's Exiſtence,</hi> can only ſolve
all thoſe intolerable Conſequences; and


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42467:168"/>
will alſo manifeſtly evince, That all
thoſe Evils, to which Man is naturally
born ſubject, were deſignedly ordered,
and permitted by the Divine Wiſdom
and Goodneſs, to be inſtrumentally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter I ſhall endeavour to
repreſent, That Mankind are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
born ſubject to more and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Miſeries and Calamities, than the
whole viſible created World beſides;
and that by their Nature, with reſpect
only to their mortal Lives, they are the
moſt Unfortunate of Beings. And I
ſhall manage the Proof of this part of
the Argument, in Three Sections.</p>
               <p>1. In the Firſt Section, I deſign (as
particularly as I can) to give an account
of the common Evils, to which Men
are born naturally ſubject, to the laſt
period of their mortal Lives.</p>
               <p>2. In the Second, I ſhall repreſent the
Opinions of the Great and Learned


<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42467:169"/>
Men of the World, in that Caſe, as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative
Atteſtations of the Truth
of it.</p>
               <p>3. In the Third, I ſhall offer humane
Evils to a compariſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all thoſe, to
which all the other parts of the whole
viſible World beſides are ſubjected; and
therein I ſhall more fully diſcuſs the
Caſe of Brute Animals, in which our
Theiſts aſſume no ſmall confidence for
their Cauſe.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Section I.</head>
                  <p>IN this Firſt Section I am oblig'd to
give an Account of the common
Evils of Mankind, to which they are
naturally ſubjected. But, in doing this,
I ſhall not pretend minutely to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
every one of them; for that were
to undertake an Office, as difficult as
preciſely to number the Stars or Sands.
But the better to explain the Truth of
the allegation, I ſhall only take Leave to
repreſent ſome general Heads, or ſorts of
thoſe common Evils, which I will preſume
to place, as in ſo many ſeveral Rooms
of an Imaginary Houſe, into which I
may invite the Readers obſervation, that
he may thereby be, (as it were) an Eye-witneſs


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42467:169"/>
of what I ſhall offer to his
Belief.</p>
                  <p>1. And in the firſt Apartment of that
Houſe of Calamity, let me tender to his
view, thoſe Nations and Places, where
all the wretched Sufferers by the Three
great and aſtoniſhing Plagues and Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Mankind, the Sword, Famine,
and Peſtilence (when they happen in
the World) do, at the then preſent
time, live and bear their ſeveral ſhares
in the ſad effects and conſequences of
ſuch calamitous Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>And here our Obſerver cannot but
take notice of ſo many, and ſuch ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
ſpectacles of humane miſery, that
the very Proſpect it ſelf (though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
were perfectly ſecure from every
one of them) will hardly give him leave
to think, That if he were now to chuſe
a Being, (though otherwiſe accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the faireſt conveniencies) upon
condition to be a conſtant Beholder of
ſuch Objects of Miſery, he would not be
very fond to accept it upon thoſe terms.
But certainly, thoſe men themſelves, that
are at any preſent time ſenſible of thoſe
terrible occaſions of humane Calamity,
cannot but think it their great miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to Be at all; if there were no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of a Better ſtate to ſucceed, by


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42467:170"/>
the hopes of which, they might relieve
the preſent ſence of their own confus'd
conditions; and, which might atone
their oppreſſive Wiſhes, that they had
never Been at all.</p>
                  <p>And though theſe great Diſtreſſes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
but ſeldom in the World, and but
at ſome periods of Time, yet every man
is born naturally ſubject to them all;
and knows nothing to the contrary, but
that he may bear his Portion in every
one of them, before any Cauſe or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ſhall be ſo kind to him, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
his miſerable mortal Being, to
prevent them.</p>
                  <p>2. Through this extraordinarily lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Apartment, let me lead our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
into a Room call'd, <hi>The Lazar;</hi> that
is, a place where ordinarily all the Sick,
the Languiſhing, and the greatly Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
lay along on Beds and Couches,
groaning and complaining under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Preſſures of their preſent numerous
Diſtempers:</p>
                  <p>Of which there be ſo many ſeveral
kinds, that the Learned Phyſicians ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Four Hundred, as the proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of their Art; beſides the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
accidents upon Mens Limbs, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
from without, which are the proper
buſineſs of the Chirurgeon's Skill and
Employment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:42467:170"/>
And of the Diſeaſes, in which the
Phyſicians are concern'd, beſides thoſe
that are promiſcuously incident to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in general, ſome are Hereditary,
and deſcend from Parents, without any
fault at all of the Diſeased. Others there
be, that are proper to their Countries,
and are call'd Endemial, ſuch as be the
<hi>Bronchocele</hi> to them that live about the
<hi>Alpes,</hi> the Kings-evil to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
Conſumption to the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> and Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
to the Northern Nations: to all which
Diſeaſes, the afflicted might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
neither Cauſe nor Occaſion.
Then others there be, which are call'd
Epidemical Diſeaſes, with which, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the greateſt part of a Nation is at
once unexpectedly surpriz'd from the
concurrence of ſome malignant, and
ſometimes, unaccountable Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>And now, if a Catalogue were made
by thoſe Perſons, whoſe Calling and
Imployment it is, to attend the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of that part of Mankind, which at
all times ſome where or other lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Hands and Cures, of all the
ſeveral calamitous Circumſtances, which
ſuch afflicted Perſons, and their Families
endure, it would eaſily ſatiſfy any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
mind, how much a non-Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
were to be preferr'd to ſuch Mens


<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42467:171"/>
preſent Beings; if they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
That GOD has allowed the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
an aſſurance of a better State
to come.</p>
                  <p>3. From a view of theſe woeful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to whoſe Calamities, Mens Bodies
have expoſed them, I lead our Obſerver
into a Third Room, where all that are
diſordered in Mind, make up a Great
and miſerable Society. And there the
Sick and the Diſeaſed are more numerous,
and their diſorders by
far more afflictive and
uneaſy,<note place="margin">—Morbi perniciores ſunt, pluresque, quam Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, <hi>&amp;c. Tuſc. Quest. lib.</hi> 3.</note> than thoſe of
the Body, as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
obſerves. Now
the Diſeaſes of the Mind (as he there
accounts them) are Madneſs of all ſorts;
Envy,<note place="margin">Diog. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. lib. 7. de Vita Zenon.</note> Anguiſh, Sorrow, anxious Cares
and Fears; to which <hi>Zeno,</hi> in his enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration
of them, adds Jealouſy, and
Confuſion, or Perplexity of Thoughts,
Emulation, and Terrours, Shame, and
an unweldy Tireſomeneſs, or Laſſitude
of Mind.</p>
                  <p>With any one of which, whoſoever
hath his Head affected and incumber'd,
will be hardly able to allow himſelf
any conſiderable ſatifactions in the ſence
of his own Being, though he were
otherwiſe accomodated, with all other


<pb n="293" facs="tcp:42467:171"/>
the kindeſt circumſtances of living:
and for this, take great <hi>Plutarch's</hi> Words,

from this diſmal place, I ſhall preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhew him in the next apartment, an
infinite number of ſuch, as are made
unhappy and unfortunate by the Evils,
which Men are every day ſtudying to
bring reciprocally one upon another:
and for that Reaſon it is, that when

and Poiſonous qualities of Plants

than are the ill humours of men,

that thoſe creatures
do commonly ſuſpend
their Cruelties to thoſe
of the ſame kind; but
it is otherwiſe in men,
the objects of whoſe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
actions and intentions, are chiefly
thoſe of the ſame ſpecies with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>So that if we would but count the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Oppreſſions, ſecret Frauds, and all
the arts of Falſhood and Subtlety which
are every day made uſe of, to invade
and violate mens Rights, and Fortunes;


<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42467:172"/>
And if we could take a ſufficient notice,
of what private inſinuations, and ſpiteful
invectives, are daily invented and acted,
to undermine and blaſt one anothers ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and reputations; and if we ſhould
then reckon the intolerable practices of
revenge, as they are every where proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
by the powerful intereſt of great
men, by the vexatious methods of the
Law, and by the common Malice of the
world: and if to the complaints of thoſe,
were added the mournings of oppreſſed
Widows, Parents tears, Brethrens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
fewds, Childrens hardſhips, and
all other the oppreſſions and unkindneſſes
which many men endure, at the hands
ſometimes even of ſuch, who by all the
obligations of Duty and Gratitude, ſhould
be juſt and kind; I ſay, if all theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
which men ſuffer one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
were conſidered and accounted;
there would be caſes of Miſery enough
to afflict and tire out all the Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
Ears and Hearts, that are at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to hear and reſent them, and (if
there were no other World to relieve
them) to lament, that ſo many diſtreſſed
Perſons had ever been at all.</p>
                  <p>But if that which is call'd Friendſhip,
may be preſum'd to abate this ſevere
repreſentation; and if it be objected, that


<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42467:173"/>
ſome Philoſophers have thought that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
endearment, a ſufficient compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for all the miſchiefs and evils, which
they can otherwiſe receive from the reſt
of Mankind: I may anſwer with one of
the wiſeſt of them,<note place="margin">Dio. Laer. lib. 5. De vita Ariſt.</note> (as <hi>Phavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi>
relates it of <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> when

could by no temptations become uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,

                     <hi>and to interpoſe a relief

affirm with the Philoſopher, that there is
no Friend at all; yet I think I may ſay,
there are very few ſuch to be found in
the world, or at leaſt not ſo many, that
in any tolerable degree, can compenſate


<pb n="297" facs="tcp:42467:173"/>
for the innumerable miſchiefs and miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
that Good men, and even moſt men,
endure, by the malice and falſhood of the
reſt of mankind. To whom the kind miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
of the trueſt Friends, are oft-times
no ſmall addition of trouble; That is, when
their indiſcreet, though ſincere affections,
do prove as vexatious as the hatred of an
Enemy; as <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerves. And the
truth is, it's hardly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,<note place="margin">Saepe nihil intereſſe inter amicorum munera, &amp; inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum tela.

that the excellent
union of Souls, and the
entire management of
true Friendſhip, can be
ſuppoſed or expected to
be any where elſe found
but among thoſe, who are qualified with
that Honeſt and Religious Temper of
mind, to which the hopes and fears of
a Future World, have raiſed their Souls,
above all ſuch temptations, as might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to act unfriendly or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</p>
                  <p>5. But if this Room be not a ſufficient
Proſpect, to convince my Obſerver of
the Truth of my Suppoſition, I will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
him into another Place, almoſt as
large as the World it ſelf, where he ſhall
hear a mix'd company of all ſorts of
men, continually repining and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the particular Evils, that inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably


<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42467:174"/>
accompany every different condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and quality of Life.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay of the Cares and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy
Affairs of the Rich and Great, to
ſupport an empty ſhow in the world?
What of the Streights and Improviſions,
the Contempts and Bondages of the Poor
and Low, and how almoſt the whole
ſpecies of mankind are made Drudges,
and driven about like Machins, to ſerve
the Pride, Pleaſures, and Profits of a few?
And if it were poſſible to find out a man,
that had no kind of viſible Miſfortune
upon him at preſent, yet are there rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to be given,<note place="margin">Ita enim foelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, ſe, niſi tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur, premit. <hi>Sen. Epiſt.</hi>
                     </note> that his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
proſperity (as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher

                  <p>In this place it is, that the Married

to act their own Repentance in
the ſtate they are in at preſent; and
when their conditions are chang'd, they
are condemning themſelves for believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own Arguments and Reaſons
why they deſired it. Here the Publick
and the Private, the Inhabitants of the
City and Country, are arraigning their
preſent States, by the various Opinions


<pb n="299" facs="tcp:42467:174"/>
of thoſe, who had ſtudied to enquire
and determine, whether of the two ways
of living were incumbred with leſſer or
greater inconveniencies; and while each of
them are complaining of their own preſent

change with the contrary; which when
they have once done, they commonly
encounter a new Tide of greater Diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that men of ſeveral Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings

invidiouſly admiring the conveniencies

                  <p>So that by this natural miſfortune it
comes to paſs, that Men are alwaies
tempting themſelves to make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own Contentments; and (if the
Religious Concerns of a Future World
do not determine them) to oppoſe the
little ſatisfactions they might poſſibly
otherwiſe enjoy, in the ſtate they are


<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42467:175"/>
in at preſent, by haraſſing their thoughts
with the unavoidable Evils, with which
every one of them is naturally born ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to be incumber'd. But that which
mightily adds to this kind of Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
is, That the more fine, modeſt, and
ingenuous the minds of Men are, they
will alwaies be the more afflictively ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of their leſſer Miſfortunes, and the
more vexatiouſly tyrannical to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in greater. A ſweet Soul is
turned away from his Benefactor with
a rebuking Look, and frets upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs,
while the Bold and the Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
can withſtand a thouſand Denials,
and remembers no affronts to his diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
                  <p>This is the laſt room of the Afflicted,
in our imaginary Houſe of Humane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.</p>
                  <p>Now, if theſe ſeveral apartments were
brought into one proſpect, and that I
could ſhew my Obſerver at once all
thoſe, that are at any time afflicted in
their ſeveral Rooms, the World of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
would look more like one common
Hoſpital of the Miſerable, than a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Beings, which are preſumed to be
Superiour in order, and the Divine Care
to all other the viſible parts of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
beſides.</p>

                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:42467:175"/>
But then, if it be objected, That there
be many who have had the good hap to
paſs away a conſiderable part of their
Lives with tolerable eaſe and ſatisfaction:
That is, Suppoſe ſome young men, who
in the ſtrength and vigour of their time,
are at preſent gratifying their ſenſual
Appetites in the ſeveral Pleaſures of their
Youth: Or, ſuppoſe ſome others of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Progreſs in their ſpace of living,
who are now applauding themſelves in
their Skill and Succeſs, for the attaining
a more than ordinarily conſiderable
Portion of Knowledge, Wealth, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
I ſay, Suppoſe that any of, or
all theſe, ſhould reclaim againſt the
Truth of what I have ſaid, yet I muſt
tell them, they are all to conſider
(though nothing elſe ſhould ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to interrupt their <hi>Eutopian</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)
that if they ſhould live towards
that boundary of time, which GOD
and Nature hath appointed for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
duration of humane Life, they all
muſt aſſuredly expect (and that expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alone will be no ſmall abatement of
the Pleaſure they pretend to take in any
Enjoyment whatſoever, if they look no
further than their preſent ſtate) that a
conſiderable portion of their days muſt be
worn away at laſt, with the labour and


<pb n="302" facs="tcp:42467:176"/>
ſorrow, pains and wearineſs, contempt
and uſeleſſneſs, decays of Senſe, and loſs
of Strength, and with other the many
Calamities, naturally incident to old Age.
Of which <hi>Stoboeus</hi> hath collected ſuch a
Deſcription from Wiſe

Horrour and dreadful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation.
For, if their Proprieties
be then too narrow, they muſt bear the
ſhame of being a Burthen to the World;
and if their Enjoyments be very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
unkind Poſterity will be apt to make
promiſing Inſpections into their years;
and will be ready to think, and perhaps
to ſay, (if Religion grounded upon the
Hopes and Fears of a Future World pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
it not) that their continuance is
an unhappy Obſtruction to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Succeſſor's long wiſh'd for

behold how much a ſtranger a poor old

                  <p>Now, theſe Offices were very hard,
and (in the Sence of men that own

yet the men that contrived and uſed

by ſuch Expedients of releaſe, was
very ſhort, and comparatively more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible

continued in the wearineſs and pains,


<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42467:177"/>
ſcorns and ſorrows, and other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to which they knew a long old Age
would have expoſed their Friends. And
that if they had lived it out, to its laſt
natural period,<note place="margin">Stultus eſt, qui non exiguà temporis mercede, magnae rei aleam redemit. Paucos longiſſima Senectus ad mortem ſine injuriâ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulit. <hi>Ex. lib. 8. cap.</hi> 59.</note> (as <hi>Seneca</hi>
tells us) they muſt have
done it ſo much to their

inconvenience. But by
this ſad Scene, in which
men act their old Age,
the natural Tragedy of Man's declining
time is not yet fully concluded: Nor
doth it determine all his mortal Infelicity.
And therefore, that which makes the Caſe
yet much harder, is, that all thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
miſeries may conclude with a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
conflict at laſt, before the uneaſie
Mind can ordinarily be looſen'd from its

                  <p>They are ſtill to dye: And if that laſt
Epilogue alone were truly conſider'd and
repreſented, in all its ordinarily natural
circumſtances, the enjoyment of ſuch a
trifling Being as is a mortal Life, would,
on that very account, be thought an
unequal compenſation, for this laſt Evil
of it only. But, if men could be made
throughly ſenſible of what ſome dying


<pb n="305" facs="tcp:42467:177"/>
Perſons endure, there would be but a
few, (if it were offer'd to trial, and to
their choice) that would be eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to accept of a mortal Exiſtence,
with that one ſevere condition; if there
ſhould be no ſtate in Future, whoſe
poſſible Happineſs might balance the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their choice, to Be at all.</p>
                  <p>For, Who can be otherwiſe aſſured,
but that in his bitter Agony of Dying,
he may not only endure as exquiſite
Tortures, as may even exceed the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the moſt barbarous Tyrants,
but (which is worſe to a generous mind)
that he may die in ſuch circumſtances,
as to be made a ſpectacle of Contempt,
by the undecent effects of a confuſed
and diſorder'd Reaſon: And that ſo, in
both reſpects, he may go out of the
World, like a Malefactor and a Fool, both
at once. And ſurely, upon the thoughts
of this laſt reſpect it was, that that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Author of the <hi>Religio Medici</hi>
(a man not to be thought on by them
that truly know him, without Love and
Honour) could affirm, <hi>That he was not

Now, upon the whole matter, If a poor
mortal ſhall conſider, that after all the
foremention'd miſeries of humane Life,
this laſt completion of its Calamity (of
whoſe approach he knows not, but that
every next day may bring him the ſad

That Mans natural ſubjection to ſuch

made him (as I firſt ſuggeſted) the

                  <p>IN this Section I ſhall more ſtrictly
account, how Mankind in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
are comparatively by their
very nature, more unfortunate in
their Beings, than all other the parts of

I ſhall there attack the Grand Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which the Theiſts make uſe of,
concerning Brute Animals.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let our Obſerver in his moſt

Univerſe, (the caſe of Brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
I ſhall account for by its ſelf)
from the mighty Bodies above, to the

they had all the ingenious Societies in
the World, to make it their whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
to attend the notices of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
orders, figures, and manners of
Exiſtence. And I am ſure, the iſſue
will be, that a mighty occaſion would
be given to advance Mens minds to a
greater admiration of their Creator's
Power and Wiſdom; an abundance of
Nature's Phaenomena would be ſolv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>


                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:42467:181"/>
but as to inſtances of miſery and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
among thoſe Beings, they would
not be ſo much as once nam'd, or
thought on. A Theme, which no Man
ever attempted, or would adventure at,
unleſs he deſign'd to teach men to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
the Honour of that Great CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOUR,
whoſe perfection of Goodneſs
and Eſſential Happineſs, could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a thought of making any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
naturally, that is purpoſely, and
neceſſarily unhappy.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if our Obſerver deſigns a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of all inanimate Beings, his
thoughts are preſently diſcharg'd of all
ſuſpicion of their unhappineſs.</p>
                  <p>The Heavens or Earth, or which of
them it is, that is daily moved about,
is not wearied with its Rapid Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The bright and burning Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

their own Flames: The Starrs of leſſer
Magnitude, are not emulous of, nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by thoſe of the ſuperiour Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
The Plants are not unfortunate
by the Wounds they receive, when

nor are the Rocks diſturbed, when they
are torn open for Materials to ſerve the
Health or Fortunes of Men; nor are
the ſeveral natural Cauſes, that act

their Powers to ſerve the Univerſe,
tir'd or incumber'd with their buſy and

                  <p>As for what concerns Brute Animals,
I muſt aſſault the ſtrongeſt Hold, on

and ſay, What neceſſity is there of a
ſuppoſal of the real Exiſtence of a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State to recompenſe Men, after
their calamitous Lives and Deaths, more
than the Brute Animals, who alſo are

                  <p>To all which it's anſwered, Firſt, that
it is not true when its affirmed, that
Brute Animals miſeries (if in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety

to find out their own Cures, and

and from an impulſe,
which they have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Original of
all Motion. Hence it is,
that they toil not for
Manufactures to cover them, nor do they
uſe Engines fetch'd from the bottoms of
Mountains for their Armature, to defend
them. Their parturitions are eaſy, their
declenſion to their natural period's but
a very little varied from the vigour of
their perfect Age. And when men are

of their Felicity, that he paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     <hi>that are free from
ſuch Calamities, as Men endure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for ſuch as die for mans uſe, that is no
more than a kind haſtning them to their
quiet Annihilations; a benefit, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
poor oppreſſed Slaves, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that live in calamitous conditions,
and even ſome in their proſperous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
would judge an acceptable
Relief, if Nature would allow it them.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, I anſwer, that Brute A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
in whatſoever they endure, and
howſoever their Senſes, and ſenſitive Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
may be affected, are yet whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
freed from all the oppreſſions of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
mind; which properly imports
the ſpecial reaſon of all real Miſery.
From which, if Rational Agents in their
Calamities, were as much exempted, they
would not in moſt caſes ſo much conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(in compariſon of what they ſuffer
by the Minds concurrence) the common
Evils, to which their Natures have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
expoſed them.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that Brute Animals have
no diſcurſive antecedent fears of dangers,


<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42467:183"/>
before they come; nor can they be intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectually
ſenſible of their own infelicities
when they are upon them, nor do they ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully
account them, when they are paſt.
As for thoſe mournful Poſtures, Sighs,
and Out-cries, by which they expreſs
their oppreſſive ſenſations, they are not
the choſen effects of any inward trouble,
or conflict of mind, (as ordinarily in men)
but ſuch as neceſſarily reſult from thoſe
different figures and alterations of parts,
into which they are naturally and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
caſt, when any offenſive impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are then upon their Bodies. And ſo
they ſeem to import no more, than thoſe
Groans and Sighs, which are obſerved
in men, when they are in no perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mind at all, but are purely natural
acts, conſequent to ſome (ſometimes unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved)
ſtraitnes or oppreſſion in the
inward parts of their Bodies; Or as when
thoſe acts are expreſſed by men in a faſt
ſleep, and their Minds are not in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to conſider them. And it's like, that
Brutes ſuffer no more by ſuch impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon their Senſes, either in Diſeaſes
or hard Uſages, than a Souldier feels ſmart
by his wounds, in the heat and fury of the
Battle, when his mind is not at leiſure to

the Subtilty and Wilineſs of

tricks, and imitation of many humane
actions, for Sport and Divertiſement.</p>
                  <p>To all which it's Anſwered, firſt,
That thoſe mention'd Actions, that
hold ſuch an aſſimulation to thoſe of
Rational Agents, are only ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a natural neceſſary Principle,


<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42467:184"/>
which their Wiſe CREATOUR
implanted in their ſeveral kinds in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
manners, to ſupply the want of
an intellectual Faculty. Therefore <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſius,</hi>
firſt a Philoſopher, and then a
Biſhop, in his Book of the Nature of
Man, obſerves, That in Brute Animals,
<hi>there is an Vnderſtanding that is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. 2. § 7.</note>
                     <hi>but not Rational;</hi> and then gives
a Reaſon for it:<note place="margin">Cap. 2. § 7. num. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>every Creature of one kind, doth the ſame
thing in one and the ſame manner; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Hare uſeth the ſame ſubtilty, every
Fox the ſame wilineſs; and every Ape is
alike, an imitator of Humane Actions:
But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is not in all caſes ſo
with Man; for his Actions of Reaſon, are
infinitely various, and of different ſorts;
in ſeveral individuals; and are variated
by choice and freedom of Mind in the
ſame Perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Secondly, as to thoſe Actions
of Brute Animals, which are called Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
it only proves, That they have
natural Qualifications, that make reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
of Humane Vertues, but they
are by inſtinct and neceſſary, and not
of choice, nor upon any apprehenſion
of doing Right or Good; nor from
the propoſal of any end, as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in any action, that may be call'd


<pb n="319" facs="tcp:42467:184"/>
morally Vertuous, ſuch as muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to be in Rational Beings.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, as for their Dexterities
and Tricks, it's certain, that they are
learn'd, and done, not by any inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or diſcourſive faculty, but by a
greater natural quickneſs and ſagacity
of their Senſes, which fits them for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and mechanical direction, how
to act ſuch things; which at preſent
become as unaccountable, and may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
as much preſent wonder in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators,
as the nimble feats of Jugglers,
becauſe they eſcape the Beholder's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation:
And ſo much as Jugglers are
truly reputed Conjurers, ſo much may
thoſe Brute Animals, for that reaſon, be
as juſtly eſteem'd Rational Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Now upon the whole account of what
I have ſaid in the caſe of Brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
it is ſo different from that of
Mankind, that it can no way be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
How it ſhould be unjuſtifyable in
the Soveraign Creatour, if they ſhould
meet no future Recompence for ſuch
comparatively very inconſiderable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durances.</p>
                  <p>And, if it were granted with <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry</hi>
and others, That they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
in ſome degree, with a Rational
Capacity, yet for as much as they want


<pb n="320" facs="tcp:42467:185"/>
all manner of ſenſe of a Deity, and
are altogether uncapable of morally,
either pleaſing or offending Him; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as they have no Faculties, by
which in their Afflictions they can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dread His Juſtice, implore His Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or make any Complaints to Him;
how can it be ſuppoſed, That they can
have any Capacities, by which they
ſhould either be expectant, or acceptive
of any Rewards or Compenſations from
Him in a Future World?</p>
                  <p>But then as to Man, how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
That he being made a Creature
furniſhed with Faculties, by which he
can make Conceptions of a GOD, that
can own Him for his Creatour, and can
love and ſerve Him, and fear to offend
Him; by which he can complain for
a Relief, and hope for a Redreſs: I ſay,
How is it poſſible, That ſuch a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as this, after all the indurances of
a Calamitous Life, ſhould at laſt be ſo
forgotten and forſaken, as to have his
Being ſhut up in an empty Nothing?
What a Gratification and Pleaſure would
the thought of this be to every rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Enemy of Mankind? And how
would the Adverſaries of Goodneſs and
Good Men rejoice, if they were aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that when Vertuous Perſons, whom


<pb n="321" facs="tcp:42467:185"/>
at preſent they ſcorn, hate, and oppreſs,
were once gone out of the World, they
ſhould not only be in no better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than themſelves, but in no other,
than what their Dogs and Horſes paſs
into when they die?</p>
                  <p>This mighty Objection, in which the
willing Adverſaries of a Future State
placed ſuch a Confidence, being thus
ſolv'd, I hope I have fairly acquitted
my ſelf of the firſt part of my deſign'd
Method, to promote this preſent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
that is, I have endeavour'd to
repreſent, that Man, by the Divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Permiſſion, was created and
born ſubjected and expoſed to bear ſuch
ſevere Portions of Miſery and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that if there be no other uſe and
end of them, but only that they ſhould
be endured, as his ſubjection to them
is ſoveraignly impoſed, and no proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
reſerved in future, whereby he might
enjoy a ſucceeding ſetled State of Reſt,
Freedom, and Compenſation after them,
then muſt Man, (as it was at firſt ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
and ſince proved) be the
only unfortunate Being of the whole
Creation. And that the Exiſtence of
any other Created Being whatſoever
(be it of a Stone, or Plant, Worm,
or Fly) were rather to be choſen, if


<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42467:186"/>
he had a liberty allow'd him of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his Election. But concerning that,
there are ſeverer Thoughts ſtill to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

Conſequences, which every

approve of ſuch an uſe of their Power

That the Soveraignty of GOD
over His Creatures is more abſolute


<pb n="325" facs="tcp:42467:187"/>
than a Prince's or Parent's over his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

That His Divine Goodneſs muſt alſo

demenſions with His Dominion; and
that it is diſhonourable to the Divine
Nature to imagine, That there ſhould
be any act of the one, which ſhould
not be compleatly conſiſtent with the

                  <p>But, againſt the Inference of this
dreadful Conſequence, I muſt encounter
Three grand Objections, pretended for
the vindication of the Divine Attributes
in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It will be objected, That though
GOD Almighty gave Man ſuch a Being,
by which, in ſome reſpects, he may live
a more afflictive Life than other viſible
Creatures; yet nevertheleſs, it's to be
conſider'd, That GOD hath, in compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
allow'd him a far larger ſhare of
many happy Advantages in this World,
by which he may be ſenſible of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more Knowledge, Honour, Power,

beſides can be poſſeſſed of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:42467:188"/>
To this Objection, my Anſwer is,
That whatſoever that Portion be, if there
be no apprehenſion of a future Bliſs, to
make ſuch Enjoyments acceptable in
their eſteem and uſe, it's known, (as my
next and laſt Argument will ſufficiently
explain the Caſe) that whatſoever they
be, they muſt be ſuch as, in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
are neither univerſal, ſatisfactory,
nor certain; nor in any man's power,
at choice, to obtain them, when they
moſt paſſionately deſire them, or moſt
extreamly need them. And when they
are poſſeſſed, they are ſuch, as will be
perpetually incumbring the Minds of
Men, with ſo many fears, and unexpected
turns and interruptions, and with ſo
many attendant Evils, that any one of
them conſider'd, and felt, (as the nature
of Man's mind is) may more afflictive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſault its notice, to the Senſe of its
own Infelicity, than all other the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral
parts of Proſperity can afford it
contentment or ſatisfaction. So that, if
it falls out, (and it's rare if it doth not)
that the moſt proſperous man in all other
reſpects, ſhould be invaded either in
Body or Mind, with any of thoſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Evils, to which his nature hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
him, all other his Enjoyments
(how many and great ſoever) would


<pb n="327" facs="tcp:42467:188"/>
appear not only inconſiderable, but oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
nauſeous to his Thoughts. Firſt,
A Fit of any violent Torment upon his
Body, ſhall render his ſtately Palace, his
plenteous Fortune, and his honourable
Character, ſo unconcerning, as that a
Noble man of this Nation (as I have
been inform'd) ſhould in a continued Fit
of the Gout, wiſh an exchange of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in all thoſe his famous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
with an healthful Porter, rather
than enjoy all other the parts of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
with that one attendant Evil.</p>
                  <p>And then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's the ſame with
any ſuch Perſon, how proſperous ſoever
in all other reſpects, that happens but to
have his Mind affected with any diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
imagination, (how cauſeleſs, perhaps,
or unreaſonable ſoever) as that a great
Lady of this Nation alſo, (as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to me by one that knew her) who
at the ſame time that she was diſcours'd
by her Favourite, to be the happieſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the World, in reſpect of her Youth
and Beauty, Noble Extraction and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
and ſtanding at a Window in view
of a poor Oyſter-woman, then paſſing
by, ſhould be ſo unſenſible of the great
advantages of living happily, which she
enjoy'd, as to ſay, That she could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to exchange her own preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition


<pb n="328" facs="tcp:42467:189"/>
with that Poor womans, at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
whatſoever. No wonder then,
that the Wiſe <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſhould ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
expreſs himſelf in our Caſe, as to
ſay;<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>What is there here
that ſhould tempt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of being any longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in this Life? A
company of poor outward
things, ſo tranſient, ſo apt to change? Shall
ſuch obſcure ſenſes, that are ſo eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?
ſhall a little ſoul, that knows not it
ſelf? ſhall a vain and empty Name and
Glory? What ſhouldſt thou deſire, but a
preſent Annihilation or Tranſition?</hi> And
this (I think) ſufficiently ſolves my firſt
Objection.</p>
                  <p>2. The Second Objection that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to obviate the reflection upon
thoſe Attributes of God, with reſpect to
the aboveſaid humane Infelicities, is thus
laid: That is, That GOD may be ſo
far juſtified in Mankind's ſubjection to
them, as that thoſe Evils are ſuppoſed
to be inflicted upon men as puniſhments
for their offences, and as effects of their
own guilt. That is, That they have
deſerved them at God's Hand.</p>
                  <p>My Anſwer to this ſeemingly great
Objection is, That that kind of Solution
of the conſequence, does rather improve


<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42467:189"/>
the Reflection upon the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
and muſt even blaſpheme the
Goodneſs of GOD it ſelf, upon ſeveral
accounts. Firſt, Becauſe it muſt ſuppoſe,
that GOD deſign'd to puniſh a Man, even
in his Birth; it being an Infelicity in
it ſelf to be ſo born. Secondly, Becauſe
the real miſeries that may attend his
Infancy, Childhood, and the innocenter
part of his Youth, muſt be reputed Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
for Offences uncommitted, and
but only in poſſibility. And then, Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
When ſuch Calamities have befaln
men of fuller Age, they could not be
really accounted Puniſhments, that is
meerly and properly ſo, becauſe they
come to paſs generally in a promiſcuous
order and manner, and in moſt inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
without any viſible diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Good and Evil: And that
Vertuous perſons (who, though they be
not abſolutely perfect, yet perhaps not
wilfully wicked) are alike concern'd in
thoſe natural Evils, and in the ordinary
contingences of Calamity,<note place="margin">Non om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos eſſe beatos, quum in omnes bonos, ea quae ille in malis numerat cadere poſſunt. <hi>Cic. Tuſc. queſt. lib.</hi> 5.</note> as well as the
obnoxious and great Offenders. <hi>Are not
Good men</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cicero) ſurprized. in
common Miſeries as well as the Evil?
Are they not as afflictively ſick, poor,


<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42467:190"/>
and old?</hi> And, do they not paſs
along in their mortal Durations, with
the ſame ſevere circumſtances of natural
Troubles, and ſad Accidents, as other
men? And in many caſes are they not
obſerv'd to meet even harder uſages than
thoſe that be enormouſly vitious? And
if ſo, then (I ſay) Cannot Mankind in
general be ſaid to be ſubject to them,
and afflicted by them, under the meer
notion of Puniſhments? For though Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
may, and doth order them oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the Puniſhment of Evil men,
yet it is to be accounted not by a natural,
but by an occaſional Ordination: That
is, they are Primarily the miſeries of
Mankind, according to their nature, and
then but Secondarily, and by occaſion,
the Puniſhments of Evil men, when they
happen to them. As the ſame Evils and
Miſfortunes may in like manner be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally
and ordinatively the acts of
God's Paternal care and love, and for the
greater Advantage of Good men, when
they happen to them, as thoſe Evils may
be the diſcipline and chaſtiſement of his
Wiſe Love to, and care of, them.</p>
                  <p>But then the Reaſon of all this muſt
be founded upon the ſuppos'd Exiſtence
of a Future World. Otherwiſe it would
be a great irregularity in Providence, if


<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42467:190"/>
innocent Infants and Children, and that
men of perfect age, who endeavour all
they can to be Good and Vertuous, ſhould
nevertheleſs be made miſerable, &amp; be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the ſame manner, and to the ſame
degree that wicked and vitious men are
puniſhed for their groſs offences. Which
muſt be True in conſequence, if (I ſay)
the conſideration of a Future World doth
not ſolve the doubt.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall reſpite the giving a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Evidence for that Solution, to the
Third Chapter. This the Second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. The Third Objection which
our Theiſt doth chuſe to lay in our
way, is borrowed from ſome of the
Chriſtian Name, (and it muſt be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
anſwered) 1. Who have been
apt to affirm, That though it can't be
ſaid, that Man's ſubjection to thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
and natural calamities, were impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon Mankind univerſally for their
own offences, yet God may be juſtify'd
in permitting, if not in inflicting them
(without any conſideration had to a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State) for the imputed ſin of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that is, becauſe that every man
is born guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſions,
and by that guilt alone, every man
may be juſtifyably born ſubject to the


<pb n="332" facs="tcp:42467:191"/>
unhappineſs of all thoſe mention'd Evils.</p>
                  <p>To all this objection; Firſt I ſay, That
our Church indeed in her confeſſion,<note place="margin">Art. 9.</note> doth
profeſs, That <hi>Original Sin is the fault and
corruption of every Man, that is Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engendred of the Offſpring of Adam,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>And that therefore in every Perſon born
into the World, it deſerveth God's Wrath
and Damnation.</hi> In which laſt words of
the Article, as it's ſevereſt conſequence,
my Objecters may interpret, that mans
natural ſubjection to thoſe mention'd
Evils is comprehended and underſtood;
though the Article takes not any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
notice of that conſequence of <hi>Adam's</hi>
Sin.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Article indeed
doth ſuppoſe it in expreſs
words:<note place="margin">Si quis Adae praevaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem ſibi ſoli, &amp; non ejus propagini—mortem &amp; poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas corporis tantum,—&amp;c. <hi>Caranza</hi> p. 910.</note> And the <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Confeſſion doth enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate
thoſe very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
calamities, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
as I have done; as being compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in that menace, <hi>The day thou Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
thereof thou ſhalt ſurely Die.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in full Anſwer to the Objection,
I ſay that the Article is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
improvable to take off the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
of that intolerable conſequence,
which ſo much reflects upon the Divine
Attributes, upon the account of Mans


<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42467:191"/>
natural ſubjection to all thoſe Evils; that,
were it not for the conſideration and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of a Future State, it will appear,
that the Senſe of it cannot poſſibly be
conſiſtent or accountable. For whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
imputation of guilt is preſum'd by
it to be derived from <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin to his
Poſterity, certainly God never deſign'd
thereby to be ſo unmerciful, as natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to puniſh any man ſo ſeverely for it,
who ſhould not afterward deſerve it by his
own offences, as that it may be believed,
that God did but take occaſion by the
imputation to put Mankind under a new,<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 16, 17, 18.</note>
and a more gracious Covenant, for high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and nobler Intereſts, and upon eaſier,
and more feiſible Terms; for the better
performance of which, mans natural and
contingent Evils were to become deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
inſtrumental, and highly ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
otherwiſe it would argue ſuch an
act of Revenge, as can hardly be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd
by the worſt imaginary caſe; and
that in an inſtance, that God hath moſt
ſolemnly diſclaim'd, as when he ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
reproved the uſe of that reflecting
Proverb;<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>The Fathers have eaten ſowre
Grapes, and the Childrens Teeth are ſet
on edge.</hi> Thereupon he renounc'd all
manner of partiality in the execution of
his Divine Judgment, and poſitively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd


<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42467:192"/>
the equality of his own ways, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Fundamental of Eternal Equity;
that is,<note place="margin">v. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Son ſhall not bear the
Iniquity of the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for that inſtance which hath been
made uſe of to juſtify God in the preſent
Miſeries, and even in the Eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the greater part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
for <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin, becauſe the Sons of
Traytors may be puniſhed for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Offences, it holds no reſemblance
at all to this Caſe; for that's done, not that
the Government doth not know, that
there is an hard thing done to an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and unfortunate Heir, but out of
pure politick neceſſity, to diſcourage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
from attempting the like Treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deſigns to their own, their Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the Governments Ruin. Now
this caſe is altogether different from the
other; for here is only the puniſhment
of one or a few, to prevent the undoing
a numerous Many, and for a Publick Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
But there muſt be ſuppos'd ſuch an
imputation of one mans fault, as muſt
put the whole world into a ſtate of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
without any conſideration had to
their own offences. A belief of ſuch a
proceedure cannot poſſibly conſiſt with
the very Notion of a Supream Deity,
without Reaſons that might be given for


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:42467:192"/>
ſuch a Fact, from the conſideration of
mans deſignation to the happineſs of a
Future World; as for the better attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which, all humane miſeries may
be made ſubſervient, as ſhall preſently
appear.</p>
                  <p>And thus notwithſtanding the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though the truth of the Article be
aſſented to; yet it cannot take off the
intolerable conſequence upon the Divine
Attributes, without a reſpect had to the
Exiſtence of another World. This the
laſt Objection.</p>
                  <p>But there be other ſevere conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of another Nature, which muſt be
alſo conſidered, but they are the buſineſs
of the next, or Second Section.</p>

that concern GOD Almighty, which
are of themſelves really deſtructive to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

                  <p>The firſt Conſequence of that nature,

                  <p>Secondly, On that account it would
be true, That in caſes of violent Torments

                  <p>The laſt Conſequence (as that which

is, That in a Thouſand Caſes it would

On this account, What can be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently

that he made his own Sword his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve,

With many more Examples of that ſort
of men, whoſe Stoiciſm having afforded
them an Allowance, it was but reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Unhappy.</p>
                  <p>And what Kindneſs theſe men did
themſelves, for ought I yet ſee, (if there
be no Future State, nor Laws to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
mens actions in order to it) my
Friend, when he ſees me in ſorrow or
torment, might as innocently do it for
me, as to kill a Fly, and with far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reaſon; and to whom I might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal

and it's the moſt famouſly
conſiderable of them all. And therefore,


<pb n="339" facs="tcp:42467:194"/>
againſt it, I muſt be attacked with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Objections, which will take up the
next Section.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>Section III.</head>
                  <p>IN this Third Section, I ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the Anſwer of Three Objections,
againſt the juſt Inference of this laſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Conſequence; that is, of mens taking
a Liberty to put an end to their own
Lives, as oft as they find themſelves op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with thoſe Calamities, to which
their natures have ſubjected them.</p>
                  <p>1. The Firſt Objection is, That Men
may be reſtrained from ſuch deſtructive
Attempts upon their own Lives, by a
natural fear of, and a cuſtomary abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
from Dying; though they had no
Faith at all of another World.</p>
                  <p>2. The Second is founded upon an
Obſervation, That perſons who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
renounce the Belief of another
World, do not ordinarily, and but very
rarely, make uſe of that Expedient, to
free themſelves from their own afflictive
ſtates.</p>
                  <p>3. The Third Objection is, That the
Heathen Philoſophers have allow'd the


<pb n="340" facs="tcp:42467:195"/>
World a notice of ſome Wiſe Rules, by
which it's preſum'd, that men may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly
bear their natural and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Evils, without doing that violence
to their own Lives, and alſo without any
neceſſary conſideration had of a future
World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. The Firſt Objection is, That
a deſire of Living and ſelf-preſervation,
is as connatural to Men, as their very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and that it is in ſome Sence true,
what Satan ſaid,<note place="margin">Job 2. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Skin for ſkin, and all that
a man hath, will he give for his Life.</hi> And
therefore ſuch an innate and (eſpecially
being made a) cuſtomary deſire of Life,
will be ſufficient to hold mens hands
from offering that confuſion to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
of Mankind, upon every man's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Liberty to die, as oft as he is
oppreſſed with any croſs or calamity.
And, ſo that there needs not any acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of a Future State, to prevent
that grand inconvenience to the World.</p>
                  <p>To this I Anſwer, That though it be
granted, that there is ſuch a natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of Self-preſervation, and that it be
moreover allowed, that that deſire is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
advanced by a cuſtomary fear
of Dying; yet if it be reaſonable in it
ſelf, becauſe it is far eaſier to paſs out of
the World with a gentle ſtroke, but of


<pb n="341" facs="tcp:42467:195"/>
one minute's duration, than to endure a
long languiſhing Diſease, or a tormenting
Pain, or a permanent Oppreſſion of Mind,
(there being no fear of a following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
for the irregularity of the Fact)
it's all I pretend to in this conſideration.
For what is purely reaſonable in its ſelf,
may in time conquer a natural, ſenſual,
and imaginary fear, and the power of
cuſtom; and ſubdue the common cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of mens diſapprobation of the
Fact, and at laſt, by common uſage, give
Laws to the World, and a Reputation to
the Deſign: As it hath done among the
<hi>Indian</hi> Women, who cheerfully, in the
briſkeſt vigour of their Age, throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into their dead Huſbands Funeral
flames, to prevent a following accuſtom'd
diſhonour to themſelves: And as it is
among the <hi>Japaneſſes,</hi> who cuſtomarily
rip up their own Entrals, rather than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
the diſgrace of being reſpitted,
till the Executioner ſhall do his Office.
Thus is the firſt Objection ſolv'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The next Objection is, That
if becauſe, where there's no concern for a
Future State, it will follow, that ſuch an
Expedient to ſet a miſerable Perſon free
from his preſent want, torment, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
would be a reaſonable attempt (as
I have diſcours'd): If this were True


<pb n="342" facs="tcp:42467:196"/>
(ſaith my Objector) How comes it to
paſs, that that irreligious ſort of men;
who do profeſſedly mock at the belief
of another World, ſhould not very often,
if not alwaies, act that kind piece of
Friendſhip to themſelves, when they
happen to be greatly Unfortunate?</p>
                  <p>To which I Anſwer, that I confeſs
there is ſuch a ſort of men in the World,
that do make a ſcorn of all Religion,
and a Future Life; and that would be
thought ſufficiently able to defend the
Caſe, when once they have pick'd up two
or three notable exceptions againſt the
Holy Bible, and can croſs ſome Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Principles of Chriſtianity, with a
few hints of the <hi>Malmſburian</hi> Divinity;
or when they can get no better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to perſwade their lewd Crew to
comply with them in the ſame contempt
of God, and of all that is Sacred and Good;
they can think it at preſent a ſufficient
confutation of all that can be ſaid in their
own defence, if they do but ſwear down
the man in Black, with a thouſand Oaths
and Curſes, and with Unmanlineſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
can but droll upon him with ſome
idle ſtories, purpoſely ſet on foot, to make
themſelves merry, with the defamation
of the whole Sacred Order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:42467:196"/>
But in the mean time theſe men give
us no ſufficient Reaſon to think, that
they are ſincere, and truly in earneſt at
the bottom in all this: For if they did
but really believe, that there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, as they ſwear and pretend,
it were Impoſſible that they ſhould be ſo
dull and ſilly as to chuſe to be unhappy
any one hour more; but that, when they
are oppreſſed with want of money, with
a baffl'd Amour, or loſs of health, or
when they are rotten, and creep about
the town with half a Noſe, or with other
the like ſymptoms of their own debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries,
they ſhould determine their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
at one blow; and prudently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themſelves to reſt in a quiet annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
which they knew they might ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
with ſo much eaſe and ſpeed. If
ſome of them would but briſkly go about
that work, they might gain a belief from
us, that they meant what they ſaid;
otherwiſe they muſt excuſe us, if we
think, that they either are a pack of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
cowards; (of which their
bluſtering humour is a very probable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication)
or elſe that they have ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
doubts of the Exiſtence of another
World creeping about their minds, that
hinders the Rope, or ſome good old Well,
from doing them a kinder Office, than


<pb n="344" facs="tcp:42467:197"/>
the beſt friends they have in the world
can otherwiſe do for them; if it were
true, as they pretend, that there is no
Future World, account, or puniſhment.
But then the wonder is, that if that doubt,
can, on the one hand, reſtrain them from
an act ſo much to their preſent eaſe and
deliverance; and yet that the ſame doubt,
ſhould not on the other hand, reclaim
them from doing the moſt unreaſonable
thing in the World, that is, from living
ſuch infamous and prodigiouſly wicked
Lives ſo much to their own danger of
being eternally undone, if (as they doubt)
there ſhould happen to be ſuch a thing
indeed, as a following and dreadful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in another World.</p>
                  <p>But that I may throughly ſolve theſe
mens Credit, I had rather tell the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecter,
That I am perſwaded, that after
all this, moſt of them do really believe
the being of a God, and of another World;
and they do in their beſt thoughts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
a Vertuous and Sober Life, only
they are reſolved to keep up their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical
and Hectouring humour, to ſhew
their bravery in being Wicked: That is,
they ſpeak and act ſuch extremities of
profaneneſs, that they may be admir'd
for a more than ordinary Greatneſs of
Mind, and ſo may inſult over thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle


<pb n="345" facs="tcp:42467:197"/>
Sinners, that chuſe to creep to Hell,
for a company of Low and Sneaking
Tranſgreſſions.</p>
                  <p>And then, they having paſt away a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
part of their time in that wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
manner of Living, upon this and the
like faſhionable motives; they are at laſt
arreſted with the fatal ſymptoms of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying
and a dying State; and then they
begin to whine for their own Follies, and
admoniſh their ſurviving Friends, of taking
wiſer meaſures, and of making better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
for themſelves in another World.
This ſolves my Second Objection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3d.</hi> The Third and laſt Objection,
which I muſt encounter, is offer'd by
them that will ſay, that Philoſophy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
can ſuggeſt a ſufficient relief to a
mind under the ſevereſt preſſures of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or contingent Evils, as without ſuch
mens undertaking their deliverance, by
putting a preſent period to their own
uneaſy lives, ſo without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Future World as ſufficient to
prevent it.</p>
                  <p>To this it's firſt Anſwer'd, That upon the
carefulleſt ſurvey of <hi>Cicero's</hi> Arguments;
(who I believe hath ſaid as much, and as
wiſely, as can well be ſuggeſted in that
Caſe) I find nothing that he offers that ſo
much as pretends to any exemption from


<pb n="346" facs="tcp:42467:198"/>
thoſe natural Miſeries, much leſs that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
any thing in compenſation for
them; only he hath given ſome certain
Rules, which (as it's preſum'd) may direct
men how better to ſubmit to, and the
more patiently to bear up againſt, their
preſent miſfortunes; that is, to be more
wiſely miſerable: But nevertheleſs, the
afflicted man endures them ſtill; that is,
notwithſtanding all thoſe Rules, he is
ſtill an unhappy man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, that all thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective
Rules they give are a relief and cure
by far narrower than the largeneſs of the
diſtemper; that is, they are too Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
for the hundredth part of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteds
capacities, to learn or underſtand
them: And they generally purport juſt
ſo much help to the miſerable, as if all
men that want Money, were ſent to the
Philoſophers Stone, to cure the diſeaſe
of their Purſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> My Anſwer to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is, That I obſerve our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
makes the ſuccesfulneſs of thoſe
his Rules,<note place="margin">—Sic contra, illi ſunt beati, quos nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Metus terrènt, nullae Libidines incitant, <hi>&amp;c. Tuſc. Quest. lib.</hi> 5.</note> to depend upon ſuch ſevere
qualifications of Mind and Life, and
upon ſo many ſtrict acts of ſelf-denial,
<hi>(ſuch as throwing off all natural Fear, and


<pb n="347" facs="tcp:42467:198"/>
the force of all ſenſual Appetites,</hi> and the
like) that the afflicted Perſons may be
order'd to go about almoſt to unman
themſelves, as well as pretend an Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to all his numerous and difficult
preſcriptions; which nothing but the
Encouragements of a Future World can
poſſibly inable them to undertake; as
my Third Argument hath evinced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I Anſwer, That thoſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
did ſo far believe their own
notional Schemes of Patience to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
(and as a full confutation of
all other their pretentions for the relief
of the unfortunate) that at laſt they
were driven to fly to the Rock of Fatal
Neceſſity,<note place="margin">Quid er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ationes, procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> que, quo perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſi immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia ſunt Fata?

                     </note> to give any tolerable quiet to
mens uneaſy Minds. This <hi>Seneca</hi> pleads
as the laſt refuge, and the only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
comfort for a Sick Mind; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, all other attempts for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
were altogether unſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Now, if ever any manner of carriage
could intimate a defective cauſe, This
certainly muſt do it, as to our preſent
concern; if there be no other, or no better
ſhifts, to avert the cogency of our thus


<pb n="348" facs="tcp:42467:199"/>
arguing for a Future World, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of mens natural ſubjection to
ſuch miſeries and calamities of humane
Life, the Controverſie is at an end.</p>
                  <p>What! Is there no other way to ſolve
the Reflection upon the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
and to keep a Man from offering
Violence to his own miſerable Life, but
by engaging him to think, that he muſt
of neceſſity be Unhappy, and that an
immoveable Fate hath chain'd him down
to it? What can be added more to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
his miſery? The leaſt hopes of
Deliverance hath ſome Relief; but where
there is none at all to be admitted, an
Invitation to Patience is an additional
oppreſſion, and looks more like a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful
Exprobration, than a rational
Support.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Fifthly</hi> and Laſtly, To ſhew how
thoſe men are neceſſitated to trifle in
finding out a Relief for the Afflicted's
Patience, (where the Concerns of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World are deſignedly to be laid aſide)
it may be obſerv'd, That the great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
were ſo diffident of their own
ſtated Rules, eſpecially of their beloved
Principle of Fate, that they themſelves
have diſpoil'd the Credit of them, and
proclaim'd them all to be inſufficient, by
allowing a ſpeedier Remedy for all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane


<pb n="349" facs="tcp:42467:199"/>
Miſeries; and, that is, by acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themſelves of their Miſfortunes and
Beings all at once. Concerning this, I
have already given ſome inſtances, and
could have added many more great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of that deſperate Expedient;
which thoſe Philoſophers mention with
ſo much approbation, that <hi>Seneca</hi> taking
occaſion to ſpeak of <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Scipio;</hi>
of the later,<note place="margin">Multum fuit Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem vincere, ſed amplius mortem. <hi>Ep. lib. 3. Ep.</hi> 34.</note> he hath this
expreſſion; that <hi>It was a
great thing that it could be
ſaid of him, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered</hi>
Carthage; <hi>but much greater, that
he had overcome himſelf; that is, ended his
Life with his own Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then, Do not the reaſon of the ſad
mention'd intolerable conſequence recurr?
Doth not what I have here ſaid ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſhew, that what I before af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
was true; that is, that it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
follow, that if there be no Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State conſider'd, it's reaſonable for a
man to put an end to his own Life and
Miſery together? Or, Why ſhould ſuch
men (in whom this laſt Objection had
its Concern) ſo often chuſe to make uſe
of that Expedient, and in a Thouſand
Caſes think it more reaſonable to put an
end to their wearied Lives, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
their preſent Miſeries? This ſolves
my Laſt Objection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:42467:200"/>
And thus all my Opponents are diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of their Deſign to baffle the
reaſonableneſs of all my intolerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences:
Which muſt hold immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
true, till the acknowledged Exiſtence
of a future State ſhall releaſe them of
their horrour, and allow them a ſufficient
Solution; which is the buſineſs of the
Third and Laſt Chapter of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Therefore,</p>

               <p>THis Third Chapter is deſign'd to

without all Exception, ſolve all thoſe
mention'd intolerable Conſequences, to
the immortal Honour of the Great CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR,
who was pleaſed to creat Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in ſuch circumſtances: And to the
full ſatisfaction of every Good man, that
conſiders himſelf to be ſo created. And
this I ſhall endeavour to do, in two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Sections.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">

                  <head>Section I.</head>
                  <p>IN this Firſt Section, I ſhall repreſent,
That the Belief of a Future ſtate, will
moſt evidently ſolve all thoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
that reflect upon the Honour of
the Divine Attributes: And that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
hath been ſuggeſted to diſparage
GOD's Goodneſs and Equity on the
former account, will now be found to
be falſly concluding, and that ought to
be renounc'd as unreaſonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious;
when the Gracious Intention and
Wiſe Deſigns, why GOD made Man
naturally ſubject to all thoſe temporary
Infelicities, be but once throughly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and ſeriouſly conſidered. For
then it will appear, That GOD made
Man ſubject to ſuch ſevere circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a preſent mortal Unhappineſs, for
no leſs end, than to ſerve His own moſt
Gracious Purpoſes of making him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
and eternally Happy in another
World.</p>
                  <p>Had not GOD made him a Rational
Creature, he had not been capable of
underſtanding his Duty, and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of an End to oblige him to it;
and had alſo wanted a faculty of being


<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42467:201"/>
receptive of any Bleſſing upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it: Had not Man been made
a voluntary Agent, he had been uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in all moral actions, and so unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Rewards and Puniſhments: And
had he not been born ſubject to thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Evils, he had wanted the beſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of a Probationary ſtate; that is, he
had wanted occaſions for the choice and
exerciſe of moſt of thoſe Graces and
Vertuous Actions, that were requiſite to
make him Good, and to keep him cloſe
to his Hope, and to his dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
GOD.</p>
                  <p>And, if the worſt Evils he encounters
be improved to thoſe excellent ends,
(which all men that love and fear God,
muſt believe they ſhould) they will ſoon
be experimentally found to be inſtances
of God's favourable Ordination and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and to be not only tolerable,
but highly reaſonable and approveable in
their kind and nature. And not only ſo,
but the afflicted man may in time find
Reaſons (which he can never want, if
he ſtudies for them) ſo to attemper his
mind, that he may be as thankful for
them, as for any other of God's Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Contrivements, to further his Good
and Happineſs. And on that account, he
may as reaſonably be able to rejoice for


<pb n="353" facs="tcp:42467:201"/>
a fit of trouble, as for a hit of Preferment;
for a Portion of Contempt, as for the
refreſhment of a Meal; for the Wicked
man's oppreſſive Malice, as for the kind
effects of an affectionate Friendſhip; and
for a day of ſevere perſecution in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
caſe, more than for a ſucceſsful
Conqueſt over his moſt imperious and
implacable Enemies.</p>
                  <p>Are they poor? <hi>(ſaith</hi> Salvian, <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>How many pious men are there in

nor willingly have renounced
their Portion in other humane Evils, when
Experience hath once aſcertain'd them,


<pb n="354" facs="tcp:42467:202"/>
how much they have all ſenſibly proved
advantageous Inſtruments, and Occaſions
of their more intire love of, and adherence
to GOD and Vertue; and of their keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>And then further, How many ſuch

Follies; and found time to recollect the
happy iſſues of their own Experience;
and (what is more) are improving the
Advantages of their natural timely War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for their following Change? And,
that every day, as they more and more
decline, they are more and more
ſtrengthened in their ſatisfaction and
contentment upon the preſent repaſts,
and lively hope and apprehenſions of
their near approaching tranſmigration to

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:42467:202"/>
miſerable, yet upon the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Happineſs of a Future State,
it ought to be eſteemed happy and ſafe;
<hi>as St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>diſcourſeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then, let it be further obſerved,
and that very conſiderably to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
That God is ſo far juſtified in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and permitting Man's ſubjection to
ſuch Evils and Infelicities, (as I have
repreſented them) in the Sence of them
that have firmly believed, and that then,
upon that Belief (which is unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
unreaſonable, if they do not) are
providing for the Bleſſed Intereſt of ſuch
a Future World; as that ſome of them
have not thought their ordinarily inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and natural Evils great and many
enough, to ſecure their Vertue and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
but in imitation of God's own
natural order and method for their Good,
have voluntarily contrived more to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
when their Piety and Prudence
have thought it needful.</p>
                  <p>And this may be juſtifiably verified,
from the innumerous Primitive Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Mortification; when the Saints
of God have choſen ſevere Faſtings, and
a conſtant hard Diet; afflictive Labours,
and weariſom Imployments; tedious
Devotions, and the incredible Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of (the ſo much admired) Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral


<pb n="356" facs="tcp:42467:203"/>
Greatneſs, Splendor, and Pleaſures
of the World; that they might with
leſſer hazard attain the great end of a
Future Bliſs.</p>
                  <p>And, Laſtly, For a further juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Divine Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the caſe of humane afflictions,
the conſideration of a Future World
will ſolve one great doubt and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And that is, If any man ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a Reaſon, Why GOD is pleaſed
that ſome men ſhall meet a greater Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of preſent Miſery than others, (as
at all times, by many inſtances, it may
be pregnantly obſerved and verified)
and that one perſon's Life ſhould be very
calamitous, while anothers is but tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
uneaſie: That ſome men ſhould but
taſte of the Waters of Affliction, while
others are plunged ſo deep in them,<note place="margin">Pſal. 69. 2.</note>
that the Floods run over them: That is,
That ſome ſhould meet but with Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
while others are neceſſitated to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with Extremities. And then, if
ſuch extraordinarily afflicted People
ſhould ſorrowfully bewail their ſurpluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of Diſcipline, comparatively to moſt
other Examples of Miſery; and ſhould
be tempted to call in queſtion the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
of God's Goodneſs and Equity, to,
and over them, the Belief of the real


<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42467:203"/>
Exiſtence of a future ſtate, ſolves all this
great difficulty alſo, (which nothing
elſe can poſſibly effect, to the CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOUR's
honour, and Man's ſatisfaction)
and makes ſuch an unequal diſtribution
of preſent Troubles and Afflictions, as
reaſonable and juſtifiable as any other
the wiſe effects of God's Love, and His
Gracious Providence, for their eternal
Good, on theſe Two Grounds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Such extraordinarily afflicted
Perſons may, and ought to tell their own
minds, that ſuch unuſual degrees and
meaſures of calamity, may be more
ſpecially neceſſary for them in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
capacities, than for other men;
and that GOD ſaw they needed the
ſeverer methods of His Diſcipline, and
correcting Love, more than others.</hi> Had
I had but a tolerable Plenty, <hi>(ſaith one
under the moſt oppreſſive Poverty)</hi> I had
been much worſe than any man that enjoys
the largeſt proportions of Wealth. Had I
been Poſſeſſor of the leaſt degree of that
man's Honour, <hi>(ſaith another, labouring
under the burden of the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and contempt)</hi> I ſhould never have
manag'd it with the ſame Modeſty and
Vnconcernedneſs that he hath done. A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
was ſufficient to make another Good,
but a preſſure is hardly enough for me:


<pb n="358" facs="tcp:42467:204"/>
An ordinary Diſcipline keeps this Man
in order, but GOD thought fit to hedge
up my way with Thorns,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.</note> to reſtrain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in my ungovernable Temper. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Doſe ſecures another man's Health, but
a whole courſe of Phyſick is handly enough
for me.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth the devout Soul eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the different diſproportions of the
afflictive Evils of humane Life; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
of the ſeveral of them, that they
are Arguments of God's greater love,
and more eſpecial care over his Soul;
and renders his own Hope thereby the
more reaſonably applicable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of his own Mind.</p>
                  <p>But then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> He may alſo as
reaſonably inform his Mind, that where
there is ſuch a redundancy of Troubles,
the man that is afflicted with them, may,
and ought alſo to his mighty comfort,
believe, that as God's waies are alwaies
deſignedly Good and Equal, ſo that He
might ſend them upon a deſign, and on
purpoſe to allow him a greater degree
of Happineſs in a better ſtate, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
proportionable to his greater
afflictions in another World. And for
which he may as aſſuredly hope, as that he
that hath improved his Talent in acting
greater meaſures of Good, than others may


<pb n="359" facs="tcp:42467:204"/>
on that account, believe himſelf to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably
then rewarded. For as no one
drop of cold Water in a cup of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſhall not be unrewarded in the one
caſe, ſo ſhall not one Tear that is ſhed
in ſorrow for greater afflictions,<note place="margin">Pſal. 56. 8.</note> be unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed
in the other.</p>
                  <p>And if all men were ſenſible, how va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
any advance of happineſs were in
a State of Glory, they could not but
think, that whereinſoever they have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
themſelves, from doing all the good
they can poſſibly do, they have acted
very imprudently for their own intereſt;
ſo if the men that meet more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
afflictions in this world, did but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the abundancy of their recompence
in another; they would be ſo far from
murmuring at their greater misfortunes,
that they would (as our Saviour in one
inſtant caſe repreſented it) on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 12, 13.</note>
rejoice and be exceeding glad, for
their greater reward in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Now, as to the whole that I have ſaid
in this Caſe, as it will eaſily appear upon
the belief of a Future State, that is was
GOD's Gracious Deſign to make the
enjoyment of a happineſs in it, the Great
End of Mans Creation; ſo alſo, that thoſe
mention'd Evils, to which his nature hath
ſubjected him, may be improved into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny


<pb n="360" facs="tcp:42467:205"/>
inſtrumental advantages, to prepare
and adapt him for it.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, Mankind ought to be
ſo far from making any unkind reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the Juſtice and Equity of GOD,
for their natural ſubjections to all thoſe
Evils and preſent Infelicities, that they
muſt juſtify, and applaud his Wiſdom and
Goodneſs, that he order'd them for ſuch
excellent Ends and Purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>And now, I ſhall once more call for the
Obſerver of the formention'd Rooms of
the calamitous of all ſorts, but it is upon
a new Errand; that is, not that he ſhould
ſtand ſtill as a witneſſing ſpectatour only
of their Miſeries, but that upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
which I have given, he may paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
judgment upon the place; That is,
that now he may not think thoſe Rooms to
be nothing elſe, but ſo many Apartments
of Miſery; but to be either ſo many Divine
Laboratories, in which God deſign'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
the Souls of men, and to prepare them
for the purer Regions of a Future Bliſs; or
he may judge them to be ſo many Sacred
Oratories, in which all the oppreſſed may
(according to GOD's Ordinative love to
them) be more ſtrongly oblig'd to be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
adoring Him, and performing their
conſtant Offices to implore His Bleſſing
upon their ſeveral afflicted States: or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,


<pb n="361" facs="tcp:42467:205"/>
he may look upon them as ſo many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Theatres, in which, the Afflicted
may with religious courage, be contending
for the lofty Prize, that God hath ſet in
their proſpect, by Faith and Hope.</p>
                  <p>And thus, I hope, I have ſo fully ſolv'd
the Firſt intolerable Conſequence, that
they, that ſhall hereafter complain of God
for their ſubjection to their preſent Evils,
muſt arraign his Love for doing them
good, and reproach his Care in carrying
on a deſign for the better ſecuring their
Future Happineſs. And thus ends the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of what might reflect upon the
Creatours Honour.</p>

Firſt, what was alledged concerning Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
cruelty, in propagating Beings to
be ſubject to the poſſibility and danger
of ſo much wretchedneſs and calamity,
is preſently ſolv'd, by a belief of ſuch a
Future State: For Parents can then on
that Ground, moſt reaſonably propound
to their own thoughts and hopes, that
they ſhall bring forth ſo many Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
for an everlaſting happineſs, and
ſo many Rightful Heirs of a moſt Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Inheritance; &amp; that as ſo ſecurely ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon every one of them, that no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Malice, or Contrivance whatſoever,
can diſſeize them of it, unleſs they ſhall
willfully reſign up their own Right, and
Title to it.</p>
                  <p>So that if they ſhould certainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know,
that thoſe their Children ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
meet the hardeſt circumſtances
of humane life; yet conſidering, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
have ſo much reaſon to believe,
that the moſt afflictive Evils of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
are poſſibly improveable for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſecuring a Happy State in another
World; it will be ſufficient to remove
the diſcouragement, which the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
conſequence ſuggeſted to them.
For upon a ſuppoſed tender of election,
a good Parent would in no ſence have
his Children Great and Proſperous, if


<pb n="363" facs="tcp:42467:206"/>
it ſtood in competition with his choice
of having them Good and Vertuous,
though they were aſſured, that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were to be incumber'd with the
greateſt misfortunes, to which their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have ſubjected them.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to what hath been
diſcours'd to juſtify mens putting a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
period to their own uneaſy lives,
when they are heavily oppreſſed, with
any of thoſe ſevereſt Evils of their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
though that practice would be
reaſonable enough, if there were no Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
World (as I have ſhewn Reaſons,
Authorities, and Examples of it); yet
that State being once acknowledg'd and
believed, and the men that do believe it,
actually ingage in the practice of thoſe
Vertuous Actions, that neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the happineſs of it, they would
then, not only hold their hands from ſuch
deſtructive attempts, but rather might
find ſufficient Reaſons to own the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of their lives, as a Bleſſing in
any condition.</p>
                  <p>They would then be patiently and
wiſely accounting with themſelves, That
Almighty GOD may be mercifully
pleas'd to continue them ſtill in their
uneaſy Lives, becauſe (perhaps) ſome
part of the neceſſary work of their great


<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42467:207"/>
ſalvation, is yet unfiniſh'd; that is, that
poſſibly they may have ſome portions of
their loſt time to redeem ſome Remains
of their Paſſions ſtill to ſubdue; ſome
further Additions to be made to their
Heavenly Stock; ſome Defects in their
daily Offices to be amended; or ſome
further Degrees of Love and Zeal for
GOD, and Goodneſs to attain to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they die: Or they may be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
themſelves, by telling their own
minds, That GOD in Mercy to the
World, may let them ſtill live to be
further Inſtrumental to ſome Common
Good. Perhaps ſome diſtreſſed Families
and Perſons would want their ſupport,
or the careleſs Congregations, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<hi>Amens;</hi> or (perhaps) the Church
cannot yet ſpare any part of Her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and that if they were gone, there
might be wanting ſome of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that uphold a ſinful State.</p>
                  <p>In a word, as ſuch Men can never
want Reaſons to judge honourably of
GOD for their continuance in their
mortal, though afflicted Lives, ſo they
would not forgive themſelves a thought
of the leaſt inconvenient uſage of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that might ſhorten their uneaſy
Abode in their preſent Circumſtances,
whatſoever they are. And this is the


<pb n="365" facs="tcp:42467:207"/>
laſt inſtance of ſolution of the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
intolerable Conſequences.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee with what unconſtraint,
and unexceptionable coincidency; and
how without any pretence of force or
oppoſition, they are all ſolv'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd.
And now what can we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
ſhould offer the leaſt Doubt
or ſuſpicion, but that the ſolution of
theſe intolerable Conſequences, ſhould
as naturally, and as it were of courſe,
inferr the Truth of the deſign'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion;
eſpecially, when we ſee all
things do cohere with the ſame fitneſs
and agreeableneſs to it, as a diſlocated
Bone falls into the ſame place, whence
it was diſtorted, to the Patient's preſent
Eaſe; or, as the ſcattered Materials of
a Structure, when they are once fitted
for a regular Frame, are preſently put
together, and accommodated to thoſe
Places and Poſitions, for which they
were at firſt wrought and deſign'd?
So eaſily, and ſo naturally, do all
thoſe conſequences admit their ſolutions,
from the acknowledg'd belief of a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p>THE Fifth Argument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the neceſſary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of a Future State,
is founded upon an Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
That Mankind are naturally
born qualifi'd with the moſt earneſt
Deſires, and the moſt conſtantly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuning
Appetites of being happy:
and yet, that there is nothing offered
or allowed them as attainable or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in this preſent World, by which
thoſe natural Deſires and Appetites
can poſſibly be determined or ſatisfied;
ſo that, if the duration of their whole
Beings ſhould be limited only to their
preſent Mortal Lives, it cannot but
reflect upon the Honour of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour's</hi>


                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:42467:210"/>
Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Goodneſs;
Who, by His own Soveraign Will and
Pleaſure, gave Man a Nature quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with ſuch Deſires and Appetites,
and yet placed him in a World, in which
there is nothing to be had, that can
give any ſufficient ſatisfaction to his
own mind; the proper Seat, in which
all true Happineſs muſt neceſſarily be
preſum'd to reſide. And becauſe the
ſuppoſal of the Real Exiſtence of a
Future World, in which <hi>GOD</hi> may
have provided ſuch Enjoyments, as may
naturally and ſufficiently ſatisfy thoſe
reſtleſs Deſires and Appetites of being
Happy, can be the only poſſible ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Reflexion upon thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Attributes of <hi>GOD,</hi> it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follows, That GOD Almighty
hath constituted ſuch a Future World.</p>
               <p>But that this Argument thus gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

I ſhall order the full Explanation


<pb n="371" facs="tcp:42467:210"/>
of all the parts of it in theſe Three
Chapters.</p>
               <p>1. In the First Chapter, I ſhall
repreſent, That <hi>GOD</hi> hath certainly
created all men with thoſe ſtrong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and predominant Appetites of their
own Happineſs; and that it is not in
their own Power, when they pleaſe to
lay them aſide, or ſufficiently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
them for their own eaſe: and then,
that it cannot be doubted, but that
<hi>GOD</hi> Almighty in His equitable
Kindneſs, and eſſential Goodneſs, hath
one where or other, made Proviſion for
their Reſt, and Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>In the Second Chapter, I ſhall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
evince, That there is nothing
allowed to Mankind, as attainable in
their preſent mortal Lives, but what is
unſufficient to make them truly Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py;
or to give any conſtant, or indeed,
any tolerable Acquieſcence to their own
reſtleſly deſiring Minds.</p>
               <p>In the Third Chapter, I ſhall tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly


<pb n="372" facs="tcp:42467:211"/>
demonſtrate, That the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
of the real Exiſtence of a Future
World, and of a ſufficient Happineſs
there attainable, will naturally ſolve all
thoſe evil Conſequences, that may be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
againſt GOD's Attributes, for
giving Man a Nature ſo qualify'd;
and will alſo fully anſwer all manner
of Exceptions and Complaints, that are
ordinarily made againſt his Temporal

both which muſt be preſum'd as
Grounds, upon which I may
build up the Argument ſo far in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

things are,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That every man is certainly
born with a Mind endued with thoſe
ſtrong Deſires and importunate Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
of being Happy; ſuch as are not
in their own power to lay aſide or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
at their own pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it cannot be doubted,
but that a Wiſe and Good GOD hath
one where or other provided for their
reſt and ſatisfaction; or he would never


<pb n="374" facs="tcp:42467:212"/>
have naturally given them ſuch qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.

                  <head>Section I.</head>
                  <p>IN this Firſt Section is deſign'd the firſt
Truth; And in order to a full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
of the caſe, it is requiſite, that
we firſt take notice, that God hath orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all other Beings, both ſenſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible,
to be carried on by a neceſſary
and natural impulſe, to the attainment
of all thoſe their proper ends, to which,
by his own ſole Will and ſovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
they were at firſt by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
unchangeably determined and affix'd.
But it was other wiſe in GOD's deſign,
when He created Man: For His Divine
purpoſe, as to him, was, That he ſhould
be created with ſuch free and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
Faculties, as by which he might
be firſt enabled to underſtand and judge,
and then be left at his own freedom to
chuſe and act for his own end, that is,
his own Happineſs; for nothing can be
propoſed as a proper and natural end to
a Rational Creature, but ſome adjudged
and choſen attainable Happineſs, that


<pb n="375" facs="tcp:42467:212"/>
may ſatisfie the importunity of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitive
Mind, and be accommodable to
the meaſures of his Rational Nature; as
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> diſcourſeth the Caſe in the firſt
Book of his Ethicks.</p>
                  <p>Now, that Man might be ſure to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the attainment of that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
end, by the uſe of thoſe his natural
Faculties of judging and chuſing it for
himſelf; GOD gave him alſo as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
an inclination, and as forcible an
appetite to ſpur him on, to look after his
own Happineſs, as any other Creature
had, to attain its natural end, and by as
uncontroulable an inſtinct.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is certain, That as
there is no qualification in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
more cloſely adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

nor more unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
univerſal to his whole

more predominant and authoritative.
For it alwaies gives Laws to all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties

                  <p>And then afterward, when he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to a compleater maturity of his
reaſoning Faculties, this impetuous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
diſpoſition reſtleſly drives him on
to the choice of ſome Undertaking or
other, by which he promiſeth to himſelf
an attainment of ſome kind of Happineſs,
as the end and ſcope of his intendment.
And as Men are variouſly inclin'd, and
differently (perhaps though but occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally)
byaſs'd in their Opinion of
this or that way of living, ſo doth this
reſtleſs Principle (by which men are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
acted) alwaies attend, and
haunt their ſeveral Minds, to hurry them


<pb n="378" facs="tcp:42467:214"/>
on to the ſearch after, and the choice of
ſomething, whatſoever it is, upon which
they have fix'd their opinion of being
Happy by it.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is, That when that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Impulſe ſcourgeth one man into
the pale Study, to paſs away his time
(and ſometimes his Health and Fortune)
in a ſolitary converſe with Papers, for
the attainment of Learning, as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
Happineſs; and when another is
call'd out by the ſame natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to ſacrifice his Peace and Quiet upon
the Military Theatre, or to wind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into the Intrigues of publick buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
upon a deſign of being Happy by
ſome Applauſe or Honour; a Third
makes uſe of all his Skill and Friends, to
ſhroud himſelf in the moſt private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement,
and to live in a total Seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from all publick affairs, as he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it to be the beſt Expedient, how he
may live an Eaſie and Happy life. And
as in theſe, ſo in all other inſtances of
like nature, men are alwaies tumbling
up and down in this buſie World, and do
behave themſelves like Meſſengers ſent
out for ſome loſt or undiſcover'd Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
who though they go a Hundred
waies to find it, yet they all went out
upon the ſame Errand, and were carried


<pb n="379" facs="tcp:42467:214"/>
on by the ſame Impulſe and Deſign of
projecting and proſecuting ſomething, in
which they all might expect and preſume
a ſatisfaction to themſelves. And all
this is done by the force of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
implanted deſires, and impatient ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
of being Happy, which GOD
gave them, and which they could not
at choice reſiſt.</p>

that the All-Wiſe and Good GOD

as to be alwaies by Nature reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly

were impoſſible: Which would be ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational

the Divine Nature, as that it cannot be

be intentionably implanted in him by a

                  <p>And then afterward (which is worſt

as to applaud the Being of a Stone,

                  <p>Theſe are ſuch conceptions of a Good

into the Heart of any man, but his,
that reſolves to maintain a diſpute againſt

the perfecteſt viſible piece of work,
which his Infinite Power and Wiſdom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
brought forth into Being.</p>
                  <p>And nothing but the ſuppoſal of a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

conceptions of the Divine Nature, as it


<pb n="382" facs="tcp:42467:216"/>
will fully be made evident in the latter
part of this Argument.</p>
                  <p>Now the deſign of this Firſt Chapter
is to evince, that infallibly there is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
in man by a natural and inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
inſtinct, ſuch a deſire and appetite
of being Happy. And then, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
Almighty GOD hath either
provided ſome where or other a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that may anſwer and determine thoſe
deſires, and ſatisfy thoſe appetites of his
nature, or elſe it muſt be preſumed,
that he Created him with the ſame infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
as to his mind, as if as to his Body
he had qualifyed him with a natural thirſt
and hunger, and then had allowed him
nothing, or what ſhould be unſufficient
to ſatiate ſuch importunate Appetites. A
Creation of being in ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
would look more like an act of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Tyranny, than the effect of a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Power and Authority.</p>
                  <p>But hath not God provided a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
means by the happy enjoyment of
a mans own being in this world (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Creatures have) for the ſatisfaction
of his natural deſires and appetites, ſo
that we ſhall not need to have recourſe
to the Exiſtence of another World, where
(we ſuppoſe) ſuch deſires may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
and determined? But that Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>IN this Chapter I ſhall evidently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
That there is nothing allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Mankind as attainable in
their preſent Mortal Lives, that
is ſufficient to give any tolerable acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence
to thoſe deſires, and appetites,
which GOD had Soveraignly and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
implanted in their minds: And
that without a conſideration had to the
poſſible enjoyment of the happineſs of
another Life. All that they can be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed

determining their deſires, that they will
be found to be little better than fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and diſappointment; and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
upon (as in reaſon they ſhould, if
nothing elſe can be expected or found)
as their preſent happineſs, will become
little more than a burden, and an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

               <div n="1" type="section">

                  <head>Section I.</head>
                  <p>IN this Firſt Section, I ſhall State the
Meaſures of what can poſſibly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
mans ſpecial happineſs in this Life.
And for that end let it be firſt conſidered,
That all that, which God hath ſet in mans
preſent view, and that moſt immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtands at the door of his ſenſes (the
common in-lets of objects to his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the imaginative part of his mind)
for his deſire and entertainment; and that
is agreed upon and celebrated in the
world by an univerſal conſent and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage,
as mans principal happineſs in this
life (where there is no concern for a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State in Faith or Practice) muſt be
at leaſt that which may be commonly
thought, and eſteemed a preſent ſufficient
Well-being, or an enjoyment of it in ſome
ſuch degree and proportion as may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably
accommodate the natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of a mans innate deſires.</p>
                  <p>Now if we ſtrictly examine the nature
of all that, which can be preſum'd to make
up ſuch a preſent Well-being, it will be
found to conſiſt in the enjoyment of ſo
much Knowledg, Health &amp; Plenty, as may
procure a man ſo much Reputation, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Power, Peace, &amp; other ſuch like accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations


<pb n="385" facs="tcp:42467:217"/>
as may afford him, in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
an eaſie and ſatisfactory way of
Living. For nothing elſe can otherwiſe
be ſuggeſted, which in any Sence may
be called a preſent attainable Happineſs,
if the concern of another State be laid
aſide.</p>
                  <p>As for the pretence of a ſufficient
Happineſs in this World, by <hi>Vertue's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her own Reward,</hi> the folly and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of it hath been examined in the
Fourth Section of the Second Chapter of
the Third Argument. And then, as to
the Pretenſions of Learning and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
(as ſome Philoſophers have
contended for them) they alſo have been
ſufficiently accounted for in my Second
Argument, <hi>Chap. 2. Sect.</hi> 1. &amp; 3.</p>
                  <p>Now, as to our deſcrib'd preſent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of a well-Being, allowing ſome
circumſtantial alterations in the opinion
of it, according to the different humours
and inclinations of Mens Minds, though
the whole World admire, proclaim, and
deſire it, as their chiefeſt Happineſs in
this mortal Life, yet it is certain, that in
its beſt circumſtances, and moſt deſirable
ſucceſſes, it could never be deſign'd of
GOD (for whatſoever other ends he
might pleaſe to allow it, of which an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
ſhall be preſently endeavour'd)


<pb n="386" facs="tcp:42467:218"/>
to be a Man's natural and ſufficient Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
upon the warranty of theſe Three
Reaſons to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>1. The Firſt is, That if GOD Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
had intended it as Man's ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Happineſs, He would either have
ſoveraignly given it to every Man, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
to enjoy it, or he would have
put it in every man's power to attain to
ſuch a well accommodated State, and
way of living at his own choice, and upon
his own endeavours for it. Which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Donation, or poſſibility of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
muſt be neceſſarily ſuppoſed, in
whatſoever it is, that is propounded
to ſuch an intellectual Agent as Man is,
for the ſatisfaction of his Rational De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and the Natural Appetites of his
Mind; or thoſe qualifications will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be given him, not only infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his own diſadvantage, but to be
his perpetual Calamity and Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                  <p>A Deſire, and not to enjoy, is upon
any account a very uneaſie State of
Mind, but ſuch a Deſire, without any
poſſibility of Enjoyment, is an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Now, that every man cannot attain
to the enjoyment of the ſeveral men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Branches and Conſtitutives of a


<pb n="387" facs="tcp:42467:218"/>
preſent well-being, by his own contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and at his own choice. And
then, Can any underſtanding Mind be
ſo inconſiderately credulous, as once to
imagine, that any ſuch thing can be a
man's proper, natural, and ſufficient Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
which, when he moſt eſpecially
needs it, he cannot have it, and when
he ſolemnly chooſeth it, and moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
endeavours for it, he cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
obtain it? But this Caſe hath
been largely accounted for already.
<hi>Are. 2. Chap. 1. Sect.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>2. But then, Secondly, Upon a ſuppoſal
that ſome few men, by ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
concurrent favourable hits of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
ſhould be ſo ſucceſsful in the
World, as to be made rare Examples of
ſuch a Happy way of Living, with all
its mention'd adjuncts and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(which not one of Ten Thouſand
ever enjoyed) yet it is certain, that even
then, that ſucceſsful State, (in whatſoever
degree it is allowed them) could never
be deſigned of GOD as their ſufficient
Happineſs (which muſt be ſuppoſed, if
no future World) becauſe it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be found to give their Minds any
conſtant and ſettled ſatisfaction, when
they were ſo poſſeſſed of it, but that


<pb n="388" facs="tcp:42467:219"/>
the more, and the longer thoſe men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
it, though no interruption had ever
intervened (which were a monſtrous
Vanity of Mind to have preſum'd) the
more they could not but diſcover its
inſufficiency to terminate their Deſires.
And to what degree ſoever they had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
their expectations of it, before they
attained it, yet they alwaies experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
ſound the Enjoyment of it to have
come ſo far beneath a tolerable ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that it hath often proved little
better than a baffle and real diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Mind. And further, it's obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that in the purſuit of ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Felicity, the acceſſion of every new
Acquiſt does alwaies but inflame mens
Appetites, and heighten their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of ſome more, newer, and other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments:
So that, in that reſpect, ſuch
mens Thoughts muſt neceſſarily be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be alwaies wandring up and
down, and unweariedly fluctuating in an
infinite Circle, and endleſs Maze, and
Reciprocation of Deſires and Unſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
Expectations and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>And, the main Reaſon of all this (as
<hi>Seneca</hi> well obſerves) is, Becauſe
there is not any thing in the World


<pb n="389" facs="tcp:42467:219"/>
that is enough;<note place="margin">Cupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati nihil ſatis.

Enjoyments are too ſtrait and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd.
For though, perhaps, they
are not ſo for mens preſent ordinary
uſe, yet they will alwaies be found to
be ſo, for the ſatisfaction of the natural
deſires of their Minds.</p>
                  <p>And this is the very Reaſon, Why
many Perſons that enjoy the fulleſt Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in appearance to others, all they
could wiſh for, yet may be unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
uneaſie in their own Minds, and
oftentimes very unbecomingly froward
in their demeanour to others, and even
to them, whoſe fidelity, kindneſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
they have cauſe to applaud and
love: I ſay, all this is, becauſe their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
were originally and naturally fitted
for a bigger, and indeed, for another kind
of Happineſs, than what this World could
afford them.</p>
                  <p>And upon this account it is, that Sir
<hi>Francis Bacon</hi> takes notice,<note place="margin">Cogita, quamdiu eadem feceris, mori velle, non tantum fortis, aut miſer, ſed etiam faſtidioſus. <hi>Eſſ.</hi> 2.</note> (which he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed

that is, ſuch as are tyr'd with any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

as willing to die, and leave them, as the
ſtout, and the miſerable that wants them;
and that becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they have
created a wearineſs of doing the ſame
thing ſo often over and over.</hi> It's certain
therefore, by a moſt neceſſary and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
conſequence, that mens Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
are to be ſatiated with ſome thing
that is not here to be found, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

or no where at all; which would
be a Reproach to the CREATOUR's

                  <p>The Third and Laſt Reaſon, to ſhew
the inſufficiency of all the Enjoyments
with which a Man can poſſibly be

Deſires of being Happy, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they will alwaies be (and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

pleaſ'd, and happy, that conſiders, That
all his Enjoyments are poſſeſſed with a
perpetual danger of Change and Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.
I ſay, Where things are thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure,
What conſidering Mind can ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
a Reaſon of being Happy by any


<pb n="393" facs="tcp:42467:221"/>
the greateſt Enjoyments? And ſurely,
where right Reaſon can give no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for it, that Mind cannot be truly
ſatisfied in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is nothing in Nature truly Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
but what is exempt

                     <note place="margin">Non enim beatum eſt, niſi quod intrepidum. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuſpecta malè vivitur.</note>

the preſent Favour of GOD, and the

World, to him that lives a Vertuous and

                  <p>Theſe are the Three general Reaſons,
which I have offer'd againſt the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of mans being truly happy by
any thing that bears the name of an
outward Well-being, in it's beſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
and therefore not likely to be
deſign'd of GOD for Man's choice, as
ſufficient to anſwer, and determine the
created natural Deſires of his Mind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his own Happineſs. But the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
hath ſomething to ſay againſt all
this, which muſt be conſidered.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:42467:222"/>
                  <head>Section II.</head>
                  <p>THerefore, this Second Section tells
us, That the earneſt Pretenders to
a preſent poſſible Proſperity, and the
mighty Admirers of it, will, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all this, think and ſay, That
they are not to be turned off from their
own ſence of being happy with ſuch
a dry Philoſophical Lecture as this;
and that inſtead of being convinced by
theſe Reaſons, they will with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Scorn enough, mock at the
Divine that preacheth them, or the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
that diſputes for them; or at
the Sober and the Meek, the Juſt and
the Charitable, that do exemplarily
make uſe of them, to the practical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probration
of their Follies.</p>
                  <p>But then I am particularly obliged
to take notice, That there be three
ſorts of ſuch Men, (of which a great
part of Mankind do appear at all times
to conſiſt) who are alwaies more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately
and uncontroulably bent againſt
theſe, and all other Arguments, how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
ſoever, that can be offered in
this caſe: And with theſe Men I am
willing to treat apart, and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a cloſer Method.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="395" facs="tcp:42467:222"/>
And the Firſt of thoſe Three, are
the mighty Men of Wealth, who in
Contempt of the former Reaſons (which
they can no more anſwer, than be
wiſe) are reſolv'd to think of no other
Happineſs, but to be perpetually liſting
numbers to their Regiment of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
and catalogueing more Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
to their encreaſing Territories,
that they may be proclaimed Rich, and
admired as Prodigies for their famous
Acquiſitions. For it's generally obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
That Covetouſneſs and Pride, are
complicated in the ſame Perſon, and do
ſhew themſelves in all their Actions,
where they may be competible. And
therefore, theſe men will defy the Man,
that dares preſume to charge their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with an obligation of being juſt or
merciful, ingenuous or humble upon the
reaſonable Arguments of making a ſafe
Proviſion, and an undefeizable Eſtate
for themſelves, in another, and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
World.</p>
                  <p>The next ſilly Unattendant to the
former Reaſons, is the Man of Buſtle
and Ambition, and he wonders that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man ſhould dare, with ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as theſe, to affront his humour
in the preſent ſenſe of his own ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Happineſs. And when he is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="396" facs="tcp:42467:223"/>
in a long Liſt, the Names, Wealth,
and Vertue of his Anceſtors; and is
relating ſome inſtances of his own Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
&amp; ſucceſsful Atchievements (though
it were (perhaps) but in a Duel for
a vain Woman, or in Revenge for an
idle Word) that Man, that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to aggrandize his Bravery, and to
admire his Happineſs upon ſuch preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
or inform him of any other ſober
inſtances of Honour, and true Fortitude,
muſt be content for a while, to bear
the Character of an ignoble and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The Third of that obſtinate ſort of
Men, is the ſorry Voluptuary, who,
with Contempt enough of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of both the other, bleſſeth himſelf
in the opinion of his own Happineſs,
and thinks that there needs no other to
be offered to him for his preſent ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
than to be rock'd aſleep in ſome
ſenſual Pleaſures; and would fain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
that he enjoys his Being to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and Happineſs enough, while he
is gratifying his Senſual Apperites; and
then laughs at all thoſe, that ſhall
bring Reaſons to adviſe him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as a Pack of pitiful empty Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that don't underſtand the Town,
(as they call it) and that don't know


<pb n="397" facs="tcp:42467:223"/>
what's Good Breeding; Eating, and
Drinking, Gallantry, and Love.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the three ſorts of men that
almoſt divide the vain World between
them, and that are eſpecially preſumed
not to be at leiſure, to attend to the
examination of ſuch general Reaſons, as
are alledged for the unſufficiency of all
preſent enjoyments, or of what may be
offered for the happineſs of another
World: And therefore, are obſtinately ſet
to reſiſt all poſſible counſels, that may
be given to engage them in the ſerious
thoughts of it.</p>
                  <p>And now, that there may be nothing
omitted, to oblige ſuch men to take
a full account of their own follies, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but judge it very reaſonable, that
beſides thoſe three general imperfections,
to which all temporal enjoyments are in
common certainly ſubjected, and as ſo
qualified, are rendred uncapable to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
any true happineſs to ſuch a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Creature, as can diſcourſe its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
I ſay, I cannot but judge it both
Neceſſary and Charitable, that I may
make the conviction more compleat and
available; that beſides thoſe three Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that may inform their reaſons in
general, I may particularly arreſt theſe
mens ſeveral humours, and miſtaken ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents


<pb n="398" facs="tcp:42467:224"/>
of their own happineſs, with a
proper remonſtrance againſt every one
of thoſe pretended principal conſtitutives
of humane proſperity; proving that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them have their proper and
particular inſufficiences, (beſides thoſe
former general defailancies) to make a
Man truly happy. And I ſhall give every
one of them a fair Trial apart.</p>
                  <p>1. And then, as to the firſt admir'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of humane happineſs, Wealth,
let the forementioned men of Money
ſeriouſly count and conſider with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
what it is in its ſelf and proper
nature; and in the Iſſue of their thoughts
they muſt find, that it is no more, but
a ſervant to their natural neceſſities, and
at beſt, but an expedient to attain the
better conveniences and decencies of
their ſhort and mortal lives: And then,
what there is more than will well ſerve
thoſe ordinary ends, (which an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
plenty may attain to with leſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and fewer dangers and fears) muſt
in reaſon be accounted a redundant ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage,
either to become a prey for them,
to whoſe truſt and management it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
or to be thrown over board, to
be catch'd up by them, that perhaps nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lov'd his perſon, nor deſerved the
advantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="399" facs="tcp:42467:224"/>
And indeed, What ſignifies a vaſt and
over-grown fortune, but noiſe and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when the Fruitleſs Splendour of it
ſhall be conſiderately diſcounted? For if the
Owner of it be Good, Vertuous, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
qualifi'd, the burden of his Duties
to GOD and Man is but ſo much the more
encreaſed, and the acquitment of a good
Conſcience ſo much the more nice and
difficult; and his temptations to Folly
will be infinitely multiply'd. If it be ſaid,
that his plenty and greatneſs in the
World's eye, may upon ſeveral accounts
adapt him the better to aſſiſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of publick Government, it's true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirmed: But then where lies the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of it?<note place="margin">Magna ſervitus eſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na fortuna. <hi>Sen. ad Polyb. Cons.</hi>
                     </note> It is no more
than to eaſe others of that
common burden, and for
the benefit of thoſe, who
know not how to be ſatisfied with their
own good: It is but to keep tame an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
multitude; and when others may
ſleep quietly in their retir'd privacies, to
be awake to watch over Lyons and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
from devouring one another. For all
which, he muſt expect little elſe, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude;
and perhaps he may be pay'd
for all his Cares and Pains, with nothing
elſe but Spite and Hatred, the uſual Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Returns, for the moſt careful and
vigilant Authorities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:42467:225"/>
But if that Great Man been't good;
that is, firſt, if his humour be to put
his ſurpluſage to a Trade of further
Encreaſe, how much is he better than
ſome common Officer, or publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
of a great Revenue; by which,
in time, he may gain the repute of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the common Caſh-keeper of the
Country, and ſo may poſſibly be on all
hands addreſſed to, to find Money, to
defray the Expences of Fools and Sots
with Summs, which (perhaps) his eyes
may never ſee more, but in a little
Scrole; or which his next Generation
may abuſe to maintain the Charges of
ſome vain and ſilly way of living? Or
if the mighty Man be ſenſually diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
that is, if he expends his redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
ſurpluſage in debaucheries, how
much will his houſe differ from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Inn and Hoſtage, unleſs it be, that
it's ſo much a greater one? And if he
hath a parcel of looſe People of both
Sexes in it, his abuſed Plenties may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
procure his Houſe a more famous,
but a worſer Name.</p>

And, for which

thus we have examined the first material
a Mortal's preſent reputed Felicity.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Man of Honour,
What ſignifies that which he calls
Greatneſs or Splendor, or an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
deſign'd popular reputation in the


<pb n="402" facs="tcp:42467:226"/>
World, when the nature of it is cloſely
examined? For, it will be found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
chiefly upon incompetent Judges of
worth; and it ſeldom falls out to be the
Portion of them that truly deſerve it.
Inſomuch, that many Wiſe and Vertuous
Perſons have been ſo far from being am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouſly
ſtruggling for ſuch an Honour,
that they have ſhunn'd and avoided it, as
much as they could: And have been
more really aſhamed of a popular Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Applauſe, than other vain men
have been concerned to be diſappointed
of them.</p>
                  <p>But then, when it hath happened, that
the vulgar Vogue hath not been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
(which is very ſeldom) yet that
acquir'd Honour muſt lay at the Feet of
unconſtant Mortals, and upon the hazard
of every trivial Miſcarriage, and miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of Actions; for which ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Envy (it's certain Attendant) will
never want a contrivement, and an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we ſee, that Worldly Honour
very ſeldom follows either Vertue, or
any other worthy qualification of Mind,
but that it purely depends upon Wealth,
by what indirect Acts and Arts ſoever
attain'd, and how unworthily ſoever uſed

And this is the ſorry Nature of
the Second reputed Conſtitutive of

                  <p>3. Then as to the Man of Pleaſure,
if the nature of it be balanc'd by a

part of Man; that is, his inferiour
Appetites. And about which, his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Faculties ſhall be concern'd in
nothing more, than in diſcovering it's

                  <p>And if you meaſure the duration of
ſenſual Pleaſure, it's gone as ſoon as

extinction. And if it hath any repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Periods, the moſt deſirable inſtances

enjoyment of humane Life, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
how ridiculouſly the wiſeſt men
have behaved themſelves in their Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to find out a way how to fix it in
this World. But that's the buſineſs of
the next Section.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>Section III.</head>
                  <p>THis laſt Section diſcovers the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
and diſagreeing apprehenſions
of all thoſe Philoſophers and Wiſe men,
who endeavour'd to promote a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for the attainment of a real Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in this preſent State. And, it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
that even the Learned'st ſort of
them, like men at a loſs where to fix and
determine ſuch a chiefeſt Good, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Happineſs, ventured at every thing
to which their humour, inclinations,
and their reſolved compliance with a
Sect, guided their Sentiments and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions:
Dealing in their Opinions
of Man's ſummary and chiefeſt Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,


<pb n="407" facs="tcp:42467:228"/>
as the old <hi>Egyptians</hi> did with the
Supreme Deity, which, becauſe they
found it not among the Objects of a
preſent ſenſible perception, they plac'd
it in every contemptible part of the
Creation, and unmanly ador'd it where
they fix'd it.</p>
                  <p>But then our Opinioniſts diſtant and
innumerous diſagreements among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
was a certain ſign, that they had
all loſt their Mark and Standard; and
were become like men, who finding no
certain Path to direct their Progreſs, (as
it is the univerſal fate of all Errour)
wandered about, whitherſoever their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Fancies, or ſome inſtant Accident
determin'd their choice and motion:
But ſtill they found themſelves out of the
way, and the farther they went on, to
look for ſuch a preſent Happineſs, the
more their bewilder'd Minds diſcover'd
to them the miſfortune of their Miſtakes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, of the many that ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have ſucceeded in their Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
after the True Happineſs of Man, few
agreed in any one thing, in which it
ſhould conſiſt. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> reckons up from
<hi>Marcus Varro</hi> Two Hundred Eighty eight
ſeveral Opinions of Man's Chiefeſt Good.<note place="margin">Aug. de Civit. Dei, lib. 19. cap. 1.</note>
And <hi>Tully</hi> accounts a great many, and
thoſe (as he averrs) according to the


<pb n="408" facs="tcp:42467:229"/>
Sence of the moſt remarkably Learned
Adventurers, to find it out.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Epicureans</hi> placed it in Pleaſure,
the <hi>Stoicks</hi> in the habits of Vertue, the
<hi>Peripateticks</hi> in the Acts and Exerciſes of
it: Some of them placed it in Knowledge
and Contemplation, and others in Power
and Dominion,<note place="margin">Eth. lib. 10.</note> and many in Friendſhip,
as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> largely diſcourſeth the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of them. Therefore the ſame <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
acknowledgeth, That
there was never any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,<note place="margin">De nulla quaeſtione majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem eſſe inter ſummos viros diſſentionem, quàm de ea, quaenam res ſit ſummum honum. <hi>Lib. 5. de finibus.</hi>

about which the
moſt conſiderable ſort of
men had ſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Sences, as about that, in which
Man's chiefeſt Good and Happineſs ſhould
be placed. And <hi>Stobaeus</hi> quotes the
words of the Ancient <hi>Philemon,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,
<hi>That the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
had laboured away
their time,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                        </gap>. Ser. 53.</note> 
                     <hi>how they might
find out the Chiefeſt Good,
but all in vain. And while
ſome placed it in one thing,
and ſome in another, ſome
in Wiſdom, and ſome in Vertue, they did
rather perplex the Notion, than find out
what it was.</hi> Thus a Heathen could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
the Caſe a great while ago.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:42467:229"/>
But, among the different fond Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
which the layers aſide of a Future
State, whether in Faith or Practice, have
vainly ſuggeſted to their Thoughts, as
their moſt ſatisfactory Felicity; I muſt
not forget more ſtrictly to examine thoſe
many mens pretenſions, who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
for a Senſe of being Happy, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to tranſmit ſomething of
themſelves to Futurity, though it were
but to keep alive their Names and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials
to after Ages.</p>
                  <p>And the Folly of this I ſhall at laſt
the more induſtriouſly and fully endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to repreſent, becauſe I perceive,
that in thoſe men, with whom ſuch a
deſign of Happineſs hath prevailed, their
intendments have been generally more
ſteadily and conſtantly fix'd and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
than in any other of the former
Pretenſions to humane Happineſs; where
the thoughts of another World have been
ſuſpended and ſuperſeded.</p>
                  <p>And the Reaſon of this my Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is, Becauſe ſuch kinds of Deſigns
as theſe, are more accommodable to
that natural diſpoſition, that is generally
implanted in mens Minds, to aim at
ſomething that is Future, and indeed
(if poſſible) Immortal. And therefore
it is, that thoſe men that have in any


<pb n="410" facs="tcp:42467:230"/>
kind been governed by that natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
are ſo much the more apt to be
pleaſed with their own miſtakes, as that
their Deſigns do bear a nearer aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and alliance to the proſecution and
attainment of the truly immortal and
eternal Happineſs; for which (it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear)
Man was principally and deſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made.</p>
                  <p>And without doubt, that temper in
Man's mind, towards Futurity, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it's abuſed to ſuch trivial purpoſes,
was wiſely and graciouſly allowed by
a Good GOD to him in his very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as a great advantage for his more
eaſie and more natural proſecution of
that, which ſhould be really his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Bliſs, when he ſhould go about
that Happy Work.</p>
                  <p>Now, an inſtance of this natural
diſpoſition, is very often expreſſed in
Planting, Building, Experimenting, and
Writing, and in ſuch like Intendments;
even when of the benefits of ſuch Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings,
the very Projectors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
could not but underſtand, that
they ſhould either never be partakers,
or but for ſome inconſiderable ſpace of
time. But, the Reaſon upon which they
founded their Encouragement, was, That
they found themſelves like to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed


<pb n="411" facs="tcp:42467:230"/>
that their Projections might remain
to Futurity, as ſtanding Remarques of
their Care, and Skill, and Honour, or
they know not what. And poſſibly,
theſe men having before experimented
(as it's frequently obſerved in the
World) the defects of all other ſenſual
Pleaſures, they adventured upon this
laſt Deſign in the wiſer and declining
part of their Lives, as that which did
more accommodate the natural Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
that is in all men (if they did not
over-rule it) towards the moſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Happineſs of a Future Life.</p>
                  <p>And, I believe, thus were the Thoughts
of <hi>Solon</hi> governed, when he had told
<hi>Croeſus,</hi> the rich <hi>Lydian</hi> King (after he
had ſhown him his vaſt Treaſures, and
aſked him, Whether he did not believe
him to be an Happy man, that was
Maſter of ſuch Wealth and Kingdoms)
That no Man ought to be reputed Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
till after Death. I ſay, Something
of that nature prevailed
with <hi>Solon</hi> to uſe that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,<note place="margin">—<gap reason="foreign">

as appears by the
manner of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s large
and induſtrious confutation of him in
the firſt Book of his Ethicks. And it
is ſuppoſed that <hi>Ovid</hi> turned it into


<pb n="412" facs="tcp:42467:231"/>

                  <p>Now, as this miſtaken Expedient for
humane Happineſs hath govern'd no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
part of the vain World,
and more particularly ſuch, whoſe Age
and Experience might have ſtock'd them
with a ſounder Judgment, ſo it hath
been mightily endeavoured by Two
ſorts of men, of whom I muſt now
eſpecially take notice.</p>
                  <p>And, the firſt of thoſe are they,
whoſe deſign it is to be preparing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of their Skill in Arts and
Sciences, and in ſome very chargeable
and laborious Experiment, thereby to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
their mortalities, and to acquire an
everlaſting Fame to themſelves, when they
were gone off from their mortal Stations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I take notice, that there
hath been others of another diſtant
temper, who all their daies had been
drudging in Gare and Toil, and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exerciſing all their ſkill, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves all reaſonable ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in their own preſent Plenties, with
a deſign to heap a Fortune big enough
to ſet up a Family of their own Name
in vogue and note in the World, when


<pb n="413" facs="tcp:42467:231"/>
they were gone; thinking thereby to
immortalize themſelves in their own
Poſterity; and thereby creating to
themſelves ſo much the greater opinion
of their own Happineſs and Satisfaction,
as that they had gone ſo far towards
a perpetuation of their pretended Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs:
Concerning which kind of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
the excellent Author of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio
Medici</hi> hath this Expreſſion.<note place="margin">Part 1. Sect. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>This
Conceit and counterfeit Subſiſtence in our
Progenies, ſeems to me a meer Fallacy,
unworthy the deſires of a Man, that can
but conceive a Thought of the next World:
who in a Nobler Ambition ſhould deſire to
live in his Subſtance in Heaven, rather
than in his Name and Shadow in the
Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as to both which Deſigners for
any preſent or after Happineſs, (I know
not which to call it) were it not that
ſometimes many commendable things
have been done for the benefit of thoſe
that are preſent and to come, ſo as that
their doing Good might turn to ſome
happy account to themſelves in a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State, their deſign is liable to as
many unaccountable Exceptions, as moſt
other the former unfortunate Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
for a ſettled Happineſs in this
Life, have been ſubject to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="414" facs="tcp:42467:232"/>
1. As for the Firſt ſort of theſe I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who had ſtifled their natural Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
deſign'd by GOD and Nature
for the better purſuance of ſomething,
by which they might be made really
futurely Happy; and then would give
themſelves leave to think of no other
Happineſs, but what they might acquire
by leaving ſome laſting Monuments of
their Skill and Labours after them,
What words are little enough to expreſs
the fondneſs of ſuch an Intendment?</p>
                  <p>For, if we meaſure the ſubſtance of
their Happineſs, with reſpect to ſuch a
Futurity, (as is pretended) it can be
placed no where elſe, but in a fond
Propoſal of ſomething to their own
minds, of which (ſuppoſing their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of a Future State) they themſelves
can never have any poſſible ſenſe or
enjoyment, and of which at preſent they
can have no perception, but as in a pure
Romantick notion, and empty imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And by which, they ſhall have
juſt ſo much real Happineſs, as that
man can preſume himſelf to have a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
defence in a time of Danger,
who had ſtudied to build Caſtles in the
Air, by his extravagant Fancy.</p>
                  <p>What preſent real Felicity could <hi>Ovid</hi>
propound to himſelf in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,


<pb n="415" facs="tcp:42467:232"/>
as to a future Fame (which
was the only thing that he is preſum'd
to aim at) when he flouriſhed his vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Epilogue to his Metamorphoſis any
more, than if his Name had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to ſurvive but for his being the
Author of ſuch a ridiculous Story as
<hi>Tom Thumb;</hi> or, as if <hi>Juvenal</hi> had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
him among his blundering Poets;
or, that his Reputation had been buried
with others as conſiderable as himſelf,
in a perpetual night of Oblivion and
nothing?</p>
                  <p>And, What more could other the
fam'd Authors of extraordinary experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Inventions propound to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by the credit of their Operations,
when they could not but know, that in
a ſhort time they ſhould have far leſs
ſenſe of any happineſs or ſatisfaction by
them, as to their own minds, than the
Worms ſhould enjoy, who were ready
to try freſh Experiments upon their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in thoſe natural Laboratories, their
Graves?</p>
                  <p>And, if it be ſaid, that poſſibly it
might be ſome happineſs to them, that
they could take a certain preſent ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in their Thoughts, that they
ſhould ſurvive themſelves in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations;
My Anſwer is, That that


<pb n="416" facs="tcp:42467:233"/>
Pleaſure could be no more or greater
than if the ſame men ſhould, like
Knights Errants, have perſwaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that they ſhould have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be afterwards reputed as Kings,
and Princes; and then ſhould take a
great deal of ſilly care to be ſo recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in a Romantick Story.</p>
                  <p>The Happineſs of them both in each
reſpect is much the ſame. And then,
Who but mad men could imagine it to
be a Felicity ſo conſiderable, as that
GOD ſhould allow them no other, or
no better enjoyment, to determine their
natural deſires of being Happy, but in
ſuch ridiculous Triflings of their own
imaginations?</p>
                  <p>2. Then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> as for the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of thoſe that have all their Lives
laid long Trains, to purchaſe large Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
and build ſtately Palaces, on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to perpetuate their Names in a
fam'd Family after them, it is much the
ſame with the former pretenſions, and
perhaps the folly of it is, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
leſs accountable, if they alſo ſhall
have really neglected the Concerns of
their future Happineſs in another World.</p>
                  <p>For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Foundation of this
imaginary Happineſs to themſelves, is
not certainly True; for it's yet a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute


<pb n="417" facs="tcp:42467:233"/>
among men, Whether a tranſmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a greatly famous Fortune can
make Poſterity more happy than a lower
Plenty; and the wiſeſt men have agreed
upon the latter. But then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> If
the Foundation of their fanſied Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
were in that reſpect really True, yet
it were infinitely vain to relie upon it,
and that, becauſe it were upon a very
great uncertainty and hazard, whether
their own Poſterity ſhould ever inherit it,
or whether any of their near Relations
ſhould ever ſhare their amaſs'd Fortunes,
when they die: But that their Eſtates might
become, like a rich ſhipwrack, to be divided
among Strangers, or perhaps among ſuch
whom they neither loved nor valued.
Or, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If it be granted, that thoſe
which they deſigned ſhould enjoy them,
yet it was ſtill very uncertain, whether
they would then preſerve thoſe famous
Fortunes as they intended, or not ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
ſcatter them, as faſt as themſelves
had gathered them together; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
otherwiſe they had not all their
lives been providing a vaſt Stock, for a
Sot to play the fool with, or for ſome
unworthy Perſon, that ſhall ungrateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet juſtly, deride the Gainers of it,
(though perhaps his own Parents) for
their ridiculous penury to themſelves, to


<pb n="418" facs="tcp:42467:234"/>
obtain ſuch a fortune for him; or,
<hi>Fourthly,</hi> If it ſhall happen that their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
ſhall be poſſeſſed by one of an
honeſt and worthy Mind, yet it's poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the ſame Perſon that enjoys
them, may judge himſelf never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
if not much the worſe for them, in
many reſpects. That is, When he ſhall
find himſelf ſubject to more Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to miſcarry in his Vertue, and to
be involved in ſuch incumbrances as may
make his life more uneaſie; and that
eſpecially if he ſhall be ſenſible, that that
Eſtate was unworthily and unjuſtly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
or baſely &amp; ſcandalouſly kept for him.</p>
                  <p>So that if all thoſe ſilly promoters
of great Eſtates, ſhould within a few
Years after they were committed to their
little tenements under-ground, riſe again,
and take a proſpect of what becomes
of the Iſſue of all their pinching Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities,
Cares and Cunning, they would
commonly ſee little elſe, but the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
effects of their own folly and miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
deſigns, and find, that the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
they enjoyed upon their projections
for Poſterity, had all along been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but one vain Dream of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that never was like to come to
paſs according to their own purpoſes
and expectations. But then laſtly, if all


<pb n="419" facs="tcp:42467:234"/>
things had ſucceeded according to the
meaſures of their own fancy and deſign;
yet it's certain, that their own dry'd and
broken Skeleton (all that is preſumed to
remain of themſelves, if no Future State)
ſhall no more be concerned in the Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
of their ſucceeding Generations, than
in the Grandeur of the great <hi>Mogul,</hi> or the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch; and that it ſhall then
be all one to them, whether their Sons
be Emperours or Laqueys, or whether
they be Soveraigns of the Ocean, or but
Admirals of ſome poor <hi>Indian</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo.
For what is the difference to a
dead Parent (for any ſenſe he can have
of it, ſuppoſing no Future State) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Child be a Triumphant <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi>
or a Captive <hi>Bajazet,</hi> a Victorious
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> or an unfortunate <hi>Pompey,</hi> or to
have been a Slave to either of them.
The drudging projectour may have Joy
or Sorrow in his preſent Portion while he
lives, and he does his duty if he provides
for them that come after him, but he
can't be concern'd in the Proſperity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, whom he leaves behind him
(as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves in his Conteſt with
<hi>Solon</hi>'s Principle);<note place="margin">

                  <p>And now, what I have ſaid in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
of theſe two famous ſorts of triflers,
with their natural inclinations, to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
their happineſs on that account, I
may ſay the ſame in general of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who have any other ways pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
a deſign of felicity to themſelves
by leaving memorials of their names be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them.</p>
                  <p>It's true, the memory of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is Bleſſed; that is, to others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as ſome additional honour to rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
or as exemplary to them and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but as to themſelves, they ſhall
have no more perception of it, or of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
happineſs by it, (laying aſide the
thoughts of another World) than the
ſenſeleſs Duſt, or the cold Monument
that covers them: All the moſt famouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remark'd inſtances of their Vertue, or
wiſdom, ſhall be no more to them, than
if it were recorded, at what time, or in
what Country, they had ty'd up their
Garters, or turn'd to the Wall for their
Natural Eaſe.</p>
                  <p>What real happineſs could thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Aegyptians</hi> promiſe to themſelves,
that their Bones were to lie under

                  <p>And thus I have accounted for ſome
of the various ſentiments of thoſe that
have ſtudied all that's poſſible, to ſix Mans
ſummary Felicity in ſomething enjoyable
in his preſent Mortal Life, or with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to futurity in the ridiculous ſence
I have juſt now repreſented it; and my
deſign therein is, that it may appear,
that ſuch men have ſufficiently baffled
and condemned themſelves by their own
confuſions of mind, and that by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities
of their different opinions, and
their ſeveral defective methods of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to be happy in this life, they have
expreſly convinced the World, that there
is no kind of happineſs can determine
mens minds to an univerſal agreement,
that is founded upon any thing that is
propoſable or enjoyable in this mortal
State.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it's very reaſonable,
and very neceſſary to be believed, that
if God had deſigned, that ſuch an happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as might poſſibly have anſwered and


<pb n="422" facs="tcp:42467:236"/>
fix'd all mens Deſires and Appetites,
ſhould have been attainable in this
mortal life, there would have been
a propoſal of ſome common and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Good, which all men might have
plainly underſtood, and in which all
minds ſhould have as univerſally and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
agreed.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have diſcharg'd my ſelf of
the Second Head of my Diſcourſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the perfecting this Argument for
a Future State; that is, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to demonſtrate, That there is
nothing propoſed as enjoyable in Man's
mortal Life, by any Objects and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions
whatſoever, that can tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
anſwer Man's natural Appetite of
being Happy, or that can agreeably ſuit
that Capacity that GOD gave him by
Creation to enjoy it.</p>
                  <p>And this I have done by an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of every thing in the World, that is
pretended for it in particular; and by
ſhewing to what intolerable defects they
are all ſubject in general.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it muſt neceſſarily follow,
or nothing elſe can reconcile the mind of
Man to any kind repreſentation of God's
Goodneſs, that he ſhould give to all men
by a neceſſary inſtinct, ſuch an unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
deſire and reſtleſs expectation of an


<pb n="423" facs="tcp:42467:236"/>
Happineſs, which cannot be found any
where while he remains in this preſent
State; I ſay, It muſt then neceſſarily
follow, that there is another State to
come, in which all that heartily deſire
it, and regularly labour for it, upon the
performance of ſuch terms as GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and which a found Reaſon may
ſuggeſt as neceſſary for that end, may
be made compleatly, and ſatisfactorily
Happy. But that is the buſineſs of the

                  <p>IN this Firſt Section, I ſhall plainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that whatſoever may be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
againſt the Honour of the Divine

by the ſuppoſal of ſuch a State, I
need not here go about to advance the
Happineſs of it, by any conjectural Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies.
The nature and meaſures of it
are a reſerve with GOD, and it were a
criminal Curioſity, and a great Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
to be too inquiſitive into it, as I
have diſcours'd the caſe more fully in
my Firſt Argument; I ſhall here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
only offer by way of illuſtration,
what the preſent univerſal Experience of
the Vertuous and Pious can evince and
verifie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="425" facs="tcp:42467:238"/>
For, whoſoever he is, that ſhall ſet
his Heart to exert thoſe natural and
ſtrong inclinations of his Mind, for the
attainment of that Great end, and ſhall
affectionately place his Thoughts and
Deſires, his Deſigns and Hopes upon it,
and then ſhall accordingly live up to ſuch
terms and conditions, by which it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon all common reaſon, that it is
to be expected and attained at the Hand
of GOD, (upon whoſe good Pleaſure
and free Donation it perfectly depends)
I ſay, That man ſhall find ſuch a fitneſs
and ſuitableneſs of all thoſe his natural
qualifications to thoſe excellent Objects,
that in time he may be made ſenſible,
that Almighty GOD might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him any other temper of mind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
rather than that natural power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Appetite after his own Happineſs;
which he now obſerves to be ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to drive him on through all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
of what he is to do and ſuffer,
for the attainment of that future State of
Bliſs.</p>
                  <p>So that he ſhall be ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
and objecting againſt God, for
creating him with ſuch a temper, and
(otherwiſe) troubleſome diſpoſition of
mind, that he ſhall find pregnant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
not only to juſtifie, but to love and


<pb n="426" facs="tcp:42467:239"/>
glorifie His Goodneſs, for making him
ſuch a Creature as he is, and with a mind
ſo naturally qualify'd.</p>
                  <p>For though, while his inclinations and
deſires were trifling with the vain Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of this Life, and were engaged in
their natural Vigour, for the attainment
of a preſent pretended Happineſs by
them, they were uneaſie and unquiet,
as being employed about an end, for
which they were not naturally diſpoſed,
yet they were once terminated upon the
concerns of a Happineſs to come, and
then exerciſed about the Actions and
Offices that tend to it, they will be
found to all purpoſes ſo approveable, as
they will appear needful to enliven his
Courage againſt all Temptations to his
own abuſe, by the choice of every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
Object; and to heighten his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs
in the performance of all ſuch
good actions, as reaſonably tend to its
attainment.</p>
                  <p>And further, Such a man ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
think well of GOD, that He gave him
ſuch natural diſpoſitions of mind, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe they adapt him for thoſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Enjoyments in future, but alſo for the
preſent eaſe and complacency, which he
ſhall find in the very uſe of them to that
Great end, by the proemial repaſts of a


<pb n="427" facs="tcp:42467:239"/>
moſt eaſie, and ſometimes a raviſhing
Expectation. That is, Such a Pious man's
Deſires will be qualified with Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
while he is in the way, as well as
be compleatly ſatisfied at his Journeys
end. So that, as he would not refuſe
the Objects of his religious deſires for
any other whatſoever, that can be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him beſides, ſo he would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
the very Comfort and preſent
Happineſs of thoſe expectations, for the
real Poſſeſſion of all the Pleaſures and
ſeeming ſatisfactions which this World
can afford him.</p>
                  <p>The ſumm is, If theſe Experiences be
duly conſidered, What can be alledged
to juſtifie the leaſt unkind Thought or
Opinion of GOD's Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
in putting Man's nature into ſuch
an order, or that He implanted in him
ſuch a Diſpoſition? When it appears,
that it is ſo ſubſervient for, and ſo ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to, his Chiefeſt Good; that is, that
it is ſo fitted for the uſe of all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of attaining it here, and that it
renders him ſo adequately capacitated,
for the better reception of it hereafter.</p>
                  <p>A faint Deſire would not have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
ſo great an Engagement, nor have
been receptive of ſo mighty an Object.</p>
                  <p>And this ſolves the Firſt Doubt which

                  <p>IN this Section it will appear, That

in themſelves to be Ordinations of
GOD's Great Wiſdom, to preſerve Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind

whenſoever he is poſſeſſed of them.</p>
                  <p>And then, the Outcries that are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by Philoſophers, Poets, and ſome
contemplative Perſons againſt them, and
the ordinary clamours of idle mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
diſſatisfactions by them,
(whereby oftentimes unkind Reflections


<pb n="429" facs="tcp:42467:240"/>
are made againſt the Providence of God,
in his ordinary diſpenſations of them)
will be found to ariſe from no other
cauſe, but from their not believing, or
not ſufficiently conſidering the certainty
of a Future State and Happineſs, (for
whoſe Intereſt they may be improved)
to determine their higher deſires and
appetites.</p>
                  <p>For, all thoſe Exceptions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
would then appear to take their
Original from mens promiſing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring

their principal End, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Felicity (which God did never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

ſhort of their expected ſatisfactions, have
rendered them obnoxious to ſuch unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

                  <p>Had they believed, and made (as in

end, and propoſed it to themſelves, as
their Supreme Happineſs, and then had
looked upon thoſe outward Temporary
Enjoyments, to be deſired and uſed in
a manner, and with a value anſwerable
to their kind, and no more; that is, to
ſerve their natural preſent needs, and for
the conveniences and decencies of their


<pb n="430" facs="tcp:42467:241"/>
mortal Lives; they would ſoon have
found them good and acceptable in
their kinds and qualities, received them
at God's Hand with Thankfulneſs, and
poſſeſſed them with eaſe and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in all proportions.</p>
                  <p>And then, all their Complaints of
their uncertainty, tranſiency, and unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,
to make men compleatly Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
would ſoon have been confuted by
ſuch a Vertuous and Religious Mind, as
is reſolved on the greater aims, and that

attaining the Bliſs of a Future State:
To which he knows, that all the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this Life may (one way or
other) be made conſiderably ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient,
notwithſtanding their proclaim'd
and adjudg'd imperfections.</p>
                  <p>Upon which account, when a Good
man once underſtands they were chiefly
given him, and then endeavours only to
uſe them for that end, he will ſoon be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with their enjoyment in every
different degree, and muſt approve
GOD's Wiſdom and Goodneſs in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them, as they are, (whilſt they
ſerve thoſe purpoſes) the Objects of His
preſent Care, Deſire, and Uſage.</p>
                  <p>It is mens eſteeming them too much
their Happineſs, that makes them found


<pb n="431" facs="tcp:42467:241"/>
to be too little, and their uſing them
unworthily, that makes them none at
all.</p>
                  <p>And therefore would men have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
the true notion of their Nature,
and as they are qualified in their proper
kinds, and learn'd, that the uncertainty,
unconſtancy, and unſufficiency to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
mens preſent ſatisfactions in them,
were but the neceſſary and natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
and inſeparable qualities of all
earthly Enjoyments; and then would
have laboured for, received, and relyed
upon them but as ſuch, they had never
underſtood what diſcontent, fruſtration, or
diſappointment had meant; nor ever had
they been tempted to make ſuch paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Complaints againſt them, ſo much
to the diſparagement of the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Order of the Divine Pleaſure and
Providence.</p>
                  <p>They then would have been no more
diſpleaſed with them, becauſe they found
them ſo qualified, than they would think
it reaſonable to be angry with Horſes or
Doggs, becauſe they can't ſpeak to them,
or can't keep their accounts, or will not

                     <pb n="432" facs="tcp:42467:242"/>
Nor would they have thought the
worſe of their Money, that GOD gave
them as a Bleſſing, for many good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
of Life, becauſe it could not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
their minds directly with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

that it could not be its own defence
againſt Loſs and Cheats, or that it would
not be a conſtant Poſſeſſion, when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
threw it away, to ſerve their Pride,
Folly, and Senſualities.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that when the ſilly Worldling
is plaguing himſelf with his inſatiate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of graſping more than will proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuit his needs and conveniences; and
is unkindly crucifying his Mind, becauſe
of this or that diſappointment of greater
improvements; or for the news of ſome
unlucky miſcarriage in his Affairs: The
eaſie Soul of him that hath fix'd his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
and hopes upon a future Happineſs,
(when ſuch things happen to him) is
as unconcern'd as a common Spectator.</p>
                  <p>And when the uncertain turns and
croſs contingences of the World, do keep
the Good man down to a lower Fortune,
he is ſo far from finding Reaſons to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
or complain, that he can frame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
in his own mind, by which he
can repreſent his preſent condition to


<pb n="433" facs="tcp:42467:242"/>
himſelf, whatſoever it is, with the ſame
contentment and ſatisfaction, as if it
were the iſſue of his own choice, and as
if he had carved it out for himſelf, by
the Rules of his own and other mens
moſt deliberate Counſels.</p>
                  <p>And then, if at any time this Good
man hath reaſon to foreſee any approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dangers, to diſturb his preſent order,
he preſently atones his fears with his
greater hopes: And if thoſe dangers do
really come to paſs, it is but treating
his mind with more lively apprehenſions,
and his advancing the expectations of
his future Bliſs to a higher pitch, and
immediately he is diſcharg'd of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
ſenſe of all thoſe interruptions of
his preſent quiet, whatſoever they be.</p>
                  <p>So that he that hath once eſpouſed the
deſigns of, and fix'd his hopes upon the
Happineſs of a future State, will be so
far from permitting himſelf to murmur
or complain, that he will alwaies be
ſtudying to furniſh his mind with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to think, that the nature (ſuch as it
is) of all the outward Enjoyments of
this Life, is moſt approvable, and that
the manner of their diſpenſation is to
the beſt purpoſes, for his preſent and
future Good and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="434" facs="tcp:42467:243"/>
And then alſo he may find Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to believe, that the Great GOD
will one day convince the World, that
His Wiſdom and Goodneſs did in no
part of His Creation, and of His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
courſe of Providence, appear more
illuſtrious, and deſignedly propitious for
the good of Mankind, than that by His
ordination, thoſe their preſent Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhould paſs in the ſame unconſtant
and unſatisfying order, as they ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
do.</p>
                  <p>And that all vain men will one day
be forc'd to acknowledge to their own
ſhame, how many advantages they had
received and rejected, by their admired
Enjoyments univerſal inſufficiency to
give them full contentment, to have in
time attended to better Counſels for
their own good, and to have relied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more certain Hopes and Bleſſings,
for their own happineſs and ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>And, Laſtly, That all Good men, to
GOD's everlaſting Glory, ſhall proclaim
to all the World, that had they not
been convinced by the many changes
and unſatisfactions in their Temporal
Enjoyments of their certain Vanity; and
that they had found no reaſon to expect
any compleat Happineſs from them,
they had neither loved nor valued, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped


<pb n="435" facs="tcp:42467:243"/>
nor endeavoured for the higher
Bleſſings of another World, as they ought
to have done: but might have lived and

loſs of thoſe incomparable Proviſions
for their future Bliſs and Happineſs.

of Birth and Breeding, where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of another World are not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>Then, as to the <hi>Laſt</hi> general reputed
Conſtitutive of humane Proſperity, <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi>
No man knows what's truly ſuch,
but the Vertuous, and the Innocent, and
he that lives in the hopes of a future
Bliſs; he only ſweetly and ſerenely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
it, when the pretended Voluptuary


<pb n="438" facs="tcp:42467:245"/>
ſhall not poſſeſs the leaſt ſhadow of true
ſatisfaction from his ſordid Senſualities.
It is the Temperate that enjoys the true
pleaſure of his Meals, and the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an undiſturbed ſleep; and that
can methodically delight in making an
orderly diſtinction of the Night and
Day, for the ends they were naturally
intended: He drinks Waters out of his
own Ciſtern, and his chaſte Bed is full of
ſweet Love, that bounds his Deſires to his
own ſatisfaction. And if at any time,
his want of Health or Plenty, or the
troubleſome Scene of publick Affairs,
ſhall interrupt the delight he might
have taken in his honeſt Enjoyments,
his Religion can raiſe his mind to a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
that is intellectual; he hath that in
reſerve, by which he can take ſuch a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in his Hopes, that in the midſt
of all his natural ſorrows and ſaddeſt
circumſtances, he can contentedly ſmile
upon the expected Objects of his future
Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Now, from what I have been able
thus to ſay in the inſtant caſe, we are
in Reaſon as well as Duty, prepared to
admire the Mercy of God, and the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of His Goodneſs, that He hath in
His Gracious Care ſo fully provided for
Man's univerſal Happineſs both here and


<pb n="439" facs="tcp:42467:245"/>
hereafter. And this was the Deſign and
Reaſon of our Saviour's Promiſe,<note place="margin">Matt. 6. 33.</note> when
He aſſured all thoſe that would ſeek the
Kingdom of GOD, and His Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
that is, that ſhould direct their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Deſires of being Happy to the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs
of another World, and then ſhould
alwaies endeavour to perſiſt in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
way of living, that tends to it, all
thoſe things, that is, all that concerns
their preſent Happineſs in this World,
ſhall be alſo added to them in the Sence
that I have repreſented it.</p>
                  <p>Thus we may be ſatisfied, that all
that's call'd humane Proſperity in every
part of it, was not given and allowed to
Mankind in this World in vain: It is only
the Evil and the Inconſiderate that makes
it ſo; but Good men may, and do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
enjoy it to as many purpoſes of
Happineſs, as themſelves would deſire
and wiſh for, with reſpect to that of
another World. And they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Three former Arguments,
to prove the inſufficiency of all preſent
Enjoyments for Man's ſummary Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
it was that they never aimed at;
and in that they were never diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
ſo it's evident, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their imperfections, though they could
not make them compleatly Happy, yet


<pb n="440" facs="tcp:42467:246"/>
they might, in other reſpects, make
them really ſo in their kinds in this
preſent Life.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have got over the Third
part of my intended deſign, by which it
may demonſtrably appear, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
Exiſtence and Belief of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State, doth throughly ſolve all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
againſt GOD, for giving Man
naturally ſuch an impatient inclination
and deſire of Happineſs, and againſt all
preſent Enjoyments, becauſe their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
might render them uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of making Man compleatly Happy
in this World.</p>

               <pb n="441" facs="tcp:42467:246"/>
               <head>THE
CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>NOW the <hi>Concluſion</hi> is, becauſe GOD
hath made no other Proviſions in
this mortal State, to give ſatisfaction to
Man's natural Deſires and Appetites of
being Happy, but ſuch as are ſubject to
ſuch imperfections, it neceſſarily follows,
that there muſt be ſuch a Future State
in real Exiſtence, the ſufficiency and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability
of whoſe Bliſs and Happineſs,
ſhould fully anſwer Man's natural Deſires
and Appetites, and become a Bleſſing ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and proportionable to all the lofty Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
of his being a Rational Creature.</p>
               <p>And if all this were not to be conſidered
as infinitely True, but that Man's Being
here were deſigned to be concluded within
the ſhort ſpan and inconſiderable ſpace of
Time, (far exceeded by many Vegetable
and ſenſible Creatures) between his Birth
and Death, and that nothing elſe had been
provided for him, to anſwer the earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his natural Deſire and Appetite of
being Happy, but what is here offered to
his preſent view and poſſeſſion; it were not
too ſevere to think and ſay, that Mankind
(eſpecially as to the far greateſt part of
it) would ſeem to have lived here, to a


<pb n="442" facs="tcp:42467:247"/>
very little better purpoſe, than to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
baffling themſelves with the fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and the deluded Hopes of ſomething
that they could never arrive at, and of a
Happineſs that hath alwaies fled from them
upon their neareſt approaches to it; and
that a great part of the humane World
were never like to be much happier, than
one that is continually toſſed up and down
with the reciprocations of Fears and Hopes,
Expectances and Diſappointments: Or, to
be reſembled by an Hydropick Perſon's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
who is alwaies drinking, and yet
alwaies thirſty, burnt and drown'd at
once.</p>
               <p>Every other Creature, without Senſe of
any defect or diſappointment, neceſſarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
its end: The Brute Animals are
ſatisfied (according to the capacity of their
faculties) with what they are, and what
they have: Only poor Man (upon a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
that there is no Future State) muſt
paſs away his daies in dragging about a
Mill of conſtant Toil, to ſerve his natural
Needs, and to be alwaies a Drudge to his
inferiour Appetites; and then being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with a few Annual Circlings of Care
and Labour through the time of his ſtrength
and vigour, muſt at laſt, in his Age, be
left to languiſh under the Vnhappy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of the fruſtration of all he ſought


<pb n="443" facs="tcp:42467:247"/>
for, and for the little purpoſes, for which
he had ever been reckoned among the
Living.</p>
               <p>How reaſonable then is the Sacred <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation!</hi>
and, How much doth it approve
it ſelf to be Truth, when it declares and
tenders ſuch a Future State of Happineſs,
as may fully anſwer all the Reaſons of
Man's Creation, and that can only be ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
and adapted to his Minds natural
frame and inclinations?</p>
               <p>Had Man's real Happineſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
ſatisfaction been attainable from any
Enjoyment here, (which GOD wiſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
it never ſhould) all the ſuſpicions
that the Modern Atheiſt can alledge, might
with ſome Juſtice be objected againſt the
Scriptures incomparable Manifeſtations of
GOD's Bleſſing to Good Men in another
World.</p>
               <p>But ſince it appears by all Experiences
and univerſal Agreement, that the contrary
is True, I cannot conjecture whence the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
and diſbelief of a Future State, or
the unaccountable neglect of it, by them that
do believe it, ſhould gain ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites,
except it be found among ſuch as
are reſolved to live and die like Fools,
that is, with a brutiſh inconſideration of
any thing that is beyond the preſent ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
of their Senſes; or among ſuch, who


<pb n="444" facs="tcp:42467:248"/>
deſperately purpoſing to live debauched
Lives, can no otherwiſe avoid the Reproach
of being the moſt Irrational Creatures in
the World, but by endeavouring to hector
down the Belief, or at leaſt the Concern of
a Future State, and the dreadful Thoughts
of a Following Account.</p>
