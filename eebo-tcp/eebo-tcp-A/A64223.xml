         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALL that is intended in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
is to acquaint thee with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
that is both portable and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
of no great price, easie carriage, yet
of a speedy and Accurate dispatch in the
most difficult Problems in Astronomy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The lines for the most part have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
published by Mr. <hi>Gunter,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

from the reverend Mr. <hi>Palmers</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Planisphere. Many of the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Treatise of Dyalling are taken
from (though first compared with the
Globe) my worthy Friend (to whom I am
indebted in all the Obligations of Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and without whose encouragement this
had never adventured the publick Test)
Mr. <hi>John Collins.</hi> The applying Mr.
<hi>Fosters</hi> Line of Versed Sines unto the
Sector was first published by Mr. <hi>John
<pb facs="tcp:37465:3"/>
Brown,</hi> Mathematical Instrument-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
at the Sphere and Sun-Dial in the
<hi>Minories, London, Anno 1660.</hi> who
bath very much assisted me, by making,
adding unto, and giving me freely the
perusal of many Instruments, according
to any directions for Improvement, that
was proposed to him. After this account,
what hath been my part in this Work, I
hazard to thy censure; and when I see
others publish a more convenient, speedy,
accurate, and general Instrument, I assure
them to have as low thoughts of this, as
themselves. But here is so large a Catalogue
of <hi>Errata's</hi> as would stagger my confidence
at thy pardoning, had they not been ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocably
committed before I received the
least notice of them. The Printer writing
me word (after I had corrected so much
as came to my sight) that he could alter
no Mistakes until the whole Book was
printed: By which means he enforced me
to do pennance in his Sheets, for his own
Crimes: Did not one gross mistake of his
become my purgation, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>lib. 2.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:37465:3"/>
(throughout Chap. <hi>3.</hi>) where instead of
the note of equality (marked thus =) he
hath inserted the Algebraick note of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
or Minoration (marked thus -)</p>
            <p>Nor hath the Engraver come behinde
the Composer, who so miserably mangleth
Fig. <hi>13.</hi> that (at first sight) it would
endanger branding of a mans Brains to
spell the meaning thereof, either in it self,
or in reference to the Book. All that I can
help thee herein, is this; Whereas the Book
mentions that Figure for an East Dyal, if
you account it (as now cut) a West Dyal,
and alter the names of the hours, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Figures for the afternoon, in the place
of those there for the morning; you will
then have a true West Dyal of that Figure.</p>
            <p>The correction of Punctations would be
an endless task; for I finde some to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
ever since <hi>Valentine,</hi> to recreate
themselves at <hi>Spurn-point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What other material mistakes are in the
Book (which ought to be corrected before
reading thereof) you will finde mentioned
in the <hi>Errata.</hi> Farewel.</p>

                     <p>A Description of the Instrument, with the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Lines inscribed thereon.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Instrument consists of three Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
or Pieces; two whereof are
joyned together by a River that may
open and shut to any Angle, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of the Sector; or to use a courser com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
after the manner of Compasses. The
third piece is loose, or separable from them,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37465:6"/>
to be put into the Tenons at the end of the
inward ledge of the joyned pieces, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
constituting an aequilateral triangle.</p>
                  <p>On these Rulers (after this manner put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
we take notice (for distinction sake)
of the sides, ledges, ends, and pieces.</p>
                  <p>The sides are thus differenced, one we call
the quadrantal, the other the proportional,
or sector side.</p>
                  <p>The ledges are distinguished by naming
one the inward, the other the outward
ledge.</p>
                  <p>The ends are known in terming one the
head (<hi>viz.</hi> where the two pieces are riveted
together) the other the end.</p>
                  <p>The pieces are discovered by styling one
the fixed piece, <hi>viz.</hi> that which hath the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
upon it; the second the movable piece,
which turns upon that rivet, and the last the
loose piece, to be put into the tenons, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expressed.</p>
                  <p>The quadrantal side of the joyned pieces
is easily discerned, having the names of the
Moneths stamped on the movable piece, and
Par. Scale on the fixed piece. The quadrantal
side of the loose piece is known by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

the lines upon the quadrantal side are
these.</p>
                  <p>First on the fixed piece, next the outward
limb, is a line of 12 equal parts; and each of
those parts divided into 30 degrees, marked
from the end towards the head with ♈ ♉ ♊,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> representing the 12 Signs of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack;
the use of this line, with the help of
those under it, was intended to find the hour
of the night by the Moon.</p>
                  <p>The next line to this is a line of twice 12,
or 24 equal parts, each division whereof cuts
every 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree of the former line: and
therefore if the figures were set to every 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
degree on this side the former line, this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
line would be useless, and the former
perform its office more distinctly. This line
was intended an assistant for finding the hour
by the Moon; but is very ready to find the
hour by any of the fixed Stars.</p>
                  <p>The third line is a line of 29<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> equal parts,
serving for the dayes of the Moons age; in
order to find the hour of the night by the
Moon. But the operation is so tedious, and
far from exactness, that I have no kindness
for it; and should place some other lines in
the room of this and the former, did I not
resolve to impose upon no mans phantasie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:37465:7"/>The fourth line is a line of altitudes for a
particular latitude, noted at the end, Par.
Scale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This helpeth to find the hour and
azimuth of the Sun, or any fixed Star very
exactly.</p>
                  <p>The fifth line is a line of natural sines; at
the beginning whereof there is a pin, or else
an hole to put a pin into, whereon to hang
the thread and plummet for taking of alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.
To this line of sines may be joyned a
line of tangents to 45 degr. The use of the
sines alone, is to work proportions in signs.
The use of the sines with the tangent line may
be for any proportion in trigonometry; but
that I leave to liberty.</p>
                  <p>The sixth line, and last on this side the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

from the centre at the head to 180 at the

                  <p>On the quadrantal side of the movable
piece, the first line next the inward edge, is
a line of versed sines answering to that on the
fixed piece. The use of these versed sines is
various at pleasure.</p>
                  <p>The second line from the inward edge, is a
line of hours and Azimuths serving to find
the hour by the Sun or Stars, or the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth

                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:37465:7"/>The third and fourth lines are lines of
Moneths, marked with the respective names,
and each Moneth divided into so many parts
as it contains dayes.</p>
                  <p>The fifth line is a line of signs marked ♈ Taurus; Gemini;,
 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> each sign being divided into 30
degr. and proceeding from ♈, or <hi>Aries</hi>(which
answers to the tenth of <hi>March)</hi> in the same
order as the Moneths. The use of this line,
with help of the Moneths, is to find the Suns
place in the Zodiack.</p>
                  <p>The sixth line is a line of the Suns right
ascension, commonly noted by hours from
00 to 24. but better if divided by degrees
or sines from 00 to 360, and both wayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
backward and forward as the signs
of the Zodiack, or dayes of the Moneth.</p>
                  <p>Lastly the outward edge or limb of the
movable and loose piece both, is graduated
unto 180 degrees, or two quadrants; whose
centre is the pin, or pin-hole before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
at the beginning of the sines on this
side the fixed piece. The perpendicular
is at 0/60 upon the loose piece; from
whence reckoning along the outward edge
of the loose piece, till it intersects the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
line of sines at the end of the fixed
piece, you have 90 degrees. Or counting
from 0/60 on the loose piece, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

it along the degrees of the outward limb
of the movable piece, until they intersect the
produced line of sines on the fixed piece at
the head, you have again 90 degrees, which
compleat the Semicircle. The use of this
line is for taking of altitudes, counting upon
the former 90. degr. when you hold the head
of the fixed piece toward the Sun: and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
upon this latter, when you hold (which
is best because the degrees are largest) the
end of the fixed piece toward the Sun. There
are other wayes of numbring these degrees
for finding of the Azimuth,<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which shall
be mentioned in their proper places.</p>
                  <p>On the quadrantal side of the loose piece,
the inward edge or limb is graduated unto
60 degrees (or twice 30, which you please)
whose centre is a pin at the head. The use of
this is to find the altitude of the Sun, or any
Star, without thread and plummet; or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
some uses of the Cross-staff. This is
for large rules or instruments, and therefore
not illustrated here.</p>
                  <p>In the empty spaces upon the quadrantal
side may be engraven the names of some fixed
Stars, with their right ascensions and decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>

The line that lies next the inward edge
on the fixed piece hath his fellow or corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent

                  <p>The lines issuing from the centre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the outward edge of the movable

                  <p>The lines issuing from the centre next the
inward edge of the movable piece, whose

                  <p>On the inward ledge of the loose piece

                     <p>IF you be to lay down a Sine, enter the

the given Radius in 45, and 45, on the

the Rule. But when the Tangent required
exceeds 45. enter the Radius given in 45, and

in manner of Chords. Then having drawn the
line A B at any distance of your Compass, set
one point in B, and draw a mark to intersect
the Line B A, as E F. Enter this distance B
F in 30, and 30 upon the Lines of Sines, and
keeping the Sector at that Gage, take out
the Sine of half the Angle required, and
setting one point where F intersects B A,
turn the other toward E, and make the mark
E, with a ruler draw B E and the Angle E B F
is the Angle required, which here is 40. d.</p>
                     <p>A second method by the lines of Sines is
thus, Enter B A Radius in the Lines of Sines,
and keeping the Sector at that Gage, take out
the Sine of your Angle required with that
distance, setting one point of your Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in A, sweep the ark D, a line drawn from
B by the connexity of the Ark D, makes the
Angle A B C 40 d. as before.</p>
                     <p>To protract an Angle by the Lines of Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
is easily done, draw B A the Radius
upon A, erect a perpendicular, A C, enter
B A in 45, and 45 on the Lines of Tangents,
and taking out the Tangent required (as here
40) set it from A to C. Lastly, draw B C, and
the Angle C B A is 40 d. as before.</p>
                     <p>In case you would protract an Angle by
the Lines of Secants. Draw B A, and upon
A erect the perpendicular A C, enter A B in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37465:23"/>
the beginning of the Lines of Secants, and
take out the Secant of the Angle, with that

account the third term on both lines from the

                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:37465:23"/>As the Radius is to the Sine 30, so is the

and that is when the second term is greater

                     <p>But when the second term is not twice

                     <p>And by consequent, when the third term
is greater than the first, provided it be not

may be wrought by transposing the terms,
although the second was twice the length of
the first. Ex. gr.</p>
                     <p>As the Sine 20 is to the Sine 60, so is the

                     <p>SUppose A B a Line given to be divided
into nine equal parts. Enter A B in 9,
and 9 on the lines of lines, keeping the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
at that gage, take the distance from 8,
on one side, to 8 on the other, and apply it
from A upon the line A B, which reacheth
to C; then is C B a ninth part of the line
A B. By this means you may divide any line
(that is not more than the Instrument in
length) into as many parts as you please, <hi>viz.</hi>
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 500, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> parts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37465:25"/>
twenty parts more. Again, if the line re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
a 1000, then every figured division
is 100, the second or shorter division is 10,
and the third or shortest division is 5. In
case the whole line was 2000, then every
figured division is 200, every smaller or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
division is 20, every third or smallest
division is 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Suppose I have any line
given, which is the base of a Triangle, whose
content is 2000 poles, and I demand so much
of the Base as may answer 1750 poles. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the whole line in 10, and 10 at the end
of the lines of lines, and keep the Sector at
that gage. Now the whole line representing
2000 poles, every figured division is 200;
therefore 1700 is eight and an half of the
figured divisions, and 50 is five of the smallest
divisions more (for in this case every smallest
division is 10, as was before expressed)
wherefore setting one point of the Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in 15 of the smallest divisions beyond 8
on the Rule. I extend the other point to the
same division upon the line on the other side,
and that distance is 1750 poles in the base of
the Triangle proposed. How ready this is to
set out a just quantity in any plat of ground,
I shall shew in a Scheam, Chap. 12.</p>

To finde 79 on the line of numbers, count

is the point for that number. Now as the

so is every one of those parts subdivided (so

40 min. with distance, setting one point
in 65. turn the other toward 45, and you
will finde it reach beyond it, which assures

take the distance from that point to 65, and
laying that distance from 45 toward the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

for round Timber, as the point R. on the

square instead of the girt, and the point Sq.
instead of the point R. At 30 foot in length, 7

                  <p>THe Line of inches and foot measure do
by inspection (only) reduce either of
the measures into the other. Ex. gr. Three
on the line of inches stands directly against

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37465:40"/>
foot measure is directly against 9 on the

                  <p>Another use of these lines (welcome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to them that delight in instrumental

                  <p>For this purpose, the line of inches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
the price of a pound, every inch
being a penny, and every quarter a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
The prickt line is the price of an

the hundred, every division signifying a
shilling.</p>
                  <p>The line of foot measure is the price of
an hundred pound at five score to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
every division standing for a shilling.
Ex. gr.</p>
                  <p>At 3 pence the pound on the inches, is
28 shillings on the prickt line, and 25 shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
on the foot measure, for the price of
an hundred, the like for the converse. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
the price of a pound being given, the
rate of an hundred is readily computed
without the rule. For considering the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of farthings is in the price of a pound,
twice that number of shillings, and once that
number of pence, is the price of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
reckoning five score to the hundred;
of twice that number of shillings, and once
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37465:41"/>
that number of groats, is the price of an
hundred, at five score and twelve to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
Ex. gr. At three half pence the pound,
the number of farthings is six. Therefore,
twice six shillings, and once six pence (that
is 125. 6d.) is the price of an hundred, at
five score to the hundred. Again, twice six
shillings, and once six groats (that is 14s.)
is the price of an hundred, at five score and
twelve to the hundred. But of this enough,
if not too much already.</p>

                     <p>Some uses of the Instrument in Navigation, or plain Salling.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HEre it will be necessary to premise the
explication of some terms, and adjoyn
two previous proportions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Compass being a circle, divided
into 32 equal parts, called rumbs; one point
or rumb is 11 d. 15 min. of a circle from the
meridian: two points or rumbs is 22 d. 30
min. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the rest.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The angle which the needle, or point of
the compass under the needle, makes with
the meridian, or North and South line is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the course or rumb; but the angle
which it makes with the East, and West line,
or any parallel, is named the complement of
the course or rumb.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The departure is the longitude of that
Port from which you set sail.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The distance run, is the number of
miles, or leagues (turned into degrees) that
you have sailed.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:37465:44"/>
5. When you are in North latitude, and
sail North-ward, adde the difference of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to the latitude you sailed from; and
when you are in North latitude, and sail
Southward, subtract the difference of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
from the latitude you sailed, and you
have the latitude you are in.</p>
                  <p>The same rule is to be observed in South
latitude.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To finde how many miles answer to one
degree of longitude in any latitude.</p>
                  <p>As the radius is to the number 60, so is the
cosine of the latitude to the number of miles
for one degree.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To finde how many miles answer to one
degree of latitude on any rumb.</p>
                  <p>As the cosine of the rumb from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
is to the number 60, so is the radius
to the number of miles.</p>
                  <p>The most material questions in Navigation
are these four.</p>
                  <p>First, To finde the course. Secondly, The
distance run. Thirdly, The difference of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.
Fourthly, The difference in longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
and any two of these being given, the
other two are readily found by the Square
and Index.</p>
                  <p>These two additional rulers were omitted
in the first Chapter of this Treatise; sith
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37465:45"/>
they are only for Navigation, and large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of two, or three foot in length,
which made me judge their description most
proper for this place: because, such as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Instrument for a pocket companion,
will have no use of them.</p>
                  <p>The square is a flat rule, having a piece,
or plate fastened to the head, that it may
slide square, or perpendicular to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ledge of the fixed piece. It hath the
same line next either edge on the upper side,
which is a line of equal parts, an hundred,
wherein is equal to the radius of the degrees
on the outward limb of the moveable piece.</p>
                  <p>The Index is a thin brass rule on one side,
having the same scale as the square. On the
other side is a double line of tangents, that
next the left edge, being to a smaller; that
next the right edge, to a larger radius.</p>
                  <p>For the use of these rulers, you must have
a line of equal parts adjoyning to the line of
sines on the fixed piece, divided into 10
parts, stamped with figures, each of those
divided into 10 parts more; so that the
whole line is divided into 100 parts, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
degrees. Lastly, let each of those
degrees be sub-divided into as many parts,
as the largeness of your scale will permit,
for computing the minutes of a degree.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:37465:45"/>The Index is to move upon the pin on the
fixed piece (where you hang the thread for
taking altitudes) and that side of the Index
(in any of the four former questions) must
be upward, which hath the scale of equal
parts.</p>
                  <p>The square is to be slided along the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ledge of the fixed piece. Then the
general rules are these.</p>
                  <p>The difference of latitude is accounted
on the line of equal parts, adjoyning to the
sines on the fixed piece.</p>
                  <p>The difference of longitude is numbred
on the square.</p>
                  <p>The distance run is reckoned upon the
Index.</p>
                  <p>The course is computed upon the degrees
on the limb from the head toward the end of
the moveable piece.</p>
                  <p>But when any would work these Problems
in proportions, let them note,</p>
                  <p>The distance run, difference of longitude,
and difference of latitude, are all accounted
on the line of numbers; the rumb or course
is either a sine or tangent.</p>
                  <p>This premised. I shall first shew how to
resolve any Problem by the square and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex;
and next adjoyn the proportions for the
use of such as have only pocket Instruments.</p>

                     <p>For this purpose the tangent lines on the
index will be a ready help, using the lesser
for small, and the greater tangent line, for
great latitudes. The way is thus,</p>
                     <p>Account the pont 60/0, on the outward
limb of the moveable piece to be the point,
or port of your departure; thereto lay the
fiducial edge of the index, and reckoning
the latitude of the Port you departed from
upon the index, strike a pin directly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37465:48"/>
it, into the table your instrument lies
upon. This pin shall represent the Port of
your departure. Therefore hanging a thread,
or hair, on the center, whereon the index
moves; and winding it about this pin. Count
the difference of longitude 'twixt the port of
your departure, and the Port you sail to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
from 60/0 on the moveable piece to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
0/60, on the loose piece; and thereto
laying the same fiducial edge of the index,
reckon the latitude of this last Port upon the
index, directly touching of it, strike down
another pin upon the table, and draw the
thread strait about this pin fastening it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
This done, the thread betwixt the two
pins represents the ark of your great Circle;
and laying the fiducial edge of the index to
any degree of difference of longitude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
from 60/0 on the moveable piece,
the thread shows upon the index what lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
you are in, and how much you have
raised, or depressed the pole since your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.
On the contrary, laying the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
you are in (numbred upon the index)
to the thread, the index shows the difference

               <p>THe sights which are necessary for taking
any Altitude. Angle, or distance
(without the help of Thread or Plummet)
are only three, <hi>viz.</hi> one turning sight, and
two other sights, contrived with chops, so
that they may slide by the inward or outward
graduated limbs. The turning sight hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two places, either the center at the head,
or the center at the beginning of the line of
sines on the fixed piece; to either of which
(as occasion requires) its fastened with a
sorne. The center at the head serving for
the graduations next the inward limb of the
loose piece. And the center at the beginning
of the line of sines serving for all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duations
next the outward limb of the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and loose piece both. Yet because it is
requisite to have pins to keep the loose
piece close in its place. You may have two
sights more to supply their place (which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37465:54"/>
sometimes you may make use of) and so the
number of sights may be five, <hi>viz.</hi> two sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
sights, one turning sight, and two pin
sights, to put into the holes at the end of the
fixed and moveable piece, to hold the tenons
of the loose piece close joynted. Every one of
these sights hath a fiducial (or perpendicular)
line, drawn down the middle of them, from
the top to the bottom, where this line touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the graduations on the limb, is the point
of observation.</p>
               <p>The places of these sights have an oval
proportion, about the middle of them,
only leaving a small bar of brass, to conduct
the fiducial line down the oval cavity, and
support a little brass knot (with a sight hole
in it) in the middle of that bar, which is ever
the point to be looked at. There are two
wayes of observing an altitude with help
of these sights. The one when we turn our
face toward the object. This is called a
forward observation in which you must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
set the turning sight next your eye.
This way of observation will not exactly
give an altitude above 45 degrees.</p>
               <p>The other way of observing an altitude is
peculiar to the Sun in a bright day, when
we turn our back toward the Sun. This is
termed a backward observation; wherein
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37465:55"/>
You must have one of the sliding sights next
Your eye, and the turning sight toward the
Horizon. This serves to take the Suns al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

                     </p>
                     <p>The manner of
drawing this Table is
thus. The inclination
of Meridians (which
because its a North
decliner, is twelve at
midnight.) I finde
76. d. 30. min. Now
considering the Sun
never riseth till more
than half an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
three in this lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
I know that one
quarter before four is
the first line proper for
this plain: Therefore
reckoning 15. d. for
an hour, or 3. d. 45. m.
for a quarter of an
hour, I finde three
hours, three quarters
(the distance of a
quarter before four
from midnight) to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
56. d. 15. min.
which being subtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from 76. d. 30. min.
the inclination of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians
there remains
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:37465:71"/>
20. d. 15. m. for the distance of one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before four from the substyle. Again,
from 20. d. 15. min. subtract 3. d. 45. min.
(the quantity of degrees for one quarter of
an hour) and there remains 16. d. 30. min.
for the distance of the next line from the
substyle, which is the hour of four in the
morning. Thus for every quarter of an hour
continue subtracting 3. d. 45. min. until your
residue or remain be less than 3. d. 45. min.
and then first subtracting that residue out of
3. d. 45. min. This new residue gives the
quantity of degrees for that line on the other
side the substyle. Now when you are passed
to the other side of the substyle, continue
adding 3. d. 45. min. to this last remain for
every quarter of an hour, and so make up the
table for what hours are proper to the plain.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Draw the square ABCD. of what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
the plain will admit, and make the angle
CAG equal to the angle of the substyle with
twelve. Again, cross the line AG. in any
two convenient points, as E. and F. at right
angles by the lines KL. and CM.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Take the distance from the center unto
45. the radius to the lesser lines of tangents,
which is continued to 76. on the Sector side,
enter this distance in 45. on the larger lines
of tangents, and keeping the Sector at that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:37465:71"/>
gage, take out the tang. 20. d. 15. min.
(which is the distance of the first line from
the substyle) set this from 73. d. 30. min.
(the distance of your last hour line from the
substyle, as you see by the Table) toward
the end upon the lesser line of tangents, and
where it toucheth as here at 75. 05. call
that the gage tangent.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Enter the whole line KL. in the gage
tangent, which in this example is 75. d. 05.
min. and keeping the Sector at that gage,
take out the tangent 73. 30. min. which is
your last hour, and set from L. on the line
KL. unto V. Again, take out the tangent
20. d. 15. min. which is your first line, and
set it from K. towards V. and if it meet in V.
it proves the truth of your work, and a line
drawn through V. paralel unto AG. is the
true substyle line. Then keeping the Sector
at its former gage, set off the tangents of
the hours, and quarters (as you finde them
in the Table) from V. towards K. and from V.
towards L. making points for them in the line
KL. Lastly, enter the radius of your tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
to these hour points in the radius of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,
and set off the secant of the styles
height from V. to T. Thus have you the
hour points and style on one line of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
To mark them out upon the other line
do thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:37465:72"/>Set the radius to the hour points upon the
former line of contingence, from h. to p.
on the line ChM. and entring hV. as Radius
in the line of tangents, take out the tangent
of the styles height, and set from p. to r.
Again, enter hr. radius in your line of tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
and keeping the Sector at that gage,
take out the tangents for each hour, and
quarter, according to the table, and lay them
down from h. to the proper side of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>style
toward C. or M. and applying a ruler
to the respective points on KL. and CM.
draw the lines for the hours and quarters.
Lastly, enter hr. radius on the lines of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,
and taking out the secant of the styles
height, set it from h. to S. and draw the line
ST. for the style.</p>
