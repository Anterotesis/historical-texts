            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. The many mischiefs and inconveniences which
may happen by an Act of Parliament, to be
made for the more speedy recovery of Debts
upon Bonds or Bills, under the Debtors
hands and seals, in the manner as is by some
desired.</head>
            <p>THe Suggestions and that which should
be the Causes or inducements to such
an Act of Parliament are greatly mistaken;
or if there happen any such Evils as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
they are <hi>Raro Contingentia,</hi> and do
but seldom happen.</p>
            <p>And when they do arise, have their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
from other Causes, but not from Arrests
in Actions of Debt, which by the shortest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
are and have been of 374. years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
by order and approbation of many
Acts of Parliament, but may be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have been of a far greater Age, and
equal to that of the Eldest Court or <hi>Method</hi>
of Justice, in this, or any other civilized Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98392:6"/>
The mischances happening by two or three
Bailiffs in 20. or 30, jears, killed most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
upon the score of their own provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
rudeness and misdemeanors, are when they
do so happen in the unruly Suburbs of <hi>London</hi>
towards <hi>Westminster,</hi> for in the other too vast
extent of them, an Age or Century is scarce
able to furnish out one of those evil accidents.</p>
            <p>And within the City of <hi>London,</hi> where Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
seems to be the Life and Soul of Trade,
and their growing, and already gained Riches
there may be reckoned in their two Sheriffs
Courts twice every week in the Year, holden
no less than two hundred Actions and Arrests
weekly, entered and made upon Debts which
makes no more disturbance than a quiet put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in of Bail, which secures the Debt more
than it was before.</p>
            <p>And in all the Counties, Cities, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> as well as in
the City of <hi>London,</hi> the death of a Bailiff,
Serjeant at Mace or Catchpole, is not to be
found in the remembrance of the most aged
persons.</p>
            <p>And the Writs and Records of the Courts
of <hi>Westminster,</hi> from which very many Writs
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98392:6"/>

cannot shew any frequency of Writs of
<hi>Rescues,</hi> or any assaults made upon the Sheriffs
or their Bayliffs, in the Execution of them.</p>
            <p>And if the Proposers of this Bill and great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the Laws, will not think themselves
to be prejudiced if they should speak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Truth, and what every man upon
the visible evidence of demonstration and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
may rationally believe.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but if there be in one
County or City <hi>two Thousand</hi> Writs or Actions
of Debt, made out in a year to Arrest, not
above five hundred of them do proceed
or come to Appearance, and that of that <hi>five
hundred</hi> unagreed, there are scarce <hi>half</hi> of them
that are declared against, or make any defence,
and not <hi>half</hi> of that <hi>half</hi> ever come to be tryed,
and that those do also most commonly come
to an end or determination.</p>
            <p>Where there is no Demurrers, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of difficulty in Law, or peevishness in some
of the parties to occasion the contrary,
within less than a third Term, that many
thousands of Actions are both in the Superior
courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and the Country and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98392:7"/>
court Barons, and the inferior Courts, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
within a few days, weeks, or months,
very many in a quarter of a year, and those
that remain uncompounded and undispatched,
do not survive the contention or trouble of half
a year after the Suit commenced or begun.</p>
            <p>So that all things considered, if the Laws
and <hi>Praxis</hi> in <hi>Scotland, France, Spain, Germany,
Italy, Holland, Brabant,</hi> and all the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Provinces of the Christian world,
civil and municipal, shall be rightly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with our more happy, less troublesome, and
chargable, they will not be found to afford to
their people such a quick dispatch of Justice
adaequate, and ready way unto it as ours have
done, and will always do, if they be not turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of their old course and channel.</p>
            <p>By an Invention now proposed, which will be
as illegal as unparallel'd, and hath no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
or pattern then that late way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Actions of <hi>Ejectment</hi> hatched in the level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or <hi>Oliverian</hi> times, and hath then and ever
since amongst knowing and good men, gained
no better an esteem then that of a publick grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and a <hi>monstrum horrendum informe ingens
cui lumen ademptum,</hi> spawned and bred up in

a Rebellion, when Monarchy was Banished,
and the word of God and Laws of the Land
were shamefully, and as much as they could,
be misused.</p>
            <p>For that there is an absurdity, confusion,
and <hi>Hysteron Proteron</hi> in it, putting the Cart
before the Horse, and making a Declaration
which should be after a summons Executed,
and Appearance entred to precede the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and at the same time go along with the
Summons, with a prefixion but from one
Terme to the next, which betwixt <hi>Easter</hi>
and <hi>Trinity</hi> Terme, being but with an Interval
of seventeen days, Sundays not excepted, will
be too short, peremptory, and prejudicial to
Defendants, and in the <hi>Lent</hi> Vacation, which
is commonly three Months, and the Summer
Vacation which is never less than 15 weeks,
and sometimes longer, may be as inconvenient
to Plaintiffs, who by the ancient and more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
prefixions, with the small distance of time
of 15 days from return to return, in the Term
time might sooner have recovered their Debts,
appoints no Tryal by Juries, nor declares
by what certain Authority or Court the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
shall be made, whether by the Parties,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98392:8"/>
Plaintiffs, or otherwise, and gives a promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
Conusance of Pleas to all the Courts of
Law at <hi>Westminster,</hi> when as all but the court
of Common Pleas, (some cases of priviledge
excepted) have by our ancient Laws, and
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> no jurisdiction or right therein.</p>
            <p>Makes the <hi>Summons</hi> for a time to come to
falsifie the <hi>Declaration</hi> if at the same time deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd

made, and the <hi>Declaration</hi> which supposeth
it to be already made, and is and ought to
be a copy of the Record in the Court where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Action is pretended to be laid, and
intended to be Tryed; to say he was Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
when he was not, the <hi>Fieri</hi> to be a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi>
and the future to be a <hi>past</hi> or <hi>present,</hi> and
will create some contradictions when the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
defendant shall come to wage his law, make
<hi>Affidavit</hi> of a <hi>non Summons,</hi> or bring his action
for damages sustained by a false <hi>Affidavit</hi> or
returne</p>
            <p>And will be sure enough to produce as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
effects of causes, very many not easie to

and inconveniences.</p>

the best of Governments, and less arbitrary in

for above one <hi>Thousand</hi> years been built and
established, and cut and canton both it and our
well tempered Monarchy into little pieces, and
bring them as near as may be to an unhappy

the good of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Deform, or almost annihilate our long ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

of our Laws, as they Publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed

any Attorney that should practice in such a
manner.</p>
            <p>And with great authority and warrant of
our Lawes, and right reason, for that as it was
justly and truely said by the Judges in the
Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, that <hi>non sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitus

non potest,</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi> an approved Lawyer
in the Reign of that King, and King <hi>Edward</hi>
the second his Son hath published it to be a
great and known Truth, that the Court of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

and that without it, <hi>nec Warrantum nec Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionem

did then and long after not proceed upon such
warrant or commission until the Plaintiff
had actually given sureties to prosecute and
maintain his action, and the Sheriff to whom
such original Writ was directed, for to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or attach the debtor to appear before the
said justices had returned that he was sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
or attached as the nature of the Action

            <p>When but a few years preceding, that well

that excellent, most just, lawdable, and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
course of justice had been endeavoured to
have been subverted by one <hi>Elsliot</hi> of a degree
betwixt an Attorney and a Barrister, and a man
very bold &amp; able enough to make and contrive
tricks and abuses in Law proceedings, who
having about the middle of the reign of King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr as a <hi>Reprobate</hi> and <hi>Cast away</hi>
in the Law shifted himself from <hi>England</hi> into
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and from thence after some bad prancks
there played returning back again with as
much poverty as impudence attending upon
him, and having a desire to get some
money by a contrivance, to gain a sudaine
possession of some Lands or houses for one as
bad as himself, upon a judgment by default
against the Landlord or his Tenant who were
to know nothing of it, caused a declaration to
be prepared in an action of Ejectment against
a feigned Def<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. or ejector in the name of a feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Lessee upon a short Lease pretended to be
made by his naughty Clyent, and left at the
house of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98392:13"/>
Tenant, who not well apprehending the force
and extent of the project, a judgment by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
was entred, possession surprized and taken
for which upon complaint made to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of the Court of Kings Bench, in which
Court the action was supposed to have been
laid, and examination of the fact, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was made void, possession restored, and
Master <hi>Elsliot</hi> the contriver, committed and told
by Justice <hi>Barkley,</hi> that it was <hi>a shame that ever

            </p>
            <p>Howsoever getting himself afterwards enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the confusion and troubles of the late
civil Warrs disturbing and breaking in upon
the Law and all the Courts of Justice,
Mr. <hi>Elsliot;</hi> began again to appear to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body,
&amp; engages in another exploit, which was
to gain by the like device, accompanied with
force &amp; some other naughty ways, possession of
an house and a very considerable estate in Lands
in the County of <hi>Essex</hi> of Sir. <hi>Adam Littletons</hi>
the Father of Sir <hi>Thomas Littleton</hi> Knight, now
a member of the house of Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

to extricate and free himself and
his Fathers Estate from the peril and danger of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98392:14"/>
such a villany, may well remember that a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
record was in that pretended suit privat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
layd in the office of the Records in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>London,</hi> sworn unto, and offered to be
justified, but was at length taken as it ought
to be for a Roguish piece of Forgery, and Sir
<hi>Adam Littleton</hi> and his Estate freed from any
further disturbance.</p>
            <p>Whilst that no smal parcel of Knavery being
in great respect with the Agitators of the then
called Parliament Army, <hi>Levellers</hi> &amp; other <hi>State

            <p>From which reasonless and ungodly <hi>formula</hi>
or way of proceeding, rather to be exploded
then embraced in actions of Ejectment, and so
utterly against the Law (evil examples being
oftner followed then good) by some of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selites
and the connivance or want of courage in
some of the Judges, in the time of the <hi>Cromwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
usurpation, <hi>dum sui non fuerunt,</hi> knowing
better, but doing worse, the same came again to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98392:14"/>
be revived, and creep into an allowance, with a
note indorced by the Attorney in the name of
the <hi>incognito</hi> or casual ejector, directed to the
Tenant or Landlord, requiring them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
and look to the action, and confess <hi>Lease
Ouster</hi> and <hi>Entry,</hi> otherwise he must and would
confess a judgment, or let it pass by default.</p>
            <p>As if such a judgment acknowledged by
practice and confederacy, could not with a
great deal of ease have been reversed by a court
that should not be so abused, and the parties
contrivant severely punished.</p>
            <p>Of which kind of irregularity in the Law<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and wandring out of the <hi>old Paths,</hi> never to be
justified, the Justices of the court of Kings-bench

Many Tradesmen do only subsist by their
credits, and take up great sums of money upon
an opinion of their present abilities, or future
gain, by which they do commonly give no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
security then their Persons, and by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
therof do many times by their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
attain unto great Estates, but if the process
of arrest be taken away, they can hope no
more to be so easily entrusted, for that an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
of the person doth secure the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs
debt, either by present payment or causing
other satisfaction, which the proceedings by
summons in this manner will never attain unto.</p>
            <p>The fear and disgrace of a Process of Arrest
do put a period to many suits before the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
be attached, and before apparance, for that
as a man will give all for his Life, so he will
do much for his Liberty, and when men will
either not regard a Summons, or delay to give
satisfaction or an apparance, they will make
a great deal more hast to prevent an arrest.</p>
            <p>Debtors are several times or often called
upon by their Creditors, which is asmuch as
a Summons made without a Legal Officer,
but yet neither that nor a VVrit of summons
doth drive the most of them, to any care of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98392:18"/>
payment, until the Process of Arrest do issue
forth, which is more compulsory, and will be
sure to prove a more speedy remedy for the
Creditors then the way of Summons.</p>
            <p>And a large and long experience <hi>consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su
rectae rationis &amp; totius antiquitatis,</hi> and many
ages will evidence that the benefit of the process
of arrest hath been very great to this Nation,
and that the care and wisdom of several Statutes
and acts of Parliament who have always provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the publick before the private, universals
before particulars, believed certainties before
incertainties, and long and never failing experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
before remote probabilities, and have
from time to time given a larger extent unto it
then before it had, may tell us that for many
ages past it hath been the best remedie for
the people to recover their debts, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
other differences that our forefathers in
some hundreds of years last past could devise.</p>
            <p>And that to give the force of an <hi>Utlary</hi> after

return out of them into the plain roads

there is a haste of the getting in the mony, or
there is a <hi>suspitio fugae,</hi> or his insufficiency, or a

            <p>When if all the People of the Nation were

            <p>6. Or of no Estate but what they carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with them, or hope for by their Friends,
or their Industry, or some future preferment.</p>
            <p>7. Such whose Estates depend upon their daily
labours, or profits arising thereby, as mechanicks
Artificers, Servants, Labourers, and the like.</p>
            <p>8. Mariners, and a sort of adventitious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who have little or no abode, going or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to or from beyond the Seas, Merchants,
Strangers, and the like.</p>
            <p>Of all which several sorts of people, the Free-holders
and first <hi>Classis</hi> are the only men, who
are properly to be summoned, or to be within
this new proposed Law, because they have lands
&amp; Estates to be known, and thereby summoned,
and are to be found with some certainty, but are
not the fortieth part of those which have not.</p>
            <p>Of the second sort, the Copy-hold Estates,
which being very near a fifth part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are not extendable or liable to debts, nor
can without manifest prejudice to the Lords of
the Manors, whose Predecessors or Ancestors
did under certain Limitations permit them to
enjoy them, be made to be so; Tithes are for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98392:26"/>
the most part not distrainable, and may be sold
or compounded for before they be due, Leases
may be surrended or assigned, so as none shall
easily find the true Proprietor, Annuities or
Rent-Charges are not extendable.</p>
            <p>The third and fourth sort, may either convey
away their Goods, or have very little of them.</p>
            <p>The Estate of the fifth, either not to be found
out, or hardly to be come at.</p>
            <p>And the experience of some <hi>Thousands of
years</hi> past, and the latter as well as the former
Ages, can and will bear witness, and record of
the usefulness and approbation of the Proces <hi>of

it would be hard that the Plaintiff should go

it would be good to put the Plaintiff in

that it should be so, and that it be put or form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>And the reason of that petition of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in Parliament to the King which intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
and procured that Act of Parliament,
(many Acts of Parliament and good Laws in
the former Ages being usher'd in, and obtained
by the Petitions of the Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to their King and Sovereign,) may in all
probability seem to be, for that they did not
think either the former Process of the Law by
Summons,<note place="margin">Bracton lib. 3. cap. 13.</note> Pone Distringas or Capias to be
severe or sufficiently coercive, or so powerful
to bring a Defendant to Justice, as the fear of
an Utlary, which in the Saxons times were so
Terrible as he that was outlawed was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
to be a <hi>Friendless</hi> or <hi>Lawless</hi> man
and was afterwards so formidable to those,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98392:38"/>
that by the contempt of the Laws incurred
in the forfeiture of their Liberties, Goods,
Chattels, Profits of their Lands, and Benifits
of the Laws, as it might well be believed
every man would be careful to avoid so great a
danger and trouble.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the eighteenth year of the
Reign of that King, being but seven years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the making of that Statute, it was deemed
to be for the good of the People to have it
declared by Act of Parliament in what cases
process of <hi>Exigend</hi> and Utlary should be, that
is to say, against such <hi>as received the Kings. Wool
or Mony, and detained it, such as transported Wool,
not Cocquetted or without Custom, against Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and Confederates of quarrels such as commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ryots and brought in false mony, if they could
not be found or brought in by Attachment or Distress,
and not against any other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by another Statute of the same year
<hi>no exigend was to be granted</hi> in trespass <hi>but where
it was for breach of the Peace,</hi> and at this day not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Statute of 25. <hi>E. 3. ca.</hi> 17.
no Writ of <hi>Capias</hi> can be made without a <hi>nihil

a more long, chargeable, and troublesome
delay, to get better issues to be returned,
may help to attest the more necessary, and
better use of the Proces of <hi>Capias</hi> and Arrest
and that Writs of Exigent and Outlawry,
will in the Cases aforesaid, <hi>propter inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem
necessitatem</hi> be everlastingly necessary;
especially when in the same Parliament of
25 <hi>E,</hi> 3. wherein Proces of Outlawry in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Debt were granted,<note place="margin">Rot. Parl. &amp; Petitions in Parl. 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3.</note> a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
was made, that the <hi>Steward</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal</hi>
of the Kings House, or their Deputies
did upon Actions attach, and distrain men by
ten Marks of their Goods one day, and by
as much the next day, to their utter ruine
and undoing.</p>
            <p>And the Goods and Chattels must be such
as the Sheriff can be confident, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
hath a property in, for otherwise he
will require Bonds, or Sureties of the Plaintif,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98392:53"/>
to be saved harmless; and where the Estate
doth lye only in Goods and Chattels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
an House, the Sheriff may in a Town or
City, where are many Inmates or Lodgers,
and three or four sometimes in an House to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
be not a little puzled, to know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whose Room he shall enter, or upon
whose property he seizeth, and his Serjeants
or Bailifs may be afraid to enter and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain,
for fear of Actions to be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them: And many of the Goods and
Chattels, may be such as the Law doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to be distrained; or if the Defendant hath
Lands &amp; a <hi>Distringas</hi> issueth out against him,
and hath no Stock or Cattle upon it, or
they shall be beforehand eloigned, or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
away (as it may often happen) there
will be little profit made of the Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Teste</hi> and return of the Writ, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if it come to be executed in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
season, or that much of it is in Lease:
And then he must do as well as he may to
get Tenants, whereby to raise the profits,
or let it lye for Crows and Trespassers to
raise it for him, for Tenants (such as wish
well to the Defendant, or are depending
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98392:54"/>
upon him, being not likely to be willing to
take or Rent it at all) will be hardly got;
and those that do malice or maligne him,
will (if they may not have it at cheap Rates)
be unwilling to adventure the hazard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of trespas, or other inconveniences
for a small term or time, which can be no
longer then until the Defendant shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
or make his peace with the Plaintif;
or if the Plaintif should himself take a Lease
of it, for such a short term from the King,
if he may not have it at a very easie rate, he
will be as little a gainer as the Defendant by
it, and as far from the recovery of his Debt,
as those that had lately Writs of <hi>Distringas,</hi>
against the Company of the <hi>Vintners</hi> or <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi>
in Actions of Debt for very great sums
of Money, whose Lands though it was well
known they had a great proportion of them,
belonging to their several Companies, were
so invisible as the Sheriffs or the Bailifs of the
County where they lay, could not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or would not tell where to find them.</p>
            <p>And if they did or could find any Lands,
would to avoid the trouble of an Actual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of the Writs of <hi>Distringas,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98392:54"/>
they were allowed no pondage Fees,
return small or petit Issues, and but such
as they could easily answer, take off, or
procure an Indempnity for, to save themselves
harmless.</p>
            <p>Or if a Tenant be himself in Debt, and be
distrained, and his Stock taken away, he is
sure enough to be undone, and his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
not a little prejudiced also by it, when
for want of Stock he cannot menage, or
hold his Farm any longer, which the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Westminster</hi> the 2. made in the <hi>13th.</hi>
Year of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the First,
did as well believe as foresee, when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
the taking in Execution the Cattle
and Utensils of Husbandry, now not at all
as to that particular obeyed or observed.</p>
            <p>And the Writs and Proces of <hi>Distringas</hi>
will be much more inconvenient, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to Trade and Trades-men, when
they become Creditors, or shall be made
Defendants, and be distrained by Proces of
<hi>Distringas</hi> for Debt, or in any other personal
Action, for then such a Defendant may sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
be ruined in his credit, &amp; not only him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
but ten or 20. of his Creditors suffer not
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98392:55"/>
a little by it: And it may be when all is
done, the Action may appear to be but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some malicious pretence, or upon Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
or Action of the Case battery or tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas,
where in no adjudication of the value
of the Action can be, had before a Trial
or Writ to enquire of dammages, and
one hundred Pounds worth of Goods may
be taken or spoiled, upon an Action of less
then so many Shillings, for the Sheriff to
have enough will not fail to seize more if
he can come at it, then the Demand of
the Writ or the Plaintifs suggestion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
unto, and the Defendants Estate
will thereby become ruined and racked, as
far as the greedy, unconscionable, or kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
pretences of a Plaintif (for all are not
likely to be conscionable or reasonable) shall
carry him unto, and after he shall be thus pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in pieces, or condemned and executed
before he be heard or come to his Trial, or
can well know what it is for, will be left
afterwards to make himself up as well
as he can (which to a Trades-man was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
easie) and seek his revenge or reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
by as many suits in Law or equity, as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98392:55"/>
himself, or his Friends, or necessities shall put
him upon.</p>
            <p>And when he hath appeared to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
after he hath been undone a great

easily restore, or so make himself up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
as to be in the same plight, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Credit which he was in before.</p>
            <p>And it is not also unusual to some Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
when they find themselves sinking, or
to be in any desperate condition, or likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of breaking, to endeavour more then
they should, to be most commonly before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
with their Creditors, make away their
Goods and Wares, lodge them in other
Mens hands, cover them under some secret,
and never to be discovered trusts, and putting
as much Money as they can into their Purses,
retire themselves into some Place <hi>incognito,</hi>
shut up their Shops, and leave little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
therein, and assoon as they can make
it their business to compound, and give their
Creditors for very great Sums of Money ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them, no better a satisfaction then three
or four Shillings in the Pound, and keep the
overplus for their labours; and a setting up
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98392:56"/>
again, which they could not so unawares or
advantageously, to their evil ends, have done
or contrived, if they had been arrested.</p>
            <p>All which or many more mischiefs, and
inconveniences happening to that kind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
Proces, may appear to be no over
nicely guessed or strained consequences, if
if shall be but considered what an abundance
of hideous, and remediles mischiefs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
would every day, and long ago
have happened to Shop-keepers, and Men of
Trade, and Credit in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and
the Suburbs thereof, if the Proces issuing out
of the Courts of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and <hi>Kings
Bench,</hi> and the Courts of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
against them had been not to Arrest
Defendants, but to distrain, and seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Goods and Wares, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of the Defendants Wares and Goods
may be so concealed, or disguised by Bills
of Sale, fraudulent deeds or contrivances,
(the Wares in a Trades-man Shop being
many times other Mens, who upon some
allowance of share, have employed or tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
them to Trade withal) as there would
be a necessity of Suites in <hi>Chancery,</hi> to discover
the right Owners.</p>

               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:98392:56"/>
Many or some of which inconveniences,
being before the making of that Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

            <p>ANd the difference betwixt the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
of Money upon Lands and real
Estate, and the procuring of it upon perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

be evidenced.</p>
            <p>When, security by Lands is now most
commonly by way of <hi>Leafe</hi> and <hi>Release,</hi> being
a dark way of assurance; and within the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of man, at first only purposely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrived
by Serjeant <hi>Francis Moore,</hi> at the
Request of the Lord <hi>Norris,</hi> to the end
that some of his Kindred or near Relations
should not take notice by any search of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Records, what conveyance or setle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he should make of his Estate; and by
the sad experience of sometimes double or
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98392:63"/>
treble Mort-gages, hath not appeared to
have been so safe as the former, which was
more publick and of Record.</p>
            <p>And when for a Security of two thousand
Pounds, the Borrower must upon strange
scrutinies, and almost a <hi>Spanish Inquisition</hi>
(the torture of the Body only excepted)
have his Estate, Evidences, and Credit put
upon the Rack, and be bound with an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of over-jealous, hard-hearted,
thorney Covenants, and unmerciful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soes,
and conditions too near of Kin to the
<hi>Scottish</hi> moveable Bonds, mort-gage Lands
worth four or five thousand Pounds or more,
give his answer upon Oath to a Bill in

that and the residue of his Lands and Estate,

year or two, for the repayment of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal

forfeiture, will, if he be a <hi>Nabal,</hi> more eagerly
then he needs or should, call for his Money;
upon a pretence of the Interest not being
duly paid (of which the back wardness and
delay of the Tenants may be many times the
only cause) or of his want of the principal
Money, which upon a due Examination
may appear to have more of a contrivance,
then truth in it; or if that will not trouble
or disturb the Debtor enough, will do all
that he can to affright him, to quit his right
in the Land, and permit him to have a
cheap bargain of it, by suggesting some flaw
and defect to be in the Title; and tells
him that otherwise he must call in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
for he dares not continue it any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
upon so weak an assurance: And if he
thus gets it at a lamentable cheap rate, can
notwithstanding assure himself he hath a
very good title, and such as needs no confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
but if that will not do his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and accomplish his griping design will
exhibit his Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> against him, to
enforce him to pay the Money, or loose his

Moneths, or some not very long prefixion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

Rates, and great disadvantages and loss to
a Stranger, or take what pittance or little
Sum of Money the Mortgagee will find a
conscience to give him, upon a Release of
his claim and interest in the Land, which is
twice and many times more worth then the
Money lent, upon some short prefixion or
time of Redemption allowed; And that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
him but som small parcel of relief,
and he being not also at that time able to
procure a Redemption, must lie down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

upon a short warning procure fourty or fifty
Pounds, upon his own Bond or Bill; and
a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> or some other trading
Town, can with a small Estate in Money
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98392:66"/>
and no Land, but a great care of his Credit
and performances, be trusted upon his Word,
Bond, Bill, or personal Security, with ten
or twenty times more then he is ever likely
to be worth.</p>
            <p>And it is very well known, that a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of <hi>London</hi> Merchants, Retaylers, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desmen,
and Artificers, in or about that vast
City, and the overgrown Suburbs thereof,
being in their number about <hi>six hundred
thousand</hi> Men, Women, Children, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
could not maintain or uphold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in their several orbs and stations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ovt
a trusting of their Customers; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
trusted themselves, or a confidence on
both sides in personal Securities, Bargains,
Contracts, and Promises; which is very often
done, and necessitated to be done without
Pawns or mortgage, security in the course
of Commerce and interchange of affairs
one with another, by all Merchants, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Retaylers, Farmers, Taylors, Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
Husband-men, and all sorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of People in the Kingdom, and other
Parts of the World; and even the landed
men and Free-holders, who are not the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:98392:67"/>
part of the Nation; and the Copy-holders,
when they do not deal for so great
Sums of money, as to surrender and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
their Copy-hold Estates, cannot in
the multitude, diversity, speed, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
of their almost daily and hourly
business one with another; and at Markets
and Faires, and elsewhere, avoid the taking
or giving of personal Securities or Contracts,
which cannot primarily affect those that have
Lands, or concern their real Estates, but are
to follow the Persons of those that are Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
for the performance thereof.</p>
            <p>So as it would be no Probleme, or <hi>Criple</hi>
assertion, to aver that the forbidding of
trust or giving dayes of payment, by
which the Citizens and Trades-men of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
do gain more then they should do
by enlarging their price, and <hi>Items</hi> to a very
great excess, and in some, as it may be
feared, to more then a double or larger In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and the taking of huge Sums of
money with <hi>Apprentices,</hi> now more then
formerly, become a part of their Trade;
and a publique Registring enjoyned of all
money and debts, which they do owe and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98392:67"/>
are engaged for, by Credit or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>Would quickly manifest how Trade
would be undone, if it were not for trust
upon personal securities, and performance,
and the benefit, and necessity of Writs of
Arrest, enforcing their Debtors to make
payment, or to be the more careful of it.</p>
            <p>And by so speedy a way of enforcing a
Defendant to appear to the Action, make
the Merchants and Trades-men so punctual
in their payments, whereby they do get
great Credit and Riches, and have given
a confidence to all Trade and Commerce,
which since the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
3. hath been hugely encreased, makes the
poor man, which hath no great Stock or
Estate, to be as good security for what
he undertakes, as those who have greater;
and gives us the reason, why those that do
lend Money unto Country Gentlemen, or
Men of great Estates do usually require a
Citizen, though he have but a very weak
and small Estate, and is more in danger of
breaking then the Gentleman, to be bound
with him, and do think their money not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98392:68"/>
to be very safely lent without such a secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
And that great City and <hi>Emporium,</hi>
which sitteth <hi>upon many waters,</hi> and <hi>stretcheth
out her lines to the utmost ends of the Earth,</hi>
would certainly languish and decay, if she
should be deterred, or bound up from
trusting, or being trusted; and there would
be none, or a very little Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
in the Nation, if it should not be
driven by personal securities, when our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
that do Trade into <hi>Persia,</hi> the <hi>East-Indies,
Turkie,</hi> the <hi>Levant,</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi>
with as much Money as Commodities, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
neither Pawns nor Lands to morgage,
do not seldom deal upon personal security;
Forreign Merchants being in that manner
contented, to do as they would have done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and do many times borrow money
in their own Countreys, to give day and time
of payment unto Merchants, and their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondents
in other Countries.</p>
            <p>And there would not be wanting, very
great and many mischiefs, inconveniences,
delayes, disturbances, and obstructions in the
universal Trade, and affaires of our Nation,
both at home and abroad, if that great and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98392:68"/>
daily manage of our Commerce at the
Royal Exchange of <hi>London,</hi> for vast sums of
Money or the value thereof, twice every
day, in every week, of every year, Sundays,
great Festivals, and publick and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
dayes of Fast, or Thanksgiving only
excepted, should by a jealousie and distrust,
in all Merchants and Men of Trade therein
every day concerned, and the Actions and
Estates of one another, forsake their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed,
and very laudable wayes of trust,

of their Bodies, subject to Arrests, compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

or Chapmen will, or can give day for his

his Customers have Goods sufficient to pay
for what they buy, or where to find them,
when the Wares that he sells may either be
used, or sold away again to another; or if
they could be met with again, will not be
of half the value they were sold for.</p>
            <p>No man without personal Security, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,

Merchants, because their Goods are either
at Sea, or in Forreign Countries, and sent

know how to get it again.</p>
            <p>Young Tradesmen, and Men of hope and

            <p>Many Lawyers and Ministers, who do

or single Men, all or the most part up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their backs; and the smaller sort of
Farmers and Country Cottagers, having
very little Goods or Houshold-stuff, may
bewail their want of Credit, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Security cannot help them; and
all the Trade and Commerce, good will
and charity of the Nation, that was wont
to flourish more by the Care and Credit,
and honesty of Men, then any certainty or
visibility of Estate, must, if necessities and
occasions cannot be supplied as they were

then the value of that which is bought or
borrowed, where ready money is wanting.</p>
            <p>And all Credit and Industry fall to the
ground, especially if it shall be considered
that not long before our late times of
Troubles and Confusion, the money of
some <hi>Dutch</hi> and Forreign Merchants lodged
here, being estimated to have been as
much as five Millions Sterling, have been
much of it by reason of our bringing down
of Interest to six per <hi>Cent,</hi> and other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances
called home; and that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
Current in the Kingdom, is by no very
random computation verily believed to be
scarce enough to pay the Interest of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
of what is owing by the People one
unto another; and if the course and way
of Credit should be now stopped, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out of his Chanel, we may not expect
to see any more happy effects of trusts and
Credit, as in this Age of ours we have
done in a rich Sir <hi>John Spencer,</hi> Sir <hi>William
Craven,</hi> Sir <hi>William Cockain,</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98392:72"/>
Bayning,</hi> who beginning their World with
no Original Riches, have gone out of it
with the comfort and honour, of laying the
foundations of several noble Families, and
every day in the hopes and flourishing of
many young Merchants, is ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the great benefits of trust and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and that, which not seldom happens,
by the only employ and advantage of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
mans money: And the sad <hi>&amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eluctabile
fatum</hi> dismal, and not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
disasters, which do fall upon those
whose former props of trust and Credit have
failed them, when their Friends stand afar
off, and look upon them as <hi>Lepers</hi> and
<hi>Persons infected,</hi> do by the ill government
of their tongues and censures, debar them
more then they should, of all the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of fortune, or means to a more
happy condition.</p>
            <p>It was Credit and the care of it, not
Lands or a visible Personal Estate, which
made our Prince of Merchants Sir <hi>Thomas
Gresham;</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
to be able to lame the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and
his <hi>Indies,</hi> in his design of subduing <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:98392:72"/>
by draining of his Banks beyond the Seas
with his personal security.</p>
            <p>It was personal Security, Credit, and the
care of not having any man come twice to
his house for money, which made Sir <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
Dawes,</hi> one of the Farmers of the
Customs, in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
<hi>Martyr,</hi> able to take of those who volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
offered it, one thousand Pounds at
a time upon his single Bond or Bill, which
to support he did alwayes (as he himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged)
keep five thousand Pounds at
a time in a Chest in his house at Interest, and
when he had paid out any considerable part
of it borrowed, and took in as much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish
it.</p>
            <p>It was an imaginary Credit, &amp; an heretofore
punctual performance of our late <hi>handy dandy</hi>
men the Bankers of <hi>London,</hi> paying one mans
money with anothers that decoyed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
almost all the money of <hi>England,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their running, ebbing, and flowing Cash,
upon their or their Servants single notes, for
some years &amp; under their only hands, for five
hundred or a thousand Pounds at a time, for
some years, after upon the Masters single
Bonds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:98392:73"/>
And it was Credit and personal Security,
not so much any real Estate in Lands or
Houses, that have made the Banks of <hi>Lyons</hi>
and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> so to flourish, in the midst of
Wars, and abundance of Taxes, and enabled
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> those mighty men of Trade
and money; whose Lands and Territories,
in all their Seven United Provinces, do in
quantity scarce equal our <hi>Yorkshire</hi> and <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnshire,</hi>
to ingross almost all the Trade
of the Heathen and Christian World, to
raise <hi>five Millions</hi> Sterling at home, upon
no more then as many Weeks short warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to manage at a vast expence, a
long and lasting War with the greatest Kings
and Princes of Christendom.</p>
            <p>It being certain that Securities, or Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for money or Credit, cannot in the
general be so safe possible, or ready at hand
to be had, as personal Security; which as

            <p>For a man may be known where to be
found, when his Money, Goods, or Estate
cannot, or what Estate he hath at home,
or abroad in his own or other mens hands
in trust for him, or otherwise: And the
Pawn or Pledge of the Body must needs be
the greatest tye upon a Debtor; for if a
Pedler travelling with a pack of Pedlery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Horse, hath his Horse distrained and
taken away, and he be put to carry his
pack upon his back, or if the Debt be so
much as to lay hold on both, that cannot
so disturb or trouble him, as an Arrest will
do of his Person: Or if a poor man shall
have his only Cow, and the Instruments and
tools of his daily labour taken from him,

that will not so much affright or beggar him,

            <p>But our Nation keeping it self constantly
to its own more gentle, and yet binding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
constant form of Bonds and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

some Centuries of years last past, hath with its

perswaded the People thereof justly to believe
that that kind of Proces hath produced such

only greatly encreased, encouraged, and
facilitated the Trade and reputation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

but it hath been its greatest prop, and
support in the for many years long and
bloody Wars, betwixt the two great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
when Estates in Land were little worth,
and where they were of any value, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed

and protected with secret and undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
uses, many of which were frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent,
and in the many other also tosses,
and troubles of our present and former
Ages, which may appear to be more then
a conjecture to any, who shall but consult
their own reason, and observations of the
difficulties and inconveniences which would
daily and hourly happen, in the borrowing,
procuring, or securing of money, if nothing
but Pawns or Pledges, at as hard a rate to
private Brokers many times as twenty per
Cent, or mortgages of Land would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for security for money, or moneys worth,
or the value of it, which in matters of Trade
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98392:76"/>
would so quickly turn all into Exchange
and Barter; as a Tradesman could not be
able to furnish, or stock himself, or his Shop,
without either ready money, which many
Tradesmen, and not one in every twenty,
are alwayes or often able to do, or disfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
or unstock themselves, and carry as much
out as they endeavour to take in; and how
quickly and easie, upon the stock of Credit,
Reputation, and Opinion, one or more hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pounds may be borrowed upon a Bond
with one or two Sureties? and how readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and without any more ado one or more
Counter-bonds of the Principal doth serve
to counter-secure them.</p>
            <p>And where Citizens do take Apprentices,
without whom they cannot manage their
Trade, and by taking too great, and in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages unheard of Sums of money, to teach
them their Mystery of gain, will find it to
be as inconvenient to themselves, in that
their new way of Prentice Trade, as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom
to the Parents of the Apprentices,
if they were to be satisfied with nothing
but a mortgage, by Security of Lands, or
Pawns, or Pledges to be given by them
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98392:76"/>
for their Childrens honesty, many times
dearly discharged, when as now their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Bonds or Covenants will suffise.</p>
            <p>And they ought not surely to be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
too Sanguine or over credulous, who
shall give entertainment to an opinion, that
if all the money which hath been borrowed
in the times of our <hi>English</hi> Troubles, lately
past or long ago, or in the now times of
our unparrelled pride, prodigality, and
luxury, had been to have been borrowed
only upon Mortgages, Pawns, and Gages,
the vitious and foolish part of the People of
this Kingdom, which are the far greater
number, would have long ago suffered their
follies, to have brought them into the sad
condition of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in the time of
the more thrifty and forecasting <hi>Joseph,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Genesis 47.</note>
when in a famine only of Bread, progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticated
to continue for seven years, they
were in the first year of it constrained, when
money failed them, to take bread in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for their <hi>Cattle, Horses, Asses, and
Flocks,</hi> and after their Bodies offered as
pledges upon the like occasion, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to give up their Lands for necessary
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98392:77"/>
(but no wanton) supplies.</p>
            <p>And although the first pawn or pledge,
that is mentioned in the Book of God, the
most Ancient and best of Records, to have
been given in the <hi>Fore-noon</hi> of the World,
was that of <hi>Judah</hi>'s Signet,<note place="margin">Genesis ca. 38.</note> Bracelets, and
Staff to his disguised Daughter <hi>Tamar,</hi> for a
security of what his Amours, and unlawful
Contract had promised; yet shortly after
his Brother <hi>Simeon</hi> became a personal secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to his Brother <hi>Joseph,</hi> for the bringing
unto him his youngest Brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
and was in the mean time <hi>bound and kept in
Prison;</hi> and <hi>Reuben</hi> upon his return to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jacob,</hi> to remove him from his unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
to send his beloved <hi>Benjamin</hi> into
<hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Genesis ca. 42.</note> offered his <hi>own two Sons in pledge,
that he would safely return him unto him again:</hi>
And when that could not prevail, <hi>Judah,</hi>
without being bound or kept in Prison the
while by his Father, became a Surety for
him as it were body for body, and <hi>that of
his own hand he should require him.</hi> And
the after Ages have found so great a benefit,
as well as a necessity of personal security, as
here in <hi>England</hi> long before the Statute of

            <p>And by our Laws agreeable in that and
many other particulars, not only to the
Civil and <hi>Caesarean</hi> Laws, but of the Law of
Nations the Plaintiffs, when by our Original
Writs, made out of the Chancery in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

And if the Law of Nature could have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us such a vast liberty, as some would

give us a power sufficient to restrain it, and

make that which at the first was <hi>merae vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis</hi>

a necessity, and out of any sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
freedom of our own wills or the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

            <p>Neither can any man by any rule of Law
charge our Laws with oppression, because
positive, or made in terror, or binding to
strict rules, to avoid arbitrarines or oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in the Judges, or rigour and severity
(as in some particular mans case, they may
happen to be by an abuse of them) but
the fault is rather to be laid at the doors of
those who do violate and break them.</p>
            <p>For an unlimited or absolute liberty, and
the <hi>liberty of the Subject</hi> are each unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

but do retrench, or take away some liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

might be inconvenient to the publick good:
For God the greatest and wisest of all Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative

they thought nothing could be added unto
it; saying they were of the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and <hi>under no Bondage,</hi> and are yet
above sixteen hundred years since bragging
of those their Laws.</p>

were by Law, if they were not able to pay

amongst the People, to set the men

<hi>Solon</hi> one of the wisest Legislators that
many Ages before or after had met withal, a
contemporary with <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> King of <hi>Juda</hi>
or living very near the time of his Reign,
though unwilling to meddle, or endeavour

covetousness of the one part of the People,
and the arrogancy of the other, was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
at the Request of the wisest
Men of the City content to intermeddle in

and was chosen Governour, to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former

by consent and agreement of

ask his Debtor any thing for the time past;
nor lend Money to Usury upon Covenants,
for the Body to begaged for it, and raised
the value of the Money and the Pound of
Silver, which was seventy-three Drachmes,
up to a hundred.</p>
            <p>Which offended the Rich, because they
were enforced to cancel their Bonds, and
the Poor because all Lands and Possessions
they gaped for, were not made common;
yet notwithstanding shortly after having
some tast of the benefits of his Ordinance,
they chose him General Reformer of the
Law, and of the whole State of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

whereupon he having made many good
Laws, but finding some to praise them,
oehers mislike them, and some coming
daily to him to expound his meaning<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and
considering therefore how it would get him
envy or ill will, either to refuse or yield
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98392:91"/>
unto it, resolved to get himself out of
the People, and to shun their groanings
and complaints, betook himself to be
a Master of a Ship, asking licence, to
retire himself for ten years beyond the
Seas.</p>
            <p>But in his absence a great Sedition ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<hi>Pisistratus</hi> a Tyrant was made choice
of by some of the People; and the City
notwithstanding they kept <hi>Solon</hi>'s Laws
and Ordinances, desiring a change, either
Parties hoping their conditions would mend
by it, and that every of them should be
better then their Adversaries. <hi>Solon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,
speaks unto every one of the Heads
of the Faction apart, and tryes if he could
reconcile them together; but though he
was much honoured and reverenced by the
People, seeing the Poor tumult, and the
Rich fled, for that <hi>Pisistratus</hi> coming into
the Market-place, and feigning himself to
be wounded by his Adversaries, for that
he stood with them about the Government
of the Common-wealth, had put the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into an uproar, and obtained a Guard
of fifty Halbardeers, and a Mace to be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98392:91"/>
carried before him, and aspired to be King,
went home to his House, took his Weapons
laid them before his Gate in the midst of
the Street; said, He had done all he could
possible, to defend the Laws and Liberties
of his Country; and from that time forward
betook himself unto his ease, and never
more after dealt in matters of State of the
Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Very long after that (there being it seems no

and that they which took Usury upon

promise, that no Creditor should take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their Goods, or Sell them, or Arrest
or take away their Children, as long as
they were in the Camp, they were listed
and pacified; but that War ended, and
another shortly after with as good succes,
they that were bound before, were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over to their Creditors for Debt, as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98392:93"/>
also others that were not bound or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
before.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the People seeing a Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
sued, and brought to the Bar, flock to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and make such a clamor as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
Sentence could not be heard, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
out the Creditors and misuse them, so
as the fear of the loss of liberty was transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Debtors to the Creditors, and
the People being discontented refuse again
to muster; whereupon the Consuls, by advice
of the Senat, seek to force them; but one
of them being summoned by the Consul to
appear, stood still and refused, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
sends to attach him, the People rescue
him; the Senators cry shame of the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and run down from their Seats to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the Serjeant: Yet for all this stir, saith
<hi>Livy</hi> the Prince of Historians, it was not
thought convenient to take away all keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Credit with the Creditors. But <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi>
being chosen Dictator, upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
much like that they had before, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
them to muster: Those Wars ended,
the Dictator moved the business again in the
Senat, concerning those that were bound in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98392:94"/>
Prison for Debt; but they refusing to order
any thing in it, gives up his Dictatorship,
and the People thinking he did it for their
sakes, follow him home with praises: The
Sedition increaseth again, and was laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side;
after that they mutiny again, and
withdraw out of the City into the mount
<hi>Aventine,</hi> and begin to fortifie; but upon
<hi>Menenius Agrippas</hi> Oration, and compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the mutiny of the several parts of
the Body against the Belly, they come to
an agreement, and amongst other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
it was granted, that they should create
two Tribuns of the People, to assist them
against the Consuls, and that their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
by an Oath to be taken amongst them,
should be sacred aud inviolable.</p>
            <p>About fifty years after, the Tribuns of the
People were at discord with the Consuls,
for that the Commons were not suffered to
make Laws, and though both sides agreed
it,<note place="margin">Livy lib<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 3. 109.</note> to be a matter most equal for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
that Laws should be made by the
Commons and Senators, yet they differed
about the legislative power: Whereupon
Embassadors were sent to <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Sparta</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:98392:94"/>
(when they had agreed of some Laws, but
could not accord who should be the Law-makers)

for the Common-wealth, and for them
and their Children, required to go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and read the Laws which were propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98392:96"/>
unto them, which they (meaning the

number were the three which had been sent
to <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> to learn their Laws)
had so far as Ten men with all their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

wits and heads of many men might see fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and better advise, they gave them
leave to consider and ponder every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and to reason together from point to
point, and deliver their opinions openly,
what was short, wanting, or superfluous in
every Article;<note place="margin">Sigonius &amp; A. Gellius Attic. noct.</note> and what Laws an universal
consent of the people should bring in, those
should be enacted and none other, that it
might appear they were not so much to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

be sufficiently corrected, as every one spake
to the Titles and Chapters thereof, in an

the very Well-spring and Fountain of all

            <p>But the next year after, the people find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Decem viri</hi> growing insolent, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine

tumult and protested against the

saying, They had created them Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
only for the publishing and enacting
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98392:97"/>
of certain Laws, but they had now no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in the City: And <hi>Appius</hi> one of the
Ten, having ingrossed into his hands the
power and disposing of his Partners, helps
on the Tumult by a business that happened,
upon his lusting after a young Maid, the
Daughter of L. <hi>Virginius,</hi> a Commander of
good note in the Army, and setting Mr.
<hi>Claudius</hi> to claim her as his Bond-woman,
who laying hands on her in the Market-place,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. 117.</note>
cited her to appear, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her to follow him, otherwise he would
force her; the People flock together, but
the Plaintiff tells them, they need not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themselves, for he proceeded according
to Law, and would do nothing by force,
cites her again to appear before <hi>Appius,</hi>
and the People perswade her to follow,
where the cause by reason of the expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of <hi>Icilius</hi> to whom she was betrothed,
not coming to hearing; that day she was
bailed and suffered to go under Sureties till
the next; but the second day, <hi>Appius</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hearing the Defendant or her Friends,
decreed that she should be a Bond-woman
to <hi>Claudius,</hi> who going to seise her finds the

People resisting him, <hi>Appius</hi> sends a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
to assist him, <hi>Virginius</hi> in a rage kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
his Daughter, that she might not come
into the Oppressors hands, and a great up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar
happening by the People, Kindred,
and Friends of the Maid, <hi>Appius</hi> cites <hi>Ici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
the Spouse of the Maid, as an Author
of the Tumult, and for his contumacy in
not coming, caused him to be attached and
carried to Prison; but <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>M. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratius,</hi>
two popular and powerful Senators,
thrusting back the Serjeant, said, If <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
had any thing to charge him with by
order of Law; they would Bail him; but
if he went about to offer violence he should
meet with his match: After that <hi>Appius</hi>
himself is arrested, who desiring to be bailed,
and not to be put in Prison or lye in Chains,
by all the Friends and pittyful speeches he
could make, could not obtain it; For that
he had, saith the Father of <hi>Virginia,</hi> so much
against all order of Law denyed the bailing
of her, who therefore commanded him to
be carried to Prison, as a person attaint
and convict: The Tribun of the Commons
set him a day to plead for himself and make
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98392:98"/>
his answer, but <hi>Appius</hi> before that day kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himself, his Goods were confiscated by
the Tribuns; the rest of the <hi>Decem viri</hi>
fled and were banished, and all their Goods
confiscated: And the Ten Tables having
two more added to them, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Tribuns, are set or hung up
openly to be seen, engraven in Brass.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> having long before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling

as is manifest by their manner of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Bail, before such time as <hi>Appius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
to take Bail, in the case of the Daugh-of
<hi>Virginius;</hi> which was <hi>ex veteri Jure,</hi> an

            <p>And this grand Commotion of the People
having nothing at all in it the while of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint

            <p>Threescore and five years after that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus

to deal in the Laws <hi>Agraria</hi> about the
Division of Lands, which had alwayes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
occasions of Seditions, began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle
between the Debtors and Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;<note place="margin">Livii lib. 6. 225.</note>
and to overthrow, saith <hi>Livy,</hi> all
keeping of Credit.</p>
            <p>And seeing a Centurion condemned in
an Action of Debt, and carrying to Prison
upon an Execution, with a rout and crew
of his Followers, rescues and takes him from
the Officers, and crying out that his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in saving the Capitol had been to little
purpose, if he could abide to see his Fellow-Souldier
carried away captive, did in sight
of the People pay down the Debt, set to
sale his own Land, and caused it to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
cried, that as long as he had one
foot of ground, or any thing else rest, he
would not see one of the People condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
&amp; upon Execution carried to Prison, and
stirred up such a Sedition in the City as the
People followed him as the protector of
their Liberties; whereupon the Dictator
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98392:99"/>
being sent for from the Army, assembled the
Senate, caused the <hi>Ivory</hi> Chair of State to
be set in the Common-Hall, and sent a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
for <hi>Manlius,</hi> who with a great reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
of his party presents himself before the
Tribunal; and tells the Dictator, that now
he saw he was created Dictator not against
the Common Enemies,<note place="margin">Livii lib. 6. 226, 227.</note> but himself and the
Commons of <hi>Rome,</hi> for he did see well
that he professed to maintain and bear out
the Usurers against the Commons: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
after many insolent speeches, the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator</hi>
commanded him to be carried away
to Prison; <hi>Manlius</hi> cryes out, <hi>O ye Gods
and Goddesses that inhabit the Capitol, suffer
ye thus your Knight and Defender to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used
by his Adversaries?</hi> But, saith <hi>Livy,</hi>
though every man that saw it was greatly
moved, the City as most patient of all
other Cities, to abide any just and lawful
Commandment of the Magistrat, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
her self, as neither the Tribuns of
the Commons, nor the Commons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
durst intermeddle in it, though many
of them did put themselves in mourning, let
their heads and beards grow in their grief
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98392:99"/>
and mourning for it, and with sad and heavy
chear kept commonly about the Goal-door;
but after a while threatned to break
the Prison, continued or rather increased
their Sedition,<note place="margin">Livii lib. 6. 228, &amp; 229.</note> and never left till the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
released him: Whereby the Mutiny
was never the more ended, but rather a
Captain given them to maintain it, the
People hope to be rid of Usury, <hi>Manlius</hi>
calls them home to his House, exhorts them
to maintain their Liberty, and to hinder
and cry down Dictatorship and Consulship,
and Proces and Course of Law for Actions
of Debt; the Senat and Tribuns in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
Authority,<note place="margin">Livii lib. 6. 230.</note> and the Tribuns of the
Commons also, seeing that in the loss of the
publick liberty their own power likewise
would come to an end, being much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at it, by advice of the Senat resolve to
Arrest him, and thereupon send and serve
Proces upon him, to answer at a day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;
which being come, he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
four hundred men, for whom he had
laid out Money <hi>gratis,</hi> saved their Goods
from Port-sale, and kept them from the
Bondage of their Creditors after they were
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98392:100"/>
condemned; reckoned and shewed openly
the Spoils of Enemies by him slain or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,
to the number of thirty, gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on him by Generals to the number
of forty, whereof there were two mural
Garlands for scaling of Walls, and 8 Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vick
Coronets, for saving the lives of Citizens
in danger, presented many in person whom
he had rescued out of the Enemies hands,
nominated <hi>Servilius,</hi> at that instant General
of the Hosse-men, stript his breast bare
shewed the scars received in the Wars,
looked towards the Capirol, and praid to
the Gods, to give the People the same mind
to help him as he had to help them; but
the People notwithstanding being called
out by the Tribuns, and drawn out by
Centuries or Wards, into a place where
they might not behold the Capitol, for
otherwise it was thought impossible for
them to get leave of their love and pity to
him to find the Indictment against him:
And the accusation prevailing more then
compassion, he was condemned for Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
holding Conventicles with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and his over much largess, to be
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98392:100"/>
thrown down the Rock <hi>Tarpeja,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Livii lib. 6. 231. &amp; Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch in vita Camilli.</note> where
himself had won so great glory by defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Capitol; his own Kindred ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
also a Decree, that none of that Race
should after bear the name of <hi>Marcus Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tribunes after that complain, that
the Senate sought to avoid the exhibiting
of publick Records and Books,<note place="margin">Livii lib. 6. 236.</note> which
gave testimony of the valuation of every
mans substance to the worth, because they
would not have the Sums of Debts to be
seen or shewn, which might shew that the
one part of the People were eaten up and
devoured by the other, and that if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
would call to remembrance their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
liberty, they would not suffer any
Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> to be awarded to Bondage
for Debt, nor any musters to be taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
a view were made, and just accompt had
of every mans Debts, that each man might
know what he had of other mens Goods,
what remanied of his own, whether his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
were left free, or at the mercy of his
Creditor to lye in cold Iron or baleful Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
on the other side the Censors alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98392:101"/>
that the Debtors cautelously would
not then keep their Credit and make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Which hire and salary or reward of
Sedition, saith <hi>Livy,</hi> shortly after stirred
up a mutiny, for that when many were
adjudged to be kept bound by their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the Tribunes would not suffer those
that were condemned to be led to Prison,
nor the younger sort of the Commons enter
their Names in the Muster-masters Book:
Howsoever the Wars coming on they leave
their mutinies; but after the Wars ended,
Tribunes Military with Consular Authority
were equally chosen, from out of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Commons; And the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
begins with Discords, Seditions, and
Broils (for no better were they then term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
concerning Debts, for the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
whereof, and to know to what
Sums they amounted, <hi>Sp. Servilius, Pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
and <hi>Q. Claelius Siculus</hi> were made <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,</hi>
but stopped by occasion of an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Volscians,</hi> notwithstanding the
fear and terror whereof; so little were the
Civil Discords appeased, as the Tribunes
of the Commons extended their power with
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98392:101"/>
more violence, to hinder the leavy of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
until they had indented and capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
with the Senate,<note place="margin">Livii lib. 6. 239, 240.</note> that so long as the
Wars lasted, no man should contribute or
be charged with any Impost, or be sued
in any Action of Debt, whereupon the
Commons are content to muster, two new
Legions were levied and enrolled, and to
War they go with the <hi>Volscians</hi> their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
but as soon as all was quiet from
Enemies abroad, they began a fresh to be
sued and troubled by their Creditors at
home, and having small hope to be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of their old Usury, fell into a new Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
by reason of a Contribution im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by the Censors for making of a Well,
which they had set out to be made of
square Ashler stone; but being forced to
yield thereunto, and to go to War against
the <hi>Volscians</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> after several Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
obtained, and the Armies returned
to <hi>Rome,</hi> the calamities of the Commons
grew every day more and more, for they
wanted means and were not able to pay for
the Interest, that needs must be paid; and
when nothing was to be had to make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98392:102"/>
out of their Goods were adjudged
and awarded to satisfie their Creditors in
their Bodies. Which gave occasion to <hi>M.
Fabius Ambustus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Livii lib. 6. 241.</note> a man of much repute
with the Commons, upon the proud dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
of a younger Daughter, not being
married so well as her elder Sister, whose
Husband was a Tribune Military, plots
with his unpreferred Son in Law and <hi>L.
Sextius,</hi> who hoping to compass some alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the State, by reason of the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Debts that men were grown into, got
themselves made Tribunes of the Commons;
upon which advantage <hi>C. Licinius,</hi> the Son
in Law of <hi>M. Fabius Ambustus,</hi> and <hi>L. Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
propose Laws touching Debts, that
when so much was defalked and deducted
out of the Principal, as had been paid for
the use and Interest, the residue should be
paid by even portions in three years; that
no man should hold in possession above five
hundred Acers of Land, and that there
should be no election of Tribunes Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
but of Consular; with which the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
being much troubled, could find no
other remedy but the negative voice of some
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98392:102"/>
of the Tribuns to step between, and had
wrought some of their own Brotherhood
to do it, who as soon as they saw the Wards
or Tribes, called forth by <hi>Licinius</hi> and
<hi>Sextius</hi> to give their Suffrages, would not
suffer those Bills to be read or pass by the
Commons; whereupon when the Nobles
began to choose the Tribuns Military, <hi>L.
Licinius</hi> and <hi>Sextius</hi> crossed them, so as
there was no election at all, but of <hi>Aediles</hi>
and <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the Commons,<note place="margin">Lib. 6. 242.</note> for <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
and <hi>Sextius</hi> being chosen Tribunes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
suffered no Magistrates of the Chair,
or of State to be created; After that other
Wars ensue, and with much ado an Army
is levied, <hi>Sextius</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> the publishers
of those Laws were the eighth time made
Tribunes of the Commons, and <hi>Fabius</hi>
also a Tribune Military, five in eight of
the Tribunes of the Commons ernestly,
and like men bestraught of their wits, urge
for to have those Laws enacted; <hi>Sextius</hi>
and <hi>Licinius</hi> with part of their Tribune
Brethren, and <hi>M. Fabius</hi> the Military Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune
being, saith <hi>Livy,</hi> their Craftes Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and knowing well enough by so
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98392:103"/>
many years experience, how to manage the
minds of the Commons, demand of them
how every one of the Senate, and other
Rich men, could in equity hold the Land
well near of three hundred Citizens, and
a Commoner have hardly ground enough
to build him a House upon, and to serve
for a place to bury his Dead, whether
the Commoners oppressed with Usury
should yield their Bodies to bear Irons and
suffer Torments, unless they pay the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
before the principal? and that daily
they should in whole Companies be had
away from the bar, and condemned to
thraldom, and alledge that the Commons
could never be relieved, until they make
one out of their body a Consul, who
might be equal in the Soveraign command
and power of the Sword, and maintain
and protect their liberty. The next year
the Legions being returned home, the same
Tribunes of the Commons are chosen, and
the same Laws again proposed; the Senate
when they saw the Tribes called, and none
of the Tribunes step forth to stop their
proceedings,<note place="margin">Lib. 6. 243.</note> began to be exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98392:103"/>
and choose a Dictator; the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
of the Commons call a Common
Hall, &amp; summon out the Wards to give their
voices; whereupon after the Laws were
propounded, and some of the Tribunes
denyed them <hi>Camillus</hi> the Dictator, their
good old successful General, formerly the
Saviour of their Common-wealth against
the <hi>Gaules,</hi> a man of undoubted honour
and integrity, and the Darling of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
sided with the gain-saying Tribuns,
and stickling to maintain their intercession
and gain-saying authority, sent his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
and Serjeants to command the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to depart, threatning withal that if
they proceeded thus like Conquerors to
give Laws, he would take a Military Oath
of all the younger sort, and presently lead
an Army forth of the City, which put them
and their Captains and Ringleaders in
so great a heat of contention, as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator
terrified with some unlucky signs of
the Birds, gave up his office; mean while
in an Assembly of the Commons summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Tribunes, the Laws were passed
concerning Lands and Usury; howbeit
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98392:104"/>
shortly after it was found that <hi>Licinius</hi> had
a great many more number of Acres of
Land than his own Laws permitted. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this another Dictator was chosen, who
nominated <hi>Licinius</hi> General of the Horse-men,<note place="margin">Livii lib. 6. 245.</note>
who with <hi>Sextius</hi> at the next Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
day for the Tribunes of the Commons
so demeaned themselves, as seeming to be
weary of the place, they were the more
eagerly desired by the Commons, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
thereupon, that the Commons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were they that hindred their own
good, who might presently, if they would,
have their City, their Common-Hall, and
places of Assemblies freed from those Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
and their Lands recovered again
from the unjust Landlords; that it stood
not with the modesty of the People of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to require to be eased themselves of
Usury, &amp; set in possession again of the Lands
with-held from them, and to leave those
old Tribunes, by whose means they had
gained those commodities to shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
without honour or hopes thereof;
and that if the Commons should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to speak affirmatively to those Laws,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98392:104"/>
it would be to no purpose to choose any
Tribunes, neither would they accept of the
Tribuneship, neither should the Commons
have those Laws ratified, which were already
granted:<note place="margin">Livii lib. 6. 247.</note> But upon an Oration or Speech
of <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> a Senator, setting forth
the inconveniences of what was propounded,
and that by what had been already wrested
by the Tribunes, <hi>All Credit in borrowing and
lending, and taking and putting forth of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
would be abolished, to the destruction of
all humane Society, Commerce and enter-course
whatsoever.</hi> The matter was adjourned,
and the publication of those Acts cut off
and deferred; but the same Tribunes <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
and <hi>Licinius</hi> being chosen again the
Tenth time, got a Law enacted, that of the
<hi>Decem viri</hi> for Church &amp; Ecclesiastical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
some should be elected of the Commons,
with which they were so well content, as they
laid aside the business of Tribunes Consular,<note place="margin">Livii lib. 6. 248.</note>
and gave way for the creating of Tribunes
Military; and the Venerable <hi>Camillus</hi> being
almost fourscore years old, is the fifth time
chosen Dictator, but after the Wars ended
with the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who had invaded them,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98392:105"/>
is welcomed home with a hotter Sedition
in the City; where after many sharp bicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
and contentions, the Senate and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator
were forced to accept of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
Laws, and <hi>Sextius</hi> was created Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
out of the Commoners; but by reason
that the Nobles refused to give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
that <hi>Camillus</hi> should leave his place
of Dictator, the Tribunes of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
as <hi>Camillus</hi> was set in his Chair in the
Town-hall hearing of causes, sent a Serjeant
to him, who commanded him to follow
him, and laid violent hands upon him, to
carry him away by force; Which made an
uproar, saith <hi>Livy,</hi> was never before seen
in the Common-hall or Town-house, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus</hi>
Friends driving the Serjeant behind
the Chair; and the People crying out from
beneath to the Serjeant, to pull him out:
Notwithstanding all which he would not
resign up his Office, but taking with him
those Senators which were about him, went
towards the place where the Senate was
wont to be kept, but before he could go in,
he returned back again to the Capitol, and
made his prayer to the Gods, that it would
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98392:105"/>
please them to bring his Troubles again to
a quiet, and made a solemn vow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
if those Troubles might be pacified,<note place="margin">Plutarch. in vita Camilli.</note>
to build a Temple to <hi>Concord.</hi> And the
matter coming after to be debated before the
Senate, there hapned such an hot contention
and diversity of opinions, as the easier way
carried it, which was to grant the Common
Peoples desire, that a Commoner should be
chosen Consul with a Noble Man, and it
was agreed, that the Common People should
be content that the Nobles might out of
the <hi>Patricii</hi> create a <hi>Praetor,</hi> or Lord Chief
Justice for <hi>Oyer and Terminer</hi> in causes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the City, which being by the <hi>Dictator</hi>
published to the People, they were so joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as they brought <hi>Camillus</hi> home to his
house, with great shouts of joy and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of hands; and being the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
assembled in the Town-house or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place,
decreed, that the Temple of
<hi>Concord</hi> should be built at the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth's
charge, that some Festival dayes
should be solemnized, and Sacrifices made
unto the Gods in every Temple of the City,
to give them thanks, and that the People
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98392:106"/>
should in token of joy wear Garlands upon
their heads for this reconciliation.</p>
            <p>About nine years after upon a new Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of choosing of Magistrates, and for want
of them an <hi>Interregnum</hi> happening, the
Commons lost their Consulship again, and
two of the <hi>Patricii</hi> began to govern, who
thinking to continue it as formerly in the
Nobility, had the trouble of another Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein the People after many stirs
and meetings not prevailing, two other
Confuls of the Nobility were elected. And
though the Usury or rate of Interest was
much abated, yet the poorer sort of the
People being over-charged with the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the principal, became bound and
thrall to their Creditors, in so much as the
Commons, in regard of their private streights
which they were driven unto, never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
their heads at all any more with the
making of Consuls.<note place="margin">Livii lib. 7. 262.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the end of the next year after,<note place="margin">Ibid. 263:</note> the
contention betwixt the Senate and the
Common People brake forth, concerning
the Election of the Consuls; whereupon
the Tribunes of the People stifly denyed to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98392:106"/>
suffer any Assembly to be holden, unless
they might have one of the Consuls to be
chosen out of the Commons, according to
the Law <hi>Licinian:</hi> And the Dictator as
stoutly bent to denye it, the Election was
adjourned, and the Dictator leaving his
Office, the matter grew again to an <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum,</hi>
and the Interregents finding the
Commons to be alwayes maliciously set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Senators, succeeded one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
until the Eleventh <hi>Interregnum,</hi> when
the discord and variance still continuing,
the Tribunes called on hard for the Law
<hi>Licinia;</hi> the Commons had an inward grief
that struck nearer to them, upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Usury that still increased, and each
mans private care and grievance brake out
in their publick contentions and debates;
the Senate thereupon weary of such Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
commanded <hi>L. Scipio</hi> the Interregent
for the time, being for concord and unity
sake, to observe the Law <hi>Licinia,</hi> in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Confuls, so as <hi>P. Valerius Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi>
had joyned with him in fellowship of
Government, <hi>Cajus Martius Rutilius</hi> one
of the Commons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:98392:107"/>
Who labouring to ease the matter of
Usury, being that which hindred the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
agreement, set a course to do it, so
as the long or old debts, which were more
intangled rather in regard of the Debtors
<hi>slackness</hi> and <hi>negligence</hi> then <hi>want of ability,</hi>
the City out of the common Stock crossed
them out of the Book, by setting up cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Counters or Tables, with ready coin
in the publick Hall, provided that good
Security were given to the City, by Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
put in beforehand, or else the Goods
of Men valued at indifferent and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
prices were to discharge the Debts, so
as a great number of Debts, without the
complaint of either Party, was satisfied and
paid.</p>
            <p>Two years after the Ancient possession,<note place="margin">Livii lib. 7.] 267.</note>
saith <hi>Livy,</hi> of the Consulship was restored
to the Senators; and about two years after
that, the Usury coming but to half so much
as it was formerly, the payment of Debts
were dispenced, and ordered to be paid in
three years by even portions, so as a fourth
part were paid beforehand, some of the
Commons being for all that pinched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98392:107"/>
for that the Senate had more care to
see Credit kept with the Chamber of the
City, then of the difficulties of private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which was the better born in regard
of the forbearance to muster Souldiers, and
call for Tribute.</p>
            <p>About seven years after that, upon a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
of the Souldiers, in the Camp a Law
was published by a Tribune of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that Usury should be made altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unlawful; and after many nnreasonable
demands, saith <hi>Livy,</hi> the insurrection of
the Souldiers, who compelled their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
to march against the City, was
upon a Capitulation made as once before
(saith that learned Historian) the Commons,<note place="margin">Livy lib. 7. 279.</note>
and a second time the Army had done with
the Senate, that their mutiny and insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
should not be made use of to their
danger or dishonour, it was appeased.</p>
            <p>About sixteen years after, being three
hundred and thirteen years before the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
or coming of <hi>Christ, Papirius Publius</hi>
being bound for his Fathers Debt,<note place="margin">Lib. 8. 301.</note> &amp; having
consigned himself a Prisoner to the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
who supposing that he might abuse
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98392:108"/>
the young mans Body for Interest of his
Money, began to tempt him with fair words
and promises, afterwards to threaten him,
and when that would not serve, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to be stript naked and whipt;
whereupon the young man all wounded and
torn ran forth into the Street, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
to all he met, of the filthy lust and
cruelty of the Creditor; and thereupon a
great company of People moved with the
injury of the Usurer, and pity of the young
Man, as also in regard of their own case
and their Children, gathered themselves
into the Market-place or Town-hall, and
from thence towards the Senate-house; and
the Consuls being upon this suddain uproar
<hi>Coacti,</hi> saith <hi>Livy,</hi> compelled, to assemble the
Senate; the People as the Senators entred
in the Senate-house lay prostrate at their
feet, as they passed by shewed the young
mans back and sides; whereupon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
were commanded to propose to the
People, that from hence forward no person
whatsoever, unless guilty of matters Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

People did approve were but Annual, if
by rogation or asking the People's consent,
being called together by their Wards, it
obtained the force of a Law, and without
a rogation or demanding the Suffrage of

so as a Law,<note place="margin">Bodin de Repub;</note> it was not because all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

            <p>But whatsoever it was, it extended not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98392:110"/>
nor was so much as intended to take away
that necessary power of the <hi>Praetor</hi> or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat,
of coercing or compelling men to
appear before them in Judgment, but was
abrogated or continued but for that time
or a little after, or not put in execution,
a fate which many other enforced Acts or
Orders of that Common-wealth came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
as that of the Law <hi>Licinia,</hi> or choosing
of one of the Consuls out of the Commons;
that of lessening of Usury at one time, or
taking it quite away at another, which had
their intermissions; the latter of which was
so impossible to be kept, as by custom and
mens necessities it came to be to no purpose,
which the many Seditions of the People,
which happened afterwards concerning U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,
and the more ease then abatement
of it, may be enough to perswade us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
For besides what may be observed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the enforcing of that Law, and the
course taken to pacifie the People, the
meaning of <hi>Bona Debitoris pecuniae oreditae
non Corpus obnoxium esset,</hi> That the Goods
of the Debtor not his Body should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxidus
or liable to the Debts, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98392:110"/>
be understood to be, that the Goods
of the Debtor should be sold or taken in
Execution, for the satisfaction of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,
as far as they would go, and that
his Body howsoever should not be bound or
lye in chains for it, and that those that
were bound in Fetters or Chains were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased
from that kind of imprisonment, as
may appear by the Body of that Law, or
the perclose and conclusion of it; which
only saith <hi>Ita nexi soluti,</hi> so those that were
bound in Fetters or Chains were released,
which must be understood to be by the
Sale of their Goods; And for the time to
come, singly relating to the matter of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in Chains or Fetters, not as to the
Sale or taking of Goods hath only these
words, <hi>Cantumque in posterum ne necteren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi>

if extended to the People, in their affaires

the Statute of 37 <hi>E. 3. ca.</hi> 18. expoundeth
it by <hi>due Proces of Law;</hi> and what that kind
of Process was, hath been already deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
and proved, to be as well by Writs

Pone and Distress,</hi> though the latter, as
the condition and course of the affairs of

and usual, and it appeareth by that
part of <hi>Magna Carta</hi> ca. 29. and the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therein, that there was a Process or
proceeding in Law, besides the <hi>Legale Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium,</hi>
or Trial by Peers or Jury; and the
Process where Defendants were not willing
to come to Judgement, and have their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
determined (which but in very
seldom Cases never was or is likely to be
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98392:122"/>
otherwise, there was and will ever be a
necessity of compelling them by Proces to
appear in Judgment, when they delayed or
refused it: For as the great and learned
<hi>Grotius</hi> hath said upon another occasion,<note place="margin">Posthuma Grotii in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistola qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</note>
The Liberties claimed from a Prince, ought

accord with his Superiority and their duty
of Subjects; for our so eager clamours of
Liberty, cannot certainly be so nayled to
any of their extravagant opinions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
as to induce them to think it either to be
lawful, rational or consistent with the Great
Charter, to deny the King or his subordinate
Courts of Justice, a power to Imprison any
that shall be guilty of Contempt, against
His Person or Authority, and to constrain
them to appear in Judgment.</p>
            <p>For the way which the Judges and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
of our Laws have hitherto used, in the
Construction and understanding of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(nothing appearing to the contrary)
hath been an Inquiry into the occasion and
purport of them, commonly expressed in
the preambles and reason thereof, and into
the sense as well as the words of them, for
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98392:123"/>
the preamble of an Act of Parliament, saith
<hi>Dyer,</hi> sometimes Lord Chief Justice of the
Court of Common Pleas, is the Key to <hi>open

               <note place="margin">Plowdens Comment. 363, 369, <hi>&amp;</hi> 469.</note>
and a Man ought not to dwell upon the

on his part,</hi> that <hi>he hath the Law on his part,</hi>
say the Judges in the Resolution of the Case
between <hi>Easton</hi> and <hi>Studde,</hi> in regard that the
rule in the expounding of Statutes, is to <hi>search

to be collected out of the words thereof,
according to the true intention and meaning of

to hunt our Laws, like the <hi>Ermyns</hi> for the

<hi>There are now ten thousand Men in Prison for

adventures to say, that <hi>a noble Man, by being
outlawed, is made incapable to sit in the house

no such matters; and a Noble man
and Peer of Parliament cannot in any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
action, or ordinary Trespas by our
Laws be outlawed; and although some
other Persons may by abuse or error happen
to be outlawed, when they should not be
outlawed, and by some evil accident ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be able to find the Plaintiff or his Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
whereby to recover his damages, yet
it is so seldom as it is very rare; and our Laws
as they did never undertake to prophesie, or
to have a prescience or certain knowledge
of things to come, so they never provided
against <hi>raro contingentia,</hi> things seldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening,
or of little consequence, neither
can our or any other Laws be able at all
times, to prevent all the tricks and evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which the deceitfulness of mens
hearts do too often put in practise. And
that nameless Author may, upon his better
acquaintance with our Laws, inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and those for whom he so much busieth
himself, that if an Outlawry should, as he
surmiseth, be indirectly gained, the Court
out of which it proceedeth do, when dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
never fail severely to punish such an
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98392:132"/>
Offender, and give what remedies they can
unto those that do suffer by it; and that
there is a Statute, which was made in the
Tenth year of the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Sixth,<note place="margin">10. &amp; 18. H. 6. ca. 9.</note> and renewed in the <hi>18th.</hi> year of the
said Kings Reign, yet unrepealed to prevent
and remedy it.</p>
            <p>And is as much out of the way when he
saith, That Tenures in Villenage were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
by Act of Parliament,<note place="margin">Rot. Parl. 5 <hi>R.</hi> 2.</note> when in the
Parliament of the fifth year of the Reign of

of Villaines, which had been extorted from
that Kingby <hi>Wat Tiler</hi> and his rout of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
were declared to be void, and the
wearing out of that Tenure, in the many
Intestine Wars and Troubles of the Nation,
and the favour and indulgence of our later
Kings and Princes, and the Nobility and
Gentry of this Kingdom, is to be ascribed
more thereunto, and a desuetude &amp; length of
time, then unto any thing else, which hath
so washed many a jolly Gentleman that
would be, and Men of great Estates, whose
Extractions and Originals (were at the first
lodged in those Tenures) in the Waters of

               <hi>Lethe</hi> and Oblivion, as there are now very
few or none to be found of them.</p>
            <p>And is as little to be excused when he
saith, That the Mortmaines of Abbies were
taken away by Acts of Parliament, unless
that he means by the total dissolution of
them, which hapned long after those Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,
and is as wide from the mark, in
his impertinent Accompt of the Money
or profits of the Bishops Courts, as he is
of any proof or certainty, that they are a
burden, and can hardly instance any one
Attorney (but certainly not many) that
hath in one Writ of Priviledge, named or
sued one hundred Defendants, and held
them to special Bail, whereas such a vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would have been remedied by an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
unto any Judge of the Court, out of
which such Writ issued, who had by the
Law a power in his discretion, to order
whether any special Bail should be given, as
the case required.</p>

he could have received any recompence for

with the Laws and Government of <hi>France</hi>
and other Nations, hath in his learned
Book! Written on that Subject, proved
and demonstrated that our Laws of <hi>England,
Do deserve the Preheminence over all other
Laws, and do more secure the People in their
Estates, Liberties, and Properties</hi> then those
of <hi>France,</hi> or any other Nation.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who made it her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and usual Charge to her Judges, to
do Justice, and not to disturbe or delay it.
Governed her people by her Laws, in
Plenty, Peace, and Prosperity, to the
Worlds admiration, Terror of her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and the Comfort and Support of her
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98392:135"/>
Friends and Allies; did so after her
death Reign and live in her peoples hearts,
as they in or about <hi>London</hi> have to this
time, from the Coronation or beginning
of her happy Reign, now above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and sixteen years ago, in a grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of it, never omitted to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
that day, with the Ringing of Bells,
some legacies having been given in some
places also,<note place="margin">Cokes 2. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat.</note> for the perpetuating thereof;
King <hi>James</hi> had a great care of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and execution of the Laws, in whose
peaceable and plentiful Reign, ten years
have passed without any Tax or Assessment
of the people: And King <hi>Charles</hi> his Son,
made a great part of his Coyn to wear
the Inscription, that he fought against a
Rebellious part of his Subjects, to
maintain the Laws, priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and liberties of the people, and
dyed a Martyr, because he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray,
or deliver them up to a Lawless, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited,
and ever to be dreaded Arbitrary
power.</p>
            <p>So as that seducing Author, might have
found a better imployment, then to throw
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98392:136"/>
dirt at our Laws before he understands
them, and might have been able to have
given a better accompt of his time, if he
had followed the advice of Sir <hi>Edward Coke;</hi>
Who was so much a welwiller to the Proces
of Arrest and Utlary, as whilst he was Chief
Justice of the Court of Comon Pleas, he
did never dislike or refuse the putting his
name and Teste to such kind of Writs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Kings Seal entrusted to his custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and being afterwards made Lord
Chief Justice of the Court of Kings Bench,
had so good an opinion of the Process of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and the necessity and usefulness thereof,
as that to maintain and support the Writs of
<hi>Latitat</hi> and Bills of <hi>Midlesex</hi> in Actions of
Debt, and other personal Actions then too
often made by that Court, which had no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
or Conusans thereof; but in Case
of a Defendants present imprisonment, or of
priviledge of some of their Members to hold
Pleas in such kind of actions, he feigned a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
to be made and used in the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
thereupon, that the Defendant was
in <hi>Custodia Marr' Marescalli Curiae</hi> and actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Prisoner, when he neither was so at the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98392:136"/>
time of the making of the said Writs, or the
time of the Defendants giving Bond for his
appearance to the Sheriff, or at the time of
the Plaintiffs declaring against him, as he
did publiquely declare in Print, That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man ought, <hi>next to his duty to God and
his King, to yield a due reverence and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Common Laws of</hi> England, <hi>for
that of all Laws humane they were most equal,
most certain, of great antiquity, least delay,
most beneficial, and easie to be observed;</hi> And
<hi>That he could defend them against any Man,
that is not malicious without understanding,
and make it manifest to any Man of judgment
and indifferency, by proofs pregnant and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
and by Records and testimonies lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent
and irrefragable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which just and due value and estimation
of our Laws may well be credited, when if a
Jury of the Subjects of our Neighbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Kings and Princes, or of the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique
of <hi>Holland,</hi> that <hi>Corporation of Kings,</hi>
were impannelled and fitted with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and understanding of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of them, they could not either as to the
imposing or payment of Taxes, or to any
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:98392:137"/>
other particulars, refuse to give a Verdict
upon Oath, that our Laws and Customes
do in their perfection, and right reason ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
far excel those by which they are
governed, aud that the Subjects of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Wales</hi> are by the happiness of a well
tempered Monarchy, and our Laws as secure
from any danger of arbitrary power as any
people under Heaven.</p>
            <p>And he would find it to be a difficulty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable
to ptocure our Merchants of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or any of those who do undertake to
insure the hazardous adventures of those that
do go or send to Sea, and see the wonders
of the deep and adventure their personal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
upon the cholerick waves thereof, not
seldom accompanied with humerous and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
winds, to give him an assurance and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
that the people shall not be ruined
by that his goodly indigested project, which
in its folly and inconveniencies, as to
the credit, reputation and Justice of the
Nation, exceeds that of <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> that great
Master of Ignorance, who had perswaded
his Rable-rout to believe, that it would be
an excellent piece of Reformation, and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98392:137"/>
much for the good of the people, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
all learning and dispatch all business
and affaires by the help only of the <hi>Score</hi>
and the <hi>Tally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And will howsoever be as incertain of the
success, which none but mad Men, and such
as the <hi>Turks</hi> and Men of <hi>Mecha</hi> do usually
adore, can believe to be answerable to
the end of publick good; as he may soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
adventure to make an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> if
any credit could be given unto it, of the
possession infallible of the imaginary <hi>Elixir</hi>
or <hi>Philosophers Stone,</hi> the only Essay of the
gaining whereof, hath undone and emptied
the Purses and Estates of many more learned
then ever he will be, then that the People of
<hi>England</hi> have either lived in Slavery since the
making of that Statute of 25. <hi>E. 3. ca.</hi> 17.
or that there will such an happiness and
mercy arrive or redound, as he pretends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, by the abolishing of the Process of
Arrest and Outlawry, when seven parts of
eight, the whole to be divided into no more,
shall be ruined in their present Estate, and
future hopes of a better for want of credit
and trust: And all the <hi>Men of Money</hi> lent out
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98392:138"/>
and trusted, which are the smaller number,
shall be in danger enough of loosing it; And
the Free-holders of Lands, which compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
are far the smaller part of the Nation,
shall be only the Men, and perhaps not half,
or a quarter of them, that may be trusted or
compelled to appear to any Actions of Debt,
or for Money which shall be commenced or
brought against them; And the Trade of
the Nation which is now not so much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
as it either should or ought to be, shall
be very little stocked, or driven with ready
Money for want of trust, or such a Process
as may with any certainty, or expedition com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the performance of it.</p>
            <p>Or that His late or now Majesty, when
our Kings and Princes were wont in many of
their Writs and Rescripts, to acknowledge
that they were <hi>Debitores Justitiae,</hi> Debtors to
their people in matters of Justice, <hi>&amp; Astricti,</hi>
bound and obliged unto it by their Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Oaths, could ever think it to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their interests, or correspondent to
their Oaths, and other obligations to God
and Man, to throw the Justice of the Land,
with which they have been by God intrusted,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98392:138"/>
into a <hi>Chaos</hi> and confusion, to gratifie the
humors of a smali or inconsiderable number
of his Subjects, the <hi>quondam Rebells,</hi> and
most factious and ignorant part of them, and
ruine the multitude, who are as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

when they seek to please a few, they do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
and abandon those who are much the

            <p>Howsoever let Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> say and
write all that he can, in the never to be
denyed just praises and commendations of
our Laws, those that without any cause
or knowledge do too much maligne and

hath not at all inveighed against the Process
of Arrest and Outlawry in Actions of Debt,

made any mention, that they were either il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal

say, that it was not before that time, upon
Contempts of Courts of Justice, or the

Liberties of the People were by a wicked
Rebellion, under a pretence of Reformation
of Religion for some years before endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,

be translated out of an old <hi>French</hi> Copy, which

he must be acknowledged to have been a

There shall not be such gentle Process or
Proceedings, by way of Attachment as is
usual in other Cases, but such Malefactors
are presently to be arrested, and the Goal
or Prison is to be their Sureties, until they
defend or clear themselves; yet<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> those kind
of necessary proceedings can have no other
original or ground to support or warrant
them, but what proceeds from the before
recited grounds or causes, or some of them;
because until the Fact be tryed, it is but an

it was done by him that is accused, and
there will be alwayes a <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus,</hi>

not to be done in other Cases, having the like
ground of reason and justice, attended with
the same circumstances; neither can <hi>atrocitas

be any <hi>atrocitas</hi> or hainousness in them,
or where it is done involuntarily; as in
Cases of Trespass, or damage done by a mans
Cattle, for Trespass may be greater or lesser;
and if every Trespass could be understood
to be of the greater size or magnitnde, and
so horrid and enormous; yet there can be
no reason to make the Caption or Arrest to
be in part of Corporal punishment, before
the Judge or Magistrate be ascertained of the
guilt of the Party, or instructed how to keep
the order which the Laws of God, Nature
and Nations, and our <hi>Magna Carta</hi> have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned;
that is to say, to punish only <hi>secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum

            <p>And that supposed ground or reason gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

body to imprisonment until it hath made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement

a Tryal had by Jury, whether he be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

in Debt can be dreamed or fancied to
be, and a <hi>Capias pro fine,</hi> after a Tryal and
finding guilty, will either shew that it was
not the arresting of the body in Trespass,
which was intended or inflicted for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
but the <hi>Capias pro fine;</hi> and if
both, the <hi>Capias</hi> in Trespass before Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the <hi>Capias pro fine</hi> after Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
should be inflicted for one and the

            <p>They would not be <hi>secundum modum sive

            <p>Nor will that other cause or ground given
by him in the Report of the said Sir <hi>William

which he was sworn to protect, and give
him licence to break Laws, who is not in

in our Laws as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> is, and
with as much reverence as is or can be due to
so great a lover of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and
the veneration which he justly merits: I must
of necessity, by what appears in the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
and Treasury of time and Antiquity,
and what is clearly to be perceived in those
pure streams, which the Fountains of Justice
and right reason have imparted unto Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
assert what I have done, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that he was a man, and hath as the best
Authors may in their Books sometimes do,
which are not Scripture and Canonical, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in averring that there was no Process of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:98392:143"/>
arresting the body of a Debtor, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or after judgment, until the Statute of
25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. which gave Process of Outlawry in
Actions of Debt.</p>
            <p>When in allowing Process of Arrest in debt
in the Kings Case, as he doth in Actions of
Trespass, he must acknowledge the same
reason and necessity, (which is a just and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
coertion to appear before the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
of Justice, and of caution to be given
to abide their judgments, to be in Actions
of Debt, and other personal Actions.</p>
            <p>And he himself in many of his Books and
Writings hath as well as the Civil Law, and
our Common Law, and the Law of Nations
affirmed, that the same Reason may claim
the like Law; For the reason that <hi>Joseph</hi>
would have imprisoned his Brethren, upon
a suspition that they were come to espie the
Land,<note place="margin">Genesis 42. v. 16, &amp; 36.</note> and kept <hi>Simeon</hi> a Prisoner until their
words (and denials) were proved, gives us
the reason, necessity, and justice of arresting
in personal Actions and Debt, as well as
Trespass, until cause or caution be given of
appearing in Courts of Justice, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the judgments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:98392:143"/>
And that learned Judge could, if he were
now living, very well remember, that he
hath often said as well as found, that many of
our Acts of Parliament are but declaratory
of the Common Law, and that which was
long before used, and understood to be as
it was reasonable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the matter or thing excepted in an
Act of Parliament, is not included in any
purvieu or provision of it, but is out of the
reach and gun-shot thereof; and that when
in the Statute of</hi> Magna Carta <hi>made in</hi> 9 H.
3. ca. 29. <hi>it is said, That</hi> no Freeman shall
be taken and imprisoned, or be disseised of his
Freehold or Liberties, or free Customes, or be
outlawed or exiled, or otherwise destroyed, but
by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law
of the Land. <hi>And by</hi> 25 Ed. 3. ca. 4. That

               <note place="margin">Sir Edward Coke in Mag. Chart. 50, 51, 53.</note>

the Registring of any such Severeties, as on
the contrary he doth make mention of the
extraordinary clemency and lenity of that
Virtuous Prince, who although he was
a most diligent inquisitor of any male ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Justice by his Judges; yet

those Judges did confess that they had so
Judged, or done because they knew no

Whereupon they <hi>viz.</hi> His Earles and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate

wholly addict themselves to the study of the
Laws, so as to a wonder the Earles and
Judges aforesaid; many of whom from
their youth were ignorant and illiterate, did
by study endeavour to make themselves more
able, choosing rather the hardship thereof
then to be put out of their places.</p>
            <p>And the names of those Judges, which were
said to have been hanged, do if there were

the cry of Oppression and Invasion of their

and may therefore require some search to
be made for the fountain and rise of that
popular Frenzy and distemper, and that so
much mistaken late outcry against the

when the arguments which are
framed and brought by that vulgar and

declare that they have not much troubled

that by overturning the long approved

built, they might open a passage to let in
that gain and <hi>Anarchy</hi> which they aimed at,
which being once made known to their

reading the wrong way, he was willing to
invite his Readers to believe that the</hi> Court
of Parliament had a lawful power to question
the Kings Patents, Charters, Commissions,
Proclamations, Grants, Warrants, Writts,
and Commandments, whether they be legal, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:98392:152"/>
to Cancell and repeale them that be illegal
or mischievous and onerous to the subject, not
only without but against his consent. It is
lawful for the people submitting themselves
to prescribe the King and his successors, what
Laws they please; the Sheriffs of every
County were antiently elected by the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
and had power to raise the Militia,
that the Navy, Ammunition, Armes, and
Revenue of the King, though they be in his
possession, are the Kingdoms; That Kings
and their great Officers, Counsellors, and

by the people, that the King hath an absolute

right and Justice for the publique good,
that the Parliaments present necessary defensive
war is just and lawfull, both in point of Law,
Divinity and Conscience, and no Treason or
Rebellion: the Parliament hath a right and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
to impose Taxes and Contributions
upon the subjects, for defence of the King
in case of the King his wilfull absence, or

               <hi>by</hi> John Field, <hi>and published in the

wherein he falsly endeavoured to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
against all the grounds and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of Law and Religion:</hi> That
Kings and their Families have no calling to
the Crown; but only by the people, Royalty
is not transmitted from Father to Son,<note place="margin">Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords Lex Rex.</note> if
the people may limit the King, they give him
the power, who is the servant of the people,
both objectively and subjectively, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
unto them; who cannot make away
their power, but do retain the fountain power
of making a King, that to swear non self pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
and to swear self Murther, is all
one: The King is a Fiduciary Life-Renter,
not a Lord or Heritor, the conscience of the
people is immediately subordinate to God, not
to the King mediatly or immediately, the
Judges are the immediate Vicars of God, not of
the King; The Parliament hath more power
then the King, The Crown is the Patrimony
of the Kingdom, not of him who is King or
of his Father: The Parliament are not Judges
by derivation from the King: Who cannot
make or unmake Judges Inferior Judges, are
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:98392:153"/>
more necessary than a King: Parliaments may
conveen and Judge without a King: Are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Judges with him, not advisers only.
Subordination of the King to the Parliament,
and Co-ordination are both consistent: The
King transgressing in a hainous manner, is
under the coaction of Law: Defensive Wars
are lawful: And there may be a distinction
betwixt the Kings person and his Royal power.
The Physical act of taking away the life of
offending persons, when commanded by the
Law of self-defence is no Murther. Wars rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Subjects and Estates for their own
just defence, against the Kings bloody Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are lawfull: Parliament power, is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
power above the King: Who is but a
noble Vassal of the Kingdom: Is not head

convene without the King: Subsidies are the
Kingdoms due rather then the Kings.</p>
            <p>And thus provided, and the scaling lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
made ready to storm the Laws, which
were the Forts and Bulwarks of the King and
Government, and heretofore made it their
business to give help or shelter to the King, the
<hi>Deformers</hi> rather then <hi>Reformers,</hi> do hasten
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:98392:154"/>
one another to be up and doing. And
therefore in a Pamphlet entituled <hi>Liberty
vindicated against Slavery.</hi> Printed in the
year 1645. the Author declared that <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
for Debts, is against the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws of</hi> England. Propositions were
shortly after made unto that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Monarchy underminers,</hi> called the
Parliament for the laying aside the <hi>six Clarks
in Chancery, and the imploying their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Clarks at Cheaper Rates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1646. Mr. <hi>John Cooke</hi> of
<hi>Grayes Inne,</hi> who sufficiently deserved to
be hanged, drawn, and quartered, as he
was afterwards as a Traytor, in a Book
dedicated to the most high and most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Court of Parliament, the supreme
as he calls it Judicatory of the Kingdom,
saith that the <hi>alteration of fundamental Laws,</hi>
as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> saith, <hi>produces many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies,
as in that statute of imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mens bodies for Debt.</hi> And there must
needs be good work in that their sport of
pulling down and setting up, when it
hath been as truly said as verified, that the
Kings Parliament began in 1640. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98392:154"/>
with some freedom of Votes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<hi>December</hi> 1641. From thence it was
governed by the City of <hi>London</hi> and their
Tumults, Propositions, and Petitions, unto
<hi>December</hi> 1643. And from thence by the
<hi>Scots</hi> and their rebellious <hi>League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
unto the Month of <hi>June</hi> 1647.
When the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had the ascendant
and predominancy, and that was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
called the <hi>Apprentises Parliament;</hi>
And after that Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
which was governed by his Army,
and their Addresses, Declarations, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals,
wherein the Independant party were
Superior, and ought to be called the <hi>Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King in the mean time, in his great
desire of peace with those whose wicked
designes never intended it, not making
that right use which he otherwise might
have done, of the successes which God had
given him in the just defence of himself and
his Loyal Subjects, and the Laws, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and Religion of his People, tired
with the treachery of those that too often
betrayed, and sold his just advantages, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:98392:155"/>
overpowered with an Army of Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Scots,</hi> who came to assist their brother
Rebells of <hi>England,</hi> and believing himself
to be somthing safe in their Oaths and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and flying to them for Succour,
was by a party of them contrary to the
Laws of God and Nations, sold to the
<hi>English</hi> Rebells, for <hi>two hundred thousand
Pounds</hi> Sterling, Too great a summe of
Money to be restored again, as <hi>Judas</hi> did
the thirty pence, the wages of his sin for
the betraying of our Lord and Saviour,
and by tricks and devices carried Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
from place to place, untill he was
barbarously Murthered. And the Heire
and Royal Issue driven out of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
and then every Mechanick head
was set on worke to frame a new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in which there were as many diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of opinions, as there were Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
and Sinister ends, to advance their
particular ambitions or advantages, and a
mart being kept of <hi>Whimsies,</hi> some being
much in love with the Balletting box used
at <hi>Venice,</hi> others with the <hi>Rota</hi> and Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringtons
Oceana,</hi> and all or too many thus
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:98392:155"/>
busied, Sedition and Ignorance sat in their
Triumphal Chariots with the Laws<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Religion of the Nation like so many
Captive Kings in Chains attending, all
which did not fully correspond with the
Votes and expectation of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>
when as <hi>Cromwell</hi> the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>at Encourager of
the Independents or Fanatick party, then
the more numerous, feeling his own strength
and having a prospect of a better design of
establishing himself, did so delay and trifle
with the Parliament his Masters in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of disbanding the Armies, as the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>
Souldiers in the mean time selling
their <hi>Debenturs,</hi> the wages of their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
and wickedness, at 16 <hi>d.</hi> or 18 <hi>d.</hi> a
pound, with a long Interest, to the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
who were thereby easily enabled to
buy King, Queen and Princes, the Bishops,
and Dean and Chapters, Nobility and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
Lands, as they mis-called them;
and that party being so well gratified, were
not afterwards unwilling to Lacquey after
his hypocrisie, and permit him to frame and
make his own Instrument and method of a
more arbitrary Government then our Laws
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:98392:156"/>
permitted, or any of our Kings or Princes
exercised, and to be as a single person <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector</hi>
of all the <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Fools</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> withall their
fancied and supposed Liberties, which as
they used them were but to hunt and chase
all that were loyal and honest, and thought
they might do any thing to the <hi>Amorites,
Moab</hi> and <hi>Amalek,</hi> and that all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was contained in Gain, being [as they
supposed] Sanctified into a pretence and
outward semblance of Godliness.</p>
            <p>In the later end of the year 1648. some
thousands of Well-affected, as their Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
perswaded them, inhabiting the Cities of
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> Borough of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi>
and Hamlets, supposing the Time to
smile upon their purposes, did Petition that
which when the King was murthered was no
Parliament, that they would consider the
many thousands that were ruined by perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
imprisonment for Debt, and provide for
their enlargement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the year 1649. one</hi> Thomas Faldoe <hi>of</hi>
Grays-Inne <hi>
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> was so loth to have his
Conceipts and Opinions lag behind, as in a
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:98392:156"/>
Pamphlet entituled,</hi> Reformation of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
at Law, <hi>published on the behalf of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and the Commonwealth of</hi> England, <hi>he
complained, That</hi> the Law of Property was
depressed and useless, by the colour of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Imprisonment, and sacrificed to all the
Birds of prey, even to Covetousness the mother
of Cruelty, in the several Offices and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Justice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the same year came out a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of divers as they called themselves
Well-affected persons in or about the City
of</hi> London, <hi>petitioning the Parliament, That</hi>
all tenures in Capite, and all inferiour Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
being great grievances and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
might be taken away, the Laws translated
into English, the Six Clarks, Head Registers,
Masters of Chancery, and the Petty-bag, Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit
Office, Prothonotaries, and all other grand
Monopolies and Patentees, might be abolished,
no mans life taken away for Felony, unless ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Murther; that the eldest Sons
in every Family might have a double Portion
in the Fathers Estate, and the rest be divided
amongst the younger Children; that no Fines be
paid to any Cursitor, or upon any Original Writ,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:98392:157"/>
but may be quite abolished; that no mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
might be imprisoned for Debt, but his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
made liable to satisfie the same: it being
more suitable to the Turkish or Heathenish pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
then to Christian English Professors of
the Gospel, to rack and grind the bodies of men
in prison.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At the heels whereof was brought to that</hi>
Assembly at Westminster, <hi>(who named them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a</hi> Parliament, <hi>and to cherish such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
seldom failed by their Speaker to give
thanks in the name of the House to all Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the Well-affected in the County of</hi> Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<hi>said to be a Representation of the

That they had waited eight years in the

with which God had invested them and the
whole Nation, kept from them by Arbitrary

interessed parties, and desire that all

the late King, whose first predecessor was that
Outlandish Bastard <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi>
from whence proceeded the original of all their
slavery both in Tenures, Laws, Terms, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in an Outlandish tongue, the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
being the chief Instruments of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
might be abolished; and protesting against
all arbitrary Laws, Terms, Lawyers, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators,
Lords of Manors, Priviledges, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
Tolls, Tithes, going to the Terms at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> payment of Heriots, Quit-Rents,
Head-Silver, Lawyers Fees, and the whole
<hi>Norman</hi> power, being a burden too intollerable
to bear; did invite all men to enter upon
Commons, and cut and fell the Wood growing
thereon, and desired <hi>(which they would not
be willing to do if they had been Lords of
Manors, and other the parties struck at)</hi>
to go by the golden rule of Equity, <hi>viz.</hi> to do as
they would be done by, not to tyrannize over
any, or to be tyrannized over.</p>
            <p>Another Pamphleteer feared he should
be taken to be ill affected to the babe of
Sedition, if he also should not be doing
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:98392:158"/>
somewhat, in a <hi>Modest Plea</hi> as he terms it,
dedicated to the High Court of Parliament,
which he would have to be the Supreme
Authority of the Nations, prayed, <hi>that
there might be an equal Commonwealth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

            <p>In the same year, the Lord General

the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> Colonel

the honour, freedom, and other unquestionable

               <hi>In the same year, the Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in the Regiments of Colonel</hi> Scroope,

of the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which
never imposeth any Fines but against offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
<hi>and the like</hi> against Vtlaries, <hi>which
were</hi> unnecessary, <hi>and</hi> did tend only to Charges

            <p>Isaac Pennington <hi>the younger, the Son of

and derivatively in the Parliament
their Substitutes and Representatives, and
that the people ought well to look to their

that in every City, Corporation and Division

               <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> a Prompter at a Play-house
long before he was a my mick Preacher and
the abuse of the Pulpit, having made many
a Renegado Voyage from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
thence to <hi>New-England,</hi> and from

Government by succession from Father to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:98392:161"/>

            <p>
               <hi>And in</hi> June 1651. <hi>in his Book entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>

that in every County every Hundred
do choose three men to be Peace-makers for a

without Appeal; Wills and Testaments to be
acknowledged before two next Justices, and
entred in the Parochial Registries; five or
seven in every Town or Hundred to be yearly
chosen to determine all Debts or Strifes,
whereof three to give sentence without Appeal;
that Summons instead of Arrests may be left
at mens houses, none to distrain for Taxes or
Debts, but the Debtors outward doors to be
taken away and carried to the Town-house,
and as many other new doors as shall be set in
the place; every man plead his own cause,
and if he think himself too weak, let him

have liberty to take a Friend or Neighbour to
plead for him, but no Advocates or Seriveners
to plead for any man; if any Lawyers be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
let them be allowed and paid by the
State; all Suits in <hi>London</hi> and great Cities
to be determined in a week. Which being
done, it was very advisable to burn all the old
Records, even those in the <hi>Tower,</hi> the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Tyranny.</p>
            <p>And had so in a short time after haled
on his design of destroying all the Records
and memorials of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> to
make way for his new contrivances, as a

Parliament, or one of their <hi>Mock-Majesty
Mace-bearers,</hi> had an express order
(happily diverted by some other affair
when it was ready to be put in execution)
to throw all the Records remaining in the

            </p>
            <p>And the Law that it might the better be

that</hi> Tolls in the Market are a burden,
that the Gentry do oppress the Common people,
live idly upon their labours, and carry away
all the comfort and livelihood of the Earth;
that the powers of Lords of Manors do remain
still over their Brethren, requiring Fines and
Heriots, beating them off the free use of their
Commons; the Commoners have cast out the
King, therefore they are in equity free from the
slavery of that Lordly power, and that it will
blast the power of the Parliament and Army to
see the Government of the Commonwealth to be
built upon the Kingly Laws and Principles; and
that all slaveries and oppressions which have
been brought upon mankind, have been by
Kings, Lords of Manors, Lawyers, Landlords
&amp; Divines, who ought to be cast out; and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that there may be a Judge in every Shire,
Peace-makers in every Town, Overseers and a

such a number to be proved, there are
greater numbers of Carpenters and Smiths,

necessary labours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In a Declaration and Proclamation of
the Army (as they called themselves) of
God, published in the same year, they did
declare and resolve,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Declaration of the Army in <hi>Anno</hi> 1659.</note> by the help of God that
there should be liberty of Conscience, but not of
Sin; Godly Laws to be enthroned, but not the
Jews; Judges to be in every City, but not
imposed; Prison doors should be set open, to
let out Debtors to labour towards the payment
of their Debts; and look'd upon it as the voice
of God calling upon them, and giving them
an opportunity; <hi>and therefore desiring</hi> assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in so great an enterprize, by as many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of note and ability as God hath made
willing and able, together with themselves, to
put in sufficient security for the performance
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:98392:171"/>
thereof, did intreat them to send in their names
to Mr. <hi>Livewell Chapman,</hi> Book-seller in
<hi>Popes-head-alley</hi> by the <hi>Exchange,</hi> who hath
promised to keep them secret untill by sober
and frequent meetings the matters may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
fit to be presented to the Parliament
and chief Officers of the Army.</p>
            <p>Where if the Propositions do prove accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
there will be a sum of 500000 <hi>l.</hi> ready
towards performance of the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the Plea called the Armies Plea it
is alledged, that</hi> the peoples safety is the chief
Soveraignty of all Laws, Statutes, Acts and
Ordinances, Covenants, Engagements, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
Subscriptions, Vows, Oaths, and all
manner of obligations and expressions thereof,
and are only binding to the Publique safety,
and not to the persons of the Governours or
forms of Government, but with reference
thereunto, and as principles of truth and
right reason brought to light by the late
Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And one being willing to come on as fast
as he could, and keep company with those
goodly assertions, saith, that</hi> it is not lopping
the branches, or cutting off the Top branch of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:98392:172"/>
Monarchy, that will deliver a Nation from
bondage, unless the Axe be laid to the root
thereof, to the evil root of bitterness whence
springs all our misery, to the root of every
usurping and domineering Interest, whether in
things Civil or Divine.</p>
            <p>The number of Freeholders being much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
hath had a natural and strong ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
towards a Commonwealth; no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can be fix'd in this Nation, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Ballance of Land; that Prince that
is not able neither by his own or the publique
Revenue, in some measure to counterpoise, if
not over-ballance the greater part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
must necessarily be Tenant at will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another in his Arguments and fancied
Reasons against the office and title of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
published in the year aforesaid, saith,
that</hi> the Office of a King makes way for an
Act of resumption, and the unsetling of mens
Estates; that the abolishing of Episcopacy and
Peerage, and the establishing of Liberty for
Tender consciences, were not the ground of the
Wars, for nothing appeared at the first but
the Militia, the Negative voice, and the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Evil Counsel, the other things were
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:98392:172"/>
brought into the quarrel in the progress of the
contest, by an higher hand of providence then
mans purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One of the same company and School of
contrivances desired publickly, that</hi> no man
should be imprisoned for Debt, except such as
are doubted to be running away, and then not
above three days, and to be maintained by the
Plaintiff at 3 <hi>s.</hi> a day in the mean time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In a Book stiled the</hi> Good Old Cause
dressed in its Primitive lustre, <hi>said to have
been written by</hi> R. Fitz-Brian, <hi>it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated,
that</hi> the distempers of the Nation
being so great, as they could not admit of a
redress and conserve still their old frame
things must unavoidably wheel about and fix
themselves upon another Basis; Providence
united the honest party of the victorious Army,
so as it was resolved that the poor who had
nothing to pay their Debts, should be freed
from the bondage of a perpetual Confinement;
the corruption of the Laws were become at
once both the shame and impoverishment of
the Nation, and some Expedient was to be
had for the freeing of it from so horrid
a Cheat; Divine providence did by degrees
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:98392:173"/>
point out a necessity of the change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Kingship being laid aside as unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
chargable and dangerous, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
into a Commonwealth: It being a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
rule, that corrupt and degenerate States
cannot be perfectly healed and regulated, but
by stepping into those forms which are the
farthest distant from that wherein they were
corrupted.</p>

large and ample Estates to themselves, <hi>and
therefore</hi> straightly charged the said Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners

Commission which was intended for the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
relief of poor, miserable, and distressed
Prisoners, certain refractory and obstinate
Debtors which rather wanted will then
meanes to satisfie their just Debes, took occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to molest and trouble their Creditors, did to
prevent all occasions of Inconveniencies to his
loving Subjects, especially such as tended to
the breach of his Laws, forbear for many

Evasions to avoid the payment of their just

Debts, so also that for want of that, or some

was expected, renewed the said Commission,
and thereby prescribed and directed such a

the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> and
the places near adjoyning to the same, whose

he could not do it by the one way and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
for our Laws and Courts of Justice
would never allow a Plaintiff to have two
Actions or Remedies for one and the same

to hinder it, as they suffered discontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Process and Pleas in Abatements
where one Action was brought depending
another for the same matter:<note place="margin">Bracton lib. 5. c. 17.</note> And <hi>Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

depending at the Common Law, and
seeks relief in Chancery upon the same
Account, he is put to make his Election in
which Court he will proceed.</p>
            <p>And therefore if such an Arbitrary Act
of Parliament should be made to give the
Plaintiffs their Election to proceed by the
way of the new contrived way of peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Summons, the former wayes of <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Pone,</hi> and <hi>Distrainings,</hi> or <hi>Capias</hi>
not being prohibited, the proceeding by
process of peremptory Summons ought to
be entred in a Court of Record, and entred
may be more prejudicial to the Plaintiffs
then they expected, for if they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
or return again to the former better
wayes of proceedings, they may find cause
enough to repent of their being so fond of
a new way, when the old will appear to
have been much better, which to reverse
or discontinue cannot be, for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the King or his people, when it shall
