         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

all three the enſignes or peculiar inſtruments of a
KING: by the firſt, He <hi>Reignes,</hi> by the ſecond He
makes <hi>Lawes,</hi> by the third He maintaines them: and
the two firſt are but bables without the laſt.</p>
            <p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Touching the <hi>Crowne</hi> or royall Diadem of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
there is none, whether <hi>Presbyterian, Independent,
Proteſtant,</hi> or others now in action, but confeſſe that it
deſcends by a right hereditary Line, (though through
divers Races, and ſome of them Conquerours) upon
the Head of CHARLES <hi>the firſt</hi> now Regnant: 'tis
His owne by inherent birthright and nature, by Gods
law, and the Law of the Land, and theſe Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
at their firſt ſitting did agnize ſubjection unto Him
accordingly, and recognize Him for their Soveraigne
liege Lord: Nay, the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> denies not this,
for though there were <hi>Bulls</hi> ſent to diſpenſe with the
Engliſh Subjects for their allegiance to Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
yet the Pope did this againſt Her as he took Her
for a <hi>Heretique,</hi> not an <hi>Uſurpreſſe,</hi> though he knew well
enough that She had been declared Illegitimate by the
Act of an Engliſh Parliament.</p>
            <p>This Imperiall Crowne of <hi>England</hi> is adorned and
deck'd with many faire Flowers, which are called, <hi>royall
Prerogatives;</hi> and they are of ſuch a tranſcendent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that they are unforfeitable, individuall, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>transferable
to any other: The KING can only ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and diſſolve Parliaments: The KING can onely
Pardon (for when He is Crowned, He is ſworn to rule
in <hi>mercy</hi> as well as in <hi>juſtice:</hi>) The KING can onely
Coyn Money, and enhance or decry the value of it: The
power of electing Officers of State, of Juſtices of Peace,
and Aſſiſe is in the KING; He can only grant ſoveraign
Commiſſions: The KING can only wage War, and
make Out-landiſh Leagues: The KING may make
all the Courts of juſtice ambulatory with His Perſon,
as they were uſed of old; 'tis true, the Court of <hi>Common
Pleas</hi> muſt be ſedentary in ſome certain place for ſuch a
time; but that expired, 'tis removeable at His pleaſure:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:162233:4"/>
The KING can only employ Ambaſſadours and Treat
with forain States, &amp;c. Theſe, with other royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
which I ſhall touch hereafter, are thoſe rare and
wholſome flowers wherewith the Crowne of <hi>England</hi>
is embelliſhed, nor can they ſtick any where elſe but in
the Crowne, and all confeſſe the Crowne is as much the
KING's, as any private man's Cap is his own.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond regall Inſtrument is the <hi>Scepter,</hi> which
may be called <hi>an inſeparable companion,</hi> or <hi>a neceſſary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix
to the Crowne;</hi> this inveſts the KING with the
ſole Authority of making Lawes, for before His confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
all reſults and determinations of Parliament are
but Bills or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they are but abortive things,
and meer Embryos; nay, they have no life at all in them
till the KING puts breath and vigour into them: and
the antient cuſtome was for the KING to touch them
with His <hi>Scepter,</hi> then they are Lawes, and have a virtue
in them to impoſe an obligation of univerſall obedience
upon all ſorts of people, It being an undeniable maxime,
That <hi>nothing can be generally binding without the King's
royall aſſent,</hi> nor doth the Law of <hi>England</hi> take notice of
any thing without it: This being done, they are ever
after ſtil'd <hi>the King's Lawes,</hi> and the Judges are ſaid to
deliver the King's judgments, which agrees with the
holy Text, <hi>The King by judgment ſhall ſtabliſh the Land:</hi>
nay, the Law preſumes the <hi>King</hi> to be alwaies the ſole
Judge Paramount, and Lord chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi>
for he whom He pleaſeth to depute for His chiefeſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
is but ſtil'd <hi>Lord chief Juſtice of the King's Bench,</hi>
not Lord chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> which title is peculiar
to the KING Himſelf, and obſervable it is, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
He grants Commiſſions and Parents to the Lord
Chancellour (who is no other then <hi>Keeper of His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:162233:5"/>
and to all other Judges, He names the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of His own Bench by a ſhort Writ only containing
two or three lines: Now, though the <hi>King</hi> be liable to
the Law, and is contented to be within their verge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are chiefly His owne productions, yet He is
ſtill their Protector, Moderator, and Soveraigne, which
attributes are incommunicable to any other conjunctly
or ſeparately.</p>
            <p>Thus the KING with His <hi>Scepter,</hi> and by the mature
advice of His two Houſes of Parl. which are His higheſt
Councel &amp; Court, hath the ſole power of making Laws;
other Courts of judicature doe but expound them and
diſtribute them by His appointment, they have but <hi>Juris
dati dictionem</hi> or <hi>declarationem,</hi> and herein, I meane for
the Expoſition of the Lawes <hi>the twelve Judges</hi> are to be
<hi>believed before the whole Kingdom beſides.</hi> They are as the
Areopagites in <hi>Athens,</hi> the chief Preſidents in <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Spaine</hi> in an extraordinary <hi>Junta,</hi> as the <hi>Cape-Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diques</hi>
in the <hi>Rota's</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Republique of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
whoſe judgments in point of interpreting Lawes are
incontroulable, and preferred before the opinion of the
whole Senate whence they received their being; and
who hath ſtill power to repeal them, though not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
them. In <hi>France</hi> they have a Law-maxime,
<hi>Arreſt donné en Robbe rouge eſt irrevocable,</hi> which is, <hi>a
Scarlet Sentence is irrevocable,</hi> meaning when all the
Judges are met in their Robes, and the Client againſt
whom the Cauſe goes, may chafe and chomp upon the
bit, and ſay what he will for the ſpace of 24 howers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Judges, but if ever after he traduces them, he
is puniſhable: It is no otherwiſe here where every igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
peeviſh Client, every puny Bariſter, ſpecially if he
become a Member of the Houſe will be ready to arraign
and vie knowledge with all the reverend Judges in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:162233:5"/>
Land, whoſe judgement in points of Law ſhold be only
tripodicall and ſterling: ſo that he may be truly call'd
a juſt King, and to rule according to Law, who rules ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the opinion of his Judges; therfore, under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
I do not ſee how his Majeſtie for his part could be
call'd injuſt when he leavied the Ship-money, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had the judges for it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I now take the <hi>Sword</hi> in hand, which is the third Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a King, (and which this ſhort diſcours chiefly
<hi>points</hi> at) it is aſwell as the two firſt, incommunicable
and inalienable from his Perſon; nothing concernes his
honor more both at home and abroad; the <hi>Crown</hi> and
the Scepter are but unweildy and impotent naked indefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
things without it. There's none ſo ſimple as to think
there's meant hereby an ordinary ſingle ſword, ſuch
as ev'ry one carrieth by his ſide, or ſom imaginary thing
or chymera of a ſword; No, 'tis the polemical publique
ſword of the whole Kingdom, 'tis an aggregative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound

made up of all the ammunition and armes ſmall and great,
of all the military ſtrengths both by Land and Sea, of all
the Forts, Caſtles and tenable places within and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the whole Ile: The Kings of England have had this
ſword by vertue of their royall ſignory from all times,
the Laws have girded it to their ſides, they have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it for repelling all forren force, for revenging all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
wrongs or affronts, for quelling all inteſtine tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
and for protecting the weal of the whole body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike
at home: The peeple were never capable of this
ſword, the fundamentall conſtitutions of this Kingdom
deny it them; 'tis all one to put the ſword in a mad mans
hand, as in the peeples; or for them to have a diſpoſing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:162233:6"/>
power in whoſe hands it ſhall be. Such was the caſe once
of the French ſword, in that notorious inſurrection call'd
to this day <hi>La Jaqueris de Beauvoiſin,</hi> when the Peſants and
Mechanics had a deſign to wreſt it out of the Kings hand,
and to depreſſe all the Peers &amp; Gentry of the Kingdom;
&amp; the buſines had gone very far, had not the <hi>Prelats</hi> ſtuck
cloſe to the Nobility; But afterwards poor hare-brain'd
things they deſire the King upon bended knees to take
it againe; Such popular puffs have blowen often in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Naples</hi> and other places, where while they ſought
and fought for liberty by retrenching the regall power,
they fool'd themſelfs into a ſlavery unawares, and
found the rule right, that <hi>exceſs of freedom turns to thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and uſhers in all confuſions. If one ſhold go back
to the nonage of the world, when Governers and Rulers
began firſt, one will find the peeple deſir'd to live under
Kings for their own advantage, that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
from wild exorbitant liberty, and kept in unity;
Now <hi>unity</hi> is as requiſit for the welbeing of all naturall
things, as <hi>entity</hi> is for their being, and 'tis a receiv'd max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im
in policy, that nothing preſerves Unity more exactly
then Royall Government: beſides 'tis known to be the
nobleſt ſort of ſway; In ſo much that by the Law of
Nations, if Subjects of equall degrees, and under differing
Princes ſhold meet, the Subjects of a King ſhold take pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of thoſe under any Republique, and thoſe of a <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsif</hi>
Kingdom, of thoſe that are under an Electif.</p>
            <p>But to take up the <hi>Sword</hi> again. I ſay that the <hi>Sword</hi> of
public power &amp; authoritie is fit only to hang at the Kings
ſide, &amp; ſo indeed ſhold the <hi>great Seal</hi> hang only at his gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
becauſe 'tis the Key of the Kingdom: which makes me
think of what I read of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> how he had the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Seal emboſs'd alwaies upon the pommell of his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:162233:6"/>
ſword, and his reaſon was, that he was ready to maintain
whatſoever he ſigned, and ſealed.</p>
            <p>The Civilians, who are not in all points ſo great friends
to Monarchy as the Common Law of England is, ſay,
there are ſix<hi> lura Regalia, </hi>ſix Regall Rights,<hi> viz. 1. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtas
Iudicatoria, 2. Poteſtas vitae &amp; necis, 3. Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta,
4. Bona adeſpota, 5. Cenſus, 6. Monetarum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor:</hi>to wit,<hi> Power of Judicature, power of life and death,
all kind of arming, maſterleſſe goods, Seſſements, </hi>and<hi> the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among theſe <hi>Regalias,</hi> we find that <hi>Arming,</hi> which in
effect is nought elſe but the Kings <hi>Sword,</hi> is among the
chiefeſt; and 'tis as proper and peculiar to his perſon, as
either Crown or Scepter. By theſe two he drawes a looſe
voluntary love and opinion onely from his Subjects, but
by the <hi>Sword</hi> he drawes reverence and awe, which are the
chiefeſt ingredients of allegiance, it being a maxime,
<hi>That the beſt mixture of government is made of feare and
love.</hi> With this ſword he conferrs honor, he dubbs
Knights, he creates magiſtrats, the Lord Deputy of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Lord Mayor of London with all other Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
have their ſwords from him, and when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth
any place corporat, we know the firſt thing that is
preſented him is the <hi>Sword:</hi> With this Sword he ſhields
and preſerves all his peeple that ev'ry one may ſit quietly
under his own Vine, ſleep ſecurely in his own Houſe,
and enjoy ſweetly the fruits of his labours.</p>
            <p>Nor doth the point of this ſword reach only to ev'ry
corner of his own dominions, but it extends beyond the
ſeas to gard his Subjects from oppreſſion, and denial of
juſtice, as well as to vindicate the publike wrongs, make
good the intereſts of his Crown, and to aſſiſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates;
This is the ſword that <hi>Edward</hi> the third tied the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:162233:7"/>
               <hi>Flower deluces</hi> unto (which ſtick ſtill unto it,) when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſent to France to demand that Crown by maternall
right, the Counſell there ſent him word that the <hi>Crown of
France was not tied to a d<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtaff,</hi> to which <hi>ſcoffing</hi> anſwer he
replied <hi>that then he wold tie it to his ſword,</hi> and he was as
good as his word. Nor is this publike ſword concredited
or intruſted by the <hi>peeple</hi> in a fiduciary conditionall way
to the King, but it is properly and peculiarly belonging
unto him, as an inſeparable concomitant, perpetuall Uſher
and attendant to his Crowne. The King, we know, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to maintain all garriſons upon his own charge, not the
peeples; he fortifies upon his own charge, not the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
And though I will not averr, that the King may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
any of his Subjects, unleſſe it be upon an actuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
by Sea, or a ſudden irruption into his Kingdom
by Land, as the Scots have often don, yet at any time the
King may raiſe Volunteers, and thoſe who have received
his money, the Law makes it <hi>felony,</hi> if they forſake his
ſervice.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee there's nothing that conduceth more to the
glory, and indeed the very eſſence of a King then the
<hi>Sword,</hi> which is the Armes and military ſtrength of his
Kingdome; wherfore under favor, there cannot be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
point of diſhonor to a King then to be diſarmed,
then to have his Sword taken from him, or diſpos'd of
and intruſted to any but thoſe whom he ſhall appoint;
for as <hi>à minori ad majus</hi> the Argument often holds, if a
privat Gentleman chance to be diſarm'd upon a quarrell,
'tis held the utmoſt of diſgraces, much greater and more
public is the diſhonor that falls upon a King, if after
ſome traverſes of difference 'twixt him and his Subjects,
they ſhold offer to diſarme him, or demand his ſword of
him: when the Eagle parted with his talons, and the
Lion with his teeth and ongles, the Apolog tells us how
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:162233:7"/>
contemptible afterwards the one grew to be among
Birds, the other among Beaſts. For a King to part with
the Sword politic is to render himſelf ſuch a ridiculous
King, as that logg of wood was which <hi>Jupiter</hi> let down
among the froggs for their King at the importunity of
their croaking; 'tis to make him a King of clouts, or as
the Spaniard hath it, <hi>Rey de Havas,</hi> a Bean-King, ſuch as
we uſe to chooſe in ſport at Twelf-night.</p>
            <p>But my hopes are, that the two preſent Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement
(for now they may be call'd ſo, becauſe they begin
to <hi>parley</hi> with their King,) wilbe more tender of the honor
of their Soverain Liege Lord, which, together with all
his Rights and Dignities, by ſeverall ſolemn Oaths, and
by their own binding inſtruments of <hi>Proteſtation and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
(not yet revok'd) they are ſworn to maintain, and
that they will demand nothing of him which may ſavour
of <hi>Aſpertè</hi> or force, but what may hold water hereafter:
But now, touching the <hi>Militia</hi> or Sword of the Kingdom,
I think, under favor, the King cannot transfer it to any
other; for that were to deſert the protection of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which is point-blank againſt his Coronation Oath
and his Office: What forren Prince or State will ſend
either <hi>Ambaſſador, Reſident</hi> or <hi>Agent</hi> to him, when they
underſtand his Sword is taken from him? What reformed
forren Church wil acknowledg Him <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi>
when they hear of this? Nay, they who wiſh England
no good will, will go neer to paint him out, as not long
ſince another King was, with a fair velvet Scabbard, a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
golden hilt and chape, but the blade within was of
wood. I hope that they who ſway now, will make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
uſe of their ſucceſſes: Many of them know 'tis as <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
a thing to uſe a victory well, as to get one;</hi> there is as
much prudence requir'd in the one, as proweſſe in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:162233:8"/>
they wilbe wiſer ſure then turn it to the diſhonor
of their King: it being a certaine rule, that the glory of a
Nation all the world over depends upon the glory of
their King, and if he be any way obſcur'd, the whole
Kingdom is under an eclipſe.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved, that among other characters of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
which forren Writers appropriat to the Engliſh
Nation, one is, that they uſe to be moſt zealous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Honor of their King; I truſt that they who are
now upp will return to the ſteps of their Progenitors, both
in this particular and divers other; that their ſucceſſes may
ſerve to ſweeten and moderat things, and ſuppreſſe the
popular Sword which ſtill rages; And it had been hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiſhed that a ſuſpenſion of Arms had preceded this
Treaty, which uſeth to be the ordinary fore-runner, and
a neceſſarie antecedent to all Treaties; for while acts of
hoſtility continue, ſom ill favour'd newes may intervene
which may imbitter and diſturb all: nor can it be expected
that the proceedings will goe on with that candor and
confidence, while the old rancor is ſtill in action; 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
a ſore ſhold heale till the inflamation be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
To caſt <hi>water</hi> into a wound inſtead of <hi>oyle</hi> is not the
way to cure it: or to caſt <hi>oyle</hi> upon a fire inſtead of <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
is not the way to quench it; poor England hath had a
conſuming fire within her bowells many yeeres, ſhe is
alſo mortally wounded in all her members, that ſhe is
ſtill in a high Fever, which hath made her rave and ſpeak
idle a long time; and 'tis like to turn to a <hi>Hectic</hi> if not

            </p>
            <p>To conclude in a word, there is but one only way, under

favor, to put a period to all theſe fearfull confuſions; it is,
to put the great Maſter-wheele in order, and in its due
place again, and then all the inferior wheels will move
regularly; let the King be reſtor'd, and ev'ry one will com
to his own, all intereſts will be ſatisfied, all things quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rectified; till this be done, 'tis as abſurd to attempt the
ſetling of peace, as if one ſhold go about to ſet a Watch by
