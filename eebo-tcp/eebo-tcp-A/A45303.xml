            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Earned and Reverend Brethren; If you be now (as is ſuppoſed) upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of a Forme of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I beſeech you, in the feare of God, ſetting aſide all prejudice, to take into your ſad thoughts theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions following.</p>
            <p>It is (I perceive) an uſuall Prayer of many Preachers well affected to your Aſſembly, that God would now (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 1600 yeares univerſall practice of the whole Church of Chriſt, upon earth) ſhew you the patterne in the mount; as if, after ſo long and perfect inquiſitions, there could be any new diſcoveries of the forme that was, or ſhould be; wherein, I ſuppoſe their well-meaning is not a little injurious both to the knowne truth, and to you: for, what revelations can we expect thus late? or what monuments of either Scripture, or hiſtory can now be hoped to be brought to light, which your eyes have not ſeene, and former ages have not inquired into?
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50970:3"/>
Surely, ye well know, there can be but theſe three forms of Church-government, poſſibly deviſed; Either by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or by Presbyteries, or by the multitude of ſeveral and ſelect congregations: Every of which, have both their abettors, and thei<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> adverſaries; The firſt hath all times, and places, ſince the dayes of the bleſſed Apoſtles, till this age, to ſtand for it; The ſecond hath the late perſecuted, reformed Church of <hi>France,</hi> (which never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, nor meant to make their neceſſitated forme, a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for others) the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> for prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of it; The third hath the Miniſters of <hi>New-England,</hi> and their Aſſociates, commonly ſtyled by the name of INDEPENDENTS, vehemently contending for it: The adverſaries of every of theſe are as well known, as their friends; and the pleas, which every of them makes for it ſelfe, are as well known as either.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it is yet <hi>res integra</hi>; elſe, I ſhould lay my finger upon my lips; Both the Houſes of Parliament, your Aſſembly, and the whole Kingdome, ſtand yet free, and unengaged to any part: For the National Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (as it is interpreted by ſome of your ſelves, and thoſe other Divines whoſe allowed Sermons have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented upon it) intends not to abjure, and diſclaime Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacie, as ſuch; but only bends againſt the whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fabrick of Government, as it is built on theſe Arches, theſe Pedeſtalls; ſo as if it be taken aſunder from thoſe (ſome of them, not neceſſary) appendances, you are no way forſtalled in your judgement againſt it; nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hath lift up his hand in this ſolemne Covenant.</p>
            <p>That I may not urge the Latine Tranſlation of the ſame Covenant, printed and ſent abroad to the Low-Countries and France, and other Churches, which ran onely upon <hi>tyrannicum regimen Epiſcoporum</hi>; that onely
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50970:3"/>
the Tyrannicall Government of the Prelates, not their fatherly and brotherly preeminence, is there abjured.</p>
            <p>Your wiſdomes know well how to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Calling, and the abuſes of the execution thereof; betwixt the maine ſubſtance of a Calling, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiall and ſeparable appurtenances thereunto; from which it may be deveſted, and yet ſtand intire.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be a flatterer of the times paſt (which is not often ſeene) if I ſhould take upon me to juſtifie, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of all the carriages of ſome that have been entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Keyes of Eccleſiaſticall Government; or to blanch over the Corruptions of Conſiſtoriall Officers; in both theſe, there was fault enough, to ground both a complaint, and Reformation; and, may that man never proſper, that deſires not an happy Reformation of what ever hath been, or is amiſſe in the Church of God; But this I offer to your ſerious conſideration, whether Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacie, ſtripped of all circumſtances that may be juſtly excepted againſt, and reduced to the Primitive eſtate, may not be thought a forme, both better in it ſelfe, and more fit for this Kingdome and Church, then either of the other.</p>
            <p>How ancient it is, I need not appeale to any but your ſelves, who doe well know, that there was never yet any Hiſtory of the Church, wherein there was not full men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of Biſhops, as the onely Governours thereof; neither can any learned adverſary deny, that they have continued, with the generall allowance of Gods Church, from the very Apoſtolike times, untill this preſent age. And whether it can be ſafe, and, lye not open to much ſcandall, to exchange ſo ancient an inſtitution hitherto perpetuated to the Church, for a new, where no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity inforces us, judge ye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50970:4"/>How univerſall it is, being the onely received govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Chriſtian Churches over the face of the whole earth, (excepting onely this ſmall ſpot of our neighbourhood) ye know as well, as the undoubted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>Chriſtianographie</hi> can tell you: and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe it may be, to depart from the forme of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that profeſſe the name of Chriſt, (who doe all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to Biſhops, or Superintendents, except the fore-excepted) I leave to your grave judgement.</p>
            <p>Beſides, how Epiſcopacie is, and hath long been ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this Kingdome, and (as it were) incorporated into it; and enwoven into the municipall Laws of this Land, ſo as that it cannot be utterly removed, without much alteration in the whole body of our Lawes; is a matter well worthy of not the leaſt conſideration.</p>
            <p>But, all theſe would yet ſeeme light upon the Balance, if there were not an intrinſecall worth in the inſtitution it ſelfe, that might ſway with you: The Covenant bindes to the indeavour of ſuch a Government, as is according to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches. And now, let me appeale to your owne hearts, and the hearts of all judicious and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Readers, whether the rules of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, laid forth in the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> doe not ſuppoſe, and import that very proper juriſdiction, which is claimed by Epiſcopacie at this day: Which, if it were not intended to be left as a perfect pattern to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; the whole Church of Chriſt ſhould have been left in the dark, without any direction for the ſucceeding adminiſtration thereof: Thoſe charges are plainly given, not to many, but to one; and doe moſt manifeſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply not a parity, but preeminence and power.</p>
            <p>And if the example of the beſt Churches muſt carry
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50970:4"/>
it: What Church could be more pure, and more fit for our imitation, then the Primitive? and that part of it which immediately followed the Apoſtles of our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt? And doe not you full wel know, that our Hiſtories, and unqueſtionable Authors name the men, whom thoſe Apoſtles, by impoſition of hands, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to this function? Do not <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Polycrates, Egeſippus, Clemens, Euſebius, Ierome</hi> inſtance in thoſe perſons, who ſucceeded each other in thoſe firſt Sees? If you tell me of the difference betwixt the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacie of thoſe firſt Ages of the Church, and that of the preſent times; I doe willingly yeeld it, but, withall, I muſt adde, that it is not in any thing eſſentiall to the calling, but in matters outward, and meerly adventitious; the abatement whereof (if it ſhall be found needfull) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth nothing from the ſubſtance of that holy inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; What can be more expreſſe, then, in the ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them, the bleſſed Martyr, <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the mention of the three diſtinct degrees of Biſhops, Presbyters, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons; encharged with their ſeverall duties which were yet never intermitted, and let fall to this preſent day; How frequently, and vehemently doth he in his genuine Epiſtles (twice in that to the <hi>Epheſians</hi>) call for due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Biſhop and the Presbyterie? How diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Magneſians,</hi> name their Biſhop, <hi>Dama</hi>; and their Presbyters, <hi>Baſſus, Apollonius, Stephanus?</hi> How doth he in his Epiſtle <hi>Ad Trallianos</hi> ſet forth the Biſhop <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. And if any man ſhall be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſcrupulous, as to call into queſtion the credit of this gracious Author, (reſerved, no doubt, by a ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, for the conviction of the ſchiſmes of theſe laſt times) therein out-doing <hi>Vedelius</hi> himſelfe, (who ſtoutly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50970:5"/>
aſſerteth ſome of theſe Epiſtles, whiles he rejects others as ſuppoſitious) let him caſt his eyes upon the no leſſe famous, and holy Martyr, and Biſhop, <hi>Polycarpus</hi>; who (as <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iren. adverſ. Haereſ. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> an unqueſtionable Author tels us, one, whoſe eyes beheld that Saint) did not onely converſe with thoſe that had ſeene Chriſt, but alſo was by the Apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in <hi>Aſia,</hi> Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> Let him, if he can, deny <hi>Cyprian</hi> the holy Martyr and Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> writing familiarly to the Presbyters, and Deacons there; ſometimes gravely reproving them; ſometimes fatherly admoniſhing them of their duties; in divers of his Epiſtles. Let him deny, that his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poranye <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> acknowledgeth 46. Presbyters committed by the Catholique Church, to his charge: Shortly, let him, if he ſtick at this truth, deny that there was any Chriſtian Church of old, any Hiſtorie.</p>
            <p>All which duly conſidered, I would faine know what reaſon can be ſhewed, why that ancient, yea firſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Biſhop and his Presbyterie, received, and with all good approbation and ſucceſſe, uſed in the Primitive Church, and derived (though not without ſome faulty omiſſions, and intertextures, which may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be remedied) untill this preſent day, ſhould not rather take place; then a government lately, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally raiſed up in the Church, for the neceſſity, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of ſome ſpeciall places, and perſons; without any intention of an univerſall rule and preſcription.</p>
            <p>If you ſhall ſay that this Government by Biſhops hath been found, by ſad experience, hitherto, a block in the way of perfect Reformation, deſtructive to the power of Godlineſſe, and pure Adminiſtration of the Ordinances of Chriſt; give me leave to anſwer; That, firſt, I feare,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50970:5"/>
the Independent part, will be apt to ſay no leſſe of the Presbyterian; boldly preſſing their defects, both in conſtitution, and practice; and publiquely averring, the exquiſitely-reformed way to lye betwixt the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopall,</hi> and <hi>Calvinian,</hi> which they have had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe to light upon; neither want there, thoſe, who, upon challenge of further illumination, taxe thoſe Semi-ſepariſts, as comming far too ſhort of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Reformation, which themſelves have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I muſt, in the feare of God, beſeech you here to make uſe of that neceſſary diſtinction, betwixt Callings, and Perſons; for it oftentimes fals out, that the Calling unjuſtly ſuffers for that, whereof onely the Perſon is guilty; Let the Calling be never ſo holy, &amp; the rules of Adminiſtration never ſo wiſe, and perfect; yet if the perſon, in whoſe truſt they are, be either neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, or corrupt, or impotent in ordering his paſſions and carriage, it cannot be but all things muſt goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, and much diſorder and confuſion muſt needs follow to the Church of God; and if ſuch hath been the caſe in ſome late times, why ſhould the blame be laid upon the Calling, which both is innocent, and might have been better improved? Give me a Biſhop (ſuch there have been, and ſuch there are, let D. <hi>Potter</hi> the late Biſhop of <hi>Carlile,</hi> for inſtance, be one) that is truly conſcionable, pious, painfull, zealous in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the glory of God, ready to encourage all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Preachers, and to cenſure and correct the lazie, and ſcandalous; carefull of the due impoſition of his hands; meek and unblameable in all his carriage; and now tell me how the government of ſuch an one (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated

by the holy and wholſome Lawes of our Church) can be ſaid to be obſtructive to the ſucceſſe of the Goſpel, or to deſtroy the power of Godlines? certainly, if all be not ſuch, the fault is in the Men; their Calling doth not onely admit of, but incites them to all vertue and goodneſſe; whereof if they be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, let the Perſon take off the blame from the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Neither doubt I to affirme, that it may well be made good, that the perfecteſt Reformation, which the Church of God can be capable of, here upon earth, may conſiſt with Epiſcopacie, ſo regulated, as it may be, if it pleaſe the High Court of Parliament to pitch upon that courſe: And indeed how can it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the carefull inſpection of one conſtant, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and vigilant overſeer, ſuper-added to a grave and judicious Presbyterie, ſhould be any hindrance to the progreſſe of godlineſſe? eſpecially, when he is ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the bounds of good lawes and conſtitutions, that he cannot run out, without the danger of a juſt cenſure; There are already many excellent rules of Government, if they were awaked, and actuated by full authority; and, where there is any deficiency, more might be eaſily added to make the body of Church-lawes complete.</p>
            <p>To give a taſte of what may be effected, with very little or no alteration of one Forme of Government to another.</p>
            <p>I remember one of our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in a Diſcourſe tending to the advancing of the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an way, tells us, that Dr. <hi>Montague,</hi> the late worthy Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> asked King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50970:6"/>
(whoſe ſweet affability the world well knew) <hi>How it came about, that there were ſo few hereſies, and errors of doctrine, broached, and proſecuted, to the publique diſturbance of the Church of Scotland?</hi> Unto which, the wiſe and learned King is ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned this Anſwer; <hi>That every Pariſh hath their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, ever preſent with them, and watching over them; That the Paſtor hath his Elders and Deacons, ſorted with him; That he with them, once a week, meets at a ſet time and place, for the cenſure of manners, or what ever diſorder falls out in the Pariſh; ſo as he, by this meanes, perfectly knowes his flock; and every aberration of them, either in matter of opinion, or practice: And, leſt any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or Hereſie may ſeize upon the Paſtor; they have their Presbyteries, conſiſting of ſeverall Shrivalties, which meet together in the chiefe Towne or City next to them, every week alſo once; and have there their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Prophecying; after which, the Moderator of the ſaid Meeting asks and gathers the judgements of all the ſaid Paſtors, concerning the doctrine then delivered, or, of any other doubtfull point, that is then and there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; And if the ſaid Presbyters be divided in their opinions, then the Queſtion is, under an injoyned ſilence, put over to the next Synode, which is held twice a yeare; unto that all the Paſtors of that Quarter, or Province duly reſort; accompanyed with their Elders; The Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the former Synode begins the Action; then a new Moderator is choſen for the preſent, or (as it ſeldome falls out) the laſt Moderator, by Voices, continued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Any Queſtion of doubt being propoſed, is either decided by that meeting, or (if it cannot be ſo done) is, with charge of ſilence, reſerved till the Nationall Synode, or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50970:7"/>
Generall Aſſembly; which they hold every yeare once; Whither come not the Paſtors onely, but the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or his Commiſsioners; and ſome of all Orders and Degrees, ſufficiently authorized for the determining of any Controverſie, that ſhall ariſe amongſt them.</hi> Thus he. And certainly this beares the face of a very faire and laudable courſe, and ſuch, as deſerves the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the wel-willers to that diſcipline: But let me adde, that we either have, or may have, (in this very ſame ſtate of things, with ſome ſmall variation) in effect, the ſame Government with us; onely there wants ſome care and life in their execution, which might, without much difficulty, be redreſſed; Every pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh hath, or by Law ought to have their Miniſter ever preſent with them; and carefully watching over them. In ſtead then of their Paſtor, Elders, and Deacons; we have in every Pariſh, the Miniſter, whether a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, or Vicar; Churchwardens, Queſtmen, or Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Overſeers for the Poore; and in places of any eminence, a Curate or Aſſiſtent to the Rector, who is a Deacon at leaſt; Theſe may, and ought, and, in ſome places, doe duly meet together, every week, on a ſet day, in their Veſtry; and decide ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences as happen amongſt them; and may well be enjoyned, to take notice of ſuch abuſes and miſ-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours, as are incident into their pariſh, for their ſpeedy reformation, within the Verge of their owne power.</p>
            <p>In ſtead of their Presbyteries, conſiſting of ſeverall paſtors, we have our number, and combination of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in the diviſions of our ſeverall Deanries; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which, are ranged all the Miniſters within that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50970:7"/>
circuit; Over whom the Rurall Deane (as he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) is every year choſen, by the ſaid Miniſters of that diviſion, as their moderator, for the yeare enſuing; whoſe office (if it were carefully looked unto, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the originall inſtitution) might be of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſe to Gods Church; This Deanry, or Presbytery, conſiſting of ſeverall paſtors, may be injoyned to meet together every moneth, or oftner (if it ſeeme fit) in ſome city or town next unto them; and may there have their exerciſe of propheſying, as I have known it practiced in ſome parts of this kingdom; and as it is earneſtly wiſhed and recommended, by that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently-Learned Lord, <hi>Verulame,</hi> late Lord Chancelour of <hi>England,</hi> in his prudent Conſiderations: and then, and there, may indevour to decide any doubt, that may ariſe in their ſeverall pariſhes; either concerning the doctrine of their Miniſter, or ſcruple in caſes of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and may tranſact any publique buſineſſe that may concerne their whole diviſion; But if any ſuch matter or queſtion ſhould ariſe, as their divided opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot fully determine; it may (under charge of ſilence) be put over to a more publique meeting; which is the ſynodall aſſembly of the Clergy held twice a yeare, under the moderation (hitherto) of the Archdeacon; And if there the queſtion fayle, of a full determination, it is, or may be referred, (with like ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and peace) to a Dioceſan Synode, which may be held every yeare once; under the preſidency of the Biſhop; And if yet the deciſion come not home, it may be referred to the determining of a Provinciall Synod, or yet higher, to a Nationall: So as in theſe caſes of doubts, or errors, if men would not be wanting to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50970:8"/>
themſelves, nothing needs to be wanting in the ſtate we now ſtand in, to the ſafety, and happineſſe of our Church.</p>
            <p>For matter of Ordination of Miniſters; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Conſtitutions of our Church, have deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the preſence, and aſſiſtance of thoſe, who by their originall inſtitution, are the Presbyterie of the Biſhop, at, and, in, the examination, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the perſons to be ordained; requiring alſo, the joynt-impoſition of thoſe hands, which atteſted the ſufficiency of the ſaid Examinates; not without a ſevere ſanction of two yeares ſuſpenſion, of the act of Ordaining, to paſſe upon any Biſhop, or Suffragane, that ſhall be found failing in any of the particulars; The qualification of thoſe that are to be ordained, is in our Canons already ſet forth, with much caution; for their age, their degrees, their abilities, the teſtimonie of their holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; neither need I doubt to affirm, that he, who (beſides all other circumſtances of education) is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give a good account of his faith in Latine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the received Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to confirme the ſame by ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, out of the holy Scripture, may be thought competently fit, (for matter of knowledge) to enter upon the firſt ſtep of Deaconſhip; which the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Church hath (according to the Apoſtles rule) appointed (not without a ſufficient diſtance of time) in way of probation, to the higher order of Miniſtery; forbidding to give both orders at once; and requiring, that he, who is ordained Deacon, ſhall continue a whole yeare, at leaſt, in that ſtation, except, upon ſome weighty reaſons, it ſhall ſeeme fit to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50970:8"/>
Biſhop, to contract the time limited: And, leſt there ſhould be any ſubreption in this ſacred buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it is Ordered, that theſe Ordinations ſhould be no other then ſolemne, both in reſpect of time and place; neither ought they to be, nor in ſome places are, without a publique preconization of lawfull warning affixed upon the Cathedrall Church doore, where the ſaid Ordination ſhall be celebrated; and over and beſides the charge, that none ſhall be admitted to be a Candidate of holy Orders, but he who brings ſufficient teſtimonials of his good life and converſation, under the ſeale of ſome Colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi> or <hi>Oxford,</hi> or of three, or foure grave Miniſters, together with the ſubſcription and teſtimonie of other credible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who have known his life and behaviour, by the ſpace of three yeeres next before; it is well knowne to you, that before the Act of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is publique Proclamation made to the whole Aſſembly, that if any man knowes any crime or impediment in any of the perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, for which he ought not to be ordained, that hee ſhould come forth and declare it before any hand be laid upon his head, for his full ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all which care of our deare Mother the Church of England; if it ſhall bee thought meet, that any further act of Tryall, ſhall paſſe upon thoſe, which are ſuitors for Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how eaſily may it be ordered, that at the monethly (or, if need be, more frequent) meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Miniſters, within the ſame Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50970:9"/>
or Deanrie; they may be appointed to make tryall of their gifts, and undergoe ſuch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination of their abilities, as ſhall bee thought requiſite, ere they ſhall be preſented, and admitted by the Biſhop, and his Presbyterie to that holy function.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is much ſtood upon, that it is meet the people, (whoſe ſoules muſt have right in him, to whoſe truſt they are committed) ſhould have ſome hand in their conſent to that Paſtor, by whom they muſt be fed; it muſt be ſaid, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their devolution of their right to the patron, who, as their truſtee, preſents a Miniſter for them, it may be no prejudice at all to the power which by Law and inheritance is ſetled upon the patron, that the perſon whom his choyce pitches upon, be appointed before hand to preach, (for a triall) to that congregation to which he is ſo deſigned, and if either for his voice, or other juſt exceptions he be found unmeet for them, that another, more fit may be recommended by the ſaid Patron to the place; but if through faction, or ſelf-will, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie, the multitude ſhall prove pe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>viſh, and faſtidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they may, in ſuch a caſe, be over-ruled by juſt authority.</p>
            <p>As for matter of cenſures, it may not be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there hath been great abuſe in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of them, both upon Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and others: ſuſpenſion of Miniſters upon ſlight, and inſufficient cauſes; both <hi>ab officio,</hi> and <hi>beneficio,</hi> hath been too rife in ſome places of later times; and the dreadfull ſentence of Excommunication hath too
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50970:9"/>
frequently, and familiarly paſſed upon light and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall matters: How happy were it, if a ſpeedy courſe may be taken, for the prevention of this evil; In the conference at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> a motion was ſtrongly made to this purpoſe, but without effect; if the wiſedom of the preſent Parliament ſhall ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſome other way for the curbing of contumati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offences againſt Church-authority, it will be an act worthy of their care and juſtice. In the meane time, as for this, and all other Eccleſiaſticall proceedings, it may with much facility, and willing conſent of all parts, be ordered, that the Biſhop ſhal not take upon him, to inflict either this, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther important cenſure, without the concurrence of his Presbitery; which ſhall be a meanes (in all likelyhood) to prevent any inconvenience that may ariſe from the wonted way of Judicature.</p>
            <p>As for the co-aſſeſſion of a Lay-presbyterie, in ſwaying theſe affaires of Church-government; Ye well know how new it is; ſome of you might have been acquainted with the man that brought it firſt into any part of this Iſland; and what ground there is for it, either in Scripture, or antiquity, I appeale to your judgement: Surely, the late lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Author of the Counſaile for the reforming the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (although otherwiſe a vehement aſſertor of the French Diſcipline) inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly confeſſeth, that however thoſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants which live under Popiſh Governours, have done wiſely, in deputing ſome choiſe men, ſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of their congregations, whom they call Elders, to ſhare with their paſtors, in the care
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50970:10"/>
and management of Eccleſiaſticall affaires; Yet, thoſe Proteſtant Churches which live under the government of Proteſtant Princes, may with the ſafety of thoſe reſpects, which mutually intercede betwixt Paſtors and people, forbeare any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: for as much, as the ſupreme Magiſtrate, transfers (for the moſt part) to himſelfe, that, which is the wonted charge of thoſe deputed El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; concluding, that thoſe men, do meerely loſe their labour, who ſo buſily indevour on the one ſide, to diſprove the antiquity of the Lay-Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and, on the other, by weak proofes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, (cleane contrary to the minde of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) that the text of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.) is to be underſtood of Paſtors, and Lay-Elders; Thus he; with what faire probability, I leave to your judgment.</p>
            <p>Neither is it any intention of mine to meddle with any piece of that government, which obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in other the Churches of God; but onely, to contribute my poor opinion, concerning the now-to-be-ſetled affaires of our own.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I need to ſuggeſt unto you the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous under-workings of other Sects? ſecretly indevouring to ſpring their hidden mines to the overthrow both of the one government, and the other; whereof, without ſpeedy remedy, perhaps it will be too late to complaine; no doubt, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and authority of that great Senate (whom ye alſo ſerve to adviſe) will forthwith interpoſe it ſelf to the prevention of thoſe miſchiefes, which the variety of theſe hereſies, and ſects (though ſome of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50970:10"/>
them cloaked with the fayreſt pretences) threaten to this poor Church: It is no boot for me to tel you, that the leſſe diſunion there is, the more ground of ſafety; and that where the holy purpoſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation may be effected, with the leaſt change, there muſt needs be the moſt hope of accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>The reſt to the wiſe application of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and judicious; It is enough for me to have thus boldly ſhot my bolt amongſt you; and to have thus freely diſcovered my honeſt, and well meant thoughts to ſo able judgments; What I want in my poor indevours ſhall be ſupplyed with my prayers, that God would be pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all our miſerable diſtractions, and to put an happy iſſue, to the long and perilous agitations of this wofully tottering and bleeding Church and Kingdome; Which the good God of heaven vouchſafe to grant for his great mercies ſake, and for the ſake of the dear Sonne of his love Jeſus Chriſt, the Juſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>
