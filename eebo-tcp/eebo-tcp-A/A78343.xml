            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVE read how that in the laſt daies many falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, and many ſhall ſay, Loe here is Chriſt, loe there is Chriſt, and ſhall deceive many, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. there were falſe Prophets alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, as there ſhall bee falſe teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had need to be eſtabliſhed in the truth, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. ſtand faſt in the faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Let that therefore abide in you which yee have heard from the beginning, and yee shall continue in the Sonne and in the Father;</hi> Verſ. 25. <hi>Theſe things I have written unto you, concerning them that seduce you.</hi> Many, ſtrange Sects and Opinions are held amongſt us, ſo that it is to be feared, that what rule ſoever our wiſe and honourable Parliament ſhall eſtabliſh it will not content the unquiet ſpirits of a lawleſſe generation, which would have no rule; for ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rule in the Church they will call it perſecution, and they ſay they diſlike ſome things commanded becauſe they are Impoſed. Some there are that looke for a Temporall Kingdome of Chriſt, that ſhall laſt a thouſand years this opinion is moſt dangerous for all States, for they teach that all the ungodly muſt be killed, and that the wicked have no propriety in their eſtates Others out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that they are ruled by the ſpirit, deſpite all ordinary calling to the Miniſtry, all written pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, all helps of ſtudy: Some make no conſcience to heare and ſing Pſalms, but rather follow their own inventions, as he that would not believe the ſun becauſe it went not with his watch: Likewiſe this ordinary ſaying of theirs; Be in Chriſt and ſin if thou canſt; meaning, that regenerate men cannot ſinne; this is the Doctrine of the Anabaptiſts: alſo that to receive the Communion with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon, is to partake of his ſinne; that the Lords Prayer was never taught to be ſaid; that the Goſpell was never purely taught ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times; that a liberty of Prophecying muſt be allowed; that all humane Lawes muſt be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished; that Miniſters of Gods Word ſhould rule both the Spirituall and the Temporall; that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Pariſhes is Antichriſtian. Should theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and groſſe opinions take place, what diviſion and confuſion would they work amongſt us? but ſuch is the wiſdome and care of our worthy and pious Parliament, to provide an Ordinance for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of the growing and ſpreading of hereſie.</p>
