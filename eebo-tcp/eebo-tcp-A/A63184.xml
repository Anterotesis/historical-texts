            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, This is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation againſt <hi>Nathaniel Thompſon, William Pain</hi> and <hi>John Farwell,</hi> for Printing and Publiſhing ſeveral Scandalous Libels about the Death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey;</hi> whereas we are ſatisfied that <hi>Green, Berry</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> were Indicted, Tryed and found Guilty, and Executed for the Murder of the ſame perſon, upon the Tryal of the ſame matter, ſeveral Witneſſes were Examined, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> and others; and by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the Coroners it appears that the ſaid Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> was killed by perſons unknown, though after this it has ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared who were the Murderers, and ſome of them have received their due Reward for that ſo horrid a Crime, by the publick Juſtice of the Nation. Yet theſe Perſons have Maliciouſly Printed and expoſed ſeveral Scandalous Letters to Mr. <hi>Miles Prance,</hi> reflecting on Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> as if he had Murdered himſelf, and likewiſe on all the Witneſſes as if they had Contradicted themſelves in the Tryal of <hi>Green, Berry</hi> and <hi>Hill:</hi> Now if we can prove them Guilty of theſe Scandalous Libels remitted, we doubt not but you will find them Guilty of the matter of the Information.</p>

There was an Order to get him ſtript, I pull'd off his Shoes, his Shoes were <hi>clean,</hi> I pull'd off three pair of Stockings, and a pair of Socks, I pull'd off his black Breeches and Drawers, We ſet him on his breech upon the Table, with his Leggs hanging down, unbuttoned his Coat and Waſtcoat pull'd them off, but we could not bend his Arms when we came to his Shirt, ſo we tore it open. Upon his Back, there was ſome Blood, but upon his <hi>Flannel</hi> there was none. I have one thing more to ſay, There was a place Black round about his Throat, which looked as if he had been <hi>Strangled,</hi> and his Neck was weak and looſe, and had no ſtrength at all in it, by which <hi>its Evident he was Murdered.</hi>

Then I went where the Body lay, and view'd it. I ſaw two wounds under the left Pap, his Throat was <hi>black</hi> and blew upon opening the Collar near the breadth of an Hand, and his Face was very much ſwelled: I believe he was <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled by others,</hi> for I cannot believe all thoſe Injuries could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe attend him after he was dead.</p>

               <p>My Lord he was certainly <hi>ſtrangled,</hi> and ſometimes perſons may be <hi>ſtrangled</hi> and yet look pale: If that which ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled

him had been taken away while his Body was warm, the Veſſels would have been leſs, and his Face would have been very Pale: Therefore it's evident that that which <hi>ſtrangled</hi> him, was not removed till his Body was cold, which was the occaſion of that blackneſs; for the Knot remaining, the Blood could not run away: He had as high a Colour as if in a Scarlet Feavor; and the Blood that was ſeen by me four yards from the Ditch, I put my finger into it, and it ſmelt like Blood a fortnight or three Weeks from any Body. My Lord, I preſume it was Blood came off the Womb, &amp;c. His Neck was very much ſwell'd and black, on one ſide of his Mouth he was diſcoloured; where-ever any Man is bruiſed while he has life, or while warm, the parts ſo bruiſed when dead will ſooneſt corrupt; as is a common thing. Mr. <hi>Cheſs</hi> the Apothecary unbuttening his Collar found two great Creaſes about his Neck, and deſired me to come and ſee it; and the mark was like that of a ſtrait Ring upon a Finger, and while we with-drew to drink two or three Glaſſes of Beer, there remained only this Creaſe above.</p>

               <p>Here is a high Offence againſt the Government and Juſtice of the Nation, againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a Perſon of Worth and Integrity, after they had murdered his <hi>Perſon,</hi> to endevour the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his <hi>Good Name.</hi> Theſe perſons have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to manage it; all the Witneſſes Mr. <hi>Farewell</hi> has brought, have contradicted him in all he have ſaid. No <hi>Blood,</hi> no <hi>Fly-blows,</hi> but Stranglings, Stabs, and Bruiſes; and for a Man that ſhould ſtab himſelf, how could he bruiſe himſelf too in that manner? Yet they have aſſerted they would prove it by 500 Witneſſes, but could he produce but one ſubſtantial one, it were well for him. But what have he or they to do with a matter of this nature? The Juſtice of the Kingdom has paſt upon <hi>Green, Berry,</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> for the ſaid Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon <hi>Clear Evidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but ſuppoſe ſomething might have been ſaid, it became them not to arraign the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the Juſtice of the Kingdom in its Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations. Sir <hi>E. B. Godfrey</hi> was certainly murdered, and we know by whom. I'll produce two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that ſhall produce <hi>more than ever yet;</hi> and if there were no more, there would be Evidence enough.

All the Evidence they call, go as much againſt them as can be; the Evidence is as plain as the day that the Man was killed, and <hi>kill'd by Strangers.</hi> Beſides, Sirs, a private perſon muſt not undertake to controul the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Nation: To ſay he was a juſt perſon that ſuffered, and I will juſtifie it; this is not to be indured: but I was willing to hear all that could be ſaid, and whether a doubt could be made; and you ſee his very Evidence conclude him kill'd, and kill'd by Strangers. They are all Three in this Miſchief, there is a Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them to affront the Publick Juſtice of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the end of this Deſign is to make you believe here was no <hi>Popiſh Plot;</hi> the <hi>Snake</hi> lies under the
