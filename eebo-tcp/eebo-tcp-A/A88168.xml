            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Copie of a Letter, Written to the General from Lieut. Col. <hi>Iohn Lilburn,</hi> M. <hi>Richard Overton,</hi> April 27. 1649.</head>
            <head type="sub">In behalf of M. Robert Lockwer, M. Geo. Aſh, M. Joſeph Hockley, M. Robert Osburn, M. Matthew Heyworth, M. Thomas Goodwin; all of them in Captain Savages Troup: who by the ſaid Councel were adjudged to caſt lots for their lives, and one of them to dy.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>In which it is by Law fully proved, that it is both <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> for any General or Councel of War to execute any Souldier in time of Peace, by Martial Law.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>May it pleaſe your Excellency,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE have not yet forgot your Solemn Engagement of <hi>June</hi> 5. 1647. whereby the Armies Continuance as an Army was in no wiſe by the Will of the State, but by their own mutual Agreement: And if their ſtanding were removed from one Foundation to another (as is undeniable) then with the ſame they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from one Authority to another; and the Ligaments and Bounds of the Firſt were all Diſſolved, and gave place to the Second; and under, and from the head of their firſt Station, <hi>viz.</hi> By the Will of the State, the Army derived their Government by Martial Law; which in Iudgment and Reaſon could be no longer binding then the Authority (which gave being thereto) was binding to the Army: For the denial of the Authority, is an Abrogation and Nulment of all Acts, Orders, or Ordinances by that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as to them: And upon this account, your Excellency with the Army, long proceeded upon the Conſtitution of a new Councel and Government, contrary to all Martial Law and Diſcipline, by whom only the Army Engaged to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their proſecution of the ends, to wit, Their ſeveral Rights, both as Souldiers and Commoners, for which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated; Declaring, Agreeing, and Promiſing each other, not to Disband, Divide, or ſuffer themſelves to be Disbanded or Divided, without ſatisfaction and ſecurity in relation to their Grievances and Deſires in behalf of themſelves and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth as ſhould be agreed unto by their Councel of Agitators: And by vertue, and under Colour of this Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all the Extraordinary Actions by your Excellency, your Officers, and the Army have paſt: Your refuſal to Disband, diſpurings the Orders of Parliament; Impeachment and Ejection of Eleven Members; your Firſt and Second March up to London; your late violent Excluſion of the Major part of Members out of the Houſe, and their impriſonment without Cauſe, &amp;c. which can no way be juſtified from the Guilt of the higheſt Treaſon, but in the accompliſhment of a righteous end, <hi>viz.</hi> The enjoyment of the benefit of our Laws and Liberties which we hoped long ere this to have enjoyed from your hands; Yet when we conſider and herewith compare many of your late carriages both towards the Souldiery and other Free People; and principally your Cruel Exerciſe of Martial Law, even to the Sentence and Execution of Death upon ſuch of your Souldiers as ſtand for the Rights of that Engagement, &amp;c. And not only ſo, but againſt others not of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; we cannot but look upon your defection and Apoſtaſie in ſuch dealings, as of moſt dangerous Conſequence to all the Laws and Freedoms of the People.</p>
            <p>And therefore, although there had never bin any ſuch ſolemn Engagement by the Army, as that of <hi>June</hi> 5. 1647. which with your Excellency in point of duty ought not to be of the meaneſt obligation. We do proteſt againſt your Exerciſe of Martial Law, againſt any whomſoever, in times of Peace, where all Courts of Iuſtice are open, as the greateſt encroachment upon our Laws and Liberties that can be acted againſt us; And particularly, againſt the Tryal of the Souldiers of Captain <hi>Savages</hi> Troup yeſterday, by a Court Martial, upon the Articles of War, and ſentencing of two of them to death; and for no other end (as we underſtand) but for ſome diſpute about their pay: And the reaſon of this our Proteſtation, is from the Petition of Right, made in the third yeer of the late King, which declareth, <hi>That no perſon ought to be judged by Law Martial, except in times of War; And that all Commiſſions given to execute Martial Law in time of Peace, are contrary to the Laws and Statutes of the Land.</hi> And it was the Parliaments complaint, That Martial Law was then commanded to be executed upon Souldiers for Robbery, Mutiny, or Murder. Which Petition of Right, this preſent Parliament in their late Declarations of the 9. of Feb. and the 17. of March, 1648. commend as the moſt excellenteſt Law in England; and there promiſe to preſerve inviolably, it, and all other the Fundamental Laws and Liberties, concerning the preſervation of the Lives, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and Liberties of the people, with all things incident thereunto. And the Exerciſe of Martial Law in Ireland, in time of Peace, was one of the chiefeſt Articles for which the Earl of Strafford loſt his head; The ſame by this preſent Parliament being judged High Treaſon. And the Parliament it ſelf, neither by Act nor Ordinance, can juſtly or warrantably deſtroy the Fundamental Liberties and Principles of the Common Law of England: It being a <hi>maxime</hi> in Law and Reaſon both, that all ſuch Acts and Ordinances, are <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> null, and void in Law, and binds not at all, but ought to be reſiſted, and ſtood againſt to the death. And if the Supreme Authority may not preſume to do this, much leſs may You, or Your Officers preſume thereupon; For where Remedy may be had by an ordinary courſe in Law, the Party grieved ſhall never have his recourſe to extraordinaries. Whence it is evident, That it is the undoubted Right of every Engliſhman (Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or other) that he ſhould be puniſhable onely in the ordinary Courts of Iuſtice, according to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm in the times of Peace, as now it is; and the extraordinary way by Courts Martial, in no wiſe to be uſed.</p>
            <p>Yea, the Parliaments Oracle, Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> Declares in the third part of his <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> Chap. of <hi>Murder, That for a General or other Officers of an Army, in time of Peace to put any man, although a Souldier, to death, by colour of Martial Law, it is abſolute murder in that General, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore erecting of Martial Law now, when all Courts of Iuſtice are open, and ſtopping the free current of Law, which ſufficiently provides for the puniſhment of Souldiers as well as others, as appears by 18. <hi>H.</hi> 6. Chap. 19. and 2, &amp; 3. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. Chap. 2. 4, &amp; 5. <hi>P.</hi> &amp; <hi>M.</hi> Chap. 3. &amp; 5. <hi>El.</hi> 5. &amp; 5. <hi>Jam.</hi> 25. is an abſolute deſtroying of our Fundamental Liberties, and the razing of the Foundation of the Common Law of England; the which out of Duty and Conſcience to the Rights and Freedoms of this Nation (which we value above our lives) and to leave You and your Councel without all excuſe, we were moved to repreſent unto Your Excellency, Earneſtly preſſing, you well to conſider what you do, before you proceed to the taking away the Lives of thoſe men by Martial Law; leſt the bloud of the Innocent (and ſo palpable Subverſion of the Laws and Liberties of England) bring the reward of juſt vengeance after it upon you, as it did upon the Earl of Strafford: For innocent bloud God will not pardon; and what the people may do (in caſe of ſuch violent Subverſion of their Rights) we ſhall leave to Your Excellency to judge, and remain</p>
