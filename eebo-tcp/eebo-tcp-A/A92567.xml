         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>MY Lord Chancellor, Before I ſpeak any thing,
I ſhall Humble Proteſt my words may not

to be Believed; and I ſhall (with Gods aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance)
ſpeak Truth from a Heart. I ſhall (my Lord)

                  <hi>Yea let him take all, ſince my Lord the King is come

God Almighty, Gratiouſly to Return his SACRED
MAJESTY, to the Royal Excerciſe of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over theſe Nations (to which he hath indoubted
Right) and moſt Unjuſtly, and Violently, thruſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
by the late Tyrannizing Uſurpers.</p>
               <p>It is (my Lord) exceeding matter of Joy to us all,
that, that Iron Yoak of Uſurpation (under which we
have theſe many years, ſadly Groaned) is now broke:
and with ſuch Freedome, this High, and Honourable
Court of Parliament are meeting together, under the
Refreſhing Warm Beams of his MAJESTIES ROYAL
GOVERNMENT, ſo much longed for, by our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſtarved Expectations; and I do earneſtly wiſh his
ROYAL Preſence upon his Throne amongſt us; but
ſince at this time, that great happineſs cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
expected; I am glad, that his Majeſties Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
hath ſingled out ſuch a Qualified, and Worthy
Perſon as my Lord Commiſſioners Grace, to Repreſent
himſelf: whoſe Unſpotted Loyalty to his Majeſty, we
can all Witneſſe.</p>
               <p>I cannot (my Lords) but acknowledge, that there are
two Grand Mercies, which comfortably attend my
preſent condition. One is the High Thoughts I deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
Entertain, of that Tranſcendent, and Princely
Clemency, wherewith his SACRED MAJESTIE is ſo
admirably Delighted, abundantly Evindenced by many
Noted and Singular Teſtimonies, in all the Steps of
his Majeſties Carriage; as thoſe moſt Gratious Letters,
Declarations, and that Free, and moſt Ample Act of
Indempnitie, &amp;c. Granted to all his Majeſties Subjects,
to Eradicate any Time<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous Jealouſie of his Majeſties
Gratious Pardon; which might happily ariſe, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Reflectings, convincing them Forcibly of their
own Miſcarriages, in theſe moſt unhapy times of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:115624:3"/>
The Effects (my Lords) of which Princely Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I am confidently hopeful, his Majeſtie hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Experimentally, and ſhall futurely find, prove
an effectual cement, to conciliate the moſt Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchich,
and Diſaffected Perſons (excepting
ſome) thoſe Barbarous Phanaticks) in all his Majeſties
Dominions) moſt willingly to the Subjection of his
MAJESTIES ROYAL SCEPTER; and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Hatred<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 139. 22.</note> Abominate all Diſloyal Practiſes in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or others in all times coming.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, my Lords, when I conſider, that my
Judges are not ſuch as we had of late (ſtrangers) but
my own Country men; both which joyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Royal Sence, and Solid Convictions
I had of my Innocency, of theſe Calumnies moſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
charged upon me) Encourages my hopes rather,
to expect ſuch dealing, as will moſt Sympathize with
that Clement Humour, (to which his SACRED MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTY
hath ſuch a Natural Propenſitie) and ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Adminiſtrate Juſtice, (void of all byaſſing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices)
as will be moſt ſutable for ſuch a High, and
Honourable Meeting.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore (my Lord) deſire to uſe <hi>Pauls</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for himſelf, being accuſed of his Countrymen,
(I deſire not to be miſtaken) having a learned Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
(<hi>Tertullius</hi>) accuſing him, as I have my Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate:
<hi>Pauls</hi> was Hereſie, mine of another nature;
but I muſt ſay with him,<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 24. 14, 15, 16.</note> That the things they all
laid againſt me, cannot be proved. But this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
in the way allowed, by Solemn Oaths, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
I have ſerved God, my King, and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
(as he ſaid) which they themſelves allow.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſhall (my Lord) Remember (not with
Repining, but for Information) my hard uſage, never
having had any hearing, nor allowance of Pen, Ink,
or Paper, until I received this Summons; which was
(in Effect) a load, above a burden; Enemies (both
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115624:4"/>
                  <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi>) out of malice, Calumniating me for
all the ſame things, excepting what relates to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
moſt Royall Father of ever Glorious Memory.</p>
               <p>Therefore, (My Lord,) I beg Charity and Patient
hearing, not doubting, but the Wiſdom and Goodneſs
of the Parliament will be ſo favourable, and not as the
inconſiderate multitude (as a learned able man writes)
ſayes he<note n="a" place="margin">Sir <hi>Walt. Rauleighs</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Hiſt. of the World.</note> As we ſee in experience, that Dogs they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bark at thoſe they know not: And that it is their
nature to accompany one another in thoſe Clamours;
So it is with the inconſiderate multitude, who wanting
that vertue which we call Honeſty in all men, and that
ſpeciall gift of God, which we call Charity in Chriſtian
Men; Condemn without Hearing, and wound without
Offence given; led thereunto by uncertain report only,
which his <hi>Majeſty King James</hi> only acknowledgeth to
be the Father of Lies. I ſhall not deſire to be in the leaſt
miſtaken by any that hear me: But ſure I am, it is
pertinently applicable to my Caſe.</p>
               <p>I intreat likewiſe your Lordſhips ſeriouſly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the words of another Notable Man,<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Speed</hi> in his Hiſtory.</note> who ſayes (<hi>d</hi>)
As the Tongues of <hi>Paraſites</hi> are ill Ballances to weigh the
vertues of Princes, &amp; great Men; ſo neither ought theirs
nor other Mens Blemiſhes be looked upon, as they are
drawn with the deformed Pencill of Envy, or Canker,
which do alwayes attend Eminency, whether in Place
or Virtue. I ſhall not (My Lord) be ſo preſumptuous,
as to Arrogate any thing to my ſelf in this, only I want
not the two Companions; for I am but a weak Man,
Subject to many Failings and Infirmities, whereof I do
not purge my ſelf; for as we muſt all confeſſe to God
Almighty,<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 130. v. 3.</note> if he ſhould mark Iniquities, who can
ſtand? Neither ſhall I ſay, that there cannot an hole
be diſcovered (as the Proverb is) in my Coat: and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be ſo with any, ſpecially ſuch as have laboured
in ſuch times and buſineſſes; but <hi>I</hi> bleſſe the Lord, that
in theſe things which hath been, and are here caſt upon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115624:4"/>
me, <hi>I</hi> am able to make the falſhood, and miſconſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them palpably appear.</p>
               <p>My Lord, (before I mention any thing in particular)
I muſt ſhew this Honourable Meeting of Parliament, &amp;
all that hear me (who doubtleſs have various Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of my being preſent in this condition,) that I am
here rather upon the account of Misfortune than Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
wherein I deſire to explain the differences, as <hi>Plato</hi> and
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> do very well, Calling Injuries, ſuch things as are
done purpoſely, and with a wicked mind; And misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
ſuch things as are done with a good mind, though
the events prove bad; yet, we could not foreſee them.</p>
               <p>So (My Lord,) I ſhall take God to Record (who
muſt judge me one day,) upon my Conſcience, that
what I did, flowed not from any Injurious Pinciples to
any, though I acknowledge, the events were not ſtill
ſucceſſefull, which was my misfortune indeed: But it
has been my lot often, in theſe times, (wherein I, and
many others, were inevitably involved by the malicious
tongues of my Calumniating Enemies, to be miſconſtrued
for the worſt; yea, even in many which the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to make ſucceſſefull: For the truth of this, I may (I
hope) ſafely appeal to many in this Honourable Houſe,
who can abundantly witneſſe my Faithfull, and Loyall
Endeavours for both My King, and Native Country,
whereof I ſhould be very ſparing to be a Herald my
ſelf, were not the contrary ſo impudently affirmed.</p>
               <p>There are five main Calumnies, that I deſire (My Lord) to
ſatisfie all that hear me a little in, to the end, that the reſt
of leſs moment, may be likewiſe (in its own due time) heard
afterward, abſtracting more from perſonal prejudice.</p>
               <p>The firſt Calumny is, My Lord, concerning that
Horrid and Unparaleld Murder of his late ROYAL
MAJESTY, of Eternall bleſſed Memory: I do here
publickly declare, That I neither deſire, nor deſerve
the leaſt Countenance, or Favour, if I was either acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to it, or on the Councell, or Knowledge of it:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115624:5"/>
which to make clearly appear, is under Oath in the
Parliament Books 1649. (whereof I was the firſt Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
my ſelf) to the intent, we might both Vindicate our
ſelves, and Endeavour a Diſcovery, if any amongſt us
had any acceſſion to that Horrid and Villanous Crime;
As alſo in my latter Will, which I made; going to
<hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1655. or 1656. fearing what poſſibly
might hereafter be obtruded by any upon me or my
family upon that account, I ſet it down, to clear me to
poſterity, that I was altogether free of that deteſtable
and execrable Crime, or of any prejudice at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
in either Perſon or Government. I left this with
a very worthy Gentleman, (I believe) well known to
your Lordſhips all, and never ſaw it ſince; So your
Lordſhips may be pleaſed (if ye will) to call for it, and
try the truth; Whatſoever other thing may be in it, I
hope (My Lord) this Opportunity is a mercy to me, to
have that Vile Calumny (among many others) againſt
me to be cleared.</p>
               <p>And (My Lord) to make this particular yet more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
I did ſtill, and do poſitively aſſert, That I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſaw that monſtruous Uſurper, <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> in
the face, nor never had the leaſt Correſpondence with
him, or any of that Sectarian Army, untill the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Committee of Eſtates ſent me with ſome
other Noble Men, and Gentlemen, to the Borders, in
<hi>Anno,</hi> 1648. to ſtop his march into <hi>Scotland,</hi> after thoſe
who returned from <hi>Preston</hi> fight.</p>
               <p>Neither, after he left the Borders in the Year 1648.
did I ever Correſpond with him, or any of that Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Army; So unſatisfied was <hi>I</hi> with their way, after
the wicked and ſiniſtrous courſes he and they were
upon, afforded evident Preſumptions for us to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
That he, and they, intended prejudice to
his Royall Majeſty: onely one Letter <hi>I</hi> received from
Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig;</hi> to which <hi>I</hi> returned Anſwer, <hi>That
he might have ſpared his pains in writing to me: For I bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115624:5"/>
the Lord, who had taught me, by his Word, To Fear God,
and Honour the King, and not to meddle with them that
were gi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>en to Change.</hi> Though Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> be now dead,
yet he acknowledged to ſeverall in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that my
Letter he ſtill had: and when <hi>I</hi> was there, <hi>I</hi> often deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
he might be poſed, and examined upon it; which <hi>I</hi>
can preſently inſtruct.</p>
               <p>And during (my Lord) my being in <hi>England,</hi> neither
at <hi>London,</hi> nor <hi>Newcastle,</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1647. there was not
any thing ſo much as mentioned, concerning his late
Majeſties perſon: All that ever <hi>I</hi> heard of it, was in
publick Parliament 1647. The Commiſſioners papers
at <hi>London,</hi> and Committee-Books at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> will
clear this fully.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Calumny is, Anent the inhumane mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Duke <hi>James Hamilton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, its well known, my great reſpect to that
truly Noble, and Worthy perſon; whereof (upon all
occaſions) <hi>I</hi> gave ample teſtimonies, and can yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
any of his Friends with the Reality of it; and
evidenced my true Sorrow, for the wicked cruelty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
on him. But indeed, <hi>I</hi> cannot deny, <hi>I</hi> refuſed
to Complement <hi>Cromwell</hi> on his behalf; he having (my
Lord) been immediately Proceeding ſo Inſtrumental,
and ſo very Active in that moſt Horrid, and Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Murder of his late SACRED MAJESTY. And
if I had done otherwayes, undoubtedly, it had been
a more Black Article in that Lybil now Read, then any
that's in it.</p>
               <p>The third Calumny is, that which breeds a great
part of theſe groundleſs Clamours, (though it be not
in the Inditement) i<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> my Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Huntly</hi> his
death, wherein (I may truly ſay) I was earneſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
him, as poſſible I could, which is very well
known to many in this Honourable Houſe. And my
not prevailing, may ſufficiently evidence, I had not ſo
great a ſtroak, nor power in the Parliament, as is Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115624:6"/>
And my Lord, for his Eſtate, I had nothing in that,
but for my own abſolute neceſſary Releif: and was even
moſt willing to part with any Intereſt I had therein;
getting his friends (who profeſſed Zeal, for the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Familie) engaged for warrandiſe to me,
for any proportion that ſhould happen to fall for my
ſatisfaction. And to Evidence that I was no means to
harm the Familie, I ſtood with my Right, betwixt all
Fines, and Forfeitures of lands, and accompted for
any thing I did receive: and to manifeſt yet further,
that the burden of that Family, was not from any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick
cauſe to themſelves; <hi>I</hi> have under the old Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes
own hand, and his Son <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Gordoun,</hi>
(who was a very worthy young Nobleman) the juſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory
of their debts, amounting to about one Million
of <hi>Mark Scots,</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. It would <hi>I</hi> fear, (my
Lord, conſume too much of the Parliaments pretious
time) to hear many other circumſtances to make this
particular more clear: which <hi>I</hi> ſhall at this time forbear.</p>
               <p>The fourth Calumny is, The Death of the Marqueſs
of <hi>Montroſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many in this Houſe (my Lord) who know
very well, <hi>I</hi> refuſed to meddle either in the matter, or
manner of it; and ſo far were we from having any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
quarrells at one another, that in <hi>Anno</hi> 1645. he
and I was fully agreed upon Articles, and Conditions,
contained in a Treaty paſt betwixt us; and it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his fault, nor mine, that buſineſs did not end at
that time; which (its known to all) proved very Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the Kingdom thereafter.</p>
               <p>The fifth Calumny is, concerning my dealing with
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> after <hi>Worceter</hi> fight: its well known (my
Lord) to many, that my ſelf, and the Gentlemen of
<hi>Argyle-ſhire</hi> (my Kinſmen, Vaſſalls, and Tennants)
Endeavoured Cordially, to engage all their Neighbours
about them, on all handſ againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which they
did not prevail in; but was moſt unhappily made known
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115624:6"/>
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commanders, for the time, (which they
cauſed immediately to publiſh (as a very notable diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
in their Newes Books) which occaſioned two ſad
Diſadvantages to us; for they not only cruſhed our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
in the infantry, but alſo determined the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Reſolutions againſt us; whereby two ſtrong Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Foot (<hi>Overtons</hi> and <hi>Reads</hi>) and very neer
the number of one of Horſe, (under the Command of
one <hi>Blackmore</hi>) were ſent to <hi>Argyle-ſhire,</hi> and when
Dean came there, it pleaſed God to viſit me with a
great diſtemper of ſickneſſe, as Dr. <hi>Cunningham,</hi> and
many others who were with me can witneſs.</p>
               <p>What (my Lord) I was preſſed unto, when I was
violently in their hands, may be inſtructed by the paper
it ſelf, written by <hi>Deanes</hi> mans own hand, yet extant
to ſhow, which <hi>I</hi> did abſolutely refuſe, upon all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of the uttermoſt of their malice; as alſo what <hi>I</hi>
was neceſſitated to do, is likewiſe ready to be ſhown,
whereby <hi>I</hi> was ſtill detained their Priſoner upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> ſhall (my Lord) add one Reaſon more to clear
this, beſides many other weighty publick Reaſons and
Conſiderations (which <hi>I</hi> ſhall forbear to mention at
this time, it being more naturall to bring them by way of
defences afterwards) my own intereſt, and of all Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and Superiours in <hi>Scotland;</hi> it may be rationally
preſumed, that <hi>I</hi> had been a very ſenſeleſs fool,
if ever <hi>I</hi> had been for promoting ſuch and ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
or intereſt over me, as levelled all, and was ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
deſtructive to all that differenced my ſelf, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Noble-men, from their own Vaſſals (which many
ſayes they were too earneſt in) yea, it being likewiſe ſo
abſurdly derogatory to all true Nobilitie, and my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
and <hi>I</hi> (as is ſaid in that Lybell) have had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
titles of Honour, Dignitie, and Eminent Places of
Truſt conferred upon us, by his Majeſties Royal Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
and Himſelf, all for our conſtant Loyalty and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115624:7"/>
to the Crown, at all Occaſions, (as the Records
and Hiſtories of this ancient Kingdom holds forth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the narrative of all our grants) and aſſerting the
juſt Priviledges thereof againſt Oppoſers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> did (my Lord) ever (even when the <hi>Engliſhs</hi> were
at the intollerable height of Uſurpation) declare my
abhorrence to a Common-wealth Government, which
was well known to them all. <hi>I</hi> was not indeed (my Lord
very diſſatified, when there were Rumors current, of
<hi>Cromwells being made a King (as ſome here can witneſs.</hi>)
for <hi>I</hi> told them, it was the moſt probable way for his
Majeſties advantage; therefore the leſs it were oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and the more it were encouraged, it would tend to
<hi>Cromwells,</hi> and their deformed Common-wealths Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
ruine; and promote his Majeſties juſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
the more.</p>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not much blame my Lord Advocate
for doing his Endeavour, (it being in Eſſentiall part
of his function to accuſe) but <hi>I</hi> muſt ſay, that its very
hard meaſure, that ſo able a man hath neer as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moneths, in taking paines to promp as many
Enemies as his perſwaſions could poſſibly invite, to
bend upon the higheſt notes of their malice, and
laying out ſearch by them for, and collecting all the
Bad Reports, or rather (to give them their genuine
term) <hi>I</hi> may call them a confuſed maſs of the Common
Claſſis of the Countrie; thereby to deviſe miſconſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of all the publick actings of both Parliaments or
Committees, during the late Troubles, and with
ſtrange and remote Inferences, and to adduce all thoſe
to the channell of my particular Actings, as many <hi>I</hi> ſay
(my Lord) moneths, as <hi>I</hi> have dayes to Anſwer them,
(being an exceeding diſadvantage.) But (my Lord)
thats not all, <hi>I</hi> am likewiſe extreamly gauled, that he
labours in that Libell all along, to draw an obſcure vail
of perpetuall Oblivion over all my Good Services, and
ſpecially my Faithfull, and Royall Endeavours, in Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115624:7"/>
his Sacred Majeſty to the Crown of his this moſt
Ancient Kingdom of Scotland, and the excerciſe of his
Majeſties Royall Authority therein; with my cordiall
Endeavours for his Majeſties Reſtitution to the reſt of
his Dominions alſo, which his Majeſty both knows, and
has been pleaſed often to acknowledge it to have been
Good Service: and yea, many preſent in this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Houſe knows, that <hi>I</hi> extended both my Zeal and
Affection to the uttermoſt of my power, for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Service in that particular: which <hi>I</hi> willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
nothing (my Lord) but my Duty, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>I</hi> was Tied, both by Natural, Civil, and Chriſtian
Bonds to my Soveraign; and eſpecially ſuch a Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
KING, of whom <hi>I</hi> may now (as <hi>I</hi> have often) Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
That he is a King, in whom the Lord has taken
ſuch pleaſure, as to poſſeſſe his Majeſty with ſo many
Superlative Degrees of Excellency, that any of his
Princely perfections may be a Characteriſtick Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſufficient to Exalt his Majeſties Fame, both in
our Age, and to the ſubſequent Poſterity, above all
the Monarchs in the World.</p>
               <p>So (My Lord) we may conſequently diſcover a high
Demonſtration of the Lords ſingular Kindneſs, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
providentiall Care for us his Majeſties Subjects,
in preſerving ſuch a Rich Bleſſing as his SACRED
MAJESTY; (in whom the happineſs of theſe Nations
is wrapped up) under the ſafe wings of his Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
I may ſay, even when the extravagant malice
of men would have ſwallowed him up.</p>
               <p>After his Lordſhip had ended this diſcourſe (being
heard very attentively by all without any interruption)
my Lords Advocate ſayes to my Lord Chancellor thus,
<hi>My Lord Chancellour, but what can the Marqueſs of</hi> Argyle
<hi>ſay to the oppoſition at Striveling in Anno,</hi> 1648? The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
replyed, that he found my Lord Advocate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to bring him to debate the particulars,
which he hoped ſhould be cleared at a more convenient
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115624:8"/>
time, and waved it, anſwering nothing to the thing it
ſelf, but inſiſted thus:</p>
               <p>(My Lord Chancellour) <hi>I</hi> have <hi>Informativè</hi> only hinted
at the main things, which I am often charged with, my
memory cannot fully reach all, neither will time permit
to Circumſtantiate theſe particulars, which I have onely
touched in the generall; nor is my purpoſe at preſent,
to fall on the debate of that Libell, not having, as yet
unfolded the proceſſe. By reaſon thoſe Advocates your
Lordſhips was pleaſed to allow me, have not yet all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
and the excuſes of my ordinary Advocates (in
whom <hi>I</hi> had confidence) being admitted as relievant:
And this Gentleman that hath been pleaſed (in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to your Lordſhips commands) to come here with
me, not being much acquainted with matters of this
weight, and not having embraced till within theſe two
or three dayes, ſo that they are ſtrangers altogether to
my caſe. <hi>I</hi> ſhall therefore (my Lord) humbly deſire,
that a competent time may be allowed me, that <hi>I</hi> may
prepare my defences, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall (God willing) abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
clear every particular in the Libell.</p>
               <p>And alſo (my Lord) <hi>I</hi> humbly deſire, that thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Advocates, who were ordained by your Lordſhips
to aſſiſt me; after the Honourable Lords of the Articles
rejected their excuſes, they may be now Ordained by
your Lordſhips, to conſult and appear for me.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſſe his Advocates entred a Protestation, that
what ſhould happen to eſcape them in pleading (either by
Word or Write) for the Life, Honour and Estate of the ſaid
Noble <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> their Client, might not thereafter be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
to them as Treaſonable; whereupon they took In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſſe aſſured my Lord Chancellour, that
he knew not of any ſuch proteſtation to be preſented,
and that it flowed ſimply of themſelves, and not of him.
Whereupon my Lord Chancellour deſired the Marqueſs
and his Advocates, to remove till the Houſe ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115624:8"/>
of both; my Lord Marqueſſes deſire, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates
Proteſtation.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſſe and his Advocates being removed,
The Houſe (after ſome ſmall debates) Reſolved, as to
my Lord Marqueſſes deſire, his Lordſhip ſhould have till
the 26 of <hi>March</hi> to give in his Defenſes in Write, and
ordained <hi>Mr. Andrew Ker</hi> to be one of his Advocates.</p>
               <p>As to the Advocates Proteſtation, The Houſe Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
That they could not be allowed to ſpeak any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
either by Word or Write, but upon their perill:
only allowed them, in the generall, as much as ever in
ſuch caſes was indulged to any.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs and his Advocates being called in, my
Lord Chancellour intimates the foreſaid Reſolutions of
the Houſe, both in reference to my Lord Marqueſſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and to the Advocates, in relation to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation.</p>
               <p>When my Lord Chancellour had done, the Marqueſſe
ſpake as followeth:</p>
               <p>My Lord Chancellour, There is one thing that had
almoſt eſcaped me, anent that Oppoſition at <hi>Striveling</hi>
1648. that my Lord Advocate was ſpeaking of, that it
may not ſtick with any of this Honourable Meeting, <hi>I</hi>
ſhall ingenuouſly declare, that after the Defeat at
<hi>Preston, I</hi> was deſired to come, and meet with the
Committee of Eſtates (meaning thoſe who were not in
the then Engagement) <hi>I</hi> came with ſome of my Friends
to <hi>Striveling,</hi> fearing no harm, nor ſuſpecting nothing;
<hi>I</hi> was invaded by Sir <hi>George Monro,</hi> where ſeveral of my
Friends were killed, and my ſelf hardly Eſcaped; which
is all that can be ſaid <hi>I</hi> acted in Armes, which many
here knowes to be moſt true.</p>
               <p>My Lord, not that <hi>I</hi> am any wayes Diffident, but <hi>I</hi>
ſhall in due time clear every particular in that Libell:
yet <hi>I</hi> am not a little troubled, That ſome, who have
heard the Calumnies therein, may let them have ſuch
an Impreſſion (being aſſerted with ſuch confidence) as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115624:9"/>
to conceive a poſſibility, if not a probability of their
being true. <hi>I</hi> ſhall therefore humbly deſire ſo much
Charity from this Honourable Meeting, that there may
be no hard thoughts entertained by any, till <hi>I</hi> be fully
heard.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſſe thereafter, with joint Concurrence
of his Advocates, humbly deſired, That his Bill, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
many pungent Reaſons for a precognition of
his Buſineſs, given in to the Honourable Lords of the
Articles, may be conſidered in plain Parliament.</p>
               <p>To which my Lord Chancellour Replyed, That it
had been formerly refuſed at the Articles, and that it
would not be granted.</p>
