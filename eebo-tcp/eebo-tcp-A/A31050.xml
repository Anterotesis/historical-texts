            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IF Monks are ſuch as they would
ſeem to be, they would make of
this Book a Meritorious Subject:
For in caſe what it contains be
untrue (as they will not fail to
ſay) they ought to rejoyce, by having
occaſion to ſuffer the being ill-ſpoken of
and calumniated, and to exerciſe that
Patience which they Preach unto us with
ſo fair a zeal: But in caſe it contains
truth (as indeed it doth) they will
receive this ſmall mortification with the
ſame Humility and Reſignation which
they have ſo often in their mouths: But
as they are nothing leſs than what they
ſeem to be; they will alſo act quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what ought to be expected from
them. At the very moment then of this
Dialogues appearing, you will ſee them
<pb facs="tcp:30280:4"/>
running up and down on all ſides, to
learn who is its Author; They will ſay,
that this Book is full of Falſities, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures,
Impieties, and Inſolences; that
the Author is an Atheiſt, a Libertine, a
wicked man, a Heretick, an Excomuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
perſon. This being their manner of
ſpeech, What is to be done in this caſe?
As for my part, I declare, and take God
to witneſs, that I am a <hi>Roman Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;</hi>
that I honour with a deep reſpect
the Religious Orders, if there be any that
have maintained themſelves according to
the holineſs of their Inſtitution, and of
their Rule, which I wiſh with all my ſoul,
to ſee them in the way which the Holy
Patriarchs have traced out to them;
whereof they have kept the Habit and
the Name: And it is with great trouble,
that I ſee the miſrule and diſorders which
are ſlipped in amongſt them; which I do
not write for any hatred, but to make
appear to them, their Artifices are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
that they now abuſe Fools and ſilly
Women, and that by the grace of God,
there are found out perſons, who know
Wolves under Sheeps-cloathing. Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb facs="tcp:30280:4"/>
ſome ſcrupulous perſon or other,
will find fault, that I cauſe to let ſlip
from this ſecularized Monk ſome words
a little free; but beſides, that it happens
not often from a man coming out of a
Cloyſter. The Reader may take notice if
he pleaſe, that I imitate the <hi>Limner,</hi>
who drawing a Picture, aims naturally
to repreſent; and who would offend the
Rules of his Art, and of true reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
if he cauſed us to behold a Hector
in a ſerious countenance. I queſtion not
the Monks finding many faults in this
little Book; neither am I ſo vain to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the ſame exempt from any: Nay, I
allow that therein they may juſtly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
an infinite number; yet let them rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
for defaults, the omiſſion of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
of Stories and Intrigues, which they
know are wanting in it.</p>

that they had loſt very much of
that purity and fervour which did at

the one of the other, and very
much byaſſed; that they did ſometimes
give occaſion of ſcandal, and that they

who are taken with exterior things and

led by their ſenſes; lovers of State-Novelties,
Solemnities, Beautifyings,
Adornings of Gilt-things, Pictures,
Harmony, who as Geeſe follow one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30280:10"/>

               <p>You ſay right; theſe ſeducers

garniſhed and ſet out with Images;
where Vows are rendred to Thighs,

               <p>Did you never take notice that
on ſolemn days, which are very frequent
with them, when there are Indulgences,
Sermons, Muſick, Expoſing and Bleſſing
the holy Sacrament; that there is alſo
at the Entrance of their Churches a
great Baſon on the Table, covered with
a Carpet, in which Baſon People put
Money.</p>

               <p>And it is for the cauſing of this
Baſon to ring that the Bells are rung; it
is this Baſon that cauſes the writing to
be ſtuck up at the door for Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
it is for this Baſon ſake that the
Altars are adorned, that there is Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
that the holy Sacrament is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
and the Bleſſing is given; it is
at the ſound of this Baſon, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of thoſe Brothers is a great
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30280:11"/>
deal better known than by that of the
Bells; it is to make them Maſters of the
Peoples Money, that they ſet out their
Altars; it is to ſuborn weak ſpirits, that
they adorn their Churches; it is to bring
gain to themſelves that they invite the
People to get Indulgences; in ſuch
wiſe that though their pretenſion is
the honour and glory of God, ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
is the true motive. They would

               <p>Is it the Trade of Religious men

have Indulgences almoſt for all the days

ſuffer their writings to remain always
poſted at their Churches door, like a
Signe, or a Tavern-Buſh. Read their
Books of Brotherhood, you will ſee for
Sunday 18000 years Indulgence, and as
many <hi>Quarantaines;</hi> for Munday full
Indulgence, Tueſday 10000 years In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
Wedneſday the ſame as well
as Thurſday and Friday; for Saturday
full Indulgence, Sunday 48000 years,
Munday 10000, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I believe theſe
Indulgences are nothing but the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Tables ſurrounded with leaves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

nothing elſe but miracles of Wax, and
are laden only with the workmanſhip

               <p>I know not what to ſay thereof,
you ought to know it better than I: if
that be true they are great abuſes.
But you ſay nothing of the Sermons
they preach at home and elſewhere;
you cannot diſallow that the Religious
Fellowſhips are the Nurſeries of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
who diſperſe themſelves through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30280:12"/>

drawn out, to be ſent into the Lords
Harveſt; that they are the Trumpets

which raiſe theſe Preachings, to make

thoſe two motives make up the ſtairs,
and ſteps which conduct them to the

ſtirs to no other end than to be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of the ſtirring of their Jaws; in

            <sp>

               <p>For I would have you know, that
as there is nothing which ſo much rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the Religious Fraternities, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
Religious perſons, as doth the
imployment of Preaching; ſo they
ſtudy and apply themſelves for the moſt
part thereto, but in ſuch a manner as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30280:13"/>
in no wiſe to be profitable in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as they never do. For even as they
are formed to live in Love, in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
and with Confidence, which are
the three Characters of a Monkiſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
ſo are they inſtructed to Preach as
they live, that is to ſay, to make plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Diſcourſes, and to accompany
them with wry faces, and to ſpread
themſelves forth with impudence. Who
would not laugh to ſee theſe Apes
come into the Pulpit with a Stoical
Countenance and Gravity; who after
their having fiercely beheld their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
they pull and draw themſelves
up together, biting their lips? after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
methodically put down their
Hoods, they raiſe up their eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with an Hypocritical Countenance?
who after their having made a great
ſign of the Croſs, they hold forth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
with a premeditated Tone, which
I can hardly call Gods word. But who
would not be in wrath to behold their
ſeveral changes and diſguiſes, when by
their prating they choak that holy
Word? who would not murmer to ſee
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30280:13"/>
how they cauſe that daughter of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to appear, that Meſſengereſs of God
in the Pulpit, as if ſhe were upon a
Theater, a Curteſan and Strumpet, or
like unto a Comedianeſs, who would
not tremble through ſpite to ſee them
mask up that holy <hi>Minerva,</hi> come forth
of the brains of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> What do I ſay
mask her? for they curle her up, and
paint her like unto a wanton <hi>Venus.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>You mount the great horſe, and
are going to preach, unleſs you look
to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot contain, when I think
upon thoſe abuſes. Is it not a ridiculous
thing to behold a begging Monk who
ought to preach the Fundamental Truths
of our Religion &amp; Salvation, Curling his
Corde, in accent and geſture aiming at
a <hi>Pariſian</hi> air, acting the art of begging,
and playing the Hypocrite all at once?
But that which makes me yet the more
inveterate, is, that their affected im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence
meets with approbation from
the people, and that the word of God
cannot be taſted unleſs it be perfumed
&amp; adorned with all the flowers of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30280:14"/>
and the Academical Graces.
What fruit think you then can
proceed from perſons who aim at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to pleaſe!—Who care not for
gaining Souls, but Ears; who in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
endeavour not to perſwade peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
any thing, ſave that they preach
well! If they are labourers as you have
alledged, are they not labourers in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity?
If they are Trees drawn out
of the Nurſeries of Cloyſters, are not
they ſuch, which bring forth naughty
fruit, and which our Saviour condemns
to be rooted up? If they are Trumpets
(ſeeing you call them ſo) are they not
of that naughty braſs to which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
compares himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1. and to
which may juſtly be compared all ſuch
whoſe Sermons are void of charity, yea
even although in Eloquence they went
beyond the very Angels?</p>

               <p>Well, let that paſs; but what have
you to ſay concerning their Veſpers, the

               <p>God forbid, but when I ſee the
holy Sacrament expoſed at the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30280:14"/>
of their Tabernacles, I ſhould think
that God is there, as heretofore he was

            <sp>

               <p>That is a good thought.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I mean, that he is there between

we would have ſome body to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſomething, it is the laſt thing you
charge him withal, and that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to him; ſo alſo theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Fathers, as they bleſs and take
leave of the people, make to them the
ſign of the Croſs, by that ſign ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
to them not to forget them at

               <p>Why do you imagine, that their
Bells tingle ſo much, and ſo often? it is
only to allure the devout femal ſex,
under the pious pretence of Veſpers,
which being ended, you may behold
ſome of theſe <hi>Rommagrobis</hi> of Monks
coming forth, who greedily accoſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and after a ſmall chat lead them in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30280:15"/>
dark Chappels. It is there where there
are bad actions and prating, and praying
by feeling as well as after Veſpers.</p>

               <p>I beg your pardon for this Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
tending a little to Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme;
ſometimes ſome Cloyſter-ſaying
ſlips from me, I did believe my ſelf ſtill
a Monk. But let us ſpeak freely, and
without equivocation; their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are now like unto that Temple of
<hi>Athens,</hi> which was dedicated to Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or otherwiſe like that of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
which was conſecrated to <hi>Venus.</hi> It is
in theſe Churches where all ſhame is
loſt; it is there where there is publick
wooing; it is there where more Incenſe
is given to Ladies than to Divinity it
ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>What, is this profanation ſeen in

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I own that whereſoever men pray
<hi>Pel-mel</hi> with Women there is pratling.
But it is evident that there is leſs elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30280:15"/>

               <p>What would you have? they are

In caſe they would rectifie this abuſe,
they would render their Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts;

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>In truth this Toleration in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

               <p>
                  <hi>Hugenots</hi> are modeſt in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
You ſee no <hi>Libertiniſme</hi> in the
<hi>Turks</hi> Moſques; Women are ſeparated
from the Men, and ſit in ſo cloſe a place
that no body can ſee them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I was ſome days ſince a-reading,
that the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who are Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,

               <p>Quite contrary do our Chriſtians,

Women.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>That is nothing; what would

               <p>I am amazed to ſee you ſurpriſed

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Is it a thing to be admired at?
nay hold it for a certain truth, that
when a Woman hath once abandoned

               <p>Ha, ha, elſewhere. They are Dogs,
Goats, Monſters of Adultery, and go
beyond whatever <hi>Petronius, Bocacius,</hi>
or <hi>Aretine,</hi> have deſcribed. Where do
you imagin they go for the moſt part,
when you behold them going with ſo

It was a crime puniſhable by

this impudent fellow confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

any ſuch uſe of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Viſion, wherein

not likely that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw <hi>Jacobins, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites,</hi>
Fryers of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Order

               <p>There was a good Fellow, who
was in love with a very handſome
young Widow, who daily came to Maſs
in his Church, which was not far from
her habitation; and he being a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi>
upon his firſt beholding her, fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not, with a ſmiling countenance, and
his head half out of his Hood to go to
her, and to acquaint her that Maſs
would ſoon begin, and that for her
ſake he would forward it. Theſe ſmall
kindneſſes were a means that at his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
through the Church, procured him
now and then ſome favourable looks,
which proceeded in that fair one, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from civility, than from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
ſhe had for that Bald-pate.
But he took it in another ſence: and
this Lady falling ſick, and having for
three or four days been abſent from
Maſs, this good Father miſſing her
makes an inquiry, and having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the reaſon, fails not to give her
a viſit, and to aſſure her how much he
was concerned for her Indiſpoſition,
and to profer her ſuch ſmall ſervices as
he was capable of; withal acquainting
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30280:19"/>
her, that if ſhe pleaſed, he would bring
her ſome Relicks from their Church,
and ſome of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s ſmall loaves,
by which ſeveral people had received
eaſe.</p>

(ſays ſhe) pray what rare Relicks
have you? We have, ſays he, the <hi>holy Thorn,</hi>
one of St. <hi>Margarets</hi> Bones, one of

So many, ſays the Monk, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſeveral thouſands of poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               <p>Be patient; it makes barren Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
fruitful, and preſerves the fruit of
the womb after conception, and eaſes
their pains in Child-birth. It maintains in
health whoſoever eats of it, it keeps from
ill luck thoſe who carry it about them;
it brings away from the tender throats
of young Children the bones of fiſh,
bits of glaſs, needles, nails and the like,
which they may have ſwallowed una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.
It cures all Fevers, nay evil and
peſtilent, alſo Epidemical ones, and the
moſt incurable diſeaſes; preſerves from
all poyſons, delivers whole Cities, nay
Provinces from the Plague. In ſhort, it
operates many other Miracles of the
like nature. Father (ſays the good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
how much ſhall I be obliged to
you, if you will be ſo kind as to bring
me a little of that bleſſed bread, and of

made in commendation of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,

them to her to kiſs, he pull'd the

to preſerve the out-ſide, that is to ſay,
to maintain themſelves in eſteem and

whoſe Revenue is partly aſſigned upon

when ſome ſcandalous fault is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the ſame is puniſhed, becauſe that
ſcandal has that of evil with it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Monks, that if peoples charity
be cooled their Kitchin grows cold, and
'tis a ſtumbling block which breaks the

               <p>Yea truly, I know one, who
was very well indu'd with that of
Preaching, and is a very handſom man,
but otherwiſe mighty debauched, who
having got a Nun with Child at <hi>Tulin</hi>
in <hi>Dolphine,</hi> was ſtreight-ways ſent to
<hi>Dole,</hi> where he did Preach with ſo

               <p>This is the advantage which

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30280:22"/>
elſewhere, where they are not

they begin new pranks. 'Tis not ſo
with an Eccleſiaſtical perſon, who is
tyed to his Benefice; and if he be
tardy, his Crime appears upon his
door; (that I may uſe the words
in <hi>Geneſis</hi>). He muſt for the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>Such as you talk of are very

I am weary of tumbling and living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

I did propoſe to my ſelf ſweetneſs

Alas, how much are you deceived!
bethink your ſelf, how miſerable a
thing it is to be confined to a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
to live amongſt Peaſants, who
are like unto ſo many wild beaſts,
to paſs your days without converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

               <p>Nothing is ſo much againſt my

               <p>Is it not an unjuſt thing to ſee

to ſee the Tythes raked from Pariſhes,

to ſee thoſe very men that
do ſervice, ſhare their dues with
others, from whom they ſhould rather

receive them. Is it not a ſhameful
thing, that in Churches, which yield
them three and 4000 Livres re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
they will not ſo much as find
a Cloth to cover the Altar, nothing
appearing there but Cobwebs and

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, they are the Patrons,

               <p>Yea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to return to our

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>You are in the right: for in caſe
a Parſon in a Benefice be ſick, ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
there is running to the Doctor,
to inquire of his health; and if he
be in danger, there is ſpurring, flying,
bribery, ſoliciting, intreaties, begging

nay there is beſetting, aſſaſſinating,

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis the zeal of the Lords Houſe
devours thoſe runners after Benefices;

               <p>I retain a little tang of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
whence I came, I ſtill think to
have my head in a hood; you muſt
pardon me, by degrees I ſhall correct
my ſelf. But let us proceed, if you
pleaſe; I ſay that this abuſe in the
Church is of bad conſequence, for it
binds the hands of Biſhops, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well refuſe a Benefice to him that
is nominated, provided he be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
endowed with knowledg, and
have no ill report; as if it did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
ſuffice for Beneficed Curates,
to be without ſcandal, whereas over

the Conduct and Government of

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>There are ſome Dioceſſes, as that
of <hi>Sens,</hi> where there is but little care
of ſuch Nominations, nay not ſo much
as what <hi>Rome</hi> provides. A Prieſt
ſhould wait for his juſtification, by
his ſufficiency and his virtue, whereof
he ought to have given proofs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>This ought to be done every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where:
in Truth Mr. <hi>De Sans</hi> was a

reforming his Dioceſs, and did

I have always had a particular vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for him, ſince he took thoſe
poor <hi>Nuns of St. Clare</hi> of <hi>Provence,</hi>
out of the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> Claws, who were
their directors.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I have wondered a hundred

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Jacobins</hi> have done no leſs

Conduct: when I was a Schollar in a
City of <hi>Languedock,</hi> I often went to
viſit one of my kinſwomen.</p>
               <p>She was a Nun in a Monaſtery of
St. <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Sienna,</hi> whoſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
was a <hi>Jacobin,</hi> a man of years,
and of a good countenance; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
a great prater and babler,
whom I did often ſerve at <hi>Maſs.</hi> This
Father, being in the Veſtry, after he
had undreſt, did tell the Maids a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ſtories. I heard him once tell a
young one, that he had the laſt night
dreamed of her, and that in that
dream he had ejaculatory Prayers,
with great ſighs and tenderneſs of
heart. Another time, entertaining
himſelf with two of thoſe Maids, he
told them what a devotion he had for
Breſts, and that to enter into Paradiſe,
he was in the mind that one muſt
firſt be in favour with Breſts; that it
was to renew the Martyrdom and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
of the Primitive-Church, to
keep thoſe innocent Breſts impriſoned,
and to hinder them from ſeeing day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
that they would anſwer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

God Almighty, for uſing ſo much

               <p>That had been but a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
only to prate of them, had he not
acted alſo. One day I perceived, that
putting his hand through the Bar, he
put it in a fair Nuns breſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>He did viſit the Breſts, which were
Priſoners, and had a mind to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Paradiſe. Yet this comes not near
thoſe abominable filthineſſes, into
which thoſe Devils of <hi>Cordeliers</hi> had
plunged that Monaſtery of <hi>Provence.</hi>
I wiſh that <hi>Factum</hi> were re-printed,
and that it were ſpread about every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
to the end that thoſe Goats
might not dare any more to appear,
but be forc'd to flee to ſome ſolitary
place, like unto theſe Scape-goats, laden
with the ſins of the people, whereof
mention is made in <hi>Leviticus.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Do you believe that that would
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30280:26"/>
avail in any thing? The Hood is an
Head-piece, and their Frock a Coat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
of good proof againſt all that.
What have theſe great men gained,
<hi>William of St. Amour, Agrippa, Buchanan,
Eraſmus, Canus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Belley,</hi> and
ſo many other, who have laid open the

               <p>The provoking of thoſe waſps is

The Pope muſt certainly excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,

<hi>Alexander</hi> the fourth was forced to
give, one upon the neck of the other,
Forty Bulls in their favour, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
of this Book; which though
it was burnt by reaſon of their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſuit, was notwithſtanding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(pray take notice of this) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
and declared innocent by
the voice of the whole Conſiſtory.
Yet after all this, theſe Furies did ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir

Bull, by which the Author of it

who work miracles amongſt the

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Yet they ought to have cauſed

            <sp>

               <p>By that I mean, that there are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30280:28"/>
certain Fryars, who would perſwade
us, that ſuch a one is a Gentleman, that
formerly he bore Arms, that he hath had
Command in the Army. This is done
to the end that fools being prepoſſeſt
with this opinion, and admiring this
example of Converſion and Submiſſion,
may more largely beſtow their Alms;
for, ſay they, here's what may well
teach us to mortifie our ſelves: Do
you behold that Brother who begs
and carries the bag, demanding Alms?
He is a Gentleman: then the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
bids the Wife fetch up a pint of
the beſt in the Cellar, and empty it
into the brothers Bottle, who will
pray for them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, but thoſe mumpers—who
know all things, and are everywhere,
would have ſuppreſſed it before it
had come to light; and when they
can do no better, they buy, or cauſe
to be bought up by their Friends, all
the Copies of a Book, and gather them
to themſelves, as the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30280:28"/>
done of the <hi>Factum of the Nuns of

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>The meaning then is, that they

            <sp>

               <p>I would do thus: as ſoon as it
ſhould be known that a Monk had
played ſome prank, it ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
be poſted up in ſome of the
moſt frequented places. By this means
the people going and coming, who
ſhould ſee it, would ſpread the ſame
quite through the City. Then for
example's ſake, I would put in my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be poſted up: <q>Such a day, ſuch
a father, of ſuch an order, was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in a bawdy-houſe with a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſan
by three good companions, who
having ſeized him, threatned that they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30280:29"/>
would call the Captain of that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which obliged this good religious
perſon, that he might free himſelf out
of their hands, to preſent them with
his <hi>Advent</hi> and <hi>Lent</hi>-Money, with all
he had begged, and all had been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
for him at the Church-doors;
as alſo to pay the Collation, which
they had ſent for to treat the Monk—
Such a Father the feſtival day of their
bleſſed Patriarch, having confeſſed, or
ſeeming to have confeſſed a Curteſan
(known to be ſuch a one) at his
going from thence, returned to the
Convent; and the wench being gone
to wait for him at the gate, this
good Father was ſeen to cauſe her to
enter the Porters Lodg, who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
was privy to the deſign, where ſhe
remained at leaſt five or ſix hours,
without doubt to fulfil the penance
which he had enjoyned her.—Such a
day there was difference in ſuch a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
occaſioned by a Maid, whom
Father <hi>Guardian</hi> had kept for ſome
days in his Chamber, which being
diſcovered by the Father <hi>Vicar,</hi> and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30280:29"/>
other religious perſons ſwore, they
would make a noiſe, unleſs they
had ſome ſhare in the prize. The
Father <hi>Guardian</hi> could not agree to
it, becauſe the wench had been his
Creature a long time. But at laſt,
to prevent the noiſe and ſcandal, he
quitted her to them, though with
much ado; for he keeps her with the
money, which he gets for the Books
of Devotion he makes; for Maſs,
which good people cauſe him to ſay,
and for the Octaves he Preaches.</q>

               <p>It would be a moſt excellent

to ſtick up ſuch Papers. But what

it for example ſake, or for things

            <sp>

               <p>He cannot keep her with more

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, but he makes a profane uſe
of them. Alas, what would good St.
<hi>Francis</hi> ſay, if he ſhould again return
into this world, and behold ſuch exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
things!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>What would he ſay, if he ſaw
<hi>Cordeliers</hi> take their Hood off their
heads, and cover a great Bottle with
it, ſinging round about it Bacchanal
Songs; if he ſaw them ſtigmatized
with no other marks, but ſuch as they
give one another; or ſuch as <hi>Cancers</hi>
and <hi>Buboes</hi> have left behind them!
How would he be ſurpriſed, in caſe
he was informed, that Carouſing
Monks, after their having given
Wenches a Collation in the Church,
the doors being ſhut, ſhould throw
themſelves upon them, and flea their
very Breſts by their exceſſive kiſſing
and rubbing them with their great
Beards? What would that good Saint
ſay, if word was brought him, that a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30280:30"/>
                  <hi>Capuchin,</hi> debauching himſelf in a houſe
in the Country, cauſed a dozen ſmall
Butter-flies to be tyed to his Beard,
and made twenty Capers in that ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
condition? What would it be
if all the holy Patriarchs did come to
keep grand days, each in his order, in
caſe they found within the ſmall
Caves of their religious perſons, Bawdy-Books,
Love-letters, Aſſignation-notes,
Sweet-meats, Muſcadine, <hi>Roſa ſolis,</hi>
Dice, Cards. Tobacco and Pipes; if
they ſaw religious perſons Carowſing
a whole night amongſt Pots and Claſſes,
burning out the Candles which their
Benefactors had beſtowed upon them
at their begging? If they heard them
blaſpheme God like Archers, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more inſolencies and villanies, than
Soldiers boys belonging to an Army
would ſpeak? What would it be, in
caſe they found ſome, who after their
having debauched themſelves for one
part of the night, had ſtripped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſtark-naked, and danced in that
manner, in infamous poſtures, which
was done in a Monaſtry of the <hi>Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed?</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:30280:31"/>
If they were acquainted, that
religious perſons at their coming from
Preaching, ſhould have ſhew'd to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant-maids
their Privy-parts? that
Maids who come to them complain,
that in their confeſſing them, they
put their hands between their Breſts
and Thighs. What would St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
ſay, who was afraid to inhabit under
the ſame roof with his Siſter, if he
found debauched Wenches in their
Chambers? If he ſaw ſome of them
go publickly to Bawdy-houſes? If he
found them armed with Trencher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knives,
and ready to cut one anothers
throats, as they did two years ſince
in a great Convent at <hi>Paris?</hi> What
would St. <hi>Dominicus</hi> ſay, if he beheld
<hi>Jacobins</hi> wear Holland-ſhirts, Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtockins,
a Chamlet-Coat, with Silver-Galoon,
a white Scarf with Golden
Fringe, under the habit he gave them?
What would St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> that
good man, not ſay, if he found Piſtols
in religious perſons Pockets, and
Sword-Blades in their ſticks? If he
heard, that in one of their Miſſions,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30280:31"/>
three of his did keep and entertain for
two months a debauched Wench? If
<hi>Minimes</hi> were named to him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Parlour of Nuns, ſhould have
tucked up their Gowns, and for half
an hours time danced before them?
What would <hi>Helias</hi> ſay, if he found
a <hi>Carmelite,</hi> that had broken his Leg
by falling into a Well, without a brim,
when he was croſſing a garden in the
night, intending to go lye with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?
[<hi>N. B.</hi> the Author only touches
here the moſt common things, and
ſuppreſſes ſuch ſtories as would cauſe
horrour.] In ſhort, once more, What
would that good St. <hi>Francis</hi> ſay, if
he ſaw that his Children have moſt
ignominiouſly cauſed his Will to be
annulled?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>How, annul his Will?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Why, then you know not what
it is that good Saint obliged them to
by his Will, foreſeeing the evils
which idleneſs would bring upon them:
he bound them to work, and to live
by the labour of their hands; forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to have recourſe to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30280:32"/>
unleſs their labour was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for their maintenance? But
they, to whom this clauſe was too bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom,
cauſed ſentence to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by <hi>Nich.</hi> 3. and <hi>Gregory</hi> 9. to abſolve
them from any obligation of keeping
to this Will, as being of no force nor
validity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Alas, idle fellows! if ever they
come a-begging to my houſe, I ſhall
ſend them packing, both their ſelves
and their Aſs, to the Will of their
Father.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Speaking of their Aſs, you put
me in mind of the Golden-Aſs of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puleius,</hi>
to whom this Author cauſed
to be pleaſantly rehearſed the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of certain Prieſts of the Goddeſs
of <hi>Syria.</hi> That Aſs then reports, that
thoſe people did frequent the Villages,
ſhewing the <hi>Effigies</hi> of their Gods,
promiſing Country-people, that they
ſhould be proſperous and favourable;
that in expoſing their Idols, people did
offer them in requital Copper and
Silver-money, which thoſe mumpers
did pocket up very conveniently: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30280:32"/>
thoſe offerings, there was given
them, Wine, Milk, Cheeſe, Wheat, Rye,
Herbs, which they did put in Bags
and Bottles, brought on purpoſe. All
that, ſays that poor Aſs, both Gods,
and what they had begged, was laid
on my back, and after that theſe
Quacks had Forraged whole Countries
throughout, I was led home fully
laden, and out of breath, to lay up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,

they had the gift of the Tongue, as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi>
Aſs had; for the Monks who
ſweep away all they can in houſes of
poor Countrey-people, they beg
Wheat, Wine, Eggs, Oyl, Butter, Cheeſe,

               <p>All this is nothing: there was
one, who after the Canonizing of St.

had ſome devotion for that Saint,
run through the Villages, expoſing to
view that Saints reliques, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
in a ſmall Caſquet covered with
Taffety, which they did preſent to
young women to be kiſſed; receiving
with a great deal of devotion the
money which they gave them to ſay
Maſſes, although his rule did forbid
the taking of any; but he alledged,
that in this caſe it was permitted him.
By miſhap he went to ſell his Balſam

               <p>O the Shirks, the Mountebanks!
it was a hard thing for me to believe
what lately a Gentleman of <hi>Dauphine</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:30280:34"/>
was telling me concerning thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
but I now believe it. He acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me that two <hi>Recolletts,</hi> begging in
his Neighbour-hood, went to take
their Lodging in a good Citizens houſe,
who did commonly receive them, and
made them ſup with two good fellows
of his Friends, who were alſo at his
houſe; who ſeeing theſe two Monks of a
good humour, made them drink heartily.
After ſupper, theſe two Lay-men would
ſmoak, and theſe two religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
joyned with them, and ſmoaked
alſo; then they began to drink again,
afterwards to dance, and my religious
perſons did the like. In fine, they
did ſo debauch themſelves, that they
took off their hoods, and put on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cloathes, and ſo went in company
with thoſe Lay-men, to paſs the reſt of
the night in drinking in an Ale-houſe,
to ſmoak, dance, and kiſs the Maids.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>By that means they obſerve very
well the rule <hi>ad litteram;</hi> but ſeeing we
are diſcourſing concerning thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
I will impart unto you ſomething
remarkable, which <hi>Alcippus,</hi> whom you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30280:34"/>
know very well, did the laſt winter:
he perceived two going out of their
Convent on a ſnowy day, each having
his ſtaff, and a certain Rocket, which
they put over their Coats: being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
to ſee ſuch people go abroad
in ſuch bad weather, and in a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
habit, he had a mind to know
what would become of them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he followed them, and as they
paſſed through the ſtreets, women
cryed out, Alas, where go thoſe poor
Fathers this weather! he ſtill follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them by his eye, he ſaw them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Widows houſe and within a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
after the Maid goes out with a
Flaggon, and a Napkin, to a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Cooks
for ſome Wine and a Pye.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Without doubt they did make
that woman believe that they came out
of the Countrey, and that they were
almoſt ſtarved for hunger and cold.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis likely ſo: they continued
there about an hour, and having gone
forth, they fetched a great Circuit, and
returning by another way, other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſaid the ſame; O do you ſee thoſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30280:35"/>
good Fathers? Whence can they come
this bad weather? Alas, how much
do they endure to gain Paradiſe!
without doubt they come from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome ſick perſon in the Countrey.
<hi>Jeſu Maria,</hi> how much they endure!
My Blades having accompliſhed this
fair journey, went to ſecure themſelves
in their Convent.</p>

at the gate is heard to Ring; where

               <p>I have notwithſtanding had very
good chear with them. I was invited
to their Convent by one of the Lords
of the Order, who treated me moſt
excellently well. As ſoon as he had
me within, he introduced me to the
Guardian, and to another of the chief.
Sir, ſays he, here is one of our Friends,
whom we ought not to miſtruſt; he
receives us at his houſe when we go
thither, and did us the honour two
years ſince to Preach here; and it is
very reaſonable we ſhould treat him.
Mum for that, ſays the Father <hi>Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi>
but how ſhall we do? We muſt,
ſaid he who had invited me, ſend
Brother <hi>Lewis</hi> with the Brother Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to carry a Colliflower to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General,
and they will acquaint
him that we have with us one of
our Benefactors, who is come to ſee
us as he paſt by, whom we deſire to
treat with a Bottle of good Wine:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30280:36"/>
from thence they will go to the Lady
his Mother, who is devoted to your
Reverence; ſhe will make a Pye, or
a Cake, in caſe ſhe be alſo acquainted,
we have this Friend here. The Hoſteſs
of the Golden-Croſs, who is a good
Friend to Father <hi>Ralph,</hi> will, 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſend us a Woodcock or two, or a fat
Capon, and, if your Reverence like
it, a bit of Veal may be taken up at
the Kings Attorneys Butchers, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the leave he hath given us,
which we will ſend to be baked at
Mrs. <hi>Fluries.</hi> Father <hi>Guardian,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given theſe orders, in leſs than
two hours time comes twice as much
as meat as was required. The Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
ſends ſix pints of moſt excellent
Wine, the Hoſteſs at the Golden-Croſs
two Woodcocks, Father <hi>Guardians</hi>
devout Lady, beſides a Pye of Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes,
ſent Cakes, Biskets and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckroons,
and Mrs. <hi>Fluries</hi> added a large

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>You have named one Father
<hi>Ralph:</hi> I knew in <hi>Averna</hi> one of that
name, whoſe Beads, as he ſaid, had the
vertue to cauſe barren women prove
with Child. So that there was no
barren women in any place, where
that Father had been, but were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
to make uſe of Father <hi>Ralph's</hi>
Beads.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I know not if he be the ſame,
they have amongſt them ſeveral of

of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> I would fain know
why thoſe ſame, and the <hi>Barefooted
Auguſtins</hi> wear thoſe great Hoods like
an Hypocras-bag.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I'le tell you then: as that Bag
ſerves to refine and rectifie Liquors,
ſeparating the pure from the impure;
ſo thoſe people have purified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s and St. <hi>Auſtins</hi>
Order, and having filtered as it were
thoſe two Orders, in memory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>You have at this time paid me,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30280:37"/>
all your arrears: but what do you ſay
of their great Beards?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay, they are at preſent what
they were formerly, the ſacred For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
in the midſt whereof the Gods
had their Oracles; that their hair are
pretious excrements, and are as many
ſmall threds, wherewith <hi>Cupid</hi> chains
Ladys hearts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>You have again ſatisfied me this
time, I would fain make love to thoſe
Beards.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>What, to thoſe Beards? You
never ſaw any thing ſo gallant; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my faith I jeſt not, but ſpeak in good
earneſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, with this ridiculous garb
and theſe naked feet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Alas, ſo far is it from being a
hinderance, that I will make it appear
to you, it doth promote their paſſion.
Firſt, Women have extravagant and
irregular appetites, which is the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that they fancy thoſe <hi>Satyres.</hi>
Secondly, When they are in love,
they have great care to keep their
arms and their feet white, to make
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30280:38"/>
that curious Sex greedy to pry very
far in them, whereby they affect deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their ſight and imagination, which
being gained, I give you leave to
judg whether the reſt make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>What you ſay in this, is very
likely.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore on this ſubject, I will
make you laugh at an adventure,
which befel a friend of mine at <hi>Lyons,</hi>
whither he went laſt winter about ſome
affairs. He lodged at a Widows houſe
infatuated by thoſe hooded fellows;
and he told me, that upon a <hi>Sunday</hi>
after dinner, having kept himſelf in
his Chamber a writing till two of the
Clock, and intending to ſeal his Letters,
there being no Maid to bring him
a Candle; the Miſtris having ſent her
to obtain pardons from the <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
he went to the Kitchin to light
his Wax-Candle, where he found his
Landlady roſting two Woodcocks and
two Partridges. The man ſeeing this
fine preparation, ſaid to the Woman,
Madam, what is the meaning of this?
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30280:38"/>
do you make a Wedding to day? no,
ſays ſhe, it is for ſome Gentlemen,
who are playing at our Neighbours,
that have prayed me to let theſe
be roaſted here, becauſe their Jack is
broke: he returning to his Chamber,
ſaw upon the ſtairs two <hi>Barefooted
Auſtin</hi>-Fryers, to whom immediately
the Landlady did open the door.
This cauſed him to defer ſealing his
Letters, to ſee the reſult of things:
in the interim while the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady
was ſhowing them to a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
he returns into the kitchin, and
ſlips into a Chamber joyning to that
which they were gone into, and which
was only parted with a Wainſcot-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition:
by good-luck there was in that
room a Table covered with a Carpet,
which reach'd down to the feet of it:
there my man hides himſelf, where he
over-heard pleaſant things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>This is worth a great deal of
Money.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>The Landlady then having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
thoſe two black <hi>Capuchines</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the other room, told them, that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:30280:39"/>
Mrs. <hi>Jane</hi> would come immediately,
that in the mean while ſhe muſt needs
make a ſtep into the Kitchin: then
he heard one of thoſe <hi>Auguſtins</hi> ask
the other for his Comb, and without
doubt it was to Comb his Beard. It
was no ſooner done, but Mrs. <hi>Jane</hi>
came in: This Father which had ſpoke
before, told her, You are moſt hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
welcom, you have delivered me
from a great pain, I did even tremble
for fear leſt you ſhould not come at
all. I did not intend to fail you,
replys Mrs. <hi>Jane;</hi> I have ſent my Maid
to hear the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> who are peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which keep them long, and told
her that I went to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula</hi>'s: you
are, ſaid the Father, the moſt obliging
and moſt lovely perſon in the world:
Well, well, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Jane,</hi> let us bar
complements at this time: O what
a warm hand is here, ſays the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Ah, do but mind the fervour
of my ſoul: you are a great kiſſer,
ſaith Mrs. <hi>Jane,</hi> what a white arm is
that? not ſo white as that fair breſt,
replys the <hi>Auguſtin.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:30280:39"/>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>And what did his companion do
in the mean while?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>You ask me the ſame queſtion,
which I did that Friend, he went
preſently, ſaid he to me, to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady,
who ſaid, O how plump they
are! <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and how white tool (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt he did ſhew her his legs).
After this the Roaſt-meat being ſet
upon the Table, come ſay they, we
muſt diſpatch; here, ſhall us waſh?
I love mightily that good Father <hi>N.</hi>
ſays the Landlady, he hath helped to
Cook the meat: ſee how his ſleeves
are tuck'd up, he hath reaſon to ſhew
his naked arms, for upon my faith,
they are very white: I had rather ſee
that white skin, than all the ſmall
Goſlings of our Town: you would
not think, added ſhe, that one of our
boarders came into the Kitchin whilſt
I was turning the ſpit, whom I fob'd
off with a pretence, that it was for
ſome Gentlemen who were playing at
one of our She-neighbours, who had
brought it me here to Roaſt, becauſe
her Jack was broke; he ſwallow'd the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30280:40"/>
Gudgeon preſently, and ſo went up
to his Chamber again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhould not have been able to

friend was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Why, he was very near ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all (as he told me), and was
forced to go from under the Table,
not being able to contain from laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any longer; beſides, he was in
haſte to carry his Letter to the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
and had it not been for that,
he had heard the end of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly he heard enough: but
who'd have thought ſo much of theſe

               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Why do you give them that

            <sp>

               <p>You have hit better than you
thought for: Do you know what
<hi>Turlupin</hi> means? They were a ſort of
Hereticks, who ſaid we ought not to
be aſhamed to ſhew thoſe members
which nature had given us: ſo that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30280:40"/>
you have nick'd the right name for
'em exactly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I am glad of it: I will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
call all <hi>Barefooted Monks</hi> by
no other name than <hi>Turlupines.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>You may call them <hi>Nudipedales,</hi>
who were another ſort of Hereticks,
that, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that perfection only conſiſted
in going bare-footed</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>The word <hi>Turlupins</hi> pleaſes me
better than that of <hi>Nudipedales,</hi> and
therefore I will keep to that: but is
it not a horrible thing then, that
thoſe <hi>Turlupines</hi> ſhould draw on wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

               <p>You cannot imagine how much
they are tormented about it, and

other. <hi>Monks</hi> which are ſhaved. Theſe
fools ſpend whole hours to pluck out
gray-hairs, to root out thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of age, to black their Beards:
and when they are with their women,
they will tell them that they are but
five and thirty years of age, that the
great Auſterities, and continual Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and inconveniencies of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious

               <p>Ah truly, the compariſon is not
amiſs, you always make ſome ſcurvy
application of Scriptures; but yet at
laſt ſay what you can, they are not
all of an amorous complexion, nor
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:30280:41"/>
do they all take pains to pluck hairs
out of their Beards.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Thoſe that are not tainted
with that folly, look upon themſelves
to be States-men, and ſet up for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors
and Councellors, wherein their
Beards is a mighty help to them;
for although it be not a certain ſign
of Wiſdom, the ſeat of that virtue
being in the brain, and not in the
chin; yet the ſpirit of man, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as it is, ſuffers it ſelf to be cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by thoſe fooliſh appearances. Hence
it is that a Magiſtrate will appear to
us more majeſtick in his Robes, a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
more awful in his pontifical ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
and ſo likewiſe a Monk more
wiſe and venerable with a long Beard.
Thoſe therefore amongſt them, who
are more inclined to ambition than
love, apply themſelves to make
higher Conqueſts, and to govern the
minds of great ones. They inſinuate
themſelves into their houſes by their
addreſſes, and keep themſelves there by
flattery, and by that falſe ſign of honeſty
which hangs at their chin: as in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:30280:42"/>
they profeſs they have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all pretenſions and intereſts upon
the face of the earth, and that they
have abſolutely devoted themſelves to
God, and to the ſtudy of Wiſdom;
their flattery is therefore ſo much the
more dangerous, and of greater effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy;
for a perſon of Quality, were
he the greateſt fool upon earth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forbear having a high eſteem of
his perſon, ſeeing himſelf ſo extoll'd
by people, he believes to have a right
in the ſharing of glory: and thus he
will take for his own merit, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
and venerations that thoſe
Loobies give only to his Authority,
or to his great Eſtate.</p>

               <p>In this you ſay nothing but

               <p>I own it, for all generally do
uſe ſubtilty and flattery; but you
muſt agree with me, that great Beards
cauſing religious perſons to appear
more venerable, and ſerving them as
it were for Letters of Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thoſe who are endued with
that prerogative, have a marvelous
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30280:42"/>
advantage over the other; for if all
them have the knack to inſinuate and
root themſelves in the minds and
houſes of great ones, it may be ſaid
of thoſe that they do there eſtabliſh
themſelves highly and profoundly in
length and breadth, according to all
the dimenſions of their Beards.</p>

               <p>Yea very well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
Chaplain to an old <hi>Don,</hi> who
had been in the Wars, and there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
got vaſt riches, he left off all
buſineſs to ſpend the remainder of
his days in Tranquillity, and at eaſe;
he commonly kept himſelf in a fair
houſe, which he had two Leagues off
<hi>Paris,</hi> where he was very often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
by religious perſons: he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them all with great kindneſs,
taking a world of delight and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in their company; alſo thoſe
people did extremely well act their
parts in all the viſits they gave him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis that wherein they cannot
err, they know a man before ever
they have ſeen him, they know the
qualities of his body and mind, what
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30280:43"/>
his ability is, and which are his blind
ſides; they ſee that in the memoirs
they find within the Convent, where
perſons of Quality, with whom they
have ſome concerns, or at leaſt will
pretend it, are deſcribed to the life,
from head to foot; ſo that they are
only to conform their ſteps and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
according to thoſe rules; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being provided with theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
they take for fundamental
maxims, never to loſe the ſight, the
humour and inclinations of the party
with whom they have to do, always
to be with them, and to calculate
all their diſcourſes and motions to
the meridian of their tempers. By
this means they ſeize on a mans mind
at the firſt ſally, and as I may ſo ſpeak,
make him a Proſelite to them by a
crafty Countermine. But this is not
the ſole advantage which they have,
for as Monks make it much their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to travel up and down almoſt
all Countries, and ſo conſequently
can't but meet with ſeveral perſons,
who have either ſeen <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:30280:43"/>
or elſe a great part of <hi>France,</hi> thoſe
things they have taken notice of, are
of a moſt ſingular help and ſervice to
them, and that makes them to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pleaſant and charming in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations:
moreover, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with many excellent Recipes,
even for moſt ſort of diſtempers; for
you muſt know, all Monks are Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians,
they underſtand Buildings, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
Trees, Flowers, Fountains; nay
they alſo make Preſents of ſeeds from
Foreign Countries, which cauſes them
to get many a good meals meat. All
this joyned to a great ſtock of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and flattery, makes them to
be received everywhere, ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no door is ſhut againſt them,
nay not ſo much as the Cloſet.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>It is true: but if they have the
good luck to meet with any perſon of

I warrant you they know to a hairs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth
how to make a mouth of
him.</p>

               <p>'Tis what I was juſt a-going to
acquaint you with, O, it is Nuts and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30280:44"/>
Sack to them, when they have got ſo
far. When I was a Preacher at <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,</hi>
will one ſay, I had all the chief
members of Parliament for my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
good friends. I cauſed a ſuit-in-law
to be recovered for a Gentleman
of <hi>Languedock,</hi> and Son to one of our
Benefactors, where the concern was
above 6000 Livres <hi>per annum;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
his Adverſary was one of the
eminenteſt in all the Province, never
was any buſineſs carried on with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
vehemence againſt one by an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
party, than that was; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
I got the better for him,
by the influence I had over my friends
on the bench. When e're I happen to
go to that good Gentlemans, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
me, falls about my neck and
kiſſes me, and calls me his Protector,
his Tutelar Angel, his Saviour, which
makes me to ſhun as much as I can
going to his houſe, becauſe when I
once am there, he'l hardly ever let me
get away from him again. Another
of them peradventure will ſay, That
all the two years that he hath liv'd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30280:44"/>
at <hi>Provence,</hi> a Coach was continually
at the door of the <hi>Convent,</hi> either
from the <hi>Kings</hi> Lieutenant, or from
Monſieur the Intendent, to have him
thither; that there was ſuch ſtriving
for his company, that he could not
be at one perſons houſe, without giving
jealouſie to another; and it was that
only conſideration which cauſed him
to leave that Countrey, in the which
he could not enjoy a moments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
to himſelf; that he daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the moſt obliging Letters in
the world, to invite him to a return,
that he muſt of neceſſity feign an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dipoſition
to defend himſelf from
their extreme civilities; and that he
very much fears, leſt thoſe perſons,
who are of moſt Authority there, will
obtain from the General an expreſs
order to command his return.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>About ſix Months ſince I had
one of them at my houſe, juſt in the
ſame condition: 'twas a <hi>Tierſair,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with a moſt lovely Bread; he
came from <hi>Paris,</hi> where he had dwelt
a year, having been ſent thither about
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30280:45"/>
ſome affairs concerning his Province:
he acquainted me, that his imploy
having cauſed him to be known to a
great many of the Grandees at Court,
he had had the happineſs to make
them all his Friends; that he had
brought from <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence he
came before his going to <hi>Paris,</hi> Beads
and very rare Meddals, which he had
preſented to Princeſſes, Dutcheſſes, and
Marchioneſſes; that thoſe ſmall trifles
had procured him a very great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
and familiarity amongſt them.
That there came none to hear him
Preach, being at <hi>Paris,</hi> but ſuch as
kept a ruſtling in their Velvets and
Brocards; and that he ſpent all the
afternoon in <hi>Alcoves,</hi> and with the
Ladies, ſitting down by them upon
their beds. He further told me, that
notwithſtanding the multitude of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes
which he had, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
viſits he was fain to make; yet
he could not defend himſelf from
Preaching ten or twelve times, being
ſo extremely ſolicited thereunto by
perſons of the higheſt Quality, who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:30280:45"/>
did, as it were, drag him into the
Pulpit, that he had Preach'd at St.
<hi>Germans</hi> of <hi>Auxerois,</hi> at St. <hi>Euſtas,</hi>
at <hi>Notradama,</hi> at St. <hi>Andre</hi> Deans, at
St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> in the Fields, at St. <hi>Severin,</hi>
at the <hi>Valdegrace,</hi> at the <hi>Carmelites,

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Ha! here was good ſtore of

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I did not omit it: he told me
he had been offered three Pulpits,
and that he could not accept of one
for a certain reaſon, which he then
told me: as I remember it was, becauſe
he was to be at the general Chapter,
which was to be held the <hi>Lent</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing.</p>

               <p>Preaching is one of the moſt

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Yes indeed, I think 'tis the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of all: they will ſeverely baldernoe
you in their Sermons at <hi>Lent, Advent,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:30280:46"/>
the <hi>Octaves,</hi> with their deſigns, ideas,
thoughts, diviſions; with their firſt,
and ſecond, and third points, and it
ſhall pleaſe you. O! you will not
find one that hath not Preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Parliament: and is not this to
fall from heaven, will they ſay to
you, after that they have Preach'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Parliament at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and
at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> to come and take up with
a diminutive Pariſh? to Preach to
pittiful ink-ſops, pettifoggers, and
rake fcum-notaries? But yet, as deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
as it is, it is an employment which
I have voluntarily courted, and I will
ſtrive to lower my ſelf, even to their
reaches, and to accommodate my ſelf
according to their capacity. I will
retrench from my Sermons, whatever
is eloquent, refined, and raiſed, that
ſo I may not caſt pearls before ſwine;
I will utter only the moſt Moral, and
the moſt Palpable truths; I can do
that playing, and with the greateſt
eaſe and refreſhing to me imaginable;
thereby I ſhall be diſpenſed withal,
from riſing at mid-night, and going
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:30280:46"/>
to the quire at other hours.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>That is to ſay, that your old

<hi>Beaſts,</hi> that had eyes before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
<hi>in circuitu ſedis quatuor animalia

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>That paſſage pretty well explains

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>But then we muſt ſay, that they

               <p>Theſe did not ſeem to intend

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:30280:47"/>
concerning the ſhortneſs of this life,
of the Contempt we ought to have
of theſe earthly, vain, and periſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
goods; of the abſolute neceſſity
of minding our eternal ſalvation; on
the uncertainty of the hour of death;
on the need that Chriſtians have to

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>That their ſuffrages were very

when they once come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
another perſons fortune, do take

for them; that they forget the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of them with the ſound of the

was no better way in the world could

Communities that are compos'd of a

               <p>Theſe were the ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
wherewith they did trouble
the ears of thoſe good people. In
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:30280:48"/>
ſhort, thoſe four orders did preſent
themſelves like a Chariot with four
wheels, to lead them to <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> the
<hi>Jacobins</hi> had inrowled themſelves in
the fraternity of St. <hi>Roſair,</hi> the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites</hi>
in that of <hi>Scapulary,</hi> the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins</hi>
had given themſelves Letters of
filiation, and the <hi>Auguſtins</hi> the girdle
of their glorious <hi>Patriarch.</hi> Every
one of theſe orders was welcome
for ſome particular reaſon or other;
the <hi>Jacobins</hi> were conſidered for the
ſake of St. <hi>Dominicus,</hi> whoſe name
Monſieur was off. The Lady did love
the <hi>Capuchins</hi> for the ſake of St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
of <hi>Aſſize;</hi> becauſe ſhe was eaſed
of a pain in the reins, when ever ſhe
did ſit down.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Carmelites</hi> were reverenced

becauſe of the great miracles, which
were reported to be wrought by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

at <hi>Lyons</hi> in their Church of the <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-Croſs.</hi>

               <p>The three Laws (<hi>ſays he</hi>) that of

                  <hi>Adam,</hi> and to his wife Coats of skins,
they were to wear a girdle of the ſame
ſtuff: as for the written law, it is not
permitted us to revoke it, in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Prophet Elias did not wear it
upon his reins. See the ſixth Book of

               <p>Many have thought (<hi>ſaid he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>)
that the girdle of the Apoſtles,

men and angels, hath vouchſafed to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Leather-girdle, by the holy
and ſacred incircling of her Virgin-body,
wearing it about her Reins? would it
not be to exalt and raiſe the honour,
nobleneſs, and dignity of this girdle, to
the height and extremity of its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
Paulinus Bergomenſis, <hi>and the
Reverend Father Brother</hi> Auſtin <hi>of</hi>
Tolentine. <hi>The Lady being afraid
of thoſe Citations, which this Father
was going to huddle over to her, very
fairly told him, that ſhe had had about
her that bleſſed girdle above this
twelve month: and who gave it you,
replyed the</hi> Auguſtins, <hi>ſeeing that
his Cake was like to prove dough: it
was, ſaith ſhe, the Reverend, Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
Auguſtin-<hi>Fathers. There are no
other reformed</hi> Auguſtins <hi>than we, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
briskly this</hi> Monk; <hi>I mean the little
Fathers, ſays the Lady: they are very
little Fathers in compariſon of us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
again the</hi> Auguſtin, <hi>and know,
Madam, that we are the true reformed</hi>
Auguſtins: <hi>it doth not belong to the</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:30280:50"/>
Barefooted <hi>ones to give the girdle of
St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>for that belongs only to us.
Are they not of St.</hi> Auſtins <hi>order,
ſaith the Lady to him again? no, they
are not, replyed the</hi> Auguſtins. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
happened to come in a</hi> Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed
Auguſtin, <hi>juſt as if</hi> God <hi>had ſent
him thither directly on purpoſe;
which made the poor Lady preſently
to cry out, Father, you are come ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fortunately, to defend your own
cauſe. This Father here ſays, that it
doth not belong to you to give St.</hi>
Auſtins <hi>girdle; and why not, ſaith the</hi>
Barefooted-<hi>Monk? are we not</hi> Fryers
<hi>of St.</hi> Auſtins <hi>order? no, you are not,
ſaith the other,</hi> Our Father St. Auſtin
by his writing, confeſſes himſelf, and
owns that being a Monk, he was not
Barefooted, neither could he endure it,
although living in a hot Climate, as
Affrica was. <hi>See here his own words
in his firſt Sermon of the Apoſtles,</hi>
Chap. 6. <hi>where he ſays,</hi> Calceamenta
quibus utimur, coria mortuorum ſunt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
tegmina pedum. The ſhooes which
we uſe are made of the skins of dead
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:30280:51"/>
beaſts, and ſerve for coverings to our
feet. <hi>This is for the going ſhooed,
and for the great ſleeves,</hi> the Bull of
<hi>Alexander</hi> the fourth is formal, which
ſaith, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Priores univerſi, ac ſinguli

that all the Priors, and all the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſons of the order of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
ſhould be cloathed with their antient
cloathes, wearing broad and long ſleeves,
whence it follows (<hi>which he added</hi>)
that there are no other beſides the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtins</hi>
wearing ſhooes and ſtockings, and
with great ſleeves, who follow the true
inſtitution of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and who are
his true religious perſons.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>What could the <hi>Barefooted</hi> ones
anſwer againſt ſuch concluding rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for going with ſhooes on, and for
the ſleeves too? As for my part, I
ſhould have adjudged the girdle for
thoſe who wear ſhooes, and not to the
<hi>Barefooted.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>The little Father knew very
well how to ward off the blow; he
ſaid that the true Monks of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi>
order ought not ſo much to tye
themſelves to his habit, to his wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſhooes, and to his ſleeves, as to
his vertues; and that thoſe were his
true Children, who were religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers
of him in goodneſs, rather
than in exterior things, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
nothing to perfection. This
hypocritical and ſpecious anſwer did
ſo much pleaſe the old Gentleman and
his Lady, that the other, whatever he
alledged, could not be heard; ſo that
he went away highly incenſed, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to his enemy the field free and
open.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>So then, the controverſie was
decided in favour of the little <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtins</hi>
as to the diſtribution of the
girdle</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, this affair was diſpatched;
but the reformed <hi>Monk</hi> knew much
better how to gird it about the good
old Ladies waſte, aſſuring her, that it
had been ſent by Reverend Fathe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:30280:52"/>
                  <hi>Barnard</hi> (called the Father of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles),
who had bleſſed it, and cauſed
it to touch all their reliques of the

            <sp>

               <p>But was their no jealouſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, you may eaſily imagine it:
as much, becauſe they did all make
their viſits to one and the ſame end,
as becauſe every one of them did cry
up his own order above all the reſt.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but what did thoſe juglers
ſay then?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Carmelites</hi> did attribute to

from the time of the written law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Advent</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that
they were deſcended from <hi>Elias,</hi> that
their orders were before all the reſt;
<hi>That he was the fountain of</hi> Elias, <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
down from mount</hi> Carmel, <hi>and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been inſtituted by</hi> Elias, <hi>had been

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>That obſervation is very pretty.
I never heard before that St. <hi>John</hi>

                  <hi>That it was he, who reſtored and
renewed it in the new-law, that their
order was to endure to the end of the
world, to oppoſe his founder</hi> Elias <hi>to

by</hi> Honoricus <hi>the fourth, from the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of Princes and Biſhops;</hi> that
they were the Brothers of the Virgin,
that there were three years of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
for thoſe who ſhould call

did brag of their rooting out the

               <p>One day the Phyſician being
come about ſome indiſpoſition of our
good old Lady, one of theſe <hi>Auguſtins</hi>
which were there, acquainted us with
a miracle newly wrought upon a young
maiden, named <hi>Joane Mole,</hi> which had
been condemned to be hang'd at <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia,</hi>
for having thrown her Child
into a River. This <hi>Auguſtin</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me then, that a <hi>Capuchin</hi>-Fryer,
named (if I forget not) Father <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celin</hi>
of <hi>Montel,</hi> having been appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to accompany this unfortunate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to the place of execution, did
make a vow to go and ſay Maſs, and
give thanks in the <hi>Oſier</hi>-Chappel, to
the <hi>holy Virgin,</hi> in caſe ſhe did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
this maiden from this infamous
death The which vow being renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Capuchin</hi> at the ſight of the
Gibbet, the ſucceſs proved thus, That
after execution, the maid having been
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:30280:54"/>
cut down, was found to be alive,
and after ſome reſpite began to ſpeak.
Truly this <hi>Capuchin</hi>-Fryer made a very
equitable vow, ſays the Doctor, to
keep from the hands of Juſtice, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which had drowned her Child.
But Father, do you call this a miracle?
yes ſurely, 'tis one, replyed the <hi>Auguſtin:</hi>
ay, but I do not call that a miracle, ſays
the Phyſician, 'tis an effect which may
be attributed to a natural cauſe; for
beſides that there are examples enough
to prove that a criminal hath ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his puniſhment, may it not be
likely, that the executioner may have
been greaſed in the fiſt on the behalf
of a young woman, for whom the
<hi>Capuchin</hi> might have made vows? Alas,
Sir, miracles are not to be jeſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
ſays this <hi>Auſtin</hi>-Fryer with earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
I jeſt not with miracles, replys
the Phyſician, but I deny this to be
one; for without being in any neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to bring reaſons peculiar to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
why will you not have it ſo,
that the executioner may have ſpared
a maid, for whom a <hi>Capuchin</hi>-Fryer
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:30280:54"/>
had a kindneſs? and that being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, as it may be very probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
then it will prove but a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of love, which hath triumph'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the rope of an executioner, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it had triumphed over that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the <hi>Capuchin</hi>-Fryer. We
all burſting forth in a laughter, by
reaſon of this pleaſant joke, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was ſo confounded, that he could
not reply otherwiſe, ſave that Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
had no religion, and did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
no other Deity beſides Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

               <p>But if you pleaſe, we'l return
to thoſe Monks boaſtings. Do they

their paunches with the Lady at

every one of them in their turn fell
to talk of the miracles of their orders;

not without a great deal of reaſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
value himſelf upon the Quality
of the <hi>Virgins</hi> Brother; at laſt riſing
from table, being gone to walk in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:30280:56"/>
Garden, the <hi>Jacobin,</hi> who was a wag,
addreſſing himſelf to me, told me, We
are all much troubled, theſe Fathers,
and my ſelf, that this good Gentleman,
by reaſon of his indiſpoſition, hath
not been able to eat with us; but we
had this comfort to have dined with
two of our <hi>Saviours</hi> Uncles. How! Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſaid I? At firſt not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
what he meant: the Virgins
Brothers, replyed he, are they not our
<hi>Saviours</hi> Uncles? we all ſet our ſelves
a-laughing, but only the <hi>Carmelite,</hi> who
in a great fury ſaid unto that <hi>Jacobin,</hi>
Ah! 'tis a very fine thing indeed to
ſee a Monk laugh at our <hi>Popes</hi> Bulls;
but it is not a thing to be wondered
at, that you find occaſion of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at holy things, being of an order,
who found a way to poyſon a <hi>Pope</hi>
with the hoſte. What! did you accuſe
the whole order for the fault of one
particular perſon? ſays the <hi>Jacobin:</hi>
and you, good Sir, have you not
ſpoke it too againſt the whole order
of <hi>Carmelites?</hi> and you <hi>Carmelites,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the <hi>Jacobin,</hi> are very pleaſant
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:30280:57"/>
fellows to take upon you the Title
of Brother to the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and to make
us believe you are deſcended from
<hi>Elias,</hi> as if we were ignorant that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,
Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and
<hi>Legat</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> came to mount <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi>
the year 1160, and did there
aſſemble ſome <hi>Hermites,</hi> who had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inſtitution, nor rule, but lived
after their own fancy about that
mountain; and that he did reduce
them to a body, to whom the ſaid
<hi>Patriarch</hi> did give a <hi>Waldenſis</hi> to be
ſuperiour over them, named <hi>Barthol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus:</hi>
that before it was no religious
and monaſtick order, but only ſome
ſolitary perſons that were wandring
here and there, who being reduced
to a body, are but <hi>abortive,</hi> as <hi>Polydore
Virgil</hi> calls them; neither did they
take the figure of any religious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
till under <hi>Innocent</hi> the third,
who lived about 480 years ſince. And
you! whence come you, ſaith the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melite,</hi>
you are come from the <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liati,</hi>
who were pittiful miſerable ſlaves,
which the Emperour <hi>Frederick Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſa</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:30280:57"/>
had brought from <hi>Lombardy</hi> into
<hi>Germany,</hi> whom being come to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
themſelves at his feet, he took
pity on, and diſcharged them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
they wore white Cloathes,
juſt as you do; and it is from thoſe
people that St. <hi>Dominicus</hi> made up his
<hi>Militia.</hi> The <hi>Barefooted Auguſtin</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling
in the quarrel, ſaid to the
<hi>Carmelite,</hi> I wonder Father, that you
have made no mention of the Cloak
ſtriped with white and red, which
you heretofore did wear, and which
might ſerve to mark and blazon your
antiquity. Dare you prate of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
replyed briskly the <hi>Carmelite?</hi>
You, whoſe order hath not been on
the face of the earth above this four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
years; pittiful <hi>Poſthumes</hi> of a
Father, who dyed 1300 years before
your appearing in the world. Alas!
Father, ſays the <hi>Capuchin,</hi> who as yet
had not ſpoke a ſyllable, ought there
to be ſo much wrath and fierceneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Virgins</hi> cloathing? The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melite,</hi>
ſeeing that he likewiſe was for
a touch of railery: and what habit
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30280:58"/>
had you, ſaid he angerly? Will you
not ſay 'tis the habit of St. <hi>Francis,</hi>
which you wear? and that you are
his Children? as if it were not well
enough known, that it is one <hi>Matheus
Basky,</hi> who gave you birth, and that
you are only <hi>Baſquees, &amp;c.</hi> This quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
had in all probability laſted longer,
if there had not been a neceſſity of
quelling that of the Brother <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries,</hi>
who were ſcolding at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as if they would immediately
have gone to Fiſty-cuffs: I heard them
ſay, thou art a pretty Rogue for a

pretty a Champion of St. <hi>Come,</hi> and St.
<hi>Damien.</hi> Troth thou art a pretious
bit to give a Gliſter to our blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheeks;
yes, and you too a pure ſtick

               <p>They had for a long while ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
the haunt, and watch'd for an
opportunity to get in among them, to
accompliſh their deſign. They accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one Mrs <hi>Iſabell,</hi> who had been a
Chambermaid in that Houſe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given her the Habit and Cord of
St. <hi>Francis of Paula,</hi> they ſent her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well documentized before-hand,
to give a viſit to her old Miſtreſs: And
this cunning baggage having made her
firſt Complements, did ſo manage
her buſineſs, and ſo often handle her
Cords, that the good old Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
demanded of her what it was;
then ſhe who waited for nothing elſe,
told her, that it was St. <hi>Francis of
Paula</hi> his Cord, and you ſee, Madam,
I ſtill wear his Habit: I was very much
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:30280:59"/>
troubled with a pain in my Kidneys,
ſince I lay in laſt, and knew not how
to get any eaſe, when an old Woman,
(whom I beſeech God to bleſs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for it, and who lives near the
<hi>Minimes</hi> of <hi>Place Royal</hi>) giving me a
viſit, did counſel me to take the Habit
and Cord of St. <hi>Francis of Paula;</hi> and
ſince I have been perfectly well. Says
the old Gentlewoman, you do me the
greateſt kindneſs in the world to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
me with this news: Is there
ſuch a Friery of them? O yes, Madam,
and a very lovely one too. I do aſſure
you, that I will ſhortly get one to gird
me withall; for I have ſuch intolerable
pains in my back that they e'en diſtract
me. The good old Gentleman, who
was now pretty well recovered, came
in as we were juſt ſpeaking thus: Ah!
my Dear, ſays ſhe, do you not ſee Mrs
<hi>Isbell</hi> in the Habit, and with the Cord
of St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Paula?</hi> She tells me
that ſince ſhe hath worn it, ſhe finds
her ſelf very much relieved of a pain
ſhe had in her back, here, about the
ſmall; I will, an't pleaſe God, and if
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30280:59"/>
you will let me, Deareſt, wear that
holy Habit, and be of that Friery. I
am very well contented you ſhould,
ſays her Husband; but it were conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
that you ſhould firſt ſpeak to
one of thoſe good Fathers. Sir, replies
Mrs. <hi>Iſabell,</hi> I will take care of that, I
know one who is a moſt zealouſly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
perſon; but beſides, if you pleaſe,
I will cauſe the Taylor, who made me
this Suit, to come hither: Ay, do,
with all my heart, ſaid both the old
Folks; and preſently after, the Lady
tript away as cheerfully, as if ſhe had
been half cur'd already.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Ha! This went not much amiſs
for the firſt Scene.—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I will acquaint you with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of it. The Taylor comes the
next day to make her this Habit, and
the day following fails not to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, with the principal of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimes</hi>
of <hi>Place-Royal,</hi> a perſon of a
very venerable aſpect, and one who
had abundance of Croſſes and Meddals
hanging at his Girdle; beſides, he was
a man that could ſpeak rarely well,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:30280:60"/>
and he complemented our old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and his Lady in a moſt delicate
ſtile. I remember amongſt other things,
he ſaid, That when it was told him,
how that her Ladyſhip would be one
of the Third Order of St. <hi>Francis</hi> of
<hi>Paula,</hi> the whole Friery teſtified a
a moſt incredible joy at the news;
(for it immediately ran throughout
the whole Order) inſomuch that it
cauſed a publick acclamation there;
that it was not a greater honour for
his moſt happy <hi>Patriarch</hi> to have been
ſent for by <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI., and to have
been received at the Court of ſo great
a <hi>King,</hi> than for himſelf, to have the
freedom of Ingreſs and Regreſs into ſo
pious and devout a Family, and to
have the honour of being imployed,
to give her Ladyſhip the Habit and
Cord of his Order: That indeed both
the Habit and the Cord did appear in
the eyes of the World, but as a vile
and contemptible thing, and of a dark
and dead Colour; but that in Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem,
they were pretious, and not
only of a Lively, but of a Vivifying
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:30280:60"/>
Colour: That clothing ones ſelf with
that dark Habit, her Ladyſhip did
Cloath her ſelf with a Cloud, but that
it was of one of thoſe whereof <hi>Job</hi>
did ſpeak, which did enlighten; or
elſe of that Cloud mention'd in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
in which the Lord was pleaſed to
cauſe his Glory to appear, <hi>Gloria Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini
apparuit in nube;</hi> ſo that hereafter
he did look upon her Ladyſhip not as
a mortal perſon, but like unto that
Angel in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> whom St.
<hi>John</hi> ſaw cloathed with a Cloud.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>That Father did lift up himſelf
very much in the Clouds: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
here is on this Habit very much
Imbroidery, both of the Old and New
<hi>Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>After ſome other Complements
and Diſcourſe, not belonging to our
buſineſs; to prepare the Lady for the
worthy receiving of this Habit and
Cord, he read unto her a Lecture of
the Rule of the Third <hi>Minimetan</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
contained in a ſmall Book which
he preſented to her; how that by that
Rule, the day you are received into
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:30280:61"/>
the Friery, you muſt confeſs your ſelf
and receive the Sacrament: Therefore,
the next day, the Lady intending to
be received, did acquit her ſelf of all
thoſe pious duties in the Chappel of
the Houſe, Confeſſing her ſelf to that
good Father, hearing Maſs, receiving
the Sacrament and the Habit and Cord
at his hands; but before ſhe came to
this laſt action, this venerable <hi>Patriarch,</hi>
ſeeing you term them ſo, could not
keep himſelf from playing one of his
Pranks: He then acquainted this good
old Lady, That although by the Rule
of the Third Order of St. <hi>Francis</hi> of
<hi>Paula,</hi> Lay-people were only to have
the Cord with two Knots, as it is in
the <hi>7th page</hi> of the ſaid Rule, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
to oblige her Ladyſhip,
and to unite her to their Order by a
more particular Tye, he did bring her
a Cord with five Knots; the ſame
which theſe Monks wear who are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
with the Order of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
that by that means ſhe might
enjoy all the Immunities, Prerogatives,
Preheminences, Bleſſings and Unctions
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:30280:61"/>
belonging to the Holy <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> that
as it was an extraordinary favour
which as yet had not been granted to
any Lay perſon, that the Conceſſion
might be the more ſure and authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
he had cauſed the whole number
of Monks to aſſemble themſelves, who
unanimouſly had granted that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;
whereof there was an Act paſſed,
ſigned by the whole Fraternity, which
they would cauſe to be ratified by the
moſt Reverend Father General; which
being done, the ſaid Act ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in their Regiſter, for a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
memorial.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Ha! here were rare flouriſhes
indeed, as ſoft as your Oil of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>After this, he reads the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
which the <hi>Popes</hi> had granted
to ſuch who would be interr'd with
the Habit of their Order, or ſhould
make choice of their Church for a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
place.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Dear God! What did this good

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>He proceeded afterwards gravely,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:30280:62"/>
and with great Ceremony, to bleſs the
Habit and Cord; which being done,
the Lady undreſſed her ſelf with the
help of the Taylor, and Mrs. <hi>Iſabel,</hi>
who was aſſiſtant there, and then opens
her Arms to take that Habit ſmoaking
hot with the Bleſſings which that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had juſt then beſtowed on them;
but this <hi>Minime</hi> perceiving the Leather
Girdle which ſhe had on her Rains,
begun to ſay, bending his brows, What
do you wear there Madam? It is, ſays
ſhe, St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Girdle. O mercy! you
muſt leave it off, in caſe you will feel
the effects of this holy Habit and ſacred
Cord: 'Tis not that I am againſt this
devotion, but as the mixture of two
Drugs hinders the effect of either; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſo this Girdle and this Cord might
hinder one anothers virtue: Then I
heard him, turning himſelf to Mrs. <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
whiſper her in her ear, to make
her leave of that naſty Arſe-piece.</p>

               <p>Then returning to his Diſcourſe,
he ſaid firſt, that the Cord did in it ſelf
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:30280:62"/>
eminently contain the Girdles virtue,
and that in this occaſion, her Ladyſhip
was to practiſe the words of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
who had ſaid, <hi>Erit pro Zona funiculus,</hi>
That the Rope ſhould be in the room
of the Girdle. This poor Woman
hearing <hi>Iſaiah</hi> named, did effectually
believe that that <hi>Prophet</hi> had ſpoken
of that Cord and Girdle; ſo that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to offend by her refuſal, not only
this <hi>Fryer,</hi> but alſo <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſhe left off
the Leather Girdle, to put on the
Cord.</p>

               <p>Ha, ha, ha, Where was the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Let him alone, he will appear by
and by. This Ceremony being ended,
they went to Dinner, where this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and his Companion were treated
with moſt dilicate marrionated Fiſh.
The Lady to profeſs her devotion for
her new Order, would only eat that
which had been made ready for thoſe
Religious perſons. After Dinner, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Minime</hi> having taken his leave
with all the Complements belonging to
<hi>Monks</hi> civility, it happens that the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:30280:63"/>
Lady, having eaten of that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated
Fiſh, found her ſelf very ill,
and was taken with a great pain in her
Stomach, with an extream Vomiting,
this cauſed her to go to Bed: The other
<hi>Monks,</hi> who had their Intelligencers in
the Houſe, having had notice thereof,
were immediately at her Bed-ſide, and
read ſuch a Lecture to her, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell how to expreſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>

               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Jacobin, <hi>who came firſt, not
ſeeming preſently angry to find the old
Lady enſnared in the</hi> Minime<hi>'s Cord,
told her, That he was very much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to ſee her zeal for the Frieries; yet
he could not approve of her being of
them all, it being impoſſible by that
multiplicity, to be able well to acquit
ones ſelf of each of 'em in particular;
That of all the Frieries which were in
the</hi> Church, <hi>thoſe which did moſt keep
us to the ſervice of the Mother of</hi> God
<hi>were doubtleſs the moſt excellent.</hi> But
of all the devotions which piety had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
for to honour that Virgin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all peradventure that of the holy Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:30280:63"/>
was moſt agreeable to her, the moſt
perfect, moſt meritorious, and the moſt
rich. It was the moſt agreeable, in as
much as the Roſary is a ſhortned Table,
where may almoſt be ſeen repreſented all
the Myſteries of our Religion; for thoſe
fifteen miſteries which it contains, are,
as it were, fair Images where are perfectly
beheld the Father Almighty's deſigns in
the temporal birth of his Son, the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
which happened to him during his
childhood, in his hidden and unknown
life, in his ſuffering and laborious life,
in his glorious and immortal life; and in
the ſame are alſo repreſented to us, the
chief virtues which <hi>Mary</hi> made conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
during the term of her temporal
life.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>That Diſcourſe did enlarge it ſelf

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>More meritorious; for the practice
of that devotion doth oblige us to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
the chief and moſt meritorious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
vertues, of Faith, Hope and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
For the repeating the Holy Roſary,
with the attention and devotion due to
it, the acts of a lively Faith are unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:30280:64"/>
renewed; by the Myſteries medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
upon, the acts of a perfect hope are
reiterated towards him who is our
<hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> chief good, whoſe
greatneſs and power we then conſider.
You are launched without intermiſſion
into acts of a fervent charity, by the
ſentiments of Complacency, Joy, Love,
Honours, Reſpect, and Thankſgiving
towards him who is infinitely lovely
and adorable, and whoſe love and
goodneſs we do contemplate.</p>

Roſary. Priviledges and Indulgences,
which are in greatneſs &amp; richneſs without

have granted to ſeveral Congregations,

               <p>Hey day! This Brother Frier
then preached a long-winded Sermon
to the good old Lady: In the hearing
of ſo many brave ſayings, who could
imagine thoſe people to be guilty of ſo
many horrid impieties? That they
tempt Women to ſin, yea, even in the
very time of Confeſſion? That they
make of their Churches, places of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation?
That they go into Bawdy-Houſes,
and are very much Pox'd there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Give me leave to make an end;</hi>
So he (<hi>proceeding</hi>) ſaid, It ſeems as if
the Popes had heaped together all the
treaſure of the Church, caſting them into
the Furnace, and ſo to make a Coyn in
favour of the Roſary, of an ineſtimable
price and value; and in this caſe may be
truly ſaid, what is ſet down in the Book
of Wiſdom: That many Damſels have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together vaſt riches; but that you
go beyond them all.</p>
            </sp>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:30280:65"/>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>This <hi>Dominican</hi> had very much
reaſon to quote that place of Scripture,
and to compare <hi>Frieries</hi> to ſuch Laſſes
as had got together great ſtore of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
for Frieries are your daughters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Orders, which do enrich their
Fathers. 'Tis this way that <hi>Monks</hi> get
Money out of the People: But what did
that <hi>Magpie</hi> ſay farther, for he ſeemed
to make a mighty chattering noiſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>He alſo alledged that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanus
8th</hi> had granted a Bull, whereby the
Banner of the Brotherhood of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi>
did preceed all other Banners, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
that of the Holy Sacrament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But did he ſay nothing againſt
the Habit and Cord which their old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
had taken?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Oh! yes truly he did ſay, the
ſmall ſtring wherein the <hi>Holy Roſary</hi>
was threaded, being loaden with fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> and One hundred
and fifty <hi>Ave Maria's,</hi> was incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
much more worth, and had infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more vertues than the <hi>Minimes</hi>
Cord, which at the higheſt, did not
contain above Five knots, which as to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:30280:65"/>
the Act of devotion was in no wiſe the
knot of the matter: Telling me ſoftly,
That if the Lady had a mind to take
the Habit of any Order, it had been
much better for her to have taken that
of St. <hi>Dominicus,</hi> and to wear a Black
Gown upon a White Petticoat, which
had been much more ſeemly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
than to wear that ugly Habit,
which reſembles that of a Chimney-Sweeper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>This <hi>Dominican</hi> was moſt richly
revenged of the <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Thereupon a <hi>Lacquey</hi> came to
tell her Ladyſhip, that the <hi>Capuchins</hi>
were at the Gate, who had a deſire to
kiſs her hand, and to know how ſhe
did. The Lady having given order
for their admittance, the <hi>Dominican</hi>
took his leave, and my ſelf the care of
re-conducting him. In going through
the Hall, we met with thoſe <hi>Capuchins</hi>
coming in, who ſaluted us, without
making any ſtop; but the <hi>Jacobin</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
earneſtly upon one of them, ſaid
to me, there is a Beard which is quickly
ſhot out. What do you mean (ſaid
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:30280:66"/>
I) Father? He replied, it is not ſix
Months ſince it hath been cut off.
What! do <hi>Capuchins</hi> cut off their Beards?
No, but this hath had an adventure,
like unto that of <hi>Sampſons</hi> Hair. What!
replied I, was it cut off by the hands
of ſome <hi>Dalila?</hi> (He ſmilingly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
me, that it had been cut off at
leaſt by one of her Sex): Now although
I had a good mind to have gone to hear
in what manner theſe <hi>Capuchins</hi> would
Complement the Lady about her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
and that which had been the
cauſe thereof;—Yet I choſe rather to
hearken to this Story which the <hi>Jacobin</hi>
had a mind to tell me; I pray then, ſaid
I to him, let me underſtand the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this Beard. That <hi>Capuchin,</hi>
replies he, whom you have there ſeen
with that curious Beard, was in love
at <hi>Lyons</hi> with a pretty young <hi>Nun,</hi>
(pray pardon me for not telling her
name—nor that of the <hi>Nunneries</hi>
which ſhe belonged to) this Damſel,
who was a very wag, and wanted no
wit, at firſt made as if ſhe approved of
his paſſion, to have the pleaſure to ſee
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:30280:66"/>
to what height this <hi>Satyer</hi> would puſh
on his pretenſions. One day then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
full of the good hopes he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of ſo proſperous a beginning,
he made bold to crave a kiſs of her,
which ſhe refuſed, but with an Air
which gave him no reaſon to deſpair
his obtaining of it another time. So
then the day following returns our Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
who cauſes this Laſs to be called;
ſhe hearing that it was him, goes to
him fully prepared; and the better to
accompliſh her deſign, ſhe intreats him
to go into a Parlour, which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any company. Our blade deſir'd
nothing more willingly, being come
into the Room with the object of his
devoted affection, who for that very
purpoſe received him with an inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
kindneſs, he began again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a kiſs, and to preſs her to grant
him that pledg of her love, and to
that end did advance his muſle through
one of the holes of the Grates; then
ſhe ſeemingly going to kiſs him, took
him ſoftly by the Beard, which he had
thruſt through, and at one ſnip, with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:30280:67"/>
a pair of Sciſſars ſhe had in her hand,
eaſed him of his Bruſle-buſh, ſaying
afterwards, Adieu Father, this will
ſerve me to make clean my Combs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Ha! that Roguiſh ſnip of the
Sciſſars, is as much in my eſteem, as the
blow which ſtruck off <hi>Holofernes</hi> his
Head; but in the mean time, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
by this diſcourſe, that the greateſt
enemy to <hi>Monks,</hi> are <hi>Monks</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>After I had laughed ſufficiently
with this <hi>Dominican</hi> at the adventure
of the Beard, and was rallying upon
what this unbearded Father could ſay
at his return to the Convent, I, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Without doubt he did as the Fox
in the Fable, who having had his Tail
cut off, did counſel his Companions to
cut off theirs too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>We did not fail to think of that,
and many other things beſides; after
this, I took leave of the <hi>Dominican,</hi>
in hopes ſtill to lay hold upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the <hi>Capuchins</hi> diſcourſe with
the Lady; but I came too late for that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:30280:67"/>
purpoſe, and found the Father as he
was going out, ſaying to his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
'tis a horrible thing of theſe <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimes!</hi>
how hot they are! certainly
thoſe lighted Torches which did appear
in the Houſe where St. <hi>Francis</hi> of
<hi>Paula</hi> was conceived, did betoken the
heat which ſhould proceed from his
Children: 'Tis not ſo to be interpreted
(ſaid I to him) they did ſignify the
heat of Charity, wherewith thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
perſons were to be inflamed,
whereof they alſo bear the <hi>Motto;</hi> it is
affirm'd, (replied the <hi>Capuchin</hi>) in the
Saints Life, that an Angel brought him
a <hi>Scutcheon,</hi> where was writ that word
<hi>Caritas;</hi> but it is more plainly viſible in
the life of his Children, that that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
hath carried away the <hi>Scutcheon</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Father's death; and if they
yet pretend to bear it, 'tis but with a
<hi>Croſs-barr,</hi> in token of Baſtardize. Is
it not a ſhameful thing, that thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who have Rents coming in, injoy
<hi>Priories,</hi> have Tythes, Demeans, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Lordſhips, ſhould notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
go to their little tricks and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:30280:68"/>
devices? Would you think that the
Lady ſtraight came and told me, that
the <hi>Minime,</hi> who had given her the
Habit and Cord of their Order, after
he had heard her Confeſſion, ſpoke to
her for the chuſing her burying place
in their Church, to make a foundation
for it, and to beſtow ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the building of their Portal? I
know not, ſaid I to him, what his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
could be for ſo long time, but
he kept her in talk above an hour. It
was about that, ſaid the <hi>Capuchin,</hi> that
he did entertain her; but you know
thoſe people never intend to build a
Portal, that ſo that might be always a
pretence for their continual craving
towards it: And if it be true, that by
that feigned cheat, they have received
money enough to build a hundred,
were they all to be of marble, yet this
would be a ſmall matter, if they did
not (as, <hi>ſub rosâ,</hi> betwixt our ſelves
they do) make an infamous commerce
together in the very Sacrament of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
About a year ſince, I was coming
down to <hi>Lyons</hi> by water, with <hi>Monſieur de
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:30280:68"/>
Lingendes</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Maſcon,</hi> who did
me the honour of receiving me into his
Boat; being over againſt a <hi>Convent,</hi>
which they have upon the border of
the River <hi>Saoſna,</hi> in the Principality
of <hi>Dombes;</hi> this Prelate was a telling
me, that that was the Church which
did abſolve from all crimes, giving but
a Crown to have <hi>Maſſes</hi> ſaid. Thoſe
Fathers ought to have abundance to
ſay. His <hi>Almoner,</hi> who was with him,
and who formerly had ſerved in a
neighbouring Pariſh, told us that they
did ſo mightily delude the people
round about there, that there was not
any body, never ſo little aforehand in
the World, who did not beſtow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in their favour; that upon that
very account, they had above Twelve
hundred <hi>Maſſes</hi> to ſay yearly; that no
Will was made, in which they had not
Dozens, nay Thirty, Forty Maſſes to
ſay, and annual ones alſo; that beſides
that, there yearly happened above a
Thouſand <hi>Maſſes</hi> of Devotion for them
to ſay; and moreover, there was no
body did confeſs themſelves within the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:30280:69"/>
ſaid Church, to whom they did not
ordain <hi>Maſſes</hi> for Penance; which
did amount, when they were all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
to above Eight thouſand <hi>Maſſes
per annum;</hi> That not being contented
with this, they went into the Pariſhes,
to ſuborn thoſe Heirs who were
charged to cauſe prayers to be made
for the deceaſed, aquainting them,
that they could ſay <hi>Maſſes,</hi> at leaſt as
well as <hi>Curates,</hi> and that they would
diſpatch them a great deal ſooner;
That he, being <hi>Almoner,</hi> having one
day demanded of one of thoſe Fathers,
how it was poſſible for them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
ſo many <hi>Maſſes,</hi> there being
commonly within the ſaid place not
above four or five <hi>Prieſts?</hi> That <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime</hi>
anſwered him, that the <hi>Pope</hi> had
granted them the priviledg of ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the retributions by one only

               <p>I muſt firſt tell you the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which the <hi>Carmelite</hi> made, who
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:30280:69"/>
was mightily Intereſſed, That our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſhould take up no Habit, but that
of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and who doubtleſs had
broke out into high complaints, had
not the Lady, ſeeing him coming up,
uncovered her Arm, where ſhe had
his <hi>Scapulary,</hi> and not preſented him
her hand to touch it, as if it were to
make peace: For all this, the <hi>Carmelite</hi>
did not fail to tell her, that ſhe muſt
needs have but little confidence in that
holy Habit, ſeeing ſhe could be eaſily
prevail'd upon to take another; that
he was apt to believe, ſhe had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
this error only for want of
good inſtruction, and for not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truly the worth and excellency of
that Habit of the <hi>Virgin.</hi> (A little
Habit of our Lady of Mount <hi>Carmel,
pag.</hi> 9.) Says he, <hi>If nothing be more
precious than thoſe gifts which come from
Heaven, we ought to eſteem, beyond all
conception, the Holy</hi> Scapulary, <hi>ſeeing it
hath been given us by the moſt pure
hands of the Holy Virgin, Mother of
God, and Queen of Angels, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the moſt happy St.</hi> Simon Stock,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:30280:70"/>
                  <hi>when he was General of his Order of</hi>
Carmelites; <hi>beſides, that in beſtowing
the ſame on us, ſhe hath inriched us with
all the treaſure of Grace, honoured us
with the title of her Children, even her
Brothers, armed us againſt all the perils
of life, ſtrengthned us againſt all the
temptations of the evil one, eſpecially at
the point of death, and given us a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
eaſie way, of totally freeing our ſelves
from the pains of Purgatory, or at leaſt
to have them ſoon at an end.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
he told her the words which
the holy Virgin had pronounced to
<hi>Simon Stock</hi> their General, when ſhe
ſaid to him, <hi>Receive, my beloved one,
this</hi> Scapulary <hi>of thy Order, the mark
of my Friery, and priviledg for thy ſelf

               <p>Coming to the Lady, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after the ſtate of her health, he
did all he could to keep in his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but at laſt he was fain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
himſelf thus: I have been for
ſome time, Madam, muſing at your
Gate, being in doubt where I was,
whether I ſhould come in or no, not
daring to believe that you would once
ſo much as caſt your eyes upon poor
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:30280:71"/>
                  <hi>Monks,</hi> after your having put your
ſelf under the conduct and direction of
<hi>Prelates.</hi> The Lady, who knew no
more than my ſelf, what this <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
intended to ſay, anſwered him very
mildly, that it was a long time ſince
ſhe had ſeen any of thoſe Gentlemen;
Madam, replyed the <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> all thoſe
who term themſelves <hi>Prelates</hi> have not
a Miter on; There are ſome <hi>Monks,</hi>
nay of the meaneſt of them all, who
have the vanity to attribute to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that illuſtrious name. I do not,
as yet, comprehend your meaning,
ſays ſhe to him: You have not then,
ſays the Father to her, read the Rules
of the <hi>Minimes</hi> Third Order, in which
you are inroll'd. Madam, you will
find there, that thoſe people, whom
their bleſſed <hi>Patriarch</hi> would have
termed <hi>Minimes,</hi> that is to ſay, the
leaſt of all, and to whom he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
humility for a particular Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
that thoſe people dare (I ſay)
be qualified with the title of Lords
and <hi>Prelates,</hi> even in their Rules; in
the which at leaſt they ought to make
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:30280:71"/>
a ſeeming ſhow of profeſſing that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
We have not ſeen that, replyed
the Lady, but we have here the Book,
and it will be eaſie to be ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
which Book being brought, the
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> took it, and cauſed us to
ſee, that what he had ſaid was the
truth. I read it there my ſelf, and
have ſince very often ſeen, that in the
Seventy eighth page, they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Lords: That in another place
there are theſe words (Rule of the
<hi>3d</hi> Order of St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Paula, p.</hi>
116. 122, and 139.) <hi>Then the Prelate
conducts the perſon to kiſs the Altar.</hi> In
another may be read, <hi>Then the Prelate,
and all other perſons who are preſent
ſhall fall on their knees.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Then the Prelate anſwers.</hi> Theſe
are, Madam, continued the <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
the <hi>Prelates</hi> of whom I am ſpeaking.
What! do you think that Monks have
the vanity, nay, rather impertinence,
to term themſelves Prelates, under
pretence that they have the power to
give a ſorry woollen Cord? But is it
not yet worſe, to ſee <hi>Hermites</hi> to have
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:30280:72"/>
built adjoining to the <hi>Place Royal?</hi>
The <hi>Minimes,</hi> ſaid I, interrupting him,
are they <hi>Hermites?</hi> Says he to me, they
have been inſtituted under the name of
<hi>Hermites</hi> of St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> and
approved as ſuch by <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV, and
by <hi>Alexander</hi> VI, under the name of
<hi>Hermites</hi> of the Order of <hi>Minimes.</hi> Is
not the <hi>Royal Place</hi> a lovely, curious,
<hi>Hermitage?</hi> And have they not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
meen of <hi>Hermites,</hi> with their Beards
at all times ſhaved off? Who hath ever
ſeen <hi>Hermits</hi> frolick with Ladies in the
Church? Who hath ſeen <hi>Anchorites</hi> make
preſents of <hi>Romiſh</hi> and <hi>Granoble</hi> Gloves
to Ladies, and to give them ſtately Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations?
To load them with ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats,
and to cauſe them exceſſively to
eat, what-ever is moſt exquiſite and rare
in the Shops of the Fair of St. <hi>Germans?</hi>
Have <hi>Hermits</hi> been ever ſeen playing
the Fool with Piſtols, ſmoaking, and
carouſing in Ale-houſes, as they do in
their little by-places? Who ever ſaw
<hi>Anchorites</hi> lay wagers with young-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and for a laſt inſolency, to ſhow
and offer them Purſes full of Gold?
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:30280:72"/>
Thus, Madam, do they imploy their
<hi>Maſs</hi>-Money which they impoſe upon
people for Penance; thus is laviſhed
and ſquandred away your Money of
your Stock, that of Foundations, of
Sermons, and of the Friery: and yet
theſe very perſons have had the power
to prevail with you to leave off your
Girdle of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which <hi>Elias,</hi> St.
<hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> nay the <hi>Virgin</hi> her ſelf
have not diſdained to wear. Yes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
you have left that ancient Girdle,
to take up a wretched Cord, which
hath neither virtue nor recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which is the off-caſt of ſome
ſcabby-ſheep, and whoſe firſt miracle
proved the procuring of a ſickneſs to
your ſelf. The Father ſpeaking theſe
things with an extream vehemency,
made the good Lady to be mightily
troubled at it; and ſhe told him that
in truth, ſhe had drawn ſome ill <hi>omen</hi>
from the diſcourſe the <hi>Minime</hi> had
made her, who had given her the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
and the Cord, having ſo extreamly
preſſed her to make a Foundation, and
to chuſe her Sepulchre in their Church;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:30280:73"/>
and that ſhe was angry with Mrs. <hi>Iſabel,</hi>
for having been the occaſion of her
being of that Fraternity; and that ſhe
would be glad if ſhe could tell how
handſomly to ſhake off that Habit and
Cord, in caſe ſhe knew what to do
with them. Madam, replies the <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>
as for the Habit you may give it
to ſome poor Woman, and as for the
Cord, I will make with it a Whip, to
drive out the Dogs which come to our
Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Ah! he was in inſolent Raſcal
for his pains, to profane in ſuch a
manner a Cord, which goes beyond
Blew ones.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>'Twas done as it was ſaid, there
was an Alms made of the Habit: the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
re-inveſted her ſelf with the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Girdle,
and the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> carried
away the Cord with five knots to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
in the whipping of Dogs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Alas poor Cord! thou art migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
diſgraced! But did not the <hi>Prelates</hi>
come to make their Complaints?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>The Porter had orders to deny
them admiſſion, and to acquaint them,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:30280:73"/>
that they had no buſineſs there. So
they having had notice by Mrs. <hi>Iſabel</hi>
of this ſtrange alteration, they did not
appear, and reſolved in a full Chapter,
not to give the Cord any more to old
women; neither for the time to come,
to gird any with it but young perſons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>As indeed they very punctually
do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Hereupon I had notice that my
Uncle was dying, which cauſed me with
ſpeed to depart, to prevail upon his
good nature and tenderneſs, to ſettle
me in his Benefice; ſo that I left my
old Gentleman and his Lady in the
hands of thoſe people.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>That is to ſay, in Hugſters hands.
But had they no kindred, no friend to
inlighten their eyes, that ſo they might
ſee the claws of thoſe Harpies for the
future?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>The Gentleman had for his friend
and goſſip an honeſt Citizen, one <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guillier</hi>
of St. <hi>Euſtace,</hi> who did abhor
the ſeeing thoſe innocent people ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
inſnared in thoſe Impoſtors Nets.
But he durſt not openly declare, for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:30280:74"/>
fear the <hi>Monks</hi> ſhould play him ſome
ſlippery trick. If I was not afraid (ſaid
he to me) of bringing thoſe Waſps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my ſelf, I would freely declare my
thoughts to thoſe people, and would
eaſily pluck them out of the hands of
thoſe Rake-hells; but in caſe they
ſhould diſcover that 'twas I who had
diſ-abuſed them, they would make me
to be look'd upon in my Neighborhood
for a vile wretch, and for a man that
had no Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>He had reaſon to fear it; for
when <hi>Monks</hi> do take a pick againſt any
one, they go crying them down every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
blackning and beſpattering them
in their Converſations, Confeſſions, and
in the Pulpit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not very ſad, proceeded he,
that the Garden of the Church, which
hath been planted by the Son of <hi>God,</hi>
watered by his blood, and by that of
his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and his Martyrs, ſhould be
gnawed, and eaten up by thoſe curſed
and baſe Caterpillars? That the <hi>Popes,
Kings, Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Parliaments</hi> not
being ignorant of their exceſs, do not
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:30280:74"/>
ſuppreſs them, and bring theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
and maſterleſs perſons to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
of their Rules. I have admired
a Thouſand times, how it comes to be
ſuffered in a well-governed State, that
Sixty thouſand idle fellows, who have
only the name and Habit of <hi>Monks,</hi> do
live fat and in good plight at the charge
of the people, without having their
crimes puniſhed, not acknowledging
either Seccular or Eccleſiaſtical Juſtice;
and not to be ſubject to any for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement,
but only to go up and down
from one Convent to another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>The Church will never be able
to attribute to it ſelf the <hi>Elogium</hi> which
is given her of being without Spot, as
long as ſhe ſhall have ſuch <hi>Monks,</hi>
which may juſtly be termed the ſhame
of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world, the ſcandal of
Religion, and the diſhonour and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the Church. That it is very fit
their exceſſes and debauches ſhould be
known, that they ought not to be
Confeſſors, till after the age of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
years; becauſe thoſe Villains
make uſe of the Tribunals of Penance,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:30280:75"/>
to diſcover Womens and Maids diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
That there they put to them
beaſtly and unchaſt Interrogatories,
that they ſollicite them, and induce
them to ſin; ſo that Confeſſion is not
made to the ſalvation, but the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their Souls: And that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the good Paſtors, and true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors,
Confeſſing is the Pool of proof,
where after that the Angel had trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Waters, all kind of diſeaſes
were cured; now, with moſt of the
<hi>Monks,</hi> 'tis a ſtinking Lake, where
Souls are Poyſoned, and where thoſe
Devils fiſh in troubled Waters. That
it is now a ſeat of wickedneſs, and
that the Son of <hi>God</hi> receives more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
and injuries at that Tribunal,
than he received at <hi>Caiaphas</hi>'s, <hi>Pilate</hi>'s &amp;
<hi>Herod's</hi> hands. That thoſe Vagabonds
ought to be Cloyſtered up, to prevent
their running abroad; becauſe two
ſteps can ſcarce be taken in the Streets,
without meeting one <hi>Monk</hi> or other.
That ſuch Women who ſpend their
time in prating with them at the doors
of their Convents, or in their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:30280:75"/>
ought to be declared infamous;
that thoſe wretched perſons who give
up themſelves wholly to them, ought
to be cut off, and thoſe Raſcals to be
ſeverely chaſtiſed, when they are found
in a Bawdy-houſe; that they ought
not to be permitted to appear in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions,
being a ſcandal to the World,
with their Noſes full of Rubies, by
their drunkenneſs and other debauches.
That they ought to be ſhut out of
peoples doors, by reaſon that thoſe
Seducers enter, only to ſow diviſions
in Families, to corrupt Wives, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Servant-Maids. I ſay moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that as long as we have <hi>Monks,</hi>
(ſuch as they are at preſent) the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genots</hi>
will have cauſe to laugh and to
jear us, that they ought to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
happy for being free from that
Vermine; that the Hood is a neſt of
Hypocriſie, that 'tis the mouth of <hi>Hell,</hi>
the Box of <hi>Pandora,</hi> and mark of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
That the being called to a
<hi>Monaſtical</hi> ſtate, is one of the moſt
dangerous temptations which the <hi>Devil</hi>
can give a young man up to; that 'tis
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:30280:76"/>
the broad-road way to deſtruction, ſo
far is it from being a ſtate of acquired
perfection, as thoſe Raſcals affirm.
Whoſoever ſpeaks of a <hi>Monk,</hi> ſpeaks
of a Seducer of the people, a corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Feminine Sex, an Artiſt of
Impoſtures, a diſguiſed forger of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
a Sales-man of Myſteries, a

of Holy-days, a contriver of
