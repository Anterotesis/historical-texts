            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEing now after ten yeeres, returned into my native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and having opportunity, upon even ground, to spread before your face such grievances, as in former times I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you, hope that, now, you will not shut your eyes against the light, but open them to behold it without prejudice.</p>
            <p>But that the unreasonablenesse of your dealings with me may more clearely appeare, let me premise this one thing before I proceed, <hi>viz.</hi> That from first to last, more or lesse, you neuer had to object against me any thing that savoured either of error in doctrine, scandall in life, or contempt of authority, but onely this, that I could not against light of conscience obey the cruell commands of my Taskmasters, in conforming to superstitious, and nocent ceremonies. Yea, so farre was your conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of mine integrity, that not once, but often, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many witnesses (when you were come to your selfe) you gave such a testimony of me, as I judge not meet (in modesty) to expresse. Yet behold your proceedings against me, not onely to the highest point of extremity, but farre beyond all bonds of law, and justice.</p>
            <p n="1">For, 1. You silenced me from preaching.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You deprived me of my Living, and not in open Court, but in hugger, mugger, (your Register <hi>Cooke</hi> onely being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,) an act most contrary to law; as I hope, now you will be able to confesse.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You rested not here, but passed upon me the sorest censure (had it been rightly administred) that ever Jesus Christ ordained against the most notorious and scandalous persons in his Church; that dreadfull sentence of excommunication. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thrust out, first from the Pulpit, then from my living, after that, from the Church, as a man unfit either to preach, or live, or participate of the blood of Christ. Under all which burdens
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60686:3"/>
I lay down in silence, and (desiring to tread the steps of my Lord) yeelding my cheek to the Smiters, and was dumbe before my snearers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yet (as if the former rigour had been nothing) your next act exceeded all the rest; for being present, upon some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, at one of your Visitation-Courts, and not making the least question, but that, without the least offence I might be present in a publique assembly whereunto many hundreds of all sorts both good and bad resorted, it seemes, was mistaken, and not enough considerate of the eminency of your person, the holinesse of the place, and the defilednesse of my selfe, through my late censure, and therefore was taught better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. Having called me before you, and fastning your eyes upon me with disdainfull fiercenesse, you rated and reviled me with contumelious words, as an impudent man (or fellow) and asked me, how <hi>I</hi> dare being excommunicate, to approach your presence to stand upon holy ground.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You called for <hi>Tomlins,</hi> and committed me a prisoner into his hands, and after bound me to appeare in a bond of an 100. marks, with two sufficient sureties, at the next High Commission Court at <hi>Lambeth;</hi> there to answer for my contempt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency.</p>
            <p>You threatned to make me an example to all Ministers in your whole Diocesse, I entreated your favour, and pleaded for my selfe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it was not in my purpose, to give you the least offence by my presence there, and therefore besought you to conster it (at the most, but) as an errour of ignorance, far from contempt or impudency. And to prove, how loath I would have been wittingly to give you any distast, <hi>I</hi> told you that all the prayer and sermon time, before the Court began, <hi>I</hi> had stood without the Church, and came not in till all was ended, meerely for this very reason, that I might not be offensire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I praied you to consider how much <hi>I</hi> had suffered already, and intreated that that might be sufficient in your eyes, and to proceed no further against me for such a thing as this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How <hi>I</hi> had silently born all those hard censures past upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60686:3"/>
me by you, and had not gainsayed, or carried my selfe in any distastefull manner.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What testimony your selfe had born of me, concerning my former carriage; and therefore, not to let one oversight so poise you against me.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>If</hi> you nothing regarded my selfe, yet to tender the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my wife and children, who were ready to be exposed to inconveniences enough by my former sufferings without any new addition to the same. To which your answer was, That you never regarded arguments of wives and children, better they perish then you neglect that duty and charge the King hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted you withall, of keeping order in the Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. After this. D. <hi>Duck<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> your own Chancellour, who sat by, and heard all matters how they passed, stood up and interceded for me, and professed he thought <hi>I</hi> spake ingenuously. Then my Lord <hi>Maynard,</hi> who was present, of his own accord also secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his suit. And after him, divers other Gentlemen, did the like for my release. But all were flung off, and denied, with such an incontrouleable stifnesse, that all the beholders stood amazed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Last of all my selfe, finding an opportunity after you had dined. thinking then to find you in a calmer temper, began to renue my request; but as <hi>I</hi> was making entrance into my suit, in great rage you cut me off, and said; Trouble not your selfe, nor me, any further, for let all the friends you have in <hi>England</hi> doe their best, <hi>I</hi> am resolved not to alter my resolution one haires bredth.</p>
            <p>So after all meanes used to no purpose, <hi>I</hi> was left a prisoner in my keepers hands, and after that, driven to put in bond for my appearance.</p>
            <p>Then considering with my selfe, your displeasure how much, your power how great, and my selfe how unable to resist, and (that were my cause never so good) <hi>I</hi> knew how <hi>I</hi> was like to speed, if it were for nothing but for refusing that oath; <hi>I</hi> was driven (by your terrour) to fly my deare native Country, forsake my loving friends, and leave many outward comforts in this life, and venter my life, and the lives of my deare wife, and tender children, upon the face of the deepes, choosing rather to live amongst wild beasts, and wild men in a wildernesse, under the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60686:4"/>
blessing of Heaven, then under the power of such unreasonable men here. (Though God hath been pleased to make that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse a fruitfull field, and a very corner of Heaven unto us, but that was no thanke to you.) Yet your selfe not being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with all this sorrow, trouble, and losse you had put me upon, even, (after you had taken away my means of livelihood) made me pay the forfeiture of my bond, and fined me 20. 40. 50. pound a day for <hi>non</hi>-appearance, and then sent your Pursevants down to my house to seise upon all my goods I left there.</p>
            <p>Now I beseech you, in the spirit of meeknesse, consider</p>
            <p n="1">1. The greatnesse and multiplicity of my sufferings you inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on me, most of them (if not all) without law, reason, or mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The smalnesse (if any at all) of mine offence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The innocency of my person, by your own confession, and your chancellors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The implacablenesse of your spirit incensed without ground or measure.</p>
            <p>All which particulars, here set down, (you know) I can make sound and undeniable proofe of: and so I leave all upon your spirit to weigh and consider, and to give me a rationall answer unto, as in the sight of God, who will shortly be our judge.</p>
            <p>And, now <hi>I</hi> beseech the God and father of all light and grace, to open your eyes to see the exceeding depth of those, and all your other sins; and that God, that smote and clave the Rocks in the wildernesse, smite your heart with sound conviction and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for all the evill you have done to Christ himselfe, whose sides and heart you have goared; to many of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers whose mouthes you have stopped, and to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of his Saints whose hearts you have grieved, and bodies imprisoned, all whose teares are in his bottle; and also to <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60686:4"/>
bleed afresh to all eternity. And if your repentance prove true it will shew it selfe (<hi>Zacheus</hi> like) by restitution to all that you have wronged, as far as your estate will reach, you will cover or fill up the pits you have digged in mens estates according to <hi>Moses</hi> law. <hi>Non remittatur peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum.</hi>
