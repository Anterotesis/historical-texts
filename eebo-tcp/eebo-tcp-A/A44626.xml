            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Memorial delivered to his Majesty by the Honourable Edward Howard and
Bernard Howard of Norfolk, <date>the 16th. day of November 1676.</date> of what
they demand from their Brother the Right Honourable Henry Earl Marshal of
England; wiih the Grounds and Reasons of and for their said Demands.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Their Demands are Three.</head>
               <p>1. THat his said Lordship will please, pursuant to his own free offer and promise,
waive all Acts by them respectively done, by which they may in strictness be
barred of the Provisions intended them by their late Father, out of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus
of such Lands as were appointed to be sold for the payment of Debts;
and of the Provisions intended them out of such Lands, whereof the now Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
levied a Fine <hi>Sur concessit;</hi> to be subject to such Trusts as their said Father should direct;
and come to a just Accompt with them for the several benefits which ought to accrue to
them, upon the said respective Provisions; in case no Acts had been done by them, to bar
them of such benefits. The said Accompt to be taken by Referrees to be appointed by an
Order of a Court of Equity, and they to be armed with a Commission to examine upon
Oath, and they to settle all the said Accompts, and their determination to pass into a Decree,
so as to oblige a satisfaction of what shall appear due upon such Accompt.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Or if his Lordship shall refuse this, Then</head>
               <p>That his Lordship will please to let them have those respective allowances of 200 <hi>l. per
annum</hi> apiece, which his Lordship formerly allowed them for Diet and Lodgings; the
arrears thereof to be immediately paid; and the growing allowances, together with such
Rents-charge as have formerly been granted to them out of the Manor of <hi>Rotherham,</hi> to be
secured as their Councel shall think safe; so that they may have better securities for the
same then bare Distresses; and may have Lands unincumbred to enter upon and hold, in
case what shall be due be not paid: And all arrears of those Rents-charge to be forthwith
satisfied, together with the charges occasioned by their being enforced to distrein for
the same.</p>
               <p>2. That those future expectant Interests, which their said late Father intended for them
out of his Estates in the Counties of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmerland,</hi> may be so re-settled as
that they may not for the future be barred, but may be secured to come unto them,
according to the intentions of their said Father: So that they may not be compelled to
trouble a Parliament to relieve them in this particular.</p>
               <p>3. That they, and their Sister the Lady <hi>Eliz. Mac Donnel,</hi> (without whose consent they
cannot agree this particular point) may have a just and full discovery and accompt of their
Grandmothers Cabinet, and all things therewith delivered unto his Lordship by their
Uncle the Lord Viscount <hi>Stafford,</hi> in Trust for all the Children of their said late Father,
(except their Brother <hi>Charles;</hi>) and that they may each of them have their just shares of
the same <hi>in specie;</hi> or else that they and their said Sister may each of them have the sum of
1000 <hi>l.</hi> for such their several share, with Interest for the said monies from the time of the
delivery of the said Cabinet, and what was so delivered.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Grounds and Reasons of and for the first before mentioned Demand.</head>
               <p>1. There were Provisions designed as a present maintenance for the said <hi>Edward</hi> and
<hi>Bernard,</hi> and for some other of their Brothers, by their said late Father: The first was
made by their said Father himself, out of the overplus of a very great Estate in Lands
settled in Trustees for the payment of Debts: Upon this there was due to each of them
from the Lord Marshal 3000 <hi>l.</hi> to be paid at the time the said overplus was conveyed to his
said Lordship, which was in <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1659. For which they are to have Interest from
that time, or else each of them to have one Twelfth part of the Inheritance <hi>in specie</hi> of
the said whole overplus, with satisfaction to each of them for the Rents and Profits of
such respective Twelfth part from the year 1659. The other Provision was made by the
now Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> by the procurement of their said Father, who prevailed with the
said Duke to levie a Fine <hi>Sur concessit,</hi> for the vesting a very great Estate in Lands in
Trustees for the life of the said Duke, to be subject to such Trusts as their said Father should
direct. Upon this Trust there ought to have been due to each of them at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1674.
above 12000 <hi>l.</hi> and from that time during the life of the said Duke above 600 <hi>l. per annum.</hi>
And of this last Provision they had no particular knowledge until very lately. Yet he did
afterwards in the presence of the Right Honourable the Lord Privy Seal, and others, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
and promise, That if they were not fully satisfied, that the said Rents of 300 <hi>l.</hi> apiece
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103976:2"/>
by him granted to them, were a full satisfaction in value for all that was or could be due
unto them upon the said Provisions so by them sold, conveyed or released, (as he affirmed)
he would waive all Acts done by them, which might bar them of any of the said Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and come to a just and strict accompt with them in relation to the said Provisions:
And that if upon such accompt it should appear, that there was or could be more due unto
them then 2100 <hi>l.</hi> apiece, (which was the price for which the said Rents had been granted)
he would make them a full satisfaction for what upon such Accompt should appear to be
yet due unto them. This they then believed he would have done; but they since find,
that his Lordship is otherwise resolved; and he hath fully made it appear, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his said promise, he is now resolved to take the full benefit of the Bargains which
he affirmeth he hath gained from them for 2100 <hi>l.</hi> apiece.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Grounds and Reasons of and for the second before mentioned Demand.</head>
               <p>2. Their said late Father taking it for certain, that the two Provisions before mentioned
would, during the life of the said Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> be a reasonable maintenance for those
for whom he intended the same, was pleased by another Settlement (which was of his
whole Estate in the Counties of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmerland</hi>) to design another Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for the said <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> and two other of their Brothers, as an Estate-Tail
for the benefit of them and their Children; to take effect after the descending of the
Dignity of Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> upon the Lord Marshal, or (which Mr. <hi>Marriot</hi> his Lordships
Agent affirms to have been the true intentions of their said late Father) upon any of his
Issue. This Settlement was so drawn, as that the said future Estates were to come to the
said <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> and the said other two Brothers, only in case the said Dignity
should personally descend and come to the said Lord Marshal. But this was not the sole
fault in the penning of it: For notwithstanding it was the intent of their said Father, that
it should never be in the power of any to bar the said future Provisions; yet the same
was so drawn, that the Lord Marshal hath absolutely destroyed and barred all those future
Estates, so that the same can never be revived but by his said Lordships own Act, if that can
do it, or by an Act of Parliament for that purpose.</p>
               <p>All the satisfaction which hath been given for these respective Provisions hath been,
That the said <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> as each of them came to the age of 21 years, were
told by the Lord Marshal of the said first Provision particularly; and that the Debts to be
paid were so great, that the overplus would not amount to near 2000 <hi>l.</hi> apiece to them.
But that his Lordship would nevertheless give unto each of them a Rent-charge for life of
300 <hi>l. per annum</hi> apiece, which he valued at 2100 <hi>l.</hi> apiece. And having Draughts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
and ready Engrossed for that purpose by his own Councel, they accepted, and he
executed the Deeds accordingly; by which neither of them have any other remedy for
their said Rents, but barely a Distress upon Lands; so that for every half-years Rent due
and unpaid, they must be driven to a chargeable Suit (which is their present case) to
recover every half-years Rent. And his Lordship was then likewise pleased to promise,
to allow unto each of them Diet and Lodgings, and other advantages and conveniences,
which he did allow for some years in kind; and afterwards for some few years he allowed
unto each of them 200 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> in lieu of those conveniences: But this is now, and
hath been for some time stopt.</p>
               <p>As touching the said second Provision, which they expresly aver, (and are ready to affirm
upon Oath) That they did not know any thing in particular of the same when their said
Rents were granted, nor until very lately. They did lately address to the said Lord
Marshal, and prayed to have the benefit of the same for the future; and an accompt and
satisfaction for what was due for the same for the time past: Representing that they had
never received more upon any accompt of any Provisions made for them out of the Estate
of their Family, then as is before mentioned. To which his Lordship answered, that he
did own they had no other satisfaction then as aforesaid: But declared, that the respective
satisfactions of the 300 <hi>l.</hi> Rents-charge, which he had granted to each of them, and which
he valued at 2100 <hi>l.</hi> apiece, was in reality of more value then what could any ways come
to them by both the aforesaid Provisions; Averring, that for the said Rents of 300 <hi>l.</hi> apiece
they had each of them sold, Conveyed, or Released to him, or others in Trust for him,
both the said Provisions, and all that was or could be due upon the same; and had by their
own Acts barred themselves from demanding any thing farther.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Grounds and Reasons of and for the said third and last before
mentioned Demand.</head>
               <p>3. Upon the death of their Grandmother, there was a Cabinet of Jewels and Rarities to
the value of above 30000 <hi>l.</hi> part of the Estate of their said Grandmother, put into the hands
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103976:2"/>
of the Lord Marshal by their Uncle the Lord Viscount <hi>Stafford,</hi> for the use of the said Lord
Marshal, and all the Children of their Father, (except their Brother <hi>Charles</hi>) and to be
as their share of their said Grandmothers personal Estate. The reason why their Brother
<hi>Charles</hi> was to have no share therein being, that their said Uncle had given him 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in
monies, which he had accepted as his share of the said personal Estate. For this they have
never as yet received any satisfaction.</p>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div type="answer">
            <head>The Answer of the Earl Marshal, put in <date>January the 9th, 1676.</date> to a Memorial
delivered to his Majesty, by his Brothers Mr. Edward and Mr. Bernard
Howard, touching their Demands from his Lordship.</head>
            <div type="demands">
               <head>The Demands being Three,</head>
               <p>TO the first his Lordship saith, That he never offered or promised to waive all Acts by
them respectively done, and to come to an Accompt with them for the several bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
which ought to accrue to them, upon the respective Provisions made for them, and by
them released and assigned, mentioned in this Demand; nor was there any ground or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for the same, there being no Reference or meeting at any time touching these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
or any Demand made till they lately exhibited their Bill in the Exchequer, to avoid
their own Agreements: Which upon his Lordships Answer and Plea, they thought fit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to dismiss with Costs: Yet its above 14 years since that the last Agreement was
made with the youngest of them. But (as in his Lordships Answer to the same Suggestion
in their Bill aforesaid) he saith, That if an Accompt could be easily stated, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsible
and obliged to answer what should be due thereupon, it would prove many
Thousands of pounds for his Lordships advantage. But his Lordship (for the reasons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said)
neither did or doth think fit to put himself to the trouble thereof, only to gratifie
them who have so ill deserved it. And his Lordship doth aver, That (at the making of the
said Agreement) he did give to them, as he did to other his Brothers, double the yearly
values of what they could pretend to, eitheir by their Fathers Will, or upon the Trust of
the Fine <hi>Sur concessit;</hi> which latter being but during the life of the Duke, the Brother of
the said Earl, he made the aforesaid Provision absolutely to them during their respective
lives, to the end that after the death of the Duke they might not want a subsistency. And
herewith they were so well satisfied, that some time after the said Agreement made and
executed, they gave it under their respective hands and seals, (reciting what they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased
and assigned to his Lordship, and what he had granted to them in lieu thereof) that
by the said Agreement they were much obliged and advantaged, and gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the same, contrary to all which they offer to swear in their Memorial.</p>
               <p>But now if his Lordship will continue to them respectively 200 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> which he
sometime formerly out of bounty helped them to, they will be satisfied to waive the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
matter of Accompt: So that it's plain, how this first Demand is only made use of to
obtain the latter, which his Lordship can no ways gratifie them in, but by justifying them in
their proceedings and Demands, and the accusing of himself by the rewarding of them for
their so great and false clamours, scandals and proceedings still renewed in the Courts of
Judicature against him, and obstructing the peace and quiet of his Lordship and their
Family.</p>
               <p>And for the better securing the payment of the Rents-charge, his Lordship is advised,
That the same is granted to them as all Rents-charge are usually made; and doth averr the
Estate is more then sufficient value, and not incumbred, as they by their Bill and in this
Paper suggest: And till these late disturbances were raised by them, they were punctually
paid the same, as by their respective Acquittances will appear. And notwithstanding their
ill carriage towards his Lordship, there is but half a years Rent-charge at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> last
due to the elder, and 160 <hi>l.</hi> to the other, which his Lordship was and is ready to pay, they
giving such Acquittances for the same as Councel shall reasonably advise.</p>
               <p>To the second his Lordship saith, That as to that contingent Estate or Interest they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively
claim in the Barony of <hi>Burgh</hi> in <hi>Cumberland, viz.</hi> each of them a Third part, to
take effect in case the Dignity of Earl <hi>Arundel</hi> should descend upon his Lordship: For what
Acts he hath done to the destruction of that contingent Interest they pretend to, he was
necessitated thereto for the establishing an Agreement with the Tenants, and therein had
the advice of learned Councel; and hath done no more then every Tenant in Tail doth by
levying a Fine to dock the same, and what in Law and Equity is warranted. But until the
Dignity of the said Earldom descends upon his Lordship, they have no colour or pretence
to that Estate. And if herein they conceive themselves injured, he freely leaves them to take
such legal and equitable ways and means as they shall be advised, for recovery of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
right.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103976:3"/>To the third and last Demand his Lordship saith, That by no Agreement made by his
Lordship with the Lord Viscount <hi>Stafford,</hi> he is any ways obliged to render an accompt or
share of the Cabinet mentioned, as they would have found, had they not suddenly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
their Bill which they exhibited in the Exchequer. But since they having joyned in
another Bill with Mr. <hi>Mac Donnel,</hi> to the same and other purpose, they shall in due time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
such Answer or Plea thereto, as his Lordship shall be advised. And therefore hopes
no further Answer can be now desired, they having joyned with Mr. <hi>Mac Donnel,</hi> with
whom his Lordship long since and yet might have an end, but that Mr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who hath
no joynt Interest with Mr. <hi>Mac Donnel,</hi> hath conjoyned himself with him in the Suit: For
which in due time Mr. <hi>Mac Donnel</hi> will find how great cause he hath had to complain of
Mr. <hi>Bernard Howard,</hi> and none at all of his Lordship, who for the present desires to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
from opening himself, as to what he must stand upon with Mr. <hi>Mac Donnel;</hi> and the
rather, because things said in confidence upon former meetings, have been discovered and
ill use made of, to continue and not end these differences. Wherefore his Lordship humbly
desires, That his Majesty will be pleased to believe, that Mr. <hi>Mac Donnel,</hi> who hath given
no Releases, will not be able to get so great advantage as the rest have done, until it appear
otherwise to his Majesty, by the Judgment of the Court. And then, though his Lordship
will never depart from the Releases which he hath so dearly bought of these Brothers, his
Majesty will clearly see, that there was no cause for either of them to complain of these
Releases.</p>
               <p>And by this time his Majesty cannot but see, how much these Brothers stand obliged in
Honour and Conscience, to retract in all places those unjust imputations and scandals, which
they have taken pains to throw upon his Lordship, which are a very ungratefull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
return for the kindnesses shewed to them, more particularly then to the rest of his
Brothers. Thus having fully answered as to the respective Demands, the Reasons which
they give for the same being weak, untrue, and contradictory in themselves, his Lordship
conceives not worth any further Answer.</p>

            <head>The Reply of the Honourable Edward and Bernard Howard of Norfolk, to the

            <div type="reply">
               <head>Their Reply to the whole Answer in general.</head>
               <p>AS to the said Answer in general, amounting to no more then, 1. A flat denial of the
Truth of a matter of Fact which hath been already proved before his Majesty.
2. A flat denial of the Truth of another matter, which they doubt not but to prove before
his Majesty, by the testimony of his and their Uncle the Right Honourable the Lord
Viscount <hi>Stafford,</hi> if they may be admitted to make such proof, and that his Majesty will
please to send for the said Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> to attend him at a day to be for that purpose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
3. A flat denial of all the Demands contained in the said Memorial. And 4. Many
undecent expressions, and much ill language bestowed upon the said <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi>
unfit (as they humbly conceive) to be used towards any Gentlemen, much more unfit to be
used towards his Lordship's Brothers, but most of all unfit to be in writing under his hand
in a Paper delivered to his Majesty, and wholly omitting to take notice of the respective
Reasons by them given in their said Memorial, for their Demands therein contained. They
humbly say, by way of general Reply, That their Memorial was delivered by them upon
his Majesties particular command for that purpose: To which they humbly conceive his
Majesty was induced, by an opinion which he had of the great Honour and Integrity of,
and of the Interest which his Majesty supposed he had in his Lordship; his Majesty was
perswaded, that his Lordship would not deny any truth: And that if upon the whole
matter, his Majesty should think fit to desire his Lordship to comply with any reasonable
thing, which should be demanded in the said Memorial, his Lordship would not fail to do
the same, without putting the Demandants to seek or prosecute any farther, either in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
or in any Court of Equity, for a Relief. This being the original motive which
occasioned the delivering in of their said Memorial, they shall humbly expect the issue of
it, after his Majesty shall have considered of their said Demands, and the Reasons upon
which the same are grounded, together with the said Answer; and what is here farther
replyed to all the several particulars thereof, excepting only what relates to the several
undecent expressions, and ill language therein contained; to which out of respect to his
Majesty, and also out of tenderness to his Lordship, they forbear to reply any thing.</p>

               <head>Their Reply in particular to the Particulars of the said Answer.</head>
               <head type="sub">As to the Answer to the first part of the first Demand, they say,</head>
               <p>1. As to the truth of the matter of Fact, whether his Lordship did, or did not make such
promise as is charged in the said first Demand, which the Demandants affirm, and his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
denies in this Answer, and did also upon the Sacrament of his Honour positively deny,
in his Answer to their Bill exhibited against him in his Majesties Court of Exchequer;
These Demandants say, that they affirm, as they have affirmed in their said first Demand,
that his Lordship did make such promise as is affirmed in their said first Demand; and that
the Right Honourable the Lord Privy Seal hath already personally testified unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
that the said Lord Marshal did make such promise; and they are likewise ready, for
his Majesties farther satisfaction therein, if required by his Majesty, to produce farther proof
of this matter of Fact. And they humbly pray, that the proof of this Fact may be admitted
and taken by his Majesty, as a just measure of the truth of such other matters as are affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by them in their said Memorial, and denied by his said Lordship in his Answer. 2. As
to their Bill exhibited against his Lordship in the Exchequer, and the dismission of the same
with Costs upon his Lordships Plea, they say, That true it is, they did exhibit a Bill in the
Exchequer against his Lordship, to have a performance of his said promise in the said first
Demand mentioned; believing that his Lordship would not have denied, but rather that
he would have owned and made good his said promise; and that he would according to
his promise, have come to an Accompt with them, waiving all Acts done by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively,
which might bar them from demanding such Accompt: But when they found
by his Lordships pleading several Acts done by them, that he would not perform his said
promise, they then upon their own motion had their said Bill dismissed, with ordinary Costs
of Court in such cases, <hi>(viz. 20 s.)</hi> 3. As to the Reasons given by his Lordship for not
coming to an Accompt as demanded, namely, That the Demandants are not responsible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nor obliged to answer what shall be found due from them upon such Accompt, settled as
demanded: In case any thing shall be found so due, and that it will require much trouble
to state the Accompts demanded, they say, That if his Lordship will be so just to his said
promise, as to come to an Accompt as desired, they are willing that it shall be part of the
Order of Reference, by which such Accompt shall be referred to be taken by Referrees,
that his Lordship on his part, and the Demandants on their part, shall give good Security,
such as the Court which shall make the said Order shall approve, to answer what shall be
found due to the other, upon such Accompt settled; and they desire to leave it to such
Accompt, to determine whether they have received to the value of what was of right due
to them. And they are so far from being conscious, that their Proposal of making Oath
unto what they offered in their said Memorial to confirm by Oath, was a rash or inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Proposal, that they still offer to do the same, if his Majesty shall think it necessary.
And if his Lordship shall please to produce unto his Majesty, the Instrument of Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
which he in his Answer glories in, to be perused and considered of by some of
his Majesties learned Councel, the Demandants are very confident, that the vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
clauses in it, will prevail with his Majesties said Councel to believe, that if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandants
did execute the same, and shall make Oath that they did not advise with Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
touching the same, and that they did not read the same before they executed the same,
the said Councel, as well as his Majesty, will believe both parts of such Oath to be true.
And as to the advantage pretended by his Lordship to be given to the Demandants, in
granting to each of them a Rent-charge of 300 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> for their respective lives, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
only by Distress; which is a Suit for every half-years Rent, and may be stopped
by Priviledge of Parliament, as often as a Parliament shall be sitting; and this for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of 3000 <hi>l.</hi> due to each of them from his Lordship before the said Rent-charge
granted; and also for the purchase of their respective Interests in the Twelfth part of the
Rents and Profits of an Estate for the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s life, worth about 700 <hi>l.</hi> or 800 <hi>l.
per annum;</hi> which respective Twelfth parts was not to determine by the respective deaths
of the Demandants, as they have been often told, but on the contrary, they find by the
Deeds it was to accrue to their respective Executors or Assigns, during the life of the said
Duke. Whoever shall consider the said transaction, will find that there was a considerable
advantage gained by his Lordships granting of the said Rents: But they will see, that the
advantage was so great on his Lordships part, that if his Lordship had granted to each of
the Demandants 600 <hi>l. per annum</hi> Lands of Inheritance, for what he then prevailed with
them to depart with, he had been a considerable gainer by the bargain, as his Lordship
hath managed the affair. As they doubt not but the same would appear, upon the settling
of the Accompt by them demanded, if his Lordships Honour would be prevailed with to
come to such Accompt. Which Accompt these Demandants say is so far from requiring
any trouble from his Lordship, (unless he esteems it a trouble to do them right, which is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103976:4"/>
a very great trouble to them to find) that to secure his Lordship from all apprehensions of
that nature, they will be willing to admit the Charge in relation to the Rents of the Lands
in the Fine <hi>Sur concessit,</hi> and the Fines raised by Leases upon those Lands, to be as they
were charged by his Lordship's Agent, upon the late Reference between his Lordship and
Mr. <hi>Mac Donnel,</hi> (the Demandants Brother-in-Law;) in which the Lord Privy Seal, and
the Lord Viscount <hi>Hallifax,</hi> were two of the Referrees: So that there needs no more
trouble, then to add to the said Charge the value of the Timber felled upon those Lands,
and the accompt of the Rents and Profits of those Lands, and Fines raised by Leases since
the time for which that accompt was given, and to leave all those, with the Discharges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
upon that accompt, (which are all ready drawn up and written) to the Judgment
of such Referrees as shall be appointed, pursuant to the said first Demand.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="reply">
               <head>As to the Answer to the second part of the first Demand, they say,</head>
               <p>1. As to that of the first Demand which concerns those respective allowances of 200 <hi>l.
per annum</hi> apiece, which his Lordship formerly allowed them for Diet and Lodgings, and
the Arrears thereof, the reason of that Demand stands thus: His Lordship was pleased
several times, after the death of their Father, to tell them, that he had promised their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to be a Father to them after their Father's death; And as often as his Lordship ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
this, it was his custom to averr, that he would religiously perform such his
promise made unto their Father: And as a testimony of such performance, his Lordship did
for some time allow unto them Diet and Lodgings for them and their Servants in <hi>Arundel</hi>
house. After the allowance for some time of those conveniences, his Lordship having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to go beyond the Seas, and give over House-keeping, declared that he would allow
unto each of them 200 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> in lieu of those conveniences; and for some time
did so. Having this promise, they esteemed those allowances secure, and the rather for that
his Lordship being long since desired by his Majehy, to secure unto the said <hi>Bernard</hi> the
aforesaid allowance by some Land-security, his Lordship was pleased to give unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
so great a reason to believe that he would do so, that his Majesty relying thereupon,
hath several times pleased to tell the said <hi>Bernard,</hi> that his Majesty would be Garranty for
his Lordships paying the arrears of the said allowance, and for securing the growing pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the same allowance upon Land-security, for the life of the said <hi>Bernard.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandants
being to deliver in a Paper into the hands of his Majesty, of what they had to
demand from his Lordship; and finding that his Lordship had solemnly denied in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to their Bill, that Promise which he made touching his coming to an Accompt, as is
desired in the first part of this Demand, esteemed it advisable to demand the continuance
and securing of their aforesaid Allowances, to the end his Majesty might see whether his
Lordship would perform any thing. This was the reason of this part of their Demand,
which they will not only freely quit, (if his Lordship will satisfie the first part of this first
Demand) but they will also each of them be obliged to present his Lordship with 500 <hi>l.</hi>
upon his Lordships satisfying the said first part of this first Demand, and paying unto them
what upon such Accompt as is there demanded, shall be found due to them respectively.
And by this they hope that second part of their said first Demand, stands justified from the
construction put upon it by his Lordship. And as to the better securing of the Rents to
which they are at present entituled, they insist as in their said first Demand, to have better
security for the same then bare Distresses; and that they may have not only their arrears
of their said respective Rents, but also the charges by them respectively expended in taking
such Distresses as they were compelled to take, for the recovery of the said arrears, from
the time his Lordship ordered his Receiver to forbear the payment of the said Rents. As to
the ill language and undecent expressions, which close up the Answer to the said first De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
they reply nothing, but leave the consideration thereof to his Majesty.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="reply">
               <head>As to the Answer to the second Demand, they say,</head>
               <p>That it containing no more then a flat denial of the Demand, which craved relief in a
case wherein they can have no relief, in the present circumstances, (in which they hear
(from his Lordship's Agent Mr. <hi>Marriot</hi>) he hath put the Estate mentioned, by settling
the same upon his Lordship's Issue by a second Venter) but by his Lordship's free Act, or
by an Act of Parliament; They conceive, for the reasons mentioned in their Memorial, in
relation to that Demand, (of which reasons his Lordship is pleased to take no notice)
his Majesty will think it fitting to prevail with his Lordship, to comply with the said second
Demand; the case being (as these Demandants are advised) a case of a meer Trust, and
far differing from the cases of Common Entails; as they conceive will appear by their
Reasons contained in their Memorial relating to the same, and unto which they refer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this particular.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="reply">
               <head>As to the Answer to the third Demand, they say,</head>
               <p>1. As to so much thereof as contains a flat denial of a meer matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Agreement made with the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> they refer themselves to the first part of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103976:4"/>
their Reply to the said Answer. 2. As to what is charged on the Demandants, or either
of them, touching their joyning in a Bill with their Brother <hi>Mac Donnel,</hi> and the Lady
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, their Sister, and touching their having no joynt Interest with them;
These Demandants and each of them for Reply say, that their joyning in the said Bill, for
so much as they did joyn, <hi>viz.</hi> to pray an accompt of the Cabinet mentioned in the said
third Demand, was for the saving of expences, and because in that particular their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
are so joyned, that if these Demandants had not been in that point joyned as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants
with them, they must have made them Defendants, or have given his Lordship
a cause of demurring against their Bill, as these Demandants were and are advised by their
Councel. 3. As to what is charged against one of the Demandants, touching the said
Mr. <hi>Mac Donnel</hi>'s having more cause to complain against the said Demandant, then against
his Lordship; It is replyed, by referring to the Printed Case of the said Mr. <hi>Mac Donnel</hi>
hereunto annexed, not long since presented by the said Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to his Majesty;
(purporting the causes which the said Mr. <hi>Mac Donnel</hi> and the said Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> then
had, and (as is believed) still have to complain against his Lordship.) And until his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
can name and prove any one Act done by these Demandants, or either of them, to
the oppression of the said Mr. <hi>Mac Donnel</hi> and his said Wife, or either of them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
his Lordship, for his own sake, to forbear such Charges, since they can serve for no
other end then to give occasion to others to inquire into, and then make discoveries of his
Lordship's actions; which whether it will be of any advantage to his Lordship, is referred
unto his Lordship's better Judgment.</p>
               <p>As to the close of the said Answer, they say, That they are not conscious to themselves
of having reported or affirmed any thing of his Lordship, in any place, or at any time,
which was against Justice or Truth, and which they were not compelled to say in Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of their own Honour, where endeavours had been made to weaken their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to disable them to have Credit in the world, after his Lordship had stopped the
payment of their Rents: But in case his Lordship can charge and prove, (which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect)
that they or either of them, have in any place reported or said any thing in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his Lordship, which they do not prove to be true, the party or parties offending
will own the fault, and submit to any due punishment for the same. And having offered
this, they must expect it as a Justice from his Lordship, to charge and prove something in
particular against them of this nature; or else that his Lordship will ask his Majesty par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
for having charged them to his Majesty under his Lordship's hand, so injuriously
without cause.</p>
               <p>For a close of all they humbly hope, That upon an exact consideration of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and his Lordship's Answer thereunto, together with their Reply, it is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
First, That the Accompt promised and insisted for, is not only possible, but easie to
be made. 2. That his Lordship believes so himself, else he would never perswade his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to believe, that he hath those great advantages against his Sister, by her being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
still in the Sea of that Accompt, by not having given his Lordship Releases upon the
said Accompt, as his Brothers have done. 3. His Lordship's reasoning seems very myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and intricate, by which he would perswade his Majesty and the world, that he hath
done his Brothers a great kindness in bringing them under Releases, and keeping them
strictly to it; when at the same time he pretends he hath gained so great an advantage of
his Sister, and done himself so great kindness, by not accepting a Release from his Sister,
who was upon the same account with the rest of her Brothers in all points, (except the
<hi>Cumberland</hi> Estate.) And his Lordship seems to be happy in his Councel, and wise manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole affair, if things are brought to that pass, that if whether there be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leases
or no Releases in the case, his Lordship hath still the disposal of the whole Interest,
settled by the Ancestor for the younger Children, and may yet after all the Parents cares,
give them Bread, or a Stone, at his pleasure: But better is hoped and expected from the
Grace and Justice of so good and gracious a Prince as we are happy in living under.</p>

accepted of the said Trusts, but nevertheless left the management of the said Trusts to the
said Earl Marshal; and being likewise entituled to an eighth part of a certain Cabinet, with
the Jewels and Rarities belonging to the same, the whole being of the value of above

30000 <hi>l.</hi> parcel of the Estate of her late Grandfather and Mother, and delivered into the
hands of the said Earl Marshal, to the intent the said Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should have such part
thereof as aforesaid, they the said <hi>Alexander</hi> and Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did address to the said
Earl Marshal for an accompt and satisfaction, in relation to all the said respective particulars;
and the same being refused, they exhibited their Bill in the high Court of Chancery, against
the said Earl Marshal and others: whereupon the said Earl Marshal declaring, that he desired
to have all the said Matters settled amicably without expences, by Arbitrators to be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
chosen to examine all accompts and other things relating thereunto, the said <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
and Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did accordingly consent to submit all the said matters to be
determined; and Referrees being thereupon chosen on both sides, the said Referrees began in
the first place to examine the accompts in relation to the said Lands and Estate, of which
the said Duke had levyed the said Fine; and although there was no other accompts seen or
produced, but what the Lord Marshal pleased to direct his Agents to produce, in order to
the charging of himself; and no liberty given to take any Copies of any Rentals, in order
to examine whether the Rentals which his Lordship accompted were true: the said <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
giving reasons why he suspected the truth of them, and the Referrees desiring that the
said <hi>Alexander</hi> might have Copies of the same at his own charges; and although it appears

of about 100 <hi>l. per annum</hi> during the life of the said Duke, for which his Lordship would
not accompt, yet by his Lordships own shewing; his Lordship was upon that single Trust to
accompt unto the said Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for the twelfth part of 164331 <hi>l. 2 s. 6 d. 1/2.</hi> due unto
her by that Trust only, besides her Interest in the first Provision before mentioned and her
share of the said Cabinet, but the said Reference taking no effect as to the determining of
all or any of the said matters, submitted, the said <hi>Alexander</hi> and Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were this
present <hi>Michaelmas Term</hi> compelled to endeavour again to be relieved by a Court of Equity,
and must be compelled also at the next sitting of the Parliament, to apply to Parliament to
be relieved against the said private Act, unless his Lordship will otherwise please to satisfie
their just Demands, and thereby prevent the proving the great oppressions under which the
said <hi>Alexander</hi> and Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> suffer, from his Lordships detaining their just right from
them. Thath which is Demanded by the said <hi>Alexander</hi> and Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in order to

2 s. 6 d. 1/2,</hi> with which by his own Accompts the said Trusts of the said Lands, of which
the said Fine <hi>Sur concessit</hi> was levied, stands charged, as his Lordship shall himself own to
be due unto the said Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> leaving the rest to be determined as hereafter is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
and the said <hi>Alexander Mac Donnel</hi> and Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to give a Discharge for
so much as shall so be paid.</p>
            <p>2. That the said Earl do pay, and continue to pay yearly, until the matters in difference
be determined as hereafter is proposed, such yearly sum out of the growing Rents of the
said Lands comprised in the said Fine, as his Lordship shall himself own to be due unto the
said Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> leaving the rest to such determinations as hereafter offered; and the
