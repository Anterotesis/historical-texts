            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Sober and Seaſonable Vindication, OF THE MODEST PRESBYTERY.</head>
            <p>WHen by the providence of God in the Year 1640. the late Unfortunate KING, by the ſerious Advice of his graveſt Counſellors for a Remedy to the then menacing Grievances of the People, had the Third of <hi>November</hi> called a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and therein given from the Crown many precious Jewels <hi>voluntarily,</hi> (not to be retorted from his Anceſtors by a continued ſeries and concatenation or Bloud and Treaſure expended in a long and tedious War, (the Name whereof yet too freſhly bleeds in the late renewed diſtractions;) yet ſuch was the rage of the then regnant <hi>Party,</hi> that under pretence of a diſagreeing humour, not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately jumping with their Fancy, there began a deficiency in the <hi>Main</hi> under which the Nation for a long time laboured; and after many ſtrong convulſions and griping pains was delivered of a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Treaty,</hi> the then only thought conducing means to <hi>Reſettle</hi> the diſturbed Nation,) and herein indeed were included the Major part of the Parliament, whoſe original aims never tended any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to <hi>Reform</hi> the Abuſes of the then preſent Power, not an <hi>Extirpation</hi> either of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor much leſs Government.</p>
            <p>We need not run to Antiquity to maintain this Point, that moſt worthy and learned Gentleman Mr. <hi>Pryune</hi> hath ſo cleared the way, that he hath left nothing for a poor gleaner; however in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Truth, and as a poor Imitator of his Vertues, give me leave to Inform the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>That when the burden of <hi>Diſſention</hi> (by its too frequent deciſſion in the Field) had made the people <hi>pant</hi> for want of breath, that they were even ready to fall groveling in the duſt, then as a <hi>Moſes in the Gap</hi> did the far <hi>Major part of the Commons Houſe,</hi> joyned with <hi>the then ſitting Lords,</hi> conclude themſelves within the reaſonable limit of <hi>amending</hi> abuſes, not <hi>ingroſſing</hi> the <hi>publike</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venews of the Nation into <hi>private</hi> and ſingle hands. But although the unwearied endeavours of ſome ambitious Heads, wrought effects even beyond expectation, as to an <hi>Oligarchical Democracy;</hi> yet the unceſſant labours of the honeſt and modeſt Presbyter could never be beaten off, but even when the <hi>ſword</hi> it ſelf with an <hi>uſurped Majeſty</hi> cut the <hi>Gordian</hi> knot of their Rule, they yet kept their heart; and notwithſtanding the <hi>decollation</hi> of the Head, maintained that ancient Maxim of <hi>Cor'ultimum moriens;</hi> for indeed had <hi>they</hi> not been all heart, the whole from thence could never have received a new ſtrength and vigor.</p>
            <p>To <hi>theſe</hi> therefore all Free-born <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> owe their Liberties, <hi>Magna Charta</hi> had died if the <hi>Members ſecluded</hi> in 1648. had not ſurvived, the <hi>Law</hi> had ceaſed, and every man might have done what ſeemed good in his own eyes, as when there was <hi>no King in Iſrael;</hi> or as at the time when the <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> domineered in <hi>England,</hi> whoſe constitutions uſed only to the calm of a <hi>Southern Brize,</hi> was not able to endure the ſtorm of a cold <hi>Northern</hi> blaſt.</p>
            <p>But ſuch is the well-tempered conſtancy of the not to be altered <hi>Members,</hi> that maugre Malice and Envy, they ſtill continue in their firſt reſolved temper, Namely, a <hi>regulated Monarchy,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Conceſſion in the Iſle <hi>Wight,</hi> a <hi>Democratical</hi> Houſe of Commons in its primitive Original, ſoon joyned to the <hi>Fountain of Honour</hi> by an <hi>Oligarchical</hi> Peerage; which Three (without blaſphemy be it ſpoken) reſemble the <hi>Deity,</hi> and each of them on the other ſo conſiſtent, that though there be Peace in the circumference, yet ſtill they unite in the Center.</p>
            <p>It is therefore a ſin to doubt a Defect: in them whoſe realities cure the Imperfections of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the worſt that can be ſaid of them being only this, that having deviated, they now return into the right Path. A good Preſident to the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>With what Triumph and Exaltation did the Streets Ecchoe and Reſound at this Reſtauration, as already confident of a Settlement from them in Power, whoſe promiſes were ſo rich while laid aſide, I really hope the fullneſs of our Expectation ſhall from them receive the deſired ſatisfaction; ſo ſhall they by all, be juſtly Entituled, <hi>Patres Patriae, The Fathers of their Countrey; The Repairers of Breaches, and the Reſtorers of Paths to dwell in.</hi>
