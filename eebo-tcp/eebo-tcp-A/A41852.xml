            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:36203:1"/>
what tyranny by his Power, and in his Name was done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Members of Chriſt, as did appear by his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them to be ſo inhumanely uſed as they were, both by impriſonments, baniſhments, and ſetting of them gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Pillories, burning of them with hot Irons, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their ears from their heads, beſides whipping and ſtocking, with many more bloody cruelties; all which cruelties being by the King ſuffered and connived at, was the only cauſe why the wrath of God with his revengeful Judgements came upon him, his poſterity, and the three Nations of <hi>England, Scotland, and Ireland, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet notwithſtanding, you that are in preſent Power know theſe things, do even as he did, ſuffer the Saints in your Name, and by your power daylie to be impriſoned, and otherwayes afflicted; and that you may not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thereof, I have been moved to make the ſame known unto you by way of declaration, which is grounded upon the Holy Scriptures; wherein is contained the manner of our ſufferings, and by whom: Together, with ſerious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements concerning the abuſe of Power, and the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Prieſthood, the wickedneſs of Lawyers, with them combining for to deſtroy the Juſt from off the earth.</p>

            <head>The unlawfulneſs of the National Prieſthood, with their unjust demands proved by way of grounds &amp; reaſons, laid down according to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, why there ungodly Wages of Tythes, by the ſuffering, perſecuted, and every wayes afflicted Members of Christ Jeſus in this their day of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to him, are denyed, as by this following Declaration will be made appear.</head>
            <p>HUmbly ſheweth unto you, O ye Rulers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the abominations which are committed in the matters of tythes by the called Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> and others, for as much as that it doth evidently appear by the Law of the Lord God of Iſrael, Tythes were given to <hi>Levi</hi> and his ſons, and to ſuch as with them were appointed of God unto the Office of the firſt Prieſthood, and none elſe, who had a commandment to take tythes of the people
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36203:3"/>
according to the Law, that is of their Brethren, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; of vvhich Prieſthood the Prieſts of this Nation are not; for they cannot prove themſelves made by the Law of God, as the firſt Prieſthood vvas; neither can it be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear they ever received from the Lord God of Iſrael any ſuch commandment for their taking tythes of the people of England, as the Aaronical and Levitical Prieſthood did for their taking tythes of their Brethren the children of Iſrael; as for the Prieſts of this Nation it vvill appear they never vvere made Prieſts of God, but by the late Biſhops, who themſelves vvere formerly made by the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> as I ſhall make appear tovvards the later end of this Treatiſe, by the Lavvs and Statutes of this Nation</p>
            <p>And again I find that the Prieſts, the Levites, and all the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> had no part of Inheritance vvith Iſrael, and therefore vvere they appointed to eat the Offerings of the Lord made by fire; becauſe they had no Inheritance amongſt their Brethren, for the Lord vvas their Inheritance; Read <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. v. 1, 2. And as it doth appear by <hi>Moſes</hi> in his refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to give them any poſſeſſions of Lands vvith their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren after God had given them victory over ſuch of their Enemies as they became poſſeſſors, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Lands of thoſe many Kings vvhich vvere ſlain of them by the edge of the Svvord; and nothing vvas by <hi>Moſes</hi> given to the Tribe of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> becauſe ſaid he, the Lord God of Iſrael vvas their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as he had ſaid unto them, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 19. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again it doth and may appear, that the Lord God of Iſrael did appoint Store-houſes, unto vvhich the people were expreſly commanded in the time of the firſt Covenant for to bring their tythes, that thither the Widovv, the Fatherleſs, and Stranger, might alſo come within the Gates of the Prieſts to be filled; by which it is manifeſt, That the Widovv, Fatherleſs and Stranger had as much right to the Tythes as the Prieſt; through vvhich relief there vvas not a beggar in Iſrael; neither vvere they (the Prieſts and Levites) permitted to perſecute any upon Trebble Damages vvho did not bring their Tythes according to the Commandment of the Lord;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36203:3"/>
for they that did neglect vvere curſed vvith a curſe, as it is evident, <hi>Mal</hi> 3. Novv the contrary doth appear among the Prieſts of England; whom I have heard often ſay, They vvere of Gods ovvn Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and yet live in the practiſe of ſuch abominable things, and do alſo juſtifie ſuch as with them do the ſame, as never vvas committed nor done in the time of the firſt Prieſthood, as is daylie made manifeſt in that unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable vvickedneſs of theirs in taking avvay peoples Cattel out of their yards, and Goods out of their Houſes for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Tythes upon trebble Damages, which is three for one, againſt the expreſs Lavv of God; vvhereby it doth and may appear unto ſuch as are vvith my ſelf of the ſeed of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, That it is not only the Prieſts fault alone, who are not of God, but you ſin in ſuffering of them, as you are the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the people, who do permit them in your Name, and by your Povver, to do what they do: Theſe evils rightly conſidered, doth give a diſcovery that you are departed from the Lord God of Iſrael, whom you once declared for, as doth appear by your taking part vvith the Prieſts, who are his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; or elſe if it were not ſo, your conſciences would teach you to obey, obſerve and keep the Laws; Statutes, Commandments, Precepts and Judgements of the Lord as vvell as my ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvho for keeping the ſame do ſuffer; which would not be if you did ſtand in the counſel of the Lord, vvhich then you vvould ſeek to do his will by ſeeing his Laws duly and truly executed upon ſuch as are the breakers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, vvhich vvould cauſe your dayes to be prolonged in the Land vvherein ye yet live as ſo many Enemies to that moſt holy God, whoſe juſt and righteous Laws yea even hate to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, obſerve, and keep, and in effect do amongſt your ſelves conclude, That the Government vvhich God Almighty did appoint his people to be governed by according to his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Order, vvhich by you is not judged good enough, nor wiſe enough to be governed by in your generations, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by your ruling of the people with ſuch Laws as you and other tranſgreſſors before you did from Imagination make, and ſet up to oppoſe the Laws, Commandments, and Statutes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36203:4"/>
of the onely wiſe God; for vvhich vvickedneſs of theirs ſo committed, the juſt judgement and vengeance of the Lord hath from one generation to another deſtroyed both them and theirs from off the earth, and yet you are not ſenſible for what they have been cut off, although he hath made uſe of you as Inſtruments in his hand to cut off the late King for his diſobedience to the Lord God of Iſrael, who ſtood not in his counſel, but vvas driven aſide by the flattery of wicked Prieſts and Lawyers as you are, although little notice by you is taken thereof.</p>
            <p>I therefore deſire from my heart in love to your ſouls, that you did fully underſtand and know wherefore the Lord did permit you to put the King to death, and then you would ſeek how to do his vvill, and not your own; and then who do you think would harm you? but becauſe you do not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that you delight not in the Law of the Lord, as King <hi>David</hi> his ſervant did, for which cauſe plots and conſpiracies are daylie and juſtly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Giving of you to know, and all in Authority with you, That foraſmuch as you by your Power do uphold the Prieſts of this Nation for to take the wages of the Law of the Lord God of Iſrael by way of tythes, which peculiarly was given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the firſt Prieſthood for their ſervice done, which was their right both by Law and Commandment, during that legal Miniſtration: Now I ſay, the contrary doth appear by theſe Prieſts, for that they do not the work and ſervice which the Law of tythes requireth ſhould be done, therefore tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors they are, and you alſo guilty of the ſame tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for that they are by you ſupported and upheld for to ſerve in their falſe Miniſtry, contrary to what the Lord hath appointed, who did command that theſe Prieſts in the firſt Covenant ſhould be clothed with holy Garments while their ſervice was by them a diſcharging, which the Prieſts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do not appear in; neither have they in uſe the Water of Purification, nor do they ſerve at the Altar of the worldly Sanctuary, as the Aaronical and Levitical Prieſts did, who made ready all the Burnt-offrings, Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where I ſay is there an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of theſe ſervices by our counterſeit Engliſh Prieſts done? neither do they circumciſe as the firſt Prieſthood did, who performed what was by them of the Law required according to the will of God, unto whom the right of tythes did appertain by way of a peculiar Gift for their work, and ſervice done, as doth appear <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36203:5"/>
diſſemblers with that people, we are by them ſeduced, for that they receive of them Tythes, the wages of the Law, which did belong to the Levitical Prieſthood, who left not their work undone as they do: And thus by their wicked actions they appear not to be called of God as thoſe Prieſts were, who had Store-houſes to put Tythes into, as is evident, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. that thither the Widow, Fatherleſs, and Stranger might come read <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 27, 28, 29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for to be filled and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied within the Gates of the Prieſts, that there might not be a beggarin Iſrael: Now by what hath been already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it doth appear, That neither the Prieſts have right to Tythes, nor none elſe. Yet notwithſtanding Tythes by the Laws of the Pope are forced to be paid in this Nation, and neither Widows, Fatherleſs; nor Strangers ſuffered for to partake with the Prieſts thereof, but inſtead of being out of them relieved, they are forced for to pay Tythes, and ſuch as do not, are by them impriſoned; never was there any ſuch cruelties by the Prieſts under the Law unto the Widows, Fatherſeſs and Strangers done, as is by theſe Prieſts of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who are of the Pope, (but ſurely wo will be their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward according to what Chriſt hath pronounced, which will aſſuredly come upon them and their Aſſiſtances) for their binding heavy burthens upon the poor, too grievous for to be born, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. never was there ſuch Prieſts known ſince the world began, as theſe deceivers, deluders, and Seducers are, who do appear to be Gods adverſaries, with whom it ſhall go ill; read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. <hi>And ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the mighty One of Iſrael, Ah!

            <p>And ſo far as I can underſtand from friends which doth give me an account of what they underſtand from amongſt you, that there is nothing to be expected from you, but more bonds to be laid upon the Saints; at which nevvs I finde in my ſelf a comfortable ſatisfaction for to continue my waiting upon the farther good pleaſure of the Lord God of Iſrael, rather then to ſin againſt my conſcience by giving way to break his Laws, Commandments, Ordinances, and Statutes, for vvhich I have ſuffered perſecution for above this eight years together; firſt by one <hi>John Lawſon</hi> a drunken Prieſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Pariſh of <hi>Baſinborne</hi> in the County of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> who for Tythes took away my goods, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding was not therewith contented, vvhile ſuch time as by his cruelty he drove me to flie with my Family twenty miles from that Town by the reaſon he had gained a Warrant from the Committees of that County for to carry my body to priſon, refuſing to take Bail, according as the Warrant did expreſs. But ſoon after I had removed my ſelf and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily from his Tyrannie, an other Enemy to the Goſpel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared againſt me, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>John Budging</hi> of the ſame Town, Farmer of the Tythes, belonging to the Parſonage, who perſecuted me at the popiſh Law; and after he had ſpent ſome time, gained power alſo for to carry me away to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, notwithſtanding he had carryed away a great part of my Corn out of the field; through which Tyrannie of his I was forced to forſake my poor Wife and Children, which conſtrained me to put my life upon the danger of looſing, by reaſon I fled to the Army of the Common-Wealth of <hi>England</hi> for refuge into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where as a Souldier I did engage, in hopes of gaining not only victory over ſuch as was then counted our Enemies, but alſo to have ſeen an end of that their power by which tyrannie and oppreſſion is ſtill promoteed: And after the wars of <hi>Scotland</hi> were over, there followed on <hi>Worceſter-Fight,</hi> where I was alſo bodily enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and after that Field-Battel was fought, I returned pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatelely home to viſite my poor Wife and diſtreſſed Family;

but not long after my adverſary obtained intelligence that I was at home, and thereupon did ſend certain ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> for to carry me away to priſon, which for to accompliſh their end, did by force of Arms break into my houſe upon me; but being by me ſtrongly reſiſted with Sword and Piſtol, they durſt not proceed the attempting to come up into my Chambers, where I was ready to receive them; they perceiving of it, did quarrel amongſt themſelves about raiſing of the Town for to pull down the houſe upon my head, they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſorely to have me forth dead or alive; I underſtanding the ſame, did through the help of the Lord make my paſs out of an upper-Windovv, leaving my poor Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their bloody rage, who did accordingly ſet a drawn Sword to her Breaſt, and did threaten to kill her after they did ſee I was eſcaped: Many more inſufferable cruelties have I and my Family undergone, which are too many for me to give relation: But to be brief; So precious vvas my liberty unto me when time was, that the very thoughts of a Gaol was un to me dreadful, that vvhile I was at liberty, I was in migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bondage through the continual fear of being betrayed, which at length vvas brought to paſs by one <hi>Crooply</hi> a Broker, Shop-keeper ſometime of the Tovvn of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> vvho as I underſtand did receive from my enemy a pretty roundſum of mony forto betray me; vvhich accordingly he effected by his diſcovering where I vvas at a Friends houſe, at vvhich houſe I was ſeized on by ſeveral Serjeants, &amp; brought away to priſon, it being upon the third day of the ſecond month, called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> in the year 1654. where I have ever ſince remained, and many times and often in great neceſſity, by reaſon my poor Wife hath not had left wherewith all to relieve me with the value of 12. d. in money all this time of my long and harſh impriſonment as ſhe with weeping tears hath unto me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt; and I ſeeing her diſtreſs, have been forced to borrow money for to relive her; this being the truth according to what hath been by me declared, I ſhall leave the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof unto you the Rulers for to judge according to conſcience, whether theſe outrages by you ought any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

to be ſuffered, ſeeing they are done againſt the Law of the Lord God of Iſrael, and alſo againſt your own promoted Laws, as they are now become executed, ſeeing the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Courts are down; and it is alſo contrary to Law for any man to be kept in priſon as I have been and not relieved, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that had not the Lord in mercy towards me raiſed up ſome few of his beloved people, who live in the life of Righteouſneſs, for to have taken care of me in this time of my harſh affliction I might unavoidably have periſhed not only by hunger and nakedneſs, but by cold alſo, for that I could not come to receive the benefit of the heat of fire for the ſpace of two Yeers and ſeven months: Now judge I pray you who are wiſe in heart, whether my ſufferings have not been ſad, yea or no, as to the outward man, although mine Enemies are pleaſed to laugh at my affliction, they ſaying, I would not accept of Liberty if it were given me, I like the Priſon ſo well; but the Devil was a lyar from the beginning, and therefore I ſhall not here ſtand to ſpend time to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further anſwer to their lyes, but do declare, I am forced to be a Priſoner contrarie to the Law of the Lord God of Iſrael, and alſo the invented Laws of rebellious men, which are called the Laws of the Land.

But yet you Rulers
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36203:9"/>
may object and ſay, <hi>Tythes are not now demanded for to be paid upon a Goſpel account, but upon a civil account:</hi> My anſwer is, There was never no ſuch Law which did require Tythes for to be paid upon a civil account; but a Statute there is that was made the 27. of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. chap 2. ſaith, Tythes are due to God and holy Church. But then it may be further ſaid, That although it be ſo, yet <hi>Ceſar</hi> ought to have his due, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom muſt be given to whom cuſtom belongs; ſo that Tythes upon the account of Cuſtom and Tribute ought to be paid, <hi>ſor we muſt be ſubject to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake,</hi> that I do grant.</p>
            <p>But what makes that for the lawfulneſs of paying Tithes? not any thing at all, becauſe they were not cuſtomarilie paid, but by a Law and Commandment from God were they gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> &amp; that Prieſthood; which Law and commandment I am ſure doth not own neither <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſts nor Lay-men: Therefore ſeeing there is no Law neither from God nor man that doth command Tythes to be paid, then upon neceſſitie it muſt be by you granted, there can be no tranſgreſſion; and upon that account it will appear, that all ſuch as do force Tythes to be paid, are tranſgreſſors to God Almighty, for that they are deniers to do what his Law doth require, wherein is declared, That Tythes were peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly appointed unto the Aaronical and Levitical Prieſthood, as I have ſaid from which the poor were relieved, and were not paid by cuſtom, as doth appear <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. and ſuch as did neglect to pay, robbed God, and not the Prieſts: And again, if cuſtom ſhould have been obſerved by the Saints and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants of God, then ſhould they never have ſuffered ſuch cruel perſecutions as they did under the Rulers of the World, that muſt alſo be granted but becauſe they denie to obſerve their cuſtomes ſo ſoon as they came to know the Lord, and did him obey, then came their ſufferings upon them; as for Inſtance, That famous Witneſs of Chriſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> after he came to live in the enjoiment of the life, as the Scriptures beareth witneſs he did, then he denied to obſerve the cuſtoms of the Jews, for which he was by the

rude multitude abuſed, and judged not worthy to live, as the Saints now are who bears witneſs unto the ſame truth in life, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, which made the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, <hi>He taught all men eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where againſt the people and the Law, and that he brought in Greeks to pollute the holy Temple, and had perſwaded all the Jews and Gentiles to forſake the Law of Moſes, ſaying they ought not to be circumciſed, neither walk after their cuſtoms; whereupon all the City was moved againſt him, and the people ran together, and drew</hi> Paul <hi>out of the Temple, Acts</hi> 21. And is not the like trade of crueltie by the Prieſts of this Nation, and ſuch as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, who are their Proſelites, ſtill carried on againſt the dear Saints and Servants of God, who are moved by the Lord for to go into their Steeplehouſes for to declare againſt their filthy lying abominations; this cannot be denied, for it is too much manifeſted in the Citie of <hi>London;</hi> but to haſten: And alſo I find that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>The cuſtoms of the people were vain,</hi> Jer. 10. And likewiſe the children of Ifrael were from the Lord expreſlie commanded not to obſerve the cuſtoms in the Land of thoſe people which the Lord for the ſame wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs caſt out, by which the Land was defiled, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 3, <hi>&amp;c.

an evil cuſtom or uſage by you the Rulers, who profeſs your ſelves Chriſtians for to be aboliſhed, according to the ſaying of Judge <hi>Cook</hi> upon <hi>Littleton.</hi> Now I appeal unto the Saints with you, for to judge what greater evil there can be by you permitted anſwerable to the maintaining of ſuch a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men as doth plead for the upholding of ſuch cuſtoms and wicked uſages as deny Chriſt, and doth command me and all Saints to give Wages unto ſuch as never did nor doth any Work for me or mine; ſurely this muſt needs be judged to be not onely againſt reaſon, but againſt the very being of a good conſcience, wherein God hath written the Witneſs of his Eternal Law, by which I ſee all Laws, Cuſtoms, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions for to be null and void, and are no Preſcriptions nor Cuſtoms, being things void in themſelves, becauſe againſt Juſtice, as doth appear in <hi>Doctor and Student,</hi> chapter the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay again, That all Laws, Statutes, Cuſtoms, Uſages, or Preſcriptions, which would ſet up and uphold that which God by Chriſt hath diſannulled and made void, is no leſs then High Treaſon againſt God for any of you Rulers for to attempt to maintain that which is againſt the Law of the holy One of Iſrael. And again The Prieſts of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who ſtand by your Power, have been both they and their Predeceſſors, ſo notoriouſly changing and changeable, that they have made nothing perfect; and for me to own ſuch as is not of Chriſt is clearly againſt my conſcience; and ſeeing they are not of Chriſt, nor are found one amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor indeed never were, as it doth appear by the Laws and Statutes of this Nation, which doth declare and manifeſt they have been always ſuch as did with men and times change according to the wills of ſuch as came, to get Rule and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination over the People, unto whom they alwayes became ſubject, as this generation of Prieſts have done, and would again do, I am perſwaded, if an event turn or change of Government ſhould come, then would they again quickly appear in their colours; or if God ſhould order your hearts that are now in Rule to do his will, then would you ſoon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36203:11"/>
prove what mettle they are made of, if you would promiſe to give every one of them 100. l. a year upon condition they would for bear their preaching, as they call it, and ſuch as would not ſhould have nothing, then I am confident they would be as mute as fiſh, and as dumb as he that never could ſpeak.</p>
            <p>But to haſten, that ſo I may ſhew and further make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that which the Prieſts can no wayes deny, concerning their Predeceſſors, how that they in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, ſome time King of <hi>England,</hi> denyed the Pope, and would not own him any longer for to be their chief Head, although they had been by him made Prieſts; but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that they declined him, and owned <hi>Henry</hi> the eight for to be their chief Head, rather then they would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the looſing of their beaſtly [read the Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church.] Honors, Dignities and Poſſeſſions, which was brought in and maintained by Tythes. And then they again in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth made another no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table turn and denyed the Maſs-Book and received the Book of COMMON-PRAYER at his Commandment. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in the time of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> they denyed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book, and received the Maſs-Book. And in the dayes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> they denyed the Maſs-Book, and again received the Book of Common-Prayer. And in the time of the late old Parliament this generation of <hi>Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamiſh</hi> Prieſts, who love the Wages of unrighteouſneſs, being willing for to follow the example of their Makers, the late late Biſhops, denyed the Book of Common-Prayer and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Pamphlet, called the Directory, rather then they would offend their great Maſters the late old wicked Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who for their ſervice done, did grant them an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for to take Tythe-Eggs, Pigs, and Geeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the true Miniſters of Chriſt never did.

And again ſaith the Statute, The Pope and the See of <hi>Rome</hi> did in the time of their rule reſerve unto himſelf amongſt other things the tryal of the right of Tythes, as doth appear by the Statute of the 26. of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, ſome time King of <hi>England:</hi> and in chap. 1 it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That he and his Succeſſors were the onely ſupreme Head of this called Church of England.</p>
            <p>Thus have I made appear the root of theſe Prieſts, and their fhundation have I alſo made manifeſt, and diſcovered not to be of Chriſt, but have proceeded from man, who have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly erected two places for their breeding up of Prieſts, <hi>viz. Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> which are by them called two Eyes, for the furniſhing every pariſh in England, with able lying ſeducers, where is alſo by them Churches built at the charge of the ignorant people, wherein is alſo provided for the ſervice of the whoriſh Prieſts Funts and Baſons for the management and carrying on of what they ſo gravely ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe with much pretended ſeeming zeal, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſprinkling of Infants, which they ſay is baptiſm, but they lye, for which

            <p>Thus through the aſſiſtance of Chriſt Jeſus have I accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Goſpel proved the Prieſts of the Nation to be no Miniſters of Chriſt, nor Meſſengers of God, which is my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ground why I deny to pay them or any elſe Tythes, who are ſuch as the Lord God of Iſrael for their oppreſſion will feed with their own fleſh, yea ſaith he, <hi>They ſhall be drunk with their own blood; and then ſhall they know that I am the Lord, the Saviour of them whom they oppreſs.</hi> Read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 26.

they may hinder the promoting the cauſe of truth, and the eſtabliſhing of Juſtice; through which wickedneſs of theirs when time was in dividing the people from the King, and ſetting him againſt the people, Juſtice by him was wholly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, although he was much ſought to by the people of God for to ſee the ſame duely adminiſtred, as he was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God to be the chief Magiſtrate of the three united Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> but he not ſtanding in the counſel of God, would not hearken unto the deſires of his people, but grew weary in hearing them, whereupon no more addreſſes by them unto him was made; wherefore his end ſuddenly upon him came, and therefore juſtly did the God of Juſtice deliver him up into the hands of thoſe which ſought his life: Let good heed therefore be taken by you that are in preſent Power, leaſt the cauſe be forgotten which brought him to ſuffer the pangs of death; for know you, the Lords hand is not ſhortned, but is ſtretched out ſtill for to reach you alſo forth from all your Guards of Guns, Swords and Pikes, which by multitudes of men is made uſe of for to defend you; yet notwithſtanding your ſtrong Arm of fleſh, you may take notice, the King had as great a power in his time as you, and was more eſteemed, regarded, and beloved by the people, as to the generality, then poſſibly can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined you are; but yet he not doing that which was right in the ſight of God, you ſee was cut off. Oh therefore that you may remember with all ſpeed for to eſtabliſh Juſtice, that ſo you may rule for him for the good and well-being of his poor diſtreſſed and every wayes afflicted and perſecuted people, who are at this day fruſtrated of all hopes of mans doing Juſtice, and therefore cry they unto the Lord for to be delivered from the hands of their oppreſſors, ſeeing hitherto you have denyed their redemption, notwithſtanding you have ſworn unto the Lord you would give them deliverance: This know therefore, your time to perform what you have engaged and promiſed is almoſt paſt; therefore what you do, do ſpeedily; for I behold your night a coming, and then will all your Works ceaſe, and then vvil all your intentions, with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36203:16"/>
former pretences come to be fruſtrated and annihilated, and your memorials vvill alſo be blotted out from under Heaven, and your very Names vvill then become a ſtinck to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and you poſterities will be made miſerable, like unto the diſtreſſed children of the late King, vvho being left without Habitation, are become vvanderers about in ſtrange Lands, unto vvhom you cannot afford to ſhevv pitty nor compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; can you therefore imagine, that if Juſtice (vvhich is the exalting of a Nation) be by you any longer neglected, that you ſhall receive more favour then they have found at your hands? ſurely no: Therefore remember what <hi>Samuel</hi> did to <hi>Agag,</hi> and for what he was hewed in pieces; Read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 33. <hi>Wo to him that increaſeth that which is not his; ſhall they not riſe up ſuddenly that ſhall bite thee, and awake that ſhall vex thee? and thou ſhalt be for booties unto them, becauſe thou haſt ſpoyled many Nations; all the remnant of the people ſhall ſpoyle thee becauſe of mens blood, and for the violence of the Land, of the City, and of all that dwell therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou haſt conſulted ſhame to thy houſe by cutting off many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and haſt ſinned againſt thy ſoul, for which the Stone ſhall cry out of the Wall, and the beam out of the Timber ſhall anſwer it;</hi> Read <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 6, 7 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>But to haſten, that ſo I may proceed to ſhew unto you the great abominations that are done &amp; committed by your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp; in your Name, <hi>viz.</hi> by thoſe forementioned wicked wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Prieſts and Lavvyers, who are together confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for to commit the horrible and ſilthy thing in the Land, as I have already ſhewn, and ſhall make further manifeſt by thoſe Laws which yov have ſworn to maintain, which Laws ſay it is utterly unlawful to impriſon any one while they dye. And yet notwithſtanding, how many hundreds in this Nation are unjuſtly kept in priſon at this day, ready to periſh, and many already ſince this time of your governing, have periſhed; I wiſh their blood may not be laid to your charge for ſuffering it, ſeeing the Law doth judge it Man-ſlaughter: be pleaſed therefore to read <hi>Mirrour of Juſtice,</hi> pag. 88. 27, 28. fol. 294. And again, the Law doth further ſay, <hi>That to</hi>

               <hi>ſuffer any to dy in priſon through want</hi> as I am given to underſtand ſome lately in the Kings Bench have done, is alſo by the ſame Law judged Man-ſlaughter; and likewiſe for Judges to delay relieving Priſoners by the Law till they dye, is alſo Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter; for ſuffering of which, and for not doing what the Law did require for the relief of the impriſoned, one Judge <hi>Pearne</hi> was convicted and hanged; See for this <hi>Mirrour of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> fol. 228. pag. 30.</p>
            <p>Now it doth evidently appear from this foregoing matter, That there was a glorious face of Juſtice did in thoſe times which were counted <hi>Pagan</hi> manifeſtly appear, wherein Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Righteouſneſs and Judgment according to their agreed-upon Laws, was duly and truly, without reſpect of perſons, adminiſtred and executed upon ſuch as were found the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of the Rights and Priviledges of the people; but ſince that time that Juſtice took his ſeat and Royal Throne in this Nation, wicked and ungodly men have for many Ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther born Rule, through whom Juſtice hath been kept as a ſtranger out of this Land, whereby truth is fallen; and ſuch as have through the fear of the Lord departed from Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are become a prey, as is evident by ſuch as with my ſelf do at this day ſuffer impriſonment for our earneſt contending for publike Juſtice, and open puniſhment to be inflicted upon ſuch as are known to be truths perverters, betrayers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſers of the righteous Laws, Ordinances, Statutes, Precepts, Commandments and Judgements of the Lord God of Iſrael, as doth and may further appear by the Witneſs and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Paul</hi> that called, choſen, and famous Apoſtle of Chriſt; read 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7 8 9, 10 where it doth evidently appear, <hi>Paul</hi> the true Miniſter of Chriſt was earneſtly exhorting of <hi>Timothy</hi> above all things to take heed unto the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unto the end, that he might know charity from out of a pure heart was the ſum, wherein the whole was contained, from whence the exerciſe oſ a pure conſcience was to be ſet on work, according to that unfeigned Faith that dwelt in the Apoſtle, from which, ſaith he, ſome have ſwerved and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſide, deſiring to be Teachers of the Law, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm. Theſe words conſidered by the wiſe in heart, whom God hath filled with the ſpirit of Wiſdom, who are the perſons I do appeal unto, for to judge whether this Complaint and juſt Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apoſtle is not as well againſt England, as againſt thoſe Uſurpers and Abuſers of the Law which did live in his time, ſeeing we are the people that have broken ſo many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements which unto the Lord Jeſus and his Members was made in the time of the beginning of the great troubles of theſe three Nations.</p>
            <p>But I muſt haſten, and come to the words of the faithful Miniſter of Chriſt, from whence I have a little digreſt; from which declaration of his it doth appear how wonderfully he (exalted) the Law of God, who ſaid to <hi>Timothy; We know that the Law is good if a man uſe it lawfully, knowing this, that it was not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſs and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for unholy, prophane, for ſinners, for murtherers of Fathers, &amp; Mothers; for Man-ſlayers; for Whoremongers, and for them thus defile themſelves with mankind; and for M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of man for the Lords ſake, knowing the Earth is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof; but yet notwithſtanding, that if any in Authority ſhall go about to take from me and mine any part of the Earth which God ſhall give us further to be poſſeſſed with, then I ſhall not reſiſt; for I muſt needs be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not only for fear of the wrath of fooliſh, proud, vain man, who is ready to be offended at what he ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be aſhamed of, then to juſtifie himſelf. Thus for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake as I have learned of Chriſt, am I freely willing to ſubmit my ſelf unto every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, although my deadly Enemies have reported otherwaies againſt me, which the Lord our God knows I purely ſuffer for that I cannot give unto his Enemies that for Maintainance which belongs unto him, <hi>viz.</hi> Tythes which unjuſt demands I muſt for conſcience ſake deny, although I come to ſuffer death for the ſame, ſeeing it is clearly manifeſt from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that whoſoever payeth Tythes denyeth Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, as all they do which at this day do either pay or receive the ſame, as I have made fully appear from the ſum of the holy Scriptures: And thus to both you Rulers, Saints and People of all forms, ſects and ſorts, have I truly diſcharged my conſcience according to the gift of God in me by way of Grounds and Reaſons laid down, wherein I have ſhewn the juſtice of my cauſe, and have therein matter of great comfort thus to declare why Tythes have been, and are by me ſtill denyed; in which Grounds I have made an eminent diſcovery, That Tythes in England have been, and are forced to be paid contrary both to the Laws of God, and alſo to the Laws of the Land, which Laws I have not broke, but do ſuffer for my obeying the Law of the Lord God of Iſrael; in which obedience I hope he will help me to be continued in the further remaining part of the dayes of this my Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, whoſe ſervant I am, and do finde in my ſelf a freedom in like manner to be ſubject to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake onely, whether
