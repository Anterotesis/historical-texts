            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for ſometime, by the pious arguments of his Parents, and the fear of coming
to a Publick ſhame, he forſooke his ill ways, and had an inclination to goe to
Sea, for Which, ſome proviſions were made about four years ſince, but conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

fully weaned from the viſits and inſinuations of his former lewd companions,
he ſpurned againſt good council, and the Convixions formerly made upon

which brought him to this immature and untimely end.</p>

in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> for a Robbery committed on him, and was committed to the
<hi>Gate-Houſe,</hi> but in a little time found a means by his inſinuating tongue to
make his eſcape from his Keeper: Since which time he hath been concerned

in his Robberies, having committed one in <hi>Eſſex</hi> but a few days before he was
taken, which was very accidental in his Inn, he was carried before a Magiſtrate
and committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where he was kept very cloſe, and loaded with a
pair of Irons of an extraordinary weight, from whence he was removed to
<hi>Hartford</hi> where he took his Tryal at the Asſiſes, ſeveral Indictments being
brought againſt him, upon one of which he was convicted, and received Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Death,</p>
            <p>He behaved himſelfe with that modeſty upon his Tryal, that ſeveral enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

            <p>Of all, which having notice, he began to apply himſelfe to
repent and conſider his latter end, and had ſeveral viſits from a
Parſon who aſſured him of the ſalvation of his Soul, if not his
Body, in order to which, ſome applications were made by his
means, but proving ineffectual, the Prieſt acquainted him he
muſt prepare for Death: upon which he was deſired by
Mr. <hi>King,</hi> to deſiſt in his viſits, for he knew the way to heaven
