         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the Earles of Lindsey and

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Earle of <hi>Lindsey</hi> and <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
petitioned to his Majesty both,
to return to his Parliament (as was
expressely intimated in their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
and humbly desired his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
to assent unto those Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which were sent by the <hi>Parliament:</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
therein, That they had nothing in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and thoughts more precious and of higher
esteeme (next to the honour and immediate Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Almighty God) then the just and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
performance of their duty to his Majesty,
and their fidelity to the Kingdome? These said
Earles were sent for from York to attend the
House the precedent Weeke; but they shewed
the Messenger of the House speciall Warrants
under his Majesties Hand, expressely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to the contrary, and that should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his Majesty there, till his further pleasure
should be declared unto them.</p>
            <p>But they being very sensible of the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32902:3"/>
of this Kingdome, and what irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable
danger those inconveniences may produce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if not prevented before they grow to maturity,
after a deliberate observation of the causes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
did present their dutifull Petition to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in the posture as well of all sincerity as
humility: That out of his Princely Wisedome,
for the establishing his own Honours, and Safety,
and gracious tendernesse of the welfare and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Subjects and Dominions, He would
be pleased to returne to his <hi>Parliament,</hi> as being
the most necessary and principall means (through
Gods blessing) of removing those jealousies and
differences, which have unhappily fallen betwixt
him and his People, and as the effectuall way to
procure both to his Majesty and to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
a constant course of their Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>
            <p>His Majesty tooke the Petition very graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and desired some time of serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
thereon, and then he would give them an
effectuall Answer. For all the distractions, and
distempers of this Kingdome are derived onely
from his Majesties absence, and if he would be so
condescentious as to returne, questionlesse these
suspitions would be expelled, and better opinions
entertained. And it is very requisite, That the
great affaires of this Kingdome, may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
or transacted by the advice of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Man, or by any unknowne and unsworne
Councellor; but that such matters as concerne
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32902:3"/>
State and the publike accommodation of the
Realme, are proper for the high Court of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which is his Majesties great and supreme
Councell, ought to be debated, resolved, and
transacted onely in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and not elsewhere.
And such as shall presume to doe any thing to
the contrary, ought to be reserved to the censure
and Judgement of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and such other
matters of State as are proper for your Majesties
Privie Councell ought also to be debated and
concluded by such of the Nobility and orhers, as
shall from time to time be chosen for that place,
by approbation of both Houses of <hi>Parliament;</hi>
and that no publike Act concerning the Affaires
of the Kingdome, which are proper for your Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
Councell may be esteemed of any validity,
as proceeding from the Royall Authority, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be done by the advice and consent of the
Major part of the Councell, attested under their
Hands.</p>
            <p>And without doubt His Majesty will conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to so faire a proposition, for the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is his high and chiefe Court and Councell;
wherefore it is very expedient, that the doubtfull
matters of State should be descided, discussed,
and concluded by that high Senate.</p>
