         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>e children of men. In the ability of the strength of the Lord I declare his Word to thy tender Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, O <hi>Sion,</hi> whom the Lord God beholds, how you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed about with the ravenous Beasts of the field, and given up by the Children of men, for to be laid waste, and to race up the Foundation of your strength if it were possible, that so the pure and living Worship of God in the Spirit, may not be known in the Earth.</p>
            <p>O dear and tender Children of the Immortal Birth, which maketh Self of no reputation, whom the Lord hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and chosen to be his living Witnesses upon the Earth, to bear Testimony of his great and glorious Name amongst the people; fear not Man whose breath is in his nostrils, neither regard evil tydings of what men intend to do with you: O be faithful upon your watch, that you may stand in a good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Light and Life over all the appearance of evil in the Inward-man, that would draw your minds from staidness in the Power of the Lord God, that so the evil spy of the mind may never have power, that would run forth in the reach of your reason, to judge of what will come to pass in the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part, and so cause fainting and feebleness of mind; tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the dark Judgement, which is out of the Light and Power of God; as the evil Spyes did in the dayes of old, who brought
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104064:3"/>
evil tydings of the good Land: Therefore all you Servants of the Most High God, stand fast in his Counsel, who saith, <hi>I am God Alsufficient, walk before me, and be ye perfect,</hi> in that to reign over all, what ever is contrary to the will of God, that so in the free resignation of your wills, with all that you have and are, you may be a living Sacrifice upon his Altar, with singleness of heart, standing approved before the Throne of his Glory, with boldness and holy confidence, without the least doubting or wavering of mind, but that the Lord will go before you, and with joy and gladness of heart carry you through, what ever he hath determined, to the perfecting his Praise and Glory of his Name for ever.</p>
            <p>And dear Friends in God, you are not ignorant of the the tender Love of our Father, who in the Authority of his own Spirit, sent to proclaim this day of tryal in your ears certain years ago, that every Child might look up to the Power of the Lord, to be prepared to meet him in the day determined, which now is manifest in the sight of all people that love the Lord; To whom I declare in the Authority of the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Life, that your deliverance is sealed in the Eternal and Unchangeable Decree of the Most High God; let all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of darkness do what they are permitted, fear not you chosen Vessels, for not any more of the wrath of man shall have power then you shall have ability in God's Sufficiency to rejoyce, triumph, praise and magnifie the Name of the Lord, through and over all the wrath of man, all your dayes, until your Change come, and for ever when time shall be no more; and God will be the God of your families and tender Children, who never did nor will forsake the Righteous, neither suffer their Seed to beg their bread.</p>
            <p>Therefore lift up your heads in the Power of the Lord, you chosen Vessels, for you shall prevail and overcome through the Blood of the Lamb, and the Word of your Testimony, and no more shall love your lives to death, that you may do and suffer whatever the pleasure of the Lord is, who was made perfect in suffering, and did go before us unto the Father, and now is come again to receive us unto himself; therefore all in the Light behold Him, behold Him, who ascended over all

the power of Hell, and Death, and Darkness, who now in like manner is descended, whose coming we behold in the Clouds with Power and great Glory. Therefore dear Children of the Lord, with the Light judge whatever would cloud or vail you from beholding his glorious Appearance, so shall you reign over all the evil attendances of the mind; though they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so strong or many, you shall in the Power of the Lord trample upon them in the Name of Jesus; whose coming is in the Clouds, to deliver every Lamb forth of the evil that assaults the mind, thorow the Manifestation of his Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; <hi>For as the Lightening-is from the East unto the West, so is the Appearance of the Son of Man; and as the Serpent was lift up in the Wilderness, so is the Son of Man lifted up in this his Day.</hi> O let your eyes be all fixed on Him, and your hearts stedfastly believing in his Name, without wavering, though the Devil tempt, and all the Power of Darkness do what it can, in the meek Life of Jesus you shall trample upon the head of the old Serpent, and reign in the powerful Authority over all the enemies within and without for ever.</p>
            <p>And as to the Clouds that arise outwardly from men, who lay their Plots in the deep, and fetch their Counsel out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless Pit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I beseech you all in the bowels of love, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult not with flesh &amp; blood, but walk close with the Lord as at other times; as our brethren, <hi>Daniel, Shadrach, M eshach</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> did in the dayes of old, for whom the Lord appeared through all the clouds and power of Darkness, to the confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pride of <hi>Babylon</hi> in that age and generation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And certainly the Royal Birth of the Immortal Seed, which maketh Self of no reputation, shall see Christ coming thorow all the Clouds, with Power and great Glory, and in as great Majesty as ever since the world was made, for the Deliverance of his own Birth, that seeks not any thing but to glorifie his Name, with the loss of all, life it self, if the Lord requires it at their hands, to seal the Testimony of their peaceable &amp; holy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in Christ Jesus, which is in meeting, watching and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to receive the heavenly Vision.
