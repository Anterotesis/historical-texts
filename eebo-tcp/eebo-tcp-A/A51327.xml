         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THere is no way of writing so
proper, for the refining and
polishing a Language, as the
translating of Books into it, if he
that undertakes it, has a competent
skill of the one Tongue, and is a
Master of the other. When a Man
writes his own Thoughts, the heat
of his Fancy, and the quickness of
his Mind, carry him so much after
the Notions themselves, that for
the most part he is too warm to judg
of the aptness of Words, and the
<pb facs="tcp:53806:3"/>
justness of Figures; so that he either
neglects these too much, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does
them: But when a Man tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slates,
he has none of these Heats
about him: and therefore the French
took no ill Method, when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to reform and beautify their
Language, in setting their best
Writers on Work to translate the
Greek and Latin Authors into it.
There is so little praise got by Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations,
that a Man cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to it out of Vanity, for it
has past for a sign of a slow Mind,
that can amuse it self with so mean
an Entertainment; but we begin to
grow wiser, and tho ordinary Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators
must succeed ill in the esteem
of the World, yet some have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
of late that will, I hope,
bring that way of writing in credit.
The English Language has wrought
it self out, both of the fulsome Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry
<pb facs="tcp:53806:3"/>
under which it laboured long
ago, and the trifling way of dark
and unintelligible Wit that came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that, and out of the course ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance
of Canting that succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this: but as one Extream com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
produces another, so we
were beginning to fly into a sublime
pitch, of a strong but false Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,
which had much corrupted,
not only the Stage, but even the
Pulpit; two places, that tho they
ought not to be named together,
much less to resemble one another;
yet it cannot be denied, but the
Rule and Measure of Speech is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
taken from them: but that
florid strain is almost quite worn out,
and is become now as ridiculous as it
was once admired. So that without
either the Expence or Labour that
the French have undergone, our
Language has, like a rich Wine,
<pb facs="tcp:53806:4"/>
wrought out its Tartar, and is i<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>insensibly
brought to a Purity that
could not have been compassed
without much labour, had it not
been for the great advantage that
we have of a <hi>Prince,</hi> who is so great
a Judg, that his single approbation
or dislike has almost as great an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over our Language, as his
Prerogative gives him over our
Coin. We are now so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
that how defective soever our
Imaginations or Reasonings may
be, yet our Language has fewer
Faults, and is more natural and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
than it was ever at any time
before. When one compares the
best Writers of the last Age, with
these that excel in this, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is very discernable: even the
great Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> that was the
first that writ our Language correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
as he is still our best Author, yet
<pb facs="tcp:53806:4"/>
in some places has Figures so strong,
that they could not pass now before
a severe Judg. I will not provoke
the present Masters of the Stage, by
preferring the Authors of the last
Age to them: for tho they all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
that they come far short
of <hi>B. Iohnson, Beamont</hi> and <hi>Fletcher,</hi>
yet I believe they are better pleased
to say this themselves, than to have
it observed by others. Their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
is now certainly properer, and
more natural than it was formerly,
chiefly since the correction that was
given by the <hi>Rehearsal;</hi> and it is to
be hoped, that the <hi>Essay on Poetry,</hi>
which may be well matched with
the best Pieces of its kind that even
<hi>Augustus</hi>'s Age produced, will have
a more powerful Operation, if clear
sense, joined with home but gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reproofs, can work more on our
<pb facs="tcp:53806:5"/>
Writers, than that unmerciful expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of them has done.</p>
            <p>I have now much leisure, and
want diversion, so I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
some of my hours upon
Translations, in which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
no ill Patterns to my self:
but the Reader will be best able to
judg whether I have copied skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
after such Originals. This
small Volume which I now publish,
being writ by one of the greatest
Men that this Island has produced,
seemed to me to contain so many
fine and well-digested Notions,
that I thought it might be no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
nor ill entertainment to the
Nation, to put a Book in their
Hands, to which they have so
good a Title, and which has a
very common fate upon it, to be
<pb facs="tcp:53806:5"/>
more known and admired all the
World over, than here at Home.
It was once translated into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
not long after it was written;
and I was once apt to think it
might have been done by Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
More</hi> himself: for as it is in
the English of his Age, and not
unlike his Stile; so the Translator
has taken a liberty that seems
too great for any but the Author
himself, who is Master of his own
Book, and so may leave out or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Original as he pleases:
which is more than a Translator
ought to do, I am sure it is more
than I have presumed to do.</p>
            <p>It was writ in the Year 1516,
as appears by the Date of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Peter Giles</hi>'s, in which he
says, That it was sent him but a
<pb facs="tcp:53806:6"/>
few days before from the Author,
and that bears date the first of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
that Year; but I cannot
imagine how he comes to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Sheriff of <hi>London</hi> in the Title
of the Book, for in all our printed
Catalogues of Sheriffs, his Name
is not to be found. I do not think
my self concerned in the Matter
of his Book, no more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Translator is in his Author:
nor do I think <hi>More</hi> himself went
in heartily to that which is the
chief Basis of his <hi>Utopia,</hi> the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away of all <hi>Property,</hi> and the
levelling the World; but that he
only intended to set many Notions
in his Reader's way; and that he
might not seem too much in earnest,
he went so far out of all Roads to
do it the less suspected: the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness
with which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb facs="tcp:53806:6"/>
the precaution used in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
among the <hi>Utopians,</hi> makes
one think that he had a misfortune
in his own choice, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was so cautious on that
Head; for the strictness of his Life
covers him from severe Censures:
His setting out so barbarous a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
as the hiring of Assassinates
to take off Enemies, is so wild and
so immoral both, that it does not
admit of any thing to soften or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
it, much less to justify it; and
the advising Men in some Cases
to put an end to their Lives, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the Caution with
which he guards it, is a piece of
rough and fierce Philosophy. The
tenderest part of the whole Work,
was the representation he gives of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Court; and his
Discourses upon it, towards the
<pb facs="tcp:53806:7"/>
end of the first Book, in which his
Disguise is so thin, that the Matter
would not have been much plainer
if he had named him: But when
he ventured to write so freely of the
Father in the Son's Reign, and to
give such an <hi>Idea</hi> of Government
under the haughtiest Prince, and
the most impatient of uneasy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
that ever reigned in <hi>England,</hi>
who yet was so far from being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with him for it, that as he
made him long his particular
Friend, so he employed him in all
his Affairs afterwards, and raised him
to be L. Chancellor, I thought I might
venture to put it in more Modern
English: for as the Translators of
<hi>Plutarch</hi>'s <hi>Hero's,</hi> or of <hi>Tullies Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi>
are not concerned, either in
the Maxims, or in the Actions that
they relate; so I, who only tell, in
<pb facs="tcp:53806:7"/>
the best English I can, what
Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> writ in very Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Latin, must leave his Thoughts
and Notions to the Reader's cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and do think my self liable
for nothing but the fidelity of the
Translation, and the correctness of
the English; and for that I can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, that I have writ as carefully,
and as well as I can.</p>

            <head>THE
Author's Epistle
TO
PETER GILES.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am almost ashamed, my dearest <hi>Peter
Giles,</hi> to send you this Book of the
<hi>Utopian Common-Wealth,</hi> after al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a Years delay; whereas no doubt
you look'd for it within six Weeks: for as
you know I had no occasion for using my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
or for taking pains to put things
into any method, because I had nothing to do,
but to repeat exactly those things that I heard
<hi>Raphael</hi> relate in your presence; so neither
was there any occasion given for a studied
Eloquence: since as he delivered things to us
of the sudden, and in a careless Stile; so
he being, as you know, a greater Master of
<pb facs="tcp:53806:9"/>
the Greek, than of the Latin; the plainer
my words are, they will resemble his simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
the more: and will be by consequence the
nearer to the Truth, and that is all that I
think lies on me: and it is indeed the only
thing in which I thought my self concerned.
I confess, I had very little left on me in this
Matter, for otherwise the inventing and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of such a Scheme, would have put a
Man of an ordinary pitch, either of Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or of Learning, to some pains, and have
cost him some time; but if it had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that this Relation should have been
made, not only truly, but eloquently, it could
never have been performed by me, even after
all the pains and time that I could have
bestowed upon it. My part in it was so very
small, that it could not give me much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
all that belonged to me being only to give
a true and full account of the things that I
had heard: but although this required so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little of my time; yet even that little was
long denied me by my other Affairs, which
press much upon me: for while in pleading,
and hearing, and in judging or composing
of Causes, in waiting on some Men upon Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and on others out of Respect, the
greatest part of the Day is spent on other
Mens Affairs, the remainder of it must be
<pb facs="tcp:53806:9"/>
given to my Family at home: So that I can
reserve no part of it to my self, that is, to
my Study: I must talk with my Wife, and
chat with my Children, and I have somewhat
to say to my Servants; for all these things I
reckon as a part of Business, except a Man will
resolve to be a Stranger at Home: and with
whomsoever either Nature, Chance, or Choice
has engaged a Man, in any Commerce, he
must endeavour to make himself as acceptable
to these about him, as he possibly can; using
still such a temper in it, that he may not spoil
them by an excessive gentleness, so that his
Servants may not become his Masters. In
such things as I have named to you, do Days,
Months, and Years slip away; what is then
left for Writing? and yet I have said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that time that must go for Sleep,
or for Meat: in which many do waste almost
as much of their time, as in Sleep, which
consumes very near the half of our Life;
and indeed all the time which I can gain to
my self, is that which I steal from my Sleep
and my Meals; and because that is not
much, I have made but a slow progress; yet
because it is somewhat, I have at last got to
an end of my <hi>Utopia,</hi> which I now send to
you, and expect that after you have read it,
you will let me know if you can put me in mind
<pb facs="tcp:53806:10"/>
of any thing that has escaped me; for tho I
would think my self very happy, if I had but
as much Invention and Learning as I know I
have Memory, which makes me generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
much upon it, yet I do not relie so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
on it, as to think I can forget nothing.</p>
            <p>My Servant <hi>John Clement</hi> has started
some things that shake me: You know he was
present with us, as I think he ought to be at
every Conversation that may be of use to him,
for I promise my self great Matters from the
progress he has so early made in the Greek
and Roman Learning. As far as my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
serves me, the Bridg over <hi>Anider</hi> at
<hi>Amaurot,</hi> was 500 paces broad, according
to <hi>Raphael</hi>'s account; but <hi>John</hi> assures me,
he spoke only of 300 paces; therefore I pray
you recollect what you can remember of this,
for if you agree with him, I will believe that
I have been mistaken; but if you remember
nothing of it, I will not alter what I have
written, because it is according to the best of
my remembrance: for as I will take care that
there may be nothing falsly set down; so if
there is any thing doubtful, tho I may perhaps
tell a lie, yet I am sure I will not make one;
for I would rather pass for a good Man,
than for a wise Man: but it will be easy to
correct this Mistake, if you can either meet
<pb facs="tcp:53806:10"/>
with <hi>Raphael</hi> himself, or know how to write
to him.</p>
            <p>I have another Difficulty that presses me
more, and makes your writing to him the
more necessary: I know not whom <hi>I</hi> ought to
blame for it, whether <hi>Raphael,</hi> you, or my self;
for as we did not think of asking it, so neither
did he of telling us, in what part of the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
World <hi>Utopia</hi> is situated; this was
such an omission that <hi>I</hi> would gladly redeem
it at any rate: <hi>I</hi> am ashamed, that after <hi>I</hi>
have told so many things concerning this
Island, <hi>I</hi> cannot let my Readers know in
what Sea it lies. There are some among us
that have a mighty desire to go thither, and
in particular, one pious Divine is very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
on it, not so much out of a vain curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of seeing unknown Countries, as that he
may advance our Religion, which is so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
begun to be planted there; and that he
may do this regularly, he intends to procure
a Mission from the Pope, and to be sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as their Bishop. In such a case as this,
he makes no scruple of aspiring to that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
and thinks it is rather meritorious to
be ambitious of it, when one desires it only
for advancing the Christian Religion, and not
for any Honour or Advantage that may be
had by it, but is acted meerly by a pious Zeal.
<pb facs="tcp:53806:11"/>
Therefore <hi>I</hi> earnestly beg it of you, if you
can possibly meet with <hi>Raphael,</hi> or if you
know how to write to him, that you will be
pleased to inform your self of these things,
that there may be no falshood left in my
Book, nor any important Truth wanting.
And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps it will not be unfit to let him see
the Book it self: for as no Man can correct
any Errors that may be in it, so well as he;
so by reading it, he will be able to give a
more perfect judgment of it than he can do
upon any Discourse concerning it: and you
will be likewise able to discover whether this
Vndertaking of mine is acceptable to him or
not; for if he intends to write a Relation of
his Travels, perhaps he will not be pleased
that <hi>I</hi> should prevent him, in that part that
belongs to the <hi>Utopian Common-Wealth;</hi>
since if <hi>I</hi> should do so, his Book will not
surprize the World with the pleasure which
this new Discovery will give the Age. And
<hi>I</hi> am so little fond of appearing in print up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occasion, that if he dislikes it, <hi>I</hi> will
lay it aside; And even though he should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of it, <hi>I</hi> am not positively determined
as to the publishing of it. Mens tastes differ
much; some are of so morose a Temper, so
sour a Disposition, and make such absurd Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Things, that Men of chearful and
<pb facs="tcp:53806:11"/>
lively Tempers, who indulge their <hi>Genius,</hi>
seem much more happy, than those who waste
their time and strength in order to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
some Book, that tho of it self it
might be useful or pleasant, yet instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well received, will be sure to be either loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
at, or censured. Many know nothing
of Learning, and others despise it: a Man that
is accustomed to a course and harsh Sile,
thinks every thing is rough that is not barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
Our trifling Pretenders to Learning,
think all is slight that is not drest up in
words that are worn out of use; some love only
old things, and many like nothing but what
is their own. Some are so sour, that they can
allow no Iests, and others are so dull that they
can endure nothing that is sharp; and some
are as much afraid of any thing that is quick
or lively, as a Man bit with a mad Dog is
of Water; others are so light and unsetled,
that their Thoughts change as quick as they do
their Postures: and some, when they meet
in Taverns, take upon them among their Cups
to pass Censures very freely on all Writers;
and with a supercilious liberty to condemn
every thing that they do not like: in which they
have the advantage that a bald Man has,
who can catch hold of another by the Hair,
while the other cannot return the like upon
<pb facs="tcp:53806:12"/>
him. They are safe as it were of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot,
since there is nothing in them considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enough to be taken hold of. And some are
so unthankful, that even when they are well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with a Book, yet they think they owe
nothing to the Author; and are like those
rude Guests, who after they have been well
entertained at a good Dinner, go away when
they have glutted their Appetites, without so
much as thanking him that treated them. But
who would put himself to the charge of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Feast for Men of such nice Palats,
and so different Tastes; who are so forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of the Civilities that are done them? But
do you once clear those Points with <hi>Raphael,</hi>
and then it will be time enough to consider
whether it be fit to publish it or not; for
since <hi>I</hi> have been at the pains to write it, if he
consents to the publishing it, <hi>I</hi> will follow my
Friend's Advice, and chiefly yours. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
my dear <hi>Peter,</hi> commend me kindly to
your good Wise, and love me still as you
use to do, for <hi>I</hi> assure you <hi>I</hi> love you daily
more and more.</p>

                  <hi>HENRY</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
King of <hi>England,</hi> a
Prince adorned with all the
Vertues that become a great
Monarch; having some Differences of no
small Consequence with <hi>Charles</hi> the most
serene Prince of <hi>Castile,</hi> sent me into
<hi>Flanders</hi> as his Ambassador, for treating
and composing Matters between them. I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53806:13"/>
was Collegue and Companion to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Man <hi>Cuthbert Tonstal,</hi> whom
the King made lately Master of the <hi>Rolls,</hi>
with such an Universal Applause; of
whom I will say nothing, not because I
fear that the Testimony of a Friend will
be suspected, but rather because his
Learning and Vertues are greater than
that they can be set forth with advantage
by me, and they are so well known, that
they need not my Commendations, unless
I would, according to the Proverb, <hi>Shew
the Sun with a Lanthorn.</hi> Those that were
appointed by the Prince to treat with us,
met us at <hi>Bruges,</hi> according to Agreement:
they were all worthy Men. The <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
of <hi>Bruges</hi> was their Head, and the
chief Man among them; but he that was
esteemed the wisest, and that spoke for
the rest, was <hi>George Temse</hi> the Provost of
<hi>Casselsee;</hi> both Art and Nature had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
to make him eloquent: He was
very learned in the Law; and as he had
a great Capacity, so by a long practice in
Affairs, he was very dextrous at them.
After we had met once and again, and
could not come to an Agreement, they
went to <hi>Brussels</hi> for some days to receive
the Prince's Pleasure. And since our Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53806:13"/>
did admit of it, I went to <hi>Antwerp:</hi>
While I was there, among many that visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me, there was one that was more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to me than any other; <hi>Peter
Giles</hi> born at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> who is a Man of
great Honour, and of a good Rank in
his Town; yet it is not such as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves:
for I do not know if there be
any where to be found a learneder and
a better bred young Man: for as he is
both a very worthy Person, and a very
knowing Man; so he is so civil to all
Men, and yet so particularly kind to his
Friends, and is so full of Candor and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
that there is not perhaps above
one or two to be found any where, that
is in all respects so perfect a Friend as he
is: He is extraordinarily modest, there is
no artifice in him; and yet no Man has
more of a prudent simplicity than he has:
His Conversation was so pleasant and so
innocently chearful, that his Company
did in a great measure lessen any longings
to go back to my Country, and to my
Wife and Children, which an absence of
four months had quickned very much.
One day as I was returning home from
Mass at St. <hi>Maries,</hi> which is the chief
Church, and the most frequented of any in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53806:14"/>
                  <hi>Antwerp,</hi> I saw him by accident talking
with a Stranger, that seemed past the
flower of his Age; his Face was tanned,
he had a long Beard, and his Cloak was
hanging carelesly about him, so that by his
Looks and Habit, I concluded he was a
Seaman. As soon as <hi>Peter</hi> saw me, he came
and saluted me; and as I was returning
his Civility, he took me aside, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him with whom he had been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing,
he said, Do you see that Man?
I was just thinking to bring him to you. I
answered, He should have been very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
on your account: And on his own
too, replied he, if you knew the Man;
for there is none alive that can give you
so copious an account of unknown Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Countries as he can do; which
I know you very much desire. Then
said I, I did not guess amiss, for at first
sight I took him for a Seaman: But you
are much mistaken, said he, for he has
not sailed as a Seaman, but as a Traveller,
or rather as a Philosopher; for this <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael,</hi>
who from his Family carries the
Name of <hi>Hythloday,</hi> as he is not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Latine Tongue, so he is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
learned in the Greek, having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
himself more particularly to that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53806:14"/>
than to the former, because he had given
himself much to Philosophy, in which he
knew that the <hi>Romans</hi> have left us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is valuable, except what is to
be found in <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Cicero.</hi> He is a
<hi>Portuguese</hi> by birth, and was so desirous
of seeing the World, that he divided his
Estate among his Brothers, and run For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
with <hi>Americus Vesputius,</hi> and bore a
share in three of his four Voyages, that
are now published: only he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
with him in his last, but obtained
leave of him almost by force, that he
might be one of those four and twenty
who were left at the farthest place at
which they touched, in their last Voyage
to <hi>New Castile.</hi> The leaving him thus,
did not a little gratify one that was more
fond of travelling than of returning home,
to be buried in his own Country: for he
used often to say, That the way to Heaven
was the same from all places; and he that
had no Grave, had the Heavens still over
him. Yet this disposition of Mind had
cost him dear, if God had not been very
gracious to him; for after he, with five
<hi>Castilians,</hi> had travelled over many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
at last, by a strange good fortune,
he got to <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licut,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53806:15"/>
and there he very happily found
some <hi>Portuguese</hi> Ships; and so, beyond
all Mens expectations, he came back to
his own Country. When <hi>Peter</hi> had said
this to me, I thanked him for his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in intending to give me the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of a Man, whose Conversation he
knew would be so acceptable to me; and
upon that <hi>Raphael</hi> and I embraced one
another: And after those Civilities were
past, which are ordinary for Strangers
upon their first meeting, We went all to
my House, and entring into the Garden,
sat down on a green Bank, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one another in Discourse. He told us,
that when <hi>Vesputius</hi> had sailed away, he
and his Companions that staid behind in
<hi>New-Castile,</hi> did by degrees insinuate
themselves into the People of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
meeting often with them, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them gently: and at last they grew
not only to live among them without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
but to converse familiarly with them;
and got so far into the Heart of a Prince,
whose Name and Country I have forgot,
that he both furnished them plentifully
with all things necessary, and also with
the conveniences of travelling; both
Boats when they went by Water, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53806:15"/>
Wagons when they travelled over Land;
and he sent with them a very faithful
Guide, who was to introduce and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
them to such other Princes as
they had a mind to see: and after many
days Journey, they came to Towns, and
Cities, and to Common-Wealths, that
were both happily governed, and well-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled.
Under the <hi>Aequator,</hi> and as far on
both sides of it as the Sun moves, there
lay vast Deserts that were parched with
the perpetual heat of the Sun; the Soil
was withered, all Things look'd dismally,
and all Places were either quite uninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or abounded with Wild Beasts and
Serpents, and some few Men, that were
neither less wild, nor less cruel than the
Beasts themselves. But as they went far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a new Scene opened, all things grew
milder, the Air less burning, the Soil more
verdant, and even the Beasts were less
wild: And at last there are Nations,
Towns, and Cities, that have not only
mutual commerce among themselves, and
with their Neighbours, but trade both by
Sea and Land, to very remote Countries.
There they found the Conveniencies of
seeing many Countries on all Hands, for
no Ship went any Voyage into which he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53806:16"/>
and his Companions were not very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
The first Vessels that they saw
were Flat-bottomed, their Sails were
made of Reeds and Wicker woven close
together, only some were made of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but afterwards they found Ships
made with round Keels, and Canvass Sails,
and in all things like our Ships: and the
Seamen understood both Astronomy and
Navigation. He got wonderfully into
their favour, by shewing them the use of
the Needle, of which till then they were
utterly ignorant; and whereas they sailed
before with great caution, and only in
Summer-time, now they count all Seasons
alike, trusting wholly to the Loadstone,
in which they are perhaps more secure
than safe; so that there is reason to fear,
that this Discovery which was thought
would prove so much to their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
may by their imprudence become
an occasion of much Mischief to them.
But it were too long to dwell on all that
he told us he had observed in every place,
it would be too great a digression from
our present purpose: and what-ever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be told, chiefly concerning the
wise and prudent Institutions that he
observed among civilized Nations, may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53806:16"/>
perhaps be related by us on a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
occasion. We ask'd him many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
concerning all these things, to which
he answered very willingly; only we
made no enquiries after Monsters, than
which nothing is more common; for
every where one may hear of ravenous
Dogs and Wolves, and cruel Men-eaters;
but it is not so easy to find States that are
well and wisely governed.</p>
               <p>But as he told us of many things that
were amiss in those New-found Nations,
so he reckoned up not a few things, from
which Patterns might be taken for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
the Errors of these Nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom we live; of which an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
may be given, as I have already
promised, at some other time; for at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
I intend only to relate these Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
that he told us of the Manners and
Laws of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians:</hi> but I will begin
with the Occasion that led us to speak of
that Common-Wealth. After <hi>Raphael</hi>
had discoursed with great judgment of the
Errors that were both among us and these
Nations, of which there was no small
number, and had treated of the wise In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
both here and there, and had
spoken as distinctly of the Customs and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53806:17"/>
Government of every Nation through
which he had past, as if he had spent his
whole Life in it; <hi>Peter</hi> being struck with
admiration, said, I wonder, <hi>Raphael,</hi> how
it comes that you enter into no King's
Service, for I am sure there are none to
whom you would not be very acceptable:
for your Learning and Knowledg, both
of Men and Things, is such, that you
would not only entertain them very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly,
but be of good use to them, by
the Examples that you could set before
them, and the Advices that you could
give them; and by this means you would
both serve your own Interest, and be of
great use to all your Friends. As for my
Friends, answered he, I need not be much
concerned, having already done all that
was incumbent on me toward them; for
when I was not only in good Health, but
fresh and young, I distributed that among
my Kindred and Friends, which other
People do not part with till they are old
and sick; and then they unwillingly give
among them, that which they can enjoy no
longer themselves. I think my Friends
ought to rest contented with this, and not
to expect that for their sakes I should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave
my self to any King whatsoever.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53806:17"/>
Soft and fair, said <hi>Peter,</hi> I do not mean
that you should be a Slave to any King,
but only that you should assist them, and
be useful to them. The change of the
Word, said he, does not alter the Matter.
But term it as you will, replied <hi>Peter,</hi> I
do not see any other way in which you
can be so useful, both in private to your
Friends, and to the Publick, and by which
you can make your own Condition hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier.
Happier! answered <hi>Raphael,</hi> is
that to be compassed in a way so abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to my Genius? Now I live as I will,
to which I believe few Courtiers can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend:
and there are so very many that
court the Favour of great Men, that there
will be no great loss, if they are not
troubled either with me, or with others
of my temper. Upon this, I said, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>Raphael</hi> that you neither desire
Wealth nor Greatness; and indeed I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
and admire such a Man much more
than I do any of the great Men in the
World. Yet I think you would do a
thing well-becoming so generous and so
philosophical a Soul as yours is, if you
would apply your Time and Thoughts to
Publick Affairs, even though you may
happen to find that a little uneasy to your
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53806:18"/>
self; and this you can never do with so
much advantage, as by being taken into
the Council of some great Prince, and by
setting him on to noble and worthy
Things, which I know you would do if
you were in such a Post; for the Springs,
both of Good and Evil, flow over a
whole Nation, from the Prince, as from
a lasting Fountain. So much Learning as
you have, even without practice in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
or so great a practice as you have
had, without any other Learning, would
render you a very fit Counsellor to any
King whatsoever, You are doubly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
said he, Mr. <hi>More,</hi> both in your
Opinion of me, and in the Judgment
that you make of things: for as I have
not that Capacity that you fancy to be in
me; so if I had it, the Publick would
not be one jot the better, when I had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
my quiet to it. For most Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
apply themselves more to warlike Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
than to the useful Arts of Peace;
and in these I neither have any knowledg,
nor do I much desire it: They are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
more set on acquiring new King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
right or wrong, than on govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those well that they have: and among
the Ministers of Princes, there are none
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53806:18"/>
that either are not so wise as not to need
any assistance, or at least that do not think
themselves so wise, that they imagine
they need none; and if they do court
any, it is only those for whom the Prince
has much personal Favour, whom by their
Faunings and Flatteries they endeavour
to fix to their own Interests: and indeed
Nature has so made us, that we all love to
be flattered, and to please our selves with
our own Notions. The old Crow loves
his Young, and the Ape his Cubs. Now
if in such a Court, made up of Persons
that envy all others, and do only admire
themselves, one should but propose any
thing that he had either read in History,
or observed in his Travels, the rest would
think that the Reputation of their Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
would sink, and that their Interests
would be much depressed, if they could
not run it down: And if all other things
failed, then they would fly to this, That
such or such things pleased our Ancestors,
and it were well for us if we could but
match them. They would set up their
Rest on such an Answer, as a sufficient
confutation of all that could be said; as
if this were a great Mischief, that any
should be found wiser than his Ancestors:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53806:19"/>
But tho they willingly let go all the good
Things that were among those of former
Ages; yet if better things are proposed,
they cover themselves obstinately with
this excuse, of reverence to past Times.
I have met with these proud, morose, and
absurd Judgments of Things in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
particularly once in <hi>England.</hi> Was
you ever there, said I? Yes, I was, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
he, and staid some months there,
not long after the Rebellion in the West
was suppressed, with a great slaughter of
the poor People that were engaged in
it.</p>
               <p>I was then much obliged to that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Prelate <hi>Iohn Morton</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> Cardinal, and Chancellor of
<hi>England;</hi> a Man, said he, <hi>Peter</hi> (for
Mr. <hi>More</hi> knows well what he was) that
was not less venerable for his Wisdom and
Vertues, than for the high Character he
bore: He was of a middle stature, not
broken with Age; his looks begot Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
rather than Fear; his Conversation
was easy, but serious and grave; he took
pleasure sometimes to try the force of
those that came as Suiters to him upon
Business, by speaking sharply, tho de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
to them, and by that he discovered
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53806:19"/>
their Spirit and presence of Mind; with
which he was much delighted, when it
did not grow up to an impudence, as
bearing a great resemblance to his own
temper; and he look'd on such Persons as
the fittest Men for Affairs. He spoke
both gracefully and weightily; he was
eminently skilled in the Law, and had a
vast Understanding, and a prodigious
Memory: and those excellent Talents
with which Nature had furnished him,
were improved by Study and Experience.
When I was in <hi>England,</hi> the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
much on his Councils, and the
Government seemed to be chiefly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by him; for from his Youth up,
he had been all along practised in Affairs;
and having passed through many Traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Fortune, he had acquired to his
great cost, a vast stock of Wisdom:
which is not soon lost, when it is purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so dear. One day when I was dining
with him, there hapned to be at Table
one of the English Lawyers, who took
occasion to run out in a high commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the severe execution of Justice
upon Thieves, who, as he said, were then
hanged so fast, that there were sometimes
20 on one Gibbet; and upon that he said, he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53806:20"/>
could not wonder enough how it came
to pass, that since so few escaped, there
were yet so many Thieves left who were
still robbing in all places. Upon this, I
who took the boldness to speak freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Cardinal, said, There was no
reason to wonder at the Matter, since
this way of punishing Thieves, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
just in it Self, nor good for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
for as the Severity was too great,
so the Remedy was not effectual; simple
Theft not being so great a Crime, that it
ought to cost a Man his Life; and no Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
how severe soever, being able
to restrain those from robbing, who can
find out no other way of livelihood; and
in this, said I, not only you in <hi>England,</hi>
but a great part of the World, imitate
some ill Masters, that are readier to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
their Scholars, than to teach them.
There are dreadful Punishments enacted
against Thieves, but it were much better
to make such good Provisions, by which
every Man might be put in a Method how
to live, and so be preserved from the fatal
necessity of stealing, and of dying for it.
There has been care enough taken for
that, said he, there are many Handycrafts,
and there is Husbandry, by which they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53806:20"/>
may make a shift to live, unless they have a
greater mind to follow ill Courses. That
will not serve your turn, said I, for many
lose their Limbs in Civil or Forreign
Wars, as lately in the <hi>Cornish</hi> Rebellion,
and some time ago in your Wars with
<hi>France,</hi> who being thus mutilated in the
Service of their King and Country, can
no more follow their old Trades, and are
too old to learn new Ones: But since
Wars are only accidental Things, and
have Intervals, let us consider those Things
that fall out every day. There is a great
number of Noble Men among you, that
live not only idle themselves as Drones,
subsisting by other Mens Labours, who
are their Tenants, and whom they pare to
the quick, and thereby raise their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues;
this being the only instance of their
Frugality, for in all other things they are
Prodigal, even to the beggering of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
But besides this, they carry about
with them a huge number of idle Fellows,
who never learn'd any Art by which they
may gain their Living; and these, as
soon as either their Lord dies, or they
themselves fall sick, are turned out of
Doors; for your Lords are readier to
feed idle People, than to take care of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53806:21"/>
sick; and often the Heir is not able to
keep together so great a Family as his
Predecessor did: Now when the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs
of those that are thus turned out
of Doors, grow keen, they rob no less
keenly; and what else can they do? for
after that, by wandring about, they have
worn out both their Health and their
Cloaths, and are tattered, and look ghast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Men of Quality will not entertain
them, and poor Men dare not do it;
knowing that one who has been bred up
in Idleness and Pleasure, and who was used
to walk about with his Sword and Buckler,
despising all the Neighbourhood with an
insolent Scorn, as far below him, is not
fit for the Spade and Mattock: Nor will
he serve a poor Man for so small a Hire,
and in so low a Diet as he can afford. To
this he answered, This sort of Men ought
to be particularly cherished among us, for
in them consists the Force of the Armies
for which we may have occasion; since
their Birth inspires them with a nobler
sence of Honour, than is to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Tradesmen or Ploughmen. You
may as well say, replied I, that you must
cherish Thieves on the account of Wars,
for you will never want the one, as long
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53806:21"/>
as you have the other; and as Robbers
prove sometimes gallant Souldiers, so Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
prove often brave Robbers; so near
an Alliance there is between those two
sorts of Life. But this bad custom of
keeping many Servants, that is so common
among you, is not peculiar to this Nation.
In <hi>France</hi> there is yet a more pestiferous
sort of People, for the whole Country is
full of Souldiers, that are still kept up in
time of Peace; if such a state of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can be called a Peace: and these are
kept in Pay upon the same account that
you plead for those Idle Retainers about
Noble Men: this being a Maxim of those
pretended Statesmen, That it is necessary
for the Publick Safety, to have a good
Body of Veteran Souldiers ever in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
They think raw Men are not to be
depended on, and they sometimes seek
Occasions for making War, that they may
train up their Souldiers in the Art of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Throats, or as <hi>Salust</hi> observed, for
keeping their Hands in use, that they may
not grow dull by too long an intermission.
But <hi>France</hi> has learn'd, to its cost, how
dangerous it is to feed such Beasts. The
Fate of the <hi>Romans, Carthaginians,</hi>
and <hi>Syrians,</hi> and many other Nations,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53806:22"/>
and Cities, which were both overturned,
and quite ruined by those standing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
should make others wiser: and the
folly of this Maxim of the <hi>French,</hi> appears
plainly even from this, that their trained
Souldiers find your raw Men prove often
too hard for them; of which I will not
say much, lest you may think I flatter the
English Nation. Every day's Experience
shews, that the Mechanicks in the Towns,
or the Clowns in the Country, are not
afraid of fighting with those idle Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
if they are not disabled by some
Misfortune in their Body, or dispirited by
extream Want. So that you need not
fear, that those well-shaped and strong
Men, (for it is only such that Noblemen
love to keep about them, till they spoil
them) who now grow feeble with ease,
and are softned with their effeminate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Life, would be less fit for Action
if they were well bred and well employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And it seems very unreasonable, that
for the prospect of a War, which you
need never have but when you please,
you should maintain so many idle Men, as
will always disturb you in time of Peace,
which is ever to be more considered than
War. But I do not think that this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53806:22"/>
of Stealing, arises only from hence,
there is another Cause of it that is more
peculiar to <hi>England.</hi> What is that? said
the Cardinal: The encrease of Pasture,
said I, by which your Sheep, that are
naturally mild, and easily kept in order,
may be said now to devour Men, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people,
not only Villages, but Towns:
For where-ever it is found, that the Sheep
of any Soil yield a softer and richer Wool
than ordinary, there the Nobility and
Gentry, and even those Holy Men the
Abbots, not contented with the old
Rents which their Farms yielded, nor
thinking it enough that they living at
their ease, do no good to the Publick, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to do it Hurt instead of Good. They
stop the course of Agriculture, inclose
Grounds, and destroy Houses and Towns,
reserving only the Churches, that they
may lodg their Sheep in them: And as if
Forrests and Parks had swallowed up too
little Soil, those worthy Country-Men
turn the best inhabited Places into Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes;
for when any unsatiable Wretch,
who is a Plague to this Country, resolves
to inclose many thousand Acres of Ground,
the Owners, as well as Tenants, are turned
out of their Possessions, by Tricks, or by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53806:23"/>
main Force, or being wearied out with ill
Usage, they are forced to sell them. So
those miserable People, both Men and
Women, Married, Unmarried, Old and
Young, with their Poor, but numerous
Families, (since Country-Business requires
many Hands) are all forced to change
their Seats, not knowing whither to go;
and they must sell for almost nothing, their
Houshold-stuff, which could not bring
them much Mony, even tho they might
stay for a Buyer: when that little Mony
is at an end, for it will be soon spent;
what is left for them to do, but either to
steal, and so to be hanged, (God knows
how justly) or to go about and beg?
And if they do this, they are put in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as idle Vagabonds; whereas they
would willingly work, but can find none
that will hire them; for there is no more
occasion for Country Labour, to which
they have been bred, when there is no
Arable Ground left. One Shepherd can
look after a Flock, which will stock an
extent of Ground that would require ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hands, if it were to be ploughed and
reaped. This likewise raises the price of
Corn in many places. The price of Wool
is also so risen, that the poor People who
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53806:23"/>
were wont to make Cloth, are no more
able to buy it; and this likewise makes
many of them idle: For since the increase
of Pasture, God has punished the Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
of the Owners, by a Rot among the
Sheep, which has destroyed vast numbers
of them, but had been more justly laid
upon the Owners themselves. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Sheep should encrease ever so
much, their Price is not like to fall; since
tho they cannot be called a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not engrossed by one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
yet they are in so few hands, and
these are so rich, that as they are not
prest to sell them sooner than they have a
mind to it, so they never do it till they
have raised the Price as high as is possible.
And on the same account it is, that the
other kinds of Cattel are so dear, and so
much the more, because that many Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
being pulled down, and all Country-Labour
being much neglected, there are
none that look after the breeding of them.
The Rich do not breed Cattel as they do
Sheep, but buy them Lean, and at low
Prices; and after they have fatned them
on their Grounds, they sell them again at
high rates. And I do not think that all
the Inconveniences that this will produce,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53806:24"/>
are yet observed; for as they sell the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
dear, so if they are consumed faster
then the breeding Countries from which
they are brought, can afford them; then
the stock most decrease, and this must
needs end in a great Scarcity; and by
these means this your Island, that seemed
as to this particular, the happiest in the
World, will suffer much by the cursed
Avarice of a few Persons; besides that,
the rising of Corn makes all People lessen
their Families as much as they can; and
what can those who are dismissed by them
do, but either Beg or Rob? And to this
last, a Man of a great Mind is much sooner
drawn than to the former. Luxury like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
breaks in apace upon you, to set
forward your Poverty and Misery; there
is an excessive Vanity in Apparel, and
great Cost in Diet; and that not only in
Noblemens Families, but even among
Tradesmen, and among the Farmers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and among all Ranks of Persons.
You have also many infamous Houses, and
besides those that are known, the Taverns
and Alehouses are no better; add to these,
Dice, Cards, Tables, Football, Tennis, and
Coits, in which Mony runs fast away; and
those that are initiated into them, must in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53806:24"/>
conclusion betake themselves to robbing
for a supply. Banish those Plagues, and
give order that these who have dispeopled
so much Soil, may either rebuild the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
that they have pulled down, or
let out their Grounds to such as will do
it: Restrain those engrossings of the
Rich, that are as bad almost as <hi>Monopolies;</hi>
leave fewer Occasions to Idleness; let A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture
be set up again, and the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture
of the Wooll be regulated, that
so there may be Work found for these
Companies of Idle People, whom want
Forces to be Thieves, or who now being
idle Vagabonds, or useless Servants, will
certainly grow Thieves at last. If you
do not find a Remedy to these Evils, it is
a vain thing to boast of your Severity of
punishing Theft; which tho it may have
the appearance of Justice, yet in it self it
is neither just nor convenient: for if you
suffer your People to be ill Educated, and
their Manners to be corrupted from their
Infancy, and then punish them for those
Crimes to which their first Education dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
them, what else is to be concluded
from this, but that you first make Thieves,
and then punish them?</p>

allow of it; upon the same Grounds,
Laws may be made to allow of Adultery
and Perjury in some Cases: for God
having taken from us the Right of dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
either of our own, or of other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Lives, if it is pretended that the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Consent of Men in making Laws, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of Manslaughter in Cases in which
God has given us no Example, frees Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from the Obligation of the Divine
Law, and so makes Murder a lawful Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
What is this, but to give a prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Humane Laws before the Divine?
And if this is once admitted, by the same
Rule Men may in all other things put what
Restrictions they please upon the Laws
of God. If by the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law, tho it
was rough and severe, as being a Yoke
laid on an obstinate and servile Nation,
Men were only fined, and not put to
death for Theft; we cannot imagine that
in this new Law of Mercy, in which God
treats us with the tenderness of a Father,
he has given us a greater License to Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than he did to the <hi>Iews.</hi> Upon these
Reasons it is, that I think the putting
Thieves to death is not lawful; and it is
plain and obvious that it is absurd, and of
ill Consequence to the Common-Wealth,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53806:25"/>
that a Thief and a Murderer should be
equally punished: for if a Robber sees
that his Danger is the same, if he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
of Theft, as if he were guilty of
Murder, this will naturally set him on to
kill the Person whom otherwise he would
only have robbed, since if the Punishment
is the same, there is more security, and less
danger of discovery, when he that can
best make it is put out of the way; so that
the terrifying Thieves too much, provokes
them to cruelty.</p>
               <p>But as to the Question, What more
convenient way of Punishment can be
found? I think it is much easier to find out
that, than to invent any thing that is
worse; Why should we doubt but the
way that was so long in use among the
old <hi>Romans,</hi> who understood so well the
Arts of Government, was very proper
for their Punishment? they condemned
such as they found guilty of great Crimes,
to work their whole Lives in Quarries,
or to dig in Mines with Chains about
them. But the Method that I liked best,
was that which I observed in my Travels
in <hi>Persia,</hi> among the <hi>Polylerits,</hi> who are a
considerable and well-governed People.
They pay a yearly Tribute to the King
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53806:26"/>
of <hi>Persia;</hi> but in all other respects they
are a free Nation, and governed by their
own Laws. They lie far from the Sea,
and are environed with Hills; and being
contented with the Productions of their
own Country, which is very fruitful,
they have little commerce with any other
Nation; and as they, according to the
Genius of their Country, have no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
of inlarging their Borders; so their
Mountains, and the Pension that they pay
to the <hi>Persian,</hi> secure them from all Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
Thus they have no Wars among
them; they live rather conveniently than
splendidly, and may be rather called a
Happy Nation, than either Eminent or
Famous; for I do not think that they are
known so much as by Name to any but
their next Neighbours. Those that are
found guilty of Theft among them, are
bound to make restitution to the Owner,
and not as it is in other places, to the
Prince, for they reckon that the Prince
has no more right to the stollen Goods
than the Thief; but if that which was
stollen is no more in being, then the
Goods of the Thieves are estimated, and
Restitution being made out of them, the
Remainder is given to their Wives, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53806:26"/>
Children: And they themselves are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to serve in the Publick Works, but
are neither imprisoned, nor chained, unless
there hapned to be some extraordinary
Circumstances in their Crimes. They go
about loose and free, working for the
Publick: If they are Idle or backward to
work, they are whipp'd; but if they
work hard, they are well used and treated
without any mark of Reproach, only
the Lists of them are called always at
Night, and then they are shut up, and
they suffer no other uneasiness, but this of
constant Labour; for as they work for
the Publick, so they are well entertained
out of the Publick Stock, which is done
differently in different places: In some
places, that which is bestowed on them,
is raised by a charitable Contribution; and
tho this way may seem uncertain, yet so
merciful are the Inclinations of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that they are plentifully supplied by
it; but in other places Publick Revenues
are set aside for them; or there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Tax of a Poll-mony raised for their
Maintenance. In some places they are set
to no Publick Work, but every privat
Man that has occasion to hire Workmen,
goes to the Market-places and hires them
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53806:27"/>
of the Publick, a little lower than he would
do a Free-man: If they go lazily about
their Task, he may quicken them with
the Whip. By this means there is always
some piece of Work or other to be done
by them; and beside their Livelyhood,
they earn somewhat still to the Publick.
They wear all a peculiar Habit, of one
certain colour, and their Hair is cropt a
little above their Ears, and a little of one
of their Ears is cut off. Their Friends
are allowed to give them either Meat,
Drink, or Clothes, so they are of their
proper Colour; but it is Death, both to
the Giver and Taker, if they give them
Mony; nor is it less penal for any Free-man
to take Mony from them, upon any
account whatsoever: And it is also Death
for any of these <hi>Slaves</hi> (so they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
to handle Arms. Those of every
Division of the Country, are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a peculiar Mark: And it is capital
to lay that aside, and so it is also to go
out of their Bounds, or to talk with a
Slave of another Jurisdiction; and the
very attempt of an escape, is no less penal
than an escape it self; it is Death for any
other Slave to be accessary to it: If a Free-man
engages in it, he is condemned to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53806:27"/>
slavery: Those that discover it are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded;
if Free-men, in Mony; and if
Slaves, with Liberty, together with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for being accessary to it; that so they
may find their Account, rather in repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their accession to such a design, than
in persisting in it.</p>
               <p>These are their Laws and Rules in this
Matter; in which both the Gentleness
and the Advantages of them are very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious;
since by these Means, as Vices are
destroyed, so Men are preserved; but are
so treated, that they see the necessity of
being good: and by the rest of their Life
they make reparation for the Mischief they
had formerly done. Nor is there any
hazard of their falling back to their old
Customs: And so little do Travellers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
Mischief from them, that they
generally make use of them for Guides,
from one Jurisdiction to another; for
there is nothing left them by which they
can rob, or be the better for it, since as
they are disarmed, so the very having of
Mony is a sufficient Conviction: and as
they are certainly punished if discovered,
so they cannot hope to escape: for their
Habit being in all the parts of it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53806:28"/>
from what is commonly worn,
they cannot fly away, unless they should
go naked, and even then their crop'd
Ear would betray them. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
danger to be feared from them, is their
conspiring against the Government: but
those of one Division and Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
can do nothing to any purpose, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
a general Conspiracy were laid amongst
all the Slaves of the several Jurisdictions,
which cannot be done, since they cannot
meet or talk together; nor will any ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on a Design where the Concealment
would be so dangerous, and the Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
so profitable: and none of them is
quite hopeless of recovering his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
since by their Obedience and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and by giving grounds to believe
that they will change their manner of Life
for the future, they may expect at last to
obtain their Liberty: and some are every
Year restored to it, upon the good Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
that is given of them. When I
had related all this, I added, That I did
not see why such a Method might not be
followed with more advantage, than could
ever be expected from that severe Justice
which the Counsellor magnified so much.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53806:28"/>
To all this he answered, That it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be so setled in <hi>England,</hi> without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering
the whole Nation by it; and
as he said that, he shook his Head, and
made some grimaces, and so held his peace;
and all the Company seemed to be of his
mind: only the Cardinal said, It is not
easy to guess whether it would succeed
well or ill, since no trial has been made
of it: But if when the Sentence of Death
were past upon a Thief, the Prince would
reprieve him for a while, and make the
Experiment upon him, denying him the
privilege of a Sanctuary; then if it had
a good effect upon him, it might take
place; and if it succeeded not, the worst
would be, to execute the Sentence on
the condemned Persons at last. And I do not
see, said he, why it would be either injust
or inconvenient, or at all dangerous, to
admit of such a delay: And I think the
Vagabonds ought to be treated in the
same manner, against whom tho we have
made many Laws, yet we have not been
able to gain our end by them all. When
the Cardinal had said this, then they all
fell to commend the Motion, tho they
had despised it when it came from me;
but they did more particularly commend
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53806:29"/>
that concerning the Vagabonds, because
it had been added by him.</p>
               <p>I do not know whether it be worth the
while to tell what followed, for it was
very ridiculous; but I shall venture at it,
for as it is not forreign to this Matter, so
some good use may be made of it. There
was a Jester standing by, that counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Fool so naturally, that he seemed
to be really one. The Jests at which he
offered were so cold and dull, that we
laughed more at him than at them; yet
sometimes he said, as it were by chance,
things that were not unpleasant; so as to
justify the old Proverb, <hi>That he who throws
the Dice often, will sometimes have a lucky
Hit.</hi> When one of the Company had
said, that I had taken care of the Thieves,
and the Cardinal had taken care of the
Vagabonds, so that there remained nothing
but that some publick Provision might be
made for the Poor, whom Sickness or
Old Age had disabled from Labour: Leave
that to me, said the Fool, and I shall take
care of them; for there is no sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whose sight I abhor more, having been
so often vexed with them, and with their
sad Complaints; but as dolefully soeveras
they have told their Tale to me, they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53806:29"/>
could never prevail so far as to draw one
Penny of Mony from me: for either I
had no mind to give them any thing, or
when I had a mind to it, I had nothing
to give them: and they now know me so
well, that they will not lose their labour
on me, but let me pass without giving me
any trouble, because they hope for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from me, no more in faith than if I
were a <hi>Priest:</hi> But I would have a Law
made, for sending all these Beggars to
Monasteries, the Men to the <hi>Benedictines</hi>
to be Lay-Brothers, and the Women to be
Nuns. The Cardinal smiled, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of it in jest; but the rest liked it
in earnest. There was a Divine present,
who tho he was a grave morose Man, yet
he was so pleased with this Reflection that
was made on the Priests and the Monks,
that he began to play with the Fool, and
said to him, This will not deliver you
from all Beggers, except you take care of
us <hi>Friars.</hi> That is done already, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the Fool, for the Cardinal has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for you, by what he proposed for
the restraining Vagabonds, and setting
them to work, for I know no Vagabonds
like you. This was well entertained by
the whole Company, who looking at
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53806:30"/>
the Cardinal, perceived that he was not
ill pleased at it; only the Friar himself
was so bit, as may be easily imagined, and
fell out into such a passion, that he could not
forbear railing at the Fool, and called him
<hi>Knave, Slanderer, Backbiter,</hi> and <hi>Son of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and cited some dreadful Threatnings
out of the Scriptures against him. Now
the Jester thought he was in his Element,
and laid about him freely: he said, Good
Friar be not angry, for it is written, <hi>In
patience possess your Soul.</hi> The Friar an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
(for I shall give you his own
words) I am not angry, you Hangman;
at least I do not sin in it, for the Psalmist
says, <hi>Be ye angry, and sin not.</hi> Upon
this the Cardinal admonished him gently,
and wished him to govern his Passions.
No, my Lord, said he, I speak not but
from a good Zeal, which I ought to have;
for Holy Men have had a good Zeal, as it is
said, <hi>The Zeal of thy House hath eaten me
up;</hi> and we sing in our Church, that those
who mock'd <hi>Elisha</hi> as he went up to the
House of God, felt the Effects of his
Zeal; which that Mocker, that Rogue,
that Scoundrel, will perhaps feel. You do
this perhaps with a goodintention, said the
Cardinal; but in my Opinion, it were
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53806:30"/>
wiser in you, not to say better for you,
not to engage in so ridiculous a Contest
with a Fool. No, my Lord, answered
he, that were not wisely done; for <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
the wisest of Men, said, <hi>Answer a
Fool according to his folly;</hi> which I now
do, and shew him the Ditch into which
he will fall, if he is not aware of it; for
if the many Mockers of <hi>Elisha,</hi> who was
but one bald Man, felt the Effect of his
Zeal, What will become of one Mocker
of so many Friars, among whom there
are so many bald Men? We have likewise
a Bull, by which all that jeer us are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.
When the Cardinal saw
that there was no end of this Matter, he
made a sign to the Fool to withdraw, and
turned the Discourse another way; and
soon after he rose from the Table, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missing
us, he went to hear Causes.</p>
               <p>Thus, Mr. <hi>More,</hi> I have run out into a
tedious Story, of the length of which I
had been ashamed, if, as you earnestly
begged it of me, I had not observed you
to hearken to it, as if you had no mind
to lose any part of it: I might have
contracted it, but I resolved to give
it you at large, that you might observe
how those that had despised what I had
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53806:31"/>
proposed, no sooner perceived that the
Cardinal did not dislike it, but they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
approved of it, and fawned so on
him, and flattered him to such a degree,
that they in good earnest applauded those
things that he only liked in jest. And
from hence you may gather, how little
Courtiers would value either me or my
Counsels.</p>
               <p>To this I answered, You have done me
a great kindness in this Relation; for as
every thing has been related by you, both
wisely and pleasantly, so you have made
me imagine, that I was in my own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and grown young again, by recalling
that good Cardinal into my thoughts, in
whose Family I was bred from my Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
And tho you are upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
very dear to me, yet you are the
dearer, because you honour his Memory
so much: but after all this I cannot change
my Opinion, for I still think that if you
could overcome that aversion which you
have to the Courts of Princes, you might
do a great deal of good to Mankind, by
the Advices that you would give; and
this is the chief Design that every good
Man ought to propose to himself in living:
for whereas your Friend <hi>Plato</hi> thinks that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53806:31"/>
then Nations will be happy, when either
Philosophers become Kings, or Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Philosophers. No wonder if we are so
far from that Happiness, if Philosophers
will not think it fit for them to assist
Kings with their Councels. They are not
so base minded, said he, but that they
would willingly do it: many of them
have already done it by their Books, if
these that are in Power would hearken to
their good Advices. But <hi>Plato</hi> judged
right, that except Kings themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Philosophers, it could never be
brought about, that they who from their
Childhood are corrupted with false No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
should fall in intirely with the
Counsels of Philosophers, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
found to be true in the Person of
<hi>Dionysius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do not you think, that if I were about
any King, and were proposing good Laws
to him, and endeavouring to root out of
him all the cursed Seeds of Evil that I
found in him, I should either be turned
out of his Court, or at least be laughed at
for my pains? For Instance, What could I
signify if I were about the King of <hi>France,</hi>
and were called into his Cabinet-Council,
where several wise Men do in his hearing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53806:32"/>
propose many Expedients; as by what
Arts and Practices <hi>Milan</hi> may be kept;
and <hi>Naples,</hi> that has so oft slip'd out of
their hands, recovered; and how the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> and after them the rest of <hi>Italy</hi>
may be subdued; and then how <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Brabant,</hi> and all <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and some
other Kingdoms which he has swallowed
already in his Designs, may be added to
his Empire. One proposes a League with
the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to be kept as long as he
finds his account in it, and that he ought
to communicate Councils with them, and
give them some share of the Spoil, till his
Success makes him need or fear them less,
and then it will be easily taken out of
their Hands. Another proposes the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Germans,</hi> and the securing the
<hi>Switzers</hi> by Pensions. Another proposes
the gaining the Emperor by Mony, which
is Omnipotent with him. Another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
a Peace with the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi>
and in order to the cementing it, the
yielding up the King of <hi>Navar</hi>'s Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Another thinks the Prince of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile</hi>
is to be wrought on, by the hope of
an Alliance; and that some of his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
are to be gained to the French Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by Pensions. The hardest Point
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53806:32"/>
of all is, what to do with <hi>England:</hi> a
Treaty of Peace is to be set on foot, and
if their Alliance is not to be depended
on, yet it is to be made as firm as can be;
and they are to be called Friends, but
suspected as Enemies: Therefore the Scots
are to be kept in readiness, to be let loose
upon <hi>England</hi> on every occasion; and
some banished Nobleman is to be suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
underhand, (for by the League it
cannot be done avowedly) who has a
pretension to the Crown, by which means
that suspected Prince may be kept in awe.
Now when things are in so great a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
and so many gallant Men are
joining Councils, how to carry on the
War, if so mean a Man as I am should
stand up, and wish them to change all
their Councils, to let <hi>Italy</hi> alone, and stay
at home, since the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>
was indeed greater than that it could be
well governed by one Man; So that he
ought not to think of adding others to
it: And if after this, I should propose to
them the Resolutions of the <hi>Achorians,</hi> a
People that lie over against the Isle of
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia</hi> to the South-east, who having
long ago engaged in a War, that they
might gain another Kingdom to their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53806:33"/>
King, who had a Pretension to it by an
old Alliance, by which it had descended
to him; and having conquered it, when
they found that the trouble of keeping it,
was equal to that of gaining it; for the
conquered People would be still apt to
rebel, or be exposed to Forreign Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so that they must always be in War,
either for them, or against them; and that
therefore they could never disband their
Army: That in the mean time Taxes lay
heavy on them, that Mony went out of
the Kingdom; that their Blood was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
to their King's <hi>Glory,</hi> and that they
were nothing the better by it, even in
time of Peace; their Manners being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by a long War; Robbing and
Murders abounding every where, and
their Laws falling under contempt, because
their King being distracted with the Cares
of the Kingdom, was less able to apply
his Mind to any one of them; when they
saw there would be no end of those Evils,
they by joint Councils made an humble
Address to their King, desiring him to
chuse which of the two Kingdoms he had
the greatest mind to keep, since he could
not hold both; for they were too great a
People to be governed by a divided King,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53806:33"/>
since no Man would willingly have a
Groom that should be in common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and another. Upon which the
good Prince was forced to quit his new
Kingdom to one of his Friends, (who
was not long after dethroned) and to be
contented with his old One. To all this
I would add, that after all those Warlike
Attempts, and the vast Confusions, with
the Consumptions both of Treasure and
of People, that must follow them; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
upon some Misfortune, they might
be forced to throw up all at last; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it seemed much more eligible that the
King should improve his ancient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
all he could, and make it flourish as
much as was possible; that he should
love his People, and be beloved of them;
that he should live among them, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
them gently; and that he should let
other Kingdoms alone, since that which
had fallen to his share was big enough, if
not too big for him. Pray how do you
think would such a Speech as this be
heard? I confess, said I, I think not very
well.</p>
               <p>But what said he, if I should sort with
another kind of Ministers, whose chief
Contrivances and Consultations were, by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53806:34"/>
what Art Treasure might be heaped up?
Where one proposes, the crying up of
Mony, when the King had a great Debt
on him, and the crying it down as much
when his Revenues were to come in, that
so he might both pay much with a little,
and in a little receive a great deal: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proposes a pretence of a War, that
so Money might be raised in order to the
carrying it on, and that a Peace might be
concluded as soon as that was done; and
this was to be made up with such appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of Religion as might work on the
People, and make them impute it to the
piety of their Prince, and to his tenderness
of the Lives of his Subjects. A third offers
some old musty Laws, that have been
antiquated by a long disuse; and which,
as they had been forgotten by all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
so they had been also broken by
them; and that the levying of the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of these Laws, as it would bring in a
vast Treasure, so there might be a very
good Pretence for it, since it would look
like the executing of Law, and the doing
of Justice. A fourth proposes the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
of many things under severe Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
especially such things as were against
the Interest of the People, and then the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53806:34"/>
dispensing with these Prohibitions upon
great Compositions, to those who might
make Advantages by breaking them. This
would serve two ends, both of them accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to many; for as those whose Avarice
led them to transgress, would be severely
fined; so the selling Licences dear, would
look as if a Prince were tender of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and would not easily, or at low Rates,
dispense with any thing that might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Publick Good. Another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
that the Judges must be made sure,
that they may declare always in favor of
the Prerogative, that they must be often
sent for to Court, that the King may hear
them argue those Points in which he is
concerned; since that how unjust soever
any of his Pretensions may be, yet still
some one or other of them, either out of
contradiction to others, or the pride of
singularity, or that they may make
their Court, would find out some Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
or other to give the King a fair co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to carry the Point: For if the Judges
but differ in Opinion, the clearest thing
in the World is made by that means dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable,
and Truth being once brought in
question, the King upon that may take
advantage to expound the Law for his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53806:35"/>
own profit: the Judges that stand out
will be brought over, either out of fear or
modesty; and they being thus gained, all
of them may be sent to the Bench to give
Sentence boldly, as the King would have it:
for fair Pretences will never be wanting
when Sentence is to be given in the
Prince's Favor: it will either be said, that
Equity lies of his side, or some words in
the Law will be found sounding that way,
or some forced sence will be put on them;
and when all other things fail, the King's
undoubted Prerogative will be pretended,
as that which is above all Law; and to
which a Religious Judg ought to have
a special regard. Thus all consent to that
Maxim of <hi>Grassus,</hi> That a Prince cannot
have Treasure enough, since he must main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Armies out of it: that a King,
even tho he would, can do nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly;
that all Property is in him, not
excepting the very Persons of his Subjects:
And that no Man has any other Property,
but that which the King out of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thinks fit to leave him: and they
think it is the Prince's Interest, that there
be as little of this left as may be, as if it
were his advantage that his People should
have neither Riches nor Liberty; since
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53806:35"/>
these things make them less easy and tame
to a cruel and injust Government; whereas
Necessity and Poverty blunts them,
makes them patient, and bears them down,
and breaks that height of Spirit, that might
otherwise dispose them to rebel. Now
what if after all these Propositions
were made, I should rise up and assert,
That such Councels were both unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a King, and mischievous to him: and
that not only his Honor but his Safety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
more in his Peoples Wealth, than
in his own; if I should shew, that they
choose a King for their own sake, and not
for his; that by his care and endeavors
they may be both easy and safe: and that
therefore a Prince ought to take more care
of his Peoples Happiness, than of his own,
as a Shepherd is to take more care of his
Flock than of himself. It is also certain,
that they are much mistaken, that think
the Poverty of a Nation is a means of the
Publick Safety: Who quarrel more than
Beggers do? who does more earnestly
long for a change, than he that is uneasy
in his present Circumstances? and who
run in to create Confusions with so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
a boldness, as those who having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to lose, hope to gain by them? If
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53806:36"/>
a King should fall under so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
or envy, that he could not keep
his Subjects in their Duty, but by Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and ill Usage, and by impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
them, it were certainly better for
him to quit his Kingdom, than to retain
it by such Methods, by which tho he
keeps the Name of Authority, yet he
loses the Majesty due to it. Nor is it so
becoming the Dignity of a King to reign
over Beggars, as to reign over rich and
happy Subjects. And therefore <hi>Fabritius,</hi>
that was a Man of a noble and exalted
Temper, said, He would rather govern
rich Men, than be rich himself; and for
one Man to abound in Wealth and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
when all about him are mourning
and groaning, is to be a Goaler and not a
King. He is an unskilful Physician, that
cannot cure a Disease, but by casting his
Patient into another: So he that can find
no other way for correcting the Errors of
his People, but by taking from them the
Conveniences of Life, shews that he knows
not what it is to govern a free Nation.
He himself ought rather to shake off his
Sloth, or to lay down his Pride; for the
Contempt or Hatred that his People have
for him, takes its rise from the Vices in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53806:36"/>
himself. Let him live upon what belongs
to himself, without wronging others, and
accommodate his Expence to his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.
Let him punish Crimes, and by his
wise Conduct let him endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them, rather than be severe when he
has suffered them to be too common: Let
him not rashly revive Laws that are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated
by disuse, especially if they have
been long forgotten, and never wanted.
And let him never take any Penalty for
the breach of them, to which a Judg
would not give way in a private Man, but
would look on him as a crafty and unjust
Person for pretending to it. To these
things I would add, that Law among the
<hi>Macarians,</hi> that lie not far from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi>
by which their King, in the day on which
he begins to reign, is tied by an Oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by solemn Sacrifices, never to have
at once above a thousand Pounds of
Gold in his Treasures, or so much Silver
as is equal to that in value. This Law, as
they say, was made by an excellent King,
who had more regard to the Riches of his
Country, than to his own Wealth; and
so provided against the heaping up of so
much Treasure, as might impoverish the
People: he thought that moderate Sum
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53806:37"/>
might be sufficient for any Accident; if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King had occasion for it against
Rebels, or the Kingdom against the Invasion
of an Enemy, but that it was not enough to
encourage a Prince to invade other Mens
Rights, which was the chief cause of his
making that Law. He also thought, that
it was a good Provision for a free circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mony, that is necessary for the
course of Commerce and Exchange: And
when a King must distribute all these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Accessions that encrease Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
beyond the due pitch, it makes him
less disposed to oppress his Subjects. Such
a King as this is, will be the terror of ill
Men, and will be beloved of all good Men.</p>
               <p>If, I say, I should talk of these or such
like things, to Men that had taken their
biass another way, how deaf would they
be to it all? No doubt, very deaf, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
I; and no wonder, for one is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to offer at Propositions or Advices,
that he is certain will not be entertained.
Discourses so much out of the road could
not avail any thing, nor have any effect
on Men, whose Minds were prepossessed
with different Sentiments. This Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
way of Speculation, is not unpleasant
among Friends in a free Converrsation;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53806:37"/>
but there is no room for it in the Courts
of Princes, where great Affairs are carried
on by Authority. That is what I was
saying, replied he, that there is no room
for Philosophy in the Courts of Princes.
Yes, there is, said I, but not for this Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
Philosophy, that makes every
thing to be alike fitting at all times: But
there is another Philosophy that is more
pliable, that knows its proper Scene, and
accommodates it self to it; and that
teaches a Man to act that part which has
fallen to his share, fitly and decently. If
when one of <hi>Plautus</hi>'s Comedies is upon
the Stage, and a Company of Servants
are acting their parts, you should come
out in the Garb of a Philosopher, and
repeat out of <hi>Octavia,</hi> a Discourse of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>'s
to <hi>Nero,</hi> had it not been better for
you to have said nothing, than by mixing
things of such different Natures, to have
made such an impertinent Tragi-Comedy?
for you spoil and corrupt the Play that is
in hand, when you mix with it things dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing
to it, even tho they were better
than it is: therefore go through with the
Play that is acting, the best you can; and
do not confound it, because another that
is pleasanter comes into your thoughts. It
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53806:38"/>
is even so in a Common-Wealth, and in
the Councils of Princes; if ill Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
cannot be quite rooted out; and if
you cannot cure some received Vices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your wishes, you must not
therefore abandon the Common-Wealth;
or forsake the Ship in a Storm, because you
cannot command the Winds; nor ought
you to assault People with Discourses that
are out of their Road, when you see
their Notions are such that you can make
no impression on them: but you ought
to cast about, and as far as you can to
manage things dextrously, that so if you
cannot make Matters go well, they may
be as little ill as is possible; for except all
Men were good, all things cannot go
well; which I do not hope to see in a
great while. By this, answered he, all
that I shall do shall be to preserve my
self from being mad, while I endeavour
to cure the madness of other People: for
if I will speak truth, I must say such things
as I was formerly saying; and for lying,
whether a Philosopher can do it or not, I
cannot tell; I am sure I cannot do it.
But tho these Discourses may be uneasy
and ungrateful to them, I do not see why
they should seem foolish or extravagant:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53806:38"/>
indeed if I should either propose such
things as <hi>Plato</hi> has contrived in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth,
or as the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi> practise
in theirs, tho they might seem better, as
certainly they are, yet they are so quite
different from our Establishment, which
is founded on Property, there being no
such thing among them, that I could not
expect that it should have any effect on
them: But such Discourses as mine, that
only call past Evils to mind, and give
warning of what may follow, have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them that is so absurd, that they
may not be used at any time; for they
can only be unpleasant to those who are
resolved to run headlong the contrary
way: and if we must let alone every
thing as absurd or extravagant, which by
reason of the wicked Lives of many may
seem uncouth, we must, even among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
give over pressing the greatest part
of those things that Christ hath taught us:
tho he has commanded us not to conceal
them, but to proclaim on the House-tops
that which he taught in secret. The
greatest parts of his Precepts are more
disagreeing to the Lives of the Men of
this Age, than any part of my Discourse
has been: But the Preachers seem to have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53806:39"/>
learn'd that craft to which you advise me;
for they observing that the World would
not willingly sute their Lives to the Rules
that Christ has given, have fitted his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
as if it had been a leaden Rule,
to their Lives; that so some way or other
they might agree with one another. But
I see no other effect of this compliance,
except it be that Men become more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
in their wickedness by it. And this is
all the success that I can have in a Court;
for I must always differ from the rest, and
then I will signify nothing; or if I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with them, then I will only help
forward their madness. I do not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
what you mean by your casting
about, or by the bending and handling
things so dextrously, that if they go not
well, they may go as little ill as may be:
for in Courts they will not bear with a
Man's holding his peace, or conniving at
them: a Man must bare-facedly approve
of the worst Councils, and consent to the
blackest Designs: So that one would pass
for a Spy, or possibly for a Traitor, that
did but coldly approve of such wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Practices: And when a Man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in such a Society, he will be so far
from being able to mend Matters by his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53806:39"/>
casting about, as you call it, that he will
find no occasions of doing any good:
the ill Company will sooner corrupt him,
than be the better for him: or if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all their ill Company, he
remains still entire and innocent, yet their
Follies and Knavery will be imputed to
him; and by mixing Councils with them,
he must bear his share of all the blame
that belongs wholly to others.</p>
               <p>It was no ill Simily, by which <hi>Plato</hi>
set forth the unreasonableness of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher's
medling with Government: If
one, says he, shall see a great company
run out into the Rain every day, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to be wet in it; and if he knows
that it will be to no purpose for him to
go and perswade them to come into their
Houses, and avoid the Rain; so that all
that can be expected from his going to
speak to them, will be, that he shall be
wet with them; when it is so, he does best
to keep within Doors, and preserve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
since he cannot prevail enough to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
other Peoples Folly.</p>
               <p>Tho to speak plainly what is my Heart,
I must freely own to you, that as long as
there is any Property, and while Mony is
the Standard of all other things, I cannot
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53806:40"/>
think that a Nation can be governed
either Justly or Happily: Not Justly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the best things will fall to the share
of the worst of Men: Nor Happily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all things will be divided among a
few, (and even these are not in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
happy) the rest being left to be
absolutely miserable. Therefore when I
reflect on the wise and good Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians,</hi> among whom all
things are so well governed, and with so
few Laws; and among whom as Vertue
hath its due reward, yet there is such an
equality, that every Man lives in plenty;
and when I compare with them so many
other Nations that are still making new
Laws, and yet can never bring their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
to a right Regulation, among
whom tho every one has his Property; yet
all the Laws that they can invent, cannot
prevail so far, that Men can either obtain
or preserve it, or be certainly able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
what is their own, from what is
another Man's; of which the many Law
Suits that every day break out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
without any end, give too plain a
demonstration: When, I say, I ballance
all these things in my thoughts, I grow
more favourable to <hi>Plato,</hi> and do not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53806:40"/>
wonder that he resolved, not to make any
Laws for such as would not submit to a
community of all things: For so wise a
Man as he was, could not but foresee that
the setting all upon the Level, was the
only way to make a Nation happy; which
cannot be obtained so long as there is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty:
for when every Man draws to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
all that he can compass, by one Title
or another, it must needs follow, that
how plentiful soever a Nation may be, yet
a few dividing the Wealth of it among
themselves, the rest must fall under Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.
So that there will be two sorts
of People among them, that deserve that
their Fortunes should be interchanged;
the former being useless, but wicked and
ravenous; and the latter, who by their
constant industry serve the Publick more
than themselves, being sincere and modest
Men. From whence I am perswaded, that
till Property is taken away, there can be
no equitable or just distribution made of
things, nor can the World be happily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned:
for as long as that is maintained,
the greatest and the far best part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
will be still oppressed with a load
of Cares and Anxieties. I confess, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the taking of it quite away, those
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53806:41"/>
Pressures that lie on a great part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
may be made lighter; but they
can never be quite removed. For if Laws
were made, determining at how great an
extent in Soil, and at how much Mony
every Man must stop, and limiting the
Prince that he may not grow too great,
and restraining the People that they may
not become too insolent, and that none
might factiously aspire to publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and that they might neither be
sold, nor made burdensome by a great
expence; since otherwise those that serve
in them, will be tempted to reimburse
themselves by Cheats and Violence, and
it will become necessary to find out rich
Men for undergoing those Employments
for which wise Men ought rather to be
sought out; these Laws, I say, may have
such Effects, as good Diet and Care may
have on a Sick Man, whose recovery is
desperate: they may allay and mitigate
the Disease, but it can never be quite
healed, nor the Body Politick be brought
again to a good Habit, as long as Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
remains; and it will fall out as in a
complication of Diseases, that by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Remedy to one Sore, you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
another; and that which removes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53806:41"/>
one ill Symptom, produces others, while
the strengthning of one part of the Body
weakens the rest. On the contrary, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
I, it seems to me that Men cannot
live conveniently, where all things are
common: How can there be any Plenty,
where every Man will excuse himself from
Labour? For as the hope of Gain doth
not excite him, so the confidence that he
has in other Mens Industry, may make
him slothful: And if People come to be
pinched with Want, and yet cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of any thing as their own; what can
follow upon this, but perpetual Sedition
and Bloodshed, especially when the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Authority due to Magistrates
falls to the Ground? For I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
how that can be kept up among those
that are in all things equal to one another.
I do not wonder, said he, that it appears
so to you, since you have no Notion, or
at least no right one, of such a Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But if you had been in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia</hi> with
me, and had seen their Laws and Rules
as I did, for the space of five Years, in
which I lived among them; and during
which time I was so delighted with them,
that indeed I would never have left them,
if it had not been to make the discovery
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53806:42"/>
of that new World to the <hi>Europeans;</hi> you
would then confess that you had never
seen a People so well constituted as they
are. You will not easily perswade me,
said <hi>Peter,</hi> that any Nation in that New
World, is better governed than those
among us are. For as our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are not worse than theirs, so our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
if I mistake not, being ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a long practice has helped us to find
out many Conveniences of Life: And
some happy Chances have discovered
other things to us, which no Man's Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
could ever have invented. As
for the Antiquity, either of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or of ours, said he, you cannot
pass a true Judgment of it, unless you had
read their Histories; for if they are to be
believed, they had Towns among them,
before these parts were so much as inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited:
And as for these Discoveries, that
have been either hit on by chance, or
made by ingenious Men, these might
have hapned there as well as here. I do
not deny but we are more ingenious than
they are, but they exceed us much in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
and Application: They knew little
concerning us, before our arrival among
them; they call us all by a general Name
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53806:42"/>
of the Nations that lie beyond the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
Line; for their Chronicle mentions
a Shipwrack that was made on their Coast
1200 Years ago; and that some <hi>Romans</hi>
and <hi>Egyptians</hi> that were in the Ship, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
safe a Shore, spent the rest of their
days amongst them; and such was their
Ingenuity, that from this single Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
they drew the advantage of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from those unlook'd for Guests, all the
useful Arts that were then among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
which those Shipwrack'd Men
knew: And by the Hints that they gave
them, they themselves found out even
some of those Arts which they could not
fully explain to them; so happily did they
improve that Accident, of having some of
our People cast upon their shore: But if
any such Accident have at any time
brought any from thence into <hi>Europe,</hi> we
have been so far from improving it, that
we do not so much as remember it; as in
after Times perhaps it will be forgot by
our People that I was ever there. For
tho they from one such Accident, made
themselves Masters of all the good Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that were among us; yet I believe
it would be long before we would learn
or put in practice any of the good Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53806:43"/>
that are among them: And this is
the true Cause of their being better go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
and living happier than we do,
tho we come not short of them in point
of Understanding, or outward Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Upon this I said to him, I do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
beg of you, that you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
that Island very particularly to us.
Be not too short in it, but set out in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all things relating to their Soil, their
Rivers, their Towns, their People, their
Manners, Constitution, Laws, and in a
word, all that you imagine we desire to
know: and you may well imagine that
we desire to know every thing concerning
them, of which we are hitherto ignorant.
I will do it very willingly, said he, for I
have digested the whole Matter carefully;
but it will take up some time. Let us go
then, said I, first and dine, and then we
shall have leasure enough. Be it so, said
he. So we went in and dined, and after
Dinner we came back, and sat down in
the same place. I ordered my Servants to
take care that none might come and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
us: and both <hi>Peter</hi> and I desired
<hi>Raphael</hi> to be as good as his word: So
when he saw that we were very intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53806:43"/>
it, he paused a little to recollect himself,
and began in this manner.</p>

               <head>The Second Book.</head>
               <p>THE Island of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> in the middle
of it, where it is broadest, is 200
miles broad, and holds almost at the same
breadth over a great part of it; but it
grows narrower towards both ends. Its
Figure is not unlike a Crescent: between
its Horns, the Sea comes in eleven miles
broad, and spreads it self into a great Bay,
which is environed with Land to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of about 500 miles, and is well secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from Winds: There is no great Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in the Bay, and the whole Coast
is, as it were, one continued Harbour,
which gives all that live in the Island great
convenience for mutual Commerce: but
the entry into the Bay, what by Rocks on
one hand, and Shallows on the other, is very
dangerous. In the middle of it there is
one single Rock which appears above
Water, and so is not dangerous; on the
top of it there is a Tower built, in which
a Garrison is kept. The other Rocks lie
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53806:44"/>
under Water, and are very dangerous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Channel is known only to the Natives,
so that if any Stranger should enter into
the Bay, without one of their Pilates,
he would run a great danger of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack:
for even they themselves could
not pass it safe, if some marks that are on
their Coast did not direct their way; and
if these should be but a little shifted, any
Fleet that might come against them, how
great soever it were, would be certainly lost.
On the other side of the Island, there are
likewise many Harbours; and the Coast
is so fortified, both by Nature and Art, that
a small number of Men can hinder the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of a great Army. But they report
(and there remains good marks of it to
make it credible) that this was no Island at
first, but a part of the Continent. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topus</hi>
that conquered it (whose Name it still car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
for <hi>Abraxa</hi> was its first Name) and
brought the rude and uncivilized Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
into such a good Government, and
to that measure of Politeness, that they do
now far excel all the rest of mankind;
having soon subdued them, he designed
to separate them from the Continent, and
and to bring the Sea quite about them,
and in order to that he made a deep
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53806:44"/>
Channel to be digged fifteen miles long:
He not only forced the Inhabitants to
work at it, but likewise his own Souldiers,
that the Natives might not think he treated
them like Slaves; and having set vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Men to work, he brought it to
a speedy conclusion beyond all Mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations:
By this their Neighbours, who
laughed at the folly of the Undertaking
at first, were struck with admiration and
terror, when they saw it brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
There are 54 Cities in the Island,
all large and well built: the Manners,
Customs, and Laws of all their Cities are
the same, and they are all contrived as
near in the same manner, as the Ground
on which they stand will allow: The
nearest lie at least 24 miles distant from
one another, and the most remote are not
so far distant, but that a Man can go on
foot in one day from it, to that which lies
next it. Every City sends three of their
wisest Senators once a Year to <hi>Amaurot,</hi>
for consulting about their common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns;
for that is the cheif Town of the
Island, being situated near the Center of
it, so that it is the most convenient place for
their Assemblies. Every City has so much
Ground set off for its Jurisdiction, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53806:45"/>
there is twenty miles of Soil round it, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to it: and where the Towns lie
wider, they have much more Ground:
no Town desires to enlarge their Bounds,
for they consider themselves rather as Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
than Landlords of their Soil. They
have built over all the Country, Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses
for Husbandmen, which are well
contrived, and are furnished with all
things necessary for Countey-labour. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
are sent by turns from the Cities
to dwell in them; no Country-family
has fewer than fourty Men and Women in
it, besides two Slaves. There is a Master
and a Mistress set over every Family; and
over thirty Families there is a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
setled. Every Year twenty of this
Family come back to the Town, after
they have stayed out two Years in the
Country: and in their room there are
other twenty sent from the Town, that
they may learn Country-work, from
those that have been already one Year
in the Country, which they must teach
those that come to them the next Year
from the Town. By this means such as
dwell in those Country-Farms, are never
ignorant of Agriculture, and so commit
no Errors in it, which might otherwise be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53806:45"/>
fatal to them, and bring them under a
scarcity of Corn. But tho there is every
Year such a shifting of the Husbandmen,
that none may be forced against his mind
to follow that hard course of life too long;
yet many among them take such pleasure
in it, that they desire leave to continue
many Years in it. These Husbandmen
labour the Ground, breed Cattel, hew
Wood, and convey it to the Towns, either
by Land or Water, as is most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
They breed an infinite multitude of
Chickens in a very curious manner: for
the Hens do not sit and hatch them, but
they lay vast numbers of Eggs in a gentle
and equal heat, in which they are hatched;
and they are no sooner out of the Shell,
and able to stir about, but they seem to
consider those that feed them as their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and follow them as other Chickens
do the Hen that hatched them. They
breed very few Horses, but those they
have, are full of Mettle, and are kept on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for exercising their Youth in the Art of
sitting and riding of them; for they do
not put them to any Work, either of
Plowing or Carriage, in which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
Oxen; for tho Horses are stronger,
yet they find Oxen can hold out longer;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53806:46"/>
and as they are not subject to so many
Diseases, so they are kept upon a less
charge, and with less trouble: And when
they are so worn out, that they are no
more fit for labour, they are good Meat
at last. They sow no Corn, but that
which is to be their Bread; for they
drink either Wine, Cider, or Perry, and
often Water, sometimes pure, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
boiled with Hony or Liquorish,
with which they abound: and tho they
know exactly well how much Corn will
serve every Town, and all that tract of
Country which belongs to it, yet they
sow much more, and breed more Cattel
than are necessary for their consumption:
and they give that overplus of which
they make no use to their Neighbours.
When they want any thing in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which it does not produce, they fetch
that from the Town, without carrying
any thing in exchange for it: and the
Magistrates of the Town take care to see
it given them: for they meet generally in
the Town once a month, upon a Festival-Day.
When the time of Harvest comes,
the Magistrates in the Country send to
those in the Towns, and let them know
how many hands they will need for reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53806:46"/>
the Harvest; and the number they
call for being sent to them, they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dispatch it all in one day.</p>

                  <p>HE that knows one of their Towns,
knows them all, they are so like
one another, except where the scituation
makes some difference. I shall therefore
describe one of them, and it is no matter
which; but none is so proper as <hi>Amaurot:</hi>
for as none is more eminent, all the rest
yielding in precedence to this, because it
is the Seat of their Supream Council; so
there was none of them better known to
me, I having lived five Years altogether
in it.</p>
                  <p>It lies upon the side of a Hill, or rather
a rising Ground: its Figure is almost
square, for from the one side of it, which
shoots up almost to the top of the Hill, it
runs down in a descent for two miles to
the River <hi>Anider;</hi> but it is a little broader
the other way that runs along by the
Bank of that River. The <hi>Anider</hi> rises
about 80 miles above <hi>Amaurot,</hi> in a small
Spring at first; but other Brooks falling
into it, of which two are more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53806:47"/>
as it runs by <hi>Amaurot,</hi> it is grown

it is buried in the Ocean. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Town and the Sea, and for
some miles above the Town, it ebbs and
flows every six hours, with a strong Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
The Tide comes up for about
thirty miles so full, that there is nothing
but Salt-water in the River, the fresh
Water being driven back with its force;
and above that, for some miles, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is brackish, but a little higher, as it
runs by the Town, it is quite fresh; and
when the Tide ebbs, it continues fresh all
along to the Sea. There is a Bridg cast
over the River, not of Timber, but of
fair Stone, consisting of many stately
Arches; it lies at that part of the Town
which is farthest from the Sea, so that
Ships without any hindrance lie all along
the side of the Town. There is likewise
another River that runs by it, which tho
it is not great, yet it runs pleasantly, for it
rises out of the same Hill on which the
Town stands, and so runs down throw it,
and falls into the <hi>Anider.</hi> The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
have fortified the Fountain-head of
this River, which springs a little without
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53806:47"/>
the Towns; that so if they should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be besieged, the Enemy might not
be able to stop or divert the course of
the Water, nor poison it; from thence
it is carried in earthen Pipes to the lower
Streets: and for those places of the Town
to which the Water of that small River
cannot be conveyed, they have great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterns
for receiving the Rain-water, which
supplies the want of the other. The
Town is compassed with a high and thick
Wall, in which there are many Towers
and Forts; there is also a broad and deep
dry Ditch, set thick with Thorns, cast
round three sides of the Town, and the
River is instead of a Ditch on the fourth
side. The Streets are made very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for all Carriage, and are well shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
from the Winds. Their Buildings
are good, and are so uniform, that a
whole side of a Street looks like one
House. The Streets are twenty foot
broad; there lie Gardens behind all their
Houses; these are large, but enclosed with
Buildings, that on all Hands face the
Streets; so that every House has both a
Door to the Street, and a back Door to
the Garden: their Doors have all two
Leaves, which as they are easily opened,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53806:48"/>
so they shut of their own accord; and
there being no Property among them,
every Man may freely enter into any
House whatsoever. At every ten Years
ends, they shift their Houses by Lots.
They cultivate their Gardens with great
care, so that they have both Vines, Fruits,
Herbs, and Flowers in them; and all is
so well ordered, and so finely kept, that
I never saw Gardens any where that were
both so fruitful and so beautiful as theirs
are. And this humor of ordering their
Gardens so well, is not only kept up by
the pleasure they find in it, but also by
an emulation between the Inhabitants of
the several Streets, who vie with one
another in this Matter; and there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
nothing belonging to the whole
Town, that is both more useful, and more
pleasant. So that he who founded the
Town, seems to have taken care of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than of their Gardens; for
they say, the whole Scheme of the Town
was designed at first by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topus,</hi> but he
left all that belonged to the Ornament
and Improvement of it, to be added by
those that should come after him, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too much for one Man to bring to
perfection. Their Records, that contain
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53806:48"/>
the History of their Town and State, are
preserved with an exact care, and run
backwards 1760 Years. From these it
appears, that their Houses were at first
low and mean, like Cottages made of
any sort of Timber, and were built with
mud Walls, and thatch'd with Straw:
but now their Houses are three Stories
high, the Fronts of them are faced either
with Stone, Plaistering, or Brick; and
between the facings of their Walls, they
throw in their Rubbish; their Roofs are
flat, and on them they lay a sort of Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
which costs very little, and yet is so
tempered, that as it is not apt to take
Fire, so it resists the Weather more than
Lead does. They have abundance of
Glass among them, with which they glaze
their Windows: they use also in their
Windows, a thin linnen Cloth, that is so
oiled or gummed, that by that means it
both lets in the Light more freely to them,
and keeps out the Wind the better.</p>

All the Syphogrants, who are
in number 200, chuse the Prince out of a
List of four, whom the People of the
four Divisions of the City name to them;
but they take an Oath before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to an Election, that they will chuse
him whom they think meetest for the
Office: They give their Voices secretly,
so that it is not known for whom every
one gives his Suffrage. The Prince is for
Life, unless he is removed upon suspicion
of some design to enslave the People.
The <hi>Tranibors</hi> are new chosen every Year,
but yet they are for the most part still
continued: All their other Magistrates
are only Annual. The <hi>Tranibors</hi> meet
every third day, and oftner if need be,

the Affairs of the State in general,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53806:49"/>
or such private Differences as may arise
sometimes among the People; tho that
falls out but seldom. There are always
two <hi>Syphogrants</hi> called into the Council-Chamber,
and these are changed every
day. It is a fundamental Rule of their
Government, that no Conclusion can be
made in any thing that relates to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,

                  <p>These things have been so provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, that the Prince and the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibors</hi>

sent to the <hi>Syphogrants;</hi> who after they
have communicated it with the Families
that belong to their Divisions, and have
considered it among themselves, make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to the Senate; and upon great Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
the Matter is referred to the
Council of the whole Island. One Rule
observed in their Council, is, never to
debate a thing on the same day in which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53806:50"/>
is first proposed; for that is always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the next meeting, that so Men
may not rashly, and in the heat of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
engage themselves too soon, which
may biass them so much, that instead of
considering the Good of the Publick,
they will rather study to maintain their
own Notions; and by a perverse and
preposterous sort of shame, hazard their
Country, rather than endanger their own
Reputation, or venture the being suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to have wanted foresight in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients
that they proposed at first. And
therefore to prevent this, they take care
that they may rather be deliberate, than
sudden in their Motions.</p>

                  <p>AGriculture is that which is so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
understood among them all,
that no Person, either Man or Woman, is
ignorant of it; from their Childhood
they are instructed in it, partly by what
they learn at School, and partly by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
they being led out often into the
Fields, about the Town, where they not
only see others at work, but are likewise
exercised in it themselves. Besides Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53806:50"/>
which is so common to them all,
every Man has some peculiar Trade to
which he applies himself, such as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
of Wool, or Flax, Masonry,
Smiths Work, or Carpenters Work; for
there is no other sort of Trade that is in
great esteem among them. All the Island
over, they wear the same sort of Clothes
without any other distinction, except
that which is necessary for marking the
difference between the two Sexes, and
the married and unmarried. The fashion
never alters; and as it is not ungrateful
nor uneasy, so it is fitted for their Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and calculated both for their Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
and Winters. Every Family makes
their own Clothes; but all among them,
Women as well as Men, learn one or
other of the Trades formerly mentioned.
Women, for the most part, deal in Wool
and Flax, which sute better with their
feebleness, leaving the other ruder Trades
to the Men. Generally the same Trade
passes down from Father to Son, Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
often following Descent: but if any
Man's Genius lies another way, he is by
Adoption translated into a Family that
deals in the Trade to which he is inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And when that is to be done, care
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53806:51"/>
is taken, not only by his Father, but by
the Magistrate, that he may be put to a
discreet and good Man. And if after a
Man has learn'd one Trade, he desires to
acquire another, that is also allowed, and
is managed in the same manner as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
When he has learn'd both, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that which he likes best, unless the
Publick has more occasion for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The chief, and almost the only Business
of the <hi>Syphogrants,</hi> is to take care that no
Man may live idle, but that every one
may follow his Trade diligently: yet they
do not wear themselves out with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Toil, from Morning to Night, as if
they were Beasts of Burden; which as it
is indeed a heavy slavery, so it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
course of Life of all Tradesmen eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, except among the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians:</hi>
But they dividing the Day and Night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
twenty four hours, appoint six of these
for Work, three of them are before Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and after that they dine, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
their Labour for two hours, and then
they go to work again for other three
hours; and after that they sup, and at
eight a Clock, counting from Noon, they
go to bed and sleep eight hours: and for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53806:51"/>
their other hours, besides those of Work,
and those that go for eating and sleeping,
they are left to every Man's discretion;
yet they are not to abuse that Interval to
Luxury and Idleness, but must imploy it in
some proper Exercise according to their
various Inclinations, which is for the
most part Reading. It is ordinary to have
Publick Lectures every Morning before
day-break; to which none are obliged to
go, but those that are mark'd out for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature;
yet a great many, both Men
and Women of all Ranks, go to hear Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of one sort or another, according
to the variety of their Inclinations. But
if others, that are not made for Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
chuse rather to imploy themselves
at that time in their Trade, as many of
them do, they are not hindred, but are
commended rather, as Men that take care
to serve their Country. After Supper,
they spend an hour in some Diversion: In
Summer it is in their Gardens, and in
Winter it is in the Halls where they eat;
and thy entertain themselves in them,
either with Musick or Discourse. They
do not so much as know Dice, or such<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
foolish and mischievous Games: They
have two sorts of Games not unlike our
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                        <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:53806:52"/>
profitable Trades; and if all that number
that languishes out their Life in sloth and
idleness, of whom every one consumes as
much as any two of the Men that are at
work do, were forced to labour, you
may easily imagine that a small proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of time would serve for doing all that
is either necessary, profitable, or pleasant
to Mankind, pleasure being still kept
within its due bounds: Which appears
very plainly in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> for there, in a
great City, and in all the Territory that
lies round it, you can scarce find five
hundred, either Men or Women, that by
their Age and Strength, are capable of
Labour, that are not engaged in it;
even the <hi>Syphogrants</hi> themselves, tho the
Law excuses them, yet do not excuse
themselves, that so by their Examples they
may excite the industry of the rest of the
People; the like exemption is allowed to
those, who being recommended to the
People by the Priests, are by the secret
Suffrages of the <hi>Syphogrants,</hi> priviledged
from Labour, that they may apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
wholly to study; and if any of
these falls short of those Hopes that he
seemed to give at first, he is obliged to go
to work. And sometimes a Mechanick,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53806:52"/>
that does so imploy his leasure hours, that
he makes a considerable advancement in
Learning, is eased from being a Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and ranked among their Learned
Men. Out of these they chuse their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
their Priests, their <hi>Tranibors,</hi>
and the Prince himself; who was ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called their <hi>Barzenes,</hi> but is called of
late their <hi>Ademus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus from the great numbers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, that are neither suffered to
be idle, nor to be imployed in any fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Labour; you may easly make the
estimate, how much good Work may be
done in those few hours in which they are
obliged to labour. But besides all that
has been already said, this is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that those needful Arts which are
among them, are managed with less
labour than any where else. The build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or the repairing of Houses among
us, employs many hands, because often a
thriftless Heir suffers a House that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
built, to fall into decay, so that his
Successor must, at a great cost, repair
that which he might have kept up with a
small charge: and often it falls out, that
the same House which one built at a vast
expence, is neglected by another, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53806:53"/>
thinks he has a more delicate sense of such
things; and he suffering it to fall to ruin,
builds another at no less charge. But
among the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians,</hi> all things are so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated,
that Men do very seldom build
upon any new piece of Ground; and
they are not only very quick in repairing
their Houses, but shew their foresight in
preventing their decay: So that their
Buildings are preserved very long, with
very little labour: And thus the Crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to whom that care belongs, are often
without any Imploiment, except it be the
hewing of Timber, and the squaring of
Stones, that so the Materials may be in
readiness for raising a Building very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
when there is any occasion for it.
As for their Clothes, observe how little
work goes for them: While they are at
labour, they are cloathed with Leather
and Skins, cast carelesly about them, which
will last seven Years; and when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in publick, they put on an upper
Garment, which hides the other: and these
are all of one colour, and that is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
colour of the Wool: and as they
need less Woollen Cloth than is used any
where else, so that which they do need,
is much less costly. They use Linnen
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53806:53"/>
Cloth more; but that is prepared with
less labour, and they value Cloth only by
the whiteness of the Linnen, or the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Wool, without much regard
to the fineness of the Thread; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in other places, four or five upper Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Woollen Cloth, and of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Colours, and as many Vests of Silk
will scarce serve one Man; and those that
are nicer, think ten too few; every Man
there is contented with one which very
oft serves him two Years. Nor is there
any thing that can tempt a Man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
more; for if he had them, he would
neither be the warmer, nor would he
make one jot the better appearance for it.
And thus since they are all imploied in
some useful Labour; and since they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves with fewer things, it falls
out that there is a great abundance of all
things among them: So that often, for
want of other Work, if there is any
need of mending their High Ways at any
time, you will see marvellous numbers of
people brought out to work at them;
and when there is no occasion of any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
work, the hours of working are
lessened by publick Proclamation; for the
Magistrates do not engage the people
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53806:54"/>
into any needless Labour, since by their
constitution they aim chiefly at this, that
except in so far as publick necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
it, all the people may have as much
free time for themselves as may be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the improvement of their minds,
for in this they think the happiness of Life
consists.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of their Traffick.</head>
                  <p>BUT it is now time to explain to you
the mutual Intercourse of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
their Commerce, and the Rules by
which all things are distributed among
them. As their Cities are composed of
Families, so their Families are made up of
those that are nearly related to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Their Women, when they grow
up, are married out; but all the Males,
both Children and Grandchildren, live
still in the same House, in great obedience
to their common Parent, unless Age has
weakned his Understanding; and in that
case he that is next to him in Age, comes
in his room. But lest any City should
become either out of measure great, or
fall under a dispeopling by any accident,
provision is made that none of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53806:54"/>
may have above six thousand Families
in it, besides those of the Country round
it; and that no Family may have less than
ten, and more than sixteen Persons in it;
but there can be no determined number
for the Children under Age: And this
Rule is easily observed, by removing some
of the Children of a more fruitful Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to any other Family that does not
abound so much in them. By the same
Rule, they supply Cities that do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
so fast, by others that breed faster:
And if there is any encrease over the
whole Island, then they draw out a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their Citizens out of the several
Towns, and send them over to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Continent; where, if they find
that the Inhabitants have more Soil than
they can well cultivate, they fix a Colony,
taking in the Inhabitants to their Society,
if they will live with them; and where they
do that of their own accord, they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
go into their method of Life, and to
their Rules, and this proves a happiness
to both the Nations: for according to
their constitution, such care is taken of
the Soil, that it becomes fruitful enogh
for both, tho it might be otherwise too
narrow and barren for any one of them.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53806:55"/>
But if the Natives refuse to conform
themselves to their Laws, they drive them
out of those Bounds which they mark out
for themselves, and use force if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.
For they account it a very just cause
of War, if any Nation will hinder others
to come and possess a part of their Soil,
of which they make no use, but let it lie
idle and uncultivated; since every Man
has by the Law of Nature a right to such
a waste Portion of the Earth, as is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for his subsistence. If any Accident
has so lessened the number of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of any of their Towns, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made up from the other Towns of
the Island, without diminishing them too
much, which is said to have fallen out
but twice, since they were first a People,
by two Plagues that were among them;
then the number is filled up, by recalling
so many out of their Colonies, for they
will abandon their Colonies, rather than
suffer any of their Towns to sink too
low.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the manner of their
living together; the Ancientest of every
Family governs it, as has been said. Wives
serve their Husbands, and Children their
Parents, and always the Younger serves
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53806:55"/>
the Elder. Every City is divided into
four equal Parts, and in the middle of
every part there is a Market-place: that
which is brought thither manufactured by
the several Families, is carried from thence
to Houses appointed for that purpose, in
which all things of a sort are laid by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and every Father of a Family
goes thither, and takes whatsoever he or
his Family stand in need of, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
paying for it, or laying in any thing
in pawn or exchange for it. There is no
reason for denying any thing to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
since there is such plenty of every
thing among them: and there is no
danger of any Man's asking more than he
needs; for what should make any do
that, since they are all sure that they will
be always supplied? It is the fear of want
that makes any of the whole Race of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
either greedy or ravenous; but
besides Fear, there is in Man a vast Pride,
that makes him fancy it a particular Glory
for him to excel other in Pomp and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
But by the Laws of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians,</hi>
there is no room for these things among
them. Near these Markets there are also
others for all sorts of Victuals, where
there are not only Herbs, Fruits, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53806:56"/>
Bread, but also Fish, Fowl, and Cattel.
There are also without their Towns, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
appointed near some running Water,
for killing their Beasts, and for washing
away their filth; which is done by their
Slaves, for they suffer none of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
to kill their Cattel, becaues they
think, that Pity and good Nature, which
are among the best of those Affections
that are born with us, are much impaired
by the butchering of Animals: Nor do
they suffer any thing that is foul or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
to be brought within their Towns,
lest the Air should be infected by ill smells
which might prejudice their Health. In
every Street there are great Halls that lie
at an equal distance from one another,
which are marked by particular Names.
The <hi>Syphogrants</hi> dwell in these, that are
set over thirty Families, fifteen lying on
one side of it, and as many on the other.
In these they do all meet and eat. The
Stewards of every one of them come to
the Market-place at an appointed hour;
and according to the number of those
that belong to their Hall, they carry
home Provisions. But they take more
care of their Sick, than of any others,
who are looked after and lodged in public
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53806:56"/>
Hospitals: They have belonging to every
Town four Hospitals, that are built with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Walls, and are so large, that
they may pass for little Towns: By this
means, if they had ever such a number
of sick Persons, they could lodg them
conveniently, and at such a distance, that
such of them as are sick of infectious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
may be kept so far from the rest,
that there can be no danger of Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Hospitals are so furnished and
stored with all things that are convenient
for the ease and recovery of their Sick;
and those that are put in them, are all
looked after with so tender and watchful
a care, and are so constantly treated by
their skilful Physicians; that as none is sent
to them against their will, so there is scarce
one in a whole Town, that if he should
fall ill, would not chuse rather to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thither,
than lie sick at home.</p>
                  <p>After the Steward of the Hospitals has
taken for them whatsoever the Physician
does prescribe at the Market-place, then
the best things that remain, are distributed
equally among the Halls, in proportion
to their numbers, only, in the first place,
they serve the Prince, the chief Priest,
the <hi>Tranibors</hi> and Ambassadors, and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53806:57"/>
(if there are any, which indeed falls
out but seldom, and for whom there are
Houses well furnished, particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
when they come among them).
At the hours of Dinner and Supper, the
whole Syphogranty being called together
by sound of Trumpet, meets and eats to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
except only such as are in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals,
or lie sick at home. Yet after the
Halls are served, no Man is hindred to
carry Provisions home from the Market-place;
for they know that none does that
but for some good reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for tho any
that will may eat at home, yet none does
it willingly, since it is both an indecent
and foolish thing, for any to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the trouble to make ready an ill
Dinner at home, when there is a much
more plentiful one made ready for him so
near hand. All the uneasy and sordid Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
about these Halls, are performed by
their Slaves; but the dressing and cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Meat, and the ordering their
Tables, belongs only to the Women;
which goes round all the Women of every
Family by turns. They sit at three or
more Tables, according to their numbers;
the Men sit towards the Wall, and the
Women sit on the other side, that if any
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53806:57"/>
of them should fall suddenly ill, which is
ordinary to Women with Child, she may,
without disturbing the rest, rise and go
to the Nurses Room, who are there with
the suckling Children; where there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Fire, and clean Water at hand, and
some Cradles in which they may lay the
young Children, if there is occasion for
it, and that they may shift and dress them
before the Fire. Every Child is nursed
by its own Mother, if Death or Sickness
does not intervene; and in that case the
<hi>Syphogrants</hi> Wives find out a Nurse quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which is no hard matter to do; for
any one that can do it, offers her self chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
for as they are much inclined to
that piece of Mercy, so the Child whom
they nurse, considers the Nurse as its
Mother. All the Children under five Years
old, sit among the Nurses, the rest of the
younger sort of both Sexes, till they are
fit for Marriage, do either serve those that
sit at Table; or if they are not strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for that, they stand by them in
great silence, and eat that which is given
them, by those that sit at Table; nor
have they any other formality of dining.
In the middle of the first Table, which
stands in the upper end of the Hall, a-
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                        <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>

                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:53806:58"/>
trey, where they live at a greater distance,
every one eats at home, and no Family
wants any necessary sort of Provision,
for it is from them that Provisions are
sent unto those that live in the Towns.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of the Travelling of the Utopians.</head>
                  <p>IF any of them has a mind to visit his
Friends that live in some other Town,
or desires to travel and see the rest of the
Country, he obtains leave very easily from
the <hi>Syphogrant</hi> and <hi>Tranibors</hi> to do it, when
there is no particular occasion for him at
home: such as travel, carry with them a
Passport from the Prince, which both
certifies the Licence that is granted for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,
and limits the Time of their return.
They are furnished with a Wagon and a
Slave, who drives the Oxen, and looks
after them: but unless there are Women
in the Company, the Wagon is sent back
at the end of the Journey as a needless
trouble: While they are on the Road,
they carry no Provisions with them; yet
they want nothing, but are every way
treated as if they were at home. If they
stay in any place longer then a Night,
every one follows his proper Occupation,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53806:58"/>
and is very well used by those of his
own Trade: but if any Man goes out
of the City to which he belongs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leave, and is found going about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Passport, he is roughly handled, and
is punished as a Fugitive, and sent home
disgracefully; and if he falls again into the
like Fault, he is condemned to slavery.
If any Man has a mind to travel only over
the Precinct of his own City, he may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do it, obtaining his Father's Permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and his Wives Consent; but when
he comes into any of the Countrey-houses,
he must labour with them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Rules, if he expects to be
entertaind by them: and if he does this,
he may freely go over the whole Precinct,
being thus as useful to the City to which
he belongs, as if he were still within it.
Thus you see that there are no idle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
among them, nor pretences of excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
any from Labour. There are no
Taverns, no Alehouses, nor Stews among
them; nor any other occasions of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves, or of getting into Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or forming themselves into Parties:
All Men live in full view, so that all are
obliged, both to perform their ordinary
Task, and to employ themselves well in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53806:59"/>
their spare hours. And it is certain, that
a People thus ordered, must live in great
abundance of all things; and these being
equally distributed among them, no Man
can want any thing, or be put to beg.</p>
                  <p>In their great Council at <hi>Amaurot,</hi> to
which there are three sent from every
Town once every Year, they examine
what Towns abound in Provisions, and
what are under any Scarcity, that so the
one may be furnished from the other;
and this is done freely, without any sort
of exchange; for according to their Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Scarcity, they supply, or are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
from one another; so that indeed
the whole Island is, as it were, one
Family. When they have thus taken
care of their whole Country, and laid up
stores for two Years, which they do in
case that an ill Year should happen to
come, then they order an Exportation of
the Overplus, both of Corn, Honey,
Wool, Flax, Wood, Scarlet, and Purple;
Wax, Tallow, Leather, and Cattel, which
they send out commonly in great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to other Countries. They order a
seventh part of all these Goods to be freely
given to the Poor of the Countries to
which they send them, and they sell the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53806:59"/>
rest at moderate Rates. And by this
exchange, they not only bring back those
few things that they need at home, for
indeed they scarce need any thing but Iron,
but likewise a great deal of Gold and
Silver; and by their driving this trade so
long, it is not to be imagined how vast
a Treasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have got among them:
so that now they do not much care whether
they sell off their Merchandize for Mony
in hand, or upon trust. A great part of
their Treasure is now in Bonds; but in
all their Contracts no private Man stands
bound, but the Writing runs in Name
of the Town; and the Towns that owe
them Mony, raise it from those private
hands that owe it to them, and lay it up in
their publick Chamber, or enjoy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of it till the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi> call for it; and
they chuse rather to let the greatest part of
it lie in their hands, who make advantage
by it, then to call for it themselves: but
if they see that any of their other Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
stand more in need of it, then they
raise it, and lend it to them; or use it
themselves, if they are engaged in a War,
which is the only occasion that they can
have for all that Treasure that they have
laid up; that so either in great Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53806:60"/>
or sudden Accidents, they may
serve themselves by it; cheifly for hiring
Foreign Souldiers, whom they more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
expose to danger than their own
People: They give them great Pay,
knowing well that this will work even
on their Enemies, and engage them either
to betray their own side, or at least to
desert it, or will set them on to mutual
Factions among themselves: for this end
they have an incredible Treasure; but
they do not keep it as a Treasure, but in
such a manner as I am almost affraid to tell
it, lest you think it so extravagant, that
you can hardly believe it; which I
have the more reason to apprehend from
others, because if I had not seen it my
self, I could not have been easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to have beleived it upon any Man's
Report.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, that all things appear so
far incredible to us, as they differ from
our own Customs: but one who can judg
aright, will not wonder to find, that
since their other Constitutions differ so
much from ours, their value of Gold and
Silver should be measured, not by our
Standard, but by one that is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from it; for since they have no use
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53806:60"/>
of Mony among themselves, but keep it
for an accident; that tho, as it may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
fall out, it may have great intervals;
they value it no further than it deserves,
or may be useful to them. So that it is
plain, that they must prefer Iron either
to Gold or Silver: for Men can no more
live without Iron, than without Fire or
Water; but Nature has markt out no use
for the other Metals, with which we may
not very well dispence. The folly of
Man has enhansed the value of Gold
and Silver, because of their scarcity:
whereas on the contrary they reason, that
Nature, as an indulgent Parent, has
given us all the best things very freely,
and in great abundance, such as are
Water and Earth, but has laid up and
hid from us the things that are vain and
useless.</p>
                  <p>If those Metals were laid up in any
Tower among them, it would give jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy
of the Prince and Senate, according
to that foolish mistrust into which the
Rabble is apt to fall, as if they intended to
cheat the People, and make advantages to
themselves by it; or if they should work it
into Vessels, or any sort of Plate, they
fear that the People might grow too fond
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53806:61"/>
of it, and so be unwilling to let the Plate
be run down, if a War made it necessary
to pay their Souldiers with it: Therefore
to prevent all these inconveniences, they
have fallen upon an expedient, which as
it agrees with their other Policy, so is
very different from ours, and will scarce
gain belief among us, who value Gold so
much, and lay it up so carefully: for
whereas they eat and drink out of Vessels
of Earth, or Glass, that tho they look
very prety, yet are of very slight Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials;
they make their Chamber-pots
and Close-stools of Gold and Silver; and
that not only in their publick Halls, but
in their private Houses: Of the same Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
they likewise make Chains and Fetters
for their Slaves; and as a Badge of Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
they hang an Ear-ring of Gold to
some, and make others wear a Chain or a
Coronet of Gold; and thus they take care,
by all manner of ways, that Gold and
Silver may be of no esteem among them;
And from hence it is, that whereas other
Nations part with their Gold and their Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as unwillingly as if one tore out
their Bowels, those of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia</hi> would look
on their giving in all their Gold or Silver,
when there were any use for it, but as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53806:61"/>
the parting with a Trifle, or as we would
estimate the loss of a Penny. They find
Pearls on their Coast; and Diamonds,
and Carbuncles on their Rocks: they do
not look after them, but if they find them
by chance, they polish them, and with
them they adorn their Children, who
are delighted with them, and glory in
them during their Childhood; but when
they grow to Years, and see that none
but Children use such Baubles, they of
their own accord, without being bid by
their Parents, lay them aside; and would
be as much ashamed to use them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as Children among us, when they
come to Years, are of their Nuts, Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
and other Toies.</p>
                  <p>I never saw a clearer Instance of the
different impressions that different Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
make on People, than I observed in
the Ambassadors of the <hi>Anemolians</hi> who
came to <hi>Amaurot</hi> when I was there: and
because they came to treat of Affairs of
great Consequence, the Deputies from the
several Towns had met to wait for their
coming. The Ambassadours of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that lie near <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> knowing their
Customs, and that fine Cloaths are in no
esteem among them; that Silk is despised,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53806:62"/>
and Gold is a Badg of Infamy, use to come
very modestly cloathed; but the <hi>Anemoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
that lay more remote, and so had little
commerce with them, when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that they were coursly cloathed, and
all in the same manner, they took it for
granted that they had none of those fine
Things among them of which they made
no use; and they being a vain-glorious,
rather than a wise People, resolved to set
themselves out with so much pomp, that
they should look like Gods, and so strike
the Eyes of the poor <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi> with their
splendor. Thus three Ambassadors made
their entry with an hundred Attendants,
that were all clad in Garments of different
colours, and the greater part in Silk;
the Ambassadors themselves, who were of
the Nobility of their Country, were in
Cloth of Gold, and adorned with massy
Chains, Ear-rings and Rings of Gold:
Their Caps were covered with Bracelets
set full of Pearls and other Gems: In a
word, they were set out with all those
things, that among the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi> were either
the Badges of Slavery, the Marks of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
or Childrens Rattels. It was not
unpleasant to see on the one side how
they lookt big, when they compared their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53806:62"/>
rich Habits with the plain Cloaths of the
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians,</hi> who were come out in great
numbers to see them make their Entry:
And on the other side, to observe how
much they were mistaken in the Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they hoped this Pomp would
have made on them: It appeared so ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
a shew to all that had never stirred
out of their Country, and so had not seen
the Customs of other Nations; that tho
they paid some reverence to those that
were the most meanly clad, as if they had
been the Ambassadors, yet when they saw
the Ambassadors themselves, so full of
Gold Chains, they looking upon them as
Slaves, made them no reverence at all.
You might have seen their Children, who
were grown up to that bigness, that they
had thrown away their Jewels, call to
their Mothers, and push them gently, and
cry out, See that great Fool that wears
Pearls and Gems, as if he were yet a
Child. And their Mothers answered them
in good earnest, Hold your Peace, this is,
I believe, one of the Ambassador's Fools.
Others censured the fashion of their
Chains, and observed that they were of
no use, for they were too slight to bind
their Slaves, who could easily break them;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53806:63"/>
and they saw them hang so loose about
them, that they reckoned they could easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
throw them away, and so get from them.
But after the Ambassadors had staid a day
among them, and saw so vast a quantity
of Gold in their Houses, which was as
much despised by them, as it was esteemed
in other Nations, and that there was more
Gold and Silver in the Chains and Fetters
of one Slave, than all their Ornaments
amounted to, their Plumes fell, and they
were ashamed of all that Glory for which
they had formerly valued themselves, and
so laid it aside: to which they were the
more determined, when upon their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
into some free Discourse with the
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians,</hi> they discovered their sense of
such things, and their other Customs.
The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi> wonder how any Man
should be so much taken with the glaring
doubtful lustre of a Jewel or Stone, that
can look up to a Star, or to the Sun him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
or how any should value himself,
because his Cloth is made of a finer
Thread: for how fine soever that Thread
may be, it was once no better than the
Fleece of a Sheep, and that Sheep was a
Sheep still for all its wearing it. They
wonder much to hear, that Gold which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53806:63"/>
it self is so useless a thing, should be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where so much esteemed, that even
Men for whom it was made, and by whom
it has its value, should yet be thought of
less value than it is: So that a Man of
Lead, who has no more sence than a Log
of Wood, and is as bad as he is foolish,
should have many wise and good Men
serving him, only because he has a great
heap of that Metal; and if it should so
happen, that by some Accident, or Trick
of Law, (which does sometimes produce
as great Changes as Chance it self) all
this Wealth should pass from the Master
to the meanest Varlet of his whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he himself would very soon become
one of his Servants, as if he were a thing
that belonged to his Wealth, and so were
bound to follow its Fortune. But they
do much more admire and detest their
folly, who when they see a rich Man, tho
they neither owe him any thing, nor are
in any sort obnoxious to him, yet meerly
because he is rich, they give him little less
than Divine Honours; even tho they
know him to be so covetous and base
minded, that notwithstanding all his
Wealth, he will not part with one Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it to them as long as he lives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:53806:64"/>
These and such like Notions has that
People drunk in, partly from their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
being bred in a Country, whose
Customs and Constitutions are very oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to all such foolish Maxims: and partly
from their Learning and Studies; for tho
there are but few in any Town that are
excused from Labour, so that they may
give themselves wholly to their Studies,
these being only such Persons as discover
from their Childhood an extraordinary
capacity and disposition for Letters, yet
their Children, and a great part of the
Nation, both Men and Women, are taught
to spend those hours in which they are
not obliged to work, in Reading: and
this they do their whole Life long. They
have all their Learning in their own
Tongue; which is both a copious and
pleasant Language, and in which a Man
can fully express his Mind: It runs over a
great Tract of many Countries, but it is
not equally pure in all places: They had
never so much as heard of the Names of
any of those Philosophers that are so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in these parts of the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we went among them: and yet
they had made the same Discoveries that
the <hi>Greeks</hi> had done, both in Musick, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53806:64"/>
Arithmetick, and Geometry. But
as they are equal to the Ancient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
almost in all things, so they far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
our Modern Logicians, for they
have never yet fallen upon the barbarous
Nicities that our Youth are forced to learn
in those trifling Logical Schools that are
among us; and they are so far from
minding Chimera's, and Fantastical Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
made in the Mind, that none of them
could comprehend what we meant, when
we talked to them of a Man in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract,
as common to all Men in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
(so that tho we spoke of him as a
thing that we could point at with our
Fingers, yet none of them could perceive
him) and yet distinct from every one, as
if he were some monstrous Colossus or
Giant. Yet for all this ignorance of
these empty Notions, they knew Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
and all the Motions of the Orbs
exactly; and they have many Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
well contrived and divided, by
which they do very accurately compute
the Course and Positions of the Sun,
Moon, and Stars. But for the Cheat, of
divining by the Stars, and by their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
or Conjunctions, it has not so
much as entred into their Thoughts. They
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                        <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:53806:65"/>
this caution, that a lesser Pleasure might
not stand in the way of a greater, and
that no pleasure ought to be pursued, that
should draw a great deal of pain after it:
for they think it the maddest thing in the
World to pursue Vertue, that is a sour
and difficult thing; and not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the pleasures of Life, but willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to undergo much pain and trouble, if
a Man has no prospect of a Reward. And
what Reward can there be, for one that
has passed his whole Life, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pleasure, but in pain, if there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be expected after death? Yet they
do not place Happiness in all sorts of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
but only in those that in themselves
are good and honest: for whereas there
is a Party among them that places Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in bare Vertue, others think that our
Natures are conducted by Vertue to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
as that which is the chief Good of
Man. They define Vertue thus, that it is
a living according to Nature; and think
that we are made by God for that end:
They do believe that a Man does then
follow the Dictates of Nature, when he
pursues or avoids things according to the
direction of Reason: they say, that the
first dictate of Reason is, the kindling in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53806:65"/>
us a love and reverence for the Divine
Majesty, to whom we owe both all that
we have, and all that we can ever hope
for. In the next place, Reason directs
us, to keep our Minds as free of Passion,
and as chearful as we can; and that we
should consider our selves as bound by the
ties of good Nature and Humanity, to
use our utmost endeavours to help forward
the Happiness of all other Persons; for
there was never any Man that was such a
morose and severe pursuer of Vertue, and
such an Enemy to Pleasure, that tho he set
hard Rules to Men to undergo, much pain,
many watchings, and other rigors, yet
did not at the same time advise them to
do all they could in order to the relieving
and easing such People as were miserable;
and did not represent it as a mark of a
laudable temper, that it was gentle and
good natured: And they infer from
thence, that if a Man ought to advance
the welfare and comfort of the rest of
Mankind, there being no Vertue more
proper and peculiar to our Nature, than
to ease the miseries of others, to free them
from trouble &amp; anxiety, in furnishing them
with the Comforts of Life, that consist in
Pleasure; Nature does much more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53806:66"/>
lead him to do all this for himself.
A Life of Pleasure, is either a real Evil;
and in that case we ought not only, not
to assist others in their pursuit of it, but
on the contrary, to keep them from it all
we can, as from that which is hurtful and
deadly to them; or if it is a good thing,
so that we not only may, but ought to
help others to it, Why then ought not a
Man to begin with himself? since no Man
can be more bound to look after the good
of another, than after his own: for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cannot direct us to be good and kind
to others, and yet at the same time to be
unmerciful and cruel to our selves. Thus
as they define Vertue to be a living ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Nature, so they reckon that
Nature sets all People on to seek after
Pleasure, as the end of all they do. They
do also observe, that in order to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the Pleasures of Life, Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
us to enter into Society; for there
is no Man so much raised above the rest of
mankind, that he should be the only Favorite
of Nature, which on the contrary seems
to have levelled all those together that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the same Species. Upon this they
infer, that no Man ought to seek his own
Conveniences so eagerly, that thereby he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53806:66"/>
should prejudice others; and therefore
they think, that not only all Agreements
between private Persons ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;
but likewise, that all those Laws
ought to be kept, which either a good
Prince has published in due form, or to
which a People, that is neither oppressed
with Tyranny, nor circumvented by
Fraud, has consented, for distributing
those Conveniences of Life which afford
us all our Pleasures.</p>
                  <p>They think it is an evidence of true
Wisdom, for a Man to pursue his own
Advantages, as far as the Laws allow it.
They account it <hi>Piety,</hi> to prefer the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good to one's Private Concerns;
but they think it unjust, for a Man to
seek for his own Pleasure, by snatching
another Man's Pleasures from him. And
on the contrary, they think it a sign of a
gentle and good Soul, for a Man to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence
with his own Advantage for the
good of others; and that by so doing, a
good Man finds as much pleasure one way,
as he parts with another; for as he may
expect the like from others when he may
come to need it, so if that should fail him,
yet the Sense of a good Action, and the
Reflections that one makes on the Love
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53806:67"/>
and Gratitude of those whom he has so
obliged, gives the Mind more Pleasure,
than the Body could have found in that
from which it had restrained it self: they
are also perswaded that God will make up
the loss of those small Pleasures, with a
vast and endless Joy, of which Religion
does easily convince a good Soul.</p>
                  <p>Thus upon an enquiry into the whole
Matter, they reckon that all our Actions,
and even all our Vertues terminate in
Pleasure, as in our chief End and greatest
Happiness; and they call every Motion
or State, either of Body or Mind, in
which Nature teaches us to delight, a
Pleasure. And thus they cautiously limit
Pleasure, only to those Appetites to which
Nature leads us; for they reckon that
Nature leads us only to those Delights to
which Reason as well as Sense carries us,
and by which we neither injure any other
Person, nor let go greater Pleasures for
it; and which do not draw troubles on
us after them: but they look upon those
Delights which Men, by a foolish tho
common Mistake, call <hi>Pleasure,</hi> as if
they could change the Nature of Things,
as well as the use of Words, as things that
not only do not advance our Happiness,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53806:67"/>
but do rather obstruct it very much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do so entirely possess the Minds
of those that once go into them, with a
false Notion of Pleasure, that there is no
room left for truer and purer Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
                  <p>There are many things that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have nothing that is truly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
On the contrary, they have a good
deal of bitterness in them; and yet by
our perverse Appetites after forbidden
Objects, are not only ranked among the
Pleasures, but are made even the greatest
Designs of Life. Among those who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
these sophisticated Pleasures, they
reckon those whom I mentioned before,
who think themselves really the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for having fine Clothes; in which
they think they are doubly mistaken,
both in the Opinion that they have of
their Clothes, and in the Opinion
that they have of themselves; for if
you consider the use of Clothes, why
should a fine Thread be thought better
than a course one? And yet that sort of
Men, as if they had some real Advantages
beyond others, and did not owe it wholly
to their Mistakes, look big, and seem to
fancy themselves to be the more valuable
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53806:68"/>
on that account, and imagine that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
is due to them for the sake of a rich
Garment, to which they would not have
pretended, if they had been more mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cloathed; and they resent it as an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
if that respect is not paid them. It
is also a great folly to be taken with these
outward Marks of Respect, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
nothing: For what true or real Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
can one find in this, that another
Man stands bare, or makes Legs to
him? Will the bending another Man's
Thighs give yours an ease? And will
his Head's being bare, cure the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of yours? And yet it is wonderful to
see how this false Notion of Pleasure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witches
many, who delight themselves
with the fancy of their Nobility, and are
pleased with this Conceit, that they are
descended from Ancestors, who have been
held for some Successions rich, and that
they have had great Possessions; for this
is all that makes Nobility at present; yet
they do not think themselves a whit the
less noble, tho their immediate Parents
have left none of this Wealth to them;
or tho they themselves have squandred it
all away. The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi> have no better
Opinion of those, who are much taken
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53806:68"/>
with Gems and Precious Stones, and who
account it a degree of Happiness, next to
a Divine one, if they can purchase one
that is very extraordinary; especially if
it be of that sort of Stones, that is then
in greatest request; for the same sort is
not at all times of the same value with all
sorts of People; nor will Men buy it,
unless it be dismounted and taken out of
the Gold: And then the Jeweller is made
to give good Security, and required solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to swear that the Stone is true, that by
such an exact Caution, a false one may not
be bought instead of a true: Whereas if
you were to examine it, your Eye could
find no difference between that which is
counterfeit, and that which is true; so
that they are all one to you as much as if
you were blind: And can it be thought
that they who heap up an useless Mass of
Wealth, not for any use that it is to bring
them, but meerly to please themselves
with the contemplation of it, enjoy any
true Pleasure in it? The Delight they
find, is only a false shadow of Joy: those
are no better, whose Error is somewhat
different from the former, and who hide it,
out of their fear of losing it; for what
other Name can fit the hiding it in the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53806:69"/>
Earth, or rather the restoring it to it
again, it being thus cut off from being
useful, either to its Owner, or to the rest
of Mankind? and yet the Owner having
hid it carefully, is glad, because he thinks
he is now sure of it. And in case one
should come to steal it, the Owner, tho
he might live perhaps ten Years after that,
would all that while after the Theft, of
which he knew nothing, find no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between his having it, or losing it, for
both ways it was equally useless to him.</p>
                  <p>Among those foolish pursuers of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
they reckon all those that delight in
Hunting, or Birding, or Gaming: Of
whose madness they have only heard, for
they have no such things among them:
but they have asked us; What sort of
Pleasure is it that Men can find in throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Dice? for if there were any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in it, they think the doing it so often
should give one a Surfeit of it: And what
pleasure can one find in hearing the bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and howling of Dogs, which seem
rather odious than pleasant sounds? Nor
can they comprehend the pleasure of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dogs run after a Hare, more than of
seeing one Dog run after another; for you
have the same entertainment to the Eye
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53806:69"/>
on both these Occasions; if the seeing
them run is that which gives the pleasure,
since that is the same in both cases: but if
the Pleasure lies in seeing the Hare killed
and torn by the Dogs, this ought rather
to stir pity, when a weak, harmless, and
fearful Hare, is devoured by a strong,
fierce, and cruel Dog. Therefore all this
business of hunting, is among the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
turned over to their Butchers; and
those are all Slaves, as was formerly said:
and they look on Hunting, as one of the
basest parts of a Butcher's work: for they
account it both more profitable, and
more decent to kill those Beasts that are
more necessary and useful to Mankind;
whereas the killing and tearing of so
small and miserable an Animal, which a
Huntsman proposes to himself, can only
attract him with the false shew of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
for it is of little use to him: they
look on the desire of the Bloodshed, even
of Beasts, as a mark of a Mind that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
corrupted with cruelty, or that at
least by the frequent returns of so brutal
a pleasure, must degenerate into it.</p>
                  <p>Thus tho the Rabble of Mankind looks
upon these, and all other things of this
kind, which are indeed innumerable,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53806:70"/>
as Pleasures; the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi> on the contrary
observing, that there is nothing in the
nature of them that is truly pleasant,
conclude that they are not to be reckoned
among Pleasures: for tho these things
may create some tickling in the Senses,
(which seems to be a true Notion of
Pleasure) yet they reckon that this does
not arise from the thing it self, but from a
depraved Custom, which may so vitiate a
Man's taste, that bitter things may pass
for sweet; as Women with Child think
Pitch or Tallow taste sweeter than Hony;
but as a Man's Sense when corrupted, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a Disease, or some ill Habit, does
not change the nature of other things, so
neither can it change the nature of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p>They reckon up several sorts of these
Pleasures, which they call true Ones:
Some belong to the Body, and others to
the Mind. The Pleasures of the Mind lie
in Knowledg, and in that delight which
the contemplation of Truth carries with
it; to which they add the joyful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on a well-spent Life, and the
assured hopes of a future Happiness. They
divide the Pleasures of the Body into two
sorts; the one is that which gives our
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53806:70"/>
Senses some real delight, and is performed,
either by the recruiting of Nature, and
supplying those parts on which the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
heat of Life feeds; and that is done
by eating or drinking: Or when Nature
is eased of any surcharge that oppresses it,
as when we empty our Guts, beget Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or free any of the parts of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
from Aches or Heats by friction.
There is another kind of this sort of
Pleasure, that neither gives us any thing
that our Bodies require, nor frees us from
any thing with which we are overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
and yet it excites our Senses by a
secret unseen Vertue, and by a generous
Impression, it so tickles and affects them,
that it turns them inwardly upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and this is the Pleasure begot by
Musick. Another sort of bodily Pleasure
is, that which consists in a quiet and good
constitution of Body, by which there is
an entire healthiness spread over all the
parts of the Body, not allayed with any
Disease. This, when it is free from all
mixture of pain, gives an inward pleasure
of it self, even tho it should not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by any external and delighting Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
and altho this Pleasure does not so
vigorously affect the Sense, nor act so
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53806:71"/>
strongly upon it; yet as it is the greatest
of all Pleasures, so almost all the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
reckon it the Foundation and Basis of
all the other Joys of Life; since this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
makes one's state of Life to be easy
and desirable; and when this is wanting,
a Man is really capable of no other Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
They look upon indolence and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from Pain, if it does not rise from a
perfect Health, to be a state of Stupidity
rather than of Pleasure. There has been
a Controversy in this Matter very narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
canvassed among them; Whether a
firm and entire Health could be called a
Pleasure, or not? Some have thought
that there was no Pleasure, but that which
was excited by some sensible Motion in the
Body. But this Opinion has been long
ago run down among them, so that now
they do almost all agree in this, That
Health is the greatest of all bodily Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
and that as there is a Pain in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which is as opposite in its nature to
Pleasure, as Sickness it self is to Health,
so they hold that Health carries a Pleasure
along with it: And if any should say,
that Sickness is not really a Pain, but that
it only carries a Pain along with it, they
look upon that as a fetch of subtilty, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53806:71"/>
does not much alter the Matter. So they
think it is all one, whether it be said, that
Health is in it self a Pleasure, or that it
begets a Pleasure, as Fire gives Heat; so
it be granted, that all those whose Health
is entire, have a true pleasure in it: And
they reason thus, What is the Pleasure of
eating, but that a Man's Health which had
been weakned, does, with the assistance
of Food, drive away Hunger, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting
it self, recovers its former Vigour?
And being thus refresh'd, it finds a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in that Conflict: and if the Conflict
is Pleasure, the Victory must yet breed a
greater Pleasure, except we will fancy
that it becomes stupid as soon as it has
obtained that which it pursued, and so
does neither know nor rejoice in its own
welfare. If it is said, that Health cannot
be felt, they absolutely deny that, for
what Man is in Health, that does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it when he is awake? Is there any
Man that is so dull and stupid, as not to
acknowledg that he feels a delight in
Health? And what is Delight, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
name for Pleasure?</p>
                  <p>But of all Pleasures, they esteem those
to be the most valuable that lie in the
Mind; and the chief of these, are those
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53806:72"/>
that arise out of true Vertue, and the
witness of a good Conscience: They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Health the chief Pleasure that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Body; for they think that the
pleasure of eating and drinking, and all
the other delights of the Body, are only
so far desirable, as they give or maintain
Health: but they are not pleasant in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
otherwise than as they resist those
Impressions that our natural Infirmity is
still making upon us: And as a wise Man
desires rather to avoid Diseases, than to
take Physick; and to be freed from pain,
rather than to find ease by Remedies: so
it were a more desirable state, not to need
this sort of Pleasure, than to be obliged
to indulge it: And if any Man imagines
that there is a real Happiness in this Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
he must then confess that he would
be the happiest of all Men, if he were to
lead his life in a perpetual hunger, thirst,
and itching, and by consequence in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
eating, drinking, and scratching
himself, which any one may easily see
would be not only a base, but a miserable
state of Life. These are indeed the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of Pleasures, and the least pure: for
we can never relish them, but when they
are mixed with the contrary pains. The
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53806:72"/>
pain of Hunger, must give us the pleasure
of Eating; and here the Pain outballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the Pleasure: and as the Pain is more
vehement, so it lasts much longer; for as it
is upon us before the Pleasure comes, so it
does not cease, but with the Pleasure that
extinguishes it, and that goes off with it:
So that they think none of those Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
are to be valued, but as they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
Yet they rejoice in them, and
with due gratitude acknowledg the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of the great Author of Nature,
who has planted in us Appetites, by which
those things that are necessary for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
are likewise made pleasant to us.
For how miserable a thing would Life be,
if those daily Diseases of Hunger and
Thirst, were to be carried off by such
bitter Drugs, as we must use for those
Diseases that return seldomer upon us?
and thus these pleasant, as well as proper
Gifts of Nature, do maintain the strength
and the sprightliness of our Bodies.</p>
                  <p>They do also entertain themselves with
the other Delights that they let in at their
Eyes, their Ears, and their Nostrils, as the
pleasant relishes and seasonings of Life,
which Nature seems to have marked out
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                        <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:53806:73"/>
to be seen a greater encrease, both of
Corn and Cattel, nor are there any
where healthier Men to be found, and
freer from Diseases than among them: for
one may see there, not only such things put
in practice, that Husbandmen do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
for manuring and improving an ill
Soil, but in some places a whole Wood is
plucked up by the Roots, as well as whole
ones planted in other places, where there
were formerly none: In doing of this the
cheif consideration they have is of carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
that their Timber may be either
near their Towns, or lie upon the Sea, or
some Rivers, so that it may be floated to
them; for it is a harder work to carry
Wood at any distance over Land, then
Corn. The Peole are industrious, apt to
learn, as well as chearful and pleasant;
and none can endure more labour, when
it is necessary, than they; but except in
that case they love their ease. They are
unwearied pursuers of knowledg; for
when we had given them some hints of the
Learning and Discipline of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
concerning whom we only instructed
them, (for we know that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
among the <hi>Romans,</hi> except their,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53806:73"/>
Historians and their Poets, that they would
value much) it was strange to see how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
they were set on learning that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
We began to read a little of it to
them, rather in compliance with their
importunity, than out of any hopes of their
profiting much by it: But after a very
short trial, we found they made such a
progress in it, that we saw our labour
was like to be more successful than we
could have expected. They learned to
write their Characters, and to pronounce
their Language so right, and took up all
so quick, they remembered it so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and became so ready and correct in
the use of it, that it would have look'd like
a Miracle, if the greater part of those
whom we taught had not been Men, both
of extraordinay Capacity, and of a fit Age
for it: They were for the greatest part
chosen out among their learned Men, by
their cheif Council, tho some learn'd it of
their own accord. In three Years time
they became Masters of the whole Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
so that they read the best of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Authors very exactly. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
apt to think, that they learned
that Language the more easily, because it
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53806:74"/>
seems to be of kin to their own: I believe
that they were a Colony of the <hi>Greeks;</hi>
for tho their Language comes nearer the
<hi>Persian,</hi> yet they retain many Names, both
for their Towns and Magistrates, that are
of Greek Origination. I had happened to
carry a great many Books with me, instead
of Merchandise, when I failed my fourth
Voyage; for I was so far from thinking of
coming back soon, that I rather thought
never to have returned at all, and I gave
them all my Books, among which many of
<hi>Plato</hi>'s and some of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s works were.
I had also <hi>Theophrastus</hi> of the Plants, which
to my great regret, was imperfect; for
having laid it carelessly by, while we
were at Sea, a Monkey had fallen upon it
and had torn out leaves in many places.
They have no Books of Grammar, but
<hi>Lascares,</hi> for I did not carry <hi>Theodorus</hi>
with me; nor have they any Dictionaries
but <hi>Hesichius</hi> and <hi>Dioscorides.</hi> They e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
<hi>Plutarch</hi> highly, and were much
taken with <hi>Lucian</hi>'s Wit, and with his
pleasant way of writing. As for the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
they have <hi>Aristophanes, Homer, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides,</hi>
and <hi>Sophocles</hi> of <hi>Aldus</hi>'s Edition;
and for Historians, they have <hi>Thucidydes,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53806:74"/>
Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Herodian.</hi> One of my
Companions, <hi>Thricius Apinatus,</hi> happened
to carry with him some of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s
Works, and <hi>Galen's Microtechne,</hi> which
they hold in great estimation; for tho
there is no Nation in the World, that
needs Physick so little as they do, yet
there is not any that honours it so much:
They reckon the knowledg of it to be one
of the pleasantest and profitablest parts of
Philosophy, by which, as they search
into the Secrets of Nature, so they not
only find marvellous pleasure in it, but
think that in making such enquiries, they
do a most acceptable thing to the Author
of Nature; and imagine that he, as all
Inventers of curious Engines, has exposed
to our view this great Machine of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
we being the only Creatures capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of contemplating it: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an exact and curious Observer and
Admirer of his Workmanship, is much
more acceptable to him, than one of the
Herd; who as if he were a Beast, and
not capable of Reason, looks on all this
glorious Scene, only as a dull and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
Spectator.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:53806:75"/>
The Minds of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians,</hi> when they
are once excited by Learning, are very
ingenious in finding out all such Arts as
tend to the conveniences of Life. Two
things they owe to us, which are the Art
of Printing, and the Manufacture of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
yet they do not owe these so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to us, but that a great part of the
invention was their own; for after we
had shewed them some Paper-books of
<hi>Aldus</hi>'s Impression, and began to explain
to them the way of making Paper, and
of printing, tho we spake but very crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of both these, not being practised in
either of them, they presently took up
the whole matter from the hints that we
gave them: and whereas before they only
writ on Parchment, or on the Barks of
Trees, or Reeds; they have now set up
the Manufacture of Paper, and Printing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses:
and tho at first they could not
arrive at a perfection in them, yet by
making many essays, they at last found
out, and corrected all their Errors, and
brought the whole thing to perfection;
so that if they had but a good number of
Greek Authors, they would be quickly
supplied with many Copies of them: at
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53806:75"/>
present; tho they have no more than those
I have mentioned, yet by several Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
they have multiplied them into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands. If any Man should go
among them, that had some extraordinary
Talent, or that by much travelling had
observed the Customs of many Nations,
(which made us to be so well received)
he would be very welcome to them; for
they are very desirous to know the state
of the whole World. Very few go
among them on the account of Traffick,
for what can a Man carry to them but
Iron, or Gold, or Silver, which Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
desire rather to export, than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to any strange Country: and as for
their Exportation, they think it better to
manage that themselves, than to let For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners
come and deal in it, for by this
means, as they understand the state of the
neighbouring Countries better, so they
keep up the Art of Navigation, which
cannot be maintained but by much pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
in it.</p>

                  <head>Of their Slaves, and of their Marriages.</head>
                  <p>THEY do not make Slaves of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
of War, except those that
are taken fighting against them; nor
of the Sons of their Slaves, nor of the
Slaves of other Nations: the Slaves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, are only such as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to that state of Life for some
Crime that they had committed, or which
is more common, such as their Merchants
find condemned to die in those parts to
which they trade, whom they redeem
sometimes at low rates; and in other
places they have them for nothing; and
so they fetch them away. All their Slaves
are kept at perpetual labour, and are
always chained, but with this difference, that
they treat their own Natives much worse,
looking on them as a more profligate sort
of People; who not being restrained
from Crimes, by the advantages of so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
an Education, are judged worthy
of harder usage than others. Another
sort of Slaves, is, when some of the
poorer sort in the neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
offer of their own accord to come
and serve them; they treat these better,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53806:76"/>
and use them in all other respects, as well
as their own Country Men, except that
they impose more labour upon them,
which is no hard task to them that have
been accustomed to it; and if any of
these have a mind to go back to their
own Country, which indeed falls out but
seldom, as they do not force them to stay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so they do not send them away empty
handed.</p>
                  <p>I have already told you with what care
they look after their Sick, so that nothing
is left undone that can contribute either
to their Ease or Health: and for those who
are taken with fixed and incurable Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
they use all possible ways to cherish
them, and to make their Lives as comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
as may be: they visit them often,
and take great pains to make their time
pass off easily: but when any is taken
with a torturing and lingering pain, so
that there is no hope, either of recovery
or ease, the Priests and Magistrates come
and exhort them, that since they are now
unable to go on with the business of Life,
and are become a burden to themselves,
and to all about them, so that they have
really out-lived themselves, they would
no longer nourish such a rooted Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53806:77"/>
but would chuse rather to die, since
they cannot live, but in much mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
being assured, that if they either
deliver themselves from their Prison
and Torture, or are willing that others
should do it, they shall be happy after
their Deaths: And since by their dying
thus, they lose none of the Pleasures,
but only the Troubles of Life; they
think they act, not only reasonably in so
doing, but religiously and piously; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they follow the Advices that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them by the Priests, who are the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders
of the Will of God to them.
Such as are wrought on by these Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
do either starve themselves of their
own accord, or they take <hi>Opium,</hi> and so they
die without pain. But no Man is forced on
this way of ending his Life; and if they
cannot be perswaded to it, they do not
for that fail in their attendance and care
of them: But as they believe that a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Death, when it is chosen upon
such an Authority, is very honourable; so
if any Man takes away his own Life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the approbation of the Priests and
the Senate, they give him none of the
Honours of a decent Funeral, but throw
his Body into some Ditch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:53806:77"/>
Their Women are not married before
eighteen, nor their Men before two and
twenty; and if any of them run into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Embraces before their Marriage,
they are severely punished, and the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of Marriage is denied them, unless
there is a special Warrant obtained for it
afterward from the Prince. Such Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
cast a great reproach upon the Master
and Mistress of the Family in which they
fall out; for it is supposed, that they have
been wanting to their Duty. The reason
of punishing this so severely, is, because
they think that if they were not so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
restrained from all vagrant Appetites,
very few would engage in a married state,
in which Men venture the quiet of their
whole Life, being restricted to one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
besides many other Inconveniences
that do accompany it. In the way of
chusing of their Wives, they use a method
that would appear to us very absurd and
ridiculous, but is constantly observed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, and accounted a wise and
good Rule. Before Marriage, some grave
Matron presents the Bride naked, whether
she is a Virgin or a Widow, to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom;
and after that, some grave Man
presents the Bridegroom naked to the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53806:78"/>
Bride. We indeed both laughed at this,
and condemned it as a very indecent
thing. But they, on the other hand,
wondered at the folly of the Men of all
other Nations; who if they are but to
buy a Horse of a small value, are so cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
that they will see every part of him,
and take off both his Sadle, and all his
other Tackle, that there may be no secret
Ulcer hid under under any of them; and
that yet in the choice of a Wife, on which
depends the happiness or unhappiness of
the rest of his Life, a Man should ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon trust, and only see about an
handbreadth of the Face, all the rest of the
Body being covered; under which there
may lie hid that which may be contagious,
as well as loathsome. All Men are not so
wise, that they chuse a Woman only for
her good Qualities; and even wise Men
consider the Body, as that which adds not
a little to the Mind: And it is certain,
there may be some such deformity covered
with ones Clothes, as may totally alienate
a Man from his Wife, when it is too late
to part with her: for if such a thing is
discovered after Marriage, a Man has no
remedy but patience: So they think it is
reasonable, that there should be a good
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53806:78"/>
provision made against such mischievous
Frauds.</p>
                  <p>There was so much the more reason in
making a regulation in this Matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are the only People of those
parts that do neither allow of Polygamy,
nor of Divorces, except in the cases of
Adultery, or insufferable Perversness:
for in these Cases the Senate dissolves the
Marriage, and grants the injured Person
leave to marry again; but the Guilty are
made infamous, and are never allowed
the privilege of a second Marriage.
None are suffered to put away their
Wives against their Wills, because of any
great Calamity that may have fallen on
their Person; for they look on it as the
height of Cruelty and Treachery to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
either of the married Persons,
when they need most the tender care of
their Consort; and that chiefly in the
case of old Age, which as it carries many
Diseases along with it, so it is a Disease of
it self. But it falls often out, that when
a married Couple do not agree well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they by mutual consent separate,
and find out other Persons with whom
they hope they may live more happily:
yet this is not done, without obtaining
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53806:79"/>
leave of the Senate; which never admits
of a Divorce, but upon a strict enquiry
made, both by the Senators and their
Wives, into the Grounds upon which it
proceeds: and even when they are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
concerning the Reasons of it, they
go on but slowly, for they reckon that
too great easiness, in granting leave for
new Marriages, would very much shake
the kindness of married Persons. They pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
severely those that defile the Marriage-Bed:
If both Parties are married, they are
divorced, and the injured Persons may
marry one another, or whom they please;
but the Adulterer, and the Adulteress are
condemned to slavery. Yet if either of
the injured Persons cannot shake off the
Love of the married Person, they may
live with them still in that state; but they
must follow them to that Labour to
which the Slaves are condemned; and
sometimes the Repentance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Person, together with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken
kindness of the innocent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
Person, has prevailed so far with
the Prince, that he has taken off the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
But those that relapse, after they
are once pardoned, are punished with
Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:53806:79"/>
Their Law does not determine the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for other Crimes; but that is
left to the Senate, to temper it according
to the Circumstances of the Fact. Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
have power to correct their Wives,
and Parents to correct their Children, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the Fault is so great, that a publick
Punishment is thought necessary for the
striking terror into others. For the most
part, Slavery is the punishment even of
the greatest Crimes; for as that is no less
terrible to the Criminals themselves than
Death; so they think the preserving them
in a state of servitude, is more for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Common-Wealth, than the
killing them outright; since as their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is a greater benefit to the Publick,
than their Death could be; so the sight of
their Misery is a more lasting terror to
other Men, than that which would be
given by their Death. If their Slaves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
and will not bear their Yoke, and
submit to the Labour that is enjoined
them, they are treated as wild Beasts that
cannot be kept in order, neither by a
Prison, nor by their Chains; and are at
last put to death. But those who bear
their Punishment patiently, and are so
much wrought on by that pressure, that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53806:80"/>
lies so hard on them, that it appears they
are really more troubled for the Crimes
they have committed, than for the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
they suffer, are not out of hope, but
that at last either the Prince will, by his
Prerogative, or the People will by their
intercession restore them again to their
liberty, or at least very much mitigate
their slavery. He that tempts a married
Woman to Adultery, is no less severely
punished, than he that commits it; for
they reckon that a laid and studied Design
of committing any Crime, is equal to the
Fact it self; since its not taking effect does
not make the Person that did all that in
him lay in order to it, a whit the less
guilty.</p>
                  <p>They take great pleasure in Fools, and
as it is thought a base and unbecoming
thing to use them ill, so they do not
think it amiss for People to divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their Folly: and they think
this is a great advantage to the Fools
themselves: For if Men were so sullen
and severe, as not at all to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their ridiculous behaviour,
and foolish sayings, which is all that they
can do to recommend themselves to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
it could not be expected that they
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53806:80"/>
would be so well look'd to, nor so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
used as they must otherwise be. If
any Man should reproach another for his
being mishaped or imperfect in any part
of his Body, it would not at all be thought
a reflection on the Person that were so
treated, but it would be accounted a very
unworthy thing for him that had upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
another with that which he could not
help. It is thought a sign of a sluggish
and sordid Mind, not to preserve careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one's natural Beauty; but it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
an infamous thing among them to
use Paint or Fard. And they all see that
no Beauty recommends a Wife so much to
her Husband, as the probity of her Life,
and her Obedience: for as some few are
catched and held only by Beauty, so all
People are held by the other Excellencies
which charm all the World.</p>
                  <p>As they fright Men from committing
Crimes by Punishments, so they invite
them to the love of Vertue, by publick
Honours: therefore they erect Statues in
honour to the memories of such worthy
Men as have deserved well of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and set these in their Market-places,
both to perpetuate the remembrance of
their Actions, and to be an incitement
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53806:81"/>
to their Posterity to follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>If any Man aspires to any Office, he is
sure never to compass it: They live all
easily together, for none of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
are either insolent or cruel to the
People; but they affect rather to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Fathers,</hi> and by being really so, they
well deserve that Name; and the People
pay them all the marks of Honour the
more freely, because none are exacted of
them. The Prince himself has no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
either of Garments, or of a
Crown; but is only known by a Sheaf
of Corn that is carried before him, as the
High Priest is also known by a Wax Light
that is carried before him.</p>
                  <p>They have but few Laws, and such is
their Constitution, that they need not
many. They do very much condemn
other Nations, whose Laws, together
with the Commentaries on them, swell
up to so many Volumes; for they think
it an unreasonable thing to oblige Men to
obey a Body of Laws, that are both of
such a bulk, and so dark, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be read or understood by every one
of the Subjects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:53806:81"/>
They have no Lawyers among them,
for they consider them as a sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whose Profession it is to disguise Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as well as to wrest Laws; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they think it is much better that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man should plead his own Cause, and
trust it to the Judg, as well as in other
places the Client does it to a Counsellor.
By this means they both cut off many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
and find out Truth more certainly:
for after the Parties have laid open the
Merits of their Cause, without those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
which Lawyers are apt to suggest,
the Judg examines the whole Matter, and
supports the simplicity of such well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Persons, whom otherwise crafty Men
would be sure to run down: And thus
they avoid those Evils, which appear very
remarkably among all those Nations that
labour under a vast load of Laws. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them is skilled in their Law, for
as it is a very short study, so the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
meaning of which words are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is always the sense of their Laws.
And they argue thus; All Laws are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated
for this end, that every Man
may know his Duty; and therefore the
plainest and most obvious sense of the
words, is that which must be put on them;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53806:82"/>
since a more refined Exposition cannot be
easily comprehended, and Laws become
thereby useless to the greater part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
who need most the direction of
them: for to them it is all one, not to
make a Law at all, and to couch it in
such tearms, that without a quick appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
and much study, a Man cannot
find out the true meaning of it; and the
generality of Mankind are both so dull,
and so much imployed in their several
Trades, that they have neither the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
nor the capacity requisite for such an
enquiry.</p>
                  <p>Some of their Neighbours, who are
Masters of their own Liberties, having
long ago, by the assistance of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
shaken off the Yoke of Tyranny;
and being much taken with those Vertues
that they observe among them, have come
to them, and desired that they would send
Magistrates among them to govern them;
some changing them every Year, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
every five Years. At the end of
their Government, they bring them back
to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> with great expressions of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and esteem, and carry away others
to govern in their stead. In this they
seem to have fallen upon a very good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53806:82"/>
for their own happiness and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
For since the good or ill Condition
of a Nation depends so much upon their
Magistrates, they could not have made a
better choice, than by pitching on Men
whom no Advantages can biass; for
Wealth is of no use to them, since they
must go so soon back to their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and they being strangers among
them, are not engaged in any of their
Heats or Animosities: And it is certain,
that when Publick Judicatories are sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
either by partial Affections, or by
Avarice, there must follow upon it a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of all Justice, which is the chief
Sinew of Society.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi> call those Nations that
come and ask Magistrates from them,
<hi>Neighbours;</hi> but they call those to whom
they have been more particularly assisting,
<hi>Friends.</hi> And whereas all other Nations
are perpetually either making Leagues, or
breaking them, they never enter into any
Alliance with any other State. They think
Leagues are useless things, and reckon,
that if the common Ties of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
do not knit Men together, the Faith
of Promises will have no great effect on
them: And they are the more confirmed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53806:83"/>
in this, by that which they see among the
Nations round about them, who are no
strict observers of Leagues and Treaties.
We know how religiously they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in <hi>Europe;</hi> more particularly where
the Christian Doctrine is received, among
whom they are sacred and inviolable.
Which is partly owing to the Justice and
Goodness of the Princes themselves, and
partly to their Reverence that they pay
to the Popes: who as they are most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
observers of their own Promises, so
they exhort all other Princes to perform
theirs; and when fainter Methods do not
prevail, they compel them to it by the
severity of the Pastoral Censure; and
think that it would be the most indecent
thing possible, if Men who are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
designed by the title of <hi>the Faithful,</hi>
should not religiously keep the <hi>Faith</hi> of
their Treaties. But in that new found
World, which is not more distant from
us in Scituation, than it is disagreeing from
us in their Manners, and course of Life,
there is no trusting to Leagues, even tho
they were made with all the pomp of the
most Sacred Ceremonies that is possible:
On the contrary, they are the sooner bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for that, some slight Pretence being
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53806:83"/>
found in the words of the Treaties, which
are contrived in such ambiguous Terms,
and that on design, that they can never
be so strictly bound, but they will always
find some Loop-hole to escape at; and so
they break both their Leagues and their
Faith. And this is done with that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that those very Men who value
themselves on having suggested these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to their Princes, would yet, with a
haughty scorn, declaim against such
Craft, or to speak plainer, such Fraud
and Deceit, if they found private Men
make use of it in their Bargains; and
would readily say, that they deserved to
be hanged for it.</p>
                  <p>By this means it is, that all sort of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
passes in the World, but for a low-spirited
and vulgar Vertue, which is far
below the dignity of Royal Greatness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Or at least, there are two sorts of Justice
set up: the one is mean, and creeps on the
Ground, and therefore becomes none but
the baser sort of Men, and so must be
kept in severely by many restraints, that
it may not break out beyond the Bounds
that are set to it. The other is, the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
Vertue of Princes, which as it is more
majestick than that which becomes the,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53806:84"/>
Rabble, so takes a freer compass; and
lawful or unlawful, are only measured by
Pleasure and Interest. These practices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Princes that lie about <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi>
who make so little account of their Faith,
seem to be the Reasons that determine
them to engage in no Confederacies: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they would change their mind if they
lived among us: but yet tho Treaties
were more religiously observed, they
would still dislike the custom of making
them; since the World has taken up a
false Maxim upon it, as if there were no
tie of Nature knitting one Nation to
another, that are only separated perhaps by
a Mountain, or a River, and that all were
born in a state of Hostility, and so might
lawfully do all that mischief to their
Neighbours, against which there is no
provision made by Treaties: And that
when Treaties are made, they do not cut
off the Enmity, or restrain the License
of preying upon one another, if by the
unskilfulness of wording them, there are
not effectual <hi>Proviso's</hi> made against them.
They on the other hand judg, that no
Man is to be esteemed our Enemy that has
never injured us; and that the Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Humane Nature, that is
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53806:84"/>
among all Men, is instead of a League.
And that kindness and good Nature unite
Men more effectually, and more forcibly
than any Agreements whatsoever; since
thereby the Engagements of Mens Hearts
become stronger, than any thing can
be to which a few words can bind them.</p>

                  <head>Of their Military Discipline.</head>
                  <p>THey detest War as a very brutal
thing; and which, to the reproach
of Humane Nature, is more practised by
Men, than by any sort of Beasts: and
they, against the custom of almost all
other Nations, think that there is nothing
more inglorious than that Glory that is
gained by War: And therefore tho they
accustom themselves daily to Military Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
and the Discipline of War, in
which not only their Men, but their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
likewise, are trained up, that so in
cases of Necessity, they may not be quite
useless: Yet they do not rashly engage in
War, unless it be either to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or their Friends, from any unjust
Aggressors; or out of good Nature, or in
compassion to an oppressed Nation, that
they assist them to the shaking off the Yoke
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53806:85"/>
Tyranny. They indeed help their Friends,
not only in Defensive, but also in Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Wars: but they never do that, unless
they had been consulted with while the
Matter was yet entire; and that being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the Grounds on which they
went, they had found that all Demands
of Reparation were rejected, so that a
War was necessary: which they do not
think to be only just, when one Neighbour
makes an inrode on another, by publick
Order, and carries away their Spoils; but
when the Merchants of one Country are
oppressed in another, either under the
pretence of some unjust Laws, or by the
perverse wresting of good ones: this they
count a juster cause of War than the
other, because those Injuries are done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
some colour of Laws. This was the
only Ground of that War, in which they
engaged with the <hi>Nephelogetes</hi> against the
<hi>Aleopolitanes,</hi> a little before our time: for
the Merchants of the former, having, as
they thought, met with great injustice
among the latter, that, whether it was in
it self right or wrong, did draw on a
terrible War, many of their Neighbours
being engaged in it; and their keenness in
carrying it on, being supported by their
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53806:85"/>
strength in maintaining it; it not only
shook some very flourishing States, and
very much afflicted others; but after a
series of much Mischief, it ended in the
entire conquest and slavery of the <hi>Aleopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litanes,</hi>
who tho before the War, they
were in all respects much superior to the
<hi>Nephelogetes,</hi> yet by it they fell under their
Empire; But the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians,</hi> tho they had
assisted them in the War, yet pretended to
no share of the spoil.</p>
                  <p>But tho they assist their Friends so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously,
in taking reparation for Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that are done them in such Matters;
yet if they themselves should meet with
any such fraud, provided there were no
violence done to their Persons, they
would only carry it so far, that unless sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
were made, they would give
over trading with such a People. This is
not done, because they consider their
Neighbours more than their own Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens;
but since their Neighbours trade
every one upon his own Stock, Fraud is
a more sensible injury to them, than it is
to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians,</hi> among whom the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
only suffers in such a case: And since
they expect nothing in return for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
that they export; but that in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53806:86"/>
which they abound so much, and is of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
use to them, the loss does not much
affect them; therefore they think it would
be too severe a thing to revenge a Loss
that brings so little inconvenience with it,
either to their Life, or their Livelihood,
with the death of many People: but if
any of their People is either killed or
wounded wrongfully, whether that be
done by Publick Authority, or only by
private Men, as soon as they hear of it,
they send Ambassadors, and demand, that
the Guilty Persons may be delivered up
to them; and if that is denied, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
War; but if that is done, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
those either to Death or Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                  <p>They would be both troubled and asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of a <hi>bloody Victory</hi> over their Enemies;
and think it would be as foolish a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase,
as to buy the most valuable Goods
at too high a Rate. And in no Victory
do they glory so much, as in that which is
gained by dexterity and good conduct,
without Bloodshed. They appoint pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Triumphs in such Cases, and erect
Trophies to the honour of those who
have succeeded well in them; for then
do they reckon that a Man acts sutably to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53806:86"/>
his Nature, when he conquers his Enemy
in such a way, that no other Creature but
a Man could be capable of it, and that is,
by the strength of his Understanding.
Bears, Lions, Boars, Wolves, and Dogs,
and other Animals, imploy their bodily
Force one against another, in which as
many of them are superior to Man, both
in strength and fierceness, so they are all
subdued by the reason and understanding
that is in him.</p>
                  <p>The only Design of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi> in
War, is to obtain that by Force, which if
it had been granted them in time, would
have prevented the War; or if that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done, to take so severe a Revenge
of those that have injured them, that they
may be terrified from doing the like in
all time coming. By these Ends they
measure all their Designs, and manage
them so, that it is visible that the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
of Fame or Vain-glory, does not
work so much on them, as a just care of
their own Security.</p>
                  <p>As soon as they declare War, they take
care to have a great many Schedules, that
are sealed with their Common Seal, affixed
in the most conspicuous places of their
Enemies Country. This is carried secretly,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53806:87"/>
and done in many places all at once. In
those they promise great Rewards to such
as shall kill the Prince, and lesser in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to such as shall kill any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who are those on whom, next to the
Prince himself, they cast the chief blame
of the War. And they double the Sum
to him, that instead of killing the Person
so marked out, shall take him alive, and
put him in their hands. They offer not
only Indemnity, but Rewards, to such of
the Persons themselves that are so marked,
if they will act against their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
By this means those that are named
in their Schedules, become not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustful
of their Fellow-Citizens, but are
jealous of one another: and are much
distracted by Fear and Danger; for it has
often fallen out, that many of them, and
even the Prince himself, have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by those in whom they have trusted
most: for the Rewards that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi>
offer, are so unmeasurably great, that there
is no sort of Crime to which Men cannot
be drawn by them. They consider the
Risque that those run, who undertake such
Services, and offer a Recompence propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to the danger; not only a vast deal
of Gold, but great Revenues in Lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:53806:87"/>
that lie among other Nations that are their
Friends, where they may go and enjoy
them very securely; and they observe the
Promises they make of this kind most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously.
They do very much approve
of this way of corrupting their Enemies,
tho it appears to others to be a base and
cruel thing; but they look on it as a
wise course, to make an end of that which
would be otherwise a great War, without
so much as hazarding one Battel to decide
it. They think it likewise an Act of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Love to Mankind, to prevent the
great slaughter of those that must other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be killed in the progress of the War,
both of their own side, and of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
by the death of a few that are most
guilty; and that in so doing, they are
kind even to their Enemies, and pity
them no less than their own People, as
knowing that the greater part of them do
not engage in the War of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
but are driven into it by the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Prince.</p>
                  <p>If this Method does not succeed with
them, then they sow Seeds of Contention
among their Enemies, and animate the
Prince's Brother, or some of the Nobility,
to aspire to the Crown. If they cannot
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53806:88"/>
disunite them by Domestick Broils, then
they engage their Neighbours against
them, and make them set on foot some
old Pretensions, which are never wanting
to Princes, when they have occasion for
them. And they supply them plentifully
with Mony, tho but very sparingly with
any Auxiliary Troops: for they are so
render of their own People, that they
would not willingly exchange one of
them, even with the Prince of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Country.</p>
                  <p>But as they keep their Gold and Silver
only for such an occasion, so when that
offers it self, they easily part with it, since
it would be no inconvenience to them,
tho they should reserve nothing of it to
themselves. For besides the Wealth that
they have among them at home, they have
a vast Treasure abroad; Many Nations
round about them, being deep in their
Debt: so that they hire Souldiers from all
Places for carrying on their Wars; but
chiefly from the <hi>Zapolets,</hi> who lie five
hundred miles from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia</hi> eastward.
They are a rude, wild, and fierce Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who delight in the Woods and
Rocks, among which they were born and
bred up. They are hardned both
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53806:88"/>
against Heat, Cold, and Labour, and
know nothing of the delicacies of Life.
They do not apply themselves to Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture,
nor do they care either for their
Houses or their Clothes. Cattel is all
that they look after; and for the greatest
part, they live either by their Hunting, or
upon Rapine; and are made, as it were,
only for War. They watch all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of engaging in it, and very readily
embrace such as are offered them. Great
numbers of them will often go out, and
offer themselves upon a very low Pay, to
serve any that will employ them: they
know none of the Arts of Life, but those
that lead to the taking it away; they
serve those that hire them, both with
much courage and great Fidelity; but
will not engage to serve for any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
time, and agree upon such Terms,
that the next day they may go over to
the Enemies of those whom they serve,
if they offer them a greater pay: and
they will perhaps return to them the day
after that, upon a higher advance of their
Pay. There are few Wars in which they
make not a considerable part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of both sides: so it falls often out,
that they that are of kin to one another,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53806:89"/>
and were hired in the same Country, and
so have lived long and familiarly together;
yet they forgetting both their Relation
and former Friendship, kill one another
upon no other consideration, but because
they are hired to it for a little Mony, by
Princes of different Interests: and so
great regard have they to Mony, that they
are easily wrought on by the difference of
one Penny a Day, to change sides. So
entirely does their Avarice turn them,
and yet this Mony on which they are so
much set, is of little use to them; for
what they purchase thus with their Blood,
they quickly waste it on Luxury, which
among them is but of a poor and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
form.</p>
                  <p>This Nation serves the <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi> hold
this for a Maxim, that as they seek out the
best sort of Men for their own use at
home, so they make use of this worst sort
of Men for the Consumption of War, and
therefore they hire them with the offers
of vast Rewards, to expose themselves to
all sorts of hazards, out of which the
greater part never returns to claim their
Promises. Yet they make them good
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53806:89"/>
most religiously to such as escape. And
this animates them to adventure again,
when there is occasion for it; for the
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi> are not at all troubled how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them soever happen to be killed;
and reckon it a service done to Mankind,
if they could be a mean to deliver the
World from such a leud and vicious sort
of People, that seem to have run toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as to the Drain of Humane Nature.
Next to these they are served in their
Wars, with those upon whose account
they undertake them, and with the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
Troops of their other Friends, to
whom they join some few of their own
People, and send some Man of eminent
and approved Vertue to command in
chief. There are two sent with him, who
during his Command, are but private
Men, but the first is to succeed him if he
should happen to be either killed or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and in case of the like misfortune
to him, the third comes in his place; and
thus they provide against ill Events, that
such Accidents as may befal their Generals,
may not endanger their Armies. When
they draw out Troops of their own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they take such out of every City as
freely offer themselves, for none are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                        <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:53806:90"/>
to the Laws of the Country, and
their Learning, add more vigor to their
Minds: for as they do not undervalue
Life to the degree of throwing it away
too prodigally; so they are not so inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
fond of it, that when they see
they must sacrifice it honourably, they
will preserve it by base and unbecoming
Methods. In the greatest heat of Action,
the bravest of their Youth, that have
jointly devoted themselves for that piece
of Service, single out the General of their
Enemies, and set on him either openly, or
lay an Ambuscade for him: if any of
them are spent and wearied in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
others come in their stead, so that
they never give over pursuing him, either
by close Weapons, when they can get near
him, or those that wound at a distance,
when others get in between: thus they
seldom fail to kill or take him at last, if
he does not secure himself by flight. When
they gain the Day in any Battel, they kill
as few as possibly they can; and are much
more set on taking many Prisoners, than
on killing those that fly before them: nor
do they ever let their Men so loose in the
pursuit of their Enemies, that they do
not retain an entire Body still in order;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53806:90"/>
so that if they have been forced to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the last of their Battalions, before they
could gain the day, they will rather let
their Enemies all escape than pursue them,
when their own Army is in disorder; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
well what has often fallen out to
themselves; that when the main Body of
their Army has been quite defeated and
broken, so that their Enemies reckoning
the Victory was sure and in their hands,
have let themselves loose into an irregular
pursuit, a few of them that lay for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
waiting a fit opportunity, have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
on them while they were in this chase,
stragling and in disorder, apprehensive of
no danger, but counting the Day their
own; and have turned the whole Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so wresting out of their hands a
Victory that seemed certain and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the vanquished have of a sudden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
victorious.</p>
                  <p>It is hard to tell whether they are more
dextrous in laying or avoiding Ambushes:
they sometimes seem to fly when it is far
from their thoughts; and when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to give Ground, they do it so, that
it is very hard to find out their Design.
If they see they are ill posted, or are like
to be overpowred by numbers, then they
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                        <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:53806:91"/>
their Friends to reimburse them of
their expence in it; but they take that
from the conquered, either in Mony which
they keep for the next occasion, or in Lands,
out of which a constant Revenue is to be
paid them; by many increases, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
which they draw out from several
Countries on such Occasions, is now risen
to above 700000 Ducats a Year. They
send some of their own People to receive
these Revenues, who have orders to live
magnificently, and like Princes, and so
they consume much of it upon the place;
and either bring over the rest to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi>
or lend it to that Nation in which it lies.
This they most commonly do, unless some
great occasion which falls out, but very
seldom, should oblige them to call for it all.
It is out of these Lands that they assign
those Rewards to such as they encourage
to adventure on desperate Attempts,
which was mentioned formerly. If any
Prince that engages in War with them, is
making preparations for invading their
Country, they prevent him, and make his
Country the Seat of the War; for they
do not willingly suffer any War to break
in upon their Island; and if that should
happen, they would only defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53806:91"/>
by their own People; but would
not at all call for Auxiliary Troops to
their assistance.</p>

                  <head>Of the Religions of the Utopians.</head>
                  <p>THere are several sorts of Religions,
not only in different parts of the
Island, but even in every Town; some
worshipping the Sun, others the Moon, or
one of the Planets: some worship such
Men as have been eminent in former
times for Vertue, or Glory, not only as
ordinary Deities, but as the supream
God: yet the greater and wiser sort of
them worship none of these, but adore one
Eternal, Invisible, Infinite, and Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
Deity; as a Being that is far
above all our Apprehensions, that is spread
over the whole Universe, not by its Bulk,
but by its Power and Vertue; him they
call the <hi>Father of all,</hi> and acknowledg
that the beginnings, the encrease, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
the vicissitudes, and the end of all
things come only from him; nor do they
offer divine honouts to any but to him
alone. And indeed, tho they differ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
other things, yet all agree in this;
that they think there is one supream Being
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53806:92"/>
that made and governs the World, whom
they call in the Language of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<hi>Mithras.</hi> They differ in this, that
one thinks the God whom he worships is
this Supream Being, and another thinks
that his Idol is that God; but they all
agree in one principle, that whatever is this
Supream Being, is also that Great Essence,
to whose Glory and Majesty all honours
are ascribed by the consent of all Nations.</p>
                  <p>By degrees, they all fall off from the
various Superstitions that are among them,
and grow up to that one Religion that is
most in request, and is much the best:
and there is no doubt to be made, but
that all the others had vanished long ago,
if it had not happned that some unlucky
Accidents, falling on those who were
advising the change of those superstitious
ways of Worship; these have been ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
not to Chance, but to somewhat from
Heaven; and so have raised in them a fear,
that the God, whose Worship was like to be
abandoned, has interposed and revenged
himself on those that designed it.</p>
                  <p>After they had heard from us, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Doctrine, the course of
Life, and the Miracles of Christ, and of
the wonderful constancy of so many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53806:92"/>
whose Blood, that was so willingly
offered up by them, was the chief oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of spreading their Religion over a
vast number of Nations; it is not to be
imagined how inclined they were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it. I shall not determine whether
this proceeded from any secret inspiration
of God, or whether it was because it
seemed so favorable to that community of
Goods, which is an opinion so particular,
as well as so dear to them; since they
perceived that Christ and his Followers
lived by that Rule; and that it was still
kept up in some Communities among the
sincerest sort of Christians, from which
soever of these Motives it might be true it
is, that many of them came over to our
Religion, and were initiated into it by
Baptism. But as two of our number were
dead, so none of the four that survived,
were in Priests Orders; therefore we
could do no more but baptize them; so
that to our great regret, they could not
partake of the other Sacraments, that
can only be administred by Priests: but
they are instructed concerning them, and
long most vehemently for them; and
they were disputing very much among
themselves, Whether one that were chosen
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53806:93"/>
by them to be a Preist, would not be
thereby qualified to do all the things that
belong to that Character, even tho he had
no Authority derived from the Pope;
and they seemed to be resolved to chuse
some for that Imployment, but they had
not done it when I left them</p>
                  <p>Those among them that have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
our Religion, yet do not fright
any from it, and use none ill that goes
over to it; so that all the while I was
there, one Man was only punished on this
occasion. He being newly baptized, did,
notwithstanding all that we could say
to the contrary, dispute publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Christian Religion, with more
zeal than discretion; and with so much
heat, that he not only preferred our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to theirs, but condemned all their
Rites as profane; and cried out against all
that adhered to them, as impious and
sacrilegious Persons, that were to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to everlasting Burnings. Upon this
he, having preached these things often,
was seized on, and after a Trial, he was
condemned to banishment, not for having
disparaged their Religion, but for his
inflaming the People to Sedition: for this
is one of their ancientest Laws, that no
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53806:93"/>
Man ought to be punished for his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
At the first constitution of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment,
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topus</hi> having understood, that
before his coming among them, the old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitans
had been engaged in <hi>grtat quarrels</hi>
concerning Religion, by which they were
so broken among themselves, that he
found it an easy thing to conquer them,
since they did not unite their Forces
against him, but every different Party in
Religion fought by themselves: upon that,
after he had subdued them, he made a
Law that every Man might be of what
Religion he pleased, and might endeavor
to draw others to it by the force of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and by amicable and modest
ways, but without bitterness against
those of other Opinions; but that he
ought to use no other Force but that of
Persuasion; and was neither to mixt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
nor Violence with it; and such
as did otherwise, were to be condemned
to Banishment or Slavery.</p>
                  <p>This Law was made by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topus,</hi> not
only for preserving the Publick Peace,
which he saw suffered much by daily Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and Irreconcilable Heats in these
Matters, but because he thought the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of Religion it self required it.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53806:94"/>
He judged it was not fit to determine any
thing rashly in that Matter; and seemed
to doubt whether those different Forms
of Religion might not all come from God,
who might inspire Men differently, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
possibly pleased with a variety in it:
and so he thought it was a very indecent
and foolish thing for any Man to frighten
and threaten other Men to believe any
thing because it seemed true to him; and
in case that one Religion were certainly
true, and all the rest false, he reckoned
that the native Force of Truth would
break forth at last, and shine bright, if it
were managed only by the strength of
Argument, and with a winning gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
whereas if such Matters were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on by Violence and Tumults, then,
as the wickedest sort of Men is always
the most obstinate, so the holiest and best
Religion in the World might be overlaid
with so much foolish superstition, that it
would be quite choaked with it, as Corn
is with Briars and Thorns; therefore he
left Men wholly to their liberty in this
matter, that they might be free to beleive
as they should see cause; only he made
a solemn and severe Law against such as
should so far degenerate from the dignity
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53806:94"/>
of humane Nature, as to think that our
Souls died with our Bodies, or that the
World was governed by Chance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a wise over-ruling Providence: for
they did all formerly believe that there
was a state of Rewards and Punishments
to the Good and Bad after this Life; and
they look on those that think otherwise,
as scarce fit to be counted Men, since
they degrade so noble a Being as our
Soul is, and reckon it to be no better
than a Beast's; so far are they from
looking on such Men as fit for humane
society, or to be Citizens of a well-ordered
Common-Wealth; since a Man
of such Principles must needs, as oft as
he dares do it, despise all their Laws and
Customs: for there is no doubt to be
made, that a Man who is affraid of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Law, and apprehends no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
after death, will not stand to break
through all the Laws of his Country,
either by fraud or force, that so he may
satisfy his Appetites. They never raise
any that hold these Maxims, either to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
or Offices, nor imploy them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
publick Trust, but despise them, as
Men of base and sordid Minds: yet they
do not punish them, because they lay this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53806:95"/>
doun for a ground, that a Man cannot
make himself beleive any thing he pleases;
nor do they drive any to dissemble their
thoughts by threatnings, so that Men are
not tempted to lie or disguise their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
among them; which being a sort of
Fraud, is abhorred by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians:</hi> they
take indeed care that they may not argue
for these Opinions, especially before the
common People: But they do suffer, and
even encourage them to dispute concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in private with their Priests, and
and other grave Men, being confident
that they will be cured of those mad
Opinions, by having reason laid before
them. There are many among them that
run far to the other extream, tho it is
neither thought an ill nor unreasonable
Opinion, and therfore is not at all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.
They think that the Souls of
Beasts are immortal, tho far inferior to
the dignity of the humane Soul, and not
capable of so great a happiness. They
are almost all of them very firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that good Men will be infinitely
happy in another state; so that tho they
are compassionate to all that are sick, yet
they lament no Man's Death, except they
see him part with Life uneasy, and as if he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53806:95"/>
were forced to it; For they look on this
as a very ill persage, as if the Soul being
conscious to it self of Guilt, and quite
hopeless, were affraid to die, from some
secret hints of approaching misery. They
think that such a Man's appearance before
God, cannot be acceptable to him, who
being called on, does not go out chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
but is backward and unwilling,
and is, as it were, dragged to it. They
are struck with horror, when they see
any die in this manner, and carry them
out in silence, and with sorrow, and
praying God that he would be merciful
to the Errors of the departed Soul,
they lay the Body in the Ground: but
when any die chearfully, and full of
hope, they do not mourn for them, but
sing Hymns when they carry out their
Bodies, and commending their Souls very
earnestly to God, in such a manner, that
their whole behaviour is rather grave
then sad, they burn their Body, and
set up a Pillar where the Pile was made,
with an Inscription to the honour of such
Mens memory; And when they come
from the Funeral, they discourse of their
good Life, and worthy Actions, but
speak of nothing oftner and with more
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                        <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:53806:96"/>
himself that happiness that comes after
Death. Some of these visit the Sick;
others mend High-ways, cleanse Ditches,
or repair Bridges, and dig Turf, Gravel,
or Stones. Others fell and cleave Timber,
and bring Wood, Corn, and other
Necessaries, on Carts, into their Towns.
Nor do these only serve the Publick, but
they serve even Private Men, more than
the Slaves themselves do: for if there is
any where a rough, hard, and sordid
piece of work to be done, from which
many are frightned by the labour and
loathsomeness of it, if not the despair of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing
it, they do chearfully, and of
their own accord, take that to their share;
and by that means, as they ease others very
much, so they afflict themselves, and spend
their whole life in hard Labor: and yet they
do not value themselves upon that, nor
lessen other peoples credit, that by so
doing they may raise their own; but by
their stooping to such sevile Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they are so far from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
that they are so much the more
esteemed by the whole Nation.</p>
                  <p>Of these there are two sorts: Some
live unmarried and chast, and abstain from
eating any sort of Flesh; and thus wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53806:96"/>
themselves from all the pleasures of
the present Life, which they account
hurtful, they pursue, even by the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
and painfullest methods possible, that
blessedness which they hope for hereafter;
and the nearer they approach to it, they
are the more chearful and earnest in their
endeavours after it. Another sort of them
is less willing to put themselves to much
toil, and so they prefer a married state to
a single one; and as they do not deny
themselves the pleasure of it, so they
think the begetting of Children is a debt
which they owe to Humane Nature, and
to their Country: nor do they avoid any
Pleasure that does not hinder Labour;
and therefore they eat Flesh so much the
more willingly, because they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so much the more able for work by
it: The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians</hi> look upon these as the
wiser Sect, but they esteem the others as
the holier. They would indeed laugh at
any Man, that upon the Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
would prefer an unmarried state to a
married, or a Life of Labour to an easy
Life: but they reverence and admire such
as do it upon a Motive of Religion.
There is nothing in which they are more
cautious, than in giving their Opinion po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53806:97"/>
concerning any sort of Religion.
The Men that lead those severe Lives, are
called in the Language of their Country
<hi>Brutheskas,</hi> which answers to those we call
<hi>Religious Orders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their Priests are Men of eminent Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and therefore they are but few, for
there are only thirteen in every Town,
one for every Temple in it; but when
they go to War, seven of these go out
with their Forces, and seven others are
chosen to supply their room in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
but these enter again upon their
Employment when they return; and
those who served in their absence, attend
upon the High Priest, till Vacancies fall
by Death; for there is one that is set over
all the rest. They are chosen by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as the other Magistrates are, by Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
given in secret, for preventing of
Factions: and when they are chosen, they
are consecrated by the College of Priests.
The care of all Sacred Things, and the
Worship of God, and an inspection into
the Manners of the People, is committed
to them. It is a reproach to a Man to be
sent for by any of them, or to be even
spoke to in secret by them, for that always
gives some suspicions: all that is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53806:97"/>
on them, is only to exhort and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
People; for the power of correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and punishing ill Men, belongs wholly
to the Prince, and to the other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates:
The severest thing that the Priest
does, is the excluding of Men that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately
wicked from joining in their
Worship: There's not any sort of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that is more dreaded by them than
this, for as it loads them with Infamy, so it
fills them with secret Horrors, such is their
reverence to their Religion; nor will
their Bodies be long exempted from their
share of trouble; for if they do not very
quickly satisfy the Priests of the truth of
their Repentance, they are seized on by
the Senate, and punished for their Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The breeding of the Youth belongs
to the Priests, yet they do not take so
much care of instructing them in Letters,
as of forming their Minds and Manners
aright; and they use all possible Methods
to infuse very early in the tender and
flexible Minds of Children, such Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as are both good in themselves, and
will be useful to their Country: for
when deep impressions of these things
are made at that Age, they follow Men
through the whole course of their Lives,
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                        <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:53806:98"/>
of much Blood on either side; and when
the Victory turns to their side, they run in
among their own Men to restrain their
Fury; and if any of their Enemies see
them, or call to them, they are preserved
by that means: and such as can come so
near them as to touch their Garments,
have not only their Lives, but their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
secured to them: It is upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that all the Nations round about
consider them so much, and pay them so
great reverence, that they have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
no less able to preserve their own
People from the fury of their Enemies,
than to save their Enemies from their
rage: for it has sometimes fallen out, that
when their Armies have been in disorder,
and forced to fly, so that their Enemies
were running upon the slaughter and
spoil, the Priests by interposing, have
stop'd the shedding of more Blood, and
have separated them from one another;
so that by their Mediation, a Peace has
been concluded on very reasonable
Terms; nor is there any Nation about
them so fierce, cruel, or barbarous, as not
to look upon their Persons as Sacred and
Inviolable.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:53806:98"/>
                  <p>The first and the last day of the Month,
and of the Year, is a Festival: they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
their Months by the course of the
Moon; and their Years by the course of
the Sun: The first days are called in
their Language the <hi>Cynemernes,</hi> and the
last the <hi>Trapemernes,</hi> which answers in
our Language to the Festival that begins,
or ends the Season.</p>
                  <p>They have magnificent Temples, that
are not only nobly built, but are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of great Reception: which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
since they have so few of them:
They are a little dark within, which flows
not from any Error in their Architecture,
but is done on design; for their Priests
think that too much light dissipates the
thoughts, and that a more moderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of it, both recollects the Mind, and
raises Devotion. Tho there are many
different Forms of Religion among them,
yet all these, how various soever, agree
in the main Point, which is the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Divine Essence; and therefore
there is nothing to be seen or heard in
their Temples, in which the several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
among them may not agree; for
every Sect performs those Rites that are
peculiar to it, in their private Houses, nor
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53806:99"/>
is there any thing in the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that contradicts the particular ways
of those different Sects. There are no
Images for God in their Temples, so that
every one may represent him to his
thoughts, according to the way of his
Religion; nor do they call this one God
by any other Name, but that of <hi>Mithras,</hi>
which is the common Name by which
they all express the Divine Essence,
whatsoever otherwise they think it to be;
nor are there any Prayers among them,
but such as every one of them may use
without prejudice to his own Opinion.</p>
                  <p>They meet in their Temples on the
Evening of the Festival that concludes
a Season: and not having yet broke
their Fast, they thank God for their
good success during that Year or Month,
which is then at an end: and the next day,
being that which begins the new Season,
they meet early in their Temples, to pray
for the happy Progress of all their Affairs
during that Period, upon which they
then enter. In the Festival which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the Period, before they go to the
Temple, both Wives and Children fall
on their Knees before their Husbands or
Parents, and confess every thing in which
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53806:99"/>
they have either erred or failed in their
Duty, and beg pardon for it: Thus all
little Discontents in Families are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that so they may offer up their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
with a pure and serene mind;
for they hold it a great impiety to enter
upon them with disturbed thoughts; or
when they are conscious to themselves
that they bear Hatred or Anger in their
Hearts to any Person; and think that
they should become liable to severe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
if they presumed to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
without cleansing their Hearts,
and reconciling all their Differences. In
the Temples, the two Sexes are separated,
the Men go to the right hand, and the
Women to the left: and the Males and
Females do all place themselves before the
Head, and Master or Mistress of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
to which they belong; so that
those who have the Government of them
at home, may see their deportment in
publick: and they intermingle them so,
that the younger and the older may be
set by one another; for if the younger
sort were all set together, they would
perhaps trifle away that time too much,
in which they ought to beget in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a most religious dread of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53806:100"/>
Being, which is the greatest, and
almost the only incitement to Vertue.</p>
                  <p>They offer up no living Creature in
Sacrifice, nor do they think it suitable to
the Divine Being, from whose Bounty it
is that these Creatures have derived their
Lives, to take pleasure in their Death, or
the offering up their Blood. They burn
Incense, and other sweet Odours, and
have a great number of Wax Lights du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their Worship; not out of any Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
that such Oblations can add any
thing to the Divine Nature, for even
Prayers do not that; but as it is a harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and pure way of worshipping God,
so they think those sweet Savors and
Lights, together with some other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
do, by a secret and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Vertue, elevate Mens Souls, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
them with more force and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
during the Divine Worship.</p>
                  <p>The People appear all in the Temples
in white Garments; but the Priest's Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are particoloured; both the Work
and Colours are wonderful: they are
made of no rich Materials, for they are
neither embroidered, nor set with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Stones, but are composed of the
Plumes of several Birds, laid together
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53806:100"/>
with so much Art, and so neatly, that the
true value of them is far beyond the cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
Materials. They say, that in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and placing those Plumes, some
dark Mysteries are represented, which
pass down among their Priests in a secret
Tradition concerning them; and that they
are as Hieroglyphicks, putting them in
mind of the Blessings that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from God, and of their Duties,
both to him and to their Neighbours. As
soon as the Priest appears in those Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they all fall prostrate on the
Ground, with so much reverence and so
deep a silence, that such as look on, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be struck with it, as if it were
the effect of the appearance of a Deity.
After they have been for some time in
this posture, they all stand up, upon a
sign given by the Priest, and sing some
Hymns to the Honour of God, some mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Instruments playing all the while.
These are quite of another form than
those that are used among us: but, as
many of them are much sweeter than ours,
so others are not to be compared to those
that we have. Yet in one thing they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
us much, which is, that all their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
both Vocal and Instrumental, does
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53806:101"/>
so imitate and express the Passions, and is so
fitted to the present occasion, whether the
subject matter of the Hymn is chearful,
or made to appease, or troubled, doleful,
or angry; that the Musick makes an
impression of that which is represented,
by which it enters deep into the Hearers,
and does very much affect and kindle
them. When this is done, both Priests
and People offer up very solemn Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God in a set Form of Words; and
these are so composed, that whatsoever
is pronounced by the whole Assembly,
may be likewise applied by every Man
in particular to his own condition; in
these they acknowledg God to be the
Author and Governor of the World,
and the Fountain of all the Good that
they receive; for which they offer up
their Thanksgivings to him; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
they bless him for his Goodness
in ordering it so, that they are born
under a Government that is the happiest
in the World, and are of a Religion
that they hope is the truest of all others:
but if they are mistaken, and if there is
either a better Government, or a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
more acceptable to God, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
his Goodness to let them know it,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53806:101"/>
vowing, that they resolve to follow him
whithersoever he leads them: but if their
Government is the best, and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
the truest, then they pray that he
may fortify them in it, and bring all the
World, both to the same Rules of Life,
and to the same Opinions concerning
himself; unless, according to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchableness
of his Mind, he is pleased
with a variety of Religions. Then they
pray that God may give them an easy
passage at last to himself; not presuming
to set limits to him, how early or late it
should be; but if it may be wish'd for,
without derogating from his Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
they desire rather to be quickly
delivered, and to go to God, tho by the
terriblest sort of Death, than to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
long from seeing him, in the most
prosperous course of Life possible. When
this Prayer is ended, they all fall down
again upon the Ground, and after a little
while they rise up, and go home to
Dinner; and spend the rest of the day
in diversion or Military Exercises.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I described to you, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
as I could, the Constitution of
that Common-Wealth, which I do not
only think to be the best in the World,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53806:102"/>
but to be indeed the only <hi>Common-Wealth</hi>
that truly deserves that name. In all
other places, it is visible, that whereas
People talk of a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> every
Man only seeks his own <hi>Wealth;</hi> but there
where no Man has any Property, all Men
do zealously pursue the good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:
and indeed, it is no wonder to see
Men act so differently, for in other
Common-Wealths, every Man knows,
that unless he provides for himself, how
flourishing soever the Common-Wealth
may be, he must die of Hunger; so that
he sees the necessity of preferring his own
Concerns to the Publick; but in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi>
where every Man has a right to every thing,
they do all know, that if care is taken to
keep the Publick Stores full, no private
Man can want any thing; for among
them there is no unequal distribution, so
that no Man is poor, nor in any necessity;
and tho no Man has any thing, yet they
are all rich; for what can make a Man so
rich, as to lead a serene and chearful Life,
free from anxieties; neither apprehending
want himself, nor vexed with the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
complaints of his Wife? he is not
affraid of the misery of his Children, nor
is he contriving how to raise a Portion for
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53806:102"/>
his Daughters, but is secure in this, that
both he and his Wife, his Children and
Grand-Children, to as many Generations
as he can fancy, will all live, both plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
and happily, since among them
there is no less care taken of those who
were once engaged in Labour, but grow
afterwards unable to follow it, than there
is elsewhere for these that continue still at
it. I would gladly hear any Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the Justice that is among them, with
that which is among all other Nations;
among whom, may I perish, if I see any
thing that looks either like Justice, or
Equity; for what Justice is there in this,
that a Noble-man, a Goldsmith, or a
Banquer, or any other Man, that either
does nothing at all, or at best is imployed
in things that are of no use to the Publick,
should live in great luxury and splendor,
upon that which is so ill acquired; and a
mean Man, a Carter, a Smith, or a Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that works harder, even than the
Beasts themselves, and is imployed in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
that are so necessary, that no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth
could hold out an Year to
an end without them, can yet be able to
earn so poor a livelihood out of it, and
must lead so miserable a Life in it, that
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                        <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:53806:103"/>
whole People, then they are accounted
Laws: and yet these wicked Men after
they have, by a most insatiable covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
divided that among themselves, with
which all the rest might have been well
supplied, are far from that happiness,
that is enjoyed among the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians:</hi> for
the use as well as the desire of Mony
being extinguished, there is much anxiety
and great occasions of Mischief cut off
with it: and who does not see that Frauds,
Thefts, Robberies, Quarrels, Tumults,
Contentions, Seditions, Murders, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries,
and Witchrafts, that are indeed
rather punished than restrained by the
severities of Law, would all fall off, if
Mony were not any more valued by
the World? Mens Fears, Solicitudes,
Cares, Labours, and Watchings, would
all perish in the same moment, that the
value of Mony did sink: even Poverty
it self, for the relief of which Mony
seems most necessary, would fall, if there
were no Mony in the World. And in
order to the apprehending this aright, take
one instance.</p>
                  <p>Consider any Year that has been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful,
that many thousands have died of
Hunger; and yet if at the end of that Year a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53806:103"/>
survey were made of the Granaries of all the
rich Men, that have hoarded up the Corn,
it would be found that there was enough
among them, to have prevented all that
consumption of Men that perished in that
Misery: and that if it had been distributed
among them, none would have felt the
terrible effects of that scarcity; so easy a
thing would it be to supply all the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of Life, if that blessed thing called
<hi>Mony,</hi> that is pretended to be invented
for procuring it, were not really the only
thing that obstructed it.</p>
                  <p>I do not doubt but rich Men are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of this, and that they know well
how much a greater happiness it were to
want nothing that were necessary, than to
abound in many superfluities; and to be
rescued out of so much Misery, than to
abound with so much Wealth: and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think but the sense of every Man's
Interest, and the Authority of Chirst's
Commands, who as he was infinitely wise,
and so knew what was best, so was no
less good in discovering it to us, would
have drawn all the World over to the
Laws of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topians,</hi> if <hi>Pride,</hi> that
plague of Humane Nature, that is the
source of so much misery, did not hinder

                     </gap>

count the had given of it in general; and
so taking him by the hand, I carried him to
supper, and told him I would find out some
other time for examining that matter more
particularly, and for discoursing more
copiously concerning it; for which I wish
I may find a good opportunity. In the
mean while, tho I cannot perfectly agree
to every thing that was related by <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael,</hi>
yet there are many things in the
Common-Wealth of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> that I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wish than hope to see followed in
our Governments; tho it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
that he is both a very learned Man,
and has had a great practice in the
World.</p>
