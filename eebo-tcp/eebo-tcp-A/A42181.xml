            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>ALL improvements in arts have ever been alike ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, to the fate of either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlighted by the injudicious, or frown'd upon by the cenſorious; till being crown'd with ſucceſs, their manifest advantages have forced mankind to a liking of, and compliance with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>And though Phyſick is more than the reſt capable of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as its daily advance doth ſufficiently manifest: yet being
<pb facs="tcp:49399:3"/>
likewiſe daily ſullied by the vain pretences of the ignorant, 'tis no wonder, if even the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous themſelves look ſomewhat ſtrangely upon what is beyond the common method of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
            <p>But every thing that ſeems new ought not therefore to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; ſince, if it be verified by experience, it bears date with time and truth it ſelf: the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of art and nature not being of ſo narrow a compaſs as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent knowledge. And though it be far from me to imagine my skill and judgment to be above that of other Phyſitians, however my univerſity, and collegiate qualifications, will (I hope) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently exempt me, from being
<pb facs="tcp:49399:3"/>
accounted only a pretender to what I profeſs.</p>
            <p>Yet having (beſides the other parts of Phyſick) chiefly employed my time and ſtudies, in order to the cure of the Stone; wherein what ſucceſs I have had, both by inward remedies and manual o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, this famous city can ſufficiently evidence; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gout to be equally tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, if not as pernicious a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and altogether of the ſame origine, 'tis no wonder if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximity of the ſubject bent my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that way.</p>
            <p>Now having by the bleſſing of GOD attained, to a ſeldom fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing method for the cure of, and preſervation from that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe: I ſubmit my endeavours

               <hi>Arthritology:</hi> OR, A DISCOURSE OF THE GOUT.</head>
            <p>THE body of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it blood, phlegm, and a two-fold bile, to wit, yellow and black, of which the nature of this body is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, upon account where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alſo it is ſick, and enjoys health, <hi>Hipp. de Naturâ Hominis,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49399:5"/>
               <hi>Text</hi> xix, <hi>&amp; ſequ.</hi> Yet not theſe humours alone do affect the body, but the qualities of the humours are in a poſſibility to affect it; ſuch as, a bitter, a ſalt, an acid, and other things both within a man, and out of a man; and theſe qualities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed through a mixtion, and mutual temperament among themſelves, are neither diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor create any man trouble: but when any one of theſe is divided or ſeparated from the reſt, and exiſts by itſelf, then it is clear and plainly evident, how great trouble and pain it creates a man.</p>
            <p>The ſalt in our body, the ſalt, I ſay, and acrid, which was diuted with a thin inſipid,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49399:5"/>
or water, as ſoon as ever it is ſeparated, and falls upon the ſenſible parts about the joynts, there it preſently excites pain, firſt of all by twitching and pricking them, and not long after by preſſing and diſtending them with its abundance. As this ſalt likewiſe is more or leſs ſharp or vehement, the pains alſo do much vary, that is, do increaſe or abate. And this ſalt is lodged in the <hi>ſerum,</hi> which that it is acid, or that an acid adheres to it, cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>There is moreover in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> of our body a certain thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker matter, which we may call the terrene faeculency, of which nodes are chiefly generated.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49399:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This one thing alſo we do over and above maintain, that there is ſomething of a thicker ſalt in the <hi>ſerum</hi> itſelf, which joyned by ſome of the terrene blood out of the reſt of the maſs, will much alter the nature of the Gout, in reſpect of pain, heat, and duration, as to degree, or violence, or gentleneſs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this ſalt <hi>ſerum</hi> is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the extremities of the muſcles, tendons, ligaments, <hi>perioſtea,</hi> and the other nervous parts of the joynts, in which places alſo nodes and ſtones are uſually bred.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as long as the uſe of things non natural is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, all goes well; but when the body is pampered with more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49399:6"/>
plenty than is needful, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the blood are not ſo exactly mixt with the reſt of the maſs, but are blended and confounded as heterogeneous; whereupon, ſanguification once vitiated, the blood is uſually cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by divers humours, and the non-natural heat grows ſo high, that it is forced to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a fermentation, like new beer, and it works ſo much more than uſual, that it ſeems to boyl: then it forces thoſe ſharp and foreign juyces, together with part of the <hi>ſerum,</hi> by what way it finds; what gets into the guts is eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated by a watery looſeneſs; what into the kidneys, by plenty of urine; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the habit of the body, by the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49399:7"/>
pores of the skin: but what falls upon the joynts, pierceth into the inmoſt receſſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſtices of the nervous parts, which being beſet round with denſe and cold parts, uſe to ſtop and retain the <hi>ſerum.</hi> This <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> at firſt is very ſmall, but thin and ſharp, producing pain only deep within, and a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling without; yet the violence of the pain continuing, greater ſtore of <hi>ſerum,</hi> and very often a flood of other humours with it, ſupervenes, ſo that at laſt the ſwelling appears, which in a plethorick body by its redneſs, heat, and throbbing pain reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles an angry boyl: and when this humor is ſpent, that fit of the Gout is at an end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49399:7"/>
And the nature of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is ſuch, that when it has once ſeized a man (unleſs by the care and induſtry of Phyſicians prevented, eſpecially by ſuch as are well experienced in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair) ſcarce any one can look ſo well to himſelf, but that at certain ſeaſons and diſtances of time it will return, when the matter is increaſed afreſh, and gathered to the joynts again; which diſtances in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are longer, and when the maſs of blood is vitiated, and the joynts weakned, become ſhorter, ſo that they confine ſome people perpetually to their bed, and render the joynts ſtiff and knotty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49399:8"/>
It remains now to enquire, what the cauſes of the ſerous matter in the blood are, and then what moves it firſt, and cauſes the fit; the firſt our Schools call <hi>Antecedent,</hi> the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Procatarctick cauſes. Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> in his Book <hi>de priſca Medicina</hi> teacheth, how that Salts, Acids, Sweets, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of other ſuch things, which are in us, have divers faculties according to their plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power; but do no way moleſt us, when they are mixt and mutually tempered one with another.</p>
            <p>This mixture and temper is often diſſolved in the maſs of blood, when the humors are augmented in plenty or power,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49399:8"/>
or in both. Omitting other humors, in the foregoing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, we have only mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>ſerum,</hi> to which in the further diſquiſition hereof we will confine our ſelves, and do ſay, that ſometimes the evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this <hi>ſerum</hi> is hindred, and ſometimes too great plenty of <hi>ſerum</hi> is bred. The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary evacuation of the <hi>ſerum</hi> is hindred, when ſome vitious matter is impacted in the very glands, whence it comes to paſs, that either the ſenſible or inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible tranſpiration of our body is inſufficient, as it happens in idleneſs, melancholy, ſtopping of ſweat, and over-cooling the body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49399:9"/>
Moreover the neceſſary eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution of this <hi>ſerum</hi> is hindred, when people are coſtive, and make but a little urine and thin, ſuch as contains not in itſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of ſalt and ſediment.</p>
            <p>For the alimentary and ſweet portion of what we eat and drink, cannot be wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the ſubſtance of our body, but even this has ſome excrements: So that the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and violent juice,</hi> which is the other part of our aliment, (according to <hi>Hippocrates)</hi> ought not to be wholly mixt with the blood, but the greateſt ſhare of it ſhould be purged out by ſtool and urine (whence it may be drawn by deſtillation).
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49399:9"/>
Now if for the cauſes aforeſaid the evacuation of the ſharp <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> be checked, as it increaſes firſt in plenty, and then in power, it is ſeparated from the other parts; and ſo it affords matter for the Gout.</p>
            <p>Now we proceed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that is, to the more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful generation of <hi>ſerum;</hi> here we do not mean the ſupply of the watry part, but of the acrid and ſalt, or a certain hereditary inclination to the Gout, (deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the ſeed and maternal blood) which ſeems to conſiſt in a weakneſs of the joynts, and eſpecially in ſome innate fault of the blood. Then there is an adſcititious diſpoſition of the body, induced partly by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49399:10"/>
frequent invaſion of the fit part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the manner of living, ſuch as is in them, who though they uſe their utmoſt diligence, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not guard themſelves from the return of this grief.</p>
            <p>Which indeed happens for divers cauſes, hereafter to be mentioned, namely, through the weakneſs of the parts about the joynts; through pains, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many fibres of the nervous parts are broke; from a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent influx of humors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the parts are relaxed and ſoftned; through unreaſonable heat or cold; from violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it happens in Venery; and finally, when a vitious ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guification is contracted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the acrid matter is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49399:10"/>
bred in the blood.</p>
            <p>Such meats and drink ſhould be taken notice of, as have in them a ſharp matter in ſuch plenty and power, as not being to be conquered with the other juices in our body, it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſufficiently ſeparated nor diſcharged, nor can it be exactly mixt or tempered with the other juyces.</p>
            <p>Such as are generous Wines, which have much Tartar in them; for not only that Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, but the ſpirit alſo breeds the Gout, which conſiſts of an oyl, an acid and a volatil ſalt, from whence the Wine receives all its ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Moreover, gluttony and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs contribute much to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49399:11"/>
breeding of this humor; all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance likewiſe in dainty meat and drink, over hard ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, eſpecially in the night, which in this caſe is the moſt dangerous; and afflicting cares; all theſe hinder ſanguification, ſo that the ſharp part in the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is either not well mixt, or not well ſeparated; and above all immoderate <hi>Venus</hi> is the moſt dangerous and hurtful.</p>
            <p>But if any doubt ariſe, and the queſtion be, what way it hurts, it may properly be repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his aſſertion is of undoubted truth; <hi>there is in us a ſalt and a ſharp:</hi> Now I think this is rendred more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious by the uſe of Venery, ſo that at firſt it is augmented

not ſo much in plenty as in power; for what is ſweet or fat in the blood, is conſumed partly with the ſpirits, partly with the ſeed, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains is more and more exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and ſo exiſting more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, it acquires ſtrength and does harm.</p>
            <p>This matter being augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gathered by the foreſaid cauſes, is moved, not always by the proper impulſe of nature, but often as it is ſtimulated by ſeveral evident cauſes; ſuch as are able either to impreſs an impulſe on the blood, or to quicken its internal motion or fermentation, violent paſſions of the mind, eſpecially anger and fear, ſudden cold and heat,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49399:12"/>
retention of accuſtomed ſweat, ſome ſeaſons of the year, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Spring and Autumn, and as we ſaid before, gluttony and Venery.</p>
            <p>The cauſes of this diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now explained, we lay down this definition of the Gout:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Gout is a violent pain of the parts about the joynts, cauſed by a ſerous and ſharp humor, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly coming out of the Veſſels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes wandring pains foretell the Gout to be coming, eſpecially in the joynts of the feet or hands: that it is at hand, ſtretching, yawning, painful wearineſs, catarrhs, wandring
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49399:12"/>
pains in the limbs and joynts, and ſometimes a heavineſs in the head do ſhew: a kind of feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh heat, a pricking pain in the joynt, with inability to move, and after that a ſwelling uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly red, which are attended by divers other things, as watching, loſs of ſtrength, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complaints familiar to gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perſons, ſhew it to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>The Gout ends either in the tranſlation of the matter to a more ignoble part, or in the diſcuſſion of it, or when, being changed into corruption, it breaks through the skin, or when, tarrying long there, it turns knotty: All which come to paſs, ſometimes by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49399:13"/>
of nature, ſometimes of art.</p>
            <p>For there is a twofold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in the artificial cure; Firſt, to remove that which aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the paroxyſm; Secondly, to preſerve the patient from the return of it. In the fit three things are urgent, pain, the ſwelling and inability to move; of all which ſince an humor is the cauſe, partly ſtill coming in, partly got in already; ſo the whole method of cure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in two things; firſt in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the influx of the humor; ſecondly in expelling the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor that is got in.</p>
            <p>Which method of cure is often interrupted by ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous pain or by ſome other ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſymptome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49399:13"/>
The influx may be checked by repelling the humor from the joynt, or by ſtopping its motion, or by expelling it out of the Body.</p>
            <p>Repulſion, whereby the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is driven from the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, may be made either by ſtrong ligatures, or by applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of coolers and aſtringents.</p>
            <p>The Repulſion of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in the beginning is very dangerous, becauſe the repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed humor may run either into another joynt, or into ſome more noble part, or being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted into the inner receſſes of the parts about the joynt, it may increaſe the pain.</p>
            <p>The motion of the humor, which depends upon a certain
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49399:14"/>
inevitable agitation of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogenous humors, cannot of itſelf be ſtopt; yet it may be abated by evacuating ſome part of the maſs of blood (if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinder) by venaeſection; whereupon the quantity of the humors being leſſened, the heat of the blood, and the violence of the peccant matter, may both be ſtopt in ſome meaſure.</p>
            <p>The evacuation of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which does offend, (if this humor could altogether be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated,) would prove a moſt effectual remedy againſt its run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the joynts.</p>
            <p>Now this evacuation is made by vomits and ſweats. Vomits and purges may either follow blood-letting, or they may
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49399:14"/>
ſerve inſtead of it, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny previous preparatives or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations. Diureticks and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorificks do very often give much relief; the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing in a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides are ſo able to extirpate the very root of the diſeaſe, that is, the ſalt and tartar: for we have known ſeveral, who have been recovered by virtue of theſe, taken either ſeparately or together: ſuch as are anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial medicines, <hi>antimonium diaphoreticum,</hi> Cinnabar of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Volatil Salts, as volatil Salt of harts-horn, greater burdock-root, a deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of germander, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things called antipoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49399:15"/>
To remove the humor, when it is fallen upon the joynt, there is a neceſſity for diſcuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, wherewith ſometimes ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a repellent is to be mixt. Fat and oily things are carefully to be avoided, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the pores are ſhut up. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies compoſed of ſalts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fixt or volatil, are the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of all; the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they vehemently diſcuſs the impacted humors, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate the weakned parts. There are ſome alſo, who uſe to apply ſpirit of ſalt, mixt or allay'd with ſome other Liquor.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we muſt attend with our utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and caution, to things which either relieve or do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49399:15"/>
becauſe the ſalt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors may be various, and may be mixt with various ichors. If the matter, when the thinner parts are diſcuſſed, do congele, and degenerate into chalky knots, ſtronger emollients, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with diſcutients, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; ſuch as gum Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, and ſeveral ſorts of gums, to which if the node gives not way, the skin muſt be broke, and the chalky ſtones taken out.</p>
            <p>As to the diet, in the fit it muſt be altogether ſpare and thin, ſmall wine may be drunk moderately, ſharp and ſalt food muſt wholly be avoided, the cold air is to be kept off, and ſweating muſt be indulged.</p>
