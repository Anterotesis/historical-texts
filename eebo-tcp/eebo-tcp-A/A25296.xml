            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Friends, the Lord hath put it into my heart to write unto
you concerning those things which are most needful to
be witnessed by you, and brought forth in you, and amongst
you.</head>
            <p>MY Brethren, Sisters and Friends, the Almighty
God hath visited you in his everlasting love,
and in a time in which you were without
the true peace did the Lord reach unto you,
and called you into the way where peace is found;
Then did the Lord touch your hearts, and begot in
you a Hunger, Thirst and breathing after himself, and
he opened the way unto you, which before you knew
not, wherein you might find rest and be satisfied; and
the Almighty hath shined amongst you, and the
brightness of his rising did break forth in you, by
which your hearts were enlightned that you have
seen and comprehended all the worlds waies, in
which you also did walk; And the Lord hath watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over you for good, even unto this day he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
you in many difficulties and dangers which
appeared against you, he rebuked the proud for your
sakes, and the Mighty who contemned you brought he
into cotempt, he preserved you in the midest of the
fiery rage of men, and hath not suffered the flame to
hurt you, Salvation hath been your defence round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and life did spring up within you, the vertue of
the Almighty attended you, that you might feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, that the Immortal vertue might be your daily
bread, the power of his Arm reached unto you to
bear you in the way that you should walk, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99436:3"/>
your hearts might be purged from all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that you might have fellowship with your
God.</p>
            <p>The glory of his power broke forth in you, which
gave you courage and dominion, the eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
was opened unto you to draw your affections
thither, that your portion might be with your God,
and that he might be your lot for ever, that your
minds might be redeemed from the Earth, and your
affections from things that perish, that you might
know your life to be in God, and your strength to be
the power of his Arm, that the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
might be your delight, and the brightness of his
glory your joy, that his Righteousness might be your
covering, and his wisdome a fountain within you,
that in his counsel you might dwell to praise his name
for ever.</p>
            <p>You dear Children whose rejoycing is in the Lord,
who dwell in his power and his eternal Counsel and
wisdome, your dwelling is glorious, you seek not the
favour of men, neither do you seek to be esteemed by
men above others, but your peace is to know that
you are esteemed by the Lord; you are poor, but the
Lord is to you riches, you are weak, but the Lord is
strength unto you, your delight is not to flourish in
knowledge, therein to appear before men, to gain a
great name, and to be looked upon to be the greatest,
but your delight is to know the Tree of life flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in you, and you love not your lives unto death for
the love of God who hath called you, and you are
content to be esteemed fools, and do not seek by the
wisdome of words in the exalted knowledge, or any
disobedience to fly the reproach of men.</p>
            <p>You delight in the least appearance of God in any,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99436:3"/>
and you dispise it not, because they in whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
are not so wise as you, you look not upon the
poor with disdain, but the love of God flows from
you to the needy, you delight to deal your bread to
the hungry that they also might be partakers of your
refreshments, and the poor in spirit you cherish with
delight, because you judge not with respect of
persons, for the spirit of true Judgment is within
you.</p>
            <p>You are not offended when another is esteemed
above you, neither for that cause (nor any other)
doth evil lodge in your hearts; you strive not to rule
over others, but you rejoyce to be ruled by the Lord,
whose power is in your inward parts, and the glory
of his rising is the light in which you walk, your day
shall never be darkned, neither shall the night over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
you who keep the word of life, the proud shall
not prosper in their way, neither shall the mighty
prevail against you, your way hath the Almighty
Established, and his eternal and out-stretched Arm
shall guide you therein, and therewith will he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
your enemies whensoever they shall rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you, that his Name might be glorious amongst
the Heathen, and that his renown might spread to
the ends of the Earth, and that you might dwell
with him for ever in the Kingdome prepared for
you.</p>
            <p>Therefore you that have a quick and a large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
take heed that when your understandings
are opened and knowledge increaseth, that that part
which delighteth in knowledge without the power
of God get not up to live in exaltation there, for
in that state you deceive your own Souls which
should be nourished by the Power and Presence of
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:99436:4"/>
And although you shine in appearance as Stars of
Heaven in that state, yet (you being without the
power of God by which you should be kept) there
hath the Dragon power over you, and he will bring
you down to the Earth in the day of tryal; for many
aspire thither, and though they have a zeal for God,
yet they themselves being exalted in knowledge
above the power and wisdome of God, they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the true feeling fellowship or discerning; And
thus many times they disdain the appearance of God
in others, who are meek and poor, and appear not in
that excellency of wisdome and knowledge (in the
thoughts of the conceited wise) as they do, and to
such spirits the Declaration of truth by our dear
Brethren declared (though in the power and wisdom
of God) becomes as an old thing, if it appear not in
that excellency of the wisdome of words, which may
suite with their spirits, and so that by which the poor
and the meek who truly fear God are refreshed, is to
them a loathing, because of their fulness, of which
they ought to be empty, and by such spirits my dear
Brethren do often suffer by back-bitings and secret
reproaches, besides the burden of that Spirit it
self.</p>
            <p>And although such in the general may have in
their understanding how God ought to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and what is his way and in that knowledge be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted,
yet the secrets of the Lord they know not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is his Counsel the place of their dwellings; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they may have a zeal for the Lord and his
way, yet they themselves are out of it, and being
without the power of God, they cannot overcome
their lusts, and this is the cause that many times
through the evil practises of some, the way of truth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99436:4"/>
is evil spoken of, and although they have a form of
Godliness, yet are their hearts unsanctified; therefore
watch all that you be not overcome.</p>
            <p>I say unto you all watch that you may not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and when you feel any thing rising in you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
another, because (as you think) he doth not
respect you as he ought to do, take heed that that
prevail not over you, for if it do, then from thence as
a stream will evil thoughts, prejudice, and had surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
against others flow forth, untill you are consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in it; Therefore be sure to watch against that
part in you, which would rise up in prejudice and
evil thoughts, that the simplicity of the Gospel might
abound in you, in that, in meekness and long suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bear, that they who walk otherwise might be
ashamed.</p>
            <p>For many there are who surmise evil, and conceive
prejudice in their hearts against others without a
cause, and this is a cursed thing; therefore every one
watch that your hearts may be kept from being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with it.</p>
            <p>And you that have attained to a measure of stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
let the wisdome of the Almighty be your guide,
that you might cherish the fainting and help the
needy, encourage the tender and them that are weak,
let your tenderness in staidness, wisdome and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
appear unto them, for a friendly behaviour cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the simple, comforteh the weak and encourageth
them who are of a fainting heart, when a strange, and
stern carriage may discourage, oppress, and in some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
prejudice.</p>
            <p>But have not familiarity without the wisdome of
God, as many have to the giving liberty to vanity, or
to the letting up of a light spirit in any, or to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99436:5"/>
in of an unclean spirit over you, either so to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
your burden, or otherwise to captivate your
hearts into evil, as it hath been with many, who for
want of the watch to the light to be guided by the
true wisdome, have been familier with unclean spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and have been defiled with them; but be ye pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
of Righteousness, Holiness and Purity by your
wise walking in the fear of God in all your conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And walk in love towards all men, in wisdom and
fear, and towards them who have received the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of truth, let the manifestation of your love be
such, that nothing in them thereby may be raised up
to expect that from you, which you intend not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, which they ought not to except from you;
for thus many have been snared and have fallen, that
when love in familiarity hath been manifested to
them, the contrary part in them, thereby hath taken
occasion to look out after, and to except that which
was not intended towards them; So the wrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and expectations being raised, becomes a snare to
the Soul; Therefore in the true fear, wisdome and
discerning, let your love be manifested, that all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of evil may be avoided.</p>
            <p>And when any of you feel any thing rising in you,
that is discontented at any time, because another
(as you may think) is esteemed above you; watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that, for that is <hi>Cains</hi> nature by which the
world is guided, who seek every one to be greatest,
and if that get Dominion in your hearts, then envy
and emulation which proceedeth thereout, will lodg
within you, and that will break your unity with
God and his people, and cause swift destruction to
come upon you; Therefore watch that through the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99436:5"/>
power of Gods Spirit working in you, that nature
may be utterly destroyed and rooted out, that you
may be content to be esteemed the least, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
man esteemed you to be, (whatever man he may
be) your peace may abide in this, that you know that
you are esteemed by the Lord.</p>
            <p>And when any of you feel any thing that desireth
fleshly liberty, keep that down, and let the fear of God
possesse your hearts, for if that be given way unto in
one thing, it thereby recovereth strength to prevail
over you, to lead you to another, and this it will do
untill it hath estranged you from Gods Spirit, and
have made you to be as other men, Children of wrath
and condemnation; Therefore in the light watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, and give no liberty to the lust of the flesh,
but let that be (through Gods spirit) crucified in you
that your liberty may stand in the eternal Kingdom of
God.</p>
            <p>And if there be any thing in you that longeth for
revenge, or the destruction of them that have harmed
you, that proceeds from the evil root, and you are
not to be of that Spirit, and if that prevail over you,
it will destroy your peace with God, and break your
unity with his people; And although you may deny
to act outwardly against your enemies, yet if such a
Spirit hath place in you which do desire the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their persons, that will become a snare unto
your souls, except in the Light and power of God you
wait, that thereby it might be overcome, that you
may truly know what it is (and also do it) to love
your enemies, to blesse them that curse you, and to
pray for them that dispitefully use you; And in so
doing you will heap coals of fire upon their heads,
and approve your selves the Children of God, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99436:6"/>
abide in peace with him, and in the time of tryal you
wil possess your souls in patience; but if the other spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hath dominion over you, when your enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
you will fret your selves and be impatient, in
desiring their destruction, you will destroy your own
peace, and the Lord will not regard you.</p>
            <p>And all friends take heed that you are not filled
with the cares of this life, to gather together worldly
goods to provide for the time to come, least your
hearts are taken up with it, and you be overcome
with Covetousness, and so forget the living God, that
Created Heaven and Earth, and the treasure of this
World become your God; but wait in the light that
your hearts may be kept out of evil to worship God
in Spirit, casting all your care upon him, having found
his Kingdom and Righteousness; Yet to be diligent
every one in his place and calling in the true fear of
God, that you may be a holy people peculiar unto
God, and ordering the Creation in his fear and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to his glory every one in his place; But make
not the corruptable things your Treasure.</p>
            <p>And you that are Parents of Children, let not your
minds run into the Earth, there to strive to heap up,
that you may get portions for your Children, but let
the fear of God possesse your hearts, and then with
content you will indeed know, that God careth for
all his Children, who trust in him, and not in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
riches, and stand single in the Counsel of God,
that you may know his will, him in all things to obey,
casting your whole care upon him, that you fall not
into the snare of he Devil; for he that striveth
to heap up the Treasure of this life, runneth into a
snare and will fall into a pit; Therefore wait that in
all things whatever it be, you may be governed by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99436:6"/>
the Spirit, and in the wisdome and Counsel of God,
that your peace may flow as a River.</p>
            <p>And you that feel that assaults of the enemie, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to prevail over you, take heed and in the Light
watch, that that nature get not up to prevail over
you, which will dispair of the victory, for if it do, that
will cause you to yield unto him; But in the fear of
God dwell low in patience, believing in the light that
God will preserve you, and there he will give you
power against that dispairing nature and all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of death; And this faith is only in the light, in
which in patience wait (through true obedience) for
the power of God to give you the victory.</p>
            <p>And you that see the Crosse and are affraid of it,
whilest you are looking out, your Condition is mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and fear will be the snare of your souls because
you have regard in your hearts unto that which you
must loose; Therefore turn your eys to the lord, that
in the leadings of his Light you may freely give up
that which is to be crucified, and then your fears will
cease, and your strength in God will abound.</p>
            <p>And take heed you that are wise, that high
thoughts of yourselves prevail not over you, for that
ought not to be, for that will lead you into self-exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
to think your selves to be wise when indeed
you are without the true wisdome, and then there
will be more hope of a fool then of you, if that should
prevail over you; Therefore let the fear of God pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
your hearts, that self may be kept in no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the Lord may be exalted in you, that so you
may dwell in peace; for a servant of the Lord must
not exalt himself, but keep low, that the true God
may be exalted, for whatever he hath which is good
it comes from the Lord; Therefore not unto us, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99436:7"/>
unto his Name be the praise for ever.</p>
            <p>And you who are called to suffer for the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Jesus, let your dwelling be in the Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Counsel of God, that your desires prevail
not over you, and cause you to bow for your liberty,
or at least take away your peace in your bonds; for
when you are bound, if you desire liberty, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desires
working in you make your bonds grievous,
for where desires have liberty, and are not satisfied,
that is a state of grievous bondage; But if you are
bound and desire not your liberty, but are given up
in the will of God, your bonds are not grievous, but
you are in the glorious freedom of the Lord; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
watch against your desires, and in stead of desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
liberty, by the Spirit of God wait in the Crosse,
that those desires which would captivate might be
destroyed, then shall your liberty be glorious, though
you are outwardly in bonds, then you will not be
hasty for your deliverance, but will be willing to
wait the Lords time, in patience and with rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>
            <p>And my dear Friends, let your bodies and all that
you have be given up a Sacrifice unto God, that in
the time of tryal you may approve your selves to be
the peculiar people of God, being willing to deny
your selves, and all outward injoyments for the name
of God, and such a people God will Crown with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life; Therefore my dear Friends, let none have
occasion to say, that for the love of your goods, your
liberty or your lives, any of you have forsaken the
way of truth, which the Lord hath called you to, for
it is through sufferings that the God of Heaven this
day will glorifie his people; Therefore fear not the
rage of man, neither be ye dismayed because of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99436:7"/>
Mighty flood, for the Lord God who loveth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with an everlasting love, hath set the bounds
thereof, and for tryal it is (that they that are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
may appear) and not for the destruction of his
people; Therefore fear not, but be valiant for the
truth of our God.</p>
            <p>And take heed that when at any time you have
outwardly suffered loss for truths sake, that not any
of your minds be drawn out to expect an outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
but rather to rejoyce that you are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
worthy to suffer for the Lords sake, then you shall
have your reward, which is eternal life; for many
when they suffer murmur at their outward losses,
and have an eye out after an outward recompence,
which if they obtain according to their desire, verily
they have their reward, but if they obtain not, they
are offended, and stumble and reproach them from
whom the did expect it, and so they become a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to the Lords people, and a dishonour to truth;
But learn every one in all Conditions without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
to be content, and whatsoever you do, or
whatever you suffer let if it be singly unto he Lord.</p>
            <p>And you that have this worlds goods, set not your
hearts upon it, to bind up the bowels of your love,
from them who are in want, for if you do your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
will be the snare of your souls, and the Lord
will not hold you guiltless.</p>
            <p>And you that are outwardly poor, let not your
minds run out after relief from others to depend
there upon, and so neglect your own diligence, as
many have done, for that mind prevailing in you, if it
be not satisfied it will break forth into emnity, but
let the fear of God possess your hearts, that you may
keep the truth in humility, meekness and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99436:8"/>
to walk, and your tryal will not be beyond your
ability, and herein (though to you is distributed of
the temporal things according to your need, yet) you
will not be burdensome to Gods people, for it is the
desiring and the craving spirit after those things
which is a burden to the just.</p>
            <p>And all friends take heed that that spirit prevail
not in any of you which will lead you to watch for
evil with an evil eye, and although the good appears
it regardeth it not, but watches for the evil, thereby to
take an advantage, this will beget strif and emulation;
But my Friends where any thing of Good appears in
any, although there may be yet much of evil, yet let
your tenderness, patience, meekness and love be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
towards such in the wisdome of God, that the
good which appears may be cherished, that you
might be Instruments of Salvation unto them.</p>
            <p>And whensoever you are called to suffer for the
Lords Testimony, take heed that the hasty fiery spirit
in a fiery zeal be not exalted in you, for that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
but for a season, but keep low to feel and enjoy
the meek quiet suffering and patient spirit of the
Lamb, to bear you through, and therein you will have
peace in your sufferings, and in the end obtain the
victory.</p>
            <p>And the eternal God will establish your goings, and
Crown you with honour, glory and everlasting domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
above all the families of the Earth.</p>
            <closer>I am your Brother in the fellowship of the
Eternal Gospel.
