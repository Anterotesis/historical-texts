         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THough you are more than One Letter in arrears to me already, for which (according to the Rules of Correſpondence) I might well expect your Returns e're I gave you further Credit; yet being providentially furniſh'd with Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Matter, I am eaſily enclin'd to run you one other Letter into my Debt, the Contents of which will be (indeed!)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45205:2"/>
but too Sad and Surprizing.—I am not unſenſible that upon ſuch a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Occaſion I could have addreſt my ſelf to ſeveral, more properly than to your ſelf; bleſſed be God, you are not of that unhappy number, that in <hi>Works,</hi> and even in <hi>Words,</hi> Deny the Divine Being; nor dares you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the leaſt Thought tending to the Contempt of our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>God over All, Bleſſed for ever!</hi> Neither the <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> nor the <hi>more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Socinianiſm</hi> (I was about to call it) of this Profane Age has Tainted your truly Chriſtian Soul: And yet I think the Terrible Inſtance I have before me, of God's Indignation againſt thoſe <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Sins,</hi> will not to <hi>you</hi> be diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly communicated. It may, at leaſt, tend to Eſtabliſh you in your moſt Holy Religion; and thus no doubt but it will be diſpers'd by you, much more than by one leſs ſeriouſly diſpos'd. And truly, I think ſuch a ſingular Relation cannot be made too Publick in our Age, wherein all manner of Licentiouſneſs does abound! But before I acquaint you with Particulars, give me leave to tell you, That you may relate what you ſhall have from me with all the Aſſurance in the World. My Evidence is a very Honeſt Credible Perſon, who <hi>ſaw</hi> and <hi>heard</hi> moſt of what follows, and who had the reſt from <hi>Eye and Ear-Witneſſes.</hi> But I have no Reaſon to imagin that the Truth of this <hi>Divine Tragedy</hi> will be call'd into any Queſtion; it is known over a great part of the County, and was not ſo long ſince acted, but that upon Enquiry, full Satisfaction may be had about it from Perſons of the beſt Credit. And now, without more Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, I ſhall give you a Faithful Account of Matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Downam,</hi> near <hi>Clithero,</hi> in <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> there liv'd one <hi>T. B.</hi> (the full of his Name, for his ſurviving Relations ſake, is conceal'd,) about Thirty ſix Years of Age, well known in that Town, at his Death eſpecially by the Office he then bore of <hi>Churchwarden.</hi> This Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Creature, notwithſtanding the good Education which his better Parents had beſtow'd upon him, had for a great while indulg'd himſelf in an Exceſs of Wickedneſs, but chiefly in a Sacrilegious Abuſe of the <hi>Lord<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s-Day,</hi> on which he would uſe any unlawful Exerciſes: Nor did his Office reſtrain him from committing this Abomination, but as if he (who ſhould have been Firſt in Puniſhing) Prided himſelf in being the Ring-leader of the <hi>Sabbath-Breakers,</hi> he would not only Privately, and at Home, but in the very open Streets, Revel and Sport on that <hi>Holy Day.</hi> For this, and his other Provocations, it pleaſed God ſo to leave him to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and himſelf, that he became guilty of ſuch <hi>horrid Blaſphemy</hi> as procur'd (it is to be fear'd) his Ruine in <hi>both Worlds.</hi> The Manner of it take thus.—On the 26th. Day of <hi>August,</hi> 1694. being <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> (the Day of his ſinful Exceſſes) he gave his Attendance at Church; and after Service, with the Miniſter that preach'd there that Day, he went to the Ale-houſe, where he ſtay'd not long e're he remov'd to his own Houſe; in which ſeeing a Bible lie on a Table, he takes it up, and turning to the 9th. Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> burſts out into this horrid Expreſſion, <hi>Christ is a Lyar!</hi> Upon this, ſays one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45205:2"/>
that was by, <hi>How dare you ſpeak ſuch Blaſphemous Words?</hi> The Wretch, pointing then to the 16th. and 17th. Verſes of that Chapter, (where our Bleſſed Saviour ſaith, <hi>No Man putteth a piece of New Cloth into an Old Garment, neither do Men put New Wine into Old Bottles,)</hi> cryes out, <hi>Why look here, he proves himſelf a Lyar in theſe two things, beſides many more places in the Bible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Night he was ſtruck with much Sadneſs and Sighing, which grew upon him every Day more than other for that whole Week, in which he kept much upon the Bed, very liſtleſs to ſpeak, or indeed, to take any notice of Worldly Concerns. The <hi>Lord<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s-Day</hi> following he ſeem'd much more <hi>Troubl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in Mind,</hi> and <hi>Terrify'd in Conſcience,</hi> and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd a Neighbour's Company all Night: He <hi>would</hi> have Pray'd, but <hi>could</hi> not: His Siſter, at his Requeſt, read by him, but he appear'd little affected with what he heard. Two Days more he continu'd Toſſing about in the Room, keeping much upon his Bed, and Torturing himſelf. On <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> ſeveral Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Others hearing of his grievous Condition, came into the Chamber to him; when ſuddenly he cryes out, <hi>Turn, Turn, Turn,</hi> (many times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) <hi>Shut the Door, Christ is going to leave me.</hi> With that, ſome ſtep'd to the Door and ſhut it; but he having his Eyes ſtill fix'd upon it, with a very hideous Noiſe, cry'd out, <hi>It was too late, Christ was quite gone and left him, he was Damn'd for ever; He is gone, He is gone; it is too late, it is too late; I am Damn'd for evermore.</hi> This he repeated fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; and all that Day he cried out of the <hi>Torments of Hell,</hi> and that he <hi>ſaw the Flames of Fire there, and that he was hanging over the Flames; and</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Hell is a Hundred thouſand Fathoms deep, and I am ſinking Deeper and Deeper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> He added, <hi>That he ſaw a Numberleſs Number there which he knew not, only One particular Perſon he mention'd,</hi> with whom he had been very Converſant, and from whom he was ſuppoſed to have <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted abundance of Guilt.</hi> His Relations, and the reſt with him, were very much affrighted and troubled at his Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Behaviour, but eſpecially to ſee his <hi>Ghaſtly</hi> and <hi>Terrifying</hi> Looks: They ſpoke together of ſending for the Miniſter, and ſome Godly Perſons to Pray with him: But he taking notice of what they ſaid, told them, <hi>That it was now too late either to Pray for him, or to tell him any thing of Christ; And for You too</hi> (ſays he, turning to one of his neareſt Relations) <hi>unleſs you Repent ſoon.</hi> And further, he told them, <hi>That if there were Hundreds and Thouſands of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to Pray for him, it was all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it was too late.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this time, he would not endure to hear of Prayer, or Reading the Bible, nor would ſo much as ſuffer any to take a Bible in their Hands; nay, ſo great a Torment did the Sight of a Bible, or Hearing of Prayer ſeem to him, that upon either, he'd cry out, <hi>Let me go, Let me go; I will not ſtay here.</hi> And the Miniſter coming to him with a Book in his Hand, he would have ſtruck it out; and toſſing and rouling his Body, he us'd all the means he could to get out of the Room, all along crying out, <hi>Do you not ſee the Fire flaming in Hell, and the Lake of Hell Fire, and the Depth of Hell, which cannot be fathom'd: O Hell-Fire! Hell-fire! Fire of Hell! Fire of Hell! Oh, how I ſiak down in it!</hi> Thus
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45205:3"/>
he continu'd Crying out, to the great Amazement and Terrour of all the Company, all that Day, and part of the Night; and the next Day he was <hi>Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs:</hi> And upon <hi>Friday,</hi> the 7th. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> 1694. he Expir'd, in the Morning.</p>
            <p>☞ <hi>His Body, for ſeveral Hours after his Death, Sweating very apparently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus have I briefly made you this fearful Relation, after which I ſhall but add my hearty Prayers for Our Selves, and for all whoſe Ears are made to Tingle with this dreadful Report, That we may be preſerved continually, by the Grace of God, from Profaning his Holy Day; and above all, from <hi>Villi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> the Glorious Perſon of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> to forewarn Men of the <hi>horrid</hi> Danger whereof this Miſerable Wretch ſeems to be ſet up, by Divine Providence, a Terrible and Speaking Monument!</p>
            <p>But here I ſhall bid you Farewell, and with due Reſpects to your Self, and the good Ladies your Siſters, in great haſte, I ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>
