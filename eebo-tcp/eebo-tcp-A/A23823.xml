            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Containing ſome General Obſervations.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHen I ſee Men arguing againſt the Trinity; methinks I hear a Papiſt inveighing againſt <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> for queſtioning the Truth of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. Indeed it appears to me very ſtrange, that Proteſtants ſhould ſtand to <hi>the Principles of the Reformation,</hi> only when they ſerve their turn; and that they ſhould be ready to part with them, when they are not otherways able to defend a particular Opinion. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, that the Chriſtian Church in ſucceeding Ages fell ſhort of her firſt Purity, in reſpect of Doctrine as well as Manners. Now what other Remedy could be applied to ſuch a Depravation, than a ſincere and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Examination of the Points ſuſpected of Falſhood, according to Reaſon and Scripture? This proved ſo effectual a Courſe; that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, and ſome other Canonized Opinions were found to be meer Human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and accordingly were rejected as contrary to the two above-mentioned Rules. And who can aſſure us, that the Reformation left no Error behind; and that the Trinity is ſuch an Opinion, as ought neither to be doubted of, nor to be reformed? Shall we truſt Men, barely on their Word? Or was it impoſſible that the Trinity ſhould creep into the Church, as well as ſeveral other falſe Opinions? Our Principles therefore allow us to examine it; and to inquire, whether it be founded on undeniable Arguments: eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being of ſuch a nature that it contradicts Reaſon; and by confeſſion of all Trinitarians, is no where ſet down in Holy Scripture <hi>in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Words.</hi> Why ſhould Men call us Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Libertines, becauſe we inquire after Truth; and will have our Faith built upon a ſolid Foundation? Was the Reformation ſo proper to <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin, &amp;c.</hi> that it ought no more to be thought of? Or were thoſe Reformers ſo infallible, that they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Church from all Errors? This I think would be an hard matter to prove. Let therefore no Proteſtant be ſcandalized; if having ſome Scruples about the Trinity, we endeavour to free our ſelves from them, by a ſincere inquiry into the Grounds of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64942:3"/>
I begin with <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and find that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a Trinity does contradict it, as much as Tranſubſtantiation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> According to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, the ſame Numerical Body may be in a Million of different places at the ſame time. According to the Trinity, three Divine Perſons, that is to ſay, three Intelligent Infinite Beings, each of which is God, make but one God. I cannot believe the Firſt; becauſe Reaſon teaches me, that one Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Body can occupy or be in but one place at one time. I cannot believe the other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Reaſon tells me, that Three are Three, and not One: and that it implies no leſs a Contradiction, that Three Divine Perſons ſhould be but One God; than that one Body be a Million. Now who ſhould not ſcruple an Opinion, perfectly parallel with Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation; and equally fruitful in Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities and Contradictions?</p>
               <p>I come in the ſecond place to examine; Whether the Trinity be well grounded <hi>in Scripture?</hi> Indeed <hi>Three</hi> are there mentioned; <hi>the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:</hi> but how came Men to fancy, that they Three are but One God? Who taught 'em ſo? Does the Holy Scripture plainly ſay; that <hi>there is but one God, yet there are Three Perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the Godhead?</hi> One would think indeed, that ſuch a Myſtery, and ſo neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Salvation, were ſet down in Scripture in plain or expreſs Words. But the Scripture is perfectly ſilent about it: there is not a Word to be found in the Bible, of <hi>Three Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſes or Perſons in the Godhead.</hi> The Father is in a thouſand places called <hi>God,</hi> diſtinctly from the Son; nay <hi>the only true God.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt is no where ſtiled <hi>God.</hi> And the Son is ſo called in a few places, as it were by the way, and in ſuch manner as plainly ſhows, that the Title <hi>[God]</hi> is beſtowed on him, upon the ſame account as upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> even becauſe of the Dignity and Power, to which he was exalted by the Father's Liberality. Indeed it can have no other meaning. The Holy Scripture teaches us, that there is but one God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But if ſo; How can the Son be that one God, the Father? Of this we are ſure, by the whole tenor of the Goſpel, that Chriſt was a Man. The Goſpel is nothing elſe but the Hiſtory of Chriſt's Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion into Heaven. Who would have thought, that a Man ſhould be accounted the Supream God, without any ſuch intimation from Scripture, nay againſt the whole current of it? We find in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that there is one God, the Father of our Lord Chriſt; one Son of God, ſent into the World to be the Revealer of his Father's Will, and a Mediator between God and Man, even Chriſt; and one Holy Ghoſt, who diſtributes and works all ſorts of Miraculous Gifts, for the confirmation of the Goſpel. The Father of Chriſt is the One true God; Chriſt is only his Miniſter and Interpreter; the Holy Ghoſt (whether it be God's Power, or his miniſtring Angel, or Angels) the Inſtrument which he makes uſe of to work Miracles. None cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly but Men blinded or prejudiced could think, that God's Miniſter and Ambaſſador were God himſelf; and that two ſo oppoſite Beings as God and Chriſt, ſhould be one and the ſame Thing. It is juſt as if one ſhould ſay, there is one King <hi>William;</hi> and one Vice-Roy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Sidney;</hi> and the Vice-Roy is that one King <hi>William.</hi> Indeed this is a Doctrine ſo unreaſonable and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and ſo oppoſite to Holy Scripture; that I think, had there been no ſuch thing as Platonick Philoſophy, the Trinity ſhould never have been heard of. I deſire therefore the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> to abate a little of their Confidence: Let them examine with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Mind, upon what Foundations they build the belief of a Trinity; and they will ſoon perceive how weak and frail it is. Let them at laſt confeſs, that the Scripture does not threaten eternal Damnation to thoſe who disbelieve a Trinity: And then, if themſelves won't part with their darling Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; let them abſtain from perſecuting others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Trinitarians lay ſo much ſtreſs upon <hi>the Tradition of the Church</hi> concerning the Trinity, that I think it worth while to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64942:3"/>
undeceive them; by ſhewing, that there never was ſo great a Variation in the Church, as about this Point. I ſhall divide into three Periods all the Ages of the Church. The Firſt reaches to the Council of <hi>Nice:</hi> The Second from the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to the Schoolmen: And the Third from the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to our time.</p>
               <p>And one that is never ſo little acquainted with the Writings of the Fathers of the three firſt Centuries, cannot deny, if he be but ſincere; that thoſe Fathers follow the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Plato</hi> concerning the three Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and therefore ſpeak rather like <hi>Arians</hi> than <hi>Orthodox.</hi> They tell us, that the Son and Holy Ghoſt have each of them his own Nature and Eſſence, whereby they are diſtinguiſh'd from each other; and that the Son is ſubordinate and inferior to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both in Nature and Power; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Holy Ghoſt is ſubordinate to the Son. If any one deſires to ſee ſome unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Proofs of what I aſſert, I refer him to the <hi>Quaternio</hi> of <hi>Curcellaeus,</hi> whereby he will be fully ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>The ſucceeding Fathers finding fault with this Notion, brought into the World a new Interpretation of the three Principles. They won't have them to be ſubordinate, but equal both in Nature and Power. However they acknowledg them to be three Eſſences, or Collateral Beings. If you ask them, how they can avoid admitting a Plurality of Gods? They will anſwer, That thoſe three Beings are but one God, as <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> are but one Man. If you deny that <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> are but one Man; they will tell you, that you are miſtaken; becauſe in Propriety of Speech, this term <hi>Man</hi> ought not to ſignify an Individual, as <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>James,</hi> or <hi>John;</hi> but a ſpecifical Nature common to them all; ſo that thô they be three Individuals, or three Perſons; yet they are but one Man, being Partakers of the ſame ſpecifical common Nature. This they apply to their three Principles: They are indeed (ſay they) three Hypoſtaſes or Perſons, yet they are but one God: This term <hi>God</hi> denoting not an Individual Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſis, but a Nature common to the three Perſons of the Trinity, whereby thô they are three, yet they are ſaid to be but one God. Thus they made ſhift, as well as they could. It was indeed a very unſufficient way of explaining the Unity of God, and did by no means reſolve the difficulty. They made an abſtract ſpecifical God, <hi>(as the Heathens might equally have done)</hi> but there were ſtill three Individual or Numerical Gods; as <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> may be ſaid to be by Abſtraction one ſpecifical Man, becauſe they have the ſame ſpecifical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but however they are ſtill three Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Numerical Men.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Schoolmen diſliking this Notion, as favouring Polytheiſm, found out a new one more agreeable (as they thought) to the Unity of God. They won't have the three Perſons of the Trinity to have each of them his own Eſſence and Nature. No, this too plainly deſtroys the Unity of God. There is, ſay they, but one Divine Eſſence. Right! but then they muſt not part with three Perſons of the Trinity: Therefore, what are thoſe three Perſons? They are Three Subſiſtences; Three Modes; Three Relations; Three I know not whats. This is meer Nonſenſe: for a Perſon is an Intelligent Being, and Three Perſons muſt needs be Three Intelligent Beings. So true it is, that whoſoever acknowledges Three Perſons in the Godhead (if he takes the Word in its proper ſenſe) muſt admit Three Gods: Which the Learned Doctor cannot avoid, who ſays they are <hi>Three diſtinct Minds, Three ſubſtantial Beings, Three intelligent Beings;</hi> therefore unavoidably Three Gods.</p>
               <p>Now is it fair to boaſt ſo much of the Tradition concerning the Trinity, as if it had been conſtant and unalterable in all the Ages of the Church, when the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appears to any ſincere Reader? The Fathers who lived before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſpeak, like <hi>Platonic Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;</hi> the Nicene Fathers like <hi>Tritheiſts;</hi> and the School-men like <hi>Mad-men.</hi> Where
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64942:4"/>
now is that unchangeable Tradition, ſo much cried up? Conſidering the ridiculouſneſs of thoſe Men, who in their reſpective Ages ſet up new Notions of the Trinity; I am apt to ſay, contrary to <hi>Averroes</hi> his Wiſh, <hi>Let not my Soul be with the Philoſophers.</hi> To conclude this Chapter, thoſe great Boaſters of the (pretended) Tradition, ſhould do well to apply themſelves to the confuting the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternio</hi> of <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> before mentioned; which when they have fully and truly performed, we may perhaps begin to think of parting with Tradition, which indeed is not the Foundation whereon we build our Faith, <hi>Knowing</hi> only <hi>the Scriptures which are able to make wiſe unto Salvation.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Containing an Examination of the Doctor's Anſwers, to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the Trinity in the Hiſtory of the</hi> Unitarians.</head>
               <p>HAving premiſed this general Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I come to examine, what Anſwer the Doctor returns to the Arguments alledged againſt the Trinity, by the Author of <hi>the Brief Hiſtory of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I muſt firſt conſider his Reflections, concerning the uſe of Reaſon in expounding Scripture. <q>This is (ſaith he) an Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Argument, which brings Revelation down in ſuch ſublime Myſteries to the level of our Underſtandings, to ſay, ſuch a Doctrine cannot be contained in Scripture, becauſe it implies a Contradiction; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a modeſt Man would firſt inquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in Scripture or not; and if it he plainly contained there, he would conclude, how <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nintelligible</hi> ſoever it appeared to him, that yet there is no Contradiction in it,</q> becauſe it is taught in Scripture. <hi>p.</hi> 141.</p>
               <p>But is this Impudence, to ſay, Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation cannot be contained in Scripture, becauſe it implies a Contradiction? I hope not. Well then, if the Trinity implies no leſs Contradiction than Tranſubſtantiation; why can't we ſay, that it cannot be contained in Scripture? We ſay, Tranſubſtantiation cannot be found in Scripture, becauſe it is a plain Contradiction to our Reaſon; but if the Trinity be alſo a plain Contradiction to our Reaſon; why ſhan't we be allowed to ſay, that it cannot be contained in Scripture? I think both Conſequences are right. But ſaith the Author, <hi>A modeſt Man would firſt inquire whether it be in Scripture or not?</hi> But we have already made ſuch an Inquiry, and cannot find the Trinity in Scripture. We never could read there, that <hi>there are Three Perſons in one Numerical God.</hi> Indeed, how could we? We might as well find there, that <hi>the Bread of the Sacrament is Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into Chriſt's Body.</hi> But he goes on; <q>And if it be plainly contained there, he ſhould conclude, <hi>how <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nintelligible</hi> ſoever it appeared to him, that yet there is no Contradiction in it, becauſe it is taught in Scripture.</q> I beg the Author's pardon; there is a vaſt difference, between <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi> and <hi>Contradictions.</hi> He ſhould not have ſaid, How Unintelligible ſoever, but how Contradictions ſoever: And thus his Words ought to run; <q>He ſhould conclude, how <hi>Contradictions ſoever</hi> it appeared to him, that yet there is <hi>no Contradiction</hi> in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is taught by Scripture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I perceive, the Author found it too harſh to ſay that, how Contradictions ſoever a thing appears to be, that yet there is no Contradiction in it, becauſe it is taught by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64942:4"/>
Scripture; and therefore he puts the word <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nintelligible,</hi> inſtead of the word <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</hi> In effect, we do not ſay, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Unintelligible Thing contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a Contradiction. We acknowledg, the Reſurrection plainly ſet down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, does imply no Contradiction, how Unintelligible ſoever it be; becauſe we do very clearly conceive, that God is able to raiſe our dead Bodies. We don't apprehend the manner of this Reſurrection; how it ſhall be performed, is a thing Unintelligible to us; but however 'tis altogether free from a Contradiction. Were the Trinity as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down in Scripture, and as free from Contradiction; we would not disbelieve it, how Unintelligible ſoever it appeared to us, no more than we disbelieve the Reſurrection. But the Trinity being not only Unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but Contradictions; we deny it is taught in Scripture, which is altogether free from Contradiction.</p>
               <p>Let us hear the Author a little farther; <q>We muſt not indeed (ſaith he) expound Scripture contrary to common Senſe, and to the common Reaſon of Mankind, in ſuch Matters as every Man knows, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man can judge of; but in Matters of pure Revelation, which we have no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Idea of, and know nothing of them but what is revealed; we muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſome imaginary Contradictions, to reject <hi>the plain and expreſs</hi> Authority of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. For 'tis impoſſible to know, what is a Contradiction to the Nature of Things, whoſe Natures we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</q> 
                  <hi>We muſt not indeed expound Scripture, contrary to common Senſe, and the common Reaſon of Mankind, in ſuch Matters as every Man knows and every Man can judge of.</hi> I grant it; but what if the Trinity doth contradict <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reaſon of Mankind;</hi> and is of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>as every Man knows, and every Man can judge of?</hi> Then certainly it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, according to this Author himſelf. Indeed we cannot fathom the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of an infinite Being, no more than (as this Author ſaith) the Eſſence of any created Being; yet as we have a diſtinct knowledg of ſome Properties of a Finite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo we have a clear Apprehenſion of the Attributes of God. We cannot be miſtaken in the Notion of <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Three;</hi> we are moſt certain, that One is not Three, and that Three are not One. The moſt ſimple Men have a clear Apprehenſion of thoſe two Numbers, and therefore are able to judge of them. Now the Scripture plainly tells us, that there is but One God; and every one knows that <hi>One God is One Intelligent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perſon,</hi> and therefore cannot be Three ſuch Perſons. He that has an Idea of <hi>One,</hi> and an Idea of <hi>Three,</hi> muſt needs perceive that it implies a Contradiction, that One be Three, and Three One; that one God be Three Intelligent Infinite Perſons or Beings, and Three Intelligent Infinite Beings One God; This every one can judge of. <hi>Therefore we muſt not expound Scripture</hi> (ſaith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) <hi>contrary to common Senſe, and the common Reaſon of Mankind; in ſuch Matters as every Man knows, and every Man can judge of:</hi> Therefore (ſay I) all being capable of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether <hi>One</hi> may be <hi>Three,</hi> and <hi>Three One;</hi> and finding it a plain Contradiction to the common Reaſon of Mankind; all may be aſſured, that it cannot be contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But (ſaith the Author) in Matters of pure Revelation, which we have no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Idea of, and know nothing of 'em but what is revealed; we muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſome imaginary Contradictions, to reject <hi>the plain and expreſs</hi> Authority of Scripture and Revelation; for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to know, what is a Contradiction to the Natures of Things, whoſe Natures we do not underſtand.</q> Now what does the Author mean by <hi>the plain and expreſs</hi> Authority of Revelation? Does he mean, that he has found ſomewhere in Scripture in <hi>plain and expreſs</hi> Words, that <hi>there are Three Perſons in one Divine Nature or Godhead?</hi> If it be ſo, let him ſhew us it. I doubt he calls <hi>plain and expreſs Authority,</hi> ſome falſe <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,</hi> which he is pleaſed to draw from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64942:5"/>
Scripture, and which none but prejudiced Men would ever think of.</p>
               <p>I wiſh we could ſhew a <hi>Chineſe,</hi> the Goſpel well tranſlated into his own Language; and ask him, after a ſerious reading of it, what he thought Chriſt to be? It is very likely, I think, that he would not take him to be the ſupream God; and if any Man ſhould tell him, he had overſeen ſo great a Myſtery; he would undoubtedly anſwer, that he is ſure there is no ſuch thing in the Goſpel which he read, unleſs there he another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel wherein ſuch a Notion is contained. I confeſs there are ſome Matters of Revelation, which we have no natural Idea of; and know nothing of them but what is revealed; ſuch is the Reſurrection of the Dead: But then thoſe Matters imply no Contradiction, and therefore ought not to be rejected. This firſt (the Reſurrection) may be diſcovered to us by the Light of Revelation; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering no Contradiction in it, we ought to believe it. The ſecond (the Trinity) claſhing altogether with our natural Ideas, can be no Matter of Revelation, and therefore ought not to be believed. The Reſurrection is ſuch a Thing, as we could never have diſcovered by the Light of Nature; yet as ſoon as we come to know it, we aſſent to it, becauſe we clearly perceive the Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof, and are ſure it implies no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction at all: but it is not ſo with the Trinity; ſuch a Myſtery can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us, becauſe Revelation cannot be contrary to Reaſon; and therefore the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity being contrary to this, cannot be the Matter of that. God indeed may reveal to us ſuch Objects, as are unknown to Humane Reaſon; but let them be never ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our Reaſon, they will never contradict it. <hi>It is impoſſible to know, what is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Nature of Things, whoſe Natures we do not underſtand.</hi> Right! But we know ſo much of the Nature of God, that He is One, and not Three; and this is ſufficient to ſhow that the Trinity is a Contradiction to the Nature of God.</p>
               <p>What I ſay, is ſo clear and ſo notorious a Truth, that the Author himſelf is forced to acknowledg it; He ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 147. <q>We muſt not expound Scripture to ſuch a Senſe, as contradicts the plain and expreſs Maxims of natural Reaſon: For though God reveals ſuch Things to us, as natural Reaſon could not diſcover, and cannot comprehend; yet <hi>Revelation cannot contradict plain Reaſon;</hi> for Truth cannot contradict it ſelf; what is true in Revelation, can never be falſe in Reaſon; and what is true by natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</q> can never be falſe in Revelation. All this he grants, only he ſaith, that we muſt be ſure there is ſuch a Contradiction; it muſt be evident and expreſs, and not made out by uncertain Conſequences, which many times are not owing to the Nature of Things, but to the Imperfection of our own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. This I grant too; But the Author won't allow the Trinity to be ſuch a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and endeavours to prove it: Let us hear him.</p>
               <p>He ſoon perceives the difficulty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brings it in by way of an Objection. <q>Yes, you'l ſay, that there ſhould be Three Perſons, each of which is God, and yet but One God, is a Contradiction. But what Principle of natural Reaſon does it contradict? Reaſon tells us, that Three Gods cannot be One God; but does Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tell us, that Three Divine Perſons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be One God? If my Reaſon be like other Mens, I am ſure my Reaſon ſays no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all about it, does neither affirm nor deny it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Is not this an admirable Argument, which conſiſts only in an Interrogation, and in a meer denial of the difficulty propoſed in the Objection? <hi>What Principle of natural Reaſon does it contradict? Does Reaſon tell us, that Three Divine Perſons cannot be one God?</hi> Here is the Interrogation or Query. To which I anſwer; Yes, it does contradict a plain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of natural Reaſon, even this, that Three cannot be One. <hi>If my Reaſon be like other Mens, I am ſure my Reaſon ſays nothing at all about it, doth neither affirm nor deny it.</hi> Here
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64942:5"/>
is a meer denial of the difficulty: I judge the Author's Reaſon muſt needs be very weak and corrupted, ſeeing it likes well this falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that Three are One; and finds no fault with it. Thoſe unqueſtionably have a better ſight, and a more ſound Reaſon, who diſcern, it implies a Contradiction, that Three be but One; becauſe they perceive and acknowledg that <hi>Three is three times One,</hi> and therefore cannot be only <hi>once One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Well (ſaith the Doctor, pleading for his Adverſaries) if we believe Three diſtinct Divine Perſons, each of which is God, we muſt believe Three diſtinct Gods. <hi>I hope not,</hi> when we profeſs to believe but One God: Yes, whatever we profeſs to believe, Three ſuch diſtinct Perſons muſt be Three Gods. Now <hi>this we deny,</hi> and <hi>challenge them</hi> to produce any plain Principle of Reaſon to prove that it muſt be ſo. Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon teaches Nothing about the Perſonality of the Godhead: it teaches One God, but whether this One God be One or Three Perſons, it ſays not, and therefore He may be either, without contradicting the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Notions we have of One God; and then there is free ſcope for Revelation; and if Revelation teaches there is but One God, and that there are Three Divine Perſons, each of which hath (in Scripture) not only the Title, but the Nature and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God aſcribed to him, then we muſt of neceſſity believe a Trinity in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Three Perſons and one God. For what the Scripture affirms, and Reaſon does not deny, is a proper Object of our Faith; and then this Objection againſt this Faith, that Three diſtinct Divine Perſons muſt be Three diſtinct Gods, if each of them be God,</q> is ſenſleſs and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>I have tranſcribed this whole Paragraph, becauſe it deſerves ſome particular Reflection. 1. I obſerve, that it contains no poſitive Proofs, but a meer denial. The Author is extreamly confident and bold; and yet all his reaſonings may be reſolved into <hi>I hope not,</hi> and <hi>this we deny.</hi> Indeed this is a very ſhort way of anſwering Objections; and as eaſy as to <hi>burn Books that are unanſwerable.</hi> There lies an Objection croſs in his way, that if we believe Three diſtinct Divine Perſons, we muſt believe Three diſtinct Gods. To this he anſwers, I hope not, when we profeſs to believe but one God. Is this a direct Confutation? muſt we be ſatisfied with ſuch an Anſwer: becauſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians profeſs that Three Divine Perſons are but one God; does it follow, that it is true, and cannot be doubted of? He <hi>hopes not,</hi> and he <hi>denies it,</hi> therein lies the ſtrength of his Argument and Anſwer. 2. I ſhould have added, <hi>he challenges;</hi> for this is his third way of confuting Objections. He challenges us to produce any plain Principle of Reaſon, to prove that Three diſtinct Divine Perſons muſt be Three Gods. But we have a plain Principle of Reaſon at hand, to anſwer his Challenge, to wit, that it implies a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction that Three be but One. 3. Here is a moſt abſurd and ridiculous Paradox, as I ever heard of; <hi>Natural Reaſon teaches nothing about the Perſonality of God or the Godhead; it teaches One God; but whether this One God be One or Three Perſons, it ſays not.</hi> What? If Reaſon tells us that <hi>there is One God;</hi> He muſt be One Intelligent Being. Now according to Reaſon we have no other Idea of Unity, but ſuch as we have of a Man, a Beaſt, and a Tree. Therefore as Reaſon teaches that a Man is one Perſon, becauſe he is one Intelligent Being; ſo it follows that according to Human Reaſon, God is but one Perſon, being but one Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Being. Reaſon does not tell us that the Unity of God is different from the Unity of a Man: it produces in our Minds the ſame Idea of both; which being applied to God as well as to Man, muſt needs denote One Perſon or Intelligent Being in oppoſition to Two or Three. Nay, if Reaſon teaches nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Perſonality of the Godhead (which the Author does not think fit to prove) <hi>what Idea can we have of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of God by Reaſon?</hi> As long as we are ignorant, whether God be one or three Perſons; our Idea of him muſt needs be more imperfect than of any other Being, in that very Notion which is ſo familiar to us, and which God himſelf has ſo much
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64942:6"/>
urged, <hi>viz.</hi> his Unity. This is ſo falſe a Principle, and ſo contrary to the Dictates of Reaſon, that there never was any Man, <hi>taught by Reaſon</hi> that there is but one God, but did believe at the ſame time, that He is but one Perſon. The Author ſhould not have ventur'd abroad ſuch a Philoſophy, contrary to the Reaſon of all Mankind; but ought to have kept it for himſelf. Now I find that the Scripture doth perfectly agree with Reaſon. This tells me that there is but one God, who is but one Perſon; That teaches me the ſame, and alſo that the Father of our Lord Chriſt is that one God: both of them contrary to the Doctrine of the Trinity. 4. He ſaith; that there are Three Divine Perſons, each of which have (in Scripture) not only the Title, but the Nature and Attributes of God aſcribed to them. But where is the Holy Ghoſt called God in Scripture? He is indeed called the Spirit of God, but never God himſelf; and being the Power of God, 'tis no wonder that ſuch things are aſcribed to him, as are aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God himſelf. Thus it is ordinary to aſcribe to a Man's Courage, what he has done himſelf; and yet his Courage is no Perſon, nor diſtinct from him. This I ſay only by the way, to ſhew the ſtrangeneſs of his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. But I ſhall ſay nothing here of the Son: and indeed ſeeing he brings no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Inſtances of what he advances, there is no need to inſiſt any longer upon it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>I come now to examine his Anſwers, to the Objections againſt the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the brief Hiſtory of the</hi> Unitarians.</head>
               <p>THE Firſt Objection, <hi>p.</hi> 154. <hi>If our Lord Chriſt were himſelf God; there could be no Perſon greater than He, none that might be called his Head or God, none that could in any reſpect command him.</hi> Let us hear, How the Doctor anſwers this Objection. <q>Now (ſaith he) this Argument is fallacious; for tho Chriſt be God himſelf, yet if there be Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the God-head, the Equality and Sameneſs of Nature does not deſtroy the Subordination of the Perſons: A Son is Equal to his Father by Nature, but Inferior to him as his Son.</q> Now where is the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, but in the Author's Anſwer? His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of a Father with his Son, is ſhort of his purpoſe: for tho a Son be equal to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Nature, yet he is not equal to him in Authority and Power; and therefore a Father is truly greater than his Son, is <hi>his Head,</hi> and <hi>can command him.</hi> This is not meerly a Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Order, but of Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity alſo. But it is not ſo with the Father and Son in the Trinity: they are not only equal by Nature, in the Author's Hypotheſis, but in Power and Authority; as they have the ſame Nature, ſo they have the ſame Attributes, whereby they are equal to one another in all Things. Now if it be ſo; how can the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſaid to be <hi>greater</hi> than the Son, <hi>who is as great as himſelf?</hi> How can he be called his <hi>Head,</hi> which imports ſome Authority over Chriſt. As appears from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>But I would have you know, that the Head of every Man is Chriſt; and the Head of the Woman is the Man; and the Head of Chriſt is God.</hi> It appears by this place, that God is the Head of Chriſt, as Chriſt is the Head of every Man, and the Man the Head of the Woman. Now Chriſt's being the Head of every Man, imports ſome Power and Authority over e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man, as the Man's being Head of the Woman imports a Power and Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64942:6"/>
the Woman; and conſequently God's being the Head of Chriſt, muſt import an Authority and Power over Chriſt; elſe the Compariſon would be unreaſonable, fallacious and impertinent. But, I ſay, how can God be called the Head of Chriſt, in ſuch a Senſe? if Chriſt be as Great, and have as great Power and Authority as God has, how can God be called <hi>his God?</hi> To be ones God, is as much as to be his Benefactor and his Protector, according to the ſtile of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but Chriſt being All-mighty and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, how can the Father be ſtiled his God, that is, his Benefactor and Protector? <hi>I aſcend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God,</hi> John 20. 17. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Mat. 27. 46. How could Chriſt ſay theſe things, on the Doctor's Hypotheſis; for being God as well as the Father, He muſt no leſs forſake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than the Father forſook him; and he might as well call himſelf <hi>his own God,</hi> and complain of himſelf that he had forſaken himſelf: Nay, being himſelf Almighty God as well as the Father, and being able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himſelf in his Sufferings; how comes he to invoke the Father, or to call him <hi>his God?</hi> for thoſe Words plainly ſhew, that He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and deſired from the Father the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which He could not perform to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Furthermore, how can we forbear conceiving Two Gods, according to this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis? Chriſt, who invokes the Father, is God; the Father, whom He invokes, is God alſo; conſequently there are Two diſtinct Gods. Can he that invokes, and he that is invoked, be one and the ſame Being? I always thought that this ſuppoſed two ſeveral Beings. Laſtly, If our Lord Chriſt were himſelf God, how could any command him? He has all the Power and all the Authority, that the Father has; He is no more ſubject to the Father, than the Father to him; nay the Father and He are but One God.</p>
               <p>The Author goes on; <q>If the Father, as I have explained it, be original Mind and Wiſdom; the Son a Perſonal ſubſiſting, but reflex Image of the Father's Wiſdom; thô their Eternal Wiſdom be equal and the ſame, yet the Original is Superiour to the Image, the Father to the Son: And therefore thô I know ſuch Texts as he alledges, <hi>My Father is greater than I; The Head of Chriſt is God; I aſcend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God;</hi> are both by Ancient and Modern Expoſitors applied to Chriſt's humane Nature; yet I ſee no Inconvenience, in owning this to be true, with reſpect to his Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his Relation to the Father: For the Father is the Head and Fountain of the Deity; and therefore the Father may be called his God.</q> Let us conſider this Paragraph.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Son is a Perſonal Subſiſting, but Reflex Image of his Father's Wiſdom.</hi> What Gibbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh is this! Has the Doctor found any where in Scripture, that the Son is <hi>a Perſonal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, but Reflex Image of his Father's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi> Why does he not ſpeak the Language of Scripture? If his Words have any Senſe, he means, that the Father reflects upon his own Knowledge and Wiſdom: but how comes he to fancy, that a reflected Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or to reflect on ones own Wiſdom, is a Divine Perſon and an Intelligent Being? One would think it only <hi>an Act</hi> of God, to reflect upon his own Knowledg, or other Perfections, without dreaming of a <hi>Divine Perſon;</hi> but Metaphyſicians, it ſeems, have a clearer Sight than other People: what is to others only an Act of God, the Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician diſcerns to be a Divine Perſon. 2. <hi>The Original,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>is Superiour to the Image, the Father to the Son.</hi> But the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in the Trinity is only a Superiority of Order, which can admit of no ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as <hi>Greater than Chriſt, the Head of Chriſt, the God of Chriſt;</hi> as I ſhewed before. He ſees, he ſaith, no Inconvenience in own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this to be true with reſpect to Chriſt's <hi>Divine Perſon,</hi> and his Relation to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe the Father is the Head and Fountain of the Deity. I will ſhew more particularly, the ridiculouſneſs of this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64942:7"/>
by inſiſting upon the firſt of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages before cited, as I have done upon the two others. Our Saviour ſeeing his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſorrowful, becauſe He had told them, that He was going to his Father; and being willing to comfort them, and to leſſen their Sadneſs; tells them <hi>(John</hi> 14. 18.) <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I ſaid, I go unto the Father; For my Father is greater than I.</hi> One would think that Chriſt's meaning is, That the Diſciples ſhould be glad to hear that he leaves the World to go to his Father; becauſe his Father being greater than He, would undoubtedly crown his Obedience with an immortal Glory, and a Name which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every Name. But this Author has found out another Senſe, which is worth the obſerving; <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I ſaid I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I; that is to ſay, the Father is the Head and Fountain of the Deity.</hi> This would have been a very unſignificant Comfort; Be not ſorrowful for my leaving this World and going to the Father; <hi>For the Father is the firſt Perſon of the Trinity.</hi> Yet this ought to be the Interpretation of this Paſſage, if the Author's Aſſertion be true. Now I think the true meaning of this Phraſe, the Father is the Head and Fountain of the Deity, ſhould be this, <hi>the Father is the firſt God;</hi> as the Son is the ſecond God, and the Holy Ghoſt the third God. This Author may ſay ſo, if he pleaſes; I ſhan't contradict him, for that's the Conſequence that flows naturally from his Principles. But I ſhall deny, that the Father may be called <hi>the God of Chriſt:</hi> if Chriſt be the ſupream God as well as his Father, how can the ſupream God have a God over him? The term <hi>God</hi> relates only to Creatures; God cannot be ſaid to be the God of any but Creatures; this, common Senſe and the whole Current of Scripture teaches. Yes, you'l ſay, the Father is the Head and Fountain of the Deity. I anſwer, therefore you may in your Hypotheſis call him the firſt God; but by no means the God of the Son or Spirit, to whom He is not Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour in Power, Authority, or other Divine Attribute.</p>
               <p>The Author ſpeaks an unintelligible Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon in his following Paragraph, which (I think) there is no need to inſiſt on: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall here leave it to every rational Man to judge, whether we ought to reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with ſuch a trifling Anſwer to the propounded Objection.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection, <hi>p.</hi> 155. <q>If our Lord Chriſt were indeed God, it could not without Blaſphemy be (abſolutely and without Reſtriction) affirmed of him, that He is the Creature, the Poſſeſſion, the Servant, and the Subject of God. To this the Author anſwers thus; That Chriſt is called a Creature, he proves, becauſe He is <hi>the Firſt-born of every Creature,</hi> Col. 1. 15. But here he ſhould have remembred his <hi>Abſolutely, and without Reſtriction;</hi> for Chriſt is ſo the Firſt-born of every Creature, that He is <hi>the Image of the Inviſible God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Creature.</q> Surely, an abſurd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: I ſay on the contrary; Chriſt is the Image of the Inviſible God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Creature. Let us ſee which of us is in the right. Every one may plainly ſee that, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Chriſt the Image of the Inviſible God, he means, that He is a Viſible Image of an Inviſible God; and therefore he added the Epithet <hi>Inviſible;</hi> which otherways had been uſeleſs, not to ſay ridiculous. For then the Senſe of the Apoſtle's Expreſſion muſt be this; Chriſt is the Inviſible Image of the Inviſible God. Now the Nature of an Image is to be viſible to every ones Eye; or elſe it is no Image: But if Chriſt is called the Image of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God, becauſe He is the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Trinity; this ſecond Perſon being as Inviſible as the firſt, it follows that Chriſt is an Image of God as Inviſible as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; which is ridiculous. No, no; the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt is the Image of the Inviſible God, by reaſon of his unſpotted Holineſs, and of the ſupream Power and Authority conferred on him. He is the Brightneſs of God's Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon; but ſuch an Image as <hi>was Viſible</hi> while He lived upon Earth; and may <hi>now be ſeen</hi> of all the

Inhabitants of Heaven. Beſides, it does plainly appear by the Context, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Man,</hi> the Image of the Inviſible God. <hi>Who</hi> (the Father) ſaith he at Ver. 13. <hi>has delivered us from the Power of Darkneſs, and has tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>In whom we have Redemption thrô his Blood, even the forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi> Ver. 15. <hi>Who is the Image of the Inviſible God, the Firſt-born of every Creature.</hi> There you ſee, that He who is the Image of the Inviſible God, is that dear Son in whom we have Redemption thrô his Blood; but He who <hi>ſhed his Blood</hi> for the Redemption of Men, muſt be Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Man;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Man</hi> is the Image of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God. Now let any unprejudiced Man judge, which of theſe two Conſequences is right, either this of the Author, Chriſt is the Image of the Inviſible God, therefore no Creature; or mine, Chriſt is the Image of the Inviſible God, therefore a Creature.</p>

               <p>Now let us ſuppoſe, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ought to ſignify <hi>born before all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> I deny that, therefore Himſelf is no part of the Creation. The plain meaning of <hi>born before all Creatures,</hi> is, that Chriſt was born before any other Creature: As theſe Words, <hi>Adam was born before all Men,</hi> do not ſignify that he is no Creature, or no Man, but only that he was the firſt Man created. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſay, ſuppoſing that theſe Words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are well tranſlated by <hi>born before all Creatures,</hi> I may with great reaſon draw a Conſequence contrary to the Author's, thus; Chriſt is born before all Creatures, therefore He is part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Author is very unhappy at drawing Conſequences. Here is another as falſe as the former; <q>That this does not relate to the New Creation, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it, is very plain. For, 1. In this Senſe Chriſt (if He were a meer Man) was not the Firſt-born of every New Creature. For I hope, there were a great many New Creatures, that is, truly Good and Pious Men, before Chriſt was born of his Virgin Mother.</q> What? ſuppoſing <hi>the New Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Goſpel,</hi> is here meant; can't Chriſt as a meer Man be the Firſt-born of every New-Creature; being the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Author and firſt Preacher of the Goſpel, the Head of the Church, the Fountain from which the Holineſs of every New Evangelical Creature does ſpring? In a Word, being the Author of this New Evangelical Creation, can't He alſo be the Firſt-born of every New Evangelical Creature? Thoſe <hi>Socinians</hi> that he ſpeaks of, by the New-Creation mean nothing elſe, but the New-Creation wrought by Chriſt and his Goſpel: and therefore, either this Author impoſes on them; or is not fully acquainted with their Opinions; or has no great Skill in Reaſoning.</p>
               <p>I ſee, the Author does not underſtand the above-cited place. Therefore I think it worth while to explain it; the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis one of the ſtrongeſt Holds of the <hi>Trinitarians;</hi> and to ſhow, that inſtead of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring their Opinion, it overthrows it. In order thereunto; 1. I will prove, that the Old Creation, that is the Creation of the World, is not intended in that Text. 2. I will ſet down, what I take to be the true Senſe of that whole Context.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Creation of the World is not there meant. This I ſhall prove by Four Arguments. 1. He who is the Firſt-born of every Creature, is the ſame who ſhed his Blood <hi>(ver.</hi> 14.) for the Redemption of Men; as I noted before. Now he who <hi>ſhed his Blood</hi> for the Redemption of Men, can be no other but Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Man:</hi> but this very Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt <hi>Man</hi> is there ſtiled <hi>the Firſt-born of every Creature, by whom all things were created, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:64942:8"/>
as we tranſlate the Words; Therefore this cannot be meant of the Creation of the World, which is the Work of God, not of a Man. Yes, you'l ſay; for He is God as well as Man; and therefore may be ſaid to have created the World. I anſwer; Where have you found in Scripture, that <hi>Christ is God as well as Man?</hi> I know He is called <hi>Man</hi> in the Writings of the New Teſtament; but I could never find him there ſtiled <hi>God-Man,</hi> as He ſhould have often been, if He was both. Does the Apoſtle make a diſtinction between his two Natures? does he ſay, we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption thrô his Blood, <hi>as He is a Man?</hi> and that He is the Firſt-born of every Creature, and has created all Things, <hi>as He is God?</hi> Not at all; but only tells us, That the ſame Jeſus Chriſt, in whom we have redemption thrô his Blood, is the Firſt-born of every Creature, and by whom all Things were created, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why ſhould we contrive a diſtinction of our own, when the Apoſtle makes none? But 2. I cannot but wonder, that Men ſhould attribute the old or firſt Creation to Chriſt, ſince we have no Warrant from Scripture for it: I mean, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does never ſay in expreſs Words, that <hi>Chriſt has created Heaven and Earth,</hi> (which is the proper Deſcription of the Old Creation, or of the Creation ſtrictly and properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and the Deſcription uſual in Scripture when it ſpeaks of that Creation) as it is ſaid that God <hi>the Father of Christ</hi> has. I do obſerve ſo great a difference between the Expreſſions of the Sacred Writers concerning the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World by God, and thoſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which are ſuppoſed to import the ſame Creation by Chriſt; that I cannot forbear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging ſome places concerning both. I omit thoſe of the Old Teſtament, which are ſo many; and will inſiſt only upon ſome taken out of the New. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17. 24.) <hi>that made the World and all things therein, ſeeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with Hands.</hi> And Acts 4. 11. <hi>Lord, thou art God, which haſt made Heaven, and Earth, and the Sea, and all that in them is.</hi> Acts 14. 15. <hi>We—preach unto you, that ye ſhould turn from theſe Vanities, unto the Living God, which made Heaven, and Earth, and the Sea, and all things that are therein.</hi> And Rev. 14. 7. <hi>Fear God,—and worſhip him, that made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and the Fountains of Water.</hi> This is the true and proper Deſcription of the Creation of the World. Were it aſcribed to Chriſt in ſuch expreſs Terms, we could not doubt that Chriſt had created the World: which if the Apoſtles had believed, they would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have taught us ſo great a Truth, and that both in expreſs and plain Terms, and often. No, Chriſt is never ſaid to have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <hi>Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that is therein.</hi> In this very place the Apoſtle does not ſay, that the Firſt-born created Heaven and Earth; but <hi>All things that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth:</hi> and the <hi>All Things</hi> of which he ſpeaketh, he limiteth to all <hi>Thrones, Dominions, Principalities and Powers,</hi> viſible and inviſible; which ſhall be explained here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. This ſecond Reflection, that <hi>this Text contains not the proper Deſcription of the Creation of the World uſed in Scripture,</hi> being added to the foregoing, that <hi>this Context ſpeaks of Chriſt as Man;</hi> ought to perſwade any unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Man, that the Creation of the World is not here attributed to Chriſt. The Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians were ſo far from believing, that Chriſt created the World; that, as <hi>the Father</hi> only is called <hi>God</hi> in the Apoſtles Creed, ſo He only is ſtiled <hi>Maker of Heaven and Earth.</hi> 3. As the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> is an excellent Commentary on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> ſo the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> muſt be made uſe of, for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> The Deſign and Scope of thoſe two Epiſtles is the ſame; ſo that we muſt look into the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to find out the true Senſe of this controverted Text in the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> Now he that ſeriouſly compares theſe two Epiſtles with one another, will find that <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 15, 16, 17, 18. muſt be interpreted by <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 10. is a true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 18. runs thus, <hi>And He is the Head of the Body, the Church:</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64942:8"/>
                  <hi>who is the Beginning, the Firſt-born from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence.</hi> To which anſwers part of the <hi>22d verſe</hi> in the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> in theſe Words; <hi>And gave him to be Head over all things to the Church.</hi> Col. 1. 15, 16, 17. runs thus; <hi>Who is the Image of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God, the Firſt-born of every Creature: for by him were all things created</hi> (as we tranſlate the Word) <hi>that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, viſible and inviſible; whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: all things were created by him and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt.</hi> To theſe Verſes do anſwer the 20, 21, and part of the <hi>22d</hi> verſe of <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> in theſe Words; <hi>He</hi> (God) <hi>raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right Hand in the Heavenly Places, far above all Principality and Power, and Might and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and every Name that is named, not only in this World, but in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his Feet.</hi> Now in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> we ſee, there is not the leaſt intimation of the Creation aſcribed to Chriſt; but only of his exaltation above all the Orders of Angels, and all earthly Powers: which plainly ſhows, that the Apoſtle meant not the Creation of the World in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Verſes of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> Nay, were it ſo, he would ſpeak Non-ſenſe. In the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> he would tell us that Chriſt has created all the Orders of Angels, the viſible and inviſible Thrones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which plainly ſhows that He is thereby as far above them, as the Creator is above his Creatures: but in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> he would tell us, that Chriſt <hi>has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted</hi> far above all the Orders of Angels, and all Earthly Thrones and Powers; which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably proves, that He was not ſo before. Now what is a Contradiction, if this be not, to ſay that Chriſt created them, and that the Father ſet him far above them? We muſt therefore of neceſſity explain the Context of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> by that of the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> and put ſuch a Senſe upon it, as imports no true and proper Creation. 4. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 19, 20. being interpreted by <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 10. is a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what I have ſaid hitherto. The former <hi>(Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 19, 20.) runs thus; <hi>For it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell; and (having made Peace through the Blood of his Croſs) by him to reconcile all things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; by him, I ſay, whether they be things in Earth, or things in Heaven.</hi> To which anſwers the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Text <hi>(Eph.</hi> 2. 10.) in theſe Words; <hi>That in the Diſpenſation of the fulneſs of time, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in Heaven, and which are in Earth, even in him.</hi> No Man, I hope, will deny that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which we render <hi>to Reconcile,</hi> ought to be interpreted by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Text of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>to gather together in one,</hi> or to <hi>ſum up.</hi> So that the meaning of both places is this, that it pleaſed God in the fulneſs of time, to unite both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men under one Head, even Chriſt, whom he ſet up Lord and King over them. Now this does perfectly agree with what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> concerning Chriſt's exaltation above all the Orders of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and his being Head of the Church: for his Argument runs thus; God has exalted Chriſt above all the Orders of Angels, and made him Head of the Church, for he had decreed, in the fulneſs of time to unite both Angels and Men under one Head, Chriſt. But if the Text of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> is meant of the Creation of the World; this will be perfect Non-ſenſe; for thus it ought to run: <hi>Chriſt has created</hi> all Orders of Angels, and all Powers on Earth, and was made Head of the Church; for <hi>God had decreed,</hi> in the fulneſs of time <hi>to unite both Angels and Men under one Head, Christ.</hi> No Man in the World can ſpeak greater Non-ſenſe than this would be, were the Creation of the World aſcribed to Chriſt in the controverted Text. I deſire the Author to reconcile his explication of theſe Words, <hi>that in all things he might have the preeminence,</hi> with what follows. That is (ſays he, at <hi>p.</hi> 157.) <hi>that he might be the</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Firſt upon all accounts, before the Worlds, and the Firſt-born from the dead.</hi> So the whole Argument (according to the Author) muſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64942:9"/>
run thus; Chriſt was the Firſt upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, <hi>before the Worlds,</hi> and the Firſt-born from the Dead; for God was pleaſed, <hi>in the fulneſs of time</hi> to unite both Angels and Men under Chriſt, as their Head. Could any thing be ſaid more abſurd and ridiculous? The Author's Skill in Scripture and Reaſon is, I think, alike.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Having thus proved that the Old Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or the Creation properly ſo called, is not aſcribed to Chriſt in this Context of the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> I come now to explain its true Senſe, as clearly as poſſibly I can. Ver. 15. <hi>Who is the Image of the Inviſible God, the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of every Creature.</hi> The meaning of theſe laſt Words is not, that Chriſt was begotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Creatures, as this Author would have it, but that <hi>He is the Lord and King of every</hi> (Intelligent) <hi>Creature;</hi> in Alluſion to the Firſt-born of a Family, who is Heir of all Things. This I prove by the 17 and <hi>18th</hi> Verſes; <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>And He is before all things,</hi> is the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>the Firſt-born of every Creature;</hi> and ſignifies, not that He is before all Creatures in order of time, but of Dignity and Power, being by God ſet over all the Orders of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and over the Church, as their Head and King. But if you don't reſt ſatisfied with this parallel Place, the <hi>18th</hi> Verſe will afford an undeniable proof of what I ſay: There you find, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is rightly rendred in our Bibles, <hi>That in all things He might have the Preeminence,</hi> both in Heaven and in Earth, among Angels and in the Church. I ſay now, theſe laſt Words ought to be the Explication of the two before-mentioned Expreſſions; to be <hi>the Firſt-born of every Creature,</hi> and to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Things,</hi> ought to be interpreted by his <hi>having the Praeeminence in all Things:</hi> ſo that <hi>He is the Firſt-born of every Creature,</hi> is this, <hi>He hath the Preeminence over every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Thus by the Context it ſelf, we find out the true ſenſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in the Engliſh we tranſlate <hi>Firſt-born of every Creature:</hi> And thus too are theſe Words interpreted by the principal Critics among the Orthodox, (as they are called) <hi>Gomarus, Camero, Piſcator, Druſius, Vorſtius, Davenant, Dally, Grotius,</hi> (for they will have him alſo to be Orthodox) <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the next Verſe, <hi>For by him were all Things created.</hi> I have fully proved, they cannot be underſtood of the Old Creation, the Creation of Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and of the Things in them, which is the Creation properly ſo called; therefore to reconcile this Verſe with the foregoing, and with the Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians, (He</hi> [God] <hi>ſet Him at his own Right-Hand, far above all Principality and Power,—and every Name that is named;)</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we render <hi>Created,</hi> ought to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Modelled, Diſpoſed,</hi> or <hi>Reformed</hi> into a new Order. So that the Senſe will run thus; <q>Chriſt is <hi>the Lord</hi> of every Creature, for by him are all both Viſible and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Creatures, even all Men and Angels, Modelled or Diſpoſed into a new Order, being ſubjected to Him and His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: As for Angels, all the Orders of them, whether they be Thrones or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, none of them are exempted from his Power and Authority; he rules over them, (which is the meaning of Ver. 17.) and they are all as it were compacted in one Body under his Conduct; as for Men, as He is the Beginning and the Firſt-born from the Dead, ſo He was alſo made Head of the Church his Body; ſo that in all things He has the Preeminence, He rules in Heaven and on Earth, over Angels and over the Church,</q> which is the Senſe of Ver. 18. This I hope makes a clear Senſe, agreeable to the whole Context, and to the Text in the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> I obſerve that as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>He is before all Things,</hi> is the Explication of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or <hi>He is the Firſt-born of every Creature:</hi> So <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>and by him all Things conſiſt,</hi> or are compacted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Body, ought to be the Explication of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>all Things</hi> (not <hi>created,</hi> as 'tis rendred in the Engliſh, but) Modelled or Reformed. I know not, why Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> has called this a Socinian Explication; as if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by them, to ſerve their Hypotheſis; the truth is, the chief of the Orthodox In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, have thus explained this Context of the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> Among the Ancients, St. <hi>Cyril, Fulgentius, Procopius, Gazeus,</hi> and even <hi>Athanaſius</hi> himſelf: Of the Moderns, <hi>Salmero, Montanus, Grotius,</hi> and many more. Before I put an end to this, I muſt obſerve; that our Author is greatly miſtaken in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. The Apoſtle (ſays he) proceeds from Chriſt's Creation of the natural World, to his Mediatory Kingdom: Which proves, that He did not ſpeak of that before. I ſee the Author does not obſerve his own rule <hi>(p.</hi> 146.) <hi>To conſider,</hi> in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scripture, what goes before, and what follows.</hi> It was no hard matter to ſee, that the Apoſtle at Ver. 16. ſpeaks, Firſt in the general of Things that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, Viſible and Inviſible: but then afterwards he explains, what he meant by the Things that are in Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> all the Orders of Angels; this he doth in the latter part of the ſame Verſe; and what he means by Things that are on Earth, He tells us fully at Ver. 18. <hi>viz.</hi> the Church. The <hi>18th</hi> Verſe, being an Explication of ſome part of Ver. 16. it appears not to have been <hi>Paul</hi>'s Deſign, to proceed from Chriſt's Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the World to his Mediatory King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Thus I have done with the famous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Author of <hi>the Brief Hiſtory</hi> had proved, that Chriſt was God's Miniſter and Servant, becauſe He was <hi>appointed or made by God, the Apoſtle and High-Prieſt of our Profeſſion.</hi> To this the Author, I am now conſidering, Anſwers; <q>But here is <hi>a Reſtriction</hi> to his being High-Prieſt, and therefore no danger of Blaſphemy, tho He be God. For we may obſerve, that thô the Jewiſh High-Prieſt was but a Man, yet he was a type of an High-Prieſt who is more than Man, even the eternal Son, or <hi>Word</hi> of God; as ſome of the Learned Jews acknowledge.</q> This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an admirable Anſwer; Chriſt has been appointed by God an High-Prieſt, which ſeems to prove, that Himſelf is not God. No, ſays the Doctor, you are miſtaken; for thô the Jewiſh High-Prieſt was but a Man, yet He was a Type of an High-Prieſt more than Man, of an High-Prieſt who is the eternal Son of God. How does he prove it? <hi>As ſome,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of the Learned Jews acknowledge.</hi> And what then; if ſome Learned Jews have ſpoken non-ſenſe, muſt we ſpeak non-ſenſe too? One would expect, the Author ſhould prove by Scripture, and not by Jewiſh Writers, that the Jewiſh High-Prieſt was a type of an High Prieſt, who is the eternal Son and Word of God. The Jewiſh High-Prieſt being a Type of Chriſt, was a Type of an High-Prieſt more eminent and greater than Himſelf in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, thô he were not God.</p>
               <p>He goes on. <q>For the Son of God is the only proper Mediator and Advocate with the Father.</q> If you ask him, why? he will anſwer; <q>
                     <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> who often calls the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <hi>Word</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> ſays ſo; and ſhows that the Garments of the High-Prieſt were Figures of Heaven and Earth. Which ſeems to ſignify that the eternal Word which made the World,</q> is the true High-Prieſt. Here comes upon the ſtage, one of his Learned Jews, <hi>Philo;</hi> by whoſe Teſtimony he proves, that the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity is the only proper Mediator and Advocate with the Father. But <hi>Philo</hi> being <hi>Plato</hi>'s Follower, did not believe ſuch a Trinity as the Doctor teaches. Sure there is a great difference between <hi>Plato</hi>'s three Principles, and the Doctor's Trinity. But if there were not; muſt we believe <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> rather than St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who plainly tells us (in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition to <hi>Philo)</hi> that as <hi>there is One God,</hi> ſo there is <hi>One Mediator between God and Men, the MAN Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. As for the Garments of the High-Prieſt, which <hi>Philo</hi> will have to be a Figure of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64942:10"/>
Heaven and Earth; and our Author's Story about <hi>Jaddus;</hi> both which our Author al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges as Arguments, at leaſt as Congruities, whereby to prove the Divinity of Chriſt; I ſhall ſo far truſt the Judgment of the meaneſt Reader, as to take no notice of them. That which follows, is no leſs ridiculous; <q>I am ſure (ſays the Author) the Apoſtle diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes Chriſt from <hi>High-Prieſts taken from among Men,</hi> and makes his Sonſhip the Foundation of his Prieſthood,</q> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 1, 6. The contrary to both theſe is true, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident alſo in the Text he cites. The Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is the Foundation of the Sonſhip; and <hi>Aaron</hi> and Chriſt are there made Inſtances of High-Prieſts taken from among Men. The Objection therefore remains ſtill; that Chriſt being an High-Prieſt appointed and <hi>made by God,</hi> cannot Himſelf be God.</p>
               <p>He goes on: <q>As for his next Objection (from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 23.) <hi>Chriſt is God's.</hi> I know not what he means by it; for there is no doubt but Chriſt is God's Son, God's Chriſt, God's High-Prieſt, ſerves the Ends and Deſigns of God's Glory; and what then? Therefore he is not God: by no means! he may conclude that He is not God the Father; becauſe He acta ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately; not that therefore He is not God the Son.</q> The Author of the <hi>Brief Hiſtory</hi> meant (I ſuppoſe) this; that as <hi>[you are Chriſt's]</hi> in that Text, ſignifies Men are ſubject to Chriſt; ſo <hi>[Chriſt is God's]</hi> muſt ſignify, Chriſt is ſubjected to God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not Himſelf God. This I think is good Sonſe, and a good Argument. But can it be ſaid, that the ſecond Perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who is the ſupream God; nay, One God with the Firſt, is God's Son, God's Chriſt, God's High Prieſt, ſerves the Ends and Deſigns of God's Glory? All theſe Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles denote a dependance upon the Father, and a real ſubjection to Him; which cannot agree to any Perſon who is indeed Himſelf a Supream God.</p>
               <p>Here is another ſenſleſs Anſwer, to a good and ſtrong Objection. <q>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 158. His next proof is; That God calls Chriſt his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> But it is his Servant <hi>in whom his Soul was pleaſed;</hi> which is the peculiar Character of his Son; and is that very Teſtimony which God gave to Chriſt at his Baptiſm, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
                  </q> I deſire here the Reader to obſerve the Doctor's accurate way of reaſoning. This is the Objection; Chriſt is called God's Servant, therefore He is not God. No, this is a miſtake, ſays He; for Chriſt is God's <hi>beloved</hi> Servant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 159. He ſays in anſwer to the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8, 9. <q>Becauſe He volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily condeſcends below the Dignity of his Nature; does He forfeit the Dignity of his Nature?</q> But I ask; can it be ſaid of the Supream God, <hi>with whom is no Variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neither Shadow of turning,</hi> that He has condeſcended below the Dignity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 159, 160. He goes on in a florid way of Speech to ſhow, how inconſiſtent it is that Chriſt, were He a meer Creature, ſhould be advanced to that Power and Authority, whereunto He has been promoted.</p>
               <p>Hereupon I obſerve; 1. The Dignity conferred upon Chriſt ought not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the Supream</hi> Government of the World; as this Author has ſtiled it: For He acts and governs in Subordination to his Father. 2. When the Scripture ſpeaks of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Chriſt, it extends it eſpecially over Angels and Men. 3. It is <hi>no Indignity</hi> to Angels, as our Author pretends, to be ruled and governed by a Man, whom God has exalted above them. Angels indeed have ſome natural Prerogatives above Men, whereby they are more excellent Creatures than Men: but if it pleaſes God of his free Gift, to inveſt a Man with greater Dignity, Power, and all other Excellence, than any Angel has; why can't He be ſet over them, as their Lord and Ruler, in Subordination to God? There is no Incongruity in it. 4. That, contrary to the Author's Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a meer Creature may be a fit Lieutenant or Repreſentative of God in Perſonal and Prerogative. Acts of Government or Power.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64942:10"/>
Thus <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were ſet over the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> to govern and rule over them by God's Appointment, in Subordination to him. Nay we do commonly ſay, That the King is the Lieutenant and Repreſentative of God. 5. God communicated to Chriſt ſuch Wiſdom and Power, as is neceſſary to enable him to exerciſe the Dignity conferred on him. In all this, there is not the leaſt <hi>Inconſiſtency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding his foregoing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, he confeſſes, the Difficulty remains. <hi>P.</hi> 161. <q>If He be by Nature the Son of God, and Natural Lord of the World; how is He ſaid to be exalted by God, and to receive a Kingdom from him, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Righteouſneſs and Sufferings? He was before poſſeſſed of it, ever ſince the Foundation of the World; being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Lord of all his Creatures: He had no need to receive that which was his own, or purchaſe what was his natural Right, by ſuch mean and vile Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as ſuffering Death on the Croſs.</q> Now to reconcile this, he makes a long Diſcourſe concerning <hi>the Mediatory Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt; which (ſaith he) hath been beſtowed on the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, and is peculiar to Him, and diſtinguiſhed from the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Government of the World, which He has in Conjunction with the Father. This Chimerical Syſtem I may overthrow, I think, by that ſingle Text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> already ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Men, the MAN Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If Chriſt is a Mediator, and has the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory Kingdom, as He is the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Trinity, that is, as He is God; why does the Apoſtle tell us, that He is a Mediator bearly as He is Man? At leaſt he ſhould have told us, that the Mediator is the <hi>God-Man</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. It is unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Apoſtle, who in all his Epiſtles ſets forth the Excellency and Glory of Chriſt, in the moſt expreſſive Terms; ſhould tell us that the MAN Chriſt Jeſus is the Mediator between God and Men, if the Mediatory Kingdom is exerciſed by the Divine Perſon or Nature, and if (not Chriſt <hi>Man,</hi> but) Chriſt God is the Mediator. But let us examine the Grounds our Author goes on.</p>
               <p>He tells us, <hi>ibid.</hi> 
                  <q>A Mediatory King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was neceſſary, to reconcile God and Men; to reſtore Man to the Integrity of his Nature: and this Power and Dignity God beſtowed on his own Son; who had the moſt Right to it, and was the beſt qualified for it, being <hi>the begotten Word and Wiſdom</hi> of the Father.</q> Now one would expect, he ſhould cite ſome Texts of Scripture, to prove this Aſſertion; but he could find no place to rely on. But Chriſt muſt, ſays he, firſt become Man, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the whole Will of God, and then He ſhall be exalted. Whereupon he makes this Obſervation; <hi>(pag.</hi> 162.) <q>All the Power Chriſt is inveſted with, is as Head of the Church:</q> 
                  <hi>God has put all Things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Feet; and given him to be Head over all Things to the Church; which is his Body, the Fulneſs of him that filleth all Things;</hi> 
                  <q>Eph. 1. 22, 23. That is, ſaith he, God has made him Governour of the World, as Head of the Church.</q> I obſerve two Things upon this place. 1. That this Text is not well interpreted. The firſt part of it relates to the foregoing Verſe, and ought to be explained by it: God, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, at Ver. 21. <hi>Set Chriſt at his own Right-Hand in the Heavenly Places, far above all Principality and Power, and every Name that is named, not only in this World, but in that which is to come.</hi> Ver. 23. <hi>And hath put all Things under his Feet.</hi> What Things? Thoſe that are before mentioned, all the Orders of Angels and all Earthly Powers. And then follows; <hi>And gave him to be Head,</hi> &amp;c. This is the ſenſe; not, that Chriſt was made Governour of the whole World, as Head of the Church. 2. But, what if all the Power Chriſt is inveſted with, is as Head of the Church? Will it not follow, that all the Power He is inveſted with, is as a Man, not as God? And this alſo I prove by <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>And He is the Head of the Body the Church, who is the Beginning, the Firſt-born from the Dead.</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:64942:11"/>
He who is the Firſt-born from the Dead, can be no other but the MAN Jeſus Chriſt; but He who is the Firſt-born from the Dead, is the Head of the Church, as that Text expreſly ſaith: therefore the MAN Chriſt Jeſus is the Head of the Church. Thus the Apoſtle very plainly telling us; that the Mediator and Head of the Church is the Man Chriſt Jeſus, deſtroys our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Notion of Chriſt's Mediatory King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or that it is grounded on and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by his Divine Nature or Perſon. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if Chriſt <hi>God</hi> is the Mediator, if the Mediatory Kingdom belongs to and is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by the ſecond Perſon of the (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) Trinity, I don't ſee, how the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Iſrael</hi> can be a Type of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as this Author ſays at <hi>p.</hi> 162, 163. For the King of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was between God and his People, and was really <hi>diverſe from both;</hi> but Chriſt in our Author's Hypotheſis, is God himſelf, <hi>One with the Father</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt; ſo that he muſt be a Mediator between himſelf and Men, which beſides that it is contrary to the Notion of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, does wholly deſtroy the Parallel.</p>
               <p>He ſays at <hi>pag.</hi> 164, 165. that, <q>We cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know from the Expoſitions of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that the Prophets ſpake of Chriſt under the Names of <hi>Lord, God,</hi> and <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
                  </q> But I deſire him, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile theſe Texts with his Opinion; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2. <hi>God, who at ſundry Times and in divers Manners, ſpake in times paſt to the Fathers by the Prophets; hath in theſe Laſt Days ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi> Heb. 2. 2, 3. <hi>For if the Word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt;—How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord?</hi> Gal. 3. 19. The Law <hi>was ordained by Angels, in the Hand of a Mediator,</hi> i. e. by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Acts 7. 53. <hi>Who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Law by the Diſpoſition of Angels.</hi> Ver. 38. <hi>This</hi> [Moſes] <hi>is He who was with the Church in the Wilderneſs, with the Angel who ſpake to him in Mount</hi> Sinai. Theſe Texts do more than ſufficiently prove, that the Son of God is not meant by the Prophets and other Writers of the Old Teſtament, where they mention <hi>the Lord, God,</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah.</hi> But to return to Chriſt's Mediatory Kingdom.</p>
               <p>He ſays <hi>pag.</hi> 167. <q>The Son has <hi>a Kingdom of his own,</hi> which is <hi>peculiarly his;</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in his Name, and by his Sovereign Authority.</q> But, how is this conſiſtent with what we read <hi>pag.</hi> 168. <q>The Power indeed whereby he adminiſters his Kingdom, is the Power of the whole Trinity, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: for they being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially one God, have but one Energy and Power, and therefore can never act ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.</q> How can the Son, or the ſecond Perſon of that Trinity, have <hi>a Kingdom of his own:</hi> if whatever he does, is alſo done by the Father and Holy Ghoſt; have not they hereby as great a ſhare in this Kingdom, as the Son? This therefore is a plain Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and perfect Non-ſenſe. Let us hear him further, <hi>pag.</hi> 169, 170. <q>The Power is not taken out of God's Hands, that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the World ſtill, by one individual Act and Power; but as in the Natural Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, the exerciſe of this Power begins with the Father; ſo in the exerciſe of this Mediatory Kingdom, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the Son, and is directed by his Mediation. That is, God governs the World now, not meerly as a Natural Lord, by the Rules of Natural Juſtice; but with reſpect to the Mediatory Power and Authority of his Son, and to ſerve the ends of his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory Kingdom.</q> This Chimerical reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not free the Author's Syſtem from Contradiction. For as in the Natural Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, tho (as he dreams) the exerciſe of the Power begins with the Father, yet the Son and Holy Spirit acting in conjunction with the Father, <hi>by an individual Act;</hi> it cannot be ſaid that the Power or Kingdom is peculiar to the Father: ſo in the ſuppoſed Mediatory Kingdom, tho the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Power begins with the Son; yet as long as the Father and Holy Spirit act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him, and can never act ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64942:11"/>
it cannot be ſaid, that <hi>the Son has a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his own,</hi> or that he is the Mediatory King, more than the Father or Spirit. Yet by the help of this contrived Mediatory King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, our Author undertakes (at <hi>pag.</hi> 173.) to overthrow the Fourth Argument in the Hiſtory of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians;</hi> even this, becauſe God doth all things in his own Name, and by his own Authority, but Chriſt comes in the Father's Name, does his Will, and ſeeks his Glory. <q>This only proves (ſays he) that he is not the Father but the Son, and the King of God. For this Mediatory Kingdom (as he ſays at <hi>pag.</hi> 172.) is erected by the Father;</q> and by him given to the Son. But I ask, is not the Son equal to the Father, both in Energy and Authority? How then can he be ſaid to be ſent by his Father, to receive his Commands, and to ſeek his Glory? Can all this be aſcribed to the Supream God? Nay, if the Father together with the Son and Spirit, be but one God; is it not abſurd to ſay that the Father ſends the Son, and the Son does the Will of the Father? Why not rather, in his own Mediatory Kingdom, does his own Will, ſeeks his own Glory? I think, I could as ſoon believe White is Black, as ſwallow the Abſurdities of our Author's Mediatory Kingdom. But 'tis plain to every diſcerning Reader, that he has often not underſtood what he ſaid.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſhown the Abſurdity of his Hypotheſis, concerning Chriſt's Mediatory Kingdom: I will ſet down in a few Words, what I take to be the true Notion of Chriſt's Kingdom. God had promiſed to <hi>David,</hi> that he would eſtabliſh his Throne for ever; and there ſhould never be wanting one of his Seed to ſit thereon; Pſal. 89. 3, 4. <hi>I have made a Covenant with my Choſen, I have ſworn unto</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>my Servant; thy Seed will I eſtabliſh for ever, and build up thy Throne to all Generations.</hi> And again, verſ. 29. <hi>His Seed will I make to indure for ever, and his Throne as the Days of Heaven.</hi> Again ver. 35, 36, 37. <hi>Once I have ſworn by my Holineſs, that I will not lie unto</hi> David: <hi>his Seed ſhall indure for ever, and his Throne as the Sun before me; it ſhall be eſtabliſht for ever as the Moon, and as a faithful Witneſs in the Heavens.</hi> Now that this Promiſe does not relate, only or chiefly, to <hi>David</hi>'s Succeſſors in the Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> without any reſpect to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who was alſo the Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> does plainly appear by the Event: for the Political Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed for ſeveral Ages, and the Series of Succeſſors in the <hi>Davidical</hi> Line is utterly broken off. This Promiſe therefore had its full Accompliſhment in our <hi>Meſſias</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and the King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But this Kingdom of Chriſt is both more ample and more durable than <hi>David</hi>'s was. For <hi>all Power is given to him, both in Heaven and Earth,</hi> Mat. 28. 18. And (1 Cor. 15. 25, 26.) <hi>He muſt reign, till he has put all Enemies under his Feet; the laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, is Death.</hi> Thus his Throne ſhall indure as long as the Sun and Moon. He may be called, with greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than <hi>David</hi> was (Pſal. 89. 27.) <hi>God's Firſt-born, Higher than the Kings of the Earth:</hi> for he is <hi>(Rev.</hi> 19. 16.) <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords;</hi> (Rev. 1. 5.) <hi>Prince of the Kings of the Earth.</hi> But his Power reaches not only over Men, but over Angels too; (1 Pet. 3. 22.) <hi>He is on the right hand of God, Angels, and Authorities, and Powers being made ſubject to him.</hi> This is God's Anointed, whom he has inveſted with the Power of enacting Laws for the good of his Subjects. When God did not ſo immediately govern <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as during the Theocracy, but by Kings; <hi>David,</hi> as God's Deputy and Vicegerent, appointed Muſick, Singers, Porters; and made ſuch other Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as were fit in the Worſhip of God: So Chriſt, who is a King immediately appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, by virtue of the Power <hi>and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions</hi> given to him, took away the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, ſet up a Spiritual Worſhip; and being a King over the Gentiles as well as over the Jews, made ſuch Laws as were able to unite them into one Body, in the Worſhip of one God; that there might be but one Flock, and one Shepherd. Chriſt's Kingdom is not only Spiritual, but Temporal; I mean, he has ſo much Power over all Creatures, as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64942:12"/>
is neceſſary to enable him, to perform the ends of his Spiritual Kingdom. Nor is this contradicted by our Saviour's Words, at <hi>John</hi> 18. 36. The Original has it not, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> but <hi>from</hi> this World. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. My Kingdom is not owing to Men, but to God's own appointment: I am a King indeed, but this Kingdom I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from God's own Hands: My Kingdom is <hi>not from hence,</hi> as he explains it, but from above. Acts 2. 36. <hi>God has made that ſame Jeſus, whom ye crucified, both Lord and Chriſt,</hi> i. e. <hi>King.</hi> And chap. 17. 31. <hi>He has appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Day, in which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs, by the MAN whom he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 24, 28, <hi>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father.—Then ſhall the Son be alſo ſubject to him, that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, I take to be the true account of Chriſt's Kingdom, according to Scripture. Thus God performed the Oath, which he ſware to <hi>David;</hi> even by <hi>raiſing up an Horn of Salvation in his Houſe,</hi> Luke 1. 69. Thus the Kingdom of Chriſt, who is the Seed of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> ſhall laſt as long as the Sun and Moon. But we no where find in Scripture, that this Kingdom is beſtowed upon him, as he is the Eternal Son of God, and Second Perſon of the Trinity. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo far from belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that; that diſcourſing of the principal Act of Chriſt's Kingly Power and Authority, <hi>viz.</hi> his judging the World; he ſays, that <hi>God</hi> has appointed a Day to perform this, by the MAN whom he has ordained, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. In a Word, as Chriſt has been exalted by God, and has received a Kingdom from him: So when the appointed End cometh, he ſhall deliver it up to God, and remain SUBJECT to him, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly teaches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. Theſe two things demonſtratively prove, that Chriſt is a King, barely as a Man; and that his Mediatory Kingdom, ſo much ſpoken of by our Author, is a Chimera.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to his other Anſwers, to this Objection, That Chriſt knows not the day of Judgment. <q>He replies <hi>(pag.</hi> 177.) Chriſt in that Text ſpeaks of himſelf as Man: St. <hi>Matthew</hi> does not mention <hi>the Son,</hi> which ſhews that the Son is included in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>None,</hi> or no Man; and therefore theſe Texts muſt ſpeak of Chriſt only as a Man.</q> I anſwer, ſo they do, for he is no more than a Man. St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, that Chriſt as <hi>the Son</hi> (of God) knows not that Day and Hour. Now our Author will have Chriſt's <hi>Sonſhip</hi> founded in his Eternal Generation from the Father; and that he is <hi>the Son</hi> not as he is Man, but as he is God, ſo he ſaith at <hi>pag.</hi> 166. and elſewhere. This is indeed a very eaſy diſtinction, were it but true: but <hi>Trinitarians</hi> are the Authors of it, not Scripture. In St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Gradation Chriſt is named after Men and Angels, to ſhew his preſent Excellence and Exaltation above them: but in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that very Son of God, who is above Men and Angels, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the <hi>None,</hi> or no Man. Thus this glorious Title of <hi>the Son</hi> of God, denotes here Chriſt <hi>Man.</hi> As <hi>the Father</hi> in St. <hi>Mark</hi> is God; ſo <hi>the Son</hi> of God, who knows not that Day and Hour, is Chriſt <hi>Man,</hi> who is ſo ſtiled in all the New Teſtament without any reſpect to a ſecond Nature.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p>THE ſixth Argument in the <hi>Brief Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> runs thus: <q>God giveth what, and to whom He pleaſes; He needs not the aid of any other; He intreateth not for Himſelf or his People; He cannot die; and deriveth his Power from none but Himſelf: But 'tis certain, that the Lord Chriſt could not himſelf, without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Ordination of the Father, confer the prime Dignities of Heaven, or of the Church. He placed his Safety in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Preſence and Help; he prayed often and fervently to the Father, both for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and for his Diſciples; he died, and was raiſed from the Dead by the Father; after his Reſurrection he received from another, all that great Power which he now injoys.</q> 
                  <q>To this he anſwers; Chriſt interceeds with no Creature, receives Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from no Creature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor from any God neither, who is ſeparated from himſelf: For he is One God with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Holy Ghoſt. That he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with the Father, proves indeed that he is a diſtinct Perſon from the Father; not,</q> that he is not one God with him. But why, I pray, does it not prove that, he is not one God with the Father? For if he intercedes with God, can he be that very God with whom he intercedes? if he is, what need is there for him to intercede? Beſides; this Author ſays before <hi>(pag.</hi> 167, 169, 170.) <hi>The Three Divine Perſons can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver act ſeparately, they have but One Energy,</hi> and whatever is done they do it <hi>by one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Act.</hi> Now I hope he will grant, that Prayer and Interceſſion are real Acts or Actions: I infer, therefore when the Son intercedes, the Father and Holy Spirit muſt intercede too. Thus Interceſſion and Prayer are not peculiar to the Son; but there are in the Godhead three Interceſſors, three Beſeeching Perſons. Whom, what Perſon or God, does this Trinity beſeech? Good God! how long ſhall it be, that Men will love Darkneſs rather than Light; and prefer a Novel and Unintelligible Goſpel, before the old, plain and eaſy One?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 183. He ſays; <q>For God to make a Creature, Advocate and Mediator, is to give a Creature Authority over himſelf; which cannot be: for it is a Debaſement to the Divine Nature, and a reproach to the Divine Wiſdom; it is as if God did not better know, how to diſpoſe of his Grace and Mercy,</q> than any Creature does. But why ſo? has our Author forgot, or is he to learn, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> thô a meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was a Mediator between God and his People? I am ſure, St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls him ſo in theſe Words, at <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>The Law was ordained by Angels, in the Hand of a Mediator.</hi> And at <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>He ſtood between the Lord and them, to ſhew them the Word of the Lord.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle tells us, that the MAN Jeſus Chriſt is a Mediator between God and Men. Does not the Scripture mention <hi>Moſes</hi> his Interceſſion with God; and that God was moved by his Intreaty? Why then does this Author affirm; that <hi>to intercede with the Authority of a Mediator, is above the Nature and Order of Creatures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the next Argument; <hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt is in Holy Scripture always ſpoken of, as a diſtinct and different Perſon from God; and deſcribed to be the Son of God, and the Image of God. He anſwers, <q>This we own, and he had no need to prove it: This is a wonderful Argument to convince thoſe, who acknowledg Three diſtinct Perſons in the Godhead; that Chriſt is not God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a diſtinct Perſon from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64942:13"/>
for ſo according to the Language of Scripture, <hi>God</hi> ſignifies <hi>God the Father,</hi> when he is diſtinguiſhed from the Son and Holy Spirit;</q> as all Men grant. Let the Author abate a little of his Confidence. Is an Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Anſwer ſufficient, to confute a good and a ſtrong Argument? This is <hi>a wonderful Argument,</hi> ſays he, to prove that Chriſt is not God. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in his Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, <hi>Grace be to you, and Peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> who would gueſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is God as well as the Father? he, nor any other ſacred Writer ever ſays, that there are Three Perſons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; he calls only the Father, <hi>God,</hi> and diſtinguiſhes the Lord Chriſt from him. If the Lord Chriſt is God as well as the Father, the Apoſtle ſhould have framed his Salutation thus; <hi>Grace be to you, and Peace from God the Father; and from the God Man Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But according to the Language of Scripture, ſays he, <hi>God</hi> ſignifies <hi>God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> when he is diſtinguiſhed from the Son and Holy Spirit. I anſwer; that is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that the Father only is God; elſe the Title <hi>God</hi> could not be appropriated to him, when he is diſtinguiſhed from the Son and Spirit. And to diſcern ſo much, a Man can lack nothing but common Senſe. But I obſerve farther to this Anſwer; that ſuppoſing Chriſt were but a Man, the Apoſtle could have expreſſed himſelf no otherways; from whence it follows, that either the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did indeed ſo think, and ſo teach; or this Author muſt charge him, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to ſpeak correctly and properly.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>'Tis impoſſible, ſaith the <hi>Brief Hiſtory,</hi> that the Son or Image of the One true God, ſhould himſelf be that One true God; as impoſſible as that the Son ſhould be the Father, or the Image that very Thing whoſe Image it is.</q> 
                  <q>This is meer Sophiſtry, ſaith our Author; for if the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghoſt be the One true God; they are the ſame One true God, and yet the Father is not the Son,</q> nor the Son the Father. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Reader, whether this be not a mear denial of the Difficulty, not an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication or a Solution of it? The Son, ſaith the Hiſtorian, can't be the One true God, becauſe he is the Son and Image of the One true God; for the Son cannot be the Father, nor the Image the very Thing whoſe Image it is. Yes, ſays our Anſwerer, God and the Image of God <hi>are the ſame One true God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Argument of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> is, that <q>Many Texts expreſly declare, That only the Father is God.</q> In anſwer to this, ſays our Author: <q>This would be a Demonſtration, could he produce any one Text which aſſerts, that only the Father, in oppoſition to the Son and Holy Ghoſt, is God: for then the Father muſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Perſon of the Father, in oppoſition to the Perſon of the Son, and the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt.</q> But has not the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian produced ſuch a Text? <hi>John</hi> 17. 3. <hi>Father,—this is Life Eternal, to know Thee [the ONLY true God] and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> Or, Jeſus Chriſt thy Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Here, <hi>the Father,</hi> to whom the Son directs his Prayer (as appears by Ver. 1.) is called <hi>the only true God;</hi> and the Son, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt <hi>whom he hath ſent,</hi> or his Meſſenger. Here the Father as the Sender, <hi>is oppoſed</hi> to the Son as the Meſſenger; and the Firſt called the ONLY true God, the Other an Apoſtle or Meſſenger. Our Author adds; <q>But when the Father is called the only true God, only in oppoſition to all the falſe Gods, which the World then worſhipped; there <hi>Father</hi> does not ſignify <hi>Perſonally,</hi> but that one Godhead or Divinity, of which the Father is the Source, the Fountain and the Original.</q> So ſoon has this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor forgot his own Obſervation and Rule of Interpretation, that, <hi>according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God ſignifies God the Father, whenever he is diſtinguiſhed from the Son or Spirit.</hi> Is not he, to whom Chriſt here directs his Prayer, called <hi>God?</hi> and is he not diſtinguiſhed from the Son, who is called <hi>the Meſſenger?</hi> why then ſhould he not ſignify here <hi>Perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:64942:13"/>
God the Father, as well as in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? why muſt <hi>Father</hi> here ſignify, <hi>not the Father; but one Godhead, of which the Father is the Source?</hi> Thus either his Obſervation is falſe; and then he is overthrown by the Texts to which he oppoſes it: or it is true; and then in this Text, <hi>the only true God</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by our Saviour himſelf to be <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only,</hi> in oppoſition to all other Perſons whomſoever. I cannot but admire this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's way of expounding Scripture. One while, he founds Chriſt's Sonſhip on his eternal Generation; ſo that the title <hi>Son</hi> denotes <hi>begotten Wiſdom</hi> the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity: as ſoon as this notion will not ſerve the turn; as when the Son is (in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark)</hi> denied to know the Day and Hour of Judgment; then <hi>the Son</hi> ſhall ſignify Chriſt <hi>Man.</hi> Again, when God is diſtinguiſhed from the Son and Holy Spirit, he ſignifies <hi>Perſonally</hi> God the Father; this Notion ſhall ſerve us againſt many So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian ſayings of Scripture, againſt all the Texts in the ſeventh Argument of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But when <hi>John</hi> 17. 1, 3. and the like Texts are urged; then on the contrary, God the Father muſt not ſignify the Father Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, but one Godhead, or Divinity, of which the Father is the Source. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were his Hypotheſis true, there would be no need he ſhould thus turn himſelf into all Shapes to defend it.</p>
               <p>When the Father is called, <hi>the one God,</hi> and <hi>the only true God;</hi> in oppoſition to all falſe Gods: is he not ſo called in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Son alſo? Moſt certainly he is. In theſe two Texts, <hi>John</hi> 17. 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. we have no warrant from Reaſon or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to underſtand by <hi>the Father</hi> Three Perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. Is it not abſurd and ſenſeleſs to ſay, That <hi>the Father</hi> ſignifies alſo the Son and Holy Ghoſt, in thoſe very Texts where he is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from them? I always thought <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſignified, the Father only; and <hi>the Son,</hi> the Son only, and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt only. I always thought that the Language of Scripture, was agreeable to the Language of Men; becauſe otherways it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by Men: and therefore that <hi>Father</hi> muſt not be underſtood to be Father and Son, and a third Perſon diſtinct from both. But Trinitarians, better ſighted than other People, have found, it may. When we read in Scripture, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6.) <hi>To us there is but one God, the Father:</hi> It ſounds as if the Apoſtle had ſaid; There is but one nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical infinite Being, the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, and of all the World; becauſe this is the natural Idea we have of <hi>one God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> But this Author tells us, we are groſly miſtaken; for <hi>one God</hi> ſignifies three infinite Minds, three ſubſtantial intellectual Beings or Perſons. Again, we ſhould think that <hi>the Father</hi> here ſignifies <hi>the Father only:</hi> but this is (it ſeems) another foul Miſtake; for it ſignifies beſides the Father, a Son and an Holy Spirit different from both. Nay, we muſt not think that the very expreſs Words (at <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 36.) <hi>the Father only,</hi> do indeed ſignify the Father only; but the Father, the Son, and another Perſon; even thô the Son is there expreſly ſaid not to know the Day and Hour of Judgment, and that <hi>the Father only</hi> knows it. Theſe are ſome of the Illuminations with which our Author and his Party has bleſt the World.</p>
               <p>He goes on, and ſays; the Diſpute muſt end here, whether the Scripture does teach the Divinity of the Son and Holy Ghoſt; for if ſo, when the Father is ſaid to be <hi>the only true God,</hi> and <hi>the one God;</hi> the Son and Holy Spirit are not hereby excluded from the Unity of the ſame Godhead. I anſwer, the Diſpute may be ſoon ended; for when the Father is called the one God, and the only true God, even in thoſe places where the Son is mentioned: This alone is a clear Demonſtration, that the Scripture does not teach the Divinity of the Son and Holy Ghoſt. Were the Son and Holy Ghoſt God with the Father, the Prayer of our Lord (at <hi>John</hi> 17. 1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> muſt have been thus framed; <q>This is Life Eternal, to know Thee (Father) <hi>and Me and the Holy Ghoſt</hi> to be the only true God.</q> And <hi>Paul</hi> to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64942:14"/>
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſhould have ſaid; <q>But to us there is but one God, the Father, <hi>the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </q> But this is the Language of Scripture, no where.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 186. <q>His other Texts, ſaith our Author, prove no more but that the Father of Chriſt is God; not, that Chriſt is not one God with the Father.</q> Let us hear the Texts themſelves, 1 Cor. 15. 24. <hi>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father.</hi> James 3. 9. <hi>Therewith bleſs we God, even the Father.</hi> Rom. 15. 6. <hi>That ye may with one Mind, and one Mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> It is an affected blindneſs and perverſeneſs, not to diſcern and own, that in theſe Texts, <hi>God even the Father,</hi> is as much as to ſay, <hi>God, that is to ſay the Father.</hi> No plainer or more expreſs Words could be uſed by a <hi>Socinian</hi> or other <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian,</hi> to declare his Notion of the Unity of God. What hope is there of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing thoſe, with whom <hi>the Father only</hi> ſhall not ſignify the Father only? And again, <hi>God, that is to ſay the Father,</hi> ſhall be two others beſides the Father.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>THE next Argument. <q>If Chriſt were indeed God as well as Man; or (as <hi>Trinitarians</hi> ſpeak) <hi>God the Son</hi> Incarnate; it had been altogether ſuperfluous, to give the Holy Spirit to his ſaid Human Nature, as a Director and Guide: for what other help could that Nature need, which was one Perſon with (as they ſpeak) <hi>God the Son;</hi> and in which God the Son did Perſonally dwell?</q> To this he anſwers: <q>The account of this is plain and ſhort; for the whole Trinity is but one Energy and Power, and the Divine Perſons cannot act ſeparately <hi>ad extra:</hi> what the Father does, that the Son does, and that the Holy Ghoſt does by one Individual Act. But the Sanctification of all Creatures (and ſuch is the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt) is peculiarly attributed to the Holy Spirit.</q> But if the whole Trinity is but one Energy and Power, the Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's Human Nature (or of any other Creature) can by no means be peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributed to the Holy Ghoſt; why to the Holy Ghoſt rather than to the Father, or than to the Divine Word, or Son dwelling (as they ſay) after a peculiar manner in Chriſt? But the matter is plain, the Holy Ghoſt is the Power of God, of which Chriſt ſtood in need, for performing the Will and Works of the Father, and which God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him for that very end; but if Chriſt had been indeed God, there had been no need he ſhould receive any ſuch Gift; for as God he would have had it, <hi>in his own Perſon.</hi> Our Author adds, <q>He might as well have asked, why the Sanctification of the Church is aſcribed to the Spirit?</q> But the Hiſtorian had no reaſon to ask ſuch a Queſtion: for no one pretends that the Church is God; or is Perſonally united either to the Father or Son, as <hi>Trinitarians</hi> ſay the Human Nature of Chriſt is.</p>
               <p>It is after the ſame ſlight and inſignificant manner, that he anſwers the next Argument, even this; <q>The Miracles of Chriſt are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed always, either to the Father, or the Holy Spirit dwelling in him.</q> He anſwers <hi>(pag.</hi> 188.) <hi>Father, Son and Holy Spirit act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> I ſay now, ſuppoſing this which he ſays; yet if Chriſt were God, why ſhould we never aſcribe his Miracles to himſelf; why <hi>always</hi> to the Father, or to the Holy Spirit which is the Power of the Father? why has he concealed a matter of ſo great importance to be known? Or why do we ſeek to make him greater than he ever ſaid he was? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64942:14"/>
in the very Texts, in which he aſcribes the Miracles he did, to the Father, or the Spirit and Power of the Father dwelling in him; I ſay in thoſe very Texts he denies, that he doth them himſelf: which is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what our Author affirms, that the (pretended) three Divine Perſons have but one Energy, and act by one Individual Act. If that were ſo, our Saviour could not have ſaid, John 5. 30. <hi>I can do nothing of my ſelf.</hi> John 14. 10. <hi>The Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.</hi> Let us hear the account which St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives, Acts 10. 38. <hi>God anointed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppreſſed with the Devil: for God was with him.</hi> Here St. <hi>Peter</hi> teaches, that Chriſt wrought all ſorts of Miracles, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as <hi>Trinitarians</hi> ſay) he was God, but <hi>becauſe God was with him,</hi> i. e. God helped and aſſiſted him, by anointing him with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Power.</p>
               <p>The next Argument is, <q>Had our Lord Chriſt been more than a Man, the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Old Teſtament in which he is promiſed, would not deſcribe him barely as <hi>the Seed of the Woman, the Seed of Abraham,</hi> a Prophet like unto <hi>Moſes;</hi> the Servant and Miſſionary of God, on whom God's Spirit ſhould reſt.</q> The Hiſtorian by a particular Induction of Texts, ſhews this to be the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Chriſt in the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament. Our Author thinks fit to anſwer this Objection, in another place.</p>
               <p>I come now to his Anſwers, which he makes to the Arguments againſt the Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Argument in the Hiſtory, is this; <q>The Holy Ghoſt or Spirit, and the Power of God, are in Scripture ſpoken of as one and the ſame thing.</q> Our Author anſwers, at <hi>pag.</hi> 189. <q>It is as eaſy to prove, that the Father and Son are no Perſons, as that the Holy Spirit is none.</q> But if he can make good this Aſſertion, <hi>erit mihi magnus Apollo.</hi> The Father has in the New Teſtament the Title of God, therefore becauſe God is moſt certainly a Perſon, no Body can doubt that the Father is a Perſon. As for the Son, the ſame Goſpel often ſays he is a Man; every Man being a Perſon; the Son being a Man, muſt be alſo a Perſon. But it is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with the Holy Ghoſt, for the Scriptures call it <hi>the Power</hi> of God; and Power is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, not a Perſon. Acts 10. 38. <hi>God has anointed Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Power.</hi> Luke 1. 35. <hi>The Holy Ghost ſhall come upon thee, and the Power of the Highest ſhall overſhadow thee.</hi> What is more plain than that, <hi>the Power of the Highest</hi> in theſe Texts is the explication of <hi>the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> Again, Acts 6. 5. <hi>They choſe</hi> Stephen, <hi>a Man full of Faith, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>And</hi> Stephen <hi>full of Faith and of POWER, did great Wonders.</hi> Here again the Holy Ghoſt at <hi>ver.</hi> 5. is explained by Power at <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>He ſays further; <q>He is the Spirit of God, which ſearcheth the deep things of God; and he who knows all things in God, muſt be a knowing Mind.</q> In anſwer to this, I muſt explain the Text to which he alludes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11. and which he cites too, <hi>pag.</hi> 192. Ver. 10. <hi>But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit; for the Spirit ſearches all things, yea the deep things of God.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks here of <hi>the Doctrines of the Goſpel,</hi> its Precepts and Promiſes, which before were hidden, but now are revealed to Men; as appears by <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9. He meaneth this; <q>God has revealed to us Apoſtles theſe Doctrines, this (formerly) hidden Wiſdom, <hi>by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration;</hi> for this Spirit or Inſpiration in us ſearcheth out <hi>(i. e.</hi> finds or diſcovers) theſe deep or hidden things of God. Deep, I ſay, and hidden; not to us, but to the World,</q> and the Princes of the World. The Apoſtle illuſtrates his Diſcourſe with a Compariſon, ver. 11. <hi>What Man knoweth the things of a Man, ſave the Spirit of a Man which is in him? Even ſo the Things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> As if he had ſaid, As <hi>no Man</hi> knows the things that belong to Human Life, but by his own Spirit or Mind: So <hi>no Man</hi> knows theſe things of God, but by God's Spirit or Inſpiration, whereby he is enabled to know them. This Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64942:15"/>
perfectly agrees with what follows, at ver. 12. <hi>Now we have not received the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the true Senſe of this place. For <gap reason="foreign">

The Author grants, that Charity may be ſaid <hi>to ſuffer long, and to be kind,</hi> becauſe a charitable Man does ſo: then the Spirit of God may be ſaid <hi>to know the Things of God,</hi> becauſe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>He that is Spiritual</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles him, Ver. 15.) he that has the Spirit of God, does ſo.

                  </q> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>is Spirit.</hi> This I hope may be enough to clear the ſenſe of this Text.</p>
               <p>But the Author cannot allow of Power and Inſpiration, diſtinct from God, and yet not God; <hi>for what are Faculties in us, are Perſons in God.</hi> If this be true, then there are more than Three Perſons in the Godhead; for <hi>Power</hi> is a Faculty in us, and being in God too, it muſt be another Perſon in him. Thus not only Wiſdom and Love, but Power alſo are Perſons in God. Nay, there being Three knowing Minds in the Godhead, each of which is `God, as the Author tells us; it cannot be ſaid, that the Father only has Wiſdom, Love, and Power. The Son and the Holy Ghoſt muſt have them too; elſe they ſhould not be God. But if Wiſdom, Love and Power, being Faculties in us, ought to be Perſons in God: then there are Nine Perſons at the leaſt, in God, <hi>viz.</hi> Wiſdom, Love and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Father, who is an Infinite Mind diſtinct from the Son and Holy Ghoſt; Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Love and Power in the Son, who is an Infinite Mind diſtinguiſhed from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Holy Ghoſt; Wiſdom, Love and Power in the Holy Ghoſt, who is an Infinite Mind diſtinct from the Father and Son. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he tells us, that the Son is a Perſon, <hi>becauſe He is the Father's Reflex knowledge.</hi> But the Son being an Infinite and moſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Mind, is undoubtedly able to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Wiſdom and Knowledg, and thus (as well as the Father) to beget a Son. And this ſecond Son in the Trinity may by the ſame Means and Reaſon beget another, and ſo onwards to Infinity. Thus according to this Maxim, that <hi>what are Faculties in us, are Perſons in God;</hi> there may be, nay there muſt be, an infinite number of Perſons in God. <hi>Apage!</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>This is certain (ſays he) all Perſonal Acts belong to a Perſon; and therefore whatever has any Perſonal Acts, we muſt conclude is a Perſon: unleſs we know by ſome other means, that it is no Perſon; and then, that proves the Expreſſion to be Figurative.</q> But we know, that the Holy Ghoſt is no Perſon; and therefore we may affirm, that whenever Perſonal Acts are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to it, it is to be figuratively taken. That the Holy Ghoſt is not God, we moſt certainly know; becauſe the Scripture plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells us, there is but one God, <hi>the Father.</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt is not <hi>a created</hi> Perſon, is made probable by ſeveral places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which teach us, that it is God's Power and Inſpiration; <hi>by explaining the Holy Ghoſt by the Power of God,</hi> and putting one for the other. According to theſe two Principles, which the Scripture affords us; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Father only is God, and that the Holy Ghoſt is God's Power; we dare affirm, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64942:15"/>
when Perſonal Acts are aſcribed to it, it is a Figurative Expreſſion. Thus we can eaſily conceive, that the Holy Ghoſt may be ſaid <hi>to work Miracles</hi> (pag. 190.) <hi>to raiſe the Dead, to comfort, to convince, to ſanctify the Church, to dwell in the Church:</hi> becauſe God by his Power works Miracles, raiſes the Dead, comforts, convinces, ſanctifies, and dwells in the Church. Thus we do not <hi>prove</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt is no Perſon, <hi>only becauſe Perſonal Acts are ſometimes Figuratively attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to that which is no Perſon; as this Author miſtakes:</hi> But having proved by Scripture, that the Holy Ghoſt is no Perſon, we ſay that Perſonal Acts are figuratively aſcribed to it, as they are to Charity, Wiſdom, and other Things, both in Scripture and in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Authors, and in common familiar Speech.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Argument, againſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's being God, is this; <q>A manifeſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is made, as between God and Chriſt; ſo alſo between God and the Holy Spirit, or Power and Inſpiration of God: ſo that 'tis impoſſible, the Spirit ſhould be God himſelf.</q> To this our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor anſwers, <hi>pag.</hi> 191. <q>This Holy Spirit is either a Divine ſubſiſting Perſon, or nothing but a Name. If this Spirit were a Divine Virtue or Power (as he would have it) then it is not diſtinct from God, but is God himſelf: As the Powers and Faculties of the Mind, thô they may be diſtinguiſhed from each other, yet they can't be any thing diſtinct from the Mind, but are the Mind it ſelf; and therefore if the Spirit, as he ſays, be repreſented in Scripture, as ſo diſtinct from God, that 'tis impoſſible he ſhould be God himſelf; then he muſt be a diſtinct Divine Perſon, and not the meer Power of God, which is not diſtinct from God himſelf.</q> To this I anſwer; the Holy Spirit is neither a Divine ſubſiſting Perſon, nor a meer Name. In order to the clearing of this, I muſt obſerve, that the Holy Ghoſt ſignifies in Scripture, ſometimes the Power of God, ſometimes the Effects of that Power, or all miraculous extraordinary Gifts. In the firſt ſenſe, we read <hi>(Luke</hi> 1. 35.) <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the Power of the Higheſt ſhall over-ſhadow thee.</hi> Here it is evident that the Holy Ghoſt ſignifies the Power of God; whereby he effected the miraculous Conception of our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. In the latter ſenſe, we read <hi>(Gal.</hi> 3. 5.) <hi>He therefore that miniſtreth to you the Spirit, and worketh Miracles among you; doth he it by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> Here the Spirit is plainly meant of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gifts, beſtowed upon the firſt Chriſtians; and the meaning of the Apoſtle's Queſtion is this; whether the <hi>Galatians</hi> had been indued with that Spirit, and thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gifts, by ſubmitting to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or only upon their imbracing the Goſpel? In the firſt ſenſe, the Holy Ghoſt is only <hi>an Attribute</hi> of God, and ſo is <hi>not a meer Name;</hi> nor is it a Divine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Perſon; which to ſay, were ridiculous, and contrary to the Notion of an Attribute. This Attribute may be diſtinguiſh'd from God, in ſuch manner <hi>as Attributes are wont to be diſtinguiſh'd;</hi> that is, God may be ſaid to act by his Power, as he is ſaid to act by his Wiſdom. But he ſaith, <hi>If this Spirit were a Divine Vertue or Power, then it is not diſtinct from God, but is God himſelf.</hi> I anſwer, if this be all our Author contends for, that the Holy Spirit (or Power) of God is God, in ſuch ſenſe as other Vertues and Faculties of God may be called God himſelf; the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> never denied it: and this is all that his Argument proves. Secondly, He ought to know, the Holy Spirit is not diſtinct from God, as one Perſon from another, but is diſtinguiſhed from God <hi>as his Attribute.</hi> This is eaſy and plain, and agreeable to Reaſon and Scripture: and is a full anſwer to what he adds, in theſe words; <q>A Power which is diſtinct from God, and is not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as (he ſays) the Holy Spirit is, if it has any Perſonal Acts, muſt be a diſtinct Perſon: and if theſe Perſonal Acts are ſuch, as are proper only to God, it muſt be a diſtinct Divine Perſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:64942:16"/>
He goes on. <q>He ſays this Spirit is the Inſpiration of God; be it ſo. This Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then, is either within God himſelf; or without him, in his Creatures who have this Inſpiration. If it be within God himſelf, it muſt be a Perſon, or elſe it cannot be diſtinct from God; and a Divine Perſon, unleſs any thing be in God, which is not God. If this Inſpiration be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, in the Creatures who are inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him; how is it the Spirit of God? For the Spirit of God muſt be in God, as the Spirit of a Man is in a Man? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If every thing that is in God be a Perſon, then there muſt be as many Perſons in the Godhead, as there are <hi>Attributes</hi> or <hi>Immanent Acts</hi> in God; which to ſay, is too ſenſleſs and ridiculous, to need Confutation. God's Inſpiration as 'tis an Act, is in God; as 'tis an Effect, 'tis in Creatures; and is called the Spirit of God, becauſe 'tis an Effect of that Spirit, Energy or Power, which God uſes to make his Will known to Men, by inward Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion or Inſpiration.</p>
               <p>He deſires to know <hi>(pag.</hi> 192.) how the Spirit of God differs from his Gifts and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? I anſwer; As the cauſe from its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: ſo that <hi>there are Diverſities of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 4. The ſame Cauſe produces ſeveral effects, out of the ſame Power ſpring ſeveral Gifts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next Argument is; <q>The Spirit is obtained of God by our Prayers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſelf is not God.</q> This he pretends to anſwer by his Old Sophiſm, that One Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon may ſend and give another; which has been already confuted. He adds; <q>The Spirit gives himſelf, and is asked of himſelf; for the Divine Perſons in the Trinity do not act ſeparately: but as the Father and the Son give the Spirit; ſo the Holy Spirit gives himſelf <hi>in the ſame Individual Act.</hi>
                  </q> But how can this be the ſame Individual Act? The Father and the Son, ſays he, ſend the Holy Ghoſt, and the Holy Ghoſt gives himſelf. Can <hi>ſending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> and <hi>giving one's ſelf,</hi> be one and the ſame Act? Farther; If the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt cannot act ſeparately, when the Holy Ghoſt gives himſelf, Father and Son muſt give themſelves too; or elſe it will not be <hi>the ſame Individual Act.</hi> But were it ſo; this would not be made peculiar to the Holy Ghoſt, who only is ſaid (in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) to be given and obtained of God. But the thing is plain and eaſy, if by the Spirit we underſtand God's Power and Inſpiration; which (with their Effects) are communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thoſe that pray for them.</p>

               <p n="4">4. THE next Argument is againſt a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Perſons in the Godhead; <q>Which (ſaith the Hiſtorian) is contrary to the whole Scripture. For that ſpeaks of God, but <hi>as one Perſon;</hi> and ſpeaks of him, and to him <hi>by Singular Pronouns;</hi> ſuch as <hi>I,</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>Thou, Me, Him,</hi> &amp;c. He cites alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. where Chriſt is called, the expreſs Image of God's Perſon. Our Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns this Anſwer; <q>It is plain that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of whom the Son is called the expreſs Image, is the Perſon of God the Father; and the Father indeed is but one Perſon.</q> But here he takes for granted, that the Son is the ſecond Perſon, of the Trinity; contrary to the Apoſtle, who ſpeaks only of <hi>the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God,</hi> not of the Perſon of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtinct from the Perſon of God the Son. If the Perſon, of whom the Son is here ſaid to be the expreſs Image, is only the Perſon of the Father; then the Perſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only, <hi>at ſundry Times and in divers Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> ſpake in times paſt to the Fathers by the Prophets, Ver. 1. for (Ver. 2.) the Son is called the Image of the ſame Perſon who ſpake to the Fathers at Ver. 1. But the Perſon of the Father only, is not the true God, in the Author's Hypotheſis; therefore he muſt conclude, that the true God ſpake not to the Fathers: which is a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Apoſtle; who ſays, that God (undoubtedly the true God) ſpake to the Fathers. Farther, by <hi>God who ſpake to the Fathers,</hi> we muſt underſtand either Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, or the Father only. If Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt ſpake to the Fathers; it could not be here ſaid, that Chriſt is the Image of that God's <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> for he is Three Perſons. If the Father only ſpake to the Fathers, then <hi>the Father only</hi> is the true God; for the true God ſpake to the Fathers; alſo then God is but one Perſon: Which are the things we contend for.</p>
               <p>He goes on; <q>As for his <hi>Singular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouns, I, Thou,</hi> &amp;c. They prove indeed that there is but one God; as we all own: not, that there are not Three Perſons in the Godhead.</q> But do not <hi>Singular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouns</hi> denote <hi>Singular Perſons,</hi> in all Languages? When therefore they are applied to God, they ſhow that he is a Singular (that is, but one) Perſon; unleſs they will ſay, that the Scripture is a particular Language different from all others: but this is falſe; for being written to Men, the Forms of ſpeaking and the Senſes of them, are the ſame as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Languages; and otherways the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would not be given us, to inſtruct us, but to pervert and deceive us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth Argument. <q>Had the Son or Holy Ghoſt been God; this would not have been omitted in the Apoſtles Creed.</q> He anſwers; <q>Had not the Son been God, and alſo the Holy Ghoſt, they would never have been put into the Apoſtles Creed; no more than the Form of Baptiſm, which is the Original of the Apoſtles Creed.</q> But why not? Suppoſe the Son and Holy Ghoſt were not God; ſince <hi>the Goſpel was preached by the One,</hi> and <hi>confirmed by the Other;</hi> why may not they be put into the Creed, as well as <hi>the Catholic Church,</hi> by whom <hi>the Goſpel is to be believed?</hi> If our Creed only mentioned God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; it would fit a Jew as well as a Chriſtian: therefore a Chriſtian Creed, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> muſt make mention of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt, thô they are not Gods or God. A Chriſtian, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> muſt profeſs in his Creed, that he believes not only in God the Father Almighty; but alſo in his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64942:17"/>
Son Jeſus Chriſt, who was ſent by him to preach the Goſpel; and in the Holy Ghoſt, by which it pleaſed God to confirm the truth of it: By ſuch a Belief he is diſtinguiſhed from a Jew or any other Man.</p>
               <p>He adds. <q>That the Primitive Chriſtians did believe the Divinity of the Son and Holy Ghoſt, we are ſufficiently aſſured from all the <hi>Antient Records</hi> of their Faith; but there was <hi>no Reaſon</hi> to expreſs this in <hi>ſo ſhort</hi> a Creed, before the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Hereſies had diſturbed the Church.</q> 'Tis plain, our Author has not read the Records of which he ſpeaks. And whereas he ſays, there was <hi>no reaſon</hi> to expreſs the Doctrine of the Trinity in the Creed; 'tis very marvellous to me, that there ſhould be no reaſon to expreſs an Article, which he and his Party ſay <hi>is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation;</hi> and that a Man is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that believes it not. But he ſaith it was not neceſſary in <hi>ſo ſhort</hi> a Creed; but I ſay, had the Article been neceſſary, (or ſo much as true) the Apoſtles and Primitive Church would have inlarged their Creed, to make room for a neceſſary Article; an Article much more neceſſary than the <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> and other Articles there expreſſed. Beſides, what Inlargement would it have been, what Incumbrance to the Learner's Memory, to have added twice this ſingle and ſhort Word, <hi>God: And in (God)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Son, Jeſus Christ our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I believe in (God) the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Trinitarians</hi> expreſs themſelves now a days? It is plain therefore, that the Apoſtles and Antient Church could have no other Reaſon, why in their Creed they made no mention of the Trinity, and the Divinity of the Son and Holy Ghoſt; no other, but that they believed it not. But why has our Author taken no notice of what the <hi>Socinian</hi> Hiſtorian had objected at <hi>pag.</hi> 22, 23, 24. was it too hot, or to heavy for him? Laſtly; he ſays, <hi>It needed not to be added; becauſe the Son of God muſt be by Nature God; and the Spirit of God is as eſſentially God, as the Spirit of a Man is eſſential to a Man.</hi> But muſt he that is the Son of God, be alſo by Nature God? St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays of <hi>Adam, who was the Son of God, Luke</hi> 1. 38. Was <hi>Adam</hi> by nature God? Are not Angels in Scripture called <hi>Sons of God?</hi> and all good Chriſtians are they not alſo Sons of God, in the Language of Scripture? <hi>Job</hi> 1. 6. and 38. 7. <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 2. For his other ſaying, that <hi>the Spirit of God is as eſſentially God, as the Spirit of a Man is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to a Man:</hi> If one had leiſure, there might be Anſwers enow made to it; all that I ſay, is, <hi>I pray prove it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Hiſtorian concludes, That, <q>The <hi>Socinian</hi> Faith is an accountable and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Faith; but that of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> is abſurd, and contrary both to Reaſon, and to it ſelf, and therefore not only falſe, but <hi>impoſſible.</hi>
                  </q> On the contrary, our Author draws up againſt the <hi>Socinian</hi> Syſtem this Charge. <q>1. It ridicules the Scriptures. 2.

               <p n="1">1. THE Firſt pretence is, <q>That The <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine ridicules the Scripture, by putting either a very abſurd or a very trifling Senſe on it, unworthy of the Wiſdom of God by whom it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired.</q> He inſtances in ſome Expoſitions of Scripture, which he finds in the brief Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi> For Example,</p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian, in anſwer to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 6, 7. which the Apoſtle (at <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8.) applies to Chriſt, ſays, <q>In the Hebrew and in the Greek 'tis, <hi>God is thy Throne</hi> (i. e. thy Seat, Reſting-place,</q> 
                  <hi>Eſtabliſhment) for ever.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Tranſlation nor the Interpretation is the Hiſtorian's, but by him taken out of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> whom no Man thinks to have ridicul'd the Scripture. But let us ſuppoſe, contrary to <hi>Grotius,</hi> that the Hebrew <hi>Elohim</hi> ought to be taken in the Vocative Caſe, thus; <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever:</hi> Yet the Interpretation of <hi>Grotius,</hi> and of the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, affords neither an <hi>abſurd</hi> nor a <hi>trifling</hi> Senſe. The Words in the Pſalms are (by confeſſion of the ableſt <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Interpreters) ſpoken of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and are applied or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to Chriſt, by the Apoſtle: and I think 'tis very good Senſe to ſay, that God was <hi>the Reſting-place, Seat, or Eſtabliſhment,</hi> both of Chriſt and <hi>Solomon.</hi> But (as I ſaid) let us grant, that the Words ſhould be thus rendered and interpreted, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever:</hi> I draw from thence this Inference, If <hi>Solomon,</hi> tho but a Man, is here ſtiled God; then Chriſt, who is a greater Man, may be called ſo too. But when he is here called God, it is not meant that he is <hi>the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream God,</hi> unleſs the Supream God can be ſaid to be <hi>anointed with the Oil of Gladneſs above his Fellows,</hi> which is plainly inconſiſtent with the Notion of a Supream God. Beſides, he who is called God in this place, is ſaid to have <hi>a God, by whom he is anointed;</hi> which can by no means agree to the Supream God: for he can have no God above him, by whom he may be exalted, being himſelf the moſt High.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle in the following Verſes, cites another Paſſage out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 25, 26, 27. which (ſays our Author at <hi>pag.</hi> 201.) is a plain Teſtimony of the Divinity of our Saviour. The Words are theſe, <hi>And thou Lord in the beginning haſt laid the Foundations of the Earth; and the Heavens are the works of thy Hands: they ſhall periſh, but thou remaineſt, and they ſhall all wax old as does a Garment, and as a Veſture ſhalt thou fold them up, and they ſhall be changed: but thou art the ſame, and thy Years fail not.</hi> Now, I ſay, that the Creation of the World cannot be aſcribed to Chriſt in this place. This, I prove, by the Scope of the Apoſtle in this whole Chapter, which is not to ſhew the Excellence which Chriſt has <hi>of himſelf,</hi> but that which he obtained by Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby he <hi>was made</hi> better than An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as appears by <hi>ver.</hi> 4. the Words are theſe, <hi>Being MADE ſo much better than Angels, as he has by Inheritance obtained</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>a more excellent Name than they.</hi> The Greek Word which we tranſlate <hi>obtained by Inheritance,</hi> ſignifies no more than barely <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;</hi> the Words <hi>by Inheritance</hi> are uſeleſs and dangerous, and falſe too, for the Name Chriſt has obtained, came to him by free Donation, not by Inheritance. And therefore it is that the moſt Famous Criticks render <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by <hi>obtinuit, ſortitus eſt,</hi> he gained or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. I ſay therefore, the Apoſtle's Scope is to ſhow the Excellency that Chriſt obtained, not by Nature, or of Himſelf, but that which he had by Donation; and whereby he was made by God better than the Angels. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in this whole Chapter he oppoſes the Glory which Chriſt had been indued with,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64942:18"/>
to the Glory of Angels; and ſhews that His is more excellent and greater than Theirs. So that ſuppoſe Ghriſt had indeed created the World, yet the Creation cannot be aſcribed to him in this Place; for if he had created the World, he ſhould have done it by a Power proper and eſſential to himſelf, not by a Power <hi>received from another.</hi> But the Apoſtle deſigns in this Chapter, not to ſpeak of what is natural or eſſential to Chriſt, but of what he has received from God, whereby he was <hi>made greater</hi> and more excellent than An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſhown, that Chriſt is not ſaid here to have created the World, I muſt now declare, in what Senſe this Text of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> is applied to him. The preceding Words, ſpoken of <hi>Solomon,</hi> are accommodated to him, to expreſs <hi>the Glory and the Duration</hi> of his Kingdom: its Glory, becauſe <hi>God has anointed him with the Oil of Gladneſs above his Fellows;</hi> its Duration, becauſe <hi>his Throne is for ever and ever.</hi> By which glorious and laſting Kingdom, Chriſt has been made much better than An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and obtained a more excellent Name than they: which (as I ſaid before) is the thing, the Apoſtle in this Chapter intended to teach us. Now to the ſame purpoſe he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to Chriſt another place, taken out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. and ſeparated from the other only by the Word <hi>And:</hi> by this other place (or rather, in the Words and Terms of this other place) he confirms what he ſaid before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Duration of Chriſt's Kingdom; and ſhews that tho all things be ſubject to change and alteration, yet Chriſt's Kingdom ſhall be immutable and laſt for ever. <hi>They</hi> (the Heavens and the Earth) <hi>ſhall periſh, but thou remaineſt; and they all ſhall wax old as does a Garment, and as a Veſture ſhalt thou fold them up, and they ſhall be changed; but thou art the ſame, and thy Years fail not.</hi> Theſe Words are uſed as a Confirmation of what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever.</hi> As for ver. 10. <hi>Thou Lord in the beginning has laid the Foundation of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle does not cite it as ſpoken of Chriſt, or with intention to accommodate it to him; but becauſe it was neceſſary for explaining the word, <hi>They (They ſhall periſh)</hi> in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, which he had occaſion to uſe for expreſſing <hi>the Duration</hi> of Chriſt's Kingdom. And now I appeal to any Reader, whether this be <hi>an abſurd</hi> Senſe? Is not this Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clear, and agreeable to the Scope of the Sacred Writer? But is not the Senſe which the Author would put upon this place, both abſurd and inconſiſtent? Can it be ſaid that Chriſt is <hi>made better</hi> than Angels, and obtained a greater Name than they, becauſe he created Heaven and Earth; that is, being ſo before <hi>by Nature,</hi> and from all Eternity, he is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>made better,</hi> and has a more excellent Name than theirs <hi>beſtowed</hi> on him?</p>
               <p>The next place he examines, is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18. <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high, thou haſt led Captivity Captive, thou haſt received Gifts for Men:</hi> Which St. <hi>Paul</hi> applies to Chriſt. Whereupon our Author ſays, <q>The ſingle Queſtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt be that God of whom the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſays, that <hi>He aſcended on High? &amp;c.</hi> If he be not, St. <hi>Paul</hi> has abuſed us, for he applies that to Chriſt, which was not ſaid of him.</q> Here indeed is a very raſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. Were this true, it would follow, that the Sacred Writers of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have abuſed us, as often as they have cited any place of the Old Teſtament <hi>by way of accommodation.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> has again abuſed us, when he applies (at <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 18.) to the Apoſtles theſe Words, <hi>Their ſound went out into all the Earth, and their Words into the ends of the World;</hi> which every one knows and confeſſes are meant (at <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 4.) of the Heavens and other Works of God, which (as it were) preach his Wiſdom and Power and Goodneſs to all Nations. And thus St. <hi>Matthew</hi> (at <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 35.) puts a Trick upon us, when he applies to Chriſt the Words of Pſal. 78. 2. <hi>I will open my Mouth in Parables:</hi> Which the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not of Chriſt. Is our Author ſo little acquainted with the Writers of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as to be ignorant, that they very often cite the Texts of the Old, not as Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Proofs of what they ſay, but by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64942:18"/>
way of Alluſion and Accommodation? Such is the place in queſtion, the Apoſtle thought fit to accommodate the words of the Pſalm, to the matter he was treating of; which was an elegant way of writing, and very much practiſed by the Antient Jews, as may be ſeen both in the Talmud and Rabbins. Let us hear <hi>J. Calvin</hi> on this place; <q>Laſtly, ſays he, we muſt not be too ſcrupulous about the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Senſe of this Pſalm; ſeeing the Apoſtle <hi>only alludes</hi> to the Pſalmiſt's words: even as he applies a place of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the matter in hand at <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>God himſelf can be no Type, ſays our Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 203. for the Type is always leſs perfect than the Anti-type; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever is ſaid of God, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to his Perſon, and cannot belong to any other.</q> But what then? We do not ſay that God is a Type of any other in this Text; nor did the Apoſtle cite the Words as ſuch: we only ſay, that what is ſpoken of God in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is by the Apoſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Chriſt by way of Accommodation; as ſeveral other Paſſages of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are, both by him and other ſacred Writers; as is confeſt by all Interpreters.</p>
               <p>The next Place is <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>When he bringeth the Firſt-begotten into the World, he ſays; and let all the Angels of God worſhip him:</hi> Which laſt Words are commonly thought to be quoted out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 7. To this Allegation the Socinian Hiſtorian anſwers; <q>The Apoſtle does not quote the Words of the Pſalmiſt, as if they were ſpoken of Chriſt; but only declareth the Decree of God (known to him by the Spirit) for ſubjecting the Angels to Chriſt, in the ſame Words that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had uſed on another Occaſion.</q> This is a very ſound and judicious Anſwer; yet our Author can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt ſatisfied with it, for he anſwers; <q>But he proves this Decree of God by no other Revelation, but the Words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> nor pretends any other; and if that don't prove it,</q> we have no other. Yes, we have; for we know from Chriſt himſelf, that <hi>all Power is given to him, both in Heaven and Earth,</hi> and conſequently that he is exalted above all the Orders of Angels: this the Scriptures often teach, and it was believed by all Chriſtians in the time of the Apoſtles. So that when this ſacred Writer ſets before the <hi>Hebrews</hi> the eminent Glory of Chriſt; he does it, only to keep them in mind of it, and to perſwade them never to depart from the Doctrine of ſo great and glorious a Maſter. As if he ſhould have ſaid; <q>You are not ignorant of the Glory Chriſt now injoys <hi>in Heaven;</hi> how Thrones, Powers, Dominions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſubjected to him: for when God brought his Firſt-born and beloved Son into <hi>the Heavenly World,</hi> he ſaid concerning him, what had been ſaid upon another Occaſion, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him;</hi> let them honour, ſerve,</q> and be ſubject to him. This is the true and natural Senſe of this Place; to which I muſt add, (what has been already obſerved by others) that it is probable this Place is quoted out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 43. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lxx; and not out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. For there we find the very Words of the Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>And let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> But in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. we find only, <hi>Worſhip him all ye Gods.</hi> If this be true, as I think it is, our Author's Objection will fall of it ſelf. For thoſe Words in <hi>Deut.</hi> are not ſpoken of God, but of God's People, the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And if this can be ſaid of God's People; I hope it may be ſaid of Chriſt too, without concluding from thence, that he is the Supream God.</p>
               <p>The next Place is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 23. <hi>I have ſworn by my ſelf; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me every Knee ſhall bow.</hi> Which Words of God are applied to Chriſt at <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10, 11. <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt; for it is written, Every Knee ſhall bow to me, and every Tongue ſhall confeſs to God.</hi> To this the Hiſtorian anſwers; <q>In bowing and confeſſing to Chriſt at the laſt Judgment, we are ſaid to bow and confeſs to God; not becauſe Chriſt is God, but becauſe Chriſt then and there holds the place of God, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64942:19"/>
him, and acteth by his Commiſſion. So Men are ſaid to appear before our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord the King, when they appear at the Bar of his Judges; becauſe the Judges act in the King's ſtead, and by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. To this our Author replies; But why does he confine this bowing the Knee <hi>to the laſt Judgment?</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed gives this as one Inſtance, but does not confine it to this; but in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> makes it as large, as the Exaltation of our Saviour; <hi>Wherefore God hath highly exalted him,</hi> &amp;c.</q> And one may plainly ſee, that the Hiſtorian does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the bowing of the Knee <hi>to the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> He only explains the Words of the Apoſtle which relate to it. But what then? The Apoſtle makes the bowing of the Knee as large as Chriſt's Exaltation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. What follows from thence? That Chriſt is God! By no means. It follows only, that we ought to pay Chriſt an Honour propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the Dignity beſtowed on him; in a word, that every Tongue confeſs that he is <hi>Lord, to the Glory of God, the Father.</hi> In which Words the Apoſtle plainly teaches us, that the Honour we pay to Chriſt, is ſubordinate to God, and deſigned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <hi>God's</hi> Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If then, ſays he, we muſt bow to the Perſon of Chriſt, and confeſs him to be the Lord, and this can be an Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's Oath, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me every Knee ſhall bow, and every Tongue ſhall ſwear;</hi> then Chriſt is that God, who in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſwore, That every Knee ſhould bow to him.</q> This is juſt as if one ſhould ſay; If then the Iriſh muſt how to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and confeſs him to be the Lord; and this be the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the King's Will, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me all the Iriſh ſhall bow, and ſwear Allegiance;</hi> then the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> is that King, who will have all the Iriſh to ſwear Allegiance to him. This is a ridiculous Argument; for as the Iriſh may bow to the Perſon of the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> and look upon him as <hi>a Lord</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the King to govern <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſo this they do in compliance with the King's Will, and to ſhew thereby that they are his loyal and faithful Subjects: and he who bows to the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> may be ſaid to bow to the King; becauſe the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> repreſents the King, and acts in his Name. So that it would be non-ſenſe to ſay, the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> is King, becauſe they pay him that Honour. Let us apply this to Chriſt; we muſt bow to him, and confeſs him to be the <hi>Lord;</hi> and by ſo doing, God's Oath is accompliſhed, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me every Knee ſhall bow,</hi> &amp;c. Does it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from thence, that Chriſt is that God, who ſwore in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah?</hi> Not at all; becauſe when we pay this Honour to Chriſt, it is, to obey God's Commands, and to acknowledg his Power and Authority over us. He who honours the Ambaſſador, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours him that ſent him; he who honours Chriſt God's Anointed, honours God who anointed him. In a word, He who bows to Chriſt tho a Man, bows to God alſo.</p>
               <p>The next place, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 33. <hi>As it is written, Behold I lay in</hi> Sion <hi>a ſtumbling-Stone, and Rock of oſſence; and whoſoever believeth on him, ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> Part of theſe Words are taken from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 16. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſpoken of God in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and applied to Chriſt by St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as ſeveral other Texts of the Old Teſtament are: They conclude, Chriſt muſt be that God, ſpoken of in the Prophet. But the Hiſtorian anſwers; that <q>Neither <hi>Peter,</hi> nor <hi>Paul,</hi> cite the Words of the Prophet, as ſpoken of Chriſt; but <hi>only as in ſome ſenſe applicable to him,</hi> namely, becauſe Chriſt alſo was to many a Stone of ſtumbling.</q> To this our Author replies, like a Man ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little acquainted with Scripture: that <q>This is nothing elſe, but to charge the Apoſtles with abuſing Scripture; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Proofs,</q> which are no Proofs. This I have anſwered before. But he tells us, that <q>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> alledges this Prophecy to prove, that the Infidelity of the Jews, and the Offence they ſhould take at Chriſt, was foretold in Scripture.</q> Here I muſt tell him, he is miſtaken. For the Words are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64942:19"/>
no ſuch Prophecy; but are ſpoken of the Times of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> who was to make War againſt the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whom God promiſes to protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, if they will but keep within the Walls of the City, and ſtick cloſe to his Law. The Author adds a conſiderable Reflection; <q>And thus theſe Men, rather than they will allow the Scripture proofs, that Chriſt is God, deſtroy all the Old Teſtament proofs of the Truth of Chriſtianity; and yet if ſuch Texts as theſe, muſt paſs only for Accommodations and Alluſions, I know not where they will find any proofs.</q> Alas! I perceive the Author would be a very unfit Man to convert Jews. When I read firſt this Paſſage of his Book; I could not but wonder, how it came from a Chriſtian. He knows not where we may find any proofs of Chriſtianity, beſides thoſe of the Old Teſtament. Are then the Miracles of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles, nothing? Is Chriſt's Reſurrection no Proof, or but a weak one, of his being ſent by God, and the truth of his Meſſage? Muſt we account as nothing, the Purity of the Goſpel, and its ſwift Propagation thrô the whole World? I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought, with other Chriſtians, that theſe were invincible Arguments for the Truth of our Religion. So they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and by them we ought to convince the Jews: and then we are able to give them a reaſonable Account of all the Texts of the Old Teſtament, that are quoted in the New.</p>
               <p>The firſt place in the New Teſtament, quoted by our Author, is <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations; Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This the Author of the <hi>Brief Hiſtory</hi> explains, after this manner: <q>To be Baptized in the Name of a Perſon or Perſons, is a Rite by which one delivers himſelf to the Inſtitution, Inſtruction, and Obedience of ſuch Perſon or Perſons. So that to be Baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs to be led and guided by them: or (as <hi>Grotius</hi> expreſſes this matter) 'tis to declare, we will admit of no other thing as a part of our Religion, but what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from theſe; that is, Nothing but what is <hi>commanded by God,</hi> or the Father, and has been <hi>delivered by his Son</hi> the Lord Chriſt, and <hi>conſirmed</hi> (externally, by the Miracles; and internally, by the Witneſs and Teſtimony) <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> that is, of the Power and Inſpiration of God.</q> Now all this our Author grants; only he ſays, that <q>Baptiſm being a Religious Rite, it is a Religious Profeſſion of this; a Religious Devoting our ſelves to them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we give up our ſelves to their Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and Guidance, not as Creatures, but as to God; who is both the Author and Object of our Faith and Worſhip.</q> But what is the meaning of all this? We do not deny, that Baptiſm is a Religious Rite, and a Religious Profeſſion of our Faith: we only deny that, becauſe we are Baptized in the Name of the Son and Holy Ghoſt, as well as in the Name of the Father, that therefore the Son and Holy Ghoſt, are Two Divine Perſons, and God as well as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We religiouſly profeſs in Baptiſm, to believe no other Doctrine but what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Father, taught by his Son, and confirmed by the Holy Ghoſt; and the being Baptized in the Name of the Son and Holy Ghoſt, is ſo far from proving, that they are God; that ſuppoſing they are not, yet we muſt of neceſſity be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in their Name. When the Apoſtles made Proſelytes, had they Baptized them only in the Name of the Father; ſuch a Eaptiſm had been no diſtinction of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from Jews; for the Jews believed in the true God, as well as the Chriſtians. So that ſuppoſing Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt are not God, yet ſince the Goſpel was firſt preached by the One, and confirmed by the Other; it was neceſſary that he who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Goſpel, ſhould be Baptized in the Name of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: to profeſs thereby, that he was neither a Jew nor a Pagan, but a Chriſtian; and that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64942:20"/>
he admitted no other Doctrine, but that delivered by the Son, and confirmed by the Holy Ghoſt. This was ſo eſſential to the Baptiſm of a Chriſtian, that we never read in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> that Proſelytes were baptized in the Name of the Father, but <hi>only in the Name of the Son:</hi> of which we can give a reaſonable Account; for all that believed <hi>in God,</hi> did not believe in Chriſt; but whoever believed in Chriſt, believed in God too. One might believe and truſt <hi>in God,</hi> without being a Chriſtian; but whoever believed in Chriſt and was Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in his Name, was both a Worſhipper of the true God, and a Chriſtian. He who was Baptized in the Name of the Son, did publickly profeſs this Belief, that he was ſent from God, and had his Doctrine from him; and by ſuch an Acknowledgment he profeſt at the ſame time, that God bare teſtimony to this Doctrine by the plentiful effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt: So that to be Baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and to be Baptized only in the Name of the Son; are one and the ſame thing. I ſhall conclude this, with the Words of the Learned Mr. <hi>Limborck,</hi> Theol. Chriſt. <hi>pag.</hi> 645. <hi>Dominus Jeſus ritui,</hi> &amp;c. In Engliſh thus; <q>To this Rite before practiſed by <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the Lord Jeſus added another Signification; <hi>viz.</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Name, and the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Doctrine he had preached. Therefore he ordered that Baptiſm ſhould be adminiſtred <hi>in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. That thoſe who ſhould receive the Rite of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, might thereby give up themſelves to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; and profeſs themſelves Diſciples of that Doctrine, which is originally derived from the Father, revealed and preached by the Son, and confirmed by the Holy Ghoſt, with divers Miracles, Signs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, and Diſtributions of Gifts. So that the Reception of Baptiſm, was <hi>a publick Profeſſion of the Doctrine of Chriſt:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that the Faithful are ſaid every where, to be <hi>Baptized in the Name of Chriſt;</hi> that is, to profeſs by their being Baptized, that they receive his Doctrine as Divine, and will be called by his Name, as being their heavenly Maſter and only Saviour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian adds, that, <q>'Tis in vain, not to ſay ridiculouſly pretended; that a Perſon or thing is God, becauſe we are Baptized <hi>unto it,</hi> or <hi>in the Name of it.</hi> For then <hi>Moſes,</hi> and St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> alſo, would be Gods. 1 Cor. 10. 1, 2. <hi>Our Fathers were all Baptized unto</hi> Moſes. Acts 19. 3. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what then were ye baptized? And they ſaid, unto</hi> John<hi>'s Baptiſm;</hi> that is (ſay the Generality of Interpreters) <hi>unto John,</hi> and the Doctrine by him delivered.</q> He replies <hi>pag.</hi> 212. <q>I confeſs he had anſwered this Argument; could he have ſhewn us, that the Jews were baptized in the Name of God, and in the Name of <hi>Moſes, for that had joined</hi> Moſes <hi>with God,</hi> as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour joins the Son and Holy Ghoſt with the Father in the form of Baptiſm.</q> But if the Jews were baptized in the Name of <hi>Moſes;</hi> who can doubt, that they were baptized in the Name of God too; as thoſe who are baptized in the Name of Jeſus, are <hi>thereby</hi> baptized alſo in the Name of God, as has been before ſhewed? It is plain, the Apoſtle compares <hi>Moſes</hi> with Chriſt; and tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that, as they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the Name of Jeſus the Son and Meſſenger of God, ſo the Fathers had been baptized in the Name of <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant of God. But we can afford the Author ſome places of Scripture, wherein <hi>Creatures are joined with God.</hi> Thus, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 31. it is ſaid; <hi>And the People feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and his Servant</hi> Moſes. In the Hebrew 'tis, <hi>in</hi> the Lord and <hi>in Moſes</hi> his Servant. Here <hi>Moſes the Man</hi> is joined with God; and the Jews are ſaid, to <hi>believe in</hi> him, as they believed <hi>in</hi> God. So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the elect Angels, that thou obſerve theſe things,</hi> &amp;c. Here elect Angels, thô Creatures, are ranked with God in ſo great and important a Matter, and act of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64942:20"/>
Religion, as an <hi>Obteſtation.</hi> Again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Grace be to you and Peace from him, which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the ſeven Spirits which are before his Throne.</hi> If <hi>Moſes</hi> and Angels may be joined with God, in Acts of <hi>Faith,</hi> of <hi>Obteſtation,</hi> and of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction;</hi> why not the Son and Spirit in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> thô neither of them is God himſelf? We plainly ſee by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that to be baptized <hi>in the Name of One,</hi> does not import that he is God. 1 Cor. 1. 14, 15. <hi>I thank God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I baptized none of you, but</hi> Criſpus <hi>and</hi> Gaius; <hi>leſt any ſhould ſay, that I had baptized in my own Name.</hi> He plainly intimates, that a meer Man may baptize in his own Name; and if any of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had thought ſo of the Apoſtle, <hi>I</hi> hope they would not have concluded from thence, that he was God, or made himſelf God.</p>
               <p>He adds; <q>It is plain, that to baptize <hi>unto Moſes,</hi> is a Figurative and Alluſive Expreſſion; and does not and cannot ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, that they were baptized in the Name of <hi>Moſes;</hi>
                  </q> becauſe it is not true. Indeed the Jews were not baptized as Chriſtians are; but ſtill they were baptized. Let the Author call it a Figurative and Myſtical Baptiſm, or what elſe he pleaſes; it was ſtill a Baptiſm, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us. And to be baptized <hi>into Moſes,</hi> is the ſame with being baptized <hi>in the Name of</hi> Moſes; as in the New Teſtament to be baptized <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> or <hi>unto</hi> Chriſt, is the ſame with being baptized <hi>in the Name of</hi> Chriſt. This was rightly underſtood by <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> who para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes this place thus; <hi>Scitis etiam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> 
                  <q>You know alſo, that they were all baptized in the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Meſſenger of God; as the Cloud, and the Paſſage thrô the Red-Sea were deſigned for a Confirmation of the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

               <p>But he denies, that, to be baptized <hi>into</hi> Chriſt, and baptized <hi>in the Name of</hi> Chriſt, ſignify the ſame thing. But he miſtakes as groſly, as he uſes to do; for any one may obſerve it, that compares the Texts, where theſe Phraſes are uſed. Thus, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth on him</hi> (in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>into,</hi> or <hi>unto him) is not condemned; but he that believeth not, is condemned already; becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> So at <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. to be baptized <hi>into</hi> Chriſt; and at <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. and 8. 16. to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed <hi>in the Name of</hi> Chriſt, are uſed as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent terms. Indeed, the plain meaning of <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. is this; <q>Know ye not, that ſo many of us as were baptized in the Name of Chriſt, and profeſt to obey his Doctrine, lay thereby under an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Spiritual Conformity to his Death; in dying to Sin, as he is dead; and living to God, as he is raiſed from the dead and lives with God.</q> So that the firſt words, contrary to our Author's Aſſertion, relate to the form of adminiſtring Baptiſm in the Name of Jeſus; and the latter to the effect of it. This we may apply alſo to <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27.</p>
               <p>He further denies, That to be baptized <hi>unto,</hi> or <hi>into</hi> John<hi>'s Baptiſm,</hi> ſignifies to be baptized in the Name of <hi>John:</hi> for (ſays he) <hi>John</hi> did not baptize in his own Name; but made Proſelytes to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> But I hope he will not deny, that to be baptized <hi>into Chriſt's Baptiſm</hi> is all one with being baptized <hi>in the Name of Chriſt.</hi> And if this be ſo, to be baptized <hi>into</hi> John<hi>'s Baptiſm,</hi> muſt alſo ſignify to be baptized <hi>in the Name of</hi> John. <hi>John</hi> indeed made Proſelytes to the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> but he preached the Doctrine of Repentance, and he who was baptized by him, was baptized into the Profeſſion of the Doctrine taught by him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whoever profeſt in his Baptiſm, to follow the Doctrine of <hi>John,</hi> might be ſaid to be baptized to the Doctrine of <hi>John,</hi> or in the Name of <hi>John.</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, He asks, Whether it be not very abſurd, that the Power or Inſpiration of God, which is not a Perſon, ſhould be joined <hi>in the ſame Form</hi> with the Father and Son, who are Perſons? I anſwer; I ſee no abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, in being baptized into the Profeſſion of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64942:21"/>
a Doctrine, which not only comes originally from God the Father, and is revealed by his Son, but is confirmed by the Power or Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>The next and laſt Place of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which our Auther conſiders, is the firſt Chapter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Goſpel:</hi> Which, ſays he, <hi>pag.</hi> 215. gives a glorious Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the Divinity of Chriſt; and a plain Demonſtration of the incurable Perverſeneſs of Hereticks. I will examine this High Pretence; and ſhew theſe three Things. 1. The Abſurdity of the Author's Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Chapter. 2. The Inconſiſtency of the Trinitarian Hypotheſis with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. 3. The true ſenſe and meaning of this ſo much controverted Place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Hiſtorian ſaid, that the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Expoſition of this Chapter is abſurd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious, and that it is this; <q>
                     <hi>In the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> i. e. from all Eternity.</q> But, How (ſaith the Hiſtorian) can <hi>in the Beginning,</hi> be <hi>from all Eternity?</hi> From all Eternity is <hi>before</hi> the Beginning, or <hi>without</hi> Beginning, not <hi>in</hi> the Beginning. To this our Author replies, That <hi>No Man expounds in the beginning of Eternity.</hi> But he ſhould not be ſo bold in his Aſſertions; for Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> expounds it ſo. He adds; <q>When St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>In the Beginning was the Word;</hi> we ſay this proves the Eternity of the Word: for that which <hi>was,</hi> when all things began which had a beginning, was it ſelf before the beginning and without beginning.</q> I anſwer, had the Evangeliſt deſigned to teach us the Eternity of the Word; he would undoubtedly have done it by the ſame Characters, that are uſed in Scripture to expreſs the Eternity of God. Now this Expreſſion, <hi>in the Beginning,</hi> is ſo far from denoting Eternity, that it is never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to God in that Senſe. We read in Scripture, That <hi>In the Beginning God created Heaven and Earth,</hi> Gen. 1. 1. Heb. 1. 10. a plain Demonſtration that <hi>In the beginning</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be applied to him that is God, but only to Creatures; and as plain a Demonſtration that God himſelf is from all Eternity; for he who created all things, muſt needs be (not only before all things, but) from Eternity. But we never read <hi>God was in the Beginning,</hi> in all the Deſcriptions which the Scriptures afford us of his Eternity: nay, they rather declare it or deſcribe it by, <hi>Before the beginning,</hi> Pſal. 90. 2. <hi>Before the Mountains were brought forth;—even from everlaſting to everlaſting thou art God.</hi> Here Eternity is deſcribed by <hi>before the beginning.</hi> This is the Scripture-Notion of Eternity: therefore if St. <hi>John</hi> had intended to ſhew the Eternity of the Word, he ſhould not have ſaid <hi>In the beginning was the Word;</hi> but as 'tis ſaid of God, <hi>In the beginning the Word created the Heaven and the Earth.</hi> Nor will it avail any thing to ſay; <q>The Word was ſo in the beginning; that <hi>all things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</hi>
                  </q> For as the foregoing Words, <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> are no true Deſcription of Eternity in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo neither are theſe, <hi>All things were made by him, &amp;c.</hi> the Scripture-Deſcription of the Creation. There is no mention here made either of the Heaven, or the Earth, or the Sea, which are never omitted in the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have in Scripture of the firſt and true Creation, a I ſhewed before; and therefore there is no need to inſiſt longer on this Phraſe in this place.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian goes on. <q>
                     <hi>Was the Word,</hi> i. e. <hi>was God the Son?</hi> But where in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſays he, is the Word called God the the Son?</q> Our Author replies: <q>This <hi>Word</hi> indeed is God the Son; but we do not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe it ſo in this place, <hi>In the beginning was God the Son:</hi> but, <hi>In the beginning was that Divine Perſon who is called the Word.</hi>
                  </q> But I pray, what is the meaning of this? For if the Word is indeed God the Son, one may paraphraſe it here, In the beginning was God the Son; as well as, In the beginning was that Divine Perſon called the Word: the one is as fit, and as good Senſe as the other. But it ſeems, our Author is aſham'd to paraphraſe <hi>the Word,</hi> by <hi>God the Son:</hi> this is a Modeſty in him, which is but ſeldom found in his Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:64942:21"/>
                  <hi>Hiſtor.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>The Word was God,</hi> i. e. The Son was with the Father. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſeems then that God in this Clauſe, is the Father. But was not the Son alſo with the Holy Ghoſt, and is not he too (according to <hi>Trinitarians)</hi> God, or a God? If he is, why does St. <hi>John</hi> only ſay, the Son was with the Father; and how comes the Father to ingroſs here the Title of God, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Holy Ghoſt?</q> To avoid the ſtrength of this Argument, our Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; <q>By <hi>God,</hi> the Apoſtle here means that Original Mind and Wiſdom, that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and Soveraign Being, whom all Men called God, without making a Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Perſons in the Godhead.</q> But if <hi>God</hi> in this place does not ſignify the Father only, but the Three Perſons of the Trinity; he ſhould not tell us, that the Apoſtle here means that Original Mind and Wiſdom, but <hi>thoſe Three Minds whom all Men called God;</hi> for we are taught all over his Book, that God is Three infinite Minds; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Three Wiſdoms, for an infinite Mind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without Wiſdom: Neither ſhould he ſay, <hi>That Supream and Soveraign Being,</hi> whom all Men call God, but thoſe Three Supream and Soveraign Beings: for he often tells us, that <hi>God is Three infinite and ſubſtantial Beings;</hi> therefore he is Three Supream and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Beings. It is a plain Contradiction, to ſay in one place, God is Three Minds and Three Beings; and in another, that he is but one Mind and one Being. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, when the Evangeliſt ſays, <hi>The Word was with God,</hi> if by God he means not the Father only, but the Three Perſons who are that God; this will make a very trifling ſenſe. For then, <hi>the Word was with God,</hi> muſt ſignify, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſecond Perſon of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was with the Three Perſons of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and conſequently with himſelf; which is not only trifling, but ridiculous.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle adds; <hi>And the Word was God.</hi> Our Author to ſerve his Hypotheſis, puts here another or a new ſenſe on the word <hi>God:</hi> for he ſaw it was inconſiſtent with his Opinion; that in this Clauſe <hi>God</hi> ſhould be interpreted, as it was in the foregoing. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it would be ſtrange Non-ſenſe; for then <hi>the Word was God</hi> ſhould ſignify, the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity was with the Three Perſons of the Trinity. Therefore in his Hypotheſis, <hi>the Word was God,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>the Word was a Divine Perſon in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, pag.</hi> 216. But this Interpretation is no leſs abſurd than the other; for by <hi>the Word,</hi> he underſtands a Divine Perſon who is called <hi>the Word,</hi> and by <hi>God</hi> too he means a Divine Perſon in the Godhead. Therefore his Interpretation of theſe Words, <hi>the Word was God,</hi> amounts only to this, the Divine Perſon, who is called the Word, was a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon.</p>
               <p>But to give us a right and full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this place, he thought ſit to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe it thus; <q>
                     <hi>In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;</hi> that is, In the Beginning of all Things was the Divine Perſon, whoſe Name and Character is <hi>the Word;</hi> this Word was inſeparably united to that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Being, whom we call God, and was himſelf God, a Divine Perſon ſubſiſting in the Unity of the Godhead; not a Power and Faculty as Reaſon is in Man.</q> I hope the Author will not take it ill, if I para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe his Paraphraſe, to make it clearer to vulgar Underſtandings. <q>In the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all Things, was the ſecond Divine Perſon of the Trinity, whoſe Name and Character is the Word; this ſecond Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon of the Trinity was inſeparably united with the Three Perſons of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whom we call God, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with himſelf; and this ſecond Perſon was a Divine Perſon, not a Power and Faculty,</q> as Reaſon is in Man. Our Author was ſo taken with this ſenſe of the Words of St. <hi>John,</hi> that he could not for bear breaking out into theſe Words, <hi>Can any thing be more eaſy and obvious, and more agreeable to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity?</hi> I confeſs, 'tis very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thô I have ſhown already the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of the Trinitarian Hypotheſis, with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64942:22"/>
the Firſt Chapter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Goſpel,</hi> by confuting the Author's Explication; yet I intend to make it appear farther, by theſe few Conſiderations: (1.) That <hi>to be in the Beginning,</hi> cannot here ſignify, to be from all Eternity, has been proved already; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture does never deſcribe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity by ſuch an Expreſſion, nor does the Expreſſion <hi>in its own Nature</hi> denote Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: St. <hi>John</hi> would not have expreſſed ſo great a Myſtery, and ſo neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by All, in improper and unſuitable Words. (2.) For the Word to be with God, and to be God, can never bear the ſenſe which the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> put upon it. When <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>the Word was with God;</hi> if by <hi>God</hi> we muſt underſtand the Three Perſons of the Trinity, and by <hi>the Word</hi> a Divine Perſon in that Trinity; this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation makes, as I have ſhewed, this abſurd ſenſe; <q>The ſecond Divine Perſon of the Trinity was with the Three Perſons of the Trinity, and conſequently with himſelf.</q> But if by <hi>God</hi> we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>the Father</hi> only; why does St. <hi>John</hi> omit the Holy Ghoſt, who is God as well as the Father, and with whom the Son was no leſs than with the Father? In a word (as the Hiſtorian ſpeaks) How comes the Father to ingroſs here the Title of <hi>God,</hi> to the excluſion of the Holy Ghoſt? (3.) <hi>The Word was God,</hi> muſt ſignify in this Hypotheſis; <q>That Divine Perſon who is called the Word,</q> was a Divine Perſon. (4.) All <hi>Trinitarians</hi> confeſs, that St. <hi>John</hi> in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſpeaks of the New Creation wrought by the Goſpel, as well as of the Old; and thô they do not agree among themſelves about the place, where he begins to treat of this New Creation or Regeneration; yet they do all grant, that he diſcourſes of it before, Ver. 14. <hi>And the Word was made Fleſh.</hi> They all take thoſe words, <hi>He came unto his own,</hi> Ver. 11. to be meant of Chriſt's converſing among Men, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the way of Salvation. But if <hi>the Word was made Fleſh,</hi> at Ver. 14. ſignifies Chriſt's Incarnation, as <hi>Trinitarians</hi> pretend, it is unaccountable that St. <hi>John,</hi> writing the Hiſtory of Chriſt's Life, ſhould firſt tell us <hi>what Chriſt Incarnate has done,</hi> and then that <hi>He was Incarnate.</hi> This is juſt as if one, writing the Life of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſhould ſay, he overcame <hi>Darius;</hi> and then, that he was begotten by <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon.</hi> Or, that Chriſt was tempted of the Devil; and then, that he was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt. Indeed it cannot be denied, that the Evangeliſts do not very much obſerve the order of time, in relating ſeveral Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Miracles of Chriſt; but this is of no great moment, and does not deſtroy <hi>the proper and eſſential order of Hiſtory.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer has been done by the Evangeliſts, as well as by other Hiſtorians; but never the latter. They never tell us, that Chriſt went about to preach the Goſpel; and then, that he was born: or that, he was raiſed from the dead; and then, that he died. This would be to invert the true order of Hiſtory, and make Non-ſenſe of it: And therefore it ſufficiently proves that theſe words, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh,</hi> coming after <hi>He came unto his own,</hi> cannot be meant of Chriſt's Incarnation. Thus Ver. 6, 7. <hi>John</hi> is ſaid to bear witneſs of Chriſt, and then that he was Incarnate. The like we may obſerve on Ver. 10. <hi>He was in the World, and the World was made by him;</hi> if thoſe Words, <hi>The World was made by him,</hi> are to be underſtood in a proper ſenſe of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid firſt, that the World <hi>was made by him,</hi> and then that <hi>He was in the World.</hi> (5.) This Evangeliſt plainly tells us (Chap. 20. Ver. 21.) the deſign he aimed at when he wrote his Goſpel; <hi>Theſe Things are written, that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have Life thrô his Name.</hi> It was not therefore to teach the Divinity and Conſubſtantiality of Chriſt, as <hi>Trinitarians</hi> pretend. He wrote, that we might be ſure that Jeſus is the Chriſt, <hi>the Son of God,</hi> not that he was God. How comes he then to forget the moſt eſſential Thing, which induced him to write and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64942:22"/>
his Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> the aſſerting of Chriſt's Divinity? No, no, it is plain, he only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to teach and prove, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God. And the Son of God can no more be God, than a Son can be his Father. Thus I think it appears clearly, that this Beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Goſpel</hi> does not favour the Trinitarian O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; but from Ver. 1, to Ver. 15. is only an Abridgment of his whole Book. Were the Trinitarian Hypotheſis clearly ſet down in other places of Scripture, I would not wonder to ſee Men lay ſo much ſtreſs upon this place: but ſince the Scriptures throughout teach us, that Chriſt was but a Man; it ſtands to reaſon, that we ſhould explain one obſcure place by a thouſand that are plain and eaſy.</p>

                     <p n="1">1.

Our Lord calls himſelf <hi>the Way,</hi> becauſe he teaches us the way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and <hi>the Light,</hi> in this very Chapter, becauſe he is the bringer of it: therefore why not alſo <hi>the Word of God,</hi> becauſe he was the Revealer, Bringer, and firſt Preacher of it?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It appears by the ſecond Verſe, that the Evangeliſt did not deſign to make a real Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, between <hi>to be in the beginning,</hi> and <hi>to be with God;</hi> for what was diſtinctly ſpoken in the firſt Verſe, is put together in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, thus, <hi>The ſame was in the beginning with God.</hi> In effect, the meaning of the Apoſtle is not, that Chriſt was, when he began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon his Prophetick Office; this would be no great wonder: but that, when he began to preach the Doctrine of the Goſpel, he was admitted into the moſt intimate Counſels of God, or made partaker of his moſt ſecret Will. This I think to be the reaſon of the Repetition contained in the ſecond Verſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that we may obſerve, that Repetitions are very frequent throughout the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of St. <hi>John,</hi> and more uſed in that Book than in any other of the New Teſtament. Thus when the ſame Apoſtle ſays, 1 John 1. 1. <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, &amp;c.</hi> he does not pretend really to diſtinguiſh thoſe two things, and to ſay that the Goſpel was in the beginning of the Goſpel; but that what he had ſeen and heard of the Goſpel from the beginning of it, that he declared unto Men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I have proved before, that <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> cannot ſignify the beginning of the World: but that it is here uſed for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Goſpel, the place laſt quoted (and ſeveral others) do ſufficiently prove.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>To be with God,</hi> and <hi>to be in the Boſom of the Father</hi> (at ver. 18.) are equivalent Terms. If therefore we know the true Senſe of the latter Expreſſion, we ſhall have a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the former. The Words at <hi>ver.</hi> 18. run thus; <hi>No Man hath ſeen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the Boſom of the Father, he has declared him.</hi> Now to ſee God in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Stile, is to know the Decrees and Will of God concerning the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel. Thoſe words therefore ought to be thus paraphraſed; <q>No Man knew at
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64942:23"/>
any time the Will and Decrees of God, concerning the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel: the beloved Son of God, who was admitted into his moſt ſecret Counſels, has fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them to us.</q> The Word <hi>Only-begotten,</hi> is put here for <hi>Beloved,</hi> by way of Excellence; and ſo it is uſed very often, both in Profane and Sacred Authors. And to be <hi>in the Boſom of the Father,</hi> is not here an Interpretation of <hi>Only-begotten</hi> (that is, Beſt-Beloved) but it is brought in as the reaſon of the full knowledg that Chriſt had of God's Will, and of the diſcovery he made of it. Chriſt, ſaith our Evangeliſt here, has fully declared the Will and Counſels of God to us. How ſo? Becauſe he was intimate and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the moſt ſecret and hidden Counſels of God; which he expreſſes by the Son's being <hi>in the Boſom</hi> of the Father. This is then the true Senſe of this Phraſe, <hi>The Word was with God, viz.</hi> God diſcovered to him the whole extent of his Will, he kept nothing ſecret from him, he filled him up with the Treaſures of, Wiſdom and Knowledg.</p>
                     <p n="5">5.

Chriſt was in the form of God, and like God; by reaſon of the Power and Authority beſtowed upon him, whereby he wrought all ſorts of Miracles; raiſing the Dead, curing the Lame, reſtoring ſight to the Blind, ſtilling the Winds and the Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This we may apply to the words of St. <hi>John.</hi> Jeſus was not only in the Boſom of God, Partaker of his moſt ſecret Counſels; but he was beſides inveſted with ſuch Authority and Power, as made him like God. So that Chriſt is by St. <hi>John</hi> called <hi>God</hi> (or rather, <hi>a</hi> God) by reaſon of that Power and Authortiy, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in ſome manner like unto the true and moſt High God. But this Appellation does no more prove him to be the <hi>true and moſt High God,</hi> than <hi>Solomon,</hi> or the Judges, in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> will be <hi>the True God,</hi> becauſe this Name <hi>God</hi> is given to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 6. and 45. 6.</p>

               <p>HIS ſecond Charge is, That Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm makes the Jewiſh Oeconomy very unreaſonable and unaccountable, <hi>pag.</hi> 231. becauſe if Chriſt were no more than a meer Man, the Anti-type ſhould fall very ſhort of the Types contained in the Old Teſtament. <q>The Tabernacle and Temple, ſays he, was God's Houſe where he choſe to dwell by the viſible Symbols of his Preſence; and was ſo contrived, as to be the Figure both of Heaven and Earth; for ſo the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expreſly tells us, the Holy of Holies was a Figure of Heaven.—But we muſt all confeſs, that this was a very unaccountable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant Ceremony, for God, who fills Heaven and Earth with his Preſence, to dwell in an Houſe made with Hands,—had it not prefigured ſomething more Divine and Myſterious.—The Temple then was a Figure, and we muſt inquire, what it was the Figure of? Now a Typical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence can be a Figure of nothing but a real Preſence, and God's Perſonal dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men: for Preſence and Habitation can ſignify nothing but Preſence, and a Figure muſt be a Figure of ſome thing that is real; and nothing can anſwer to a figurative viſible Preſence of God, but a perſonal viſible Preſence.</q> He goes on, and applies this to Chriſt, who (at <hi>John</hi> 2. 19.) calls his Body a Temple; which (ſays our Author) was that in Truth and Reality, which the Temple was but a Figure of, that is, <hi>God's Preſence on Earth,</hi> which he explains of his being perſonally united to Chriſt's Humane Nature. <q>But if Chriſt be not Incarnate, adds he, if the Divine Word be not perſonally united to the Humane Nature; the Body of Chriſt is but a figurative Temple, as the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was: and then one Figure is made a Type of another; which is as great an Abſurdity in Types, as a Metaphor of a Metaphor in ſpeech.</q> I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I ever ſaw ſo much trifling, ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly urged in a weighty Queſtion: but I have undertaken the drudgery of making Reflections on it; and therefore will conſider what he has offered.—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Temple was a Figure both of Heaven and Earth, I am content to admit; the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to that purpoſe. But that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Type of Chriſt's Body, we have no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour from Scripture to affirm it; and the Author has offer'd no other ground for it, but his own wandring Fancy.</p>
               <p>The Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon the Temple, does not give the leaſt Intimation of this: why then ſhould we contrive Types and Figures of our own, without any reaſon for it? If this be allowed, we may make Types of any thing; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Figures to an infinite Number. If the Author is in love with cold and groundleſs Allegories, every Body is not of his Mind, and therefore he ſhould keep them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But why ſhould the Temple be a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſt's Body, rather than the Ark? God is ſaid, all over the Old Teſtament, to dwell between the Cherubims; it was the proper Seat of God, where he gave forth his Oracles, and made his <hi>Glory</hi> to appear
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64942:24"/>
by affording ſenſible Signs of his Preſence. If therefore ſuch Allegories had any Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of future Times and Things, it would be more probable that the Ark was a Type of Chriſt's Body, than the Temple: the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe we know already by a Divine Teſtimony, that the Temple was a Figure of ſome-thing elſe. But he will ſay, that Chriſt calls his Body a Temple. What then? ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Corinthians; <hi>Ye are,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Temple of God.</hi> Was the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a Figure or Type of the Bodies of the Corinthians? Or does our Saviour ſay, that he calls his Body a Temple, becauſe it was the Anti-type of the Temple of the Jews?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Tho the Temple were not a Figure of Chriſt's Body, yet it would be no unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and inſignificant Ceremony, for God to dwell in an Houſe made with Hands; to appoint this the place of his Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which our Author thinks to be inexplicable without admitting his Doctrine of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Who knows not, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were given to Idolatry; and that the pompous way of Worſhip uſed among the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, agreed ſo much to their Fancies, that it was neceſſary to comply with them in this thing, that they might be kept from worſhipping other Gods, and the current of Idolatry be reſtrained. Thus God in his infinite Wiſdom thought fit to ſet up among his People a carnal and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Worſhip; and to appoint an Houſe where he would dwell after a particular Manner, and afford viſible Symbols of his Preſence. All this he did to accommodate himſelf to the groſs genius of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and to perſwade them to forſake Idols, and to acknowledg no other God but himſelf. This was the true reaſon of the Temple, of God's dwelling there, and the Glory with which it was ſometimes filled: and to affirm that all was done, to prefigure Chriſt's Body, is a Fancy which the Author might better have kept to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſe the Temple was a Type of Chriſt's Body; yet there is no need God ſhould be incarnate in Chriſt's Body, to anſwer that Type. The Scriptures tell us, God was <hi>with</hi> Chriſt, and <hi>in</hi> Chriſt; which I hope might be done without an Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Perſonal Union, as he was in the Temple. As God ſpake in the Temple, ſo he ſpake <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> Chriſt. But beſides all this, Chriſt was <hi>greater than the Temple;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God was <hi>always</hi> preſent with him, which cannot be ſaid of the Temple, where the Signs of God's Preſence were not always viſible. God's Dwelling in Chriſt was always conſpicuous by the Oracles which he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Miracles he wrought.</p>
               <p>But he objects a place of Scripture. <q>To this, ſays he, St. <hi>John</hi> plainly alludes; <hi>The Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us, and we beheld his Glory, the Glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>tabernacled</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; fulfilled that Type of God's dwelling in the Tabernacle and Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by his dwelling Perſonally in Humane Nature.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument, or rather Congruity, is grounded on two falſe Suppoſitions. The firſt is, that <hi>The Word was made Fleſh,</hi> is meant of Chriſt's Incarnation. The ſecond, that in theſe Words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we render <hi>he dwelt amongſt us;</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> alludes to God's dwelling in the Tabernacle. I begin with the firſt. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be rendred <hi>was,</hi> as well as <hi>was made.</hi> Thus it is taken, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 5. and 24. 19. and even at Verſe 6. of this Chapter. Nor can it be doubted that the word <hi>Fleſh</hi> ſignifies not only <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature;</hi> but very often Humane Nature <hi>as ſubject to Infirmities and Afflictions.</hi> Now is it not more agreeable to Reaſon and Scripture, to interpret theſe words thus; <q>And the Word (Jeſus) <hi>was</hi> a Man like unto us in all things, Sin excepted; having the ſame Mortal Nature, being expoſed to the ſame Miſeries and Afflictions:</q> than to ſay, <hi>The Word was Incarnate,</hi> which is a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage unknown to Scripture; wherein we never find, that God made himſelf Man;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64942:24"/>
and altogether repugnant to Reaſon? And this I confirm by <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Foraſmuch then as the Children are Partakers of Fleſh and Blood; He likewiſe himſelf took part of the ſame, that thrô Death he might deſtroy him that had the Power of Death, even the Devil.</hi> Here Chriſt is ſaid to be Partaker of Fleſh and Blood, as pious Men are; which cannot be meant in a ſenſe of Incarnation, for pious Men are not ſaid to be Incarnate: but the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are Partakers of Fleſh and Blood, that is, of Infirmities and Sufferings. This he explains farther at Verſe 17. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren:</hi> but his Brethren were not Incarnate. But at Ver. 10, and 18. he expreſly expounds this of Chriſt's Sufferings: Ver. 10. <hi>It became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, to make the Captain of their Salvation, perfect through Sufferings.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered,—he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> Mr. <hi>Limborck</hi> ſaw and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed this that I have been ſaying; his Words are theſe, <hi>Theol. Chriſt. pag.</hi> 226. <q>The true ſenſe of this place, is, that <hi>the Word was Fleſh:</hi> That is, a true fleſhly Subſtance, ſubject to all the Infirmities that attend our Fleſh; that is to ſay, He was Mortal, Vile and Contemptible. Which appeared more eſpecially in the days of his Paſſion and of his Death, which are called at <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>The days of his Fleſh.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Author, charmed with Allegories and myſterious Interpretations, has found out, that St. <hi>John</hi> alludes here to God's dwelling in the Tabernacle; and this he thinks God did, to make the Anti-type anſwer the Type, Chriſt's Body to the Tabernacle or Temple. Since he is ſo much in love with Allegories, it may be I may do him a kindneſs to help him to one, which I have ready at hand; it is this: As the Tabernacle in the Wilderneſs had no fixed place to ſtand in, as the Temple afterwards had, but was carried from one place to another; according to the ſeveral Incampments of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> So Chriſt, to fulfil that Type, was always wandring with his Diſciples, having <hi>no where to lay his Head;</hi> Mat. 8. 20. This Allegory is as probable, and more natural than his; without ſuppoſing an impoſſible Incarnation. I cannot tell, whether the Author will like it better than his own; I am ſure, I like neither of them. No, no, there is no Myſtery in the Greek Word: Our <hi>Verſion</hi> renders it well, <hi>He dwelt among us:</hi> So does <hi>Seb. Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, Et apud nos, Gratiae Veritatiſ<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> plenus, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitavit; And he full of Grace and Truth dwelt among us.</hi> And the ſame word is thus uſed without any Myſtery, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. and 13. 6. where it is applied to the Inhabitants of Heaven. By way of concluſion, I will ſet down the ſenſe of the whole Verſe, which is an Abridgment of the Life of Chriſt:
<q>
                     <hi>The Word was Fleſh,</hi> a mortal Man, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Sufferings and Death: here is his Prieſtly Office. <hi>He dwelt among us full of Grace and Truth;</hi> here is his Prophetic Office. <hi>We have ſeen his Glory;</hi> here is his Kingly Office.</q> Thus therefore we ought to paraphraſe the whole; <q>Jeſus Chriſt was a Mortal Man, Partaker of Fleſh and Blood, ſubject to the ſame Infirmities that we are; in a word, like unto us in all things, but Sin. And he dwelt among us, preaching the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py News of Reconciliation with God, and the Doctrine and Truth revealed to him by the Father. But thô he were a Mortal Man, a Man of Sufferings and Griefs; yet we have ſeen his Glory, ſhining in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, his Transfiguration, his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Aſcenſion into Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such a Glory as was well becoming <hi>the beloved</hi> Son of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſpoken of the Temple, he comes to diſcourſe of Sacrifices, and tells us; <q>The true meaning of <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World,</hi> is not meerly that he was ſlain <hi>in God's Decree;</hi> for what God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to be done, is not therefore ſaid to be done, before it is done. But this Lamb was ſlain in Types and Figures, from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World; ever ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> in thoſe early Sacrifices which were offered after the Fall, which were Typical of the Sacrifice of Chriſt.</q> But, 1. Where
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64942:25"/>
has he found, that thoſe early Sacrifices were Typical of the Sacrifice of Chriſt? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſilent about it; and the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who inlarges on the Sacrifices of the <hi>Moſaical Law,</hi> does not ſo much as mention thoſe that were offer'd before; which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable, if they were Figures of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt. 2. But he ſays; <q>He knows no Principle of natural Reaſon, that teaches us to offer the Blood of Beaſts to God; and therefore he muſt think, the Sacrifices of Beaſts to be an Inſtitution.</q> But ſuppoſe thoſe early Sacrifices were an Inſtitution, does it follow from thence, that they were inſtituted to be Types of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt? By no means: God might have other Reaſons for ſuch an Appointment. But ſince the Scripture does not mention the appointing of thoſe Sacrifices; we have good reaſon to believe, that they were of Humane Inſtitution: for had God appointed them, it would not (it ſhould ſeem) have been omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Scripture. 'Tis reaſonable to think, that <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> thought fit to offer Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Oblations to God; to ſhew by ſuch viſible Marks, the Senſe they had of God's Majeſty; and to expreſs the Reverence they ought to pay to him. 3. To deny, that the Lamb was ſlain from the Foundation of the World meerly in God's Decree, <hi>becauſe what God has decreed to be done, is not therefore ſaid to be done before it is done,</hi> is no very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate reaſoning in a Divine; becauſe 'tis contrary to the ſtile of Scripture. Is there any thing more uſual with the ſacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, eſpecially with the Prophets, than to ſpeak of things to come, as if they were come to paſs already, by reaſon of their certainty and the immutable Decree of God? And why then cannot the Lamb be ſaid to be ſlain from the beginning of the World, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe God had certainly decreed it ſhould be ſo? 4. But if he is not ſatisfied with this Explication, here is another for him. There is a <hi>Tranſpoſition</hi> in the words of this Verſe, which alſo may be obſerved in many other Texts of Scripture; ſo that the Verſe may be read thus, <hi>Whoſe Names are not written from the Foundation of the World, in the Book of Life, of the Lamb ſlain.</hi> This reading is confirmed by Chap. 17. Ver. 8. <hi>Whoſe Names are not written in the Book of Life, from the Foundation of the World.</hi> So the ſenſe of the controverted Text, is; <q>The Names of thoſe who worſhip the Dragon were never written in the Book of Life of the ſlain Lamb; that is, in the Book of the Martyrs and Confeſſors of Chriſt, who were deſtined to eternal Life from the Foundations of the World.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 237. <q>He deſires ſome of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Reaſoning <hi>Socinians,</hi> honeſtly to tell him; what account they can give of the Jewiſh Prieſthood and Sacrifices, which is <hi>becoming God.</hi> Why ſhould God he propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated by a Man, ſubject to the ſame Sins and Infirmities, and very often guilty of them, that other Men are? Why innocent Beaſts muſt die, to expiate the Sins of Men?</q> The thing he aims at, is to prove that the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine ridicules the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy. How ſo? The <hi>Jews</hi> Sacrifices, ſays he, were Typical of Chriſt's Sacrifice. We grant it; for ſo the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates: we ſay only, that this was not the chief and primary end for which they were inſtituted. But what then? The Death of Chriſt was therefore a Sacrifice. So it was. Then he was not a Metaphorical Prieſt. No more he was. Then he was the Divine Word Incarnate. How ſo? This he ſhould prove, but he takes it for granted. I want the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Spectacles, how to draw this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>therefore the Socinian Doctrine ridicules the Jewiſh Oeconomy,</hi> from that Argument. Now to this Queſtion, concerning the Jewiſh Prieſthood and Sacrifices, I anſwer with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 3. 19. <hi>The Law</hi> (the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, the Law of Sacrifices and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Rites) <hi>was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions:</hi> i. e. by reaſon of the Idolatry of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which could not be reſtrained but by ſuch a Method. Had not the <hi>Jews</hi> been inclined ſo much to Idolatry, by ſeeing the Worſhip of their Neighbours round them; God would not have put on their Necks this <hi>Yoke, which</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays) <hi>they were not able to bear.</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:64942:25"/>
God himſelf ſays this, Jer. 7. 22. <hi>I ſpake not unto your Fathers nor commanded them, in the day that I brought them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>concerning Burnt-Offerings or Sacrifices: But this thing commanded I them, ſaying, Obey my Voice, and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my People.</hi> Here we may plainly ſee, that God at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired nothing from his People, but to own him, and obey his reaſonable Laws, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Political Laws he deſigned for them: but he was, as it were, conſtrained to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Sacrifices, and other external and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Rites, by their Idolatrous Inclination. I refer our Author, about this matter, to Learned Dr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> the beſt Writer on the Ceremonial Law. This then is the true and primary Reaſon of God's appointing Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; and very well <hi>becoming both</hi> his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs. And it hinders not, but thoſe Sacrifices might be alſo Typical of the Sacrifice of Chriſt: they were ſo, ſecondarily. God who appointed Sacrifices to ſtop the progreſs of Idolatry, did alſo by them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure the Sacrifice of Chriſt. <hi>But a meer Man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>can be no more than a Metaphorical and Typical Prieſt and Sacrifice.</hi> This, I think, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be proved. A Metaphorical or Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Prieſt and Sacrifice are here oppoſed to a true Prieſt and Sacrifice; yet he tells us, that <hi>tho the Prieſts and Sacrifices of the Law were Typical, they were true and proper Prieſts and Sacrifices; and made a true and proper expiation for Sin, as far as they reached.</hi> But if the Prieſts of the Law were true and proper Prieſts, and the Sacrifices true and proper Sacrifices; much more will the Sacrifice of Chriſt be a true and proper Sacrifice, tho he alſo was a Man. This Conſequence the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has afforded us. Now becauſe the Anti-Type, as he ſays, ought to be greater than the Type; what remains, is only to inquire, Whether Chriſt be a more excellent Prieſt and Sacrifice, than the Prieſts and Sacrifices of the Law? The Prieſts of the Law were but ordinary Men, diſtinguiſhed from others only by the Dignity of their Prieſthood: but Chriſt was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Son of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with his ſecret Will, indued with an in menſe Authority and Power, and made (as it were) God by the unſpeakable Gifts of God his Father. The Prieſts of the Law were called to their Prieſt-hood in an ordinary ways but Chriſt by God's immediate appointment. The High-Prieſts of the Law entred only into a Tabernacle made with Hands, and but once a Year into the <hi>most Holy</hi> Place; but Chriſt into a Tabernacle whoſe Builder and Maker is God, and is to continue there for ever. Surely therefore, tho he is a Man only, this Anti-Type is more excellent than the Types, and Chriſt a more excellent High-Prieſt and Sacrifice than thoſe of the Law. So that here is no ridiculing the Jewiſh Oeconomy, by the <hi>Socinian</hi> Hypotheſis: but our Author by ſuch ungrounded Charges, and weak Proofs, has written a Book very fit to confirm <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in their Opinions.</p>

               <p n="3">III. HIS Third Charge is, <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules the Chriſtian Religion, makes it a very mean and contemptible Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>He tells us, That <q>The Fundamental <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion is the ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Love of God in giving his own Son, his only-beloved Son, for the Redemption of Mankind.</q> But how comes this Love of God to be called a Myſtery ſtill? It was a Myſtery, or <hi>Secret,</hi> before the Revelation of the Goſpel; but ſince it was revealed, it ceaſes to be a Myſtery or Secret: unleſs a Secret diſcovered be a Secret ſtill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:64942:26"/>
                  <q>This, ſays he, our Saviour lays great ſtreſs on; That <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi> By this, one would have thought, that Chriſt had been the Son, the only begotten Son of God, before God gave him.</q> Now this is a very ambiguous way of expreſſing himſelf; for he profeſſes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt was the Son of God, nay <hi>the only begotten Son, before</hi> he gave him; but he differs from Us and from Common Senſe in this; that by <hi>the Son of God,</hi> he means God himſelf; and by <hi>before,</hi> he means from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. This is a very hard Language; for who can fancy, that <hi>the Son of God</hi> ſhould be <hi>God himſelf;</hi> and that <hi>before,</hi> ſhould ſignify Eternity? Yet this is the Senſe he puts upon it, when he ſays; <q>If <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> be true, God did not give any Son he had <hi>before;</hi> but made an excellent Man, whom he was pleaſed to call his only begotten Son.</q> When our Saviour ſays, <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, &amp;c.</hi> I deſire our Author to tell me, what is meant by the Word <hi>God,</hi> Whether the whole Trinity, or the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only? If the whole Trinity, the Senſe will come to this; The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt ſo loved the World, that they gave their only begotten Son. Which is falſe; for in the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Hypotheſis, the Son is not the Son of the Second or Third Perſons in the Trinity. If by God be meant the Father only; How comes the Father to ingroſs here the Title of God, to the Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Son and the Holy Ghoſt? How is he only ſaid, to <hi>love the World;</hi> for the Son and Holy Ghoſt love it as well as the Father? Thus they are not the <hi>Socinians,</hi> but the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> that ridicule the Chriſtian Religion, by putting on it an abſurd and unnatural Senſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But, ſays he, God's Love in giving his only-begotten Son for our Redemption, which our Saviour fixes on as the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of God's Love, is not ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful; if this giving his Son ſignifies no more, than making a Man on purpoſe to be our Saviour.</q> What then? Does it follow from thence, that the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules the Chriſtian Religion? It only follows, that the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine makes the Love of God leſs wonderful than the <hi>Trinitarian.</hi> For in it ſelf it is a wonderful Love, that God ſhould raiſe up a Saviour, to Apoſtate and Rebel Mankind; tho this Saviour was not God himſelf. But why ſhould we call a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera a more wonderful Love; for the Son of God cannot be God himſelf, and therefore God could not ſhew his Love by giving ſuch a Son. To conclude; as the Love of God in redeeming Offenders, is wonderful, be the means what they will: So his Love in giving for them his Beloved Son, tho but a Man, cannot without Impiety be denied, to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to a Miracle. The ridiculing is only on the ſide of our Author, not on the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian;</hi> and I am apt to think, that if I were not an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> already, his Book (made up of bold Charges, inconſequent Reaſonings, and arrogant Definings of what he underſtands not) would make me one.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the next place, ſays he, at <hi>pag.</hi> 239. the Apoſtles mightily inſiſt on the great Love of Chriſt in dying for us, and his great Humility in ſubmitting to the condition of Human Nature, and ſuffering a ſhameful and accurſed Death, even the Death of the Croſs.</q> He cites 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. and 5. 14. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7, 8. And goes on thus; <q>Suppoſing Chriſt to be but a meer Man, who had no being before he was born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; who knew nothing of his own coming into the World, or for what end he came; whoſe Undertaking was not his own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary choice, but God's appointment; Where is the great Love, where is the great Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this?</q> The meaning of all this is, that were not Chriſt the Supream God, whatever he has done on our behalf, would be no great Argument of his Love, or his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. If <hi>Codrus</hi> and <hi>Decius</hi> devoting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Death, for the Good of their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Countries, have been accounted by all Men, great Lovers of their Countries; Shall not Chriſt's dying for the Eternal Salvation
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64942:26"/>
of Mankind, paſs for an Argument of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Love? Is it nothing for Chriſt to lead a wandring poor and miſerable Life, to expoſe himſelf to all the Injuries and Fury of Impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Adverſaries, to undergo a painful and infamous Death; and all this to make Men partakers of everlaſting Life: Muſt all this be accounted nothing, unleſs the Perſon ſo doing be the Supream God? <hi>How did he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Poor,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who was never Rich?</hi> But I ask him, How the Supream God can <hi>become Poor;</hi> How God can <hi>make himſelf of no Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> or <hi>humble himſelf and become obedient unto Death;</hi> all which things he imputeth to a Perſon who is God? I would know, How it comes that Chriſt's Love and Humility is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by ſuch Characters, as can only be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a Man; if we muſt not be allowed to believe, that the Love of <hi>Chriſt-Man</hi> was wonderful? He inſiſts much on 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. where our Tranſlation ſays, Chriſt <hi>became Poor.</hi> But he might know, that the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does not ſignify <hi>to become Poor,</hi> but <hi>to be Poor;</hi> and ſo <hi>Caſtalio</hi> renders it. So the Senſe of that place is this; <q>Tho Chriſt was Rich and Glorious, by reaſon of the Authority and Power conferred on him: yet he was willing to lead a poor Life, that by his Poverty (as by one means) we might obtain Eternal Riches and Glory.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian explains <hi>being in the Form of God</hi> at <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. by <hi>being made Like to God,</hi> by a Communication to him of Divine and Miraculous Power over Diſeaſes, Devils, the Grave, the Winds, the Seas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this our Author replies; <q>This dwindles <hi>the Form of God</hi> into juſt nothing; for according to them, he had no power to do this, but God did it at his Word, as he did for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophets. And therefore this is no <hi>Form of God,</hi> no likeneſs at all: For Chriſt did not work Miracles as God does, by an inherent Power; but God wrought Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for him.</q> Chriſt indeed could not work Miracles by an inherent or proper Power of his own, ſince he was not God; but to conclude that therefore there was no form or likeneſs of God at all in him, is a very bad Conſequence. When we ſay, that Chriſt was in the form or likeneſs of God; we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thereby an equality with God, and we mean only, that he was in a manner like God. This may be explained by a Compariſon. It may be ſaid, that a Vice-Roy is like a King; but this does not ſignify, that he is the King himſelf, or is equal to the King; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that by reaſon of the Power and Authority conferred on him, he is in a manner like the King: So that thô he does not act by a Power of his own, yet he may be truly ſaid to act like a King. To conclude from hence, that this dwindles the likeneſs of the Vice-Roy with the King, into juſt nothing, would be meer Impertinence: for then a Porter would be as like a King as the Vice-Roy himſelf; which no Man in his Senſes will affirm. When therefore Chriſt, by the Power beſtowed upon him, caſt out Devils, cured all ſorts of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, raiſed the Dead, commanded the Winds and the Seas; He was indeed in the likeneſs of God, and it was a great Humility in him, that he was ſo far from making an oſtentation of his Glory and Greatneſs, that he became like a Servant, humbled himſelf, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went all ſorts of Sufferings, even the Death of the Croſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But, ſays the Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 241. How did he <hi>take this Form</hi> upon him, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his own free and voluntary Choice; when he did not take it, but was made ſo! What?</q> when the Apoſtle ſays, that Chriſt <hi>took upon him the Form of a Servant;</hi> muſt we ſay, that he did not? Is it not a plain Contradiction to the Apoſtle? He adds; <q>And what Humility was this, for a meer Man to be a Miniſter and Servant of God; and ſo great a Miniſter as to be in the Form of God, that is (as he ſays) to be glorious for Miracles, and admired as the great Power of God: eſpecially, when he was to be exalted unto Heaven for it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced above all Principalities and Powers? This is ſuch Humility, as would have been <hi>Pride and Ambition</hi> in the moſt, glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</q> Shall we not call Humility what St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls ſo? He tells us, that the ſame who
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64942:27"/>
has been advanced above all the Orders of Angels, humbled himſelf. All the Glory that Chriſt has been crowned with, doth not hinder the Apoſtle from praiſing and extolling his Humility. Becauſe Chriſt's Sufferings have been remunerated with a tranſcendent Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; muſt they not be accounted Humility, but <hi>Pride?</hi> On the contrary, the more that he who humbles himſelf is great and glorious, the greater is his Humility. Seeing therefore Chriſt had received from God more Glory than ever any Man had, it follows, that his Humility was the moſt ſtupendious and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd that ever was. But according to our Author's way of reaſoning, there is no ſuch thing as Chriſtian Humility. For every Chriſtian who humbles himſelf, endeavours thereby to fit himſelf for the Kingdom of Heaven: but all our beſt Actions are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be compared with that <hi>Glory which ſhall be revealed</hi> in us; and therefore will our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſay, Humility is but a Chimera, becauſe he who is ſaid to humble himſelf, expects to get by the means an Eternal Glory. Indeed if the moſt bitter Sufferings of Chriſt, are not to be accounted Humility, becauſe they were to be rewarded with a more excellent Glory: I cannot ſee, how any Chriſtians may be ſaid to be humble; for they expect a glorious and tranſcendent Reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 242. <q>After Chriſt was come into the World, there was no place (ſaith our Author) for his Choice and Election; he could not ſhew either his Love or his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, in chooſing Poverty or Death: and therefore if it was matter of his free Choice, and a Demonſtration of his great Humility and Love, as the Apoſtle ſays it was; he muſt and did chooſe it before he came into the World.</q> But all this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the place of the Apoſtle, wherein he ſpeaks only of what Chriſt has done ſince he came into the World, and does not ſo much as mention what he had done before. Which has forced ſeveral Trinitarian Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters to acknowledg, that this Text does not relate to the Incarnation. I deſire our Author to tell me the meaning of theſe words, <hi>Who being in the Form of God, thought it not Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God.</hi> For if to be <hi>in the Form of God,</hi> ſignifies, <hi>to be the true God;</hi> then the ſenſe will be this; <q>Chriſt being the true God, thought it not Robbery to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with the true God.</q> Which is juſt as if one ſhould ſay, <hi>Leopold</hi> who is Emperour does not think it Robbery to be equal with the Emperour. Is it poſſible, Men ſhould put ſuch a trifling ſenſe on the words of an Apoſtle? Beſides, how can it be ſaid here, that <hi>the Supream God made himſelf of no Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> In a word, of all the things ſpoken of Chriſt in this place, not one of them can be applied to the Supream God: which plainly ſhews, that the Man Chriſt Jeſus only did humble himſelf; and that this Humility is ſo far from proving that Chriſt is God, that it demonſtrates, he was only a Man.</p>
               <p>He goes on; <q>The Faith and Worſhip of Chriſt, is the diſtinguiſhing Character of the Chriſtian Religion.</q> That the Faith of Chriſt is the diſtinguiſhing Character of the Chriſtian Religion, I grant; but I deny, that the Worſhip of Chriſt is ſo too. I ſuppoſe, by the Worſhip of Chriſt, he means only the Worſhip of <hi>Chriſt's Divine Nature;</hi> for he tells us in the following words, that both the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Moſaical Religion <hi>condemn the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of any Creature;</hi> therefore Chriſt's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature being a Creature, ought not to be worſhipped. Of the Worſhip paid to Chriſt, I have ſaid enough already; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Author gives occaſion for it, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating his Charge of Idolatry, I will conſider what he has offered, in its proper place. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here I ſhall mind him; that the Compilers of the Apoſtles Creed have made no mention of the Worſhip of Chriſt, but only of Faith in him.</p>
               <p>At <hi>pag.</hi> 245. He goes on to prove, that the Socinian Doctrine ridicules the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; <q>Becauſe it does not aſcribe to Chriſt ſuch Knowledg as is proper to the Supream God.</q> His firſt Proof, is <hi>John</hi> 2. 25. <hi>He knew what was in Man.</hi> To which the Hiſtorian had before anſwered thus; <q>The Knowledg which the Lord Chriſt had, or now in his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64942:27"/>
State of Exaltation hath, of the Secrets of Mens Hearts, is the pure Gift of, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from God; and the <hi>Divine Word</hi> abiding on him. Rev. 1. 1. <hi>The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave to him, to ſhew unto his Servants.</hi>
                  </q> Our Author would elude the ſtrength of this Anſwer, thus; <q>This (ſaith he) is a plain abuſe of the Text and the Reaſon of it. <hi>He knew what was in Man,</hi> is the Reaſon aſſigned why he needed not external Information, or Teſtimony of Man. <hi>He needed not that any ſhould teſtify of Man,</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he himſelf <hi>knew what was in Man,</hi> and knew all Men. Which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the propriety of Words, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies an inherent Perſonal Knowledg; in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to any external Manifeſtation, and therefore to Revelation it ſelf. For he <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> knew all Men, which cannot be done by Revelation; which is particular and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional.</q> Here one may plainly ſee, what ſtrange ſhifts Men are put to, when they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Truth. Who denies that thoſe Words, <hi>He knew what was in Man,</hi> ſignify inherent Perſonal Knowledg? Can any Man know any thing but by his inherent Perſonal Knowledg? He that knows, knows <hi>with his own Mind,</hi> and therefore has an Inherent and Perſonal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. But does it follow from thence, that ſuch a Knowledg is not from Revelation? I hope it may be ſaid of a Man inlightned by Revelation, that <hi>he knows,</hi> as well as of any other? And yet thô ſuch a Man be inſpired, he has an inherent Perſonal Knowledg; for <hi>his own Mind</hi> knows <hi>inwardly</hi> what he did not know before. But <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſays our Author, <hi>he himſelf</hi> knew; which according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Words, ſignifies an inherent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Knowledg <hi>in oppoſition to Revelation.</hi> No ſurely. For then the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> was God, for he knew what the King of <hi>Syria</hi> ſpake in his Bed-chamber, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 12. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>he himſelf</hi> knew what the King of <hi>Syria</hi> ſpake: yet this was certainly by Revelation. If our Author ſhould reply, that it is well known that <hi>Eliſha</hi> was but a Prophet, and could know no ſuch thing but by Inſpiration or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. I anſwer, It is likewiſe well known, that Chriſt knew not all things, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not the Day of Judgment, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 32. therefore he could not be God, for God knows all things. Beſides, the Scripture aſſures us, that God gave to Chriſt his Revelation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 1. which proves that all his extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knowledg was derived from God. But <hi>he always knew all Men,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>which cannot be done by Revelation; which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and occaſional.</hi> Why not? God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation may be perpetual, if he pleaſes. There is no Contradiction or Impoſſibility in it. But how has he perverted the firſt Verſe of St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Revelations? The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt which God gave to him, to ſhew unto his Servants things, which muſt ſhortly come to paſs.</hi> 
                  <q>This, ſays he, doth not ſignify that this was a Revelation made to Jeſus Chriſt, but that Revelation which Chriſt made; for thô God is ſaid to give to him, it is <hi>to ſhew unto his Servants;</hi> that is, by appointment of God, Chriſt ſhewed this Revelation unto <hi>John.</hi>
                  </q> Alas, if our Author was not able to anſwer this place, he ſhould not have ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to clude it. If Chriſt made this Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe he is God, how is it ſaid <hi>to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him,</hi> which can in no ſenſe agree to him who is true God? <hi>He received it,</hi> ſays our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>to ſhew unto his Servants.</hi> But of whom can the true God receive, either Knowledg, or Authority to diſpenſe it? But here are two Arguments againſt our Author's Doctrine: 1. That God gave to Chriſt a Revelation. But he that is God can need no Revelation; becauſe himſelf knoweth all things. 2. That He is appointed to ſhew this Revelation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Which no more can agree to one who is God, than Revelation does.</p>
               <p>He concludes; that <q>He deſires a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who knows more, and in a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner.</q> But I think, 'tis fit we ſhould be contented with ſuch a Mediator, as God was pleaſed to give us.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. His laſt Charge is; that <q>Socinianiſm juſtifies, at leaſt excuſes, both Pagan and Popiſh Idolatries; at leaſt as it is taught by thoſe Men, who allow of the Worſhip of Chriſt; which it is certain too, the Chriſtian Religion teaches.</q>
               </p>

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:64942:28"/>
In anſwer hereto; I will, 1. Shew in what conſiſts the Worſhip or Honour due to Chriſt. 2. Compare this Worſhip, with the Worſhip which Pagans exhibited to their falſe Gods, and Papiſts to their Saints.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I obſerve that in the Unitarian Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, the Worſhip or Honour due to Chriſt, is not a ſupream Worſhip; ſuch as we ought to pay to God. Chriſt being a Creature, can never be worſhipped as God is. Thô he be never ſo great and glorious, a ſupream Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is proper only to Almighty God, and can never be beſtowed on any Creature. 2. As it cannot be denied, that there are divers Orders of Creatures; ſo the Honour paid to them, ought to be proportionable to their Greatneſs and Dignity. Thus, in a Kingdom thoſe, who by reaſon of their Dignity, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the common ſort of Men, deſerve a greater Reſpect and Honour than others; and the King, who is above them all, has an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour paid to him which is incommunicable to the reſt of his Subjects. By the ſame reaſon Angels, who are more excellent than Men, are worthy of greater Honour. But Chriſt, who has been exalted above both Men and Angels, ſince he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, hath a proper Worſhip due to him, which can never be given either to Angels or Men. He is God's Beloved Son <hi>by way of Excellence,</hi> all Power is given to him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, he is at the Right-hand of God, having all things put under his Feet; he deſerves therefore an Honour, ſo much greater than theirs, as he is greater. Phil. 2. 9, 10, 11. <hi>God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every Name; that at the Name of Jeſus every Knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things under the Earth; and that every Tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</hi> The Apoſtle does not ſay, that every Knee ought to bow at the Name of Jeſus, becauſe he is the Supream God; but becauſe God has exalted him above Men and Angels; becauſe he has <hi>obtained</hi> (of God) a Name above eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Name, the moſt eminent and glorious Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that ever was. This is the true ground of the Honour which is due to Chriſt. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches; and this the Unitarians profeſs to believe, and perform. 3. When we worſhip Chriſt, it is <hi>to the Glory of God the Father,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. The Honour we pay to Chriſt, is terminated in God: we worſhip him <hi>as God's Ambaſſador and Image.</hi> As he who believes in him, believes in God alſo; ſo he who honours him, honours God alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us compare the Worſhip of Chriſt (the Reader will remember, we mean not thereby a Supream Worſhip) with the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Falſe Gods among <hi>Pagans,</hi> and of Saints among Papiſts. <hi>Pagans</hi> were guilty of Idolatry; becauſe, Firſt they had no Divine Command for ſuch Worſhip: but even our Author confeſſes, there is ſuch a Command for the Worſhip of Chriſt. To worſhip Creatures without the Warrant of God, is Uſurpation on, and Contempt of God. Secondly, They worſhipped and ſerved Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>more than the Creator,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays. They ſet up an infinite number of Gods, who had been meer Men; and aſcribed to them ſuch Power as did not belong to them, and ſuch Worſhip as was infinitely above them. They offered Sacrifices to them, conſecrated Temples to their Honour, prayed to them; in a word, they paid to them ſuch Worſhip, as was <hi>terminated in them,</hi> and ſo made True Gods of Men. But it is not ſo with the Worſhip of Chriſt. We aſcribe to him no other Power, but what we know from the Scriptures God has beſtowed on him; and no other Honour but what is proportionable to that Power, to the Dignity of his Perſon, and what God himſelf commands us to pay him. This may be applied to the Papiſts. Let them ſhow us any Text of Scripture, which obliges us to worſhip St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Francis.</hi> Were they content to keep within the bounds of Reſpect and Honour, due to glorified Saints, they ſhould be guilty of no Fault. But to pray to them, as many do, as Mediators both of Interceſſion <hi>and Merit,</hi> to dedicate Churches to them, to kneel down before their Images and to their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64942:28"/>
Images, nay to their vileſt Relicks; this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches too near to Idolatry. Our Author therefore miſtakes, when he ſays; <q>The greateſt hurt <hi>(on the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Hypotheſis)</hi> ſeems to be, that they <hi>(Pagans and Papiſts)</hi> loſe their Labour, but according to theſe Principles they do no Injury to God.</q> What then? Is it all one, to worſhip Chriſt by God's Appointment, and to worſhip Falſe Gods and (Apocryphal) Saints, without any Warrant from God? Is it all one, to pay to Chriſt ſuch Honour as neither exceeds his Power, nor is greater than his Dignity, and honour Falſe Gods and Saints, in ſuch manner as exceeds both their Power and Merit? That, is Obedience to God's Will; the Other, deteſtable Uſurpation and Rebellion. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> by the Worſhip they pay to Chriſt, cannot be ſaid to juſtify or excuſe <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Which if it had not been an invidious Charge, is ſo apparently Falſe, that it would not have deſerved any notice.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with that part of the Doctor's Book, which I undertook to anſwer. It may be, the Hiſtorian himſelf might, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome Texts, and to ſome of our Author's Objections, have either explained or defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, otherways than is here done: and that we may, it ſeems, ſhortly ſee; unleſs Dr. <hi>Sherlock thinks ſit to own, that he deſires it not.</hi> In the mean time, it may be the Hiſtorian is ſatisfied; that in theſe Papers, I have done wrong neither to him, nor to the Inviolable Truth of God. God be pleaſed to Inſpire Chriſtians, with the Spirit that leads into all Truth; and with that Infallible <hi>Note of true Diſciples, to love one another,</hi> John 13. 35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now to him that is of Power, to eſtabliſh us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Goſpel, and the preaching of Jeſus Chriſt; to God only wiſe, be Glory through Jeſus Chriſt for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
