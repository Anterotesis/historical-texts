            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Morphandra,</hi> descended of the High-born <hi>Circe,</hi>
daughter of <hi>Sol,</hi> who (according to the Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy

<hi>Morphandra</hi> infusing the Faculty both of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>

unto their own <hi>Countries</hi> and <hi>Callings:
Pererius</hi> attempted to perswade them therunto,
but in regard of the rebellious Humors, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Sacriledges, the new-fangled Opinions, and
gingling Extravagances that <hi>Human</hi> brains are

again: At last Prince <hi>Pererius</hi> mingling speech

name of a Rare <hi>Female,</hi> I thought
it might well stand with the rules
of <hi>Congruity</hi> to make the <hi>Dedication</hi>
correspond with the <hi>Title;</hi> And
after many revolutions of <hi>Thoughts</hi>
who shold be most proper for my
designe, the contemplation of your <hi>Honor</hi> did cast such
strong influences upon <hi>Them,</hi> that at last <hi>They</hi> fixed
there; Nor will any <hi>Discerning</hi> Reder question my
judgment herein, your <hi>Ladiship</hi> being so able and fit
(as I have the honour to know by experience) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this <hi>Admired</hi> Queen, and give her a suitable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment;
Therfore, <hi>Madame,</hi> if you please to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<hi>Morphandra</hi> into your Closet, I believe she will
afford you severall sorts of divertisements, And <hi>she</hi>
haply may work somtimes a <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> in your
<hi>Self,</hi> for she can transmute <hi>Passions</hi> as well as <hi>Persons,
she</hi> can turn <hi>Melancholy</hi> to <hi>Mirth,</hi> and <hi>Pensivenes</hi> to
<hi>Plesure;</hi> For as it is in the <hi>French</hi> (of which Language
you are so great a Mistresse) <hi>Les Morts font revivre les
Vivants,</hi> The Dead enliven the Living, wherby is
meant; that Books, though the Authors therof be dead
<pb facs="tcp:98502:5"/>
and rotten many Ages before, can beget new spirits
in the living Reder.</p>
            <p>Now, such is the state of <hi>Mankind,</hi> that the foresaid
<hi>Passions</hi> will have their interchangable turns, they will
follow one another as duly as Night succeeds Day in
any <hi>Human</hi> Creture, be the <hi>Humors</hi> therof never so
equally poiz'd; It is denied to <hi>Man</hi> to be always at
Home within himself, and it will be so to the world's
end as long as He is compos'd of the four Elements,
and as long as the Naturall <hi>humors</hi> within <hi>Him</hi> sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize
with the said Elements, who are in restles mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and motion among themselfs for mastery,
which made one break out into this excesse of speech,
that if the four <hi>Humors</hi> were ballanc'd aright in the
<hi>human</hi> body, he wold live easily many thousands of
years upon earth; Now, that person may be said to be
the wisest among mortalls who can rule and controul
those Humors, It being a Principle among the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
That as the <hi>conduct</hi> of the <hi>Passions</hi> (which arise
from the <hi>Humors</hi>) is the greatest <hi>prudence,</hi> so the <hi>conquest</hi>

or similar, others <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> or dissimilar; And in order to
<hi>that</hi> they held, That God Almighty was the Great <hi>Soul</hi> which
did inform and actuat the whole <hi>Bulk</hi> with motion and life, with
vertu and vigor, for every part to perform its peculiar function
towards the preservation of the <hi>Whole:</hi> According to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
an Argument may be drawn by way of <hi>Induction,</hi> That if
the parts begin to impair, the <hi>Whole</hi> must be in a declining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
It hath been a Truth which hath pass'd from all times
without controul, that <hi>Mankind</hi> is one of the <hi>prime parts</hi> of the
<hi>Universe</hi> and <hi>Paramount</hi> of the <hi>Sublunary</hi> World, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable
by that <hi>Dominion</hi> which was given him over all his
fellow-Cretures in <hi>Aire, Water,</hi> or <hi>Earth;</hi> He can make the
towring <hi>Eagle</hi> stoop to his Lure from the middle Region; He can
make the vast <hi>Leviathan,</hi> though a hundred times bigger than
himself, to flounce from the deep to do him homage on the Shore;
He can make the <hi>Elephant,</hi> though forty times stronger than
himself, to draw up his Ships on the Carine, and do other drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries;
This appears also out of that <hi>Awe,</hi> which by a kind of
naturall instinct all other <hi>Animals</hi> use to shew <hi>Him;</hi> Insomuch
that tryall hath been made, how if a <hi>Man</hi> should go naked and
with a confidence through the <hi>Arabian</hi> Desarts, where the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
concours of wild Beasts useth to be, ther's none will assault him,
but in a gazing and awfull kind of posture they will keep their
distance: Now, if <hi>Man,</hi> who is so considerable a <hi>part</hi> of the
world, doth decay in his <hi>Species,</hi> 'tis a shrewd symptom that the
<hi>Whole</hi> is <hi>en decadence,</hi> in a declining state; Now, that <hi>Man</hi>
doth impair as well in his <hi>Intellectualls</hi> and the Faculties of his
Soul, as in the motions and affections of his heart, this present
Age can afford more pregnant proofs than most of the Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
For touching the <hi>First,</hi> What fond futilous new Opinions
<pb facs="tcp:98502:6"/>
have bin hatch'd of late times, both in <hi>Divinity</hi> and in the Idae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
of holy things, as well as in all other <hi>Sciences,</hi> specially in the
Art of <hi>Policy,</hi> wherin such poor <hi>Sciolists</hi> are crept up, that
wold turn antient <hi>Monarchies</hi> into new popular <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,</hi>
and so set a <hi>Hydra</hi>'s head upon an old <hi>Lion</hi>'s neck, or
make a Child's shoo to fit a Giant's foot.</p>
            <p>Touching the motions of the Heart, ther's nothing of that
love and offices of <hi>Humanity</hi> which were used to be, not onely
among private persons and neighbours, but that <hi>Allegiance</hi> and
<hi>Love</hi> which Subjects were us'd to shew towards their lawfull
Prince decaies more and more, whereof ther have been strange
examples of late years; In <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> a large antient Empire,
the common peeple did rise up with a petty Companion against
their Soveraign, and kill'd him with his two Sons in open field;
In <hi>Constantinople,</hi> two <hi>Gran Signors</hi> were thrust out of the
world by their own Slaves, yet they went not to that heighth of
Impudence as to arraign <hi>Them</hi> before a Barr of Iustice; The
<hi>Swed</hi> hath quite revolted from the <hi>Pole,</hi> the <hi>Portugues</hi> from
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and so <hi>Naples</hi> wold have done; What a huge Army
did the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Aleppo</hi> raise lately? And in the Kingdom of
<hi>Morocco</hi> a mean Fellow, under the seeming shew of Sanctity,
what a crew of riff-raff stuff did he drag after him against his
lawfull King? But touching these <hi>Northwest Ilands,</hi> they have
out-gon all the rest: These metamorphos'd Animals do point at all
these, and other degenerations of the <hi>Human</hi> Creture: Nor is it
the first time that Beasts did speak, for we read of one in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Code</hi> who spoke; and besides, <hi>Solomon</hi> sends in to som of
<hi>Them</hi> for <hi>Instruction:</hi> The <hi>Phrygian</hi> Fabler was one of the
first who taught them their <hi>Abcee,</hi> then <hi>Anian, Barlandus,</hi> and
others taught Them Their <hi>Primer,</hi> and the two ingenious <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,
Poggius</hi> and <hi>Gelli</hi> may be said to have taught <hi>Them</hi>
their <hi>Grammer:</hi> But these transmuted <hi>Beasts</hi> speak in a louder
Dialect, who having tryed both Natures, they tell the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Creture his own, and how he growes daily from bad to
worse, according to the <hi>Propheticall Lyric</hi> Poet,
<q>

                  <l>Nos nequiores, mox daturos</l>

                  <l>Will get worse than <hi>Them both:</hi> Such a sad curse</l>

               <p>Prince <hi>Pererius</hi> (for so I understand your quality and

speech, which reflects upon this <hi>place,</hi> we shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make it good by the hospitality and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
we shal command to be given You and your

But as for the second part of your speech, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to <hi>my self,</hi> and to the power of <hi>Transmutations;</hi>
I must tell you, that what I act this way, is by a special
dispensation from above, for the punishment of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
vice in an analogical or sympathetic way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the quality thereof, and the humors of the
men: I say, it is by the permission and <hi>Fiat</hi> of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
the great God of Nature, that I do operat,
not by any prestigious charmes, or confederacy with
Cacodaemons; not by fascinations or philtres, by spels
or sorceries, as the shallow-pated common people
imagine I do, and so traduce me of Witchcraft, and
Negromancy; yet, I confess, 'tis by way of Magick I
act; for <hi>Magick</hi> was the first Philosophy among those
acute Nations which are neerest the rising Sun, so that
<hi>Magus</hi> or <hi>Magitian</hi> signified nothing else but a Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which afterwards came to be traduced, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in an ill sense; As it hath been the fate of <hi>Tyrant,
Sophister,</hi> and other words besides, to incurre the same
destiny, and I pray the same destiny may not befall
the word <hi>Parlement.</hi>

               <p>Most excellent Queen, now that my Starrs have
made me so fortunat, as to conduct me hither, let it
not be held to great a presumption, if for the enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my knowledge, and satisfying my curiosity, I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98502:13"/>
humbly desire to see some of those Human Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that you have anthropomorphos'd, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
to brute Animals.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Morphandra.</speaker>
               <p>I shall willingly comply with your curiosity and
desire in this kind; for you shall not only be brought
to the sight of them, but you shall mingle speech with
them, and interrogat what you shall think fitting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their present condition.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>But, Madam, how can that be? how can I expect
that they should be capable of what I speak, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
What answers or replies shall I hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from them, while they continue in the shapes of
brute cretures?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Morphandra.</speaker>
               <p>Let that be your least care; for during that intervall
of time, I shall re-infuse into them the faculty both of
<hi>Reson</hi> and <hi>Ratiocination,</hi> whereby you may confer and
discourse freely with them by interlocutions; Nor only
so, but for a further argument of the great esteem I
have of you Prince <hi>Pererius,</hi> and for the heightning of
your welcom to my Court, as also that you may
make som reall <hi>returns</hi> of your voyage hither, if you
can induce and fairly perswade any of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assume
the shapes of Human cretures, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
again in their former condition, I shall give my
free and full assent thereunto; nay, to oblige you yet
further, I shall give way that you take them a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
with you, and transport them to their own
Country, or whither you please besides; Provided that
it be a spontaneous act, and that you have their volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
election to this effect; for the universal Law tells
us, that <hi>Volenti non fit injuria,</hi> An unforc'd will cannot
be wronged.</p>

               <p>Most admired Princess, you engage me beyond all
measure or meanes of retaliation, beyond all degrees
of gratitude, and me-thinks by these high civilities
you have wrought a sudden kind of transformation in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98502:14"/>
me, for I find my self all transformed to admiration, to
a thing of wonder, by these unparallel'd favours. All
that I can say for the present is, that, what air soever
I breath; under what climat soever blessed Heavens
shall shed their influences upon me, I shall blazon
forth your nobleness for such transcendent favors all
the world over.</p>

               <p>We use not such Complements under this Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
such a distance doth not use to be 'twixt the Heart

before you go to exchange words with these Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
take this Advertisement before-hand, that ther
are no wild or ferocious devouring cretures within
the Circumference of this Ile; they live all in a gentle
and general community, in an innocuous freedom, and
sociableness: The Panther, Bear, and Tyger, put off their
belluine fierce nature here; the Lamb will play with
the Lion without any apprehensions of fear; the Hart
fears not the Hound, nor the Hare the Greyhound, nor
the Bore the Lime-hound; the silly Sheep fear not the
Wolf or the Butcher's knife; nor Fish nor Fowl fear
here the Dragnet or Tramell: but all Animals, both of
Air, Earth, and Water, live in an innocent security;
the reason being, that we neither kill, much lesse feed
upon any Creture here that hath blood, and a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
life, but upon fruits, pulse, roots, rice, with other
nourishing and manducable things, that come forth
gently, by the general benignity of indulgent Nature,
from the bowels of our common Mother the Earth;
And though we make Butter sometimes our aliment,
we abhorre Cheese, because the cawle of a sensitive
kill'd creture serv'd for the Rennet.</p>

               <p>Oh blissful Region! Truly Madam, I am of opinion,
that this Iland is a part, or some promontory of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
it self before <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, which, being slented off,
and so got loose, was transported and fixed here; at
least, there are some grains of that mettal which went
to the composition of the Golden Age of the world
still remaining here unconsumed.</p>

               <p>Well, that I may acquit my self of the promise I
made unto you, Prince <hi>Pererius,</hi> let us fetch a walk in
those flowry fields towards the banks of that River,
to take in the freshness of the air, with the fragancy
of those Vegetals: And now, in a favourable conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of time, I spy a metamorphosed Creture among
those seggs, fit for your purpose; It is an <hi>Otter,</hi> whom
I remember to have transmuted from a Mariner or
Seaman, for his deboshments here; and I observe,
ther are no people so given to excesses as Seamen
when they come ashore; which yet may be somwhat
excused, for it is to recompence the hardships they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
at Sea: Nor was it an improper change for me
to metamorphos the <hi>Hydraulian</hi> Mariner to that shape;
for as the <hi>Otter</hi> is a kind of Amphibious creture, living
partly by water, and partly by land, so a Mariner, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigator,
or Fisherman, useth to do: but there was
another reson which induced me to this transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for it related to the quality of the Countrey
whence he sprung, which is so inlayed, and every
where so intercutt, and indented with the Sea, or fresh
navigable Rivers, that one cannot tell what to call it,
either water or land; besides, the Inhabitants dwell
so low, that they lye lower than the Sea in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And now you may make your approaches, and
parly with him accordingly, while I walk up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to visit my Nymphs.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I came first into the World in <hi>Hydraulia,</hi> not farr

               <p>Well, the most gracious Queen <hi>Morphandra</hi> hath

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>Consult better with your thoughts, for <hi>Morphandra</hi>

               <p>These civilities might haply deserve thanks from

               <p>Truly, Sir, though Man doth vaunt, and cry up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to be the Epitome and Lord Paramount among all
sublunary Cretures, though he vainly entitle himself,
the <hi>Microcosm,</hi> yet I hold him to be the most miserable
of all others; Go to his prime faculty, <hi>Reson,</hi> which,
as he saith, is the specifical difference that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
him from us, I have found, that it fills his
brain full of distraction, of extravagant opinions, and
whimseys, of pining griefs, panting doubts, and pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
fears, of violent fancies and imaginations, which
oftentimes turn to phrensies; it tortures him with
vexation and inquietude of spirit, insomuch, that som
of the profoundest Philosophers, as I have heard,
affirmed, that the <hi>Rational Soul</hi> was given to Man for
his Self-punishment and Martyrdom; he may be said
to be his own Tormentor, and the greatest Tyrant to
himself; nay, these cruciatory passions do operat
somtimes with such a violence, that they drive him to
despair, and oftentimes to murther and destroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
before Nature hath exspird her due cours in him,
all which, we, that are guided only by <hi>sense,</hi> are not
subject unto; We only look upon the present object
before our eyes, and take no other care but for shelter,
and food, and to please our appetit only.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, that all these turbulences, and perplexities
of spirit proceed from the <hi>Rational faculty;</hi> but, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
thereof, we have by this Faculty the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
to know our Creator, to contemplat his works,
and the fair fabrique of the World; by this, we have
a dominion and Empire over all other Elementary
Cretures, both of Air, Earth, and Water; by the reach
of this, Man with his crampons and harping-irons
can draw ashore the great Leviathan; He can make
the Dromedary and Camel to kneel down, and take
up his burden; He can make the fierce Bull to endure
his yoke; He can bring down the Vulture from his
nest; by this he can ride upon the back of the vast
Ocean, and with his winged Coursers ride post from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98502:16"/>
one Pole to the other, as you know well by your own
Profession, when you were Man and Mariner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Otter.</speaker>
               <p>Yet these advantages com short, in my judgment, to
countervail those calamities that are incident to the
Rational Creture, which makes him come puling, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp; sometimes weeping into the world, as foreteling
his future miseries. But now that I have partly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played
the discomposures and vexations of his mind,
I will give a touch of those infirmities that his Body
is subject unto, which is no other than a Magazin of
malignant humors; a hull, wherein is stow'd a carga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
of numberless diseases, of putrid and ugly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
insomuch that, as, in his life time, whiles he
sleeps in the <hi>bosom of his causes</hi> within the Womb,
ther's no Creture lies neerer the excrementitious
parts, so ther is none whose excrements are more fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid,
and stinking; the <hi>fewmets</hi> of a Deer, the <hi>lesses</hi> of a
Fox, the <hi>crotells</hi> of a Hare, the <hi>dung</hi> of a Horse, and the
<hi>spraints</hi> that I use to void backward, are nothing so
foetid; which may be the cause why, after Man's
death, ther's no carcase so gastly and noisom as his, so
that Toads and Serpents engender often in his scull;
nor is his cadaver good for any thing when life is gone.
'Tis tru, Mummy may be made of it, but it must be don
by embalment, and great expence of Spices. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in our carcases after death, serve for divers
uses, as particularly in mine; my Liver, reduced to
powder, is good against the Flix and Cholic; my Stones
or testicles against the Palsie; and my Skin is of such
value, that the fairest Ladies will be glad to wear
it, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>'Tis a great truth what you speak of Human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but all this comes accidentally; it proceeds from
variety of viands, esculents, and beverages, not from
the primitive plastick vertu, and ordinance of nature:
Moreover, that which makes them so subject to putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
is, because they abound in heat and humidity
more than other bodies, which oftentimes makes som
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98502:16"/>
parts of the Compositum rott, before life and motion
leaves them. But let not these thoughts avert you
from a return to your first Beeing, whereby, when this
transitory life is ended, you may be made capable to
live in the Land of Eternity; whereas all brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
whose Souls soar no higher than the <hi>sense,</hi> are
born to have a <hi>being</hi> only in this World: Therefore
take on a manly resolution to be redintegrated into
your first Principles, &amp; so return to your own Country,
and Kinred, to go on still in your <hi>Calling,</hi> which is a
useful and thriving Profession, in the practise where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

               <p>I cannot deny, but the common saying is, that <hi>He

in a storm is a Saint, but when the storm is over he is a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

               <p>Without question, to be a Mariner or Navigator, as
it is a necessary and noble Vocation, so it affords more
frequent opportunities to improve a Man's devotion to
Heven, if one makes right use of it; which cannot
be don more properly, than by comparing the frail
Vessel wherein he sayls to his own Body; If he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templat,
within the theater of his thoughts, that the

are his passions; anger, choler, and discontentments,
are the <hi>storms</hi> and <hi>tempests;</hi> his body is the bulk or

nerfs, his bowels are the <hi>ballast,</hi> his heart the principal

               <p>Truly, Sir, to deal freely with you, I am quite out of
conceit with, <hi>both:</hi> Touching the first; for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
hence thither, were to go from a fair flowry field
into a great bogg, or a kind of quagmire, for such a
thing my Countrey may be called, if you have regard
to the quality of the soil, in comparison of This: It is,
for the most part, a foggy cobwebb'd air; so canopied
over, as it were, with thick fuliginous clowds, as if it
were but one great Brew-house; they fence out both
the <hi>Aquatical</hi> Creatures from their right habitations,
and the true <hi>Prince</hi> of the Countrey from his heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
possessions; insomuch, that some do not stick to call
them double Usurpers: It is one of the most infimous
and lowest part of the terrestrial Globe; which made
one say, that they were the neerest confederats and
neighbors to <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> And this may be inferred also
out of their natures and disposition: for openly or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly,
they have blown the bellows of all the Warrs
(now <hi>Warr is a fire, struck always in the Devil's tinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box</hi>)
that have happen'd round about them, ever since
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98502:17"/>
their Revolt from <hi>Tumontia,</hi> and since they invol'd <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Gheriòna</hi> in their quarrell, who first rais'd them
to a <hi>Free-State;</hi> though I believe they have repented of
it since. Add hereunto that som do doubt, Whether
God and Nature did ever design that lump of coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
Earth for the Mansion of Mankind; for of it
self it produceth neither Bread to eat, nor Stone to
build, nor Wool or Silk to cloath him, nor Wood or
Cole, or other combustible stuff, for fuel; but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
use to fish for Fire in the Water, for (fresh)
Water in the Air, and for Air out of Foggs; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that if ever any Countrey may be call'd a Noun
<hi>Adjective,</hi> surely 'tis that, for it cannot stand by it self.
I remember, while I woar the shape of Man in that
dull Clime, me-thought my blood was like so much
Bonny-clabber within my Body, which I find now to
be more quick, spriteful, and hot; though my bloud in
<hi>statu quo nunc</hi> be observed, I confess, to be the coldest of
any <hi>Quadrupedals.</hi> Moreover, I found that <hi>Mammon</hi>
and Gain was their chiefest God, and Gold their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Idol: but for the public <hi>Religion</hi> which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
they have it but in a luke-warm degree; ther's
scarce any heat of holiness, and devotion among
most of them.</p>

               <p>I find now that you are of a tru Brutish Nature,
so to beray your own Nest, and bespatter the native
Soyl wherein you first received life. 'Tis true, ther's
no Nation that hath not their peculiar humors; but
touching those you speak of in your Countreymen,
they have many signal <hi>Vertues</hi> that make a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
for them; for they are one of the most industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
race of People upon Earth; so that the whole
Countrey may be compar'd to a Hive of Bees, or Bank
of provident Ants: They are the only Men that do
Miracles now adayes; they are those, who put boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries
to the raging Ocean, and by rare repercussions
beat back his turgid and overwhelming billows, yet
they reserve a power to command him in, at pleasure;
they are those Men, who know the true Mysteries
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98502:18"/>
of Commerce, and how to regular it so, as to bring
Trade and Policy to a Science, and <hi>certain</hi> Principles.
How much are they to be commended for their neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
Go to their Ships, they may be said to be as
cleanly as a milking-pail; in their Kitchins, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of their Utensils are as bright as the inside; ther's
never a room in their house, where so much dust may
be found as to draw the name of <hi>Slutt</hi> upon it: There
is no Countrey where there are fewer sorts of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and poor people, or where they who are poor are
better lodg'd, and provided for. 'Tis true, they are
somwhat heavy in motion, and dullish, which must be
imputed to the quality of the Clime; but this dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is recompenc'd with a grave advisedness, and
circumspection in their Counsels; with a constancy,
and perseverance afterwards, in their Actions. In
fine, they are a peeple who truly understand their
own Interest, which may be said to be the prime Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Wisdom, whereby they have fought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
from a company of Fishermen, into a High and
Mighty Common-wealth.</p>

               <p>Truly, Sir, 'tis pitty that you had not a better sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to spend your Oratory upon. Now, Sir, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my former <hi>Profession,</hi> let me tell you, that to be a
<hi>Mariner,</hi> or Tarpaling, is one of the most servile and
slavish condition of life that can be, it is the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to hardship and hazard; He was no fool, who
made a question, Whether he should number a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
'twixt the Living or the Dead, being not much
above two inches distant from death, <hi>viz.</hi> the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a rotten plank: It may be also doubted, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be a Free-man, or Prisoner, being so coop'd up
within so narrow a compass all the while. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the hardship and toylsomness of this trade, let me
tell you, that to plow, dig, delve, or thresh, are but
exercises of ease, compar'd to our labor in distress of
wether: How many times, when I went a fishing, did
I carry isicles of frost at my nose, and fingers-ends?
How oft did I eat Bisket, so mouldy, that danc'd up
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98502:18"/>
and down with ugly Maggots? How oft did I stop
my nostrils while I drunk stinking Beverage? How
oft did the stench of the Pump strike me into a swoon?
But I thank the <hi>Fates,</hi> and Queen <hi>Morphandra,</hi> I am
now in a condition that I need not fear hunger or
cold, I have a good warm Coat about me, that will
last me all my life long, without patching or mending;
which kind of fences against the injuries of Time, and
tyranny of the Meteors, indulgent <hi>Nature</hi> provides for
us sensitive Creatures, before we com into the
World: whence may be inferr'd, that She takes more
care for Our preservation than she doth of Mankinds;
Beasts, have skins, Fish have scales, Birds have fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but Man comes naked and wawling into the
World, and cloaths himself afterwards with our
spoils: Nor hath he any habitation or ready food, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
him by Nature; whereas other Animals find
the Table layed, and the Buttry open for them as soon
as they are born, and come out of the bosom of their
Causes; whence it may be concluded, that they are the
nobler Cretures.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>It is given for granted, that Man comes naked into
the World, yet he hath the mastery and command,
he hath the breaking, daunting, and disposing of all
other Cretures for his own turn, both in Air, Earth,
&amp; Water, to cloath and feed him, according to his free
election and plesure; for all other elementary Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are made for his use, and principally to that end.
Now 'tis a true Maxim, that the <hi>end</hi> is more noble
than the <hi>mediums</hi> that serve for that end, therefore in
that point ther can no comparison be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us.</p>

               <p>It is an experimental Truth, that You make use of
other Cretures to array and nourish you, but much
labor and toyl must be used, before you can bring
them to serve your turn; What a deal of work must
precede, ere the Tanner and Furrier can make our
Skins fit for your wear? What huge varieties of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98502:19"/>
must go before, ere Wheat come to be made
Bread, and Barly Drink? Ther must be ploughing,
harrowing, sowing, weeding, reaping, sheafing,
stacking, barning, threshing, winnowing, sacking,
grinding, bolting, fermenting, and baking, before
you can get a bit of Bread to keep you from starving:
What a deal of stirr must be us'd, before you can get
a Shirt on your back, or a handkercher to wipe your
noses withall? There must be <hi>planting, cutting down,
hundling, watring, rippling, braking, wingling, and heckling
of Hemp;</hi> which laberinth of labors and fatigues, we
<hi>sentiant</hi> Cretures are free from.</p>

               <p>It is without controversie tru, that Man is born to
sundry sorts of labors, but it is principally to exercise
his spirits, and the faculties of the intellect, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
him from the rust of idleness, which makes the
greatest Princes and Potentates among men to have
som <hi>manual</hi> Trade, wherewith to passe away som part
of their time. But, <hi>Otter,</hi> let us <hi>word</hi> away time no
longer; let me know positively, whether you will
make use of this singular favor, now offered you by
<hi>Morphandra,</hi> with my proposal, and advice, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assume
your former nature, wherein you may so serve
&amp; praise your Creator, that may make you capable of
<hi>Eternity.</hi> In your whole life you cannot meet with so
fair an opportunity; for I have a Ship to transport you,
and you shall be well cloth'd, and cover'd, with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodation
of all things els accordingly; therefore
take Time by the Foretop, for he is bald behind, and
you cannot take hold of him.</p>

again; therefore you do but beat the Air all this
while by your perswasions; and whereas you speak
of <hi>Eternity,</hi> it may be an Eternity of torments as well
as of bliss, I'le none of that. But one of the greatest
Peeple among Mankind, I mean the <hi>Selenians,</hi> or <hi>half-Moon-men,</hi>

                  <hi>sensitive</hi> Cretures have a better <hi>World</hi> provided for
us, after we have run out our cours here; for we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have Souls in us, and certain expressions that

               <p>Madame, I have had conference with him of both,

               <p>Madame, you will perform hereby the part of an
<hi>Angel,</hi> for I never heard of any <hi>Asse</hi> that ever spoke
(unlesse it were in Fables) but of <hi>one,</hi> and that was at
the appearance of an <hi>Angel,</hi> which was by way of

            <sp>
               <speaker>Morphandra.</speaker>
               <p>Yet I have been told, that one of your greatest Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
<hi>Ammonius Alexandrinus,</hi> whose Disciple
<hi>Origen</hi> was, hath it upon record, That an <hi>Asse</hi> was
once an Auditor of Wisdom. But touching that <hi>Asse</hi>

               <speaker>Morphandra.</speaker>
               <p>The more is the foolishnesse of men discover'd in
this point, who somtimes out of a pride, malice, or
envy, somtimes out of a meer litigious humour, use
to exhaust their estates, and impoverish themselfs,
to enrich others by this means; As I remember to
have heard a facetious passage of a wealthy Lawyer,
who having built a fair Palace of Free-stone, with
Marble intermix'd, and having invited a knowing
friend of his to take a view of the new house, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the symmetry, proportion, &amp; conveniencies of the
fabric, He asked his friend at last, what he thought
that House was built of? He answered, I see 'tis
built of good Free-stone and Marble, The Lawyer
replied, No, Sir, 'tis a <hi>deceptio visûs</hi> in you, for this
house is made of <hi>Asses heads</hi> and <hi>Fools sculls,</hi> meaning
the multitude of Clients he had had. To such the
proverb may sometimes be applied, that as the <hi>Asse
oftentimes carries gold on his back, yet feeds on thistles,</hi> so
many poor Clients carry gold in their pockets to
feed their Lawyers, yet they fare hard themselfs, and
are ready to famish. But to leave off these imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences,
you may please to go on in the pursute of your
enterprise, to try whether yonder long-ear'd meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos'd
Animal will bring your intent home to
your aim, and turn <hi>Man.</hi>

I need it not; for I thank the <hi>Fates,</hi> and Queen
<hi>Morphandra,</hi> I enjoy my self, and the common benefits
of nature, <hi>viz.</hi> Air, Earth, and Water, which are
the staple commodities of all sublunary cretures, I
say, I enjoy all these more than ever I did, <hi>Fenell</hi>
excepted, which is my onely enemy. 'Tis tru, I was
once a <hi>Man,</hi> an <hi>Artonian</hi> born, my profession was
both a Vineyard-man, and a Roturer, a poor Peasan
I was, who for all my labour and toil, could hardly
gain what could bear up the two columns of life in
me, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Radicall moysture</hi> and <hi>Naturall heat,</hi> much
lesse to maintain my wife and family in any vigor.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>How could that be in so rich and plentifull a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
as <hi>Artonia</hi> is known to be? where, according to
her name, <hi>Ceres</hi> is said to have her chief Granary,
and <hi>Bacchus</hi> his prime Cellars; where <hi>Neptune</hi> hath
also his principle Salt-pits, and whence <hi>Venus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
useth to fetch her smocks?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Asse.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis granted, that <hi>Artonia</hi> in fecundity and self-sufficiency,
yields to no other Region under the Sun,
which makes some call her a <hi>Noun substantive,</hi> that
can stand by it self; yet it may well be said, that ther's
is no Country under the cope of Heaven, where
there's <hi>lesse want,</hi> and <hi>more beggars,</hi> or <hi>more people,</hi> and
<hi>fewer men;</hi> The reson of the first, to my grief I speak
it, is, that the common stock and wealth of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is by Mal-administration so unequally propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
and distributed among the Native Inhabitants
thereof; for the <hi>Court</hi> and the <hi>Clergy</hi> suck the greatest
part of the fat, whence grew the Proverb, <hi>What the
Cheque takes not, the Church takes.</hi> I speak not this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I repine at any acts of <hi>piety</hi> towards the holy
and decent worship of God Almighty, and Legacies
left by sweet devoted souls. Touching the first, 'tis too
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98502:21"/>
well known, that the very <hi>Tallies,</hi> besides the <hi>Demeans</hi>
of the Crown, and the <hi>Customs,</hi> amount <hi>communibus
annis</hi> to near upon twenty millions of Crowns, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
'tis tru, that about four millions were remitted in
the year 1648. Then the Gabell of <hi>Salt</hi> amounts to
about seven millions every year, which is look'd unto
so narrowly, that a poor Peasan cannot carry a poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
or purse-full of salt home to his poor wife, but
he must be searched. Then ther are the <hi>Taillons, Aydes,
Droits,</hi> with divers other Impositions and Taxes,
which though at first they were pretended to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
for the present necessity of the times, yet Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Princes are known to have the gift of making
Temporary things Eternall in this kind; Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
if this immense tresure went to the King's tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
alone, for the common defence and honour of
the State, it would not so much trouble them that pay
it; but three parts of four are drunk up among hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Officers, whence grew the proverb, that <hi>the King's
cheese goes away three parts in parings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the second, by a late computation that
was made, the <hi>Clergy</hi> hath in annuall Revenue a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and six millions of Crowns, and no wonder, ther
being in that Country, besides <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and fifteen
<hi>Archbishops,</hi> a hundred and fifty Suffragan <hi>Bishops,</hi> and
I know not how many fat <hi>Abbots,</hi> with other Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,
Monks, and Monasteries without number.</p>
               <p>Then comes in the <hi>Noblesse,</hi> or Gentry, which have
all the rest; Insomuch that betwixt these three, the
poor Commoner, who yet makes up the bulk of the
Nation, useth to be grinded as betwixt so many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones,
whence grew this saying, that the <hi>Artonian
Peasans are born with Chains:</hi> Yet they are the suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of all the other three, and whence they have their
subsistence; Insomuch that <hi>Artonia</hi> may be compar'd
to a stately Palace, born up by mud-pillars; While
the poor toyling peasan melts the hoar frost with the
sweat that trickles down his cheeks, others by good
fire-sides drink carowses in the wine which he plants,
while he with his panting breath and anhelation
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98502:22"/>
thickens the air befor him, others with Carrolls and
wanton musicall Catches do attenuat it.</p>
               <p>Concerning the second point I spoke of, <hi>viz.</hi> That
no Country hath <hi>more peeple and fewer men</hi> then <hi>Arto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
'tis a truth too well known; and the reson is, that
the oppressed <hi>Commons</hi> do so languish and groan under
the insupportable burdens of the foresaid <hi>Exactions,</hi>
and heavy <hi>Rents</hi> besides to their Landlords, that they
use to grow so dejected, pusillanimous, and heartless,
their spirits come to be so cowed and cowardiz'd,
that not one in twenty hath the courage of a man in
him, or is found fit to shoulder a Musket, to trail a
Pike, or perform any other military or manly service.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis an apparent truth, that the <hi>Artonian</hi> Gentry
are so numerous, and use to rack the Peasantry so,
that it makes them very abject and heartlesse; for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Politicall</hi> body may be faid to be like the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall;</hi>
wherein if the blood and spirits were drawn all
up into the upper parts, the supporting members be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
as the legs and thighs, cannot have that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of naturall heat and vigor to quicken themselfs,
the blood being all engross'd by the parts above. If
the <hi>Standells</hi> be planted too thick in a <hi>Coppice,</hi> ther
cannot be clean <hi>Underwoods,</hi> for they will turn all to
dwarfish <hi>Shrubs.</hi> But the common peeple of <hi>Artonia</hi>
may thank their own volatil humors and nature for
this, which is so instable, and still so covetous of
change, that if they were fed high, and pamper'd
with too much plenty, they wold ever and anon rush
into civill commotions and tintamarrs, they wold
winch, and go about to shake off the reins of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and overthrow their Rider; Therfore being so
fiery-mouth'd, 'tis fit they should be ridden with a
bitt or curb, nor can it be tearm'd Tyranny, or any
Soloecism in Government, that they are us'd so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Asse.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, under favour you put the saddle on the wrong
horse 'tis not the <hi>Commonalty,</hi> but the <hi>Gentry,</hi> and they
who are in high blood, that have such tumultuous
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98502:22"/>
boyling spirits within them, they are those who cause
feavers and convulsions in the bowells of their own
Country, which I confesse are frequent, whence
som observe, that though the air of <hi>Artonia</hi> be not so
hot as that of her next neighbour <hi>Tumontia,</hi> yet she is
more subject to distempers, Calentures, and <hi>Tovardil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lios;</hi>
Therefore 'tis one of the prime policies of <hi>Artonia</hi>
to find her Gentry some work abroad, and employ
them ever and anon in forraign Warrs; And ther
have been of late two fiery <hi>Flamines,</hi> one after the
other, who have put this policy in practise to some
purpose, their sanguin humors symbolizing with the
colour of their habit, wherby nere upon a million of
souls have perished within these few years. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the second of these, his father little dreamt when
he sold <hi>hatts</hi> in <hi>Silicia,</hi> that his son should mount so
high as to wear the <hi>Red-corner'd Cap,</hi> and give the Law
to all <hi>Artonia;</hi> wherby some hold it to be no small
disparagement to so gallant a Nation, and subtle a
Clime as <hi>Artonia</hi> is known to be, to have none of her
own children that had brain enough to sit at the helm
of her Government, but to suffer a <hi>Forrener</hi> to lead all
her Nobles by the nose, as also to incorporat his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily

               <p>Well, let us leave these digressions, for as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
runs in your country, <hi>We have leapt from the Cock
to the Asse all this while,</hi> we have gone astray from the
matter, let's return to the first subject of our discours,
and to my main design; Poor long-ear'd patient beast,
wilt thou shake off this thy il-favoured <hi>braying</hi> nature,
and the species of a <hi>brute,</hi> to becom perfect <hi>Man</hi> again?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Asse.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, though I were acertain'd to be one of <hi>Artonia's
Peers,</hi> I wold not do it; But, Sir, touching my <hi>Ears,</hi>
you need not take me by them in so reproachfull a
manner: for you know a <hi>Phrygian King</hi> did wear once
an <hi>Asse</hi> his ears, and he was the richest that ever was
among Mortalls; Besides, my <hi>Ears</hi> have a prophetic
vertu, for when I prick them up, 'tis an infallible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98502:23"/>
of foul wether; Touching my <hi>braying,</hi> it is the
tone which Nature hath given me, and all the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidualls
of my kind, and you must grant, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the handmaid of God Almighty doth not use to
do any thing ill-favouredly; But in lieu of our <hi>braying</hi>
you have a passion, and as I remember your Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
call it the <hi>proper passion</hi> of man, that is a far
more distorting and ridiculous violent posture, 'tis
your <hi>Laughter,</hi> which happens when your pleasure
hath the liberty to scatter it self abroad, and that the
senses bear a share therin, for then it causeth such an
agitation, that the whole physiognomy of the face is
changed, it begins to sparkle in the eyes, and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it self oft-times with forc'd tears, the fore-head
stretcheth it self, the lips grow redd, they tremble
and slaver often-times, the voice becomes grosser then
ordinary, and resounds, the rest of the body is subject
to this agitation, an unusuall heat and vapor shedds
it self through all its parts, which swells, and gives
a new color, the eye-brows decline, the lidds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
themselves, and all the skin about them becomes
uneven, and wrinkles it self all over, the eyes exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuat,
they half shut themselfs, and grow humid, the
nose crumples up, and growes sharp, the lipps retire
and lengthen, ther is an ill-favor'd kind of gaping,
and discovery of the teeth, the cheeks lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs
and grow more stiff, they have pitts digg'd in
them during the time, the mouth is forc'd to open,
and discovers the tremblings of the suspended toung,
it thrusts out an obstreperous interrupted sound, and
oftentimes ther is a stopping of breath, the neck swells
and shortens it self, all the veins grow greter, and
extended, an extraordinary hue disperseth it self over
all the face, which grows reddish, the brest is impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously
agitated, and with sudden reiterated shakes,
that it hinders respiration, the perfect use of speech
is lost, and it is impossible to swallow during the fit,
a pain rises in the flanck, the whole body bends, and
as it were wreaths and gathers it self together, the
hands are set on the sides, and presse them forcibly,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98502:23"/>
sweat gets up on the face, the voice is lost in hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kocks,
and the breath is stifled with sighs; somtimes
this agitation gets to so high an excesse, that it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the same violent effect as medicaments use to do,
which is to put the bones so out of joynt that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
syncopes; The head and the arms suffer the
same throws, with the brest and the thighs, the body
hurles it self with precipitation and disorder, and is
cast from one side to the other; The hands becom
feeble, the leggs cannot support themselves, and the
body is constrained to fall, and tumble, nay it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
sometimes dangerous syncopes in the heart, and
so brings death. <hi>Weeping</hi> also the counter-passion hath
many of these ill-favor'd motions, what an odd kind of
face doth an infant make assoon as he is born? how som
of ripe age will screech, cry and howle in so many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
notes, and singultient accents? Whereas we
by our <hi>braying</hi> hold up our heads only, and so breath
out our passions into the open aire, without any
forc'd tones, or such variety of distorted postures.</p>

               <p>'Tis tru, that <hi>Laughter</hi> produceth sundry motions
and pleasing violences in the human body, but they
are recompenced by the joy that accompanieth it,
which useth to rowse and raise up our slumbring spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and melancholly thoughts with an unusuall
mirth and complaceny, whence it comes, that after
those two, Doctor <hi>Diet,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Quiet,</hi> Doctor
<hi>Merriman</hi> is requisit to preserve health; Touching
the other passion <hi>Sorrow,</hi> and the various emissions
of it, it is an ease also to the spirits, which without
such ventings would be subject to strangulations;

you any thing of the perturbations of the brain, and
the inward agonies of the mind, which did trouble
and torment me much more; How was I perpetually
vex'd not onely to pay the common Taxes, and other
pecuniary erogations, with my domineering Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords
Rents, but to find daily bread, sustenance, and
cloathing for my wife and children; Now <hi>children</hi> is

'Tis tru, touching our off-springs while they

on the face, and almost dasht out his brains;
Or thou wilt be as foolish as the <hi>Asse,</hi> who seeing a
Spaniell sawn upon his Master, and getting into his

too, but instead of being <hi>stroked,</hi> he was <hi>struck</hi> and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinadoed

               <p>Whereas you speak of fiercenesse, truly Sir I think
ther's no Animal so fierce and ferocious, so savage
and intractable as <hi>Man:</hi> for whereas all other cretures
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98502:25"/>
can be rul'd, daunted, and broken, easily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
in time, the Art of governing <hi>Men</hi> is the most
difficult of any, because of their various fancies and
imaginations, their crosse-grain'd humors and pride,
all which proceeds from the faculty of <hi>Reson</hi> you
speak of; Therefore I was very glad to be rid of it by
this transfiguration, and the time seems tedious unto
me that I have the use of it now so long to parly with
you, for I remember when I was a <hi>Man,</hi> it fill'd the
cells of my brain ever and anon with turbid and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
cogitations, with strange chimera's and
crochets, which disquieted the tranquillity and calm
of my mind; And as for my <hi>Body,</hi> this shape which I
now bear is more healthfull farr and neat, for now I
am not subject to breed <hi>Lice</hi> and other Vermin; And
whereas this pedicular disease, with a nomberlesse
sort of other maladies and distempers, attend
Mankind, ther's but one onely disease that our Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
is subject unto, which the <hi>Veterenarians</hi> or Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
call <hi>Malila,</hi> and that is onely in the head, when
som unusuall defluxion of rheume falls thence into
the nostrills, which being stopp'd turns to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of health, but if once it falls upon the
lungs we are gone: And observable it is, that being
dead, we have cleaner carcases than <hi>Men,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
medicinall things are found in them, as our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Hoofs, or Bones being reduc'd to powder are
good, as the Naturalists note, against the Epilepsy
or Comitiall sicknesse, with other diseases; Nor do
any crawling nasty worms grow out of our Cadavers,
but Beetles, and other airy Insects, which are not so
noisome; But I have spent too much time with you,

of our <hi>Species,</hi> for we do not eat or drink but
when we are a thirst or hungry, for the restauration

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98502:27"/>
kind of <hi>Vertigo</hi> that reigns amongst them, which turns
the head round, and fills it with new chimera's ever

observ'd to be inconstant in the fashion of their cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

and then multiplying amongst them; For though my

this apish humor had seiz'd strongly upon me, which
made me distrub the peace of the holy Church wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I was born, baptized, and bred, which made Queen

               <p>I know well that there was in <hi>Gheriona</hi> a comely
face of a Church; Ther were such solemnities, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and decencies us'd, that might discover som
piety in the practice of holy duties; Ther was a public
Liturgy that link'd the souls of the whole Nation in
an unanimity, wherin ther were such pithy patheticall
prayers that reached all occasions, and searched every
crany in the conscience; The Sacraments were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
with a fitting posture of reverence, and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion,
yet far from any superstition; God's houses
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98502:27"/>
were kept neat, cleanly, and in repair; There was
such a prudent handsom Government, such degrees
of promotion, such possessions annex'd to the Church,
that made them of that holy function not onely to be
esteem'd and reverenc'd, but to be able to do deeds of
charity; But now I hear ther's crept up such a nasty
race of miscreants, who have no more esteem of God
Almighty's House than of a Pig-sty, who have turn'd
a pretended <hi>Superstition</hi> to a palpable <hi>Prophanenes,</hi>
who have plunder'd all that belong'd to pious uses,
who have nothing of that veneration, that sweetnes,
and comfort that useth to attend tru devotion, which
is turn'd to a giddy zeal, or a kind of <hi>lust</hi> still after
more learning, as if <hi>Christianity</hi> had no consistence or
certainty, no sobriety; or end of knowledg, wherin
the inward man might acquiesce; These poor simple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
pretending to imitate the Apostles time wold
have the same form of Discipline and Mode to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
whole Nations, as it did at first a Chamber-full
of men in the Infancy of the Christian Church; They
wold mak the same coat serve our Saviour at five and
twenty years, as fitted him at five: But you were

may serve to regulat the future; I took notice of a
world of examples that the two nefandous crimes of

some signall judgments; Among divers other these
two do reign and rage in <hi>Gheriona</hi> more then they ever

must she not then expect the vialls of a just vengeance

me gently and softly all along untill I came to <hi>Pluto</hi>'s

and facilitated for his hearing before hand by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<hi>Committee</hi> appointed of purpose for that end
(whence I observed, that Committees were first
hatch'd in Hell) The three gastly Daughters of Night
appeered with fiery conntenances before the <hi>Stygian
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98502:28"/>
King,</hi> in lieu of <hi>air</hi> they evaporated huge flakes of
<hi>fire</hi> which they took in, and let out with the accents
of their words, huge bunches of Vipers hung dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and wavring about their heads, having their tayls
rooted in their sculls; A furious clash fell betwixt
them who should be Prolocutrix, but in regard that
<hi>Alecto</hi> and <hi>Tisyphone</hi> had given account of their former
missions, the one of the <hi>League in Artonia,</hi> the other
of the <hi>Revolt of the Hydraulian,</hi> which was about the
appearance of the Comet in the tayl of <hi>Cassiopaea,</hi> it
came now in due turn that <hi>Megaera</hi> should have the
priority of speech; So the youngest of the Tartarean
girls began as followeth.</p>
               <p>May it please your high phlegetontic Majesty to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that since the last happy Comet <hi>Anno</hi> 1618.
which by the parallax was found to be in the Heven
it self above the Elementary world, we have for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years together been more active and eager in your
Majesty's service than ever we were; We have stirred
the humors of the foolish Inhabitants of the earth to
insurrections, to warr and praeliation; To effect which,
our practise hath been to bring on the beggarliest and
toughest peeple upon the nicest and softest, we brought
the <hi>Cuprinian</hi> upon the <hi>Aetonian,</hi> and the <hi>Zoundanian,</hi>
the <hi>Tarragon,</hi> and <hi>Cinqfoyl</hi> upon the <hi>Tumontian,</hi> the
<hi>Tartar</hi> upon the <hi>Chinois,</hi> the <hi>Selenian</hi> upon the <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polist,</hi>
the <hi>Cosaque</hi> upon the <hi>Pole,</hi> the <hi>Carboneian</hi> upon
the <hi>Gherionian;</hi> We have continued a bloody lingring
Warr in the bowells of <hi>Artonia</hi> for thirty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
we have thrust divers Princes out of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Inheritances, among others the Duke of <hi>Laroni</hi>
and <hi>Rhinarchos,</hi> we brought two gran <hi>Selenian</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
to be strangled by their own slaves, we have
often puzzled <hi>Vinalia,</hi> we have made the Kings of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia</hi>
and <hi>Tumontia</hi> to bandy so fiercely one against the
other, as if the one had been an <hi>Infidell</hi> the other a
<hi>Iew,</hi> though each of them had one another's sister abed
with him every night. But may it please your Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontic
Majesty to be inform'd, that the most advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
and signall services we have done, have bin in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98502:29"/>
the lsles of <hi>Gheriona</hi> and <hi>Hebrinia,</hi> for whereas we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
our selfs before, and went singly among other
peeple, we went joyntly thither all three, and brought
a Regiment of fiery red-coated <hi>Cacodaemons</hi> to guard
us, because we might be sure to bring our great work
home to your Majesty's aime; The Nation fittest for
our turn at first were the <hi>Carboncian,</hi> who have bin so
obedient to their Kings, that of above a hundred they
brag of, scarce two parts of three died in their
beds, but were made away violently; We did incite
them first against their own Country-man and <hi>Native
King,</hi> and to appear in a daring high hostile manner
before him upon the borders; At which time it cost
us a great deal of artifice so to besot the <hi>Gherioniams,</hi>
and to abase their courage, so to entangle them with
Factions, having sure Confidents to that end among
them, that they durst not present Battle to the <hi>Carbon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
at that time; And this, Sir, was an important
piece of service, for had they fought then, or had they
bin sensible afterwards of the dishonour they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at that time, their King being then amongst them
in person, with the flower of his Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and consequently had they stuck to him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to have vindicated that rebellious affront, all
those we have fomented since might have bin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
               <p>We shortly after transmitted the same spirit of
Insurrection into <hi>Hebrinia,</hi> who being encouraged by
the good successes of the <hi>Carboneian,</hi> who got then
what tearms he listed, yet could he not sit quiet;
and the <hi>Hebrinian</hi> Commissioners being but harshly
entertain'd by the great Councell of <hi>Gheriona,</hi> who
intended to send them over a Governour that should
pinch them more than they were before in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and for divers other provocations, we caus'd
the <hi>Hebrinian</hi> also to rise in blood, which he did to
som purpose; Then came we to work upon the <hi>Ghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionian,</hi>
whom we found as fit to receive our impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as flax is to receive fire, in regard of their long
Furseit of peace and plenty; We broke up one great
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98502:29"/>
Assembly upon a suddain, because the members ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were not for our turn, But then we call'd another
which was fit for our purpose, and we steer'd their
courses all the while with a great deal of care; The
first thing we did was to endue them with a faculty
to <hi>create</hi> fears and jealousies, whereof we made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
use, and although those fears and jealousies
appeared afterwards to every common man as plain
as the nose on his face to be but meer forgeries, and
supposititious things, yet we did still so intoxicat
their intellectualls, that we made them to adore still
the <hi>coyners</hi> of them; And to give your <hi>Stygian</hi> Majesty
among divers others, one most pregnant and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
demonstration what firm footing we got in that
<hi>Island,</hi> we did raise in few years more <hi>Pythonesses,</hi>
which the ignorant vulgar call Witches there, then
ever were in that Country since your Majesty temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Eve;</hi> and we enabled our said <hi>Pythonesses</hi> to send
their inferiour <hi>Imps</hi> abroad upon our service; We
stood at the King's elbow when he pass'd the <hi>Act of
continuance,</hi> wherein a <hi>Carboncian</hi> was our chief En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer;
But the great City <hi>Polihaima</hi> stood us in most
excellent steed to compasse our designes, we made the
riffraff and rakehells of that wanton City, whom som
call'd <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> others their <hi>Bandogs,</hi> to rabble the
King out of Town, we brought also thither the silly
Swains of the Country like a flock of Geese to gaggle
up and down the streets with papers in their hats they
knew not about what; We managed the businesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
so dextrously, and did aggravate things by
degrees, that we made their credulous King, because
he was so profess'd an enemy to your Majesty, to go
disguis'd in serving-man's habit to his Country-men
the <hi>Carboncians,</hi> with whom we prevail'd so far, that
they delivered him over as a Sacrifice, and betraid
him <hi>Iudas</hi> like to the <hi>Gherionians,</hi> who crucified him
sufficiently afterwards by tossing and tumbling him
up and down, by depriving him of the comfort of all
things that use to be dear unto man, as his wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
friends, and servants, by working upon his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98502:30"/>
conscience in a compulsatory way, and stretching it
upon the very tenter; In summe, we have reduc'd
that Country to a conformity with this of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties,
to a perfect Chaos of all confusion, we have
brought the sway into the common peeples hands,
making all the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> to crouch and
cringe unto them; And never did common peeple
more truly act the part, and discover the genius of a
common peeple more lively, whose nature is still
thirsting after novelties, and <hi>Utopian</hi> Reformations,
though oftentimes they fool themself thereby into a
a baser kind of slavery, finding when 'tis too late those
specious idaea's, and confus'd forms of Government
they apprehended at first, and hugg'd in their own
conceits, to be at last but meer absurdities, when they
com to the application and practise therof.</p>
               <p>And, Sir, the most advantageous instruments we
have us'd to bring all this about have bin the <hi>Pulpit</hi>
and the <hi>Presse,</hi> by these we diffus'd those supposititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fears and jealousies, formerly spoken of, to distract
the brains of the silly vulgar; Instead of <hi>Lights</hi> we put
<hi>Firebrands</hi> in their Churches, who, according as we
did dictat unto them, did baul out nothing but sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
war, and blood; We have made som of them
to have as good an opinion of the <hi>Alchoran</hi> as
of their own <hi>Liturgy;</hi> We made new <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
to batter down all the antient <hi>Canons</hi> of the
Church, we have made them to un-saint all those
who were call'd <hi>Apostles,</hi> to prophane and plunder all
places that were consecrated, we brought som of
them to put a division 'twixt the <hi>Trinity</hi> it self, we
have brought them to keep their <hi>Fasts</hi> more solemnly
than the <hi>Sabboth,</hi> upon which day we made them usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
not onely to sit in Councell, but to put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
their chief designs of blood; To work all this,
the main and most materiall thing we made use of
was <hi>spirituall pride</hi> your Majesty's old acquaintance,
which pride we have infus'd into the mind of every
Mechanic, or Country-Swain, who will boldly now
undertake to expound any Text of Scripture new or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98502:30"/>
old upon the warrant of his own giddy brain; Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that we have made that Book which they call
the <hi>Bible,</hi> that was ordained for the Charter of their
<hi>Salvation,</hi> to be the chiefest instrument of their <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
We have brought those exotic words <hi>Plundring</hi>
and <hi>Storming,</hi> and that once abominable word <hi>Excise</hi>
to be now familiar among them, they are all made
free Denizens, and naturaliz'd among them; We have
made those who came petitioners for <hi>peace</hi> to the great
Councill to be ill intreated, and som of them to be
murther'd, but those that came for <hi>warr</hi> to be
countenanc'd and thank'd; We made the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to betray her child, the child the father,
the husband the wife, and the servant his master;
We have brought a perfect Tyranny over their
souls and bodies, upon the one, by tedious imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and captivity, with a forfeiture of all their
livelihoods before conviction, or any preceding charge,
upon the other, by forcing them to take contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Oaths, Engagements,</hi> and <hi>Protestations;</hi> On that fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
superstitious day of <hi>Christmas,</hi> with other Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
we have brought them to shut up their Churches,
and to open their Shops and Shambles, so that in time
they will forget the very memory of the <hi>Incarnation</hi>
of their Saviour; We have brought them to have as
little reverence of their <hi>Temples</hi> as of their <hi>Tap-houses,</hi>
and to hold the Church to be no more than a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell-house
of rotten bones; And though they still
cringe and stand bare-headed before any wrangling
Bench of common pleading, yet we have so stiffned
their joynts, and made their heads so tender in that
which they call God's House, that there, they can
neither bow the one, nor scarce uncover the other;
We have made the fundamentall Laws to be call'd
but <hi>meer formalities;</hi> We have made that which was
call'd their Great Charter to be torn to a thousand
flitters, and stretcht the <hi>priviledge</hi> of the Commons
so wide, that it hath quite swallowed the Royall <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,</hi>
and all other priviledges; We have grub'd
up, and cast away those hopefull Plants that grew in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98502:31"/>
their <hi>two Seminaeries</hi> of Learning, and set in them
graffs of our own choice; We have made the wealth
of Town and Country, of Poor and Rich, to shine in
plunder upon the Souldiers backs; We have made
them command <hi>free-quarter</hi> of those, that were more
sitting to ask <hi>alms</hi> of them; We have made them rifle
the Monuments of the dead, to rob the very Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retro,
to strip the Orphan and Widow; We have
made them offer violence to the very Vegetables and
inanimat Stones, to violat any thing that was held
holy, to make Socks of Surplices, to water their beasts
at the Font, and feed them on the Altar, and to term
the thing they cal the Sacrament to be but a two-penny
Ordinary; We have made them use on the close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole
that Book wherein the public Devotion of the
whole Nation consisted; In fine, we have made them
turn supposed superstition to gross prophaness, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to prating, praying to raving, government to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and freedom to fetters; We have so intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that dear daughter of yours <hi>Polihaima,</hi> that she
knows not what way to turn her self; And whereas
her Apprentices did rise up like so many Cubs of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
against their lawfull Prince, they are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com
as came as so many silly sheep against the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery;
We have puzzled their Pericranium with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiginous
fancies, and fears among themselfs, that one
neighbour dare not trust the other; To conclude, we
have eclipsed the glory of that Nation, we have made
them by all peeple far and neer that ever had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
correspondence, or any commerce with them,
to be pittied by som, to be laugh'd at by others, to be
scorn'd of all, and to becom the very tail of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
In fine, Sir, we have brought that Country to
such a passe of confusion, that it is a fit place onely for
your infernall Majesty to keep your Court in, for
ther's never a <hi>Crosse</hi> there to fright you now: 'Tis tru
they retain it still upon their coines of gold and silver,
in honour of your <hi>Plutonian</hi> Highnesse as you are <hi>Dis</hi>
and god of riches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Megaera</hi> having thus given up an account in behalf
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98502:31"/>
of her self and her two sisters, they all bowed their
snaky heads down to their very feet, which were toed
with Scorpions, before the black Throne of <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub,</hi>
who giving such a humm that made all Hell to
tremble, answered thus,</p>
               <p>My pretious and most trusty <hi>Tartarean</hi> daughters,
we highly approve of the super-erogatory service you
have don us for the propagation of our Empire upon
Earth, and specially in <hi>Gheriona;</hi> we have sued a long
time to have a lease of that <hi>Iland,</hi> and we hope to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, touching <hi>Carboncia</hi> 'tis not worth the while;
Therfore when you have visited those of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom you have sent hither already to peeple this
pit, I would have you return thither, and prepare
that place for one of our principall habitations, never
leave them till you have thrust out <hi>Religionem ex solo</hi>
as well as <hi>Regem ex solio;</hi> make Law, Religion, Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
and every thing els <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> let not one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
last long, but shuffle the Cards so that a
new Trump may be turnd up often, create still new
fears, and foment fresh divisions among them; let the
son seek the fathers throat, let brothers sheath their
swords in one anothers bowells, let the Country clash
with the Towns, the Towns one against the other,
and the Sea with both, till that the whole Nation be
at last extinguished that one may not be left to pisse
against a wall; Let not a Church or Chappell, Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
or Colledge stand in the whole Isle. I intend to
have a new Almanack of Saints at my comming, for
I have som Star-gazers there fit for my purpose; Make
haste therefore, and acquit your selfs of your duty
for fear a peace be shuffl'd up, and that <hi>Artonia</hi> and
<hi>Tumontia</hi> appeer in the busines, and espouse the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
of young <hi>Caroloman;</hi> And if you carry your selfs
well in this employment, I may chance give you <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boncia</hi>
for your reward.</p>
               <p>The three <hi>Lethean</hi> Futies with a most profound
reverence replied, May it please your Majesty, your
Ferriman <hi>Charon</hi> is continually so pestered with such
multitudes of <hi>Gherionian</hi> and <hi>Carboncian</hi> passengers,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98502:32"/>
that we were forc'd to stay a long time ere we could
be transported hither, and we fear we shall be so hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
again. Therfore we most humbly desire for our
better expedition, that you would vouchsafe to give
us a speciall <hi>Mandamus</hi> that we may be serv'd first,
with a <hi>non obstante,</hi> when we com to the banks of
<hi>Styx.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You shall dear daughters, said <hi>Pluto,</hi> and my War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
shall be addrest to som <hi>Gherionian Tarpalins,</hi>
wherof ther are abundance these few years past,
whom <hi>Charon</hi> hath entertaind for his journey-men.</p>
               <p>Having listned all this while unto what pass'd
'twixt <hi>Pluto</hi> and his Furies, my guiding spirit did lead
me up and down Hell to see the various sorts of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are there, which indeed are innumerable
both old and new; The first I beheld was <hi>Ixion</hi> who
was tyed with ugly Vipers to a wheel that whirl'd
about perpetually, and I might perceive a multitude
of lesser wheels newly made therabouts, wherunto
great nombers of <hi>Gherionians,</hi> and divers of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintants
were bound in like manner; I might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
also hard by a huge company of new <hi>Windmills,</hi>
and bodies tyed with black-spotted Snakes at every
wing turning round perpetually; A little further
ther were a great many broken by <hi>Milstones</hi> who were
whirl'd with them about incessantly; In another place
I might see black <hi>Whirlpools</hi> full of tormented souls
turning still round, I asked what was the reson of so
many whirling tortures? My good Spirit answered,
All these, except <hi>Ixion</hi>'s wheel, are new torments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for <hi>Gherionian</hi> Sectaries, who had destroyed
from top to bottom all Government both of Church
and State, And as their brains turn'd round upon
earth after every wind of Doctrine, so their souls turn
here in perpetuall torments of rotation.</p>
               <p>A little further I spied <hi>Prometheus</hi> removed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from <hi>Caucasus,</hi> with a ravenous Vulture tearing
and feeding upon his liver, which as one part was
eaten, renewed presently after, and abundance of new
commers were tormented in the same manner, these
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98502:32"/>
I was told they were <hi>Gherionians</hi> also that were punishd
like <hi>Prometheus,</hi> because as he was tortured so for stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
fire from Heven, by which was meant for prying
too far into the secrets of the gods, so those fiery Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
of <hi>Gheriona</hi> were tortured, for offring to dive too
far into the high points of <hi>Predestination, Election,</hi> and
<hi>Reprobation,</hi> being not contented <hi>sapere ad sobrietatem,</hi>
but were gaping ever and anon after new lights, and
flashes of illuminations to pry into the Book of Life.</p>
               <p>Then I came to the bottomles Tub which <hi>Danaus</hi>
daughters were a filling, a nomberles company of
other such tubs were there, and <hi>Gherionian</hi> women
and men were incessantly labouring to fill them up
with the stenchy black waters of <hi>Acheron;</hi> I was told
that they were those over-curious peeple in <hi>Gheriona</hi>
which wold be never satisfied with spirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
having no other devotion than to be alwaies
<hi>learning,</hi> and never comming to the truth, as these
poor restlesse fillers could never come to any bottom.</p>
               <p>Then I beheld the most horrid tortures of those
Giants who wold have pulld <hi>Iupiter</hi> out of his Throne,
and a world of <hi>Gherionians</hi> among them, who partaked
of the same tortures, because they had conspir'd on
earth to destroy their lawfull King.</p>
               <p>Not far further I might spy dazling my eyes fiery
glowing tubs made Pulpit-like, and I was told they
were prepared for those prophane presumptuous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks,
and other lay-men who use to preach, and
so abuse the sacred Oracles of God; And <hi>Uzza</hi> was not
far off, who lay in torments there for being too bold
with the Holy Ark.</p>
               <p>Not far distant I saw hoops of iron that were made
<hi>Garter-like</hi> of hot candent steel, I was told that they
were design'd for the perjur'd Knights of that <hi>Order</hi>
in <hi>Gheriona</hi> to wear upon their legs when they com
thither, for breaking in the late war the solemn Oath
they had taken at their Installment, to <hi>defend the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Quarrells, the Rights and Dignities of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verain,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nere unto them I might see brasse hoops glowing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98502:33"/>
with fire, and they were <hi>Scarfs-like,</hi> I was told they
were ordained for those Knights of the <hi>Bath</hi> to wear
for Ribbands next their skins when they came thither,
for infringing that sacred <hi>Sacramentall Oath</hi> they took
at their election, which was, <hi>To love their Soverain
above all earthly creture, and for his Right and Dignity to
live and die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little beyond I saw a <hi>Copper</hi>-table with chairs of
the same, all candent hot, I was told that those were
for perjur'd Privy-Councellors who had broke their
Oath to their King, which obliged them to <hi>be tru and
faithfull servants unto him, and if they knew or understood
any manner of thing to be attempted, done, or spoken against
his Majestie's Person, Honour, Crown, or Dignity, they
swore to lett and withstand the same to the uttermost of their
power, and cause it to be revealed either to Himself, or any
other of his Privy Councill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hard by I saw a little Furnace so glowing hot, that
it lookt of the colour of a <hi>Ruby</hi> or <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> I was told
that it was to clap in the Master of a King's Jewell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
when he comes thither, for being so perfidious
and perjurious to his Master.</p>
               <p>Not far off I might see a huge brasse Caudron full
of molten lead, with som Brewers cruelly torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therein, for setting their own Country on fire.</p>
               <p>I was curious to know, whether ther were any
other infernall tortures besides those of <hi>fire;</hi> Yes, I
was answered, for to speak of <hi>fire</hi> to a peeple habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to a cold Climat were not onely to make them
slight Hell, but to have a mind to go thither; So my
Spirit brought me a little Northward, and shewed
me a huge Lough, where ther were frosted Mountains
up and down, and I might discover amongst them a
world of <hi>Blew-caps</hi> lying in beds of yce, with their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and toes nipt, the isicles stuck to their fingers ends
like horns, and a bleak hispid wind blew incessantly
upon them, they made the most pitteous noise that
me-thought I had heard in all Hell, for they wawl'd,
screech'd, and howl'd out ever and anon this dismall
note, <hi>Wea is me, wea is me that ever I betraid my gid King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98502:33"/>
Among all those damned souls I desired to see what
punishment an <hi>Atheist</hi> had, my Spirit was ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
me, that ther were no <hi>Atheists</hi> in Hell at all; 'tis
tru they were so upon <hi>Earth</hi> before they came hither,
but here they sensibly find and acknowledge ther is
a God by his justice and judgments, for ther is here
<hi>poena sensûs</hi> and <hi>poena damni,</hi> ther is inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
torture, The outward torments you behold are
nothing so grievous as the inward regrets and agonies
the souls have, to have lost <hi>Heven</hi> wherof they were
once capable, and to be eternally forsaken by their
<hi>Creator</hi> the Lord of Light, their chiefest Good; Add
hereunto that they know these torments to be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
easelesse, and remedilesse; Besides these qualities
which are incident to the damned souls, they have
neither patience towards themselfs in their own suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frances,
nor any pitty towards others, but their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
is so accursed that they wish their neighbours
torments were still greter then their own; Moreover
their torments never lessen, or have any mitigation by
tract of time, or degrees of sense, but they persevere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
in the same heighth, they are still fresh, and the
soul made stronger to bear them; I saw that <hi>everlasting
Villain</hi> who committed one of the first sacriledges we
read of, by burning the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> whose tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were so fresh and cruciatory upon him, as they
were the first day he was hurl'd in thither; <hi>Iudas</hi> was
in the same degree and strength of torture as he was
the first moment he fell thither; <hi>Iack Cade, Wat Tyler,
Iack Straw,</hi> and <hi>Ket the Tanner</hi> did fry as fresh as they
did that very instant they were tumbled down thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Amongst whom it made my heart to melt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me when I saw som of their new-com'd Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
amongst them, wherof I knew divers; And
though <hi>society</hi> is wont to be some solace to men in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
yet they conceived no comfort at all by these
fresh companions.</p>
               <p>It is high time for us now, said my good guiding
Spirit, to be gone to the other world, so we directed
our cours towards the Ferry upon <hi>Styx;</hi> But Lord
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98502:34"/>
what a nomber of lurid and ugly squalid countenances
did I behold as I pass'd; There was one sort of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I had not seen before, ther were divers that hung
by their <hi>toungs</hi> upon posts up and down, I asked
what they were, answer was made, that they were
<hi>prick-ear'd Preachmen, Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> who against
their knowledg as well as against their consciences,
did seduce the ignorant peeple of <hi>Gheriona</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boncia,</hi>
and incite them to war; And ther was a new
tenter-hook provided for one <hi>gran Villain,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
Sentence of death against his own Soverain
Prince, whose <hi>Subject</hi> he was, and whom by a sacred
Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> he was tyed to obey.</p>
               <p>A little further I might see multitudes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee-men
and others, slopping up drops of <hi>molten
lead</hi> in lieu of <hi>French Barly-broth,</hi> with a rabble of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices</hi>
sweeping the gutters of Hell, with brooms
tufted with ugly Adders and Snakes, because they
running into the Wars and leaving their <hi>wares,</hi> had
therby broke their Indentures with their Masters,
and their Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to their lawfull Prince.</p>
               <p>Passing then along towards the Ferry, a world of
hideous shapes presented themselfs unto my sight;
There I saw corroding cares, pannick fears, pining
griefs, ugly rebellion, revengefull malice, snaky dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
oppression, tyranny, disobedience, perjury, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
and <hi>spirituall pride</hi> (the sin that first peepled
Hell) put to exquisit torments; Couches of Toads,
Scorpions, Asps, and Serpents were in a corner hard
by; I asked for whom they were prepared, I was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
for som <hi>Evangelizing Gherionian</hi> Ladies,
which did egg on their husbands to War; So having
as I thought by a miraculous providence charm'd
three-headed <hi>Cerberus,</hi> by pointing at him with the
signe of the <hi>Crosse</hi> upon my fingers, we passed quietly
by to the Ferry, where being com I found tru what
<hi>Pluto</hi> had said before, that ther were divers <hi>Gherionian</hi>
Tarpalins entertain'd by <hi>Charon,</hi> but they were in
most cruell tortures, for their bodies were covered all
over very thick and close with canvases pitch'd and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98502:34"/>
tarr'd, which continually burnt and flam'd round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them.</p>
               <p>Herewith I got awake again about the dawning of
the day, and it was high time to do so;

                        <l>I heard no bell for <hi>Mattens</hi> toll or ring.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Being thus awak'd, and staring on the Light</l>
                        <l>Which silverd all my face and glaring sight,</l>
                        <l>I clos'd my eyes again to recollect</l>
                        <l>What I had dreamt, &amp; make my thoughts reflect</l>
                        <l>Upon themselfs—</l>

               </p>
               <p>I say, that having after such a long noctivagation,
and variety of horrid visions, return'd to my perfect
expergefaction, I began by a serious recollection of
my self to recall to my thoughts by way of reminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
those dismall and dreadfull objects that had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peerd
unto me, for though I was in <hi>Hell,</hi> yet I did not
taste of <hi>Lethe</hi> all the while, insomuch that I did not
forget any thing which I had seen; All the said ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
presented themselfs unto me so reall, that if I
had bin transported with that opinion wherof many
great Clerks have bin, <hi>viz.</hi> That Devills are nothing
els but the ill affections, the exorbitant passions and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98502:35"/>
perturbances of the minde; I say, if I had bin plac'd
in such an opinion, this trance wold have convinc'd
me; You may easily imagin what apprehensions of
horror these Apparitions left in my brain behind them,
just as a River when by an inundation she hath swel'd
out of her wonted channell, doth use to leave along
the neighbouring medowes seggs and other weeds
with much riffraff stuff behind her upon her return to
her former bed; so did this Vision after that deluge of
objects wherwith my brain was overwhelm'd for the
time, leave behind them black sudds, and many a
ghastly thought within me, which after some rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
wrought in me a perfect change and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those mimicall giddy opinions wherwith I
was carried away before, but while I delayed the
time of declaring my self that way, I was suddenly
surprized, and justly transmuted to this shape and
species.</p>

               <p>You may perceive by the effects of this <hi>visional</hi>
Dream the excellency and high prerogatives of the
<hi>Human Soul,</hi> who by the ministry of the <hi>Imagination</hi>
can make such sallies abroad, that leaving the grosse
tabernacle of the body she can at plesure climb up
to the skies, and make a Scale of the stars to conduct
her to the Empyrean Heven; she can also descend in
a trice to the great <hi>Abysse,</hi> and take a survey of the
kingdom of darknes, And though it be a common
Maxim that, <hi>ab Orco nulla redemptio,</hi> ther is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
from Hell the passage thence being irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
yet the <hi>Rational soul</hi> while she informs the body
hath this priviledg, that she can make egresses and
regresses, she can enter and come off clear from <hi>Hell</hi>
it self, when she list, and all this in an instant; Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
she may be said to participat of that admired qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
which is inhaerent in that most comfortable of all
cretures the <hi>Light,</hi> which is held the Souverain of
all sensible qualities by the Philosophers, and to com
neerest to the nature of a Spirit, for <hi>Light</hi> requires but
an instantaneous moment or point of time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98502:35"/>
its office of illumination, and to dilate it self from
one Pole to the other throughout the whole Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere,
whence some infer that <hi>Light</hi> is incorporeal,
because 'tis an unquestion'd principle among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalists,
that all bodies require a succession of time
in their motion, which <hi>Light</hi> needs not; But ther is
this difference 'twixt the <hi>Imagination</hi> of a human soul
and <hi>Light,</hi> that ther besom places wherinto <hi>Light</hi>
cannot enter, but ther is no part of the Universe so
impervious where the <hi>Imagination</hi> may not make his
accesses and recesses at plesure, as appeers by yours
while you made that progresse during the time of that
extasy; And now me-thinks that these, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
of the <hi>Rational soul</hi> should incite you to shake
off that brutish nature, which hath no other idaea or
object of happines, but what sense exposeth for the
present time to corporeall things onely; I say the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of what I said before shold move you to

               <p>Man! Truly Sir, I am sorry the shape I now bear
resembleth Man so much, I could wish it were far
more unlike, for the horrid and unheard-of sacrileges
and perjuries of my own Nation makes me abhor the
very name of <hi>Man,</hi> much more his <hi>nature;</hi> For I dare
confidently assert, that ther were never since the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
had power to possesse poor Mortalls such <hi>Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clites</hi>
in Religion, such a <hi>Bedlam</hi> of Sectaries, who to
exalt the Kingdom of Christ wold heave it up on <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi>'s
back, for 'tis the Devill's Reformation to turn
order to confusion, and certainties to incertitudes as
they have done; But these Refiners of Government
will prove Quack-salvers at last, for in lieu of raising
up a Common-wealth, they have pull'd down the
two main Pillars which use to support all States, <hi>viz.
Religion</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> making both <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> and
tumbling all things into a horrid disorder and hurli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burly,
insomuch that it may be truly said, these new
sorts of <hi>Recusants</hi> did more hurt than ever the old
could have don, if the subterranean plot of <hi>Nitre</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:98502:36"/>
had taken effect; For <hi>that</hi> had onely destroyed som
few of the Royall Race, of the Prelates and Peers then
in being, but these hell-hounds have wholly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
and blown up all the three to perpetuity, and
all this onely by the stench of their pestiferous breath;
Nor have they offered violence to <hi>Religion</hi> onely, but
they have affronted <hi>Reson</hi> it self, nay they have baffled
<hi>Common sense;</hi> And for all this we may thank <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boncia,</hi>
and <hi>Polihaima</hi> that rotten-hearted City, who
like a fat cheese is so full of Maggots; And indeed
what could be expected else from these pseudopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
but disorder, confusion, and ataxy, considering
how their first reach of policy was to throw the ball
of discord 'twixt the Subject and his Souvrain, whom
yet they had vowed to make the best belovedst Prince
that ever was; Insomuch that <hi>darknesse</hi> it self is no
more opposit to <hi>light,</hi> as their actions were diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
to their words, oaths, and protestations.</p>

               <p>Truly they are stupendous things that you have
told me, but touching the difference you speak of that
they did put 'twixt Prince and Peeple, it was the most
compendious way to bring all things to confusion and
ruine, to which purpose I shall relate unto you an
<hi>Apolog;</hi> Ther hapned a shreud commotion and distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in the <hi>Body Naturall</hi> 'twixt the <hi>Head</hi> and the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
not onely the <hi>noble parts (many</hi> of them) but the
<hi>common</hi> inferiour organs banded against Him in a high
way of presumption; The <hi>heart</hi> which is the source of
life with the <hi>pericardium</hi> about it did <hi>swell</hi> against him,
the <hi>splene</hi> and <hi>gall</hi> flowed over, the <hi>liver</hi> gathered ill
blood, all the <hi>humors</hi> turned to <hi>choller</hi> against him; the
<hi>arms</hi> lifted up themselfs against him, neither <hi>back,
hamms,</hi> or <hi>knees</hi> wold bow to him, nay the very <hi>feet</hi>
offered to kick him; The <hi>ribbs</hi> and <hi>reins,</hi> the <hi>hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drium,</hi>
the <hi>diaphragma,</hi> the <hi>miseraik</hi> and <hi>emulgent</hi> veins
were fill'd with <hi>corrupt</hi> blood against him, nay the <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogastrium</hi>
and the <hi>bowells</hi> made an <hi>intestine</hi> warr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; While this feud lasted, it hapned that
these tumultuary <hi>members</hi> fell out among themselfs,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98502:36"/>
the <hi>hand</hi> wold have all the fingers equall, nay the <hi>toes</hi>
wold be all of an even length, and the rest of the
subservient <hi>members</hi> wold be <hi>Independent;</hi> They grew
so foolish that they wold have the <hi>fundament</hi> to be
where the <hi>mouth</hi> is, the <hi>brest</hi> where the <hi>back,</hi> the <hi>belly</hi>
where the <hi>brain,</hi> and the <hi>yard</hi> where the <hi>nose</hi> is; The
<hi>sholders</hi> shold be said to be no more backwards, nor the
<hi>leggs</hi> downwards; a bloody quarrell fell out 'twixt the
<hi>heart</hi> and the <hi>liver</hi> which of them received the first
formation, and whether of the two be the chiefest
shop of languification, which question bred so much
gall 'twixt the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> and the <hi>Galenists;</hi> While
this <hi>spleene</hi> and strange <hi>tympany</hi> of pride lasted, it causd
such an ebullition and heat in the masse of <hi>blood,</hi>
such a stiffnes in the <hi>cartilages</hi> and <hi>gristles,</hi> such a lank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in the <hi>arteries,</hi> that it put the whole <hi>compositum</hi> in
a high burning Feaver or kind of ravening Frenzy,
which in time grew Hepticall, and so threatned a
dissolution of the whole frame of the body.</p>
               <p>'Tis to be feard that the same fate attends the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall</hi>
body of your Nation as did the <hi>Naturall</hi> I spoke
of; But matters may mend, and as you began to find
a Reformation in your self before you were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted
to this shape, so the whole Nation may come to
their old temper again; Therfore you shal do well, now
that you are invited by so pregnant an opportunity,
and so reall a proffer, to shake off that Apish or Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky-fac'd

safely transported to the bosom of your own dear

such a <hi>Vertigo,</hi> that all the Druggs of <hi>Egypt</hi> cannot

practise your eloquence upon som other, but as for
me you spend your breath in vain, and all this while
you have said as good as nothing, for I so far detest
<hi>human kind,</hi> that, in the mind I am in, I had rather

which is so horrid a thing to all created na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

               <p>Truly if I had don so, you might have justly thought
your self to have been deluded by me, and that I had
don you but half a courtesie or a fained promise; Now
touching promises a noble mind shold not make any,
that he hath not the <hi>wil</hi> to do, or the <hi>power</hi> to perform,
for the one proceeds from pure <hi>dissimulation,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from meer <hi>foolishnes:</hi> But know, that all that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall
of time you have held a parly with those transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Animals you have tried already, they had the same
reach and full light of <hi>Reson</hi> as they had when they
were Men.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Morphandra.</speaker>
               <p>It may well be that they find and feel more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
and sweetnes in that life they now lead,
wherof men have no sense or knowledg, therfore 'tis
no thing of wonder that they desire to continue so;
But go and poursue the point of your enterprise, for it
may be you may find som other that will be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to your counsell herein, and 'tis very probable
that Hinde may do it.</p>

               <p>'Tis observed by wise men, that they who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98502:38"/>
a way of themselfs to live contentedly and
well, are to be plac'd in the first degree of vertu; And
they which cannot do it of themselfs, but are content
to be directed by the counsell of wiser men, are to
be plac'd in the second degree; But they who are not
capable to counsell themselfs, nor receive counsell
from others, are not worthy to be rank'd in the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Rational</hi> cretures; Of this last kind those silly
Animals are with whom I have held discours, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis no marvail that my perswasions could not
take place with them; But knowing it to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of humanity for one to commiserat and help
another, I will push on my endeavours in this point,
and see what I can do with that lovely <hi>white Hinde,</hi>
for that sex whereof she was formerly useth to be
more tender, and to take impressions more easily:
Gentle creture, I come to be the messenger of good
tydings unto you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>O! may Heven be blessed, I understand the accents
of Man, and have the strings of my toung loosned to

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>I hope now to have met with one fit for my purpose,
for I hear her thank Heven that she is come again to
the gift of speech: Give me leave to ask you, gentle
<hi>Hinde,</hi> how came you to be thus so strangely trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>It was the great Queen <hi>Morphandra</hi> who hath put
this shape upon me; But, Sir, give me leave to return
you a question, Wherfore are you so desirous to
know the cause of my transmutation? for I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ask'd the reson ever since by any, nor had I my
speech return'd unto me till now, ever since I went
upon four leggs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>The reson that I desire to know the cause of your
transfiguration is for your infinit advantage, as you
shall find, therfore I pray dispence with my curiosity,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98502:39"/>
if I desire to know further what country and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you were of when you were a <hi>Rational</hi> creture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I was born in <hi>Marcopolis</hi> that rare <hi>Maiden</hi> City,
so much renowned throughout the world for the
strangenes of her scituation, for her policy, riches, and
power; But though she continu still a <hi>Virgin,</hi> yet she
is married once every year to <hi>Neptune</hi> whose minion
she is, which makes her accounted so salacious; There
I had my first birth, and was accounted one of the
Beauties of my time, till for som dissolut courses and
wildnes of youth, it pleased <hi>Morphandra</hi> to give me a
second kind of generation, and transmute me to this
shape you behold.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>You may then thank those Stars that guided me
hither, for I have obtained leave of <hi>Morphandra</hi> to
talk with you, nor onely so, but she hath bin pleased
to promise me that she will re-invest you in you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
fair nature if you desire it, therfore I quickly
expect your resolution, for the sudden counsells and
answers of women are observ'd to be the best, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that the more you think on a thing, the more
your thoughts use to be intangled; Therfore tell me
whether you will be a woman again, I or no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>No; ther's a short and sudden Laconicall answer
for you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis short I confesse, but I conceive it to be as rash
and inconsiderat, I hope you will think better on it,
for what an infinit advantage it is to be transversed
from a beast to be a noble <hi>Rational</hi> creture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>To be a <hi>Rational</hi> creture is not the thing that I am
so averse unto as much as to be a <hi>Woman,</hi> which sex
is so much undervalued and vilified by you, that
som of your Philosophers (or Foolosophers more
properly) have had the faces to affirm that we were
not of the same species with men, and if we were,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98502:39"/>
yet it was by an inferiour kind of creation, being made
only for multiplication and plesure; Others have given
out, that in point of generation <hi>woman</hi> by Natures design
is still meant for <hi>man,</hi> and that a female is a thing
brought into the world beyond Nature's intention,
either by the imperfection of seed, or some other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
Which absurd opinion how contrary it is to the
just order of nature, is manifest to any one that hath
but a crum of wit, considering how we also concur to
your generation, though som of your old doting Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sards
have held the contrary, holding us to be meerly
passive in that point.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis tru, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> who was one of the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that attended Nature's Cabinet-councell doth
affirm, that in the female ther is no active principle
of generation, but that she is meerly passive, affording
onely blood and the place of conception, the plastic
formative vertu residing in the <hi>Male</hi>'s feed; But this
opinion is exploded by our modern Physitians and
Naturalists, who assert that in the female also ther is
an active and plastic principle of generation, with a
procreative faculty, as appeers in the engendring of
a <hi>Mule</hi> which is a mix'd species proceeding from the
<hi>Horse</hi> and the <hi>Asse,</hi> whose whole form is made up
by the concurrence of both parents, so that the <hi>Horse</hi>
alone is not sufficient to produce such a creture, but the
<hi>Asse</hi> must co-operat as the efficient cause.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>You may well add hereunto that the child often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
resembleth the mother, therfore she must also
be an active principle in the formation; If it be so,
what a wrong is it to the justice and rules of nature
that <hi>Women</hi> shold be held but little better than <hi>Slaves?</hi>
how comes it that they shold be so vilipended and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil'd?
As that foolish <hi>Naturalist</hi> or <hi>Ninny,</hi> who wish'd
ther were another way to propagat Mankind than by
copulation with Women; Another blurted out, that
if men could live without the society of women, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
wold come down and dwell among them; But
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98502:40"/>
that <hi>stinking Cynick</hi> was the worst of all, who passing
by a tree where a woman having been abus'd and
beaten by her husband, had done her self violently
away, he wished <hi>that every tree might bear such blessed
fruit.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>Such speeches as these proceeded from a kind of
raillery or way of jesting, not from the judgment or
wishes of the parties that spoke them, and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
seen that they who play upon them with their
<hi>wits,</hi> have them most in their <hi>wishes;</hi> For ther is no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-minded
man but doth acknowledg them to be
born for our comfort and dearest companions, and to
be of equall degree with us in point of creation and
excellence, as also capable of the same Beatitude.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>Ther is good reson to think so, for the Creator took
the first woman out of the <hi>midst</hi> of man therby to be
his <hi>equall,</hi> and without any ostentation be it spoken
she was made of a more refined matter, <hi>viz.</hi> of the
<hi>Rib,</hi> which is a purer substance than the <hi>red</hi> slimy
earth wherof <hi>Adam</hi> was fram'd; And daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
tells us, that <hi>We</hi> are composed of purer plasticall
ingredients than <hi>You,</hi> because that if a <hi>man,</hi> be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of so fine a <hi>paste,</hi> wash his hands with the clearest
water in severall clean basons never so often, yet he
will leave som foulnes and faeculence behind; but a
<hi>Woman</hi> can do so and leave the water at last so clear,
so fair and limpid, as when it came from the fountain
or source it self in few times washing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis tru, she was made of a <hi>Rib,</hi> but 'twas a <hi>crooked</hi>
one, which makes many of your sex to be so crosse-graind;
This causeth many of them to be kept under
a greater servitude than otherwise they wold be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>A <hi>servitude</hi> indeed, or rather a tyranny, and we
must purchase this servitude with the weight of gold,
you having made that fine Law, that when any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is to be your companion, she must bring mony
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98502:40"/>
with her, which you call Dower or Matrimoniall
portion forsooth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>This Law is enacted for your good, for knowing
that you, in regard of your in-experience and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
cannot tell how to conserve your estates, the said
Dower is consign'd to your husbands to improve it
for your further profit, and to maintain you; Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that your husbands cannot be called <hi>Patrons</hi>
of your goods, but your <hi>Procurators</hi> in conserving
them, and if you chance to survive them they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to you, and most commonly with som advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
In the interim we trudge and toyl without, and
you within doors, onely to conserve it, which is but an
easie task.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>You say very well in that, for unlesse ther be a good
houswife at home to keep, in vain doth the husband
labour abroad to gather; But wheras you say that we
have not that prudence to manage an estate, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
it, I pray call to mind the Kingdom of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,</hi>
how long and how wisely was it governed by
women? Look upon that of <hi>Babylonia</hi> which was so
much amplified by <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and that of <hi>Scythia</hi> by
<hi>Tomiris,</hi> especially upon a late notable Queen in <hi>Ghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riona,</hi>
who rul'd triumphantly near upon 45 years;
And whereas you speak of the want of wisdom that
we have, I pray what were the nine <hi>Muses</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventrices
of all Sciences? what were the three <hi>Graces?</hi>
what were the twelve <hi>Sybills?</hi> what are the three <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi>
Vertues? nay what was <hi>Minerva</hi> the goddesse
of Wisdom, born out of the brain of <hi>Iove</hi> himself?
were they not all women?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis tru that <hi>Minerva</hi> issued out of <hi>Iupiter's</hi> brain,
but she had no <hi>woman</hi> to her mother, for so she had
not prov'd so wise; And touching the <hi>Muses, Graces,</hi>
and <hi>Sybills</hi> you speak of, you know as well that the
three <hi>fatall</hi> Sisters, and <hi>Erynnis</hi> the mother of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
were all women as well, together with the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98502:41"/>
three <hi>Furies</hi> of Hell; But if you look upon <hi>Heven,</hi> you
are but few there, for among the <hi>Planets</hi> ther are but
<hi>two</hi> of your sex, (<hi>viz. Venus</hi> and <hi>Cynthia</hi>) all the rest
are male.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>You may as well argue, that because among the
twelve Celestiall <hi>Signes</hi> ther are but three <hi>human</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and seven <hi>brute</hi> Animals, (with two <hi>inanimat</hi>)
that ther are more <hi>brute</hi> Animals in Heven than <hi>Men;</hi>
But, Sir, under favour, wheras you alledg that among
the Hevenly Planets ther are but two <hi>females,</hi> the rest
<hi>males,</hi> it shews that men are of a more erratic and
wandring humour than women; Now Sir, touching
that <hi>wisdom</hi> you speak of, you have more opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to get it by conversing with the world abroad,
and so pourchasing <hi>Experience</hi> which is the <hi>mirroir of
wisdom;</hi> Wheras we are kept within doores, and
shut up 'twixt a few walls, whence you have a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>That that woman deserves onely respect and honour,
whose actions and praises go not out of the walls of her own
house:</hi> And hereunto that you put us to all the drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and servile offices at home, while you are joviall
and feast it abroad; nor do you onely coop us up so in
a kind of prison, but you clap oftentimes a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
kind of lock upon us, wheras <hi>you,</hi> though you
have <hi>Inclosures</hi> of your own, yet you may go abroad
when you list, and, when your lust drives you, feed
upon the <hi>Common</hi> without controul; And is not this
pure slavery in us, and tyranny in you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>Concerning the first, <hi>Apelles</hi> us'd to paint a good
Houswife upon a Snayl, which intimated, that she
shold be as slow from gadding abroad, and when she
went she shold carry her house upon her back, that
is, she shold make all sure at home; Now to a good
houswife, her House shold be as the Sphere to a
Star, (I do not mean a <hi>wandring</hi> Starr) wherin she
shold twincle with neatnes as a Star in its Orb; And
how can you call that a prison wherof you keep the
keys, and are commandresses in chief? The <hi>Imperium
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98502:41"/>
domesticum</hi> you rule within doors, whither we bring
all that we gain abroad, and it is your office to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
and augment it, though many of you are so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
that you make the poor husband oftentimes to
<hi>turn a noble to nine-pence,</hi> as is intimated by that famous
picture of <hi>Polygnottus</hi> made of one <hi>Ocnus,</hi> who being
a <hi>Cordwayner</hi> by his Trade, as he was making new
Ropes, there was a <hi>Wisell</hi> hard by that gnawed off the
Cordage, by which was meant his <hi>Wife;</hi> For it is in the
wife to husband what the man gets, according to the
Poverb, <hi>Ask my wife whether I thrive or no,</hi> for if she be
prodigall she will bring her poor husband quickly to
<hi>thwitten a mill-post into a pudding-prick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the second point, of laying artificiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
upon your bodies, it is because som of you can
be no further trusted than you are seen; But this ill-favoured
custom I confesse is us'd onely in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where women are more hot and lustfull than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
other climes, for the Naturalists observe without
any partiality, that <hi>your</hi> sex is more salacious than
the <hi>Masculine,</hi> wherof ther might be produced a
clowd of examples, I will instance onely in two, and
they of the highest rank, <hi>viz.</hi> in two <hi>Empresses,</hi> the
one a <hi>Roman,</hi> the other a <hi>German;</hi> the first was so
cunning in her lust, that she wold take in no passenger
into her Barge (for women are <hi>leaking</hi> vesells) untill
the Barge was freighted, for fear the resemblance of
the child shold discover the tru father, and then she
wold take in all commers; The second having buried
a most gallant man she had to her husband, her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
advised her with ghostly counsell, that for the
future she shold live like a <hi>Turtle</hi> during the remnant
of her life, because it was impossible to find such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Mate again among the whole masse of Mankind;
Wherto she answered, <hi>Father, since you will have me to
lead the life of a Bird, why not of a Sparrow as well as of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Bird?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>I shall confront your instances by two other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
as memorable altogether, the first of <hi>Zenebia,</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:98502:42"/>
who wold have no carnall copulation with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
after she found her self once quick, but wold
continue in an admired course of continence all the
time of her pregnancy; Moreover the Saint-like Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
<hi>Bettrice,</hi> who in the verdant spring of her age
after <hi>Henry</hi> her husbands death, lived ever after like
a <hi>Turtle</hi> as you speak of, by immuring her self in a
Monastic Cell, and burying her body alive as it were
when he was gone; But what an extraordinary rare
example was that of Queen <hi>Artemisia,</hi> who living
chast ever after her husband <hi>Mausolus</hi> his death, got
his ashes all put in urnes, wherof she wold take down
a dramm every morning fasting, and next her heart,
saying, That her body was the fittest place to be a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher
to her most dear husband, notwithstanding
that she had erected another <hi>outward</hi> Tomb for him,
that continues to this day one of the Wonders of the
world: Furthermore you know, I believe, better then
I, Sir, that at this day in many parts of the Orientall
world, such is the rare love of wifes to their dead
husbands, that they throw themselfs alive into the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Pile to accompany his body to the other life,
though in the flower of their years.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>It is confessed that many of you have noble spirits,
that marvellous rare affections lodge in you, and so
you may be deservedly call'd the second part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
in regard you are so necessary for the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof, and to peeple the world.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>Yet you call us the <hi>weaker vessells,</hi> but as weak as
we are, we are they in whom the whole masse of
both sexes is moulded; neverthelesse some use us as
Spice-bags, which when the spices are taken out are
thrown away into som mouldy corner; And though
we have the mould within us wherin you are all cast,
though we co-operat, and contribut our purest blood
towards your generation, though we bring you forth
into the world with such dolorous pangs and throwes,
though you are nourished afterwards and nurs'd
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98502:42"/>
with our very bloods, yet our os-spring must bear
onely your <hi>sirnames,</hi> as if we had no share at all in him,
his memory living onely in you, though <hi>Tumontia</hi> in
this point be more noble than other Countries, by
giving the sirname of the <hi>Maternall</hi> line oftentimes to
som of the male children.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all these indispensible necessities
the world hath of women, yet ther is no other species
of cretures wherin the female is held to be so much
inferiour to the male as we are amongst you, who use
to sleight, misprize, and tyrannize over us so much;

               <p>The reson of this is, because ther are so many of
you either shrews, or light and loose in the hilts, and
'tis a sad case when <hi>Viri fama jacet inter uxoris fempora;</hi>
Touching the first, ther's an old proverb, that <hi>Every
one knowes how to tame a shrew but he who hath her,</hi> and
though ther might be multitude of examples produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
yet I will instance but in a few, the first two shall
be <hi>Zappora</hi> and <hi>Xantippe,</hi> the one married to <hi>Moyses</hi> a
holy man, the other to <hi>Socrates</hi> a great Philosopher,
how cross-grain'd the one was, the Sacred Oracles wil
tell, and for the other, her husband comming one day
in when she was in an ill humour, she scolded him
out of doors, and at his going out she whipp'd up into
an upper room, and poured down a potfull of piss
upon his sconce, which made the poor patient hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
shake his head, and break forth into this speech,
<hi>I thought that after so much thunder we should have rain.</hi>
Another damnable scold having revil'd and curs'd
her husband a great while, all which time she had the
Devill often in her mouth, to whom she bann'd him,
at last he said, Hold thy toung wife, and threaten me
no more with the Devil, for I know he will do me no
hurt, <hi>because I have married his Kinswoman;</hi> This made
the Epigrammatist to sing prettily,

               <p>I, we use to be the common subject of your drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,
and you would want matter for your wits to
work upon were it not for us; But, touching those
humours you pointed at before which are incident to
us somtimes, they proceed from the ill usage, and
weaknes of the husbands, who know not how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
a wife, which is one of the prime points of Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
prudence; We say proverbially, that a <hi>good
Iack makes a good Gill,</hi> a discreet husband makes a good
wife, though being the weaker vessell, and having no
other weapon than her toung she break out somtimes
into humors; What a sad thing is it for a woman to
have a thing called a husband weaker than her self?
how fullsom wold such a fool be? such silly coxcombs
as are jealous upon every sleight occasion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
them so barbarously as was spoken before,
deserve to wear such branch'd horns, such spilters
and trochings on their heads, as that goodly Stagg
bears which you see browsing among those trees, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with those pretty <hi>Fawns, Prickets, Sorrells,
Hemuses,</hi> and <hi>Girls,</hi> wherof som are mine which
I brought into the world without any pain or
help of Midwife, and quickly lost all care of them
afterwards.</p>

               <p>Well, let's give over these impertinent altercati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> and go to the main busines; I told you
that Queen <hi>Morphandra</hi> is willing, at my intercession,
to restore you unto your former nature, and I have a
lusty Galeon in port to convey you to <hi>Marcopolis,</hi> that
renowned and rare City.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis tru <hi>Marcopolis</hi> is a most famous City, having
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98502:43"/>
continued a pure <hi>Virgin</hi> from her infancy these
twelve centuries of years and upwards, and 'tis said
she shall continue so still, according to the Prophecy,
<hi>Untill her husband forsake her, viz.</hi> the Sea, with whom
her marriage is renewed every year; But 'twas ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
when I liv'd there, that her <hi>Husband</hi> began to
forsake her, that the <hi>Adrian</hi> Sea did retire and grow
shallower about her, which som interpret to be an ill
<hi>Omen,</hi> and portends the losse of her <hi>Maidenhead:</hi> But,
Sir, touching my former nature, truly I wold desire
nothing of it again but the faculty of <hi>speech</hi> that I
might <hi>talk</hi> somtimes; In all other things I prefer by
many degrees this species wherin I am now invested
by Queen <hi>Morphandra,</hi> which is far more <hi>chaste</hi> and
<hi>temperat,</hi> far more <hi>healthfull</hi> and <hi>longer-liv'd:</hi> Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>first,</hi> Ther's no creture whose season of carnall
copulation is shorter, for the <hi>Rutting-time</hi> lasts but
from the midst of <hi>September</hi> to the end of <hi>October,</hi> nor
is there any other creture whose enjoyment of plesure
is shorter in the act; moreover when we are <hi>full,</hi> we
never after keep company with the male for eight
months; Concerning the <hi>second, viz.</hi> our <hi>temperatnes,</hi>
we never use to overcharge or cloy nature with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
besides our food is simple, those green leafs and
grasse you see are our nutriment, which our common
mother the Earth affords us so gently, we require no
variety of Viands, which makes that our breath is
sweeter than the fairest Ladies in <hi>Marcopolis,</hi> and our
<hi>fewmishes</hi> with what else comes from within us is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so unsavoury; Nor need we that monthly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
which is so improperly called <hi>Flowers,</hi> it being
such rank poyson that it will crack a tru crystall glass;
Nay 'tis observed, that if a menstruous woman come
near an alveary or hive of Bees, they forsake their
food all the while, finding the aire to be infected;
Nor have we any <hi>gall</hi> within us, and herein we are
like the <hi>Dove</hi> among Birds, and the <hi>Dolphin</hi> among
fish; onely there's a kind of acid humor that nature
hath put in our Singles, the smell wherof causeth our
enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Doggs,</hi> to fly from us; Moreover,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98502:44"/>
we are not subject to abortions, and that curse
which the Creator inflicted upon <hi>Woman-kind,</hi> that
they shold bring forth their children with sorrow and
pain, which we are free from; And such is our love
to Mankind, that when we have brought forth our
young ones, we trust them rather with <hi>them</hi> than with
other beasts, by putting them near high-waies, or
dwelling-houses for protection; Touching the
<hi>third,</hi> which is <hi>healthfulnesse,</hi> it is far beyond that of
<hi>women,</hi> as appears by our longaevity and extension of
life, which is next to that of an <hi>Elephant,</hi> (whose <hi>youth</hi>
begins not till he be threescore year old) according
to the <hi>Tumontian</hi> Proverb, <hi>A Hedg lasteth three years,
a Dogg three hedges, a Horse three doggs, a Man three
horses, a Hart three men, an Elephant three harts;</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are full of admirable examples how long som of
of us have liv'd, let one serve for all, When <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silaus</hi>
dwelt in <hi>Licosura,</hi> as the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Annalls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
he took a <hi>Hinde</hi> who wore a collar, wheron was
engraven, <hi>I was a Fawn when Agapenor was taken in
Troy,</hi> which by the computation that then was made,
was above three hundred years; Nor had <hi>Aesculapius,</hi>
that <hi>Archiatros</hi> or god of Physic, arrived to so fair an
age, and to such a miraculous perfection in that <hi>Art,</hi>
had he not been nurs'd with <hi>Hinde</hi>'s milk; For length
of time brings experience, and wisdom with it along,
and somtimes the gift of <hi>Prophesie,</hi> as was that antient
<hi>Hinde</hi> of that great Captain <hi>Sertorius,</hi> whom 'twas
thought <hi>Diana</hi> had inspir'd with a <hi>fatidicall</hi> spirit;
Insomuch that <hi>Sertorius</hi> never gave Battle, or attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any great designe without advising first with that
<hi>Hart:</hi> Add hereunto, that when after so fair an age
we come to die, ther's nothing within and without our
dead bodies but is usefull for Mankind, how much
are our very <hi>skins</hi> valued? how medicinall is that kind
of <hi>bone</hi> which is found in the left ventricle of a <hi>Hart</hi>'s

what exquisit vertues hath the Hart's <hi>horn,</hi> with
other parts of the body, as the <hi>Naturalists</hi> observe?
Wheras ther is nothing in the most noisom carcases

who seeing a Horse with rich trappings, and carrying

taking notice of it, put the velvet-saddle upon the

have you prevail'd? have you made her inclinable to

to that shape, not that he wanted understanding (as
the Horse and <hi>Mule</hi> are said to do) for that Nation
hath generally a competent proportion of <hi>that,</hi> but
partly because Physitians there use to ride upon
<hi>Mules</hi> to visit their Patients, as also because that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in generall use to be tax'd for their slow pace and

               <p>'Tis tru that the <hi>Tumantian</hi> is tardy and slow in
his counsells when he is moulding of a design, and
therin he may be said to have a <hi>Saturnian</hi> motion, but
when his design is ripe, and ready to be put in action,
then he is nimble enough and follows the motion of
<hi>Mercury;</hi> Add hereunto, that he is not onely slow,
but wonderfull secret in his counsells, insomuch that
his designs may be called <hi>Mysteries</hi> while they are <hi>sur

               <p>Poor stupid Animal, how camest thou to be thus
so pitifully disguis'd and transform'd from thy first
species, and so honourable a profession? for among all
other vocations of life, they say the Physitian is to be
<hi>honoured;</hi> Art thou desirous to be re-invested and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in thy first Nature and Calling, in case Queen

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mule.</speaker>
               <p>Truly no, for I have an utter disaffection both to
my first Species, to my Country, and Calling, in regard
I find far more contentment in this constitution of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and course of life; Touching the first, I am, as I
am now, free from those vexations of spirit, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances
of mind wherunto Mankind is so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
obnoxious, or rather inslav'd; I feed here upon
pure simples, such as the gentle earth produceth and
puts out of her prolificall womb, my stomack is never
overcharg'd with surfeits, nor my brain intoxicated
with strong drink and the juyce of the grape, in every
berry whereof ther lurks a kind of Devill, for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <p>'Tis tru, that human brain is like a garden, wherin
sundry sorts of herbs and flowers do grow, but touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Country-men, they are least subject of any
peeple to such distractions and diversity of opinions,
in regard of their exact obedience to their <hi>Spirituall</hi>
and <hi>Civill Governours:</hi> But what is the cause that you
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98502:46"/>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mule.</speaker>
               <p>First, because of the immoderat heat therof, the
Sun being too lavish of his beams, which causeth such
a sterility and barrennes, that in som places men live
like beasts, feeding most of all upon grasse and sallets,
onely they have haply a bottle of Oyl, and another of
Vinegar in their houses to pour amongst them, they
seldom see a loaf of bread or bit of meat, but when
noon or night comes, they go abroad and gather the
said grasse for their dinners and suppers, and if they
chance to have a few toasted Chesnuts 'tis a great
banquet; Which barrennes proceedeth not so much
from the heat of the Clime, as from the paucity and
lazines of the Inhabitants, who are so naturally given
to ease and sloth, from cultivating the earth, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
other parts of industry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>It must be granted that <hi>Tumontia,</hi> in point of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity,
is inferiour to som Regions, as also for nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, for if she had enough of both, she wold
make a <hi>Hen</hi> of the <hi>Cock,</hi> that is, she wold be too hard
for her next neighbour <hi>Artonia;</hi> But touching the first,
it carrieth som convenience with it, for it keeps the
peeple more temperat, and able to endure hardship;
Then the Country is not so subject to be over-run by
forren force, for in point of Invasion, an Army wold
be hunger-starv'd there before they could march
far: Yet I have observed, that as much as ther is of
any commodity in <hi>Tumontia,</hi> it is better then what
grows in other Countries, their Wines, their Flesh,
their Fruits, their Horses, their Silks, their Wool, &amp;c.
is better there than in other places, and let <hi>Artonia</hi>
her neighbour never vaunt so much of her plenty, yet
the <hi>Tumontian</hi> carrieth a better cloak on his back, he
wears better shoos on his feet, he hath a better sword
by his side, he drinks better wine, eats better fruit,
and hath a better horse under him, &amp;c. than the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonian;</hi>
And if Riches consists in Tresures, in plenty
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98502:47"/>
of Gold and Silver, <hi>Tumontia</hi> goes far beyond all other
Countries in that particular.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mule.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis tru, that the <hi>Tumontian</hi> King is Master of the
Mines both of Gold and Silver, yet if you go to the
common peeple, one may say, <hi>Who goes worse shodd than
the Shoo-maker's wife?</hi> for by mal administration, ther
is little of that gold and silver that's current among
the Inhabitants, either among Merchant, Yeoman, or
Artist, but all is a base Copper-coin, which the King
enhanceth or decries at plesure: That tresure you speak
of is sent abroad to feed and foment wars in other
countries, from which the <hi>Timontian</hi> King is never
free, his sword being alwaies out of the scabbard to
secure or enlarge his Territories, which makes the
<hi>Artonian</hi> say, that the <hi>Tumontian Ambition hath no Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,</hi>
it is interminable and boundlesse.</p>
               <p>Add hereunto that the Tresure you mention is an
exoticall commodity, 'tis had from far, from another
part of the world, where the <hi>Tumonitan</hi> is said to be a
Buggerer of his common Mother (the <hi>Earth</hi>) more
than any, for he fetches it out from her bowells som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
50 fathom deep, where the poor slave
that digs it sees neither Sun, Moon, nor Stars
once in a twelmonth, being chain'd to a kind of infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
darknesse under ground, and is as it were buried
alive before Nature hath out-run her due cours in
him; And it is a sad story to relate, how many millions
of human cretures were made away in the discovery
and conquest of that huge Continent, what a world of
blood was spilt, and innocent souls swept away; Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that if the Tresure which was got ever since,
and the Blood which was shed were put in counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scales,
the latter (as one said) wold outpoise the first.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis tru, that the reduction of that vast piece of
Earth was somwhat Tragicall, but it was impossible
to perform the work otherwise, and secure the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
in regard of that huge masse of Peeple and
swarms of Men which were found there, who could
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98502:47"/>
not by fair means be brought to civility: Now it is a
dubious question to determin, whether those <hi>Savages</hi>
gain'd more by the <hi>Tumontian,</hi> or the <hi>Tumontian</hi> by
<hi>them;</hi> 'Tis tru, that he got by them Gold, Silver, and
Gemms, which 'tis confessed are the most pretious
productions of Nature; But what did they receive
from the <hi>Tumontian</hi> by way of exchange? They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cived
Religion and vertu, civility and knowledg,
government and policy; Therfore the rest of the
known World should vail to the <hi>Tumontian</hi> for this
mighty Exploit, and happy Discovery, which it
seems the Great God of Nature had reserved for him
as a benediction from the beginning; And certainly a
mighty blessing it was, if we enter into a due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the Thing, and acknowledg it so, for
therby ther was as much of the Terrestriall Globe
found out, in point of extent and amplitude, as the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians
give out, that did very near equall all the
Old World: But what a world of dangers and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
did the <hi>Tumontian</hi> overcome in this achiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
At first the incertitude of the businesse, the
huge distance, the perills of the tnmbling Ocean did
offer themselfs; On the other side, the Expences of the
Expedition, and the despair of more provisions when
the old stores were spent, as also being to take footing
on a new Earth, the Inhabitants might prove stronger
than the Invaders &amp;c. It cannot be denied, but such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances
as these might have distracted &amp; deterrd
the highest human nature from such an incertain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
But at last the <hi>Tumontian</hi> courage and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
was such, that it broke through all these difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
And as the generous Boar, being entangled in the
Toyls, doth try all possible ways, hee turns about and
strugles how to get out, at last, when all will not serve
the turn, he lies down 'twixt quietnes and despair,
putting himself upon the mercy of the Huntsman;
So the <hi>Fortune</hi> of that great Action being tied as it were
to those apprehensions of fear and doubt which did
possesse it, at last she doth prostrate her self at the feet
of the <hi>Tumontian</hi> valour and vertue, tying her self ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98502:48"/>
by a perpetuall tribut; She brings him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Mines and Mountains of Gold, yea Rivers run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with red Oar, Seas full of Pearl, Soiles full of
Aromatical Spices, new Species of useful cretures &amp;c.
All this did that new World afford <hi>Tumontia</hi> as a
gratefull return for such indefatigable labours, and
constancy in poursuance of that glorious Enterprize.</p>

               <p>Noble Prince, truly <hi>Tumontia</hi> is infinitely engaged
unto you for these high Elogiums you please to give
of her, yet, under favor, ther is a strange <hi>fate,</hi> I am
loath to say a <hi>curse,</hi> which attends that far fetch'd
Tresure you magnifie so much; For observable it is,
that not long after the conquest of those harmlesse
peeple, whom God and Nature had planted there
from the first Creation, the revolt of <hi>Hydraulia</hi> and the
confederat Provinces hapned, which consum'd of
that Tresure you speak of above five and twenty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
millions first and last, otherwise the <hi>Tumontian</hi>
Kings might have pav'd their Courts, and til'd their
Palaces (as it was said else-where) with Gold and
Silver; For as I told you before, the least part of this
Tresure remains in <hi>Tumontia,</hi> and that is onely in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries
and other Religious Houses, the common
coyne is Brasse and Copper, wherin the <hi>Hydraulian</hi>
'tis thought hath don more mischief to <hi>Tumontia</hi> than
any other way, for copper and brasse being cheap
with her, she is so dextrous in counterfeiting the
<hi>Tarmontian</hi> coyne, that whole Sows of Lead, and Masts
hollowed within have been found cramm'd with
that coyne among her Cargazons, when she came to
the Ports of <hi>Tumontia</hi> to trade.</p>

               <p>Well, let's cut off these circumlocutions, and com
again to the main point; Have you a disposition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to your primitive Nature, to your Country,
and so learned a <hi>Calling?</hi> It is impossible for you to
meet with a fairer opportunity, and let me tell you,
<hi>Opportunity is the best moment in the whole extension of time.</hi>

               <speaker>Mule.</speaker>
               <p>Concerning my former Nature, I gave you som
touches formerly why I prefer my present condition
before it, I had also som reflexes upon my Country, I
could say much more of her, but that I am disswaded
by the proverb, that <hi>'tis a sorry bird that beraies his own
nest:</hi> Now Sir, touching my former profession, which
you applaud so much, 'tis tru, ther is a kind of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and lucre that does attend it, but withall ther is a
great deal of sordidnes; I will converse no more with
ulcers, cankers, and impostumes; I will pry no more
into close-stools and urinalls, or rake gold out of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements,
as the Poet tells us,
<q>
                     <l>Aurum Virgilius exstercore colligit Ennî,</l>
                     <l>Fecit Virgilius quod facit &amp; <hi>Medicus.</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>No are the Fees which belong to that Profession
in <hi>Tumontia</hi> any thing considerable, where Doctors
of Physic use to attend a Patient, with their Mules
and Foot-cloaths in a kind of state, yet they receive
but two shillings for their Fee for all their gravity
and pains; Add hereunto, that ther are up and down
the world so many poor Empiricks of this Trade, that
it is nothing of that esteem as it was; which makes
the <hi>Brittish Epigrammatist</hi> sing wittily,
<q>
                     <l>Qui modò venisti nostram <hi>Mendicus</hi> in Urbem,</l>

               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>Touching the first part of your speech, it shews the
exact government of <hi>Tumontia,</hi> where ther is an exact
Tax laid upon the Fees both of <hi>Physician</hi> &amp; <hi>Lawyer,</hi> which
they dare not surpasse; Touching the other part, they
are but clinches and passages of Drollery, nor do Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians
much value such gingling <hi>conceits</hi> all the while
they finger our <hi>coyn,</hi> for all the world doth grant,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98502:49"/>
that the study of Physic is both <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>necessary,</hi>
and 'tis the chiefest kind of Learning, for therby a man
comes to know himself; For the Physitian can say
more truly than any other, <hi>Nosco meipsum.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mule.</speaker>
               <p>Though Physitians know themselfs never so well
and the constitution of their bodies, yet when they
are sick they commonly take their Receipts by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of others, being distrustfull of themselfs;
And whereas you say, the practise of Physic is <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
I remember to have read, that the point was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
before Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth, and canvased
to and fro, som alledging that Physitians were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
and not <hi>necessary</hi> for a Common-wealth,
because <hi>Rome</hi> stood and flourished many hundred
years before the use of Physic was first introduc'd,
during which time men never liv'd more healthfull
and longer; His Holines opinion being desired at last,
he said, he was for the affirmatif, and that he held
<hi>Physicians</hi> to be absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> for a Common-wealth,
in regard that <hi>were it not for physicians the world
wold be so thick of peeple, that one could not live for another:</hi>
Intimating therby that the <hi>Physitians</hi> help to make
them away.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>Yet your experience tells you, that the <hi>Physicall Art</hi>
is noble, and one of the seven liberall Sciences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of undoubted and certain Principles, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a world of Naturall knowledg.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mule.</speaker>
               <p>Ther is <hi>Therapeutic</hi> or contemplative Physic, ther is
<hi>Diagnostic</hi> or knowing, and ther is <hi>Prognostic</hi> Physic;
If we consider <hi>Physic</hi> as she is a <hi>Seience,</hi> she hath most
tru and certain Aphorisms, for she considers onely
<hi>Universalls,</hi> which are eternall and invariable, and
breed certitudes in us, because she arrives to the
knowledg of things by their causes, and so she may
be called <hi>Scientificall,</hi> and appertains to contemplation,
whose onely scope is to discover <hi>Tnuth</hi> singly of it self;
But if we consider <hi>Physic</hi> as an <hi>Art,</hi> which proceeds
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98502:49"/>
from experience and action, she is incertain and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious
in her operations, in regard of the various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of human bodies, for those Drugs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
which do work kindly with som bodies, find
crosse operations in others, and many times the tru
symptoms of the disease is not known; Moreover we
administer to others what we never take our selfs,
which made a great aged <hi>Physician,</hi> being asked how
he came to live so long, to answer, I have liv'd so long
because never any Drug entred into my guts; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
when any Pill or Potion hath a kindly opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Patient, it is as much by hap as by any good
cunning; What a nomber of remedies are ther for one
onely disease? whence may be inferred, that ther is
not any one peculiar infallible remedy; Insomuch
that when the Physitian applies Universalls to Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
and administers any Purgation, Vomit, or
Electuary, it is requisit that both the Physician and
Patient be fortunat, ther is a kind of <hi>happines</hi> required
in the busines; Add hereunto, that the complexion of
men and women are so diffring, their appetite so ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
and disordinat, that it makes all Physicall
operations to be so incertain; Now touching the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Us <hi>Sensitive</hi> cretures, they are of so even &amp; strong
complexions, their appetites are so regular, their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triments
and food, their drinks are so simple, that
they need not any physicall Drugs; Wheras among
Mankind, they make ever and anon an Apothecary's
shop of their bellies, being still in a course of Physic,
which makes them so miserable, for it is a tru pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>Qui vivit medicè, vivit miserè;</hi> Therefore a
kind of Tragicall speech was that of <hi>Alexander the
Great,</hi> when upon expiring his last, he cried out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but then in the Meridian of his age, <hi>Pereo turbâ
Medicorum,</hi> I perish by too many Physitians.</p>

               <p>It begets much wonder in me that you should thus
traduce your own Calling, and derogate from so
learned and laudable a Profession, a Faculty that
hath been always accounted to have a high kind of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98502:50"/>
Divinity in it, being founded by <hi>Apollo</hi> himself.</p>

               <p>In the shape I now wear, I cannot lye nor flatter,
I can neither cogg, <hi>cageòle,</hi> nor complement, as I did
when I was a man, when I used ever and anon to <hi>kiss
those hands which I wish'd in my thoughts had been cut off,</hi>
my heart and my toung lying now more levell and
even, ther's nearer relation betwixt them; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what I told you before was truth, simple truth,
wherin the <hi>Brute</hi> Animal goes beyond the <hi>Rational,</hi>
who is subject to innumerable errors, dissimulations,
and the humor of lying.</p>
               <p>But to enlarge my self a little further upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
subject of <hi>Physic,</hi> which you call so <hi>learned</hi> an Art,
you know that <hi>every one is a Fool or a Physitian</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
naturally, after he hath passed the Meridian of his
years, therfore what great learning can ther be in
this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis much truth; I have heard of divers irrational
cretures that are learned this way, who by the
meer instinct and conduct of nature, can direct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs
to things that can cure them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mule.</speaker>
               <p>This cannot be denied, and therin many of them
are more <hi>sagacious</hi> than <hi>men;</hi> The Serpent goes to
<hi>Fenell</hi> when he would clear his sight, or cast off his
old scruffy skin to wear a new one; The Stagg, Buck,
or Doe, when they are hurt have recourse to <hi>Dittany;</hi>
The Swallow when she finds her young ones have
sore eyes, makes use of <hi>Celandine,</hi> or Swallow-wort;
The Snail heals her self with <hi>Hemlock;</hi> the Wesill,
when she prepares to fight with the Mole, useth to
raise her spirits by eating <hi>Rue;</hi> The Stork heals all his
infirmities with <hi>Origanum;</hi> The wild Boar with <hi>Ivy;</hi>
The Elephant fenceth himself from the poison of
the Camelion with <hi>Olive leaves;</hi> The Bear makes use
of <hi>Mandragora</hi> against Pismires; The Patridge and
wild Pidgeon do use to purge their superfluities with
<hi>Bay-leaves;</hi> The Dogg, when he feels himself indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98502:50"/>
in his stomack, runs to the <hi>green grasse</hi> a little
bedewed, &amp;c. But what need I detain you with more
instances? take any <hi>sensitive</hi> creture you please, and
you will find, that Nature hath taught him a remedy
against all infirmities that are incident unto him, not
onely to the species but to every Individuall, and all
this without any expence of time or tresure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any study or labour, without any fee or reward,
without any teaching or instructions from others;
Whence 'tis apparent, that Nature is more carefull
and indulgent of Us than of Ratinall cretures, who
though they are subject to a thousand infirmities
more, yet not one in a thousand knowes how to cure
himself; but he must have recourse to the Physician,
and so trusts him with his life, and if he chance to
work a cure upon him, he useth to give his purse a
purgation also, for <hi>Though God heals, yet the Physitian
carries away the Fees.</hi>

of the inward man is greater, the anxieries and

things, and fits of despair work somtimes so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
that he becomes <hi>Felo de se,</hi> making him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
himself, and cut off the threed of his life before
<hi>Lachesis</hi> hath wound it half up; And were ther a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician

a word, will you embrace this comfortable proffer I
make you from the gratious Queen <hi>Morphandra,</hi> and
turn <hi>Tumontian</hi> again?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mule.</speaker>
               <p>Truly Sir I have neither mind nor maw to it, for
in the state wherin I am setled, I use to exercise the
operations of nature with more freedom, and much
lesse encumbrance, following onely the dictats of
sense, and being solely guided therby.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>But what are the dictats of sense, compar'd with
the intellectuall powers of the human soul? what is
the <hi>Sense</hi> which trades alone with grosse bodies, and
qualities emergent thence, compar'd with <hi>Reson,</hi> a
faculty wherby the soul converseth with blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and immateriat Beeings, and by Metaphysicall
and sublime notions wings her self up into the arms
of Him who breath'd her first into the body of man?
In the upper Court of the Soul's residence, we may
compare the Soul to an Empresse, wisely restraining
or giving freedom to the misguided affections, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98502:52"/>
to the exact rules of Reson; Here we have
Man ruling in Man, dressing and manuring Man as
another Paradise, wherin is all possible variety, yet
no confusion, no disorder, no unruly passions tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing
over Reson, no disturbance of mind, no distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of body, but a most admirable harmony of all
things in the whole Universe of Man; <hi>Reson</hi> is that
Diadem wherby the soul doth rule and regulat the
will, and the affections, the Chancellor which doth
moderat the motions of both; <hi>Reson</hi> is that Rod
wherwith the Soul is kept in awe to obey, without any
servile fear, her Creator and chiefest Good; By <hi>Reson</hi>
the Soul discerns ther is a God, deducing arguments
from the Creation of the fair fabric of the world,
which had either existence from it self, or was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by another; but it could not give a first beeing
to it self, in regard 'tis repugnant to the principles of
Nature, that any thing should be the cause of it self;
Therfore the Inference is undeniable, that the world
was made by another which was pre-existent, and
such another that was the Efficient cause therof, not
produced by any other former efficient cause, but was
of Himself, and by Himself from eternity, which can
be no other than God; Another argument the Soul
drawes from the necessary dependance of a finit Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon an Infinit, for all created natures are finit,
both in respect of their essence, and operations; Now,
every thing that is finit must necessarily be limited
by another, seeing it is impossible that any thing
shold give bounds to it self; And ther being not in
things finit a progresse to Infinity, We must at length
come to some certain Independent Beeing, which is
not circumscrib'd or limited by another, but is of it
self essentially and virtually infinit, which can be no
other than God Almighty; A third argument is
drawn from the necessary dependance of a <hi>Secondary</hi>
cause upon a <hi>First,</hi> for unlesse we do here also grant
a progresse to Infinity, which is absurd in mounting
up the scale of subordination of causes, we must at
length meet with one primary both Efficient and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98502:53"/>
cause, that hath no other cause superiour or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
unto it, which is onely God: Another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Soul draweth, still by the ministry of <hi>Reson,</hi>
to prove a Deity, is the constant cours of the Starrs,
those glorious Luminaries, and the continued order of
all things else in their first station, through all the
vicissitudes of corruption and generation, which doth
forcibly intimat an ubiquitary Providence, a wise
Rector, Governor, and Commander, upon whose di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
all things depend; No sooner doth the Soul
by such reaches of Reson throughly satisfie her self
that ther is a God, but she mounts yet higher, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to know what God is; But such is the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
refulgence of his Majesty, that she finds it
impossible to look God in the face, or to know him
<hi>à priori;</hi> yet though she is not able to behold his face,
yet she hath leave granted to know him <hi>à posteriori,</hi>
though she cannot <hi>define</hi> the incomprehensible Deity,
yet she may still, guided by light of Reson, <hi>describe</hi>
him by an aggregation of Attributes? To know God
by his Attributes is a near approach to his Deity;
Yet the Rationall soul goes still nearer, first prying
into his Essence, then returning to her self, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
which way she should know more, at length
she says within her self, <hi>Operatio sequitur Esse,</hi> Action
follows its Being; Then she busies her self in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of Gods <hi>Actions,</hi> which she finds either
<hi>immanent</hi> and inward, or <hi>transient</hi> and outward; The
<hi>immanent</hi> actions of God are such as are performed
intrinsecally within Himself, without any externall
respect to the creture, wherby he is said to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plat,
to know, and love Himself; Here the Soul takes
notice of a reflection of the Deity upon it self, and so
is heightned to the supposition of a <hi>Trinity,</hi> the cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and abstrusest point, the highest pitch she can
soar unto; She proceeds to argue, that wheras God
doth conceive and know Himself, he doth beget a
perfect Image of Himself, from which issueth a perfect
Love of Himself, and a complacency; Now, seeing
ther is nothing in God which is not God, both the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98502:53"/>
Image of God, and the Love of God seem to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Subsistences of the same Essence with Him from
whom they proceed, as when an Eye doth see it self,
ther is first the Eye seeing, secondly, the Eye seen, or
at least the Image of the eye seen, from which acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of seeing her arises a desire of enjoyment; This
comparison doth in some sort adumbrat the <hi>blessed
Trinity;</hi> First, ther is the Eye; Secondly, ther is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
or Image of the Eye; Thirdly, ther is
a love or complacency which proceeds from both;
The first is God the Father, the Second is God the
Son, and the third is God the Holy Ghost; Now, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
these three Subsistencies be all concentred in
the Deity, yet they are distinct each one from the other
in their operations <hi>ad extra,</hi> though in immanent,
or in actions <hi>ad intra,</hi> they are individuall: Thus the
Human Soul ascends to the knowledge of her Eternall
Good, by the ministry and reaches of <hi>Reson,</hi> therfore
me-thinks you should have an Ambition to be endued
with that divine Faculty again, and so return to your
native soyl from this society of irrationall brute
Animals, and be a subject to so great a Monarch as the
<hi>Tumontian</hi> King is, your naturall liege Lord and
Prince, whose Dominions are of such a vast expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that they reach to the very Antipodes, the other
Hemisphere of the world, whereby he may say, that
the Sun never sets, but shines upon som part or other
of his Territories every hour of the naturall day, all
the while <hi>Apollo</hi> fetches a carreer about the world.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mule.</speaker>
               <p>Touching the first part of this your last discours,
wherin you so much magnifie the faculty of <hi>Reson,</hi> and
that therby you arrive to the notion of heavenly
things, truly Sir, I am of his opinion who held, that
<hi>all the knowledg which man hath of his Creator is but one
degree above blindnesse;</hi> What the eye of a Batt is to the
Sun in its Meridian, the same is the most perspicacious
eye of man's understanding if he look upon his Maker:
In the state that now I live do not puzzle my brain
with such presumptuous reserches and incertain spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98502:54"/>
but am contented with the doctrin and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctamens
of <hi>Sense</hi> onely, which are more infallible.</p>
               <p>Concerning the last part of your speech, it cannot
be denied but that the <hi>Tumontian</hi> King is one of the
greatest Potentats that ever was upon earth, if his
Dominions were contiguous and united, but ther is
such an unsociable distance between them, that the
<hi>Artonian</hi> will tell you, <hi>His Monarchy is like a great
Cloak made up of patches;</hi> Moreover, I have no great
comfort to be his subject now, because he hath gon
down the wind for many years, having bin so shreud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shaken in the saddle, most of that Country you
spoke of which reacheth to the Antipodes being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
from him, and he hath very lately disgorged
many a good bit to <hi>Artonia:</hi> Add hereunto, that his
peeple in <hi>Tumontia</hi> are grown miserably poor of late
years by such insupportable Taxes, and drainings of
men for the Warrs, insomuch that ther are scarce
enough left to cultivat the earth: Yet such is the rare
obedience, and the phlegmatic humor of the <hi>Tumon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
that they are still as awfull, they are as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
and quiet, as if ther King were as vertuous,
as victorious, and the least exacter the ever Prince
was; But this they do for their own advantage, for
if there were another Governor set up, it wold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably
hurl the whole Country into civill tumults
and combustion, &amp; so the remedy wold be worse than
the disease.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>They shew themselfs a prudent peeple in that, for
it is in Governments as it is in choice of wifes, <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
comes a better;</hi> But the <hi>Tumontian</hi> hath other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
qualities, for besides his constant obedience
to his Prince, He is also constant to his Religion, he is
in perpetuall enmity with the common enemy of the
Crosse, Moreover he never serves any Prince in the
warrs but his own, nor goes he to trade abroad into
and Country but to his own Masters Territories: And
are not you desirous to be one of that brave Nation
again? Therfore let me advise you now once for all,
to shake off that dull despicable shape, which useth,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98502:54"/>
in naturall production to have no better mother then
an Asse.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mule.</speaker>
               <p>Truly Sir, you may please (as the proverb runs)
to keep your breath to cool your pattage, and spend
it no longer upon me, for I am resolved to live and die
in this shape; But wheras you brand it with the term
of <hi>despicable,</hi> I wold have you know, that our bodies
have more vertues far in them than <hi>Man</hi>'s, and
wherof <hi>Man</hi> makes common use towards his health:
Our very <hi>foam</hi> drunk in warm wine is good against
pursines; Som of our <hi>hairs</hi> mingled with those of an
Asse and dried, and so put to a perfume, are good
against the Epilepsie, The <hi>milt</hi> of one of us is good
against the Falling-evill, nay the very dust wherin
one of us hath tumbled, is good to mitigate the ardors
of Love, being sprinkled upon the body; But take
heed how you anger us, for our bitings are poysonous:
We have sundry other medicinall vertues, which I
will here pretermit; Therefore whereas you call this
species of ours <hi>despicable,</hi> we deserve rather more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
considering the said vertues; Insomuch that if I
should exchange this shape for man's, I should prove
a greater fool than that <hi>Mule</hi> in the Fable, who seeing
a goodly barb'd Horse going to the Warrs, and saying
within himself, It may be that gallant Horse and I had
the same mother, therfore why shold not I have so
much courage and stoutnes in me? I wold I had such
a rider, such a great saddle, trappings and arms to
try my courage; But seeing the Horse led back in the
evening all bloody and wounded, he repented himself
of his former foolish wish.</p>

transform'd from a Merchant to that species;
This Section treats of divers things, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

               <p>MOst admired Queen, I render you my most
humble acknowledgments for the continuance
of your great favors towards me, which I am now in
half-despair that I shall not be able to make use of
for perfecting my designs upon these brute Animals;
Touching this last, I find in him also an aversnes both
to his first <hi>Constitution,</hi> to his <hi>Country,</hi> and to his <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi>
Concerning the first, he complains of the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berles
diseases which are incident to every part of
that Microcosm of Man, as also the various and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
distempers of the mind, with the stings of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which brute Animals are not subject unto,
&amp;c. Touching the second, <hi>viz.</hi> his Country, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs
against the craggy swellings of it, the excesse
of heat, and consequently the sterilities of it, which
is such, that ther is not a competency of <hi>bread</hi> (which
is the <hi>staff</hi> of life) for the twentieth man that breaths
in it, &amp;c. Touching the third, <hi>viz.</hi> His former <hi>Calling,</hi>
he complains of the incertainties, the sordidnesse, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98502:55"/>
a kind of Atheism that it is subject unto, for while the
<hi>Physician</hi> tampers so much with second causes, it brings
him to a forgetfulness of the first, &amp;c. But, Madame, I
desire to try conclusions upon som nimbler and witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

               <p>You shall be partaker of your desires presently, for
I espy a <hi>Fox</hi> near that hedge who was a <hi>Saturnian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
born in <hi>Rugilia,</hi> whom for his cunningnes in
negotiating, and for som Hocos-pocos and Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bankish
tricks I transformed to a <hi>Fox,</hi> who you know
is the most politic, the wittiest and wiliest of all Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedalls,
wherof ther are multitudes of examples;
One time he cosen'd the <hi>Crow,</hi> who having got a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of green cheese, and being perch'd upon the bough
of an Oak to eat it, a <hi>Fox</hi> perceiving it went under
the tree, and stood gazing upon the <hi>Crow,</hi> saying,
What a base lying thing is common fame, who saies
that thou art a black ill-favour'd Bird? truly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
thou art the fairest that ever I saw, and couldst
thou but sing as others do, thou deserv'st to be Queen
of Birds; The <hi>Crow</hi> being tickled with these praises
fell a opening her beak, so down fell the cheese, and
the <hi>Fox</hi> made merry with it; But he was more wily
with the <hi>Wolf,</hi> for a <hi>Fox</hi> having got into a Farmers
yard, and skulking up and down in a Moon-shine
night, ther being a well in the yard he peep'd into it,
and the reflex of the Moon being in the water, he
thought it was a new cheese, therupon he whip'd
into one of the buckets, and down he went to feed
upon it; Being in that plunge, it chanc'd that a <hi>Wolf</hi>
came also skulking therabouts for his prey, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
into the well, the <hi>Fox</hi> cries out, O brother <hi>Wolf,</hi>
her's most dainty cheer, and ther's enough for us
both; so the <hi>Wolf</hi> leaping into the other bucket drew
up the <hi>Fox,</hi> who being got on the top, and he in the
bottom of the well said, Farewell brother <hi>wolf,</hi> and
much good may the new cheese do unto you, so he
got free, leaving another in his room; He was also
too hard for the <hi>Lion,</hi> who as he is King of Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedalls,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98502:56"/>
having put forth a Proclamation, that all
horned beasts shold give attendance at Court on such
a day to a great Feast, (though his plot was to prey on
them) the <hi>Ass</hi> meeting with a <hi>Fox</hi> said, Come let's go
to Court to see the great shew, for if ther shold be
any danger we are free from it, in regard we have
no horns, though sufficient ears; I, quoth the <hi>Fox,</hi> but
if <hi>the Lion saies that our ears be horns, they must be horns;</hi>
Moreover I have observ'd the tracks of many beasts
going into the Lion's Cave but none comming back:
This was onely <hi>caution,</hi> but it was a trick of wit that
the <hi>Fox</hi> plaid with the <hi>Eagle,</hi> who having got one of
his young Cubbs, and carried it to the top of a high
tree where his nest was, to prey upon it, the <hi>Fox</hi> got
a brand or two of fire and put it to the trunck of the
tree, which so scar'd the <hi>Eagle,</hi> that he brought down
the young Cubb and laid it in the place he found it;
How commonly doth the <hi>Fox</hi> cosen both Huntsman
and Dogg, when being poursued he useth to get into
a plowed field, and stretching himself all along in a
furrow he often scapes, his skin and the earth being of
a colour; Therfore you may make triall now upon a
brute Animal that hath some sagacity and wit, as
well as activity.</p>

               <p>Truly no, for here I live in a better <hi>Country,</hi> in a

<hi>Saturnia.</hi>
               </p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fox.</speaker>
               <p>Touching the first, wheras you magnifie <hi>Saturnia</hi>
so much for her fertility, let me tell you, that to my
knowledg ther be divers parts of her so barren and
desolat, that you shall not meet with a house in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
miles riding; <hi>Rugilia,</hi> that part wherin I came first
into the world, may be call'd nothing else but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
of Rocks and Craggs; In som places you may
see three Marquisses on one tree gathering Figgs to keep
them from starving: They bragg of a River that
hath Junkets in her, som Comfits, some Plumms, som
Cinnamon, but these Junkets are but white stones
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98502:57"/>
bearing the shape of all these; Ther's no Country hath
more <hi>Tempests,</hi> more Tremblings and Earthquakes,
wherof ther have been very lately such formidable
examples of utter desolation and subversion of twenty
Towns; There is part of the Country which is under
a perpetual shadowy darknesse or <hi>adumbration,</hi> whence
the whole Province takes its denomination; Ther's
no Clime under the convex of Heven where Meteors
and fulgurations are more impetuous and violent.</p>
               <p>Touching the second, which was my former <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
ther's a thing called <hi>Conscience</hi> which us'd to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize
and torture me when I was a <hi>Man,</hi> I often
found within me a gnawing worm, I often felt sore
stings, sore pricks, and remorses of the said Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which the Theologues call <hi>Synteresis,</hi> that ever
and anon did discompose the quietude of my thoughts,
and disturb me in my gaining profession; But in this
state I am free from such perplexities, for now,
though I suck the blood of twenty Geese a day, and
destroy whole roosts of Hens, the thing call'd <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
never troubles me. Moreover, besides this rack
of Conscience, ther is a vice call'd <hi>Covetousnes</hi> that
<hi>Man</hi> is subject unto, and when all other vices grow
old in him, this vice growes younger and younger.
I remember I was slavishly addicted hereunto, I
would have flayed a louse could I have made benefit
of her skin, but now I am free from that fordid
vice, from that kind of idolatry, for according
to the saying, he is the worse Idolater who adores
Gold, for he may be said therby to worship the Devil,
for <hi>Pluto</hi> is the god of Riches; In the shape I bear, I
covet no more but what wil satisfie nature only: Ther
is another cursed and cruciatory humor call'd <hi>Iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi>
which much afflicts Mankind, and it reigns more
amongst that Nation I was once of than among any
other; Jealousie among the thoughts is like Batts
among birds, it doth mightily discompose the whole
inward man, and disturb the tranquillity of his mind,
nay it hurls him often upon desperat and bloody at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>

Touching the third, which is <hi>Company,</hi> I have now
far better, conversing with these innocuous and simple
Animals. The society of men is much more dangerous,
specially of my quondam <hi>Country-men,</hi> for upon any
occasion of distast one is in danger of a <hi>Saturnian</hi> Figg,
or to be poyson'd by the smoak of a candle, by the
suavity of a flower, or by a glove or handkerchief;
For four or five Duckets reward, one may be master of
any man's life in som places of <hi>Saturnia,</hi> for he will
find a mercenary instrument to murther any body;
Add hereunto, that my Country-men are full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and vindicatif in the highest degree, they will
seldom suffer one to do them a second wrong, but
dispatch him away to the other world, which is the
occasion of a saying, <hi>Take heed of a slow Foe in Saturnia,
and of a sudden Friend in Artonia;</hi> I could give you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
examples hereof, but I will produce onely two;
In <hi>Marcopolis,</hi> the greatest <hi>Mart</hi> of the Western world,
(though two of her chiefest be but <hi>brittle</hi> Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<hi>viz. Lasses</hi> and <hi>Glasses</hi>) ther were two rich
Merchants who had been partners a long time, it
chanced that one of them knowing the other to be
over familiar with his wife, he dissembled his passion
a great while, till his thoughts had contriv'd and
concluded a revenge upon him, so he solemnly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his partner to a Feast, and after dinner he led him
to a Garden that he had by the Sea-side, being there
alone together he brought him to an Arbor, where
among divers other rarities ther was a curious new
large Chari made with such artifice, that when one
had put himself to sit in it, ther were certain gins and
vices wold suddenly rise up and clasp in his body both
arms and thighs; His Partner being thus lockt fast in
the Chair, he presently gaggs him, and having lockt
the Garden dore, he drew a great double-edg'd knife,
and being upon the point of stabbing him, the Partner
said, Oh be not so inhuman and barbarously cruell as
to kill me before confession, therfore have som com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration
on my soul; Well, replied the murtherer,
if thou wilt do one thing, I may spare thee thy life,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98502:58"/>
which is, If thou wilt defie the holy Trinity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all hopes of salvation in it, &amp;c. The Partner
(in hopes of future repentance to expiat his offence)
repeated those words three times, and the third time
as soon as he had done repeating them, he stabb'd
him in the breast, and cleft his heart in two, and so
threw his body into the Sea to make food for Hadocks;
But a while after his body being retreev'd and taken
up in a fisher-net just under that wall, the murther
was discover'd, and the murtherer being put upon
the Strapado he confessed all, and going up the Gibbe
to be executed, he broke out into a great fit of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
His ghostly Father and Confessor telling him, that
he was now going to give account of that horrid mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had committed before the great Judge of the
world, therfore that passion of laughter did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com
him; Oh, said he, whensoever I think upon that
full revenge I had of that villain, my heart danceth
within me for joy, for <hi>I was not onely reveng'd upon his
body but also upon his soul,</hi> in which humor he breath'd
his last.</p>
               <p>Another was as bloody, if not more; In the antient
City of <hi>Cerano,</hi> ther was a Prince who left three sons
behind him, <hi>Conradus, Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Alexander; Conradus</hi>
was us'd to come from his palace in the Country to
his Castle in <hi>Cerano,</hi> where he had appointed a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
and a Garrison of souldiers; The Governor
having a comly Lady to his wife, the young Prince
was struck in love with her, and at last enjoyed her;
The Governour having knowledge therof did me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditat
upon a revenge, therupon he sent to <hi>Conradus</hi>
(his Lord and Master) that he had lately discover'd
two or three wild <hi>Boars</hi> in the Forest of <hi>Cerano,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if his Highnesse would please to com thither to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his two brothers, ther wold be very
Princely sport for them, and he wold prepare all
things ready for the Game; Hereupon the young
Prince and his second Brother comming thither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
for that sport, it chanced that <hi>Alexander</hi> the
youngest brother was then out of the way; So the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98502:58"/>
of the Castle having provided a plentifull sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the two Princes and their Retinue, being both
gone to bed, he calls his Officers together, and told
them, Gentlemen, what does he deserve, who for
many good services and hospitalities done unto him,
doth in lieu of thanks abuse ones wife, and defiles his
bed? They all cried out, He deserves death; Truly
Gentlemen, thus hath Prince <hi>Conradus</hi> us'd me; They
cried out again, Let him die, and we will stick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and be faithfull; So the Governor taking som
of those Officers with him in the dead of night,
they broke suddenly into the chamber where <hi>Conradus</hi>
was asleep, and heaving up the bed-cloaths, they first
cut off his privy-members, then they chop'd off his
head, then they quarter'd his body, and strewed them
up and down the chamber; So all was hush'd that
night; Prince <hi>Caesar</hi> comming to wait on his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the next morning, the Governor usher'd him in,
and seeing his Brother's head bleeding on the window,
and his limbs scatter'd up and down the room, he
said, Oh! is this the wild Boar you writ to him of?
Yes, said the Governour, and I remember I writ of
two or three; Hereupon he was also knock'd down,
and us'd in the same manner? The Tragedy being
acted thus far, he takes his Officers, and going upon
the Castle walls, he sent to speak with the Syndic
and Burgesses of the Town, unto whom he made a
Speech, that they had been a long time in servitude or
a kind of slavery to <hi>Conradus</hi> and that Family, and
now ther was a fair opportunity offered for them to
redeem their liberties, for he had <hi>Conradus</hi> and his
Brother in his custody, and the Officers with the rest
of the Garrison were inclin'd to do them away, if the
Town wold joyn with them; But the Town shewing
an aversnes, or rather a detestation of such disloyalty
and treason, sent to Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> the youngest
Brother, and the Citizens of <hi>Cerano</hi> joyning with the
forces he brought with him to expiat his Brother's
bloods, they beleaguer the Castle round; Therupon
the Governor taking his wife and children with him
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98502:59"/>
to the top of the highest Turret, he first threw down
headlong his wife, then his three children, and last
of all he precipitates himself, and so the Tragedy
ended.</p>

               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>A Tragedy indeed, and one of the direfullest that
ever I heard of; It must be granted, that the <hi>Saturnian</hi>
spirit is much bent upon revenges, he is in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
commonly, <hi>Quod vult valde vult, quod odit val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
odit;</hi> vertues and vices are there in the Superlative
degree: But truly if the vertues and vices of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Nation were weighed in a ballance, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
the first wold out-poise the second, for ther
might be more instances of actions of high vertu pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
than of vice; I will make mention of one, and
that a very modern one, and no Romance; Ther was
in the antient Amphitheatricall City of <hi>Rovena</hi> a
young Marquis, who fell desperatly in love with a
Merchant's wife, he courted her a long time but
could not prevail, at last, the Merchant having a <hi>Villa</hi>
or Country-house, whither he was gone a while for
divertisment, the Marquis went a Hawking ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
one day, and letting his Hawk fly of purpose
into the Merchant's Orchard, he and his men rid lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after her, and retreeved her in the Orchard where
the Marquis himself was entred, having obtain'd
leave before; The Hawk being found, the Merchant
invites the Marquis to a Treatment, where his wife
was present, and very officious to please; Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
she asks her husband who he was? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
'Tis the Marquis of such a place, one of the
gallantest and most hopefull young Noblemen in all
<hi>Saturnia,</hi> a person full of transcendent parts and high
perfections, &amp;c. These praises making deep impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in his wife, and the Marquis poursuing still his
design, he at last prevailed, and being admitted to her
chamber by a back Garden-dore, he found her a bed,
and in a fit posture to receive him; so unbracing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to go to her, and having put off his doublet, she
told him smilingly, Do you know whom you may
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98502:59"/>
thank most for this courtesie? It is my husband, who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
after the late Treatment you had, fell a long time into
such high commendations of you, that I never heard
him speak so nobly of any: The Marquis being put to
a sudden stand hereby, and struck with a kind of asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
put on his doublet again and his cloak,
saying, Shall I abuse so worthy a friend, and such
noble affections? No, I will die first; So taking his
leave of the Lady in civill and thankfull posture, he
departed the same way he was let in, and never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
her again.</p>

               <p>Truly it cannot be denied, but this was a most sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
example of continence, and no lesse of gratitude,
to restrain himself so in the height of such a lust.</p>

               <p>Well, will you conform your self to my advice,
and turn Man, and Merchant, to converse again with
such a noble Nation, a Nation that may prescribe
rules of prudence and <hi>policy</hi> to all Mankind?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fox.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, you speak of Policy, ther is no tru policy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
now adaies in the world, it is degenerated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the nature of man into subtlety and craft;
If ther be any left 'tis in <hi>Marcopolis,</hi> where ther are
the truest Patriots and most public Souls that I have
known remaining amongst men, otherwise she had
never been able to tugg so long with the huge <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manto
Empire,</hi> and other the greatest Potentats, upon
earth; Yet somtimes she hath us'd to sow such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Tail as mine</hi> to her <hi>Lions skin,</hi> and proceed by
craft as well as by strength; Now, though <hi>Policy</hi> and
<hi>Craft</hi> agree in their <hi>Ends,</hi> yet they differ in the <hi>Means</hi>
conducing to their Ends; The one proceeds by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and gallant manly waies to attain her ends,
the other by dishonourable and base subdolous ways,
she cares not what Oaths she swallows and breaks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
she cares not what lies, fears, and jealousies
she creates to amuse the silly vulgar, and therby to
incite them to Arms and Rebellion, for tearing the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98502:60"/>
bowells of their own Country, and to loose all alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to their natural Prince; She makes no scruple or
conscience to make <hi>Religion</hi> her Mantle to palliat all
her designs, and by a horrid kind of prophanenes and
blasphemy to make God Almighty the Author of all
Rebellions and Sedition: As was lately practised in
<hi>Gheriona</hi> more then in any other Country that ever
was under the cope of Heven; And now ther's a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of poor Sir politic Woodbies or Wise-akers,
that wold put a <hi>Cats head upon a Lions neck,</hi> they wold
make a petty <hi>Common-wealth</hi> such as that of <hi>Hydraulia,</hi>
of that antient spacious Monarchy with the Crowns
thereunto annexed, Kingdoms which have lasted thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of years without any <hi>Interregnums</hi> at all till
now; And observable it is, that among other <hi>benefits</hi>
(or <hi>plagues</hi> rather) which <hi>Gheriona</hi> hath received from
<hi>Hydraulia</hi> for raising her first to a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> from
obedience to her hereditary Prince, one is, that she
hath poysoned <hi>Gheriona</hi> in her <hi>Policy</hi> as well as in her
<hi>Religion;</hi> For now she hath the fate to have such
Wise-askers in Government that can see afar off no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to the tips of their noses; They wold take
down the <hi>Royal Saddle, and clap a pair of Panniers on Ghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riona's
back,</hi> never looking forward what will follow,
<hi>viz.</hi> an everlasting Warr; Nor do they fall to any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
what a disparagement it will be, that so large
and noble a Kingdom shold be cast into so petty a
mould as that of <hi>Hydraulia,</hi> who is above thirty times
inferiour to <hi>Gheriona</hi> in extent of Territory, and more
then forty times in point of Plenty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>It is a clear truth what you affirm, that tru Policy
is much sophisticated in this latter age, and touching
the hints you give of <hi>Gheriona</hi> in point of Government,
and the present designes that are afoot to transverse it,
I know to Country full well; It may be a feasable
thing to turn the great City <hi>Polihaima</hi> to a kind of
Common-wealth, for she hath smelt a great while of
a <hi>Hans</hi> in regard of her many Corporations, which
may be said to be petty Republiques of themselfs;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98502:60"/>
but for <hi>Gheriona</hi> her self, it will be a hard confused
task to reduce her to such a Government, it being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible
both with the Genius of the Peeple, the
Posture of the Country, and Politicall Constitutions
established there for so many Ages; They who make
inspections into the influxes and vertu of Heavenly
Bodies, find, that <hi>Mars</hi> is the Planet predominant
over <hi>Gheriona,</hi> and 'tis observed, that where <hi>he</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominats,
that Clime and Country is fit for no other
Government than Monarchall; Whereas those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
where the <hi>Moon</hi> is predominant, as <hi>Marcopolis</hi>
and others, are naturally fittest to be made <hi>Republiques;</hi>
Therefore let those men, who have now the vogue
of Power and Counsell in <hi>Gheriona,</hi> beat their brains
never so much, let them scrue up their wits, and
stretch all the policy they have as far as possibly they
can, yet they will never be able to constitute a lasting
durable Government, or settle a firm and generall
Peace without a <hi>King,</hi> that kind of Supream Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
is congeniall with the Nation it self, which will
never be fixed till then; Therfore, as I said before, let
those men who are now upon the Stage of Power,
winde up their wits as high as they can, without this
they will be still at a losse, their consultations will be
like a skein of ravell'd silk, they will be in a labyrinth
of confusions, and the end of one will be still the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of another.</p>
               <p>Now, ther is no <hi>Art</hi> so incertain, so subject to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
as the <hi>Art for Man to rule Man;</hi> Ther be many
poor Sciolists in <hi>Gheriona,</hi> who of late years have shot at
rovers in prescribing Rules of Government, they take
the ashes of the <hi>Iudaicall,</hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
to apply them to the present times,
wheras those Nations were of another temper, of
other Religions, and consequently of other kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectualls,
and diffring Idaeas to the present Age;
They shold rather produce examples from <hi>Gheriona</hi>'s
own Historians, which wold be far more suitable; But
go to the chiefest Politians, Antient or Modern, that ever
writ of Governments, you will find all their opinions
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98502:61"/>
concenter in this point, That ther is no Government
which hath a nearer analogy with that of Heven, that
is more lasting upon earth, that is more regular, or that
hath any certain principles, but <hi>Monarchy;</hi> That great
Chair-man or Grandee among Philosophers, <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
in his Politiques, upon which ther is such a world of
Comments, speaks of sundry species of Governments,
as <hi>Aristocracy, Democracy, Oligarchy,</hi> and <hi>Stratocracy,</hi>
but he puts no Rules for any, onely he hath this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
that <hi>Aristocracy</hi> or <hi>Optimacy</hi> allows no <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
or Mechanick to be a Cittizen or Counsellor;</hi> Much of
his discourse is of the first Founders of Common-wealths,
then he proceeds to correct the errors of
Common-wealths, before he tells us what a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
is; Moreover, in handling the kinds of
Government in generall, he flies forward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in a disorderly way, but when he descends to
particular forms, he is full, not onely of confusion,
but contradictions and inconstancies to himself; In
som places he seems to deny any naturall <hi>Right,</hi> much
more any <hi>Majesty</hi> to be in the <hi>People,</hi> whom <hi>he holds to
be little inferiour to Beasts;</hi> Wheras else-where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth
a liberty to every City to set up what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
they please, either by Force or Craft, which
in effect is to allow the Peeple to do what they list, if
they be able. Now this high-reaching Philosopher
cannot much be censured for roving up and down in
so incertain a subject, it being impossible for any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
brain to prescribe any infallible universall Rules
for Government, that may quadrat with the nature
of all Climes and Seasons, and be appliable to the
humors of all Peeple; Other Sciences have Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
and undeniable Principles, but the Art of
Government hath no such Maxims, in regard of a
thousand sort of contingencies that attend human ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations,
as also for the various dispositions of pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
som Nations are so fiery mouth'd, that they must
be ridd with a Bitt, if not with a Curb and Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale,
but a small Bridle will serve others, nor are the
same Constitutions fit for a <hi>Continent</hi> that are proper
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98502:61"/>
for an <hi>Iland,</hi> nor those of a <hi>Maritim</hi> Continent fit for a
<hi>Mediterranean</hi> Country, who know not what salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fox.</speaker>
               <p>Touching those modern Smatterers in Policy you
speak of, the times abound with such, such that while
they take upon them to give Precepts for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
they amuse the Reader with Universalls,
(and commonly ther is deceit in Universalls) or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they lead him to a labyrinth of distinctions,
wherby they render the Art of mastring Man to be
more difficult and distracted, then it is in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
But, under favour, the main cause that ther are
such difficulties and incertitudes in prescribing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Rules to govern the Human Creture, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances
of his mind, his variety of humors, his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
disposition, his inconstancies, and an itching
still after innovations; And herein we <hi>Irrationall</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
are more obedient, more gentle and docile;
But touching the policy you mention, ther be som
certain Maxims that may extend to the whole masse
of Mankind in point of Government; One is, That the
common peeple be kept still in such an awe, that they
may not have any power to rise up in Arms, or be
sharers in the Government, and so be their own Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
to chuse what Laws they please; Secondly,
That ther be a visible standing effectif military
strength still in being, to keep them in such an awe,
as well to <hi>curb</hi> them as to <hi>conserve</hi> them; It being the
greatest Soloecism that can be in Government to rely
meerly upon the affections of the <hi>Peeple,</hi> in regard
there is not such a wavering windy thing, not such an
humorsom crosse-grain'd Animal as the common Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ther is not such a Tyrant in the world if once he
get on Horse-back; And all Authors that have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
any thing to policy, either old or new, affirm
so much in their Writings; If the Governour in chief
hath not such a constant visible Power, and movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
upon all occasions, the common Peeple will use
him as the Froggs in the Fable us'd the Logg of wood
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98502:62"/>
whom <hi>Iupiter,</hi> at their importunity, had dropt down
among them for their King, to whom they stood a
while in som awe and dread, but afterwards finding
no motion in him, they leapt and skipt upon him in
contempt and derision; There is another certain prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of policy, That public Traitors and Rebells to
their Prince and Country shold be dispatched to the
other world without mercy, for if they be but half
punished, they will like Snakes get and cling together
again, therfore 'tis a good rule, and that may be a
proverb hereafter,
<q>
                     <l>A Rebell and mad Dogg knock in the head,</l>
                     <l>They will not bite when they are dead.</l>

               <p>Had you not told me before, yet I shold have judg'd
you a <hi>Saturnian</hi> by the wisdom of your Discours,
your Compatriots being accounted the prudentest

whereas the <hi>Artonian</hi> is said to be wiser than he seems
to be, the <hi>Tumontian</hi> not to be so wise as he seems,
the <hi>Saturnian</hi> is wise, and seems to be so; Therfore

               <p>Truly, Madame, I may say, according to the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proverb, that I have received a <hi>flapp with a Fox tail,</hi>
he hath plaid the cunning Sophister with me, he hath
protested against that Bill of <hi>Exchange,</hi> nor will he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any tearms resume his former shape, but retain
that which he hath, alledging that he is now free
from those stings of <hi>conscience,</hi> from those corroding
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98502:63"/>
black <hi>jealousies,</hi> from that <hi>vindicatif</hi> humor wherunto
Mankind is subject, specially those of his <hi>Nation,</hi>
with other molestations of mind; He saith, that in
this feature he is also more healthfull; He braggs
likewise how many medicinall vertues are in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
after its dissolution from the sensitive soul, and
how much his skin is valued amongst the fairest La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which he intends to bequeath as a Legacy to
your Majesty to make you Muffs of when he hath
payed Nature the last debt; And truly, Madame, by
his acute answers and replies, I found that he had the
full use of the faculty of <hi>human Reson,</hi> though appeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>I know full well, Madame, the ignorance, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
insulsity of the common peeple to be such, that
when they find any extraordinary effects produc'd,
transcending the ordinary course of nature, they are
presently struck with such an admiration, that they
think those effects to be done by the work of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
though they are operated by strength of Art, and
by connexion of naturall Agents and Patients proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply'd, as of late years ther is found out a <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patheticall</hi>
cure of wounds at a distance, without
any reall application of medicines to the part affected,
which kind of sanation they hold to be made by some

               <p>I pray be pleas'd to impart unto me the mode and
manner of that kind of cure, for though it be not

                  <hi>Magicall,</hi> it must needs be a great mysterious thing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>Madame, I shall most willingly comply with your
commands herein; Touching the Sympatheticall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or Medicine it self, It is made of a Zaphyrian
azurd salt, calcind by <hi>Solar</hi> fire into a <hi>Lunar</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
operating principally when the Sun is in the
two celestiall Signes of <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Cancer;</hi> But, Madame,
before I can make the thing truly understood, I must
lay down som universall Laws or Maxims of nature;
First, it is tru without controul, that all actions and
motions are performed by Atoms or small invisible
bodies, moving to and fro after a different manner
proportionable to their severall figures, all naturall
things operat thus, and not by I know not what
Qualities or Accidents, which have onely a notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
subsistence, and no reall being but as they inhaere
in the substance; Secondly, ther is a perpetuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
expiration of such <hi>Atoms</hi> from all naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
caus'd by a compression of other circumambient
and neighbouring bodies, driving the parts closer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or else by the motion of other <hi>Atoms</hi> crowding
into the foraminous parts of that body, interrupting
as it were the quietude of the former inmates, and
thrusting them out to wander in the air till they meet
with som other body where they may get rest; This
effluvium or emanation of <hi>Atoms</hi> by help of autopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Glasses, have bin sensibly discerned to flow from
the Load-stone and other bodies, whose pores are
more plentifull, in form of a kind of mist; In bodies
that are actually hot this atomicall expiration is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
perceptible by the smell, specially to cretures of
an acuter sense, for the Atoms hovering in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumambient
air, or upon the ground, are sure guides to
the Grey-hound while he poursues the Chace, as if
the hunted creture were continually in his sight;
These expiring Atoms are also as sensibly discover'd
by weight, it being experimentally found, that those
<hi>Iockies</hi> who use to run Horse-races can make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs
lighter by many pounds weight in a day or two,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98502:64"/>
which proceeds by this insensible emission of Atoms;
Secondly, it is to be observ'd, that these atomicall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are not of one figure, nor of one grossnesse or
magnitude, som being so slender and subtle that they
admit of no opposition, but continu their course
through all Mediums, and whatever may be seen to
stop them in their journey cannot be discerned but
by their effects, such are the contagious Atoms of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
infected with the Pest, or other taking-diseases,
which are not onely imparted to others by lurking
in the Visitant's cloths, but being scattered in the air
are transported to remote places and persons, on
whom they exercise their tyranny, not discover'd till
they break out into open violence; Other Atoms are
grosser, and cannot so easily passe by, but are driven
back, and forced from their intended voyage, and
somtimes driven into the pory parts of other bodies
against their wills; Such Atoms are apprehended by
our senses, as heat, cold, color, smells, putrefactions,
&amp;c. which use to move more slowly than others;
Som are so corpulent and strong that they remove
fix'd and solid bodies out of their stations, as the <hi>Wind,</hi>
and many others, that are driven to and fro by the
impetuosity therof, and forced therby to change their
places; These Atoms are in a manner so palpable,
that we must needs confesse their reall Beeing and
activity; Thirdly, it is another undeniable truth, that
all bodies desire rest, and wold still dwell in their own
proper stations if they were not ejected by an intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for <hi>Rest</hi> is the appetite of all naturall bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis the mother of union; Now, ther are som
places more fit than others for the receiving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of the said Atoms, wherin they may lodg
more conveniently, and acquiesce a longer time, this
proceeds from the fashion and form of the pores
wherin they are intromitted, which are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and more agreeing with the figures of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
which are of divers shapes, for som are angular,
som cylindricall, som are branch'd, som smooth,
others are sharp and rough; Ther are in most bodies
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98502:64"/>
pores agreeable to these various figures, insomuch
that every naturall body is apt and ready to admit
such Atoms that are cognate and proportionable to
their pores, and to exclude others; Now no Atoms
acquiesce any where but in such proportionat pores,
they may be driven into other bodies, or they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
other Atoms into pores that do not exactly
quadrat with their figures, but cannot take any long
repose there, being still extruded by those that do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fill the place, and correspond with the capacity
and proportion of those pores, whence ariseth a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
propension and tendency towards those bodies
where such pores are found; Nor can those Atoms
which are not sutable to the pores wherein they are,
stay there quietly, but they are still dislodg'd and shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
out, or pressed to give room to those Atoms
whose figures challenge a right to those pores; Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that it may be said, ther is a kind of perpetuall
warr 'twixt those Atoms that are proportionat and
proper to the pores they are lodg'd in, and those which
usurp them; For to have perfect rest in a place, and
to claim a naturall right unto it, ther must be a cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
'twixt the atom and the pore which may be
call'd <hi>Sympathy,</hi> such as are all magneticall and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
motions; Fourthly, no distance hinders the
motion of these Atoms towards their naturall cognate
places, towards which they are perpetually travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and the nearer they approach to their desired
home, the swifter their motion is, and the lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
they find in their journey.</p>
               <p>These prolegomena or generall notions being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
I com now to the operative vertue of the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patheticall
Powder,</hi> which, as I describ'd it before, is
made of a Zaphyrian salt, calcind by a celestiall fire,
operating in <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Cancer</hi> into a <hi>Lunar</hi> complexion (as
the learned Doctor <hi>H.</hi> hath it, who discourseth like a
tru Phoilosopher of these notions) The heat here of must
be such, that it may draw out all adventitious moystur,
leaving it intensly dry, and in this condition it must be
kept, for if it chance to meet with any humidity it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98502:65"/>
loseth its energy, and must to the aetnereall furnace
again; It must be also but a competent heat, for by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of heat all the volatile parts and finest atoms
which onely work the cure, will be evaporated, and
onely the grosser saline parts remain, which neither
can be rays'd to accompany the atoms of the extrave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
blood, nor if they could wold they cure, but by
their sharper angles grate the orifices of the capilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
veins, and so procure an efflux of blood, and not a
consolidation of the wound.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Morphandra.</speaker>
               <p>Noble Prince, these are high Philosophicall Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that you discourse of, but now that you have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the substance of this rare Medicament, how
must it be apply'd?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>The manner of applying it is in this manner, The
blood or bloody matter being taken from the wound
on a cloth, or remaining still on the wounding instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
must be lightly covered over with this powder,
kept very dry, and afterwards wrapp'd up close from
the air, and so preserved in a temperat heat, it must
also be kept clean, and clos'd up with neat linnen
to fence it from cold, for cold hinders the expiration
and breathing forth of the balsamicall Atoms, which
shold drain forth the superfluous humidity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the efflux of blood; Now, the greatest rarenes
of this <hi>Sympatheticall Powder</hi> is, that by a <hi>virtuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact</hi>
it heals at a distance by the intercourse of the
Atoms proceeding from the extravenated blood of the
Patient, which Atoms like so many little spirits glide
through the aire, and never rest till they come to their
desired home, where being gladly entertained, they
find an easie entrance at the cognate parts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionat
pores of the wound; Being admitted there
they fall to work, and first, they dilate the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
humid parts, and make them fit to be expell'd,
then by their more then ordinary restrictive power
they shrinck together the pores, and squeezing out
that noxious corrupt humidity, glew together the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98502:65"/>
parts, and so cicatrize and cure: And truly,
Madame, I could produce diverse pregnant examples
of those that were healed by the atomicall energy of
this Sympatheticall powder, but I desire one may
serve for all; Ther was a knowing Captain who made
often use of it, and two of his Officers having drawn
blood one of another in a Duell, he got their bloodied
Swords and applied his balsamicall Powder, so in lesse
then 24 hours they were almost cur'd; But the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
understanding that their animosities were such,
that they were resolved to fight again, he hung the
balsam'd bloodied Swords out at his window all
night, so comming the next morning to visit his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
they told him that they were in cruell pain
all night long; And so you shall be still, quoth the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
untill you be perfect friends, for I hear that
you will fight again; So having made them shake
hands, and perfectly reconcil'd them, he cur'd both
in a very short time.</p>

               <speaker>Morphandra.</speaker>
               <p>I acknowledge it a singular favour, most gallant
Prince, that you have made me understand this great
Secret, and the naturall causes thereof, though the
common peeple, who use to condemn all they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not, and whereunto their short capacities can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reach, for <hi>Magicall.</hi> But, if you persist in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to convert any of these metamorphos'd Animals,
and proceed further in your attempts, I spy amongst
those Trees a <hi>Boar</hi> who was once an <hi>Aetonian</hi> Count,
whom for his deboshments and intemperancies I
transmuted to that shape; you may try what you can
do upon him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>I will, by the continuance of your noble favor,
make towards him; Miserable metamorphos'd Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!
how much do I resent the condition you are
now in in comparison of the former! for I understand
by Queen <hi>Morphandra</hi> that you were before not onely
a Man, but a personage of high account in <hi>Aetonia,</hi>
that masculine and generous brave Country, which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98502:66"/>
is so full of large flourishing Provinces, of opulent
fair Cities and famous <hi>Marts,</hi> so full of magnificent
Palaces, of Mines of Tresure, of fruitfull Orchards,
of fragrant Gardens and fat Fields, of navigable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
so full of illustrious Families that can extract
their pedigrees thousands of years past; so ful of great
Princes, wherwith <hi>Aetonia</hi> may be said to shine as the
Firmament with coruscant Starrs, and the Septemvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
of Caesarean Electors are as the seven Planets;
Are you contented to return to so gallant a Country,
to resume the figure of that noble personage you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
when you were Man, and live again under
<hi>Caesar</hi> the Prince paramount of all others? If you have
a disposition to it, Queen <hi>Morphandra</hi> hath promised
me to transmute you, and I have an accommodation
for your transport; Therfore will you shake off that
wild savage shape, and becom Man again?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Boar.</speaker>
               <p>Savage! Truly, Sir, I think <hi>Man</hi> is far more savage
and cruell, for the wildest of our Species will not
strike at <hi>Man</hi> till <hi>Man</hi> hath begun first with him, and
wounded him, and all <hi>Huntsmen</hi> will tell you so; But
I could produce many horrid examples of the cruelty
and tru culency of <hi>Man,</hi> and of my quondam Conter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneans
in particular, but let this serve for all; It
chanced ther was one that bore malice to a woman
great with child, he watching his opportunity found
her alone spinning in her house, he first cuts her
throat, then ripps up her womb, takes out the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo
and carries it to the back-side where ther was a
Sow ready to Farrow, he kills also the Sow, rips up
her belly, and taking out the pigs, puts the child of
the murther'd woman in their room, then he took
the piggs and puts them in the womans belly, and so
sow'd it up, <hi>proh scelus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the high Encomiums you give of <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
'tis tru, that she was in former times a gallant
piece of the Continent, but now she is pittifully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
and degenerated from what she was; Ther was
a <hi>Count</hi> there who prov'd most unfortunat, both to his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98502:66"/>
own Country and to himself, who aiming at a
Crown made warr against <hi>Caesar,</hi> to whom he ow'd
allegiance; And to abett his cause he brought in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
Princes for his Confederats, and so kindled a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
lingring Warr in the bowells of his own
Country, which for thirty years together did so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasse
her, that to this day she is scarce come to her self;
Among others, he introduc'd a hungry Northern
King who did her a world of mischief, whose Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
keeps firm footing there still, and whiles the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prinian</hi>
hath an acre of land in <hi>Aetonia,</hi> she will never
be in a durable secure peace; Touching the multitude
of illustrious Families that are in <hi>Aetonia,</hi> most of
them may be said to be but <hi>mongrell</hi> Princes, for in the
forenoon they are <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> (having rais'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs
out of the ruines of the Church) and in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
they are <hi>Laicks</hi> and <hi>Seculars;</hi> Now, those va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Princes are rather a weaknesse then a strength
to <hi>Aetonia,</hi> as may be inferred out of that witty Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
which the <hi>Tomanto</hi> Emperor's Embassadors
made, being present at the election of one of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonian
Caesars,</hi> who observing what great Princes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
him that day, wherof he was told that som
of them could raise an Army of themselfs if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd;
The Ambassadour smilingly said, That he
doubted not of the puissance of <hi>Aetonia,</hi> but it might
be said, that the Minds, Counsells, and Actions of the
<hi>Aetonians</hi> were like a great Beast with many Heads
and Tails, who being in case of necessity to passe
through a hedge, and every Head seeking to find a
severall hole to get thorough, they were a hinderance
one to the other, every Head drawing after his own
fancy, and so hazarded the destruction of all the Heads
and Tails; But the <hi>Tomanto</hi> Empire was like a Beast
that had multitude of Tails, but one Head that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
all the Body, which Head being to get through
any passage, all the Tayls follow him in an exact obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
without any confusion of diffring fancies or
clashing of opinions.</p>
               <p>Touching that <hi>Caesar</hi> you speak of, whom you wold
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98502:67"/>
make Prince Paramount of all others in point of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and Might, it cannot be denied but that the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
Eagle,</hi> when he was at the highest pitch of
power, might be said to have spread his Wings overall
the then habitable Earth, he fixed his Talons upon the
banks of <hi>Euphrates</hi> Eastward, upon the <hi>Nile</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and he had all the known <hi>Western</hi> world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his pounces; His annuall Revenues were then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
at a hundred and fifty Millions, wherof the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
of the Legionary Soldiers amounted to twenty
Millions; But that glorious Empire, that mighty
Giantesse, is now shrunck up and shrivell'd into a
Pigmey's skin, insomuch that the present <hi>Caesar</hi> may
be said to have onely one of the old Eagle's feathers
in his cap: He who was us'd to make the greatest Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentats
pay homage unto him, is now us'd to be baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
by every petty Companion.</p>

               <p>Such is the plesure of the All-ruling <hi>Providence,</hi>
with whom the greatest Kingdoms upon Earth are
but as so many kettle-pins, which he tips down when
he pleases, 'tis He who transvolves Empires, tumbles
down Monarchies, and cantonizeth them into petty
Common-wealths, whereunto the Philosopher seem'd
to allude, when being ask'd what <hi>Iupiter</hi> did in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
he answer'd, <hi>Magnas Ollas frangit, &amp; ex frustis earum
parvulas componit,</hi> He breaks great Pots, and of their
fragments makes little pitchers; This shews the brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes,
the lubricity, and unfixednes of all sublunary
things, as well Politicall as Naturall, so that to find
out a tru stability and permanence, we must travell
beyond <hi>Trismegistus</hi>'s Circle, and seek it in the other
world: But let not this alienat your affections to visit
again your own Country in human shape, and return
to your Religion, wherby when this mortall life is
ended you may gain Eternity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Religion</hi> I truly ther's scarce any left in <hi>Aetonia,</hi> for
since the time of <hi>Therlu,</hi> who being fallen into a lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
love with an Abadesse, unfrock'd himself, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98502:67"/>
made Religion his Macarell to enjoy her; I say, since
that time, the <hi>Artonian</hi> fancy was never so greedy
after new fashions in <hi>Apparell,</hi> as the <hi>Aetonians high
and low</hi> do daily thirst after <hi>new-fangled opinions</hi> in
matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> both in point of Doctrine and
Discipline.</p>
               <p>Add hereunto, that ther is a bosom peculiar vice
<hi>Aetonia</hi> is addicted unto, which is <hi>Intemperance,</hi>
wherwith she hath infected most of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
The <hi>Hydraulian</hi> can tell you, that the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat
use of drink came tumbling down upon her
from <hi>Aetonia</hi> like a huge, and a furious rapid Torrent,
whence it found passage over with wind in poop to
<hi>Gheriona</hi> (and her subordinat Kingdoms) which is as
good at it being of an <hi>Aetonian</hi> race originally, and
therfore apt to imitat; Nay, as they say, as the <hi>Ghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionian</hi>
is good <hi>Inventis addere,</hi> to improve any new
thing, so they go beyond the <hi>Aetonians</hi> herein, for
whereas <hi>they</hi> use to pelt the brain with small shot, the
<hi>Gherionian</hi> doth storm it with great Cannons, and
huge carowses, for he, when he is at it, doth not sip
and drink by halfs, or demur upon it by pauses, as the

but he deals in sheer liquor, and is quickly at

Yet the <hi>Aetonian</hi> carrieth still the report to a Proverb:
Hereupon they use to characterise the <hi>Aetonian</hi> to be
an Animal that can drink more then he can carry, and
who useth to barrell up more than he can broach in

have in him more than he can utter.</p>

               <p>It is a great truth, and when we are dead ther's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that's bad in us but our Excrements, which also
though, in regard of the sharpnes therof, they be not
good for compost to fertilize the Earth, yet they are
found good for divers sorts of Trees, as the <hi>Pomgranat</hi>
and the <hi>Almond</hi> Trees, as also for divers sorts of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
Trees to free them from worms: Our blood being
so full of fibres is excellent good against Carbuncles,
our brains are good against the biting of Serpents; our
lard with wonderfull celerity makes firm broken
bones; the ashes of our cheek-bone are good against
Ulcers; the liver of a Boar is good against the biting
of a mad Dogg, and drowsines of spirit; the gall of a
Boar mingled with rosin and hony, is passing good
against Ulcers, the Testicles good against the Falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicknes;
the hoofs of a boar made powder is good
against the stopping of the urine; a plaister made of
Boar's dung is good against all venomous bitings, as
also against the pain in the spleen, or the <hi>Sciatica;</hi> the
ankle of a boar worn about the neck is good against
quartan Agues: Moreover 'tis found tru by frequent
experiments, that the milk of a Sow in sweet wine is
good to help women in travell, and restores milk in
their paps, 'tis good also against the bloody flix, and
the tissick; Amber sodd in Boar's grease receives nitor,
and bewty: Now, all these vertues proceed from our
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98502:68"/>
Bodies, because we have not so much corruption
within us as Man; Our food also being more simple
and fresh, and our appetites more regular; So, Sir, I
bid you farewell, for I am going to <hi>herb</hi> it among that
tuft of Trees.</p>

my Camerades did a world of mischief to the poor

               <p>Yet you know, that the profession of Arms is noble,
for every Soldier is a Gentleman by his profession;
And touching the coldness of your Clime, it puts
mettle and the more vigor in the Combatant, for they
say that a <hi>Cuprinian</hi> fights best when he sees his own
breath, which is in frosty weather; You know also
what great atchievments and exploits your two last

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wolf.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis tru, the last two Kings have done some feats of
Chivalry, yet the world took them to be but Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
Touching the first, he was killd in the midst of
his manhood, wherby <hi>Caesar</hi> against whom he warr'd
got a full revenge of him; And for the present King,
the world wonders that it was not sufficient for him
to enjoy quietly the Kingdom of <hi>Cuprinia,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
by right to <hi>Nopolia,</hi> but he must make warr
against <hi>that King,</hi> to whom he shold <hi>de jure</hi> owe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance;
And had he conquer'd <hi>Nopolia,</hi> his ambition
had not terminated there, but he haply had visited
<hi>Saturnia,</hi> and so, as the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls</hi> of old, he
had troubled the repose of all the Western world;
But as far as he hath gone, what miserable devasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98502:69"/>
hath he made? how hath he ruined the flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Trade of those Countrys, which are so full of
great Mercantile Towns both upon fresh and salt
waters, so full of usefull and necessary commodities?
And had he compleated his <hi>Zundanian</hi> designe, he had
given Law to all the Occidentall Princes, which <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draulia</hi>
sagaciously smelt out, and so timely prevented
him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>And have not you a naturall desire rather to be

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wolf.</speaker>
               <p>Truly I may be said to be of as rapacious a nature
when I was a <hi>Cuprinian,</hi> for he is us'd to pick any
quarrell with those that are weaker than himself, of
purpose to devour them; As I remember to have read
of the <hi>Wolf</hi> in the Fable, who finding a young Lamb,
and intending to devour him, fell a coining of reasons
why he would do it, and so told him, that he and his
generation had don him wrong from time to time:
Helas, said the <hi>Lamb,</hi> how could that be? for I am but
newly com into the world; I but, quoth the <hi>Wolf,</hi> you
eat up my grasse; The <hi>Lamb</hi> replyed, How can that
be, Sir? for I have yet no teeth in my head; I but you
drink up my water, quoth the <hi>Wolf</hi> again; That can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be neither, Sir, said the <hi>Lamb,</hi> for I never knew
what water is hitherto, in regard I feed altogether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my mothers milk; 'Tis not your reasons, replied the
<hi>Wolf</hi> again, can confute my appetit, for I mean to sup
plentifully this night, and so devour'd him. But the
same fate may attend the <hi>Cuprinian</hi> King as befell the
<hi>Wolf-fish,</hi> who living in a River where all the fish were
lesser then himself, they all admir'd, honor'd, and
fear'd him, as if he had bin their King; He thinking to
enlarge his Dominions, thought to go to the Sea to be
King there, but meeting with the <hi>Dolphin</hi> in his way
he was presently devour'd; Or as <hi>Aesop</hi>'s <hi>Dogg,</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by a River with a good piece of flesh in his mouth,
and the shadow of the flesh appeering in the water,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98502:70"/>
he snapt at it thinking it had been real flesh, and so
lost that which he had in his mouth; So the <hi>Cuprinian</hi>
King may hap to lose his own Territories, while he
thinks to devour others.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well, will you shake off that ugly shape, and
put on <hi>Man</hi> again, and go along with me towards your
own Country?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wolf.</speaker>
               <p>Truly no, for I have tryed <hi>both</hi> natures, and find
this to be far better, for I have now no airy aspiring
desires in me, no ambitious thoughts, or other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances
and inquietudes of mind; Moreover, I find
this shape of body to be far more healthfull, nor is this
species lesse honourable; A <hi>Wolf</hi> was the Crest of the
first Arms of <hi>Rome,</hi> in regard the King who trac'd the
foundation of that glorious City, and denominated
her after his own name, was nurs'd up miraculously
by a <hi>Wolf;</hi> Ther have bin many famous men of that
name, as <hi>Lupus Fulvius</hi> a Roman Poet, <hi>Lupus Servatus</hi>
a memorable Priest, and <hi>Lupus de Oliveto</hi> a Saint-like
Monk; Ther is a kind of Holines also in this species, for
they never engender but in the twelve days of <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas;</hi>
Ther is likewise a mysterious quality in this spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
for if a <hi>Wolf</hi> sees a man first, the man grows hoarse;
If the tail of a <hi>Wolf</hi> be hung in the Cratch of Oxen, they
cannot eat; If a Horse treads in the foot-steps of a
<hi>Wolf,</hi> he cleaves fast as if he were frozen; Nay, if a
Mare big with Foal tread in the place where a <hi>Wolf</hi> had
trodden, it causeth abortion, and will make her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to cast her Foal; Lastly, strings made of <hi>VVolfs</hi>
guts have that predominance in Music, that if they be
put among other strings, ther wil never be any Consort.</p>

he bitterly inveighs against; and against the humor
of the peeple, as also against his former profession of
a Souldier, tacitly intimating, that War is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
seminary of Theeves, according to the proverb,
<hi>La guerre fait les larrons, &amp; la paix les ameine au gibet,</hi>
War makes the Thief, and peace brings him to the

peaceably under your Government, than to be in <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prinia,</hi>
where of late years men are so press'd for the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Goat.</speaker>
               <p>What do you mean by Reson? I think the shape
and species I now am in are capable of <hi>Reson,</hi> for we
can distinguish 'twixt good and bad, 'twixt what is
noxious or profitable for us, we have also the same
organs, the same cells and receptacles in the brain as

pour the same influences upon us as they use to do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>It cannot be denied but you have an <hi>Instinct</hi>

Reson;</hi> But the Reson that Beasts have is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
to corporeall objects, to the necessities onely of
life, to find out food and shelter, and bring up their

of <hi>Singulars,</hi> its restrain'd to an opinionative faculty,
its a meer shadow of ours, much like the objects that
our fancy represents to us in sleep; And this Instinct
in Beasts is as much inferiour to Reson in Man, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

               <p>Yet, Sir, it must be granted, that actions whose suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
are so well ordered, actions which have so well
regulated a progresse, and concatenation so exactly
tying the Mediums to the End, must needs be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the guidance and light of tru Reson, and
such actions you know sensitive cretures daily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;
With what art do Birds build their nests, the
Fox his hole, the Badger his chamber, with what cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
do they preserve their young ones, and fence
them from the injury of the Hevens? how punctually
do they keep their haunts? But what do you think of
<hi>Pliny</hi>'s Elephant repeating his Lesson at Moon-shine,
or of <hi>Ptolomey</hi>'s Stagg that understood Greek, of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>'s
Dogg who could counterfeit the very convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of death, of the Ape that could play at Chesse,
and another that had learnt som touches on the Guit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern?
What think you of <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Horse who was
made Consul? had not he Reson in him? What think
you of the Asse, who being us'd to carry burdens of
Salt over a Foord was us'd to stumble and fall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
in such a place, that therby the salt melting
away into water his burden might be the lighter, but
his Master lading him with a tadd of Wool, he
fell at his usuall place, but being helped up again,
and he feeling the pack of wool heavier in regard of
the water that got in, he never stumbled any more in
the Foord after that time; What think you of the
Crow, that in the time of a great drowth finding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the bottom of a barrell, and being fearfull to
go down, carried so many stones in her beak, that
letting them fall down, they forc'd the water to rise
upwards towards the top, and so she dranck safely
and at ease? I pray were not all these not onely Instin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
but <hi>Discoursive</hi> Resons?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>I confesse that he who denies a kind of <hi>Reson</hi> and
Resoning also to brute Animals, may be questiond
whether he be master of Reson himself, yet this <hi>Reson</hi>
and Resoning looks upon present and particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98502:72"/>
onely; But human Reson extendeth to universall
notions out of the reach of sense, which cannot be
without abstractions, and som reflections it hath on
it self, which Beasts cannot attain; This Reson that is
conversant with Universalls is the tru specificall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
'twixt Man and Beasts; It is the portion and
property of Man alone, whereby he hath the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainty
over all over his fellow-cretures throughout
all the Elementary World; Ther is <hi>Intuitive,</hi> ther is
<hi>Discoursive,</hi> and ther is <hi>Instinctive</hi> Reson, the first is
proper to <hi>Angels,</hi> the last to <hi>Brute</hi> Animals, and the
second to <hi>Man,</hi> who can contemplat and discourse of
generalls and things absent; And these three differ in
excellency as the three degrees of Comparison.</p>

               <p>Yet though you excell us as you say in this kind of
<hi>Reson,</hi> thers many of us that surpasse you in strength
and quicknesse of sense, as the <hi>Eagle</hi> in seeing, for he
can look upon the Sun in the Meridian with full open
eyes, and not be dazzled; the <hi>Hare</hi> can hear better,
and the <hi>Dogg</hi> goes far beyond you in smelling, as also
the <hi>Stagg,</hi> therefore when he is removed from one

him in close Carts that he may not smell the way
back again; And there be examples to admiration of
this kind.</p>

               <p>Though som Beasts smelling be beyond ours in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

Erection (after the beholding of Heven) is the exercise
Arts, which cannot be done in another figure; Mans

though born naked, yet this nakednesse cuts out work

benefit unto him, and given as a recompence for his
frailties, nakedness and weakness, yet in som kind it
it may be said to be a disadvantage unto him, for it
makes him subject to a thousand vexations of spirit,
it fills him with inquisitive thoughts and scruples
touching his salvation, it makes him a tyrant to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by sundry sorts of perplexities and molestations
of mind, for I have known it by experience, let the
threed of a man's life be never so well spun, yet
it cannot be without bracks and thrumbs: Ther is
no creture so troublesome to himself as man, for as
rust adheres naturally to Copper, so ill affections and
obliquities adhere to human nature: Moreover, <hi>you,</hi>
like us, are but raggs of mortality, yet you are so vain
in magnifying your own species, that you make Man
the epitome and complement of all created natures;

               <p>It may well be said to be so, for of late years ther
were cull'd out within three miles compasse ten men
that were a thousand years between them, one sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
what the other wanted of a hundred years
apiece, and they danc'd the <hi>Morris</hi> divers hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Market-place, with a Taborer before them
103 years old, and a Maid <hi>Mariam</hi> 105. But <hi>Orosia</hi> is
much degenerated from what she was by the <hi>Gherio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Sectaries, who have infected the Inhabitants with
so many pseudodoxall and gingling opinions, which is
the recompence she receives from <hi>Gheriona</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
her first from an <hi>Infidell</hi> to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> yet
she hath the impudence lately as to call her <hi>Heathenish;</hi>
Moreover, she twits her ever and anon with <hi>Leeks</hi>
and <hi>Cheese,</hi> though both tend, the one to the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Nation, the other of the Country; For
wheras the <hi>Orosian</hi> doth use to wear the first in his
hat constantly upon such a day, it is to a commemorat
the time that a famous Battle was fought, wherein
other Nations that werein the Army ran away, but
the <hi>Orosians</hi> stood to their ground, and got the day;
Now, to signalize and distinguish themselfs from the
Fugitifs, they took <hi>Leeks</hi> in their caps which grew in
a Garden hard by; Besides, 'tis known how one of the
acutest Nations on earth ador'd the <hi>Leek</hi> as one of his
gods: Touching the other, to have <hi>Cheese</hi> enough is the
mark of a fruitfull Country, and good pasture; This
makes me tell you a facetious Epigram,

Organ also in the throat: Our hair burnt driveth away
Serpents, and cureth decayed genitalls; The marrow
of a Goat is singular good against Aches; The gall mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Jaundise, and to stay Female-fluxes, as also gargariz'd
good against old coughs; The fatt sodden with
Goats dung is good if applied to the Gout; The but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the fatt of a male Goat is good for an old sore
for Kibes, the Kings-Evill, and Fellons, or mixed with

one of his resons is, that the <hi>Gherionian</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining

Morall and Metaphysicall, why he wold not turn
Man again, alledging at last that the shape he now
wears is farr more sound and healthfull, abounding
more with naturall heat, which makes his body, and

               <p>I told you partly before, but I will enlarge my self
further, and deduce matter from their first rise; <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boncia</hi>
and <hi>Gheriona</hi> were in a sweet and sound peace,
with affluences of all felicities, when som <hi>Carboncian</hi>
Soldiers of Fortune return'd from the <hi>Cuprinian</hi>
Warrs richly laden with spoils, they came strutting
into the <hi>Gherionian</hi> Court, the <hi>Aetonian</hi> plunder shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon their backs in gold and silver lace; These
military Commanders expecting to receive som ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
from the <hi>Gherionian</hi> King for their services in
<hi>Aetonia,</hi> though none of them had received any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from him, nor fought on his score; Others
looking for som office at Court, and missing their
aim that way, som of them went to <hi>Carboncia</hi> discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
and fearing the stock they had got in the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prinian</hi>
Warr wold quickly consume, and having no
other trade but <hi>fighting,</hi> they fell to devise a way
how to cast a bone 'twixt <hi>Gheriona</hi> and <hi>Carboncia,</hi> that
they might have employment; Therfore they set on
som prick-ear'd hot-pated Preachmen (who were in
a kind of subjection unto them for their Stipends) to
give out, That <hi>Gheriona</hi> was on her way to <hi>Antichrist</hi>
again; thus the Pulpits did ring of invectives and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
against <hi>Gheriona</hi>'s Church-Government; Yet
all this while there was not matter enough for an
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98502:75"/>
actuall Insurrection, or to fire the Beacons, till by
wily artifices of som of the said discontented Great
ones <hi>Gheriona's Liturgy</hi> was sent among them to be put
in practise; This was cryed up to be the gretest Idoll
that ever came to their <hi>Kirk,</hi> and so the common
peeple in a furious unheard-of manner outrag'd those
who read it; The King having notice hereof, sent a
gracious Declaration, That wheras he had onely <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended</hi>
unto them, not <hi>commanded</hi> that public form of
divine Worship, wherin he himself did punctually
and publickly twice a day perform his duty to Heven,
he did it out of a pious intention to beget an Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
as well as an Unanimity of public Devotion in
all his Dominions, and as it was already practis'd in
<hi>Gheriona</hi> and <hi>Hebrinia,</hi> so he desir'd it shold be us'd
also in <hi>That</hi> his Native Country; But since he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
it produc'd such tumultuous consequences, he
was contented absolutely to revoke it, for it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his intent to presse the practise therof upon any
conscience, &amp;c. Therfore he requir'd that every one
shold return to his former obedience, offring an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestia</hi>
for what had pass'd; But this wold not serve
the turn, for ther was a further designe in it, which
was to destroy the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and so make havock of
the Patrimony of the Church; Hereupon the whole
Country put it self in Arms, and so those Soldiers of
Fortune spoken of before brought their work about,
and got employment; <hi>For Soldiers in time of Peace are
like Chimneys in Summer;</hi> They thought to rush into
<hi>Gheriona</hi> with an Army, yet they gave it out to the
world they came as Petitioners; So the <hi>Carboncian</hi>
shewed Subjects the way to present Petitions to their
Souverain upon the Pikes point, to bring a <hi>Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in one hand, and a <hi>Sword</hi> in the other, or as one said,
the <hi>Bible</hi> in the left, and the <hi>Blade</hi> in the other

            <sp>

               <p>This was an odious Rebellion in the highest degree,
for Subjects to right themselfs by Arms, and wage
Warr with their own Souvrain Prince; It is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98502:76"/>
that when God pleased to punish any of the
Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> he did not do it with the <hi>Iews</hi> their
own Subjects, but with the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and other <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
Nations, whence it may be strongly inferr'd,
that it was never allow'd by the Laws of God or Man,
that Subjects shold rise up in Arms against their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
King.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Goose.</speaker>
               <p>Yet the <hi>Carboncian</hi> rush'd thrice into <hi>Gheriona</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their own native King (having therby a greter
share in him) in the compasse of lesse then two years,
and he was dismissed Fidler-like, with meat, drink,
and mony; Though in former times <hi>Gheriona</hi> was us'd
to dismis the <hi>Carboncians</hi> (whensoever they infested
her borders) with other kind of metalls, <hi>viz.</hi> with
good <hi>steel</hi> and <hi>iron</hi> in lieu of <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>silver.</hi>

               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>These were strange and uncouth hateful traverses,
that a Nation shold prove so perfidious to their own
Prince, a Prince born in the bowells of their own
Country, whose Father, besides Himself, had obliged
and laden them with so many signall and singular
favors; Therefore ther was here a complication of
many ugly things, ther was <hi>Rebellion,</hi> ther was <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,</hi>

               <speaker>Goose.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I will tell you more, when their said King
had made a long tedious journy of 600 miles going
and comming to visit them, he was so gracious, that
they did but ask and have any thing; He gave amongst
them those antient Demeans that went to maintain
the <hi>Mitre</hi> so many hundred years by the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
donation of Progenitors; He conferr'd honors
abundantly upon them of all kinds, and did other
wondrous acts of grace, for which the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill
in <hi>Gheriona</hi> use to give a supply of Tresure to their
Souvrain by way of an humble correspondence, but
he did all this to the <hi>Carboncian gratis;</hi> Yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
afterwards the gretest monsters of ingratitude
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98502:76"/>
that ever were, for they not onely sided with his <hi>Ghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionian</hi>
Insurrectors against him, but when by crosse
successes and corrupt counsells he was brought to
such an exigent, that he went away in a mean disguise
to the <hi>Carboncian</hi> Army, they most basely for a sum of
mony delivered him over to the plesure of his <hi>Gheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onian</hi>
enemies, who tormented him afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
expression by hurrying him from prison to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and chopp'd off his head at last.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>One wold have thought, that the <hi>Carboncians</hi> wold
have valu'd it for a mighty honor, to have their own
King in the heighth of his distreses to throw himself
thus into their arms, and to put so rare a confidence
in them; But who were the chiefest instruments in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Goose.</speaker>
               <p>The unlucky <hi>Kirk-men,</hi> who as if they had bin so
many of the <hi>Devills Chaplains,</hi> preach'd nothing but
Warr, and against the receiving of the King in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boncia</hi>
in this his extremity; But ther were never so
many quick and apparant judgments fell upon any
Nation as have tumbled one upon the neck of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

outragious Plague in their chief City, which in one
yeers compasse swep'd away the Inhabitants by

over to furnish forrain Plantations? What nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of them were starv'd, and som tumbled into their

               <p>I will yet go further, this Rebellion in <hi>Carboncia</hi>
caus'd another in <hi>Hebrinia</hi> her neighbour, as one fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand
doth use to kindle another; <hi>Examples move,</hi>
and make strong impressions upon the fancy, <hi>Precepts</hi>
are not so powerfull as <hi>Precedents</hi> to work upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nature; The said example of the <hi>Carboncians</hi> did
wonderfully operat upon the imagination of the
<hi>Hebrinians,</hi> and fill'd them with thoughts of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they merited to have as good usage as the
<hi>Carboncian,</hi> their Country being far more beneficiall,
and consequently more importing the <hi>Gherionians,</hi>
wherof many thousands had made firm and plentifull
fortunes in her; Add hereunto, that the <hi>Hebrinians</hi>
had far more grievances than the <hi>Carboncians</hi> (who
really had none at all) for they were threatned to be
more pinch'd in the exercise of their Religion; There
was new Plantations intended to be made ther of
<hi>Carboncians</hi> and <hi>Hydraulians;</hi> There was every day a
scrutiny made of conceal'd Lands and dark defective
Titles; There were new Imposts laid upon them;
they remain'd incapable of any preferments in
Church and State, whereas the <hi>Carboncians</hi> had Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements
and Offices every day in the <hi>Gherionian</hi>
Court, and som of them admitted to sit at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Table;
These motifs impell'd the <hi>Hebrinians</hi> also
to rise up in Arms, hoping they might speed as well
as the <hi>Carboncian,</hi> who obtain'd what he pleas'd; So
they rise up to som purpose, for many cruentous and
horrid Massacres hapned on both sides, which took
away hundreds of thousands; Now, all these things
considered, will you have me return among the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boncians</hi>

               <p>'Tis tru, that <hi>Gheriona</hi> abounds with all things that

that all things are good in her <hi>except one, which

that her King hath bin call'd <hi>the King of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills;</hi>
If this hath bin said of her now, in former times, much
more may it be said of her now, most of the Nation
being so much deprav'd and degenerated from what
they were; Therfore if I were man again I wold be

               <p>Truly; Madame, I may say, that all this while ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the old proverb, I have bin <hi>shooing of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi>
I have spent my labor and breath to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in order to my main designe, yet I cannot deny
but that I have gain'd a great deal of rare knowledg
by communicating with these transmuted Animals,
and truly they have made me better acquainted with
my self, and with the state of Mankind in generall;
But for this last transform'd thing, none of all the rest
did brand his own Country-men so bitterly: He lays
to their charge originally all those fearfull calamities,
those horrid confusions, those cataracts of blood
which fell of late years both in <hi>Hebrinia</hi> and <hi>Gheriona;</hi>
And he said, that all that they have purchased ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
is, to have foold themselves into a perfect slavery,
and to have brought themselfs under an <hi>Iron Rod</hi> in

And now, Madame, I have no hopes to do any good,
for Hope is like Butter, which the Physicians say is
<hi>Gold</hi> in the morning, <hi>Silver</hi> at noon, and <hi>Lead</hi> at night,
in relation to the stomack; So I had golden hopes at

captivity, but my hopes are now turn'd perfect <hi>Lead,</hi>
I am in utter despair to prevail with any; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

blow fair I must think of a departure, and touching
those most Princely civilities, &amp; sublime inexpressible

               <p>Most accomplish'd and heroick Prince, those civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities

due unto you by the common Laws of Hositality,
and you might therby have claim'd them as a Right;
But truly I shold be very well contented if you were
made partaker of your so laudable desires, as to have
som of these metamorphos'd Animals re-transmuted,
that so you might carry with you som <hi>reall</hi> returns of

               <p>Gentle <hi>Bees,</hi> I come hither for no hurt, but for your

that you were once <hi>Intellectuall</hi> Cretures, and the
children of Reson; nay, you were a degree above or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
human happines, being in a contemplative

your selfs from the world with the vanities

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bee.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis tru, we kept that ceremonious outward fire,
but within us we felt too often such flamings, such
furnaces or <hi>Mongibells</hi> of fires, such violent affections
and impetuous desires, that made us half mad for
the time, the sense of our restraint making these fires
far more raging and vehement, for though in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
appeerance and habits, we shew'd som symptoms
of mortification, yet we could never extinguish the
sparks of the <hi>concupiscible</hi> appetite, which is so natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

by your temperat diet, by your abstemious use
and choice of meats, by your so frequent fastings, by
your hard lodgings having matts for your beds, and
stones for your pillows, by your early risings, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always employ'd in somthing or other to avoid
idlenes, which is the Devills couch; I say, by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise

               <p>The operations of nature can hardly be quite sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,

               <p>I cannot deny but that <hi>Naturam sequi, est Deo obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi>
to follow Nature is to obey God, yet as our gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<hi>prudence</hi> is seen in the <hi>conduct</hi> of our naturall pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
so our gretest <hi>prowesse</hi> is seen in the <hi>conquest</hi> of
them, when they grow exorbitant and rebellious;
We need not seek for enemies abroad to exercise our
valour upon, we have too too many within dores, we
have enough of domestic and inmate enemies to cope

               <p>And will you have us to put on that nature again?
But, Sir, besides what we spoke of before, ther was
another thing that did torture us in that <hi>Monastic</hi> life,
it was the apprehension of our captivity, being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester'd
and cut off as it were from the society of
Mankind, &amp; in a manner from the <hi>Living,</hi> 'twixt whom
and us (in that state) ther was this difference, that
they were to die before buriall, but we were buried
before death; Now, ther is nothing so tedious to all
natures as imprisonment, which we shew'd when we
slept in the bosom of our Causes in our mothers
wombs, whence we broke out to get liberty, and to be
a <hi>Nun</hi> is as it were to go into a kind of womb again.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>I, but ther you were in a kind of <hi>Angelicall</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongst those walls, you learnt there how to lead
the lifes of <hi>Angels</hi> upon earth, you were as so many
<hi>fixed</hi> Starrs which being the higher are more noble,
and nearer the throne of the Almighty, than the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi>
which wandring up and down never keep the

               <speaker>Bee.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, under favor, we are not of that opinion; For
you know the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> are called the <hi>Great
Luminaries</hi> in Heven, therfore they must be the more
noble, specially the <hi>Sun,</hi> wherin God himself is said to
have his <hi>habitation,</hi> or Imperiall Throne, whence he
sees the motion of the Universe, and over-looks all
his cretures throughout the world; Now, these noble
Erratic Starrs are in a perpetuall progresse, which the
<hi>Moon</hi> finisheth in twenty nine daies, <hi>Mercury</hi> in four-score,
<hi>Venus</hi> nine months, the <hi>Sun</hi> in a year, <hi>Mars</hi>
in two, <hi>Iupiter</hi> in twelve, and <hi>Saturn</hi> in thirty years.</p>

               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>fixed</hi> Starrs have also a motion within their
own Orbs, and the <hi>Convent</hi> wherein you were before
might be called a <hi>Constellation of fixed Starrs,</hi> which I
say do move within the circumference of their own
Spheres, as you did within the walls of your Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
amongst your selfs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bee.</speaker>
               <p>But by the condition wherin we are now stated, we
may be said to have a larger <hi>Beeing,</hi> for we have turn'd
our <hi>Convent</hi> to a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> or rather our <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>
to a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> wherin we have as exact an oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
and politicall rules of Government, as ever
we had in our <hi>Monastery;</hi> We have a Souvrain King,
who although he hath no sting as all the rest have, yet
he carrieth such a Majesty that makes us all exactly
obedient to his commands; Nor, though he bear no
arms himself, was ther ever heard of any <hi>Rebellion</hi>
amongst us against our lawfull Prince, as is so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
amongst Mankind; It being a principle from the
very instinct of nature amongst us, that it is both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
and damnable for Subjects to rise up against
their supream Governour, and go about to right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs
by Arms; I say, that in this state we have a very
regular Government, we have a King, we have privy
Counsellors, we have Commanders in the War, and
gregarian Soldiers; We keep close in Winter, and
have then our Centinells; We go not abroad till
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98502:80"/>
Beans do blossom, and then, if the weather permit,
ther's never a day passeth in idlenesse; We first build
our Cells and Combs, then make Hony, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender;
We make our Wax and Hony of the freshest
and most fragrant flowers, and abhor withered or
stinking vegetalls; When the flowers are spent in one
place, we have our harbingers abroad to find out an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
being surprised by night in our expeditions, we
sleep in a supine posture with our bellies upward, to
preserve our wings from the falling dew; Betimes in
the morning we are awakned by our Drummer, who
punctually performs his office that way; Then, if the
day be mild, we fally forth in a great body, and we
have an instinct to foresee winds, tempests, and rain,
which makes us keep often within; When we go
abroad to work, every one hath his task, and the
younger are put to the hardest, while the elder labour
within dores; We all feed together, and if we be
surprised abroad with a sudden wind, we take up a
stone 'twixt our feet to give weight to our bodies,
that they may not be blown away; Ther is among us
a Censor of manners, and som Officers that watch
those which are slothfull, who are afterwards pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with death, and for the <hi>Drones,</hi> which are a
spurious kind of brood, we quite banish them; Ther's
not the least foulnes seen in our Alvearies or Hives,
for we abhor all immundicities and sordidnes; When
'tis towards night, our hummings lessen by degrees,
till an Officer fly about and command silence and
sleep, which is instantly done; We first build houses
for our Workmen and Plebeans, and then palaces for
the Nobles and the King; We punish sloth without
mercy; we faithfully obey our King, being always
about him like a guard, and He in the midst; When
the peeple are at work, He goes about and cherisheth
them, He onely being exempt from labour; He hath
always his Officers ready to punish Delinquents;
When He goes forth, the whole Swarm attends him,
if He chance to be weary, we bear him upon our shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
Whersoever He rests, there the generall Rande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98502:81"/>
is; Wasps, Hornets, and Swallows are enemies
to us; We bury our dead with great solemnity; At
the Kings death ther is a generall mourning and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
with a cessation from labour, and we use to go
about his body with a sad murmur for many daies;
When we are sick we have attendants appointed us,
and the symptoms when we be sick are infallible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the honest plain Poet,

                     <l>If <hi>Bees</hi> be sick (for all that live must die)</l>

                     <l>Their bodies are discoloured, and their face</l>
                     <l>Looks wan, which shews that death comes on apace;</l>
                     <l>They carry forth their dead, and do lament,</l>
                     <l>Hanging o'th' dore, or in their Hives are pent:</l>
                     <l>Hunger and cold consumes them, you shall find</l>
                     <l>They buzz as doth t'th' woods the Southern wind,</l>
                     <l>Or as the Sea when as the waves return,</l>
                     <l>Or fire clos'd up in vaults with noise doth burn.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor are we profitable onely in our lifes unto Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
by that pretious Hony we confect for their use,
which though for the rare vertues and sweetnes
therof som held to be the gelly of the Starrs, others
the sweat of the Hevens, others the quintessence of
the Air, though really it be but our <hi>Chylus</hi> at the third
digestion; I say, that we are not onely in our <hi>lifes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
to mankind, who receives the fruits of our
labours, but after <hi>death</hi> also; Our bodies pounded and
drunck with wine, or any other diareticall thing,
cures the Dropsie, Stone, and Strangury; The hony
scrapt off our dead bodies is extraordinary good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
divers diseases; Moreover we have a kind of
transmigration among us, one into the other; Out of
our brains, marrow, and chine-bones, Kings and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
are bred, out of the rest of our bodies ordinary
Bees.</p>

               <p>I shall endeavour to satisfie you touching these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
It must be consider'd, that <hi>Man</hi> may be call'd
the great <hi>Amphybium</hi> of nature; First, he is a confus'd
lump of dead matter, lying as it were upon the lees in
the womb, where the <hi>vegetable</hi> Soul enters first, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it capable of extension and growth; Then the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi>
Soul follows, who by the plasticall vertu falls
a forming the members or the organs; Then comes the
noblest of all the three, the <hi>Rationall</hi> Soul, who
swayes o're the other two, and is—<hi>Divinae particula
aurae,</hi> she is breath'd from the Creator himself, and
which no other creture in Heven or earth can say, she
is capable of a spirituall <hi>Regeneration</hi> afterwards, as
the Body is of a <hi>Resurrection;</hi> At last, when she hath
shaken off the slough of flesh, she becomes a <hi>Spirit</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good or bad, she becomes a <hi>Saint</hi> or a <hi>Devill,</hi> and
so receives eternall <hi>beatitude</hi> or <hi>torments;</hi> By these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
observable it is, that <hi>Man</hi> hath potentially in
himself all created natures, first or last, both in Heven,
Earth, and Hell; All which may be compris'd in this
Poem, which, though short, containeth the whole
story of Mankind from first to last.

                        <hi>Man</hi> is that great <hi>Amphybium</hi> in whom lye</l>
                     <l>Three distinct Souls by way of trigony;</l>
                     <l>He runs through all creations by degrees,</l>
                     <l>First, He is onely <hi>Matter</hi> on the lees,</l>

                     <l>Enables her to be <hi>Regenerat:</hi>

                     <l>To perfect her beatitude or pain:</l>

               <p>Whereas you alledg, that the <hi>Intellectuall</hi> or <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
Soul enters by Divine infusion, I remember when
I was a <hi>Nun,</hi> that divers learned men were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>she</hi> was (like the other two Souls, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
and the <hi>Sensitive</hi>) propagated and traduc'd by the
seed and sperm of the parents, and that this was done
by the hereditary vertu of that gran universall Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
pronounced by God himself to all his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>Encrease and multiply;</hi> Then they proceeded to
urge the common Axiom, that <hi>like begets the like;</hi>
Now, the great God of Nature did constitut all other
species perfect in their own kinds, with a procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power to beget their like by a compleat generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
And why shold <hi>Man,</hi> in whom the ideas of all
other created natures are collectively resplendent?
Why shold he, I say, com short of this perfection and
priviledge? for without it he may be ranck'd among
those mutilat defective cretures, who are destitut of
power to procreat an <hi>Individuum</hi> like themselfs.</p>

               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>This shews the eminency of the <hi>human</hi> Soul above
others in point of extraction, for if she were made of
such poor frail ingredients as the seeds of the parents,
she wold be perishable with the <hi>Body,</hi> wheras the is
created to be heir of Eternity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bee.</speaker>
               <p>I remember the reply to this, That the excellency
of the <hi>human</hi> Soul is not to be derived from her crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and first materialls, but from the <hi>Fiat,</hi> or eternall
Decree, and particular blessing of the Creator, who
endowed her from the beginning with such a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
out of his free will and plesure, to be capable
of eternity: But wheras you aver, that the parentall
feeds are too grosse ingredients to produce so noble a
Soul, I remember ther are great modern Doctors and
Physitians who hold, that neither the seed of mother
or father go to the impregnation, but that the Female
conceives onely by a virtuall contact, as the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
draws Iron, and that she is made pregnant by
conceiving the generall <hi>Idaea</hi> without matter; To
make this new assertion good, they compare the
womb to the brain, and that what the phantasma or
appetit is in the brain, the same phantasma or its ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
is excited in the womb, for both of them are
call'd <hi>Conceptions.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>This is a wild extravagant opinion, for one may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
with more reson, that the <hi>Tumontian</hi> Mares are
impregnated, and made to conceive by the South-west
winds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bee.</speaker>
               <p>I remember another argument that was urged
for the <hi>traducible</hi> generation of the human Soul,
which was, that the <hi>Rationall</hi> Soul begins to operat in
the prolificall seed the very first moment of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as soon as the prolificall emissions of both sexes
are blended by mutuall fermentation, for then the
conformative and proper operations of the <hi>Rational</hi>
Soul begin upon the Embryo, who proceeds to majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98502:83"/>
and augmentation accordingly; And it is no
lesse then an absurdity to think, that the Infant after
conception shold be majorated by the influence of
any other <hi>Soul</hi> then that from whom he received his
<hi>formation;</hi> Now, that this formation begins instantly
after the <hi>conception,</hi> appeers by the early activity of
nature, which hath bin sensibly discover'd in abortive
Embryo's by autopicall observations, wherby it
hath bin visibly found, that a Septenary Slip put into
clear water, a subtle Inspector through a magnifying
Glasse may discern all the rudiments of the organicall
parts; Ther may be seen there the generall conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
faculty in the seed, wherin will visibly appeer
three small bubling conglobations, which are the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls
of the noblest parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Brain,</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi>
and the <hi>Liver;</hi> ther will appeer also two small black
Orbs, or atomicall points, which are the rudiments
of the <hi>Eyes:</hi> Whence may be strongly inferred, that
if organization, and the conformation of the Infant
begins in the very punctillio or first moment of the
conception, that the <hi>Rationall</hi> Soul <hi>then</hi> works in the
seed, as being the most vigorous part of it; From hence
it follows, that <hi>Man</hi> doth absolutely procreat <hi>Man,</hi>
which could not be if the Genitor did not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat
the <hi>Human</hi> Soul unto his Issue; For since <hi>Man</hi> is
compos'd of Soul and Body, if the parent cannot can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
impart both to his ofspring, he may be said to be
inferiour to Beasts, who have intrinsic active princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and power in themselfs to propagat, and beget
<hi>Individiums</hi> of their own species, without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of extrinsecall causes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>These are neotericall fancies, and derogatory to the
noblenes of the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul, who hath a far more

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bee.</speaker>
               <p>But to let passe this <hi>Quaere,</hi> how and when the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>
Soul informs and actuats the Embryo, ther have
bin great researches and indagations made, whether
<hi>this</hi> Soul being so distinct from the <hi>Vegetal</hi> and <hi>Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:98502:83"/>
in her operations, whether, I say, she hath any
particular domicile or cell within the human body
for her own residence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>It was never found yet by any inspections which
the <hi>Naturalists</hi> and <hi>Anatomisers</hi> have made, that the
<hi>Rationall</hi> Soul hath any peculiar lodging, proper onely
to her self, and differing from other Animals; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indivisible, inextensive, and without parts, she is
<hi>tota in toto &amp; tota in qualibet parte,</hi> she is all in the
whole, and whole in every part of the <hi>compositum,</hi> she
is diffus'd up and down the whole masse or fabric of
flesh, ther being no movement at all without her; For
as the beams or light of the Sun displayeth it self
every where through the whole Hemisphere, yet hath
it no particular mansion in any place more then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
so the <hi>Rationall</hi> Soul, which is a <hi>beam</hi> of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
diffuseth her self through the whole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosm
of Man to quicken it, yet she hath no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
residence in any part; 'Tis tru, that she is <hi>radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
in the heart, and <hi>principally</hi> in the brain, which
is as it were her Capitol, and the seat of the Animal-spirits;
Thence she issueth forth her commands, and
dividing her Empire into a Triarchy, she governs by
three Viceroys, the three <hi>Faculties,</hi> who though they
are absolutely distinct by their Commissions, and keep
their Courts in severall Regions, yet are they united
by so indissoluble a league, and sympathetic alliance,
that the prosperitie of one enlargeth the principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the other, and the detriment of each threatens
the integrity of the whole; The Natural or <hi>Vegetal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>
claims superiority of time in order of procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as being Governesse of our <hi>Minority,</hi> commanding
the third part of our lises; The <hi>Vital</hi> hath prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
in order of necessity, keeping her Court chiefly
in the Heart, which is the first part that lives, and the
last that dies; thence she transmits a souvrain and
conservatory influence through all the members,
without which the whole Man must in the fleetest arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of time be but a Cadaver; The <hi>Animal</hi> Faculty chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98502:84"/>
supermacy in order of eminence, as regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the sublimer actions, as <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the <hi>Memory, Understanding,</hi> and <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
to which, as to their perfection, the two former
are design'd.</p>
               <p>Therefore, gentle <hi>Bees,</hi> think speedily on the free
proposall I have made, and of the fair opportunity
you have offered you to be reinform'd with <hi>Rational</hi>
Souls, and to return to the Religious Convent you
came from, where being wean'd from the frail world,
together with the cares and encumbrances therof;
Where, by the constant practise of holy duties night
and day, you may act the parts of <hi>Angels</hi> upon earth,
and afterwards of tru <hi>Angels</hi> in the land of Eternity:
Therfore shake off this despicable poor <hi>humming</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and go again to sing Hymns and Halleluiahs to
your Creator.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bee.</speaker>
               <p>Know, Sir, that <hi>we</hi> have also a <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as
so exact a <hi>Government</hi> among us here; Our <hi>Hummings</hi>
you speak of are as so many <hi>Hymns</hi> to the great God
of Nature; And ther is a miraculous example in <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarius
Cisterniensis,</hi> how som of the holy Eucharist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
let fall in a medow by a Priest, as he was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from visiting a sick body, a Swarm of <hi>Bees</hi> being
hard by took it up, and in a solemn kind of procession
carried it to their Hive, and there erected an Altar of
the purest Wax for it, where it was found in that
form, and untouch'd.</p>
               <p>But whereas you spoke of <hi>Angels,</hi> how do the <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Souls</hi> of good men, when they are exalted to Heven,
differ from the <hi>Angels?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>As they agree, so they differ in many things; <hi>Angels</hi>
and <hi>separated Souls</hi> agree, in that both of them are <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi>
Both of them are Intellectuall and Eternall Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
They both behold the beatificall Vision; Both of
them are Courtiers of Heven, and act meerly by the
understanding, &amp;c. Lastly, They both are Parishioners
of the Church <hi>Triumphant:</hi> Now, as the blessed <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:98502:84"/>
and <hi>Souls separat</hi> do thus agree, So they differ in
many things; They differ in their <hi>Essentialls,</hi> for the
principles of <hi>Angels</hi> are meerly Metaphysicall, <hi>viz.
Essence</hi> and <hi>Existence;</hi> but a <hi>separated Soul</hi> continues
still part of that <hi>Compositum</hi> which formerly consisted
of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form,</hi> and is still apt to be reunited ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
Till then, <hi>she</hi> is not absolutely completed, for all
that while she changeth not her <hi>nature,</hi> but her <hi>state</hi>
of life: Moreover, they differ in the exercise of the
<hi>Understanding,</hi> and manner of knowledge, for a <hi>Soul se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat</hi>
knows still by <hi>discours</hi> and <hi>ratiotination,</hi> which
an <hi>Angell</hi> doth not but by <hi>Intuition;</hi> They also differ
in <hi>dignity of Nature,</hi> for <hi>Angels</hi> have larger Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
At the first instant of their Creation they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the Beatific Vision, the summe of all happines,
yet <hi>separated Souls</hi> are capable to mount up to such a
height of glory by degrees as to be like them in all
things, both in point of <hi>Vision, Adhaesion,</hi> and <hi>Fruition.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>They are divided into three <hi>Hierarchies,</hi> and in every

The second consists of <hi>Dominations,</hi> of <hi>Vertues,</hi> and

partake of divine Illuminations in a greter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:

               <p>Noble Prince, you pleas'd to give divers touches of
the <hi>Immortality</hi> of the <hi>human</hi> Soul, I pray be pleas'd to
illuminat and rectifie our understandings touching
that point.</p>

               <p>Concerning the immortality and incorruptiblenes
of the <hi>Rational Soul</hi> in the World to com, not onely
<hi>Christian Divines,</hi> but the best of <hi>Pagan Philosophers,
Poets,</hi> and <hi>Orators,</hi> have done her that right, as is
evident in their works; Moreover, the Intellectuall
<hi>Human</hi> Soul doth prove her self to be immortall, both
by her <hi>desires,</hi> her <hi>apprehensions,</hi> and her <hi>operations;</hi>
Touching the first, Her <hi>desires</hi> are infinit we know,
and never satisfied in this world; Now, it is a <hi>Maxim</hi>
among the School-men, That ther is no naturall pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
given to any finit creture to be frustraneous; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Her apprehensions or longings after eternall
Truths, which are her chiefest employments, and
most adaequat objects, declare her <hi>Immortall;</hi>
Thirdly, from her <hi>operations,</hi> 'tis known, that all
<hi>corruption</hi> comes from <hi>matter,</hi> and from the clashing of
contraries; Now, when the Soul is sever'd from the
Body, she is elevated beyond the sphere of <hi>matter,</hi>
therfore no causes of mortality can reach her, wherby
her <hi>state</hi> and <hi>operations</hi> pronounce her <hi>immortall,</hi> which
operations she doth exercise without the ministery of
corporeall organs, for they were us'd to be a clog to
her; Add hereunto, that she useth to spiritualize <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall</hi>
things in the Intellect, to abstract Idaeas from
Individualls; She can apprehend <hi>negations</hi> and <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
she can frame <hi>collective notions,</hi> all which actings
conclude her <hi>immateriality,</hi> and as 'twas pointed at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
where no <hi>matter</hi> is found ther's no <hi>corruption,</hi>
and where ther's no <hi>corruption</hi> ther's no <hi>mortality;</hi> Now,
her prime operations being without the ministery of
<hi>Matter,</hi> she may be concluded <hi>immortall</hi> by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
principle, <hi>Modus operandi, sequitur modum essendi,</hi>
Operations are according to the <hi>essence</hi> of every
thing; Now, in the World to com, the Soul shall be
in a state of pure independent <hi>Beeing,</hi> for ther will be
neither action or passion in that state; Whence may
be inferr'd, she shall never perish, in regard that all
<hi>corruption</hi> comes from the action of another thing upon
<hi>that</hi> which is corruptible, therfore that thing must
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98502:86"/>
be capable to be made better or worse; Now, if a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat
Soul</hi> be plac'd in her ultimat and utmost state,
that she can be made <hi>neither,</hi> it follows, that she can
never lose the <hi>Beeing</hi> she hath; Besides, since the egress
out of the body doth not alter her <hi>nature,</hi> but onely
her <hi>condition,</hi> it must be granted, that she was of the
same nature while she continued <hi>incorporated,</hi> though
in that kind of imprisonment she was subject to be
forg'd as it were by the hammer of <hi>materiall</hi> objects
beating upon her, yet so, as she was still of her self
what she was; Therefore when she goes out of the
passible ore wherein she suffer'd, by reson of the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and impurity of that ore, she immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
impassible, and a fix'd subject of her own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>simple pure Beeing;</hi> Both which (as a
most noble Knight Sir. <hi>K. D.</hi> hath it) may be illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in some mesure by what we find passeth in the
coppilling of a fixed metall, which as long as any
lead or drosse or any allay remains with it, continueth
still melting, flowing, and in motion under the muffle;
but as soon as they are parted from it, and that 'tis
become pure, defaecated, without mixture, and single
of it self, it contracts it self to a narrower room, and
instantly ceaseth from all motion, it grows hard, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,
and resistent to all force of fire, admitting
no change or diminution in its substance by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
violence; In like manner it may be said, when
the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul departs from the drossy ore of the
Body, and comes to be her <hi>single self,</hi> she is like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
Gold, and reduc'd to the utmost perfection; She
can be no more liable to any diminution, to action or
passion, or any kind of alteration, but continues fix'd
for ever in the full fruition of unconceivable blisse
and glory.</p>

               <speaker>Bee.</speaker>
               <p>Excellent Prince, these are high abstracted notions,
transcending the reach of vulgar capacities; But you
were pleased to reflect somwhat upon the blisfulnes
and joys of the <hi>human</hi> Soul in the other world, I pray
be pleas'd to enlarge your self upon this Theme.</p>

               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:98502:86"/>
               <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
               <p>These joys, as they are beyond <hi>expression,</hi> so they are
beyond all <hi>imagination;</hi> That vast <hi>Ocean</hi> of Felicity
which the <hi>separat Soul</hi> is capable to receive cannot
flow into her, untill those <hi>banks</hi> of earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall</hi>
walls of flesh be removed; Those infinit joys
which the <hi>human Soul</hi> shall be ravish'd withall in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
are unmeasurable, and beyond any mathematicall
reaches; They have length without points, breadth
without lines, depth without surface; They are even
and uninterrupted joys, but to go about to expresse
them in their perfection were the same task, as to go
about to measure the Ocean in Cockle-shells, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the nomber of the sands with peeble stones;
Touching these faint and fading plesures among the
<hi>Elements,</hi> we use to desire them when we <hi>need</hi> them,
and when we have them, the <hi>desire</hi> presently langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
in the <hi>fruition;</hi> Moreover, we use to love earthly
things most when we want them, and lesse when we
have them; The daintiest meats and drinks nauseat
after fulness; Carnall delights cause sadnes after the
enjoyment; All plesures breed not onely a satiety but
a disgust, and the contentment terminats with the
act: 'Tis otherwise with Celestiall things, they are
most lov'd when they are enjoy'd, and most coveted
when they are had; They are always full of what is
desir'd, and the desire still lasteth, but it is a co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat
desire of complacency and continuance, not an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit
after more, because they are perfect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs;
Yet ther is still a Desire, and a Satiety, but the
one finds no want, nor can the other breed a surfet;
The higher the plesure is, the more full and intense
is the fruition, and the oftner 'tis repeted the more
the appetit encreaseth; Whence this conclusion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that ther can be no proportion at all betwixt
the joys of a <hi>separat Soul,</hi> and those of a <hi>Soul embodyed;</hi>
For the least dram of the spirituall joyes in Heven is
more than the whole Ocean of fleshly contentments;
One drop of those abstracted, those pure, permanent;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98502:87"/>
&amp; immarcescible delights is infinitly more sweet, than
all those mix'd and muddy streams of corporeall and
mundan plesures, then all those no other then <hi>Utopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
delights of this transitory world, were they all cast
into a Limbeck, and the very Elixir of them distill'd
into one vessell.</p>

               <p>Incomparable Prince, you have conquer'd us with
such strong <hi>Herculean</hi> Resons, you have raised our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
with such high raptures, and so illuminated our
understandings, that by the gracious <hi>Fiat</hi> of the great
God of Nature, and the favour of Queen <hi>Morphan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi>
his handmaid in this particular, we are willing to
resume our first shapes, and so return to our dear
<hi>Country</hi> and <hi>Cloysters,</hi> where the remembrance of this
<hi>transfiguration,</hi> we hope, will turn to our advantage;
In the interim, we render you most humble and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thanks in the highest degree that can be imagin'd,
for your flexanimous and hevenly perswasions, which
we found so melting and sweet, that we may justly
think <hi>Bees</hi> sat upon your lips, as they did upon <hi>Plato</hi>'s,
in your cradle, or that you might be nurs'd with <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
in lieu of <hi>Milk,</hi> as <hi>Pindarus</hi> the Prince of <hi>Lyricks</hi>
was; And because <hi>Poesie</hi> is the gretest light whereby
the <hi>Rational Soul</hi> may be discerned to be a <hi>Ray of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
we will conclude with som Enthusiasms to
blissfull Heven and the Hierarchies therof in this

            <p>THer is a <hi>Saying,</hi> that hath gain'd the repute of
a <hi>Proverb,</hi> (though it be also a kind of <hi>Reproach</hi>)
That the <hi>French</hi> neither sings as he pricks, nor thinks
as he speaks, nor <hi>speaks as he writes;</hi> The first proceeds
from abundance of spirits, and his volatil airy nature;
The second from his Exces of Complements; The
third, because he wold have his Language retain still
of the <hi>Romand</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Toung; Therfore when he
writes <hi>Temps, Corps, Estoille, Advocats, &amp;c.</hi> which com
from <hi>Tempus, Corpus Stella, Advocati,</hi> he pronounceth
them, <hi>Tan, Cors, Etoilis, Avocà;</hi> The <hi>English</hi> may be said
to be as guilty hereof, for if the <hi>French</hi> writes, <hi>Apres
la tempeste vient le beau temps,</hi> and pronounceth, <hi>Apre
la tampete vien le bou tan,</hi> After a Storm comes a Calm;
If the <hi>French</hi> writes, <hi>Les Advocats bastissent leuers mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
de testes de fols,</hi> and pronounceth, <hi>Les avocà batisset
leur mesons de tete de fous,</hi> Lawyers build their houses
of Fools heads, (viz. <hi>Clients</hi>) The <hi>English</hi> comes not
short of him, for wheras he writes, <hi>God give you good
Evening,</hi> he often saies, <hi>Godi godin;</hi> Wheras he
writes, <hi>Much good may it do unto you,</hi> he often pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
<hi>Musgiditty:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> do labor daily to reform
this, and to bring both Writing and Pronounciation to
be consonant, by retrenching the superfluous letters,
for wheras they were used to write, <hi>Les Epistres que les
Apostres ont Escrit,</hi> they now write as they pronounce,
<hi>Les Epitres que les Apotres ont ecrit:</hi> It hath bin the aim
of the Author in this Book (and others) to do the like,
(though the <hi>Presse</hi> did not observe his <hi>Ortography</hi> so
<pb facs="tcp:98502:89"/>
punctually). Now, Strangers use to quarrel with our
Language, and throw away the Book in a chase som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
because our writing and pronunciation are so
differing; For when a stranger meets with <hi>treasure,
measure, feature, reader, weather, people,</hi> &amp;c. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
<hi>tre-asure, me-asure, fe-ature, re-ader, we-ather,
pe-ople;</hi> When he meets with <hi>witnesse, sicknesse, wittie,
prettie, pittie, starre, warre, &amp;c.</hi> he pronounceth
<hi>witness-e, sickness-e, witti-e, pretti-e, pitti-e, starr-e,
warr-e, &amp;c.</hi> Wheras if we wold write them as wee
pronounce them, <hi>viz. Tresure, mesure, feture, reder,
wether, peeple, witnes, sicknes, witty, pretty, pitty, star, war,</hi>
&amp;c. (which gives altogether as full a prolation) stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
wold not find such a difficulty and distast in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our Language; It hath bin, and is still the ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of the Author to reform this, as also to bring those
words which are derived from the <hi>Latin</hi> Toung to
follow her <hi>Ortography</hi> rather then the <hi>French,</hi> wherby
divers Letters are sav'd, as <hi>Magic, Tysic, Colic, Favor,
Lahor, &amp;c.</hi> not <hi>Magique, Physique, Cholique, Favour,
Labour, &amp;c.</hi> For as it is a Principle in <hi>Philosophy, Encia
non sunt frustra multiplicanda,</hi> Entities are not to be
multiplied in vain, so it may as well hold in <hi>Ortogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
That Letters are not to he multiplied to no purpose;</hi>
Add hereunto the <hi>Topicall</hi> Rule, (as the Author ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves

per pauciora,</hi> More is waste, whe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
