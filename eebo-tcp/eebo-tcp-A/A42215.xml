         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thought good

it may bee ſaid that the

the providence, the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and the like, ſheweth us,
that his moſt eſſentiall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

the reall diſtinction, admitted by
ſacred Divinity, betweene the
Divine perſons is not ſufficient to
make the Son not to be the ſame
with the Father, and both one
with the holy Ghoſt. Nor doth
that infinite variety of divers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whereof this artificial

beſides the univerſall dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:9"/>
which they have from one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
refuſe the bond of peace,
wherewith they are ſtraightly
joined together. For proof of the
firſt, the efficacy wherewith the
ſame God, did ſo much give in
charge and urge unto his choſen
people the unity of his divine
nature, ſhall ſerve me for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
reaſon, he ſaying unto
them a thouſand times; <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
O Iſrael! thy God is one, and
one is his name.</hi> Which wordes
as they are moſt true, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproovable
witneſſes of this
truth, ſhall ſave me a labour of
proving it by naturall, and theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall
reaſons.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, which is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency
which all creatures
have, from one onely beginning,
may be plainly demonſtrated by
that which hiſtoricall <hi>Moſes</hi> writ
<pb facs="tcp:57128:10"/>
the beginning of his ſacred hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
attributing the creation of the
world to one ſole cauſe. Which
truth that great <hi>Mercurius Triſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megiſtus</hi>
did alſo leave engraven
in pure Emerald, beeing there
in followed by the whole troop
of Philoſophers, who unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
confeſſed one firſt cauſe,
eternall, independent, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall;
needing therein no other
Tutor, but onely the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
reaſon. And if any curious
man ſhould aske me the proof of
the third point, he may yeeld
himſelfe ſatisfaction, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the ſtreight bonds, and
intrinſecall union, wherewith all
natures doe linke themſelves
one with another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untill they
come unto the firſt linke from
whence they were taken. Nor
let any one thinke this union, and
<pb facs="tcp:57128:10"/>
naturall concord of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to be a borrowed perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
or accidentally belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto them: ſeeing that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
architect, who made all
thinges deliberately, and with
wiſdome, and meaſure; having
ſet every one of them in their
owne poſte, and place conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for their natures, gave unto
them all joined together union,
for the center of their preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And that ſo properly, and
intrinſecally, that if the ſaid uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could be broken, the whole
frame of the world whoſe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
conſiſteth in the recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
conſonancy of all its parts,
would be brought to nothing.</p>
               <p>He that ſhall with particular
attention conſider the ſeven
rings, or linkes, whereof the
chaine of this world is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:11"/>
ſhall eaſily finde out this
marvailous bond of union. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
from the firſt and laſt,
which is God; who though he
be generally united to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which live in him, ſubſiſt
by him, and move through him;
yet by a more particular aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
he is united unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
nature, as the perfecteſt
of all creatures. This joyneth it
ſelfe with the nature of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
which by reaſon of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptibility,
is the moſt perfect
next unto the Angelicall. To the
celeſtiall enterlaceth it ſelfe the
elementall, in whoſe linke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
the diameter of the chain;
as that, which according to the
order and perfection of nature, is
fartheſt from the firſt. The fifth
is compoſed of the laſt element,
which is the earth: and this is
<pb facs="tcp:57128:11"/>
the firſt linke, which begins to
turne towards it beginning, and
it is the vegetative nature which
intreſſeth it ſelfe with the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and that with the rationall,
which uniting it ſelfe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
with God, ſhuts up the
chaine and circle of this ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And becauſe the laſt knot
or linke of this chaine was to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
it ſelfe with God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God and the creature there
could be no proportion of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
therefore the eternall wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
created the ſoule, which
being immortall and incorpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
ſhould have ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of God, and ſo uniting it
ſelfe perfectly with him, the
chaine of the fabricke of this
world ſhould ſo cloſe up and
ſhut. And in caſe, that ſome
curious body, not content with
<pb facs="tcp:57128:12"/>
the generall union, of the ſeven
rings or linkes, which have bin
ſet downe, ſhould deſire more
particularly to finde out the
point of this trueth, he may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
himſelfe, with the internall
ſearching out of each nature and
linke of the ſaid chaine. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
from the firſt, he ſhall
finde in it an infinite abyſſe of
perfections and attributes, which
are Wiſedome, Omnipotency,
Juſtice, Goodneſſe, Glory, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and innumerable more, which
are all with an unſpeakeable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſibility
gathered in,
and united unto the indiviſible
latchet of the moſt ſimple divine
nature.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond linke,
which is the Angelicall nature,
he may very well apprehend, not
onely by the light of faith, but
<pb facs="tcp:57128:12"/>
alſo by the ſtrength of his owne
underſtanding: the marveilous
order, &amp; perfect concord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
thoſe Angelicall ſpirits are
united together; the Cherubins
joyning themſelves to the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins,
the Seraphins to th' Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels,
they to the Angels,
Thrones, Powers, Dominions,
&amp; the other kinds of the twelve
quires of Angels, with ſuch great
uniformity and concord, as may
be preſumed in that heavenly
commonwealth. Then if we ſhall
caſt our eyes, on the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the third linke, which is
the nature of the heavens, we
ſhall plainly ſee (if <hi>Ptolomie</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us not) that the <hi>primum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi>
is united to the Chriſtalline
heaven, this to the eight ſpheare,
the eighth ſpheare to Saturne,
who joyneth himſelfe to Jove,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:13"/>
Jove to Mars, Mars uniteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to Sol, Sol adheres to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Venus to Mercury, Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Luna, from whoſe hollow
ſuperficies takes it beginning:
the fourth linke of th' Elementall
nature, joyning it ſelfe unto the
annexed fire, it unto the ayre,
whom the element of water fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
untill it comes to unite it
ſelfe unto the earth, which is the
univerſall center of al heavie and
ponderous things.</p>
               <p>From the earth beginnes the
fifth linke, to goe upwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and this is the Vegetative
Nature; which, like unto the reſt,
keepes it dependance and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
united unto all her ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and kindes, beginning from
the biggeſt trees and of greateſt
fruit, even to the loweſt, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt,
and pooreſt graſſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:57128:13"/>
field. In this vegetative nature
conſiſts the baſis and foundation
of the ſenſitive, which is utterly
unable to put in practice th' ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of moving, and feeling
without it. This likewiſe is not
different from the firſt, and hath
it kindes and degrees of ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and dependency, the nobleſt,
and perfecteſt of them, which is
the Lyon, uniting himſelfe to
the pooreſt worme of the earth.
This ſenſitive nature, linkes it
ſelfe at laſt with the rationall,
which being (by meanes of the
ſoule) ſpirituall, exceeds in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
the corporeall, vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and nutritive, remaining at
laſt united with God. So that
the aforeſaid union is not onely
to be found in this whole univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
frame, but alſo in every one
of its parts. It being impoſſible
<pb facs="tcp:57128:14"/>
that there ſhould be any one not
linked and united to the reſt, by
the analogie of ſome attribute,
which is indifferently proper to
them all.</p>
               <p>The little microcoſmos of
man may be an example of this,
her being an epitome and cipher
of the whole fabricke of the
world, in whom all natures are
united, he being participant of
each vertue and perfection; for
he hath his body of the heavens,
elements and ſtones; his vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or growing, from the plants;
his feeling from beaſts, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
from Angels, and the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and likeneſſe of God. And
paſſing to that which is proper
unto this nature, we ſhall finde
that all his actions have a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
one from the other; the
underſtanding being not able to
<pb facs="tcp:57128:14"/>
underſtand any thing, unleſſe it
unite it ſelfe to the ſences; nor
theſe produce any ſenſations or
feelings, unleſſe they joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by meanes of the ſpecies
and image, which preſents it
ſelfe unto them, with the object.
And according to the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
doctrines, the object unites
it ſelfe to the externall ſence, the
externall tranſmits it to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
the common repreſents it
to the phantaſie, from whence
comes the names of phantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes:
With theſe imaginations
doth the active intellect joyne it
ſelfe, illuſtrating them, and with
taking away all their materiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
makes them of ſenſible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.
The active intellect
unites it ſelfe with poſſibility,
which cannot operate, unleſſe
the active diſpoſeth it to it, by
<pb facs="tcp:57128:15"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:15"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:16"/>
repreſenting the ſpecies unto it,
diſrobed of all matter and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.
From thence the intellect
or underſtanding being diſpoſed
produceth its firſt operation,
which is the ſimple apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and this coupleth it ſelfe with
the ſecond; which is affirmation
or negation; from whence grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the third, which is diſcourſe.
The diſcourſe goeth united with
the will, which could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any act of love, or hatred, or
election; if diſcourſe had not
gone before, it being impoſſible
to will or refuſe that which hath
not before bin knowne. So that
all things which are incloſed
within this frame of the world,
are nothing but union, accord,
and amity; not onely through
the dependency which every
thing hath from one ſole begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
<pb facs="tcp:57128:16"/>
but alſo through the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
correſpondency, which they
hold amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>And if any one ſhall aske me
the reaſon of this marvailous
linke, and intrinſecall love wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſo many, and ſo different
natures are linked together, I will
not anſwer them with that which
is ordinarily ſaid, that God had
ſo ordained. But I wil ſay, that the
ſupreame artificer, having deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in the creation of the
world, to make a perfect and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
compound; variety and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
were very requiſite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
it being impoſſible to make
any thing beautifull, which was
not compoſed of varieties, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
if it were in and againſt it
ſelfe divided. To this end he
appointed all creatures (at the
leaſt the corporeall ones) a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:17"/>
and proper meane, which
hindereth all that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the union, and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this world. And this is
that <hi>prima materia,</hi> argued upon
by all, but (as I beleeve) knowne
by none. This <hi>materia</hi> (which
ſome ſay, is <hi>pura potentia;</hi> others
an entitative act; others, that it is
neither <hi>quid</hi> nor <hi>quantum,</hi> nor
<hi>quale</hi>) is a beginning, in the
which ſtand united all corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or bodily natures. It is not
ingendred, nor it doth not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt;
for ſo the union and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
harmony of the world
might come to be loſt, whoſe
preſervation is grounded upon
the incorruptible unity of this
matter. It hath bin created, but
not from everlaſting, as <hi>Plato,</hi>
and others have affirmed; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impious to give or attribute
<pb facs="tcp:57128:17"/>
the glory of eternity, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without a beginning, unto a
creature, which is due onely to
God. Finally, it is ſufficient for
us to know, without engulfing
our ſelves into any other meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſick,
that the matter whereof
all corporall things are framed,
is of one and the ſame kinde; and
by that reaſon, all your materiall
ſpecies or kindes, are united and
coupled together.</p>
               <p>And becauſe that the formes
of the compounds, which muſt
neceſſarily be ſundry and diverſe
to make a perfect and faire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
ſhould not deviate from
that unity, which God ordaines,
and nature pretends: The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Artificer determined
that they ſhould all come forth
of the entrailes of the <hi>materia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
or (as the Divines call it) <hi>de poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
<pb facs="tcp:57128:18"/>
materie,</hi> that ſo in all their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
and changes, they might
be tributary unto that beginning,
out of whoſe bowels and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes
they came: the power of
corrupting, engendring, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
reſting onely in it, as not
being ſubject to goe out of the
bounds of union and peace.</p>
               <p>By this doctrin, is confuted the
opinion of many moderne Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers;
who judging by the
ſence, that which is contrary to
reaſon; beleeve that the formes
of the Elements, have no other
end, then to deſtroy and corrupt.
As for example, the fire, which
we ſee conſumes, and devoures
all as it findes, living in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
warre with the water; as alſo
the earth with the ayre: For if
we leave that ſeemingnes, which
ſence ſheweth us, and examine
<pb facs="tcp:57128:18"/>
the trueth with reaſon, we ſhall
finde, that the elements being
conſtitutive parts, whereof all
your mixtes are compounded,
it is repugnant, and contrary to
them, to have deſtruction be
their end, their nature being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially
ordained to compound.
Whence is concluded, that the
naturall end of the Elements,
is nothing but union. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there ordinarily ſeemes
to be a continuall enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, deſtroying one
another, yet we muſt hold for a
certaine, that this warre is onely
made for the preſervation of
peace and union; ſince the fire in
ſeeking to perſecute its contrary,
doth nothing but ſeeke a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament,
to the rigor of his proper
ſtrength; and any thing elſe
which might hinder the union
<pb facs="tcp:57128:19"/>
and conjunction, whereby the
compound is preſerved.</p>
               <p>So that we will conclude this
Chapter, ſaying, that Union is
an attribute of God, the treaſure
of nature, the naturall center of
creatures, and chain of the whole
world This unites the mortall
with the divine; as the eternall
Word with humane nature. The
mortall with incorruptible, as
the body with the ſoule. The
materiall with the ſpirituall, as
the underſtanding with the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The living with the inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as beaſts with the earth. The
heaven with their elements, the
elements with man, &amp; man with
God. And finally, from God, to
God, there is nothing but peace,
concord, union, agreement and
love.</p>

               <p>FRom the precedent Chapter,
we may by very good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
inferre, that, which we
ſeeke to prove in this: For if u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and peace (as we have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
be Gods attributes, and the
perfection of nature, it is plaine,
that enmity and diſcord (capitall
enemies of union) muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
be contraries to God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
being altogether averſe to
the nobleſt perfection that our
underſtanding can conceive in
God, which is unity and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
wherewith his divine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
and perfections, are ſo
<pb facs="tcp:57128:20"/>
indiviſibly united together, that
no manner of diſtinction can be
admitted betweene them, either
reall, formall, or fundamentall,
as Divines doe terme them; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
we ſhould allow of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of reaſon, which our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
licenciouſly frameth
conceiving that to be diſtinct,
which in it ſelfe is indiviſibly
one. Daily experience ſheweth
us, the great repugnancy, and
contrariety that is betweene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and nature, either of them
ſhewing it by their effects: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the proper and principall
end of the one, is to corrupt, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh,
ruine, and undoe. Of the
other, to generate, to joyne, to
multiply, and unite all wordly
things, with the moſt firme bond
of peace. Becauſe that knowing
by evident induction, that diſcord
<pb facs="tcp:57128:20"/>
and enmity, are enemies unto
God; and the very plagues of
nature, we may, with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
conclude them to be, the
workes of the divell, wrought
by his owne hands: ſo peſtilent
a fruite doubtleſſe proceeding
from ſuch an accurſed tree.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle did in three
wordes admirably ſet downe the
genealogie, and diſcent of this
fierce monſter, ſaying, that
through the divells envy, death
was come into the world.
Wherein we muſt note, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the expoſition of ſome
Doctors) that the Apoſtle in this
place, calleth diſſention, and
diſcord, by the name of death:
And that very properly, ſeeing
that the Doctors meaning by
death, as well the ſoules, as
the bodies death, we ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:57128:21"/>
finde death to be nothing elſe,
but a wretched ſeparation, and
unfortunate divorce tending to
ruine, and perdition. And as
for the death of the body, none
can be ſo ignorant, as to deny
this truth, beholding with his
owne eies, the diſſolution of the
ſtreighteſt, and internalleſt
friendſhip, as humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
can conceive; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that, the miſerable accidents
which ordinarily accompany a
dead carcaſſe. And if this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
bee taken for ſpirituall
death; it being an enmity, and
divorce, between God, and the
ſoule, and not an ordinary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
but an infinite one by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the infinite diſtance, that
is between God and a ſinner:
we ſtill conclude that death, and
diſcord, are one, and the ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:57128:21"/>
ſame thing; and both daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the divell, and envy, as
the Apoſtle ſaith, the motive
which moved the divell, to
bring this accurſed diſſention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, was a cruell, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
rage againſt man: being
not able to endure, that God
ſhould grow enamored, of ſo
ugly, baſe, and wretched a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as humane nature is; and
that he ſhould enrich it, with
ſo many extraordinary favours
&amp; priviledges, as unite himſelfe
hypoſtatically to it, and make it
the inſtrument of redemption;
denying that favour, to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
nature which is more
noble and perfect, then the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane:
and ſo being deſperately
enraged, he contracted matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
with envy, in which
wedlocke, death was borne: ſo
<pb facs="tcp:57128:22"/>
that death, or diſcord, hath the
divell for her father, and envy
for her mother: her grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were pride, and contempt,
and her firſt root was ambition.</p>
               <p>This curſed plant was the firſt
Angels plague, and that which
made him to exceed the bounds
of his owne nature: raſhly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the way unto an unbridled
appetite, and ambitious deſire,
to climbe up unto the heaven of
divine perfection, to place his
throne above the ſtarres, and to
be like unto the moſt high.
Making the conſideration of
himſelfe, and the beauty, and
perfections, wherewith he was
enriched, the inſtruments of ſo
blinde a pretence, and proud ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity.
Judging himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
to be worthy of ſo great an
honour: out of which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:57128:22"/>
grew pride, which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
the raging fire of her
mother ambition, cauſed the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
to forget the reſpect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due unto his creator, and to
become the heire of contempt.
Theſe two fierce monſters of

made ſuch a ſlaughter of that

and goodneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, they did

               <p>With ſuch weapons doth this
fierce Leviathan perſecute man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
and with them he brings
to an end all his pretences: ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
unto his empire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
all the Provinces of the
earth. It being moſt certaine, that
cities ſubject to diſcord and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion,
cannot be free from the
divels bondage, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubject to ruine. The epithets
which the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> gives
unto the citie of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:57128:23"/>
be ſufficient, and faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
for me herein; when he
cals it the citie of blood, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of miſery, the city of death
and perdition; attributing the
cauſe of theſe wretched effects,
to nothing but to the diſcord and
diviſion of her inhabitants. And
he doth with ſo much efficacy,
inſiſt upon this point, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
an infallible curſe upon
that citie, which ſhall ſtand divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and in diſcord. The ſame
doth the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by an enthymeme the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
which comes through diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſaying, Their heart is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and therefore they ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.
And if this be not ſufficient,
let us conſider that wretched
tricke he ſerved our firſt fathers,
in the beginning of the world;
where it being a hard taske to
<pb facs="tcp:57128:24"/>
beat downe ſuch knowledge and
wiſedome, ſo perfectly infuſed,
as <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; his wives was, he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
no other weapons then theſe,
perſwading them, that God had
enjoyned, upon paine of death,
not to taſte of the tree of life;
onely through an artificiall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
becauſe that none ſhould be
ſo wiſe as himſelfe: which he
could ſo well, and with ſuch live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reaſons perſwade them, that
(being already moved with an
ambition and deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
they conceived ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and hatred againſt God,
that caſting away the reſpect and
obedience which they knew was
due unto him, they did contrary
to that which was commanded
them; remaining thereby ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto death, and their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to an abyſſe of miſeries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:24"/>
Let him that is curious, obſerve
for the confirmation of this
truth, the ſentence which God
pronounced againſt the Serpent;
when as being willing to puniſh
him by way of retaliation, or as
they ſay in Latine <hi>poena talionis.</hi>
He tooke for a meanes of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
the ſame way as the
Serpent had taken, to make man
fall from his originall juſtice and
ſtate of innocency; ſaying unto
the Serpent, <hi>I will ſet enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
thee and the woman;</hi> as if
he ſhould more plainly ſay, thou
haſt procured through thine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
perſwaſions and lyes, to
ſet hatred and enmity betweene
the woman and I, to make her a
ſlave, and all her poſterity ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to thy will and tyranny. And
I ſay unto thee, that thou ſhalt be
chaſtized with the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:25"/>
for I will ſowe ſuch terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hatred and deadly antipathy
betwixt you, that you ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
live in continuall warre
and enmity, ſhe endeavouring
with all her might to breake
thine head, and thou to ſet ſnares
for her heele.</p>
               <p>Finally, by meanes of enmity
and hatred, the divell did catch
<hi>Cain,</hi> never letting him reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
he tooke away his brother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi>
life. By meanes of theſe two,
he ſtirred up <hi>Eſau</hi> his anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Iacob, Saul</hi> his revenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
guiltleſſe <hi>Duvid. Pharaohs</hi>
hardneſſe againſt the children of
Iſrael. And with diſſention, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and ambition, the divell
hath brought under his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and obedience, the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and fruitfull Provinces of
the earth; burning up the fruits
<pb facs="tcp:57128:25"/>
of peace, reſpect, feare, reverence
and zeale of the publike welfare
towards them, to whom they
were ſubject, by divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
lawes.</p>
               <p>Many times have I conſidered
that excellent and admirable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
which <hi>Samſon</hi> uſed to
revenge himſelfe upon the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines;
and I truely finde, that it
is the ſame as the divell uſeth to
be revenged upon man; ſince, if
that I well remember the ſtory,
<hi>Samſon</hi> having ſought all the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
wayes, to be revenged of the
wrongs he had received, could
finde none more effectuall then
diviſion, verily beleeving, that
thereby he ſhould ruine all his
enemies goods and wealth; and
to that end he tooke a number of
Foxes, and binding firebrands to
<pb facs="tcp:57128:26"/>
their tailes, he let them run into
the Philiſtines corne fields: The
beaſts feeling themſelves looſe,
began to ſever and divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the fields, with ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
that there were not two
left together, all taking ſeverall
wayes, fixing their eyes towards
their owne homes and terriers.
Which diviſion was the cauſe
that all the corne was burnt up,
leaving the land ſpoyled, and
<hi>Samſon</hi> revenged. With ſuch
like induſtry doth the Divell
ſubject unto his Empire, all the
countries of the world; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
the beſt things he can
finde in them, and leaving them
utterly unable to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Seeing that to turne a
quiet and peaceable citie into
a citie of bloud and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:26"/>
the firſt thing he doth is to
ſtirre up ambition in them whom
he findes moſt diſpoſed thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and alluring them with their
owne proper intereſts, he kindles
the fire of diſcord and diſſention
in ſuch ſort, that it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to pacifie and unite it: the
feare of God, the zeale of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
welfare, the reſpect and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
due to the Prince,
and the charity towards ones
neighbour, are all beaten down:
whence immediatly followeth,
the totall perdition and ruine of
the common-wealth.</p>
               <p>By all this which we have ſaid,
we may ſurely inferre, that ſince
diſcord and diviſion produce no
other fruit but bloud, ruine, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and death, they cannot be
poſitive effects of God, to whom
<pb facs="tcp:57128:27"/>
is repugnant to be the authour of
evill: Nor yet of nature, whoſe
treaſure conſiſts in unitie; but
meerly the Divels, who ſeekes
nothing but to oppoſe himſelfe
to all goodneſſe and perfection,
which God or nature brings
forth in this world. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
effects alſo, which are
found in both, may beare ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
witneſſe to this truth, ſince
that all which God and Nature
pretend, is nothing but peace
and union: that which the Divel
profeſſeth, is nothing but warres,
and diſſention. Nature loves
preſervation; the Divell ruine;
that to generate, this to deſtroy.
Nature finally deſires to make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing like unto it ſelfe, by
means of peace, love and union:
the Divell ſtrives to ſubject eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:57128:27"/>
thing under his dominion, by
meanes of diviſion, hatred and
diſcord. Therefore ſuch effects
being directed unto ſuch a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
and perverſe end as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
wee cannot attribute
them to God; to whom, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his infinite goodneſſe and
perfection, is not onely repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to be authour of evill, as the
Apoſtle ſaith, but alſo to will it
or deſire it.</p>
               <p>And if any ſelfe-weening, or
peeviſh man ſhould contrary
this, alledging the words of the
Prophet, who ſaid, <hi>There is no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
done in the Citie but God doth
it:</hi> and likewiſe the words of the
Apoſtle in the ninth chapter to
the Romans, where he ſeemes to
prove, that God is cauſe of the
evill which is done in the world:
<pb facs="tcp:57128:28"/>
he may ſatisfie himſelfe with the
Fathers of the Churches ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
expoſition of thoſe places;
conſidering that in evill, or ſin,
there are two things, whereof
the one is the materiall of it,
which is the phyſicall action, or
reall execution, to which God
doth poſitively concurre, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impoſſible for the creature to
doe any reall act without the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
concurrencie of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
Since that all that is in the
world, lives and is preſerved
through him: and in this ſenſe
are to be underſtood thoſe texts
which prove God to be the cauſe
of evill.</p>
               <p>But the formall, and malicious
part of ſinne, as the deformity of
it, and privation of righteouſnes,
depends onely from our free and
<pb facs="tcp:57128:28"/>
abſolute will, and not poſitively
from God. Becauſe if that were
ſo, God ſhould not onely goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his ſupreame perfection of
being God, but ſhould alſo bee
unjuſt in puniſhing man; he not
being the true and immediate
cauſe of ſinne. And ſo we muſt
freely confeſſe, that the proper
and eſſentiall cauſe of ſinne, is
the maliciouſneſſe of our will,
depraved both by it ſelfe, and by
the Divels temptations.</p>
               <p>And though we finde in holy
Scripture, that many times God
puniſheth one ſinne with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> inſolencie with
the hardneſſe of his heart; the
Phariſees incredulity with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
we cannot for all that ſay,
that God is the authour of evill;
becauſe that although thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:57128:29"/>
which God puniſheth with, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
in themſelves, are ſinnes;
yet if they bee conſidered as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the divine juſtice, to
which belongeth to reward and
puniſh every one according to
their deſert, they ought not, nor
cannot be ſo called. And ſo our
concluſion alwayes remains true,
that enmities, warres, diſcords,
diviſions, and other ſuch like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
are workes of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.</p>

that it goeth beyond the

therefore he ſaid very well, who

which is the earth; out of

               <p>And if we will ſhew his begi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

which moſt patient <hi>Iob</hi>

none of <hi>Adams</hi> children, that

becauſe he never continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

and unſafe veſſell, into which,
as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, the

that though his phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

that man, having no

but that the baſeneſſe

invite him to peace, amity,

               <p>And though theſe foreal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

with all the reſt, might move

the holy Ghoſt in <hi>S<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lomons</hi>
bookes, and nature it ſelfe, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
us, that all thinges doe
<pb facs="tcp:57128:32"/>
love their like; which being
moſt true, it ſhall alſo bee more
reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible in man, to perſecute
one another, then in any other
creature: ſeeing that amongſt
all the created ſpecies, there
is not any that hath its particulars
more like, equall and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
then man, reſerving its ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
and quality ſo wel, both
in the beginning, middle and
end; that there is not the leaſt tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of difference: For as for the
beginning, it is well knowne, that
they all came out of the duſt, or
ſlime of the earth, and that they
were all borne naked, and came
into the world weeping. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
of the end may bee
known by the univerſall attribute
which all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity doe
owe unto their birth. Since that
<pb facs="tcp:57128:33"/>
neitehr Scepter, nor Miter could
ever finde any Antidote, or ſpell
againſt death. And as for the
middle, which is from the time
of their birth, untill death, wee
have already ſaid with <hi>Iob,</hi> that
mans life is a continuall warfare,
full of all manner of afflictions,
and calamities, as may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
or imagined. And this is
univerſall and common to all,
there being none exempt from
croſſes.</p>
               <p>So that there being in man a
perfect, and totall ſimilitude
with all his particulars, and all
agreeing in one, and the ſame
degree of miſery, baſeneſſe, and
calamity, there being none in
this more noble, or priviledged
then others; we conclude that
pride, and perſecuting of his like
<pb facs="tcp:57128:33"/>
in man, is a monſter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy
of nature and a frenzy of
the underſtanding. Hee being
by his baſeneſſe bound to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
himſelfe; and by his equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
tyed to love thoſe of his owne
ſpecies. Whence I doe inferre,
that your naturalliſts doe with
very good reaſon, call the Lyon
King of the Beaſts; and preferre
him before other Beaſts for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
and ſtrength; becauſe
God made him advantaged, and
ſhewing oddes of the reſt, but
by what reaſon can one man
eſteeme himſelfe to bee more
then another? What preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or excellency did nature
grant unto him, which ſhe deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to other men? which being
moſt certaine, wee may ſecurely
ſay, that a man which is proud,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:34"/>
and at enmity with another; is
worſer then the Divell, or to ſay
better, pride, and ambition, is not
ſo unproper for the Divell as for
man. Becauſe if Lucifer did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to ſet his throne above the
ſtarres, to be like unto the moſt
high, and had other fooliſh fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and raſh propoſitions;
though hee had no true nor reall
ground for it, the creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
incapable of the creators
perfection and nobleneſſe: yet
he ſaw, and knew in himſelfe
ſome likelihood, and colour for
his unbridled appetite; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelfe immortall, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall,
and the moſt beautifull
of all creatures; being as <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
ſaith, not onely a bright ſhining
ſtarre, but Lucifer unto the
morne, and the moſt perfect of
<pb facs="tcp:57128:34"/>
all other angelicall ſpirits. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the whole army of Divells
is united, and concordant in the
perſecution of the ſoule, one not
entermedling in the others of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
nor endeavouring to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe
or croſſe the temptation,
that another ſhall intend.</p>
               <p>Whereby it is proved, that
man being the moſt abject, and
wretched creature, and having
nothing but what other men are
alſo partakers of; growing
proud, and perſecuting another
man, hee goeth beyond the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a brute beaſt, and is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
then the Divell himſelfe.</p>

               <p>THE concluſion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Chapter, gives us
great occaſion to treate in this
Chapter of the nobleneſſe of
man, and of his excellencies, by
reaſon of a motive any one may
have to wonder at our laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
wherein we concluded,
that man is the moſt abject, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
and wretched creature
of the world: Which being
conſidered at the firſt ſight, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
quite contrary to that
which both Scripture and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Philoſophy teacheth us,
Canonizing man for the nobleſt
and perfecteſt creature. And
truely if we doe with particular
<pb facs="tcp:57128:35"/>
attention conſider, that high
ſublime and lofty degree of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe
and perfection which
man attained unto by that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaticall
union, which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
word made in the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wee ſhall freely confeſſe
that it is the nobleſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt
of all creatures; ſince the
angelicall nature did not onely
remaine inferior to it, but alſo
ſubject to adore it in Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.
Whence (as ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
teſtifie) the firſt Angell
tooke occaſion to rebell againſt
his Creator, not being able to
brooke the exaltation of humane
nature, and the extraordinary
and exquiſite favors, which by
revelation hee knew God would
communicate unto it.</p>
               <p>Neither is that proofe which
<pb facs="tcp:57128:36"/>
is ordinarily brought by them
who thinke man inferiour to the
Angell, of any great force or
power; for whereas the vulgar
tranſlation ſaith: <hi>Thou haſt made
him little leſſe then the Angels,</hi>
the Hebrew hath it, <hi>Thou haſt
made him little leſſe then Eloim;</hi>
which according to ſome Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins
interpretation, ſignifies, that
man is little leſſe then God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that the word <hi>Eloim</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
many times God, and many
times Angell. And that expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not much out of purpoſe,
but grounded upon very good
reaſon: for if we attentively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that marvellous union
which God made with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
we ſhall finde that Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithetes
were thereby ſo appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
unto man, that it may
<pb facs="tcp:57128:36"/>
truly be ſaid, that man is little
leſſer then God; which thing the
Angell cannot glory in, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deprived of ſo notable a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>And although in all creatures
there bee in ſome faſhion a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
reſemblance of God, yet it
is more perfect in man then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the reſt, ſince that in none
but man is to be found the Word
incarnate. His compoſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of Soule, whoſe three
powers are correſpondent to the
three divine perſons; and of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which united to the ſoule, is
correſpondent to the divine
Word, in which are divinely u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Body, and Divinity. And
of all this the Angell is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
becauſe he is incorporeall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:37"/>
The Divines call theſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
perfections of meere
grace, becauſe that God would
out of his will and mercie ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
this nature, though ſhee
could no way deſerve it by any
vertue or excellencie. And in
this all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, that human nature
is more noble then the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
ſince God did not beſtow
ſo many favours upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
as hee did upon man. But if
wee conſider both theſe natures
of themſelves, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to grace, many, or almoſt
all will ſay, that the Angell is
more perfect then man. In the
deciding of which queſtion, I
cannot reſolve my ſelfe, but with
a diſtinction: Noting firſt, that
in man there are two things
to be conſidered, the Soule and
<pb facs="tcp:57128:37"/>
the body. Of the ſoule ſome ſay,
that it is of the ſame ſubſtance &amp;
nature as the Angels are, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall
and rationall as they;
but that is not a compleat ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
(as Logicians call it)
wherein it only differs from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p>Others ingulfing themſelves
into an abyſſe of Metaphyſickes,
ſay, that the Angell is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
then the ſoule, ſince he is not
ſubject to the imperfections and
miſeries of the ſoule, and hath
his will, not indifferent to good
or evill as the ſoule hath, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
frame himſelfe to doe that
which is good and juſt. Which
reaſon I cannot allow of: For
conſidering the Angell accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his owne nature, or in <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
naturalibus,</hi> as Divines tearme
<pb facs="tcp:57128:38"/>
it, he is as indifferent to good or
evill, as the rationall ſoule; which
is evidently proved by holy
Scripture, which ſaith, that <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>
and all his followers did ſinke
themſelves into hell, and <hi>Michael</hi>
and other good Angels remained
in Paradiſe. For if the Angell
by nature had been impeccable,
and could not have ſinned, hee
could not have damned himſelf,
nor much leſſe ſave himſelfe, if
his will even from the inſtance
of his creation had beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
determined to evill.
Beſides the Scripture telleth us
that there be good and bad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and that the laſt fell from
Heaven for the ſinne of pride:
whereby is concluded, that the
nature of Angels preciſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
is peccable, and may
<pb facs="tcp:57128:38"/>
ſinne, being indifferent to good
or evill, as well as the ſoule. Yet
the Angel being now confirmed
in grace, loſes the indifferency
which he had, and his will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
now governed and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
onely to good. And all this
may the Divine finde to bee
likewiſe in the ſoule punctually:
there being none ſo fooliſh as to
imagine that in the bleſſed there
is any indifferency or poſſibility
of ſinning. So that by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
reaſon it is not concluded
that the Angell is more perfect
than the ſoule.</p>
               <p>And if the curious perſon will
give me leave to ſpeake my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
freely, in this caſe I will ſay
(alwayes ſubjecting my ſelfe to
the doctrine of the Fathers, and
correction of the Church) that
<pb facs="tcp:57128:39"/>
the ſoule in this world, even with
its indifferency of ſinning or not
ſinning, is more perfect then the
Angell, though he neither doth
nor can ſin. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſoule having the power
to ſin and not ſinning, gaines a
greater excellency and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then ſhee ſhould otherwiſe
have, if ſhe were good becauſe
ſhe could not be bad, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
is: So that the indifferency
which is in the ſoule, and her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſubject to ſo many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which daily fight againſt it,
argues an excellency of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
whereby making her victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
more glorious over her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
her reward ſhal be ſo much
the greater. For I would faine
know what great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is it for a man to be quiet and
<pb facs="tcp:57128:39"/>
peaceable, when there is no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſtrives againſt him? Or what
is it for one to be good, when
there is no body to provoke or
entice him to bee evill? And
what perfection ſhall it be not to
ſin, when the will is ſo tyed and
ſubjected as that it cannot ſinne?
None verily: Whereby I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the ſoule even in her
owne nature is more noble than
the Angels. True it is, that if we
will conſider in Angels that
which is acceſſory, and conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitates
this their unaptneſſe to
ſin, which is glory, and the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall
viſion, in this he ſhall bee
more perfect than the ſoule, and
there ſhall be as much difference
betweene them, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
him that is bleſſed, and
him that is not: whereof I intend
<pb facs="tcp:57128:40"/>
not now to diſcourſe. But if we
will conſider the counterpriſes
and inconveniences whereunto
the ſoule is ſubject whilſt it lives
within this mortal body, (I mean
the dependency it hath upon the
ſenſes in all her operations) then
queſtionleſſe the Angel being
incorporeall, and without any
dependency, is more perfect
then it. Yet otherwiſe the ſoule
exceeds all other creatures in
nobleneſſe, amongſt which ſhee
onely participates ſomewhat of
God.</p>
               <p>Of this nobleneſſe of man in
reſpect of other creatures, I doe
not purpoſe to diſcourſe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the way; it being a thing
which requires much metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
and ſpeculation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
laying it aſide, we wil treate
<pb facs="tcp:57128:40"/>
of that, which it hath in reſpect
of its owne individui, that is
one man, in reſpect of another:
ſeeking wherein conſiſts the
nobleneſſe of man: that is to ſay,
who amongſt men may juſtly
call himſelfe noble, and what
requiſites he ought to have, that
deſerves ſuch a title, and name.
I am moved to ſpeake of this by
reaſon of the conceit every one
hath of himſelfe, of what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
ſoever he be, eſteeming
himſelfe noble, and well borne.
And this evill is growne ſo
common, that if you aske a Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
an accoumpt of his genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
and diſcent, he ſhall puffe
up like a Peacock, anſwer you,
that he is deſcended by a direct
line, from the Emperour <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
or <hi>Alexander</hi> the great:
<pb facs="tcp:57128:41"/>
and he will ſpeake it with ſuch
confidence, and oſtentation,
that even he ſhall bee bound to
beleeve him, that knows it to be
falſe. I will not ſay, that Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is repugnant to a mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
artificer, nor to him that
lives by his hand labour; Yea I
hold them to be in a great error
who ordinarily ſtile country
men and thoſe people who live
by their labours, to be peaſants,
and baſe people, baniſhing them
out of the number, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the noble, by reaſon of
their vocation. Since it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that the nobleſt of all men
that ever were, was <hi>Adam,</hi> and
he had no other quality, nor
trade but a labourer: being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to eate his bread with the
ſweat of his brow. The ſonnes
<pb facs="tcp:57128:41"/>
of <hi>Adam</hi> were noble, and they
exerciſed themſelves onely in
mechanick and baſe trades: as
as to bee Smiths, and the like.
<hi>Noah</hi> was by all men held to be
noble, yet his recreations were
nothing, but planting of vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,
and ſowing of fields. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
and his children were
noble, ſeeing that from them
came the Jewiſh nobility, yet
had they no other meanes to
live, but what they got by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring:
<hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> were
noble, and Kings, yet were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſheapeards. Finally, all
the ancient nobility was occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in bare and mechanicall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes:
wherby I conclude, that
they are deceived who judge of
nobility by their exerciſes and
trades. Neither doth true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb facs="tcp:57128:42"/>
conſiſt, in being private,
or in favour with Kings: ſince
there are many who not onely
are out of favour with Kings, but
alſo are perſecuted by them; yet
their nobility, ſtands ſtill firme,
alive, and ſecure. Neither doth
it conſiſt in learning; ſince that
ordinarily the moſt learned, and
wiſe, if they have nothing elſe
but learning, are the moſt vile,
and contemned of a common
wealth. Whence I draw this
concluſion, that true nobility
conſiſts in every ones generous
actions, be he rich, or poore,
Cittizen, ignorant, or learned. So
that he may lawfully be called
noble; who ſhall be moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for ſome heroicall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
either of fidelity, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or any other rare vertue.
<pb facs="tcp:57128:42"/>
And it is reaſonable and juſt that
ſuch a ones memory ſhould bee
preſerved in his poſterity, all of
his linage holding the name of
Noble.</p>
               <p>This is the true nobility which
is called diſcreet and wiſe mens
nobility; becauſe thoſe that are
ſo, ought to hold or eſteem none
but ſuch to bee noble: But the
vulgars nobility, which this day
is practiſed in the world, is not
this, but wealth; ſo that in this
our wretched age, hee is onely
eſteemed noble, that is rich. And
if the diſcreet and wiſe reader
will give mee leave to prove the
nobleneſſe of wealth by the
baſeneſſe of the contrary, which
is poverty, hee ſhall clearly ſee,
that the vulgar ſort are not much
deceived therein, ſince there is no
<pb facs="tcp:57128:43"/>
miſ-hap nor miſery can be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to a poore mans. Poverty is
the quinteſſence of contempt,
the root of all worldly miſeries,
and the grave of vertue. Give
mee the valianteſt and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſeſt
man in the world, if he be
poore, a Hare ſhall not bee more
timorous or cowardly then hee.
If hee bee honeſt and mannerly,
there is none, but ſeeing him
poore, will eſteeme him an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.
And finally, povertie
comming to any mans doore, the
world knowes him not: his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
denies him, his friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
from him, his ſervants for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him, and hee ſeemes a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to all, the world flying from
him, as if hee had the plague a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him. Poverty is the mother
of Infamy: for finding a man
<pb facs="tcp:57128:43"/>
poore, hee will bee apt to worke
any deceit or roguery, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any treachery: his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
companions being diſhonour,
cruelty, ignorance, contempt,
falſhood, infidelity, treacherie;
which, and the like, a poore man
ſhall bee apt to commit. What
difference is there betweene a
poore man and a withered tree, a
bow without a ſtring, a ſhip
without tackling, a cart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wheeles, a bird without
wings, or a body without a
ſoule? Surely not any: Since
hee remaines as unable to doe
any good thing, as the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
things. Since therefore
theſe are the effects which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
produces in man, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good reaſon the vulgar ſort
affirme, that nobility conſiſts in
<pb facs="tcp:57128:44"/>
the want of nothing. And what
doth man deſire more, then with
nobility to enjoy thoſe priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which wealth bringeth with
it: For let a man be the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
fellow under the Sunne;
yea, let him be a hangman, if hee
be a rich man, and in proſperity,
he ſhall ſtraightwayes be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier,
Noble, and well deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the line of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great, and the firſt of the
<hi>Baldwins:</hi> Let him never have
taken ſword in hand, nor ſeene
battle, unleſſe it were drawne in
ſome picture; and they ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſay, that hee is a valiant
Captaine, and that in the Gulfe
of <hi>Lepanto</hi> hee overcame the
Turkiſh Armie, and tooke the
King of <hi>Miramamolin</hi> priſoner.
Let him not know the firſt letter
<pb facs="tcp:57128:44"/>
of the A. B. C. and they ſhall
ſuddenly canonize him for a
<hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus.</hi> Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
being rich, he ſhall in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars
eye, have all the vertues, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences,
and nobleneſſe in the
world: for all will reſpect and
reverence him, pulling off their
hats to him a mile off. If hee
comes into the Church, they
will all make way for him, and
give him their places. At ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
they place him at the upper
end of the table; when he ſpeaks,
they all ſtand attentive, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to him, as if a <hi>Cicero</hi> were
ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>The rich mans houſe is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
by all men, his children
are made much of, his ſervants
are reſpected, and ſtiled gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
if he be ſicke, the City is
<pb facs="tcp:57128:45"/>
turned upſide downe to find out
preſents to bring him; his gate
ſtands full of foot-clothes, his
hall full of viſiters, his tables at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
on with muſicke; and in
concluſion, as all manner of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
accompany the poore man,
ſo all contents, favours, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
belong to the rich, ſince
in this wretched age money is
the abſolute Lord over all our
actions. This commands, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes,
and keepes in ſubjection
all the world, and all things, as
<hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, obey it. It attaines
to all things, makes all things ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
Money is the object, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and end of all mans cares
and deſires; towards it are bent
all his endeavours and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and every thing is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by it. This makes the bitter
<pb facs="tcp:57128:45"/>
ſweet, the impoſſible eaſie, the
little great, the falſe true, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
of nothing it makes all
things; and by reaſon of its great
power and worth, all the world
loves it, ſeekes it, and adores it,
tormenting and even martyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
themſelves for to obtaine it.
What moves the Souldier to
march up to the knees in water
in the winter time, loaden with
iron, nigh dead with hunger and
thirſt, broken and bruiſed all in
peeces, with death daily before
his eyes, but only money? what
makes the Labourer to break his
armes, yea his whole body, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up the earth with his labors,
but onely money? What makes
the mechanicall artificer paſſe
continually the winter nights in
working, but onely money?
<pb facs="tcp:57128:46"/>
Who makes the Merchant ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
his life upon two inches of
planck, and ſuffer ſo many ſtorms
and tempeſts, but onely money?
Who makes the Lawyer loſe his
ſight in ſtudying <hi>Bartolus</hi> and
<hi>Baldus,</hi> the Phyſician <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
and <hi>Galen,</hi> but onely money?
Who makes the Councellour
confound his braines to defend
his cauſes <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> but
onely money? In concluſion,
money is the end towards which
man directs all his actions and
endeavours. The Phyſicians
<hi>Recipe,</hi> the Apothecaries <hi>miſce,</hi>
the Lawyers <hi>Bartolus,</hi> the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veners
Pen, the Notaries &amp;c. the
Logicians <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
Nominatives, the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians
Heaven, the Philoſophers
<hi>infinitum,</hi> the Metaphyficians
<pb facs="tcp:57128:46"/>
                  <hi>unum verum &amp; bonum,</hi> the Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
Nawle, the Taylors
Needle, the Plowmans Plough,
the Noblemans Gentility; and
finally, life and death it ſelfe lies
in the hands of money: ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is able to condemne a juſt
man to death, and to give life to
one that is condemned to dye.
Whence finally I conclude, that
the vulgar ſort ſpeakes not much
out of purpoſe, when it attributes
all the nobleneſſe of the world
unto money, ſince in the world
infinite wonders are wrought
by it.</p>

which my pen could not in an

conſiſts in the generoſity of

of theſe two Nations are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
ſo excellent, and ſo heroicall,
that it would bee impoſſible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

leaſt part of them. I will not
<pb facs="tcp:57128:47"/>
now ſtand to ſet downe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and deſcent of theſe two
moſt noble Nations, it being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
unto all, and ordinary for
them who have written of this
matter. I will only inſiſt a little
upon the contemplation of the
rare and perfect vertues which
God infuſed into them: of which
he may come to have knowledge
and notice, who will attentively
conſider the marvellous order
which God held in the ſix daies
of his Creation, in which time
he had beautified the large field
of this world with ſo many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties
of nature; and that they
might make ſhew of the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which hee had granted
them, hee made the fourth day
two faire and bright lights, to
which hee gave certaine vicars
<pb facs="tcp:57128:48"/>
and ſubſtitutes, giving them full
licence to aſſiſt the day and night,
dividing, ordering, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
times and ſeaſons, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
thoſe marvellous effects
which daily experience preſents
unto us in the theatre of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

perfection of theſe two Lights
might ſufficiently be proved by
the onely knowledge of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
ſince he muſt be altogether
blinde, that opening his ſight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heaven, doth not know,
that the Sunne and Moone are
authors of all the rejoycings and
gladneſſes of this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of
all the varieties, changes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
that are ſeene in the
foure elements: and that their
abſence cauſeth many troubles

<pb facs="tcp:57128:48"/>
which the horror of the night,
and nightly impreſſions may
teſtifie by the ſunnes abſence,
together with an infinite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of other effects, which for
brevity ſake, I do omit. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the ſtrongeſt meanes I
have to prove the excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of theſe two lights, is to
ſee that the Prophets, and the
whole Scripture, when they
would make us conceive the
greatneſſe of the Creator, they
know not to whom better to
compare him, then to theſe, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him Sunne, and Moone,

ſplendor from them, and that
from them proceed all the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations,

that hath, or hath not life.</p>
               <p>Theſe and infinite other
greatneſſes, ſhall the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
man find in theſe two great
lights which God placed in the
celeſtiall globe, ſo noble, faire,
and bright, that an acute under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
can not ſufficiently
praiſe them, but onely by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
them. For if thoſe doe
enlighten all viſible and materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
thinges; theſe doe enrich,
and governe the reaſon, and the
actions of the will, which are ſo
much above the ſenſitive, as the
being free, and voluntary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the naturall, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
Theſe have for their ends
generation, corruption, variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and change; theſe to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize,
to conſerve, and alſo to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

<pb facs="tcp:57128:49"/>
doe produce marveilous effects,
as vertue, counſell, underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
learning, and doctrine,
which eternize the ſoule with

that the middle, or meanes, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

the heavenly lights with
all their influences, and vertues,
being onely created for man, it

               <p>Yet we will compare the

the magnanimity of his bright
influences, that the wiſe may
conjecture the beauty of the
whole, by the beauty of the
parts. Let the Earth eternize thy
renown, ſince the Heavens, as an
elect veſſell of perfection, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
ſingular favours upon thee,
beautifying thee with all thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:57128:52"/>
conditions and requiſites which
belong to a juſt and lawful King.
And if one (as the Scripture
ſaith) would have excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from being King, ſaying that
he was no Phyſitian, neither was
there bread in his houſe: that
cannot bee ſpoken of thee, who
art abundance it ſelfe, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheſt
other nations with bread,
wealth, nobility, infinite valour,
vertue, knowledge, mercy and
piety. And to this plenty is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thy being a Phyſitian, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
thou doeſt arrive to the <hi>non
plus ultra</hi> of thy greatneſſe; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
upon earth the mirrour
of Chriſtians, the ſcourge of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
the fire of thine enemies,
the death of the envious, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the paſſionate, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

<pb facs="tcp:57128:53"/>
of thy orphans, the juſtice of thy
wronged.</p>
               <p>None can tax thee, unleſſe it
be ſome one, who burſts with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
or rages with paſſion. When
did ever the poore, wretched,
or needy come to thy doore, to
aske for ſuccour; but that thou
diddeſt with a free and liberall
hand, remedie their neceſſities?
when did the afflicted, ever lay
open his griefes, and ſorrowes,
unto thee; but that he found
thee alwaies diſpoſed like a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
mother to yeeld her a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
when ever did oppreſſion,
wrong, or ſubordination dwell
within thy breaſt? was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any affect found in thee, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thy children other then
clemency, liberality, generoſity,
and vertue? can there be ought
<pb facs="tcp:57128:53"/>
found in thee to obſcure the
leaſt atome of the perfect ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors?
No ſurely, thou art the
quinteſſence of greatneſſe, and
valour, thou art the <hi>Infinitum in
actu</hi> of worth. Finally, thou art
the content and harmony of
this our hemiſphere.</p>
               <p>The laſt attribute belonging
to theſe lamps of heaven, which
is to cauſe changes, alter the
times, and produce divers ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
belongs alſo to this nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may eaſily be proved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpending many wordes, by
the quotidian experiences, and
marveilous effects, which her
glorious enterpriſes doe worke
amongſt all nations; ſince that
every time as France takes arms
in hand, other nations preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
confuſed, and changed, and
<pb facs="tcp:57128:54"/>
with a deadly heart beating
double their garriſons, fortifie
their wals, renew their muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
give orders, and prepare
themſelves with ſuch care for
defence, as if they looked for a
new deluge in the world. The
fierce roaring of the Lion in the
night, doth not more affright the
other beaſts of the wood, then
the ſound of the French trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
or drumme, affrighteth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kingdomes: what light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
broke out of a cloud,
comes downe whirling more
furiouſly through the aire, then
the fearleſſe, and warlike French
doth in ſetting upon an enemies
campe? what Kingdome, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Province, is upon the
earth, that having France on his
part, hath not Mars in his armes,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:54"/>
a Lion in his breaſt, an Eagle in
his handes, a crowne on his
head, and an aſſured victory on
his ſide? are the treaties, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plots,
expeditions, and underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
of other nations, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and ſtrong enough, if French
valour doth not aide, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
them? No ſurely, ſince we
ſee that as the ſunne beames doe
diſſolve the Chaos, and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the clouds; even ſo the
French ſtrength, and induſtry,
once beginning to ſhew it ſelfe,
breakes, ſplittes, and annihilates,
the plots, and ſtratagems of all
other nations: ſo that they doe if
this will, they have if this
gives, they get if this ſuffer, they
conquer if this helpes, they loſe
if this go from them and finally,
if this perſecutes, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:55"/>
I could ſay much more, though
it would all be too little, if feare
of being tedious, did not ſtay my
tongue, and the diſcretion which
a writer ought to ſuppoſe in
the reader did not ſecure me, as
alſo the infinite diſproportion,
which is betwixt the groſſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergie
of my tongue, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
valor of this nation. So
all that which I have ſaid, and
all that which Rethoricke could
ſet downe, if ſhe did undertake
the taske, would be but a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of an infinite, an atome of
an immenſity, a point of a line,
an inſtant of eternity, a ſhadow
which paſſeth, and like a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in reſpect of the whole.
And ſince the ſubject of my
Booke will not ſuffer me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
any thing of this noble na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:55"/>
I ſhall be forced to imitate
the induſtry of that famous pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who being commanded to
draw out a Giant in a little ſpace,
finding that it was impoſſible to
draw him out whole, he reſolved
to draw onely one of his little
nayles, ſo as by that proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
might be knowne the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
and greatneſſe of the
Giant. Let thoſe therfore which
reade this Chapter know, that if
I have ſaid any thing that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
too much to any one, that all
this is but the leaſt part of the
whole, which might be ſpoken
in praiſe of this Nation.</p>

I have with ſilence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

for the moſt ungratefull,

that againſt the naturall

Ceſar his due from him. On
the other ſide, me thinks I meet

that which I have ſpoken
to bee <hi>proprium quarto modo</hi> (as
your Logicians terme it) belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
onely to them and not to
others. I alſo know that ſome
malicious Sophiſter, enflamed
with paſſion, ſtands waiting with
great impatience to ſee whether
I will expreſſe my ſelfe, and tell
which of the two Nations is the
Sunne, and which is the Moone,
which ſhall have the title of the
greater, and which of the leſſer
Light.</p>
               <p>But my intention being not to
kindle the fire of enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
theſe two Nations, but
rather to quench that which is,
and onely to treat of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb facs="tcp:57128:57"/>
and nobleneſſe of each of
them, without offending either
of them: I ſay (ſhunning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons,
which are odious) that
betweene theſe two moſt noble
Nations there is neither greater
nor leſſer, great nor little, ſince
they are both great Lights, faire,
and reſplendant. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all that I have ſpoken of the
French Nation, muſt alſo be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of the Spaniſh, without
diminiſhing any the leaſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as may be thought of.</p>
               <p>And to ſhew the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
which theſe two nations
have with the two Lights of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
upon which I have groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
my diſcourſe, it ſhall ſuffice
that the holy Scripture ſaith, that
God created two great Lights,
without ſeeking out any other
<pb facs="tcp:57128:57"/>
particulars, or Metaphyſicall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions.
Yet to ſatisfie the
malcontent, and thoſe which are
too curious, who will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
till they know which of
theſe two Nations is the Sunne,
and which the Moone; which
governes by day, and which by
night, I ſhall be forced to ſhew
a point of Philoſophy, by which
your delicate and appaſſionate
underſtanding ſhall be ſatisfied,
and ſhall confeſſe that there is
neither greater nor leſſer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe two noble Nations,
being both great, and of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
worth and dignity.</p>
               <p>Your Schollers know that the
whole Homogeneon, or alike, is
of ſuch nature and property, that
the integrant parts of it have the
ſame faculty, name, and being
<pb facs="tcp:57128:58"/>
which the whole hath. As for
example, water which ſtands in
many veſſels, bee they great or
ſmall, ſtill all or each of the parts
retaines the ſame name and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of water, there being no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
that can bee imagined
which doth not equally befit all
the parts. In the ſame manner
we ſhall ſee that the light being
a homogeneall and like quality,
all the parts of it, though placed
in ſeveral ſubjects, have the ſame
nature, name, and vertue. And
therefore it would be a great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
to imagine the light of
the Sunne to be different, or of
any other quality then the light
of the Moone, ſince God made
them both the fourth day, ſhining
with the ſame light which hee
had created the firſt day. Which
<pb facs="tcp:57128:58"/>
may admirably bee proved by
thoſe words of the Pſalm, which
ſay, <hi>Per diem Sol non uret te, neque
Luna per noctem,</hi> giving us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that the vertue of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is in the ſame manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both, as well as the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the having its influences,
and the lighting. And in that
ſenſe muſt thoſe words of <hi>Moſes</hi>
be underſtood, <hi>Fecit Deus duo
luminaria magna.</hi> There are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
three things to bee
conſidered in each one of theſe
lights, the influence, the manner,
and the light. The two firſt are
different enough, the Moone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her courſe in eight and
twenty dayes and odde houres,
and the Sunne in a yeare, and
therefore there muſt needs bee
ſome difference in them, and
<pb facs="tcp:57128:59"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:59"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:60"/>
therefore holy Scripture calleth
the one the greater light, and the
other the leſſer; but as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the light, they are both
great, and ſhining. The ſame
Philoſophy may be found in our
two earthly lights, I meane in the
French and Spaniſh Nations, to
whom God did impart worth,
perfection, and nobleneſſe, with
ſuch liberality, that he left them
great, and wholly perfect, noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and vertue being as proper
to either of them, as the light is
to the Sunne and the Moone.
The truth is, that in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
there may be ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and may likewiſe by turns
bee called one greater then the
other, no otherwiſe then the
Philoſophers affirm the heavens
to be more perfect then man, by
<pb facs="tcp:57128:60"/>
reaſon of his incorruptibility, but
as being a living creature, not
onely man, but even the leaſt
worme of the earth is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
In the ſame manner ſome
things may bee found in the
French Nation which may cauſe
it to be called the greater, and ſo
likewiſe the Spaniſh may have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which may give it the ſame
name and title. Yet theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
being accidentall, doe not
undo the greatneſſe of the other,
agreeing both in the eſſentiall
perfection, of being both moſt
noble and advantaged. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all that which hath beene
ſpoken of France, &amp; much more
which might have beene ſpoken,
may without diminiſhing of the
leaſt tittle bee alſo ſpoken of
Spaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:61"/>
And if that the enmity and
naturall antipathy, rooted in the
hearts of theſe two Nations, for
ſo many ages, ſhall dazle the eies
of ſome paſſionate, and will not
ſuffer him to know the reaſon, I
wil ſatisfie him with experience,
the true mother to give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and faithful witneſſe of truth,
by ſetting downe ſome little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of that moſt pure &amp; unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
brightneſſe which this great
light communicates to all the
world, to bring forth in it thoſe
vertues and marvellous effects
which are in it. Of whoſe unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
ſtrength, the Eagles and
the Lion, which great <hi>Philip</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
in all his devices, ſhall bee
witneſſes, giving us thereby to
underſtand, that his command,
worth and ſtrength, flies through
<pb facs="tcp:57128:61"/>
all parts of the world, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no part within its ſpacious
map, wherein his light, feare,
ſigniorie and nobleneſſe is not
knowne.</p>
               <p>A thouſand times have I had
in remembrance thoſe words of
David, who ſaith: <hi>In omnem ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
exivit ſonus corum, &amp; in fines
orbis terrae verba corum,</hi> which
though they bee conſtrued by
the Doctors, for the Apoſtles,
and preaching of the Goſpell,
yet I may bee ſuffered to apply
them to the ſingular vertue of
this noble Nation, they ſeeming
to bee ſpoken onely to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for if we attentively hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the cries which are heard
in all the parts of the world, there
is nothing heard but <hi>Viva Spain</hi>
and <hi>Viva Philip.</hi> If you ask Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
<pb facs="tcp:57128:62"/>
who is her father, ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
refuge, tower &amp; ſtrength,
and who keepes in awe a many
of young Lions, Wolves, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and Foxes that would bite
him, it will ſurely bee anſwered,
that it is none but this couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Lion. If wee come into Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke,
wee ſhall heare nothing
but a terrible and timorous ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of warre, accompanied
with a ſquadron of confuſed and
untuned voyces, which in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight
of them, call for mercy,
and cry, <hi>Viva Spaine.</hi> If we turn
our hearing towards fruitfull A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,
we ſhall heare it doe nothing
but lament the continuall ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which the Spaniſh policie
and valour makes there. And if
we aske newes of this great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in America, it will anſwer
<pb facs="tcp:57128:62"/>
with lowd voyces, that ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
unto it for the light of
the Goſpell, and Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and for taking of it out of
the Divels hands: and finally, for
making of it a new world. And
if curioſity do draw us to inform
our ſelves of what is ſpoken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the briniſh and wide ſeas,
queſtionleſſe we ſhall heare, that
Spaine enriches her Iſlands, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
her gulfes, and makes the
paſſage eaſie to all nations. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the claws, ſtrength and valour
of this great Lion, reach to the
ends of the world, ſince that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica
obeyes is, Affrick feares
it, Aſia deſires it, and Europe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
it.</p>
               <p>And as wee have ſaid above,
that it is proper to the heavenly
lights, to order times, divide ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:63"/>
and enrich the world with
divers effects, to whom can this
better be attributed, then to this
valiant Nation, whoſe noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
wiſedome and quickneſſe
of wit is ſuch, that it ſpecifies
each ſpeculative underſtanding?
Since that all nations, even her
greateſt enemies, confeſſe, that
Spaine is a harbour of vertue, a
treaſure of underſtanding, a ſea
of diſcretion, a garden of noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
an abyſſe of ſciences, and
a wonder of the world. And
fear of not ending my diſcourſe,
I ſhould once engulfe my ſelfe
into the heroicall attempts, and
noted actions by the Spaniards,
did not hinder me, it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
that thoſe of <hi>Mars</hi> would
be abaſed by theirs; and all thoſe
which have been written of
<pb facs="tcp:57128:63"/>
from the creation of the world
to this day, compared with
theirs, would be but as a ſhadow
of the body, and a draught of
the originall, there being no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
obedience, reſpect, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity,
wiſedome and prudence
in the world, which compared
with the brightneſſe and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of this light, bee not darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
ecclipſed, and do not vaniſh
away.</p>
               <p>And if any one judging mee
to be ſuſpect through being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
and partiall, ſhall diſallow
of theſe my reaſons, let him take
the depoſitions of her very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as eye-witneſſes, and hee
ſhall ſee, that there never lodged
feare or puſillanimity in the

               <p>I finally conclude the praiſes

to theſe two nations,
which as the beginning, and
modell of the reſt, muſt have
ſome contrariety, in their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
humours, faſhions, of
cloathing, converſations and the
like, that other nations which
looke on theſe in a glaſſe, might
be various, and ſo humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by reaſon of the ſaid varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſhould be beautified, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull.</p>
               <p>And though this truth be
cleare to any one that ſhall looke
on it; yet I will confirme it by
<hi>Ariſtotles</hi> authority, who ſaith,
that beginnings ought to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
ſaying when he defineth
them, that contraries or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
are they, which are not
made by any, neither any of
<pb facs="tcp:57128:67"/>
them is compoſed of the other,
but of them all things are made;
which definition ſquares excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
well with theſe two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
ſince we cannot ſay, that
they are compoſed of any other;
that is that they have taken any
perfection, vertue or nobleneſſe,
from them which were before
them; ſeeing it is plaine that
ſince the creation of the world,
there never was any nation flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
in learning, wit, ſubtilty,
policie, or other laudable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
more then theſe two. And
ſo it ſeemes that God did with
particuler providence make
them in this world, beſtowing
on them immediately with his
owne hand, thoſe perfections
which they have. Neither can
it be ſaid, that the one is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:57128:68"/>
of the other, ſince that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
France takes anything from
Spaine, nor any way ſeeks to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
it, nor Spaine likewiſe from
France: yet other nations are
compoſed of them, receiving all
the good they have, from theſe
two beginnings, and fruitfull
ſprings, ſo that it agreeing ſo
well, with theſe two nations to
be beginnings, they ought alſo
to be of their nature, that is to
be contrary.</p>
               <p>I hold it certaine, that this
variety and oppoſition of nature,
which is in theſe two nations,
was by divine providence. For
if all were of one minde, and
one humour, either all would
ſtay at home, and would have
no deſire to ſee the world, or all
would be wandring, and forget
<pb facs="tcp:57128:68"/>
their homes, and families, againſt
the law of nature, &amp; preſervation
of humane kinde: and the effects
of the world not have that beauty
which is in them, if they were
all alike. And therefore this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the pretended, and in the
creation of the univerſe, God
made theſe two beginnings, and
nations ſo contrary, and ſhared
all favours, and graces, amongſt
them ſo equally, that the one
cannot prevaile againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
like two contraries of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
vertue; that cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one the other.</p>
               <p>Neither let any one deceive
himſelfe ſo farre as to thinke
that the contrariety which is in
theſe two nations as originalls,
be any imperfection, but that it
is in them the greateſt excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb facs="tcp:57128:69"/>
that may be, ſeeing that
if we conſider it well, they
have no other end, then peace,
and preſervation, it being a thing
infallible that ſince they cannot
overcome, nor conquer one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
by reaſon of the equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſtrength, and valour, they
will preſerve not onely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but theſe nations alſo
which depend on them. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moſt certaine that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
favoured, and protected,
by Spaine, ſhall not be deſtroied
by France: nor likewiſe by
Spaine, any nation favoured by
the French. And therefore wee
ſhall finde that this contrariety is
ordained for the peace, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the world: and if
God had not made theſe two
originall, theſe two nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:69"/>
and communicated unto
them their valour, with full e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,
I verily beleeve that a
great part of the world would
be left: for if God had not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pred
the fury, and violence of
the French, with farre degrees
leſſe of Spaniſh patience, and
ſolidity, they would queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
be ſoveraigns of the world.
And contrariewiſe if Spaniſh
patience were not mixed, with a
ſlow, and flegmatick delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
there is no doubt but
they would bring all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the earth in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And that therefore God,
who with an equall ballance,
meaſure and wiſedome made all
thinges, ſweetly diſpoſing of
them, ordained that the world
ſhould be preſerved in peace by
<pb facs="tcp:57128:70"/>
meanes of this contrariety, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the goods ſo equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
theſe two Nations, that
that which the one wanted, the
other abounded in, that ſo like
two perfect originals they might
give peace and preſervation unto
other Nations.</p>
               <p>This Philoſophy wil not ſeem
harſh to them who ſhall conſider
in the foure Elements the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
and order wherewith
they mix themſelves, to produce
and preſerve thoſe things which
are compoſed of them; for hee
ſhall in them finde their qualities
tempered and divided with ſuch
art, that the one hath that which
the other wants. God gave the
Element of fire heat (as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
call it) <hi>in ſummo,</hi> and
drineſſe <hi>inremiſſo.</hi> For if it were
<pb facs="tcp:57128:70"/>
extreame, as the heat, it would
with its power and activity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
all the other. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to withſtand that diſorder,
he left the fire with a remiſneſſe.
If the earth had coldneſſe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame,
as it hath dryneſſe, it
would by reaſon of its clammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
&amp; hardneſſe be intractable,
and altogether incapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
any mixt. He left the
water with a remiſſe humidity,
giving the ſame to the ayre <hi>in
ſummo.</hi> So that with this diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of qualities, God made
them originals of peace and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.
The ſame art did hee
uſe in theſe two Nations: for he
gave the French the extreame of
valour, force, and gentileneſſe,
yet accompanyed with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
of variability and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:71"/>
He placed in the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
courage, ſtability, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
in a ſupreame degree, but
tempered with a remiſſe delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
I would lay open the
point more diffuſedly, if I did not
feare thereby to animate, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the truth, the two nations
one againſt the other, who will
not confeſſe that they have any
thing in a remiſſe degree, but all
perfection <hi>in ſummo.</hi> And ſo we
are to beleeve that it was by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ordained that gifts ſhould be
ſo entermingled betweene theſe
two Nations, that neither France
nor Spaine ſhould have all the
power in either of themſelves,
but equally divided betweene
them, that knowing themſelves
to be no ſtronger one then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they ſhould alwayes live in
<pb facs="tcp:57128:71"/>
peace, and ſhould not attempt any
thing whereby they might get
broken heads. The truth of this
admirable peece of worke was
rarely ſet downe unto us in two
words by the wiſe man, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the fabrick and ordering
of the world, and the wonderfull
meanes which God ordained to
preſerve it, ſaid that hee had ſet
one againſt one. Which was
queſtionleſſe done, becauſe no
one ſhould overtop the other, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beyond his bounds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines.
And ſo conſidering well
the whole frame of the world,
we ſhall finde that there is no one
kinde or nature in it, but hath its
contrary. God having ſet againſt
a hell, heaven; againſt a <hi>Lucifer,
Michael;</hi> againſt vice, vertue;
againſt an <hi>Adam, Chriſt;</hi> againſt
<pb facs="tcp:57128:72"/>
an <hi>Eve,</hi> a <hi>Mary;</hi> againſt the fire,
water; and finally, againſt the
Spaniſh the French nation, from
which two, as from beginnings,
yet contraries, ſhould iſſue ſuch
plentifull ſtreames of valour, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity,
&amp; nobleneſſe, as ſhould
beautifie and make fruitfull all
mankinde; ſince that if any light
of faith hath ſpread it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
infidels, it hath beene
through the diligence and labour
of theſe two moſt noble Lights.</p>

and Chriſtian religion to ſpring
up in all Heathen countreyes, and
by that meanes get them from
under his ſubjection, whom by
meanes of idolatry and beſtiality
wherewith he deceived them, he
yet kept: hee gathered ſtrength
out of their weaknes, and ſought
to hinder this fruit, making uſe
of the powerfulleſt arms he had,
which were enmity and hatred:
which hee rooted ſo deeply in
theſe two Nations, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
his art into a nature, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them enmity and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of one another as heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
there being no ſigne or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
left of amitie, peace and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt them; ſo that the
ſmoke and duſt, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>
ſaith in the Revelation, that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:57128:73"/>
ſtarre fell from heaven, hath
raiſed, is gotten up to the fourth
ſpheare, and darkened the Sun.
This is the cloud of enmity and
mortall hatred, which the Divell
ſowed between the Spaniſh and
the French, which obſcured the
Sunne and light of theſe two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Since, if had not been this
curſed ſeed of enmity, whence
groweth the diſtruſt of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
They had, being both uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together, conquered moſt
Kingdomes and Monarchies of
the world, diſſipating the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of infidelity in many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
and kingdomes which
want the light of the Goſpell,
and had offered an acceptable
ſacrifice to God, of an infinite
number of ſoules, which they
would have drawne out of the
<pb facs="tcp:57128:74"/>
way of perdition, and brought
them into the way of ſalvation
and eternall life.</p>
               <p>It is therefore lamentable to
ſee, that this accurſed Leviathan
ſhould finde ſo much aptneſſe in
ſuch wiſe nations, to ſwallow his
mortall poyſon, and bring them
from their firſt perfection, that
hee could bee contented to ſet
them at variance, and in hatred;
but hee hath alſo with his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
diligence converted them
(at leaſt in outward ſhew) into
himſelfe: ſeeing that although a
Frenchman be the ſame with the
Spaniard, in that which is of the
eſſence, that is rationalitie; yet
hath the Divell ſo diſguiſed this
nature in ſuch ſort, and hath ſo
maliciouſly defiled, and changed
her accidents, humours and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:74"/>
that now a Frenchman
in a Spaniards eye ſeemes to bee
no man; and a Spaniard a Divell
in the Frenchmans eye.</p>
               <p>And if the Divell would have
been contented with ſetting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and diſcord onely in the
humour, cloathing, commerce,
and other particular ceremonies
of theſe two nations, it were no
great matter, for it might eaſily
have been remedied; but he was
ſo cunning in ſowing this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
diſſention, that with his
deadly punctures and poyſon, he
converted that into nature, which
before were but accidents, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it paſſe by ſucceſſion, from
the fathers to the ſonnes, &amp; from
theſe to the grand-children, like
originall ſinne. So that as the
Chicken flieth from, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
<pb facs="tcp:57128:75"/>
of the Kite, although hee
doth not know him: or as the
gentle Lamb ſcarcely come out
of the mothers belly, ſeeing the
Wolfe a great way off, retires
fearfull and timerous, flying him
as a mortall enemy, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeen him before, nor recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
any hurt by him, nor any
having ſhewed him any enmity
and antipathy. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the hatred of the French to
the Spaniards, and the Spaniards
to the French, is growne ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
that even in children hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on their mothers breaſts,
there ſeemes to grow a naturall
inſtinct to know a Spaniard a
mile off, crying out as lowd at the
ſight of him, as if hee did ſee
ſome ſtrange viſion or appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:75"/>
From this naturall antipathy
commeth that to either nation,
the cuſtomes, cloathing, &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of living of the one, ſeemes
evill-favoured, improper, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
abominable to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though the things of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
bee good, joyning them
with the three ordinary fruits of
hatred, which are, unbeliefe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
and contempt. For if
one tell a Frenchman of any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
any ſtrong hold, or citie
which the Spaniard hath taken,
or any other famous &amp; heroicall
enterprizes, which this nation
ordinarily performe, none ſhall
make him beleeve it, no not if an
Angell ſhould come down from
heaven to verifie it. And if he be
either by common report, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
credible relations forced to
<pb facs="tcp:57128:76"/>
beleeve that the thing is true, hee
will ſay, they yeelded without
reſiſtance, or that all in the hold
were aſleep, that the watches and
centries betrayed it, or that there
were but thirty of the enemies
ſouldiers, and the Spaniards were
three thouſand: or finally, that
there were many Frenchmen in
the Spaniſh army, by whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and induſtry the battell was
given, and the victory obtained.
Howſoever, hee will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
that the victory was truly
gotten, but by ſome accident, or
miſchance.</p>
               <p>So againe, if the Spaniard
heare any ſuch like newes of the
French, he will ſay that ſome ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
broke her bankes, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the enemies campe, or that
thirty peeces of ordnance brake
<pb facs="tcp:57128:76"/>
and killed halfe their army, or
that the plague, or ſome other
contagious diſeaſe, was amongſt
them: ſo that he will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that the victory was obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by any ſtrength, valour, or
induſtry, but by meere misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>All the world knowes that
Spaine is more barren then
France, by reaſon of the great
droughts, and ſmall ſtore of
raine, that falls there: wherefore
ſome yeares there comes corne,
and other victualls out of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedock,
and Provence into
Catalonia, and France, come
your hollands, cloth, linnen,
cambrick, and a thouſand other
commodities which Spaine hath
not: yet you ſhall not finde a
Spainard who will confeſſe, that
<pb facs="tcp:57128:77"/>
France is a better land, or more
abundant, and rich. The ſame
weakneſſe we alſo finde in the
French, ſeeing that the greateſt
Prince of that nation, that day as
he will make ſhew of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
he adornes and beautifies
himſelfe with things which
come out of Spaine: if he have
any brave horſe, it is Spaniſh, if
he have perfumes about him
they are Spaniſh, if he be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in fine cloth it is Spaniſh, if
he drinke good wine it is Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
and will ſcorne at play to
carry any money about him but
Spaniſh piſtolets; and yet though
all this be true, they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
but that Spaine is a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
country, and Spaniards a
cunning, malicious, and no way
curious nation. And when they
<pb facs="tcp:57128:77"/>
are convinced by experience,
they will ſay, that all is good in
Spaine which cannot ſpeake.</p>
               <p>All Spaniards hold the French
liberty, mirth, and affability, to
be baſe, contemptible, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,
and of ſmall eſteeme,
and almoſt madneſſe, and yet is
a wonderfull perfection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they excell all other nations;
for by that meanes any one bee
hee never ſo poore, may come
to ſpeake to the King, and relate
his grievances to him when hee
will, without any let. The
French gives like judgement of
the Spaniard, calling his gravity,
and continency, pride, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
yet it ſtandeth with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that every one ſhould know
what he is, and not give occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſuffer too much liberty,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:78"/>
to breed <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ words">
                     <desc>〈◊…〉</desc>
                  </gap> and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards accompt your
French liberality in great feaſts,
and banquets, to be an unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
gluttony; it being very
true as I my ſelfe have ſeene, that
they are very abundant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
in their foode, eſpecially
your Nobility; their ends in
theſe exceſſes beeing no other
then to keepe their houſes, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and families, ſatisfied, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and merry; which are things
properly belonging to generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The French beleeve that to
abſtaine from theſe exceſſes, and
the rule and order which the
Spaniards keepe, proceeds from
baſeneſſe, and avarice, onely to
avoid expence: and yet it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
that this is no vertue, like
<pb facs="tcp:57128:78"/>
unto ſobriety, and parſimony, as
well for the commendation it
particularly hath in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as alſo for the ſpirituall and
bodily benefits, which proceed
from it.</p>
               <p>If you aske a Spaniard what
he thinkes of the French habit,
and fancy, he will not onely
hold them to be ill favoured, but
will be ſcandalized at a thing
which cauſeth mirth, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
the mindes. For to ſee a
troope of French upon a feſtivall
day cloathed in ſuch variety of
colours with a thouſand kinds of
feathers, jewells, embroderies,
fringes, ornaments, and gold la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with ſo many hundred of je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels,
diamonds, pearles, rubies,
emeralds, and topaces, that one
would thinke the Indies were
<pb facs="tcp:57128:79"/>
landed in France; is even as one
ſhould ſee a garden enamelled,
and enterlaced moſt artificially
with divers flowers, or a faire
field full of dazies, lillies, and
violets, whoſe faire ſhew, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
the ſences, keepes the mind
in ſuſpence, and enamoures the
very ſoule: Yet the Spaniard
will ſay, that it is the greateſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the world. I doe not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at it, becauſe that in Spaine
your civill habit is ſo much uſed,
and wearing of colors ſo abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that they force the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to weare colours, for a
marke of his ſhame, and infamy.
And if we have a French mans
judgement concerning your
Spaniſh habit, and manner of
clothing, he will ſay that to goe
alwaies in black is a ſigne of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:79"/>
the marke of a widdow,
or a decayed perſon, yet blacke
is one of the moſt honourable
colours, and argues modeſty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
authority, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>Let a French man truly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the effect of the looke, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
and curteſie of a Spaniard,
his deliberateneſſe in his ſpeech,
his reſervedneſſe, his affectuous
conceipts in his diſcourſes, his
gravity in his gate, his patience
in his buſineſſe, his meaſuring of
his words, his attentive heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to his reaſons who ſpeakes
to him, and he ſhall truly finde
that all is but civility and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;
yet he will ſay that Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
would ſeeme to be wiſe but
are not. And if a Spaniard looks
upon the actions of a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:80"/>
his never ſtanding ſtill, his
unquietneſſe and impatience, his
flinging away, though he knows
that under ſuch actions there is a
great deale of wit, capacity, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
and wiſedome, yet he will
ſay, that Frenchmen neither
ſeeme nor are wiſe.</p>
               <p>If a Gentleman go to a friends
houſe to viſit him, he will ſcarce
be in, but with a great deale of
mirth he asketh for breakfaſt, if
it bee in the morning, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the time of the day,
wherein hee ſhewes his liberty
and friendſhip, ſeeing that to eate
in one diſh, and drinke in one
cup is a ſigne of fidelity and
friendſhip. Now this would be
abominable and diſgracefull to
the Spaniard, who would rather
ſtarve for hunger and thirſt, then
<pb facs="tcp:57128:80"/>
aske for it in a friends houſe. Yea
there are ſome ſo ſhame-faced,
that will ſit a whole meale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
drinke, onely becauſe they
will not aske for it: as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to certaine countrey people,
who being invited to a Biſhops
houſe, after they had eaten went
to drinke at a river, becauſe they
were not ſo bold as to aske for
drinke at the table. If we aske a
Spaniard what he thinkes of the
manner and faſhion which the
French uſe in ſaluting of Ladies,

                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:83"/>
I went out of Spaine, drawne
by that curioſity to which the
deſire and appetite of knowing
inclines unquiet mindes. And
being told that in France I might
ſatisfie my deſires, I was not ſlow
in taking my journey that waies,
it being neare unto Spaine, and
there being alſo ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
betweene them. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
my journey with as much
eaſe as my poverty could afford
me, which was not ſo great, but
that I did ride on horſeback, and
had ſome money, though not
much, which I alſo was forced
to lay out to make me a ſuit of
cloths. I beleeved that as ſoon as
I ſhould come into France, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other art or oſtentation,
that onely ſeeing of me in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
habit, would make all the
<pb facs="tcp:57128:83"/>
world affect me, and ſtrive who
ſhould firſt have me home to his
houſe. I thought that a ſpanne of
ruffing which I wore ſtiffe ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
would ſerve me for bill of
Exchange; beleeving that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them on, none durſt deny to
lend me money, if I deſired to
borrow of him.</p>
               <p>Then I aſſured my ſelfe that I
ſhould be eſteemed of, reſpected
and in a manner feared, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of ſix palms of rapier which
hanged by my ſide, raking with
the chape upon the ground. At
laſt I arrived into France, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in Spaniſh habit, as may be
preſumed of one that went into
France with a pretence of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
favour, onely becauſe hee
was a Spaniard. I travelled all
the way from Burdeaux to Paris,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:84"/>
without any accident worth the
writing, unleſſe it were ſome baſe
words they gave mee when I
paid my reckonings at Innes;
which becauſe they were of no
great importance, and ſpoken by
people which could not offend
me, I bore with patience. I came
into Paris with that deſire which
the citie deſerves all men ſhould
have, which come to ſee it. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to walke the ſtreets with a
Spaniſh gravity, ſtate and garbe:
yet I was faine to leave it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
my pace, forſaking my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
gravity: for I had not ſcarce
gone twenty paces, when I heard
a noyſe behinde me of children
that called to me, <hi>Senor Senor de
la Burrica pany Ravanicos:</hi> Sir,
Sir, out of your budget bread
and radiſhes, with a thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:57128:84"/>
injurious words, and ſuch
untuned voices, that I was by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
forced to goe into the firſt
houſe that I found open, leaving
the doore and court as full of
little children and men, as if it
had been the Councell chamber
gate. By misfortune there were
three little boyes playing in the
entry, who ſeeing mee in a habit
which they were not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to, did entertaine mee with
ſuch out-cries, fears and ſhreekes,
that with their noiſe many began
to look out at the windows: then
came a groome, who thinking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
had done thoſe children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome
injury, ſtrook me ſuch a blow on
the head with a Curry-comb he
had in his hand, that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
aſtonied me. I thought to
excuſe my ſelf in thoſe troubles,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:85"/>
with ſome humble reaſons; but
it was a kinde of preaching to a
deſart. And ſo after I had made
my complaint to 30. or 40. that
were come into the entry, they
reſolved to put me into the ſtreet,
and turn me over to my firſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors,
who waited at the
doore for me, whoſe number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the one halfe increaſed,
they began to follow mee up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
ſtreet, with ſuch a noiſe
and tumult, that from all ſides
came an infinite of people to ſee
the cauſe of this extraordinary
tumult, thinking I was ſome fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that was whipped up and
down the ſtreets. I was ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and beſides my ſelfe, that
I had not the wit to aske where I
was; and though I could have
done it, yet that accurſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb facs="tcp:57128:85"/>
of Humble-bees did not
give me time to doe it: ſo that all
as I could doe, was to haſten my
pace, endevouring to finde ſome
gate of the Citie, taking it for my
laſt remedy, to goe out of it. But
my evill fortune not yet ſatisfied,
(to my greater confuſion) cauſed
me to ſee a Church which ſtood
open, and a Prieſt ſaying Maſſe
in it, and many hearing of him; I
went in, thanking God a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times for the favour he had
done me, in delivering mee out
of the hands of ſo many Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
I was ſcarce gone up the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſtep, but there began ſuch
a laughter amongſt the poore
lame people that ſtood begging
at the Church doore, that they
which were within the Church
very attentive at maſſe, turning
<pb facs="tcp:57128:86"/>
their backes to the Altar, began
to gaze upon me, and ſecond the
others laughter, whereat I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſo aſtoniſhed and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that I ſtood a great while
ſtill in the midſt of the Church,
turning my ſelfe no way; and I
had ſtood ſo a great while lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
if one of them as ſtood next
to me had not come to mee and
bid me make cleane my cloke.</p>
               <p>So I went into a corner of the
Church, where looking upon
my ſelfe from head to foot, I
found a hares ſcut and a peece of
a ſheepes gut pinned upon my
cloake, and the reſt of it embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with ſpittles and other
filth, which together with my
habit, had beene the cauſe of the
tumult in the ſtreet, and laughter
in the Church; the ſudden mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
<pb facs="tcp:57128:86"/>
of them which heard maſſe
was ſo loud, that the Prieſt loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
about three or foure times, to
ſee the motive of this newes, and
becauſe I perceived he knew that
I was the cauſe of that whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and noiſe, every time he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
himſelfe about to the people
and caſt his eyes upon me, mee
thought he reproved me as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieter
and diſturber of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
reſt. Which did ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
me and make me ſo aſhamed,
that I repented a thouſand times
that I was come into the Church.
Once amongſt the reſt, when the
Prieſt turned towards the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he looked upon me, and
whether it was true, or but onely
my imagination, I thought that
in ſtead of ſaying <hi>Dominus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſcum,</hi>
hee had ſaid to mee,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:87"/>
Why doeſt not thou get thee
hence? with which impreſſion I
ſuddenly went out of the Church
ſo enraged, aſtoniſhed, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
that not looking what was
before me, nor regarding where
I ſet my feet, as I came out of the
doore I hitting my head againſt
a Friers noſe, who ſtood in the
middle of it, begging with a box
in his hand, and gave him ſuch a
knocke, that he fell on his hands
and head to the ground, and the
box tumbled downe the ſteps,
at the bottome whereof ſtood
ten or twelve foot-boies holding
their maſters horſes, who enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
againſt me for the knocke I
hit the Frier, began to make a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,
and hold up their rough
cudgels againſt me: and ſurely
they would have evill entreated
<pb facs="tcp:57128:87"/>
me, if my laying hands on my
patient ſword, and the ſacrednes
of the place where they ſtood
had not ſtayed them. Yet uſing
their tongues for inſtruments of
revenge, they followed me down
the ſtreet with ſuch injurious
words and ſpeeches, as were able
to have ſcandalized the deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
fellow in the world: And
they did not leave me, till croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of a ſtreet, I ſhut my ſelfe up
in a Cookes houſe, where I ſtaid
all night, yeelding infinite thanks
to God for being gotten out of
ſo great a feare and confuſion.</p>
               <p>The day following I reſolved
to take another way, thinking
that of the laſt day to have been
unlucky. And ſo with hope of
better fortune I tooke heart, and
came out of the houſe with the
<pb facs="tcp:57128:88"/>
ſame gravity and ſtatelineſſe as I
uſed before: yet ſtill looking e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
way, to ſee if I met with any
of mine enemies. Truly that day
was lucky, for none followed me
in the ſtreets, onely the Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,
Coblers, and Taylors in
every ſtreet as I went by, would
leave their worke, and ſtanding
upon their doore ſills, would
hiſſe, ſcoffe, and laugh at me till
I was gotten out of their ſight.
Whereof I made ſmall account,
it ſeeming but a paſtime to that
was paſt.</p>
               <p>This manner of contempt and
ſcorne laſted all the while I went
in Spaniſh habit, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
two months, during which
time my very ſoule was tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with divers affronts, fictions,
and jeſts, whereto I could by no
<pb facs="tcp:57128:88"/>
meanes finde any remedy: ſo that
the remainder of that time, I was
forced to goe in the evenings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sunne ſetting, like a night-Bat,
or a man that hid himſelfe
for debt, it being impoſſible by
day to goe in the ſtreet an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
paces, without having twice
as many boyes about me. Once
that I preſumed to goe over a
market place, the ſight of mee
was ſuch a novelty, and ſeemed
ſo ſtrange to certaine women
which ſold radiſhes, ſalads, and
egges, that comming neare one
who was weighing of a Cheeſe
of ten pounds, ſhe ſo wondred,
and was ſo affrighted at the ſight
of me, that the ſcales fell out of
her hands, and both ſcales and
cheeſe fell upon a basket of eggs
which ſtood under them, out of
<pb facs="tcp:57128:89"/>
which immediately began to
runne a ſtreame of whites, and
from her mouth iſſued more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
curſes then doth
come from an Exorciſt to one
poſſeſſed of the divell: the egs
were another womans who
ſtood by her, and perceiving
her ware upon the ground, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſcolding with the other,
tooke hold of three or foure of
her cheeſes, which ſtood there
upon a little table, ſo that the
one ſtriving to take them away
from her, and the other to keepe
them, they ſtrugled ſo long that
both they, the table, cheeſes,
and basket, and all came to the
ground, and falling with their
heeles upwards, diſcovered
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>I ſtood by looking on, and
<pb facs="tcp:57128:89"/>
laughing with the reſt, who
ſtood by looking upon the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
which laſted above a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an houre, ſtruggling, and
ſcratching upon the ground,
with the skirts of their coates
over their heads, ſo that thoſe
that came at laſt could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what it was, ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their buttocks and
their feet. The battaile ended
with ſome little bloud, bruiſes
and loſſe of much haire on both
ſides; and having wiped their
faces which were all bedaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
with butter, egs, durt, and
bloud: ſeeing me there, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that I was the firſt
cauſe of the skirmiſh, they
both with one accord tooke up
the broken egs which lay on the
ground, and ranne towards me
<pb facs="tcp:57128:90"/>
with their haire about their ears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and barefoote throughing them
at me: after them aroſe all the
reſt, and beleeving I had beene
the cauſe of all that miſchiefe,
they began to ſhowre upon me
ſo many ſtones, onions, peares,
whole cabidges, and peeces of
poore John, that they made me
looke blacker, and more diſfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
then they; and I remember
I could make no more uſe of the
cloake nor the hat, ſeeing a
whole army of women upon
me, ſo enraged as they were, I
ſought to eſcape from them run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as nimble as a Deere, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
that gravity, and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
which I profeſſed.</p>
               <p>By good fortune in this my
trouble I met with a gentleman,
who queſtionleſſe had beene in
<pb facs="tcp:57128:90"/>
Spaine, and moved with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
tooke me into a friends
houſe, which by chance was at
the end of that ſtreet, for me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate,
and commanded cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
groomes to make cleane
my cloake, and clothes. I came
out againe, timorous, and angry;
fearing to commit ſome infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
action, as really I had done
if I had drawne my ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ten or fifteene women,
who warred againſt me with
nothing but onions and cabid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and I had ſcarce gone a
hundred paces, but a farre off I
eſpied a troope of people who
very ſilently ſtood hearkning to
a long and ſet diſcourſe which a
blinde man had with a dogge
tied to his girdle in a chaine.
The dogge hearkened to him
<pb facs="tcp:57128:91"/>
attentively, that he truely ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to have judgement and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to apprehend all that was
ſaid unto him. So having made
him dance to the ſound of a
cymball which he carried at
his backe, he began to aske
him certaine queſtions, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt, he ſaid unto him
what wilt thou doe for the King
of France? Then the dogge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to dance and skip, and make
ſuch ſhew of rejoicing, that if
it had beene a man as indeed it
was a beaſt, he that had ſeene
him would have judged him to
be mad or frantick, ſeeing how
he danced and ſtirred about.
This queſtion being paſt, the
blinde man asked him againe,
what he would doe for the King
of Spaine? Lord! who could
<pb facs="tcp:57128:91"/>
relate the fooliſh noiſe which
that beaſt made with barking?
truly the haire upon the ridge of
his backe began to briſtle, hee
grinned with his teeth, turned
his eies awrie, pricked up his
eares, and began to gape ſo wide
that he ſeemed to have a legion
of divells within him. I could
look on no longer, I was ſo enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
&amp; even ſmothered with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
to ſee that the hatred &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
againſt the Spaniſh nation,
ſhould be a means for blind men
to get their livings in France.
Whereupon I reſolved to cloath
my ſelf after the French faſhion,
and conforme my ſelf to the uſe
of the country, perſwading my
ſelfe that I might thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a thouſand inconveniences.</p>
               <p>I went away from that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:92"/>
thinking that my habit
gathered more people toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the blinde man and
his dogge: and ſo taking my
way homewards, I found at
the end of a narrow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented
ſtreet, a woman
ſitting upon her doore ſille, and
giving her child pappe, who
being froward, and untoward,
would by no perſwaſions eate
his pappe. The poore mother
vexed with the childes obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
ſeeing all the faire means
ſhe could uſe, could not make it
take that which ſhe would give
it, made uſe of the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and when I was neare her
ſhe ſaid to it, ſee the Spaniard
that comes to carry away little
boyes that will not eate the
pap: in truth that little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:57128:92"/>
was ſo affrited when it
ſaw me, that full of feare with a
panting heart hee held up his
little hands, as a ſigne to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to give him all the pap at
once: This thing made mee
laugh ſo heartily that for two
houres after, I did nothing but
laugh and wonder at it.</p>
               <p>But if I ſhould particularize
unto you, the broiles, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and couſenings, which the
inkeepers uſed towards mee, I
ſhould never have done. I never
came into an Inne but I came
out of it, with a quarrell, was
couſoned, and yet forced to aske
all thoſe that were preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe:
The quart deſcu in my
hands, or rather in their handes
was worth ten ſols: a relon of
ten ſols was converted into a
<pb facs="tcp:57128:93"/>
halfe quart d'eſcu, and this into
a royall, and that of five royalls
into five ſols: and if I chanced to
reply any thing, they would turn
towards me like Lions, chiding
me, and ſaying, that if I did not
know what value coynes were
of, I ſhould learne, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
with honeſt people that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
God, and caried a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:
and they would tell me
I had no skill in Arithmeticke,
and eſpecially in ſubtraction.
Many times I ſhould buy ſome
wares which I knew would not
waſte at the ayre nor the fire, yet
within a quarter of an houre in a
pound I ſhould finde foure oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
wanting. With theſe and the
like deceipts I paſſed my firſt
dayes, till knowledge and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the countrey ſhewed me
<pb facs="tcp:57128:93"/>
what meanes I ſhould uſe to free
me from theſe evils.</p>

to aske the midwife in what

the contrariety that is betweene

they ſhould have their naturall
<pb facs="tcp:57128:94"/>
beginning, which is their birth,
alike. This contrariety is ſo great
and ſo remarkable, that to define
a Frenchman, one cannot doe it
more properly, then to ſay he is
a Spaniard the contrary way. For
there the Spaniard makes an end
where the Frenchman begins, as
I ſhall ſhew in the following
chapters. As for the ſoule I muſt
confeſſe that they are all created
<hi>in tempore,</hi> and that they are all
of the ſame ſpecies, and that God
doth with one action create and
infuſe them into the organicall
body. And if faith did not teach
me, I ſhould never beleeve, that
French and Spaniſh ſoules were
of the ſame nature. Yet I finde,
that if we conſider the ſoule of it
ſelfe, and without any reference
to the body of either Nation, the
<pb facs="tcp:57128:94"/>
ſoule it ſelfe is neither French
nor Spaniſh: And this ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
unitie which Divinity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
between them, is not againſt
that which I ſay; for conſidering
the ſoule within the body, it is
no more indifferent, but deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to bee either Spaniſh or
French.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I ſay, that the ſoule
determined into a French body,
hath her powers quite contrary
to a Spaniſh one. Firſt the French
underſtanding hath its apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
very quicke, and with a
great deale of eaſe will goe
through any difficulty that can
be propoſed unto it: yet it goeth
no further, nor entreth into dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
diſcourſes, which depend
upon the ſame difficulty: But

it goeth away and is forgotten.
Contrariwiſe, the Spaniards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
is ſlow in apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the difficulty, but having
once underſtood it, he will hold
it faſt, drawing a thouſand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
out of it, and ſifting
every point of it.</p>
               <p>The Spaniard his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is altogether ſpeculative,
ſince that in all his actions, his
end is no other but the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of things, without after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
directing or ſettling of it
upon any ſervile or mechanicall
worke. Wherefore you ſhall
finde few naturall Spaniards of
any mechanick trade, as Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
Taylor, Cobler, Joyner,
Inne-keeper, or the like. For
which I call the French to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:96"/>
who goe into Spaine, and
come backe againe offended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they finde no Alehouſes
nor Innes as they have in France,
ſo that ſometimes they may tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
three dayes and not come at
an Inne, whereby they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to carry meat with them
in their bags, and wine in their
bottles. The French underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is altogether practicall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is not content with the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowledge of things, but
learnes them for to make uſe of
them therein, where he may reap
ſome profit by it, and ſo is not
idle, but to avoid idleneſſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes
it ſelfe in any manner of
exerciſe; and thence growes the
variety of trades in that Nation.
The greateſt part of your French
wits addict themſelves to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb facs="tcp:57128:97"/>
of the Law and Canons, and
very few ſtudy Poſitive or
Schoole Divinitie. Amongſt the
Spaniards few ſtudy the Law,
and almoſt all Divinitie.</p>
               <p>The French underſtanding,
though it receive and hold things
concerning Faith and Religion
for infallible, yet it cannot ſtay
and fixe it ſelfe on them, but will
ſee, conſider, and alſo judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that which faith ſayes is as
he meanes, and finding ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
he runs his boat a ground,
beleeving himſelfe onely, and
denying that which others hold.
The Spaniard his underſtanding
is fearfull, and humble in that
which concernes faith, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the Church. So
that as ſoone as any Article of
faith is propounded unto him, he
<pb facs="tcp:57128:97"/>
preſently ſets bounds to all his
knowledge, wiſedome, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and not onely ſtrives not
to know whether that bee ſo or
no, which the faith ſets downe,
but uſeth all the meanes hee can
to avoid ſpeculation thereon,
fearing to fall into ſome errour
through the frailty of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
Whence groweth the
punctuall obedience which the
Spaniards yeeld to the Church
of Rome, and the difference and
diſſention that is thereupon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the French.</p>
               <p>The French man will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
upon buſineſſes of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
importance, when he is in
moſt company, being not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
by any tumult, noiſe, or
outcrie: ſo that I have noted in
this nation, that your Princes,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:98"/>
Lords, and other perſons of
quality, will diſpatch their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,
and other weighty bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes
ſitting at table, the eating
being no diſturbance to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which they give to a
thouſand people: and ſometimes
they will ſit at meales and have
one of each ſide of them, who
at the ſame time will talke to
them, and they will anſwer
them all as punctually, as if they
were ſhut up privately in a
chamber, without any diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
and had nothing to doe,
but to hearken to them, which
ſpeake to them. All this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Spaniſh underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
who if hee have any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of conſequence, retires
himſelf into ſome ſolitary place,
and is ſuch an enemy of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:57128:98"/>
and tumult, that if a fly comes
buzzing by his eare, when he is
in the depth of his buſineſſe it is
enough to hinder his reſolution.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond power of the ſoul
which is the memory, there is
contradiction, &amp; antipathy, ſince
the French mans is altogether
concerning the preſent: I mean,
that all his actions have none
other end, but that which they
then have and poſſeſſe, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
neither that which is paſt,
nor that which may happen: and
ſo for a content and pleaſure in
hand, they forget all paſt adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and make no count of any
thing which may come, though
they know aſſuredly, that that
very occaſion once paſt, it ſhall
ſurely happen to them. The
Spaniards are quite contrary,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:99"/>
who weigh all their actions with
the ſcale of what is paſt, and
what is to come; not plunging
themſelves, in the content, and
enjoyment of the preſent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thinking, weighing, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming
all inconveniences
which may enſue: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reducing this point to two
words, I ſay: that the French
mans memory is about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
if one may beare preſent
things in memory: and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
is of that which is paſt,
and is to come: the French will
eaſily remember, or forget a
thing, being quickly angry for
any preſent wrong done to
them, and eaſily forget and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
it: Your Spaniards muſt be
much urged before they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
an offence, but once
<pb facs="tcp:57128:99"/>
had in minde, they will hardly
forget it. I could make a
whole book and a large volume,
of the contrarieties, and antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
which are in their wills,
if I might ſpeak all that which
truly I might, without diſtaſting
of neither nation: I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be content, without tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the vertues or vices, which
might bee found in either, God
onely being perfect, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fault, to ſay that there is no
nation in the world ſo patient,
and ſuffering, as the Spaniſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is; ſo that it will never quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
nor contend, unleſſe it be
upon a more then urgent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which muſt prick him on to
it. The French contrariwiſe, if
you doe them but a haires
breadth of offence or injury, he
<pb facs="tcp:57128:100"/>
preſently makes a breach, and
will never reſt till they be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by fighting.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards are true, firme,
and conſtant in their loves; ſo
that many times they goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the bounds of affection,
adoring that which they love,
and with ſo much fidelity, that
they would bee afraid to annoy
it ſo much as with a thought, and
they inviolably preſerve this
faith; no chance whatſoever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to remove them from
what they profeſſe, yea they are
ſo affected to their will, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times they loſe their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which never happens to
the French who are ſo mutable
in their wills, and purpoſes, and
ſo voluble that having ſet their
affection upon one, they will
<pb facs="tcp:57128:100"/>
ſettle it upon a hundred more,
if ſo many ſhould come to them.
And if any there be, as there are
many, that have not this defect:
yet their affections are to
changeable, that the leaſt anger
in the world, will change their
fire of love into a colder ſnow,
then that which is in winter upon
the Pyrenean mountaines.</p>
               <p>A French man that is in his
Miſtriſſes favour, will doe what
he can to let his friendes and all
the world know his being in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and his being acceptable
unto her: a thing much abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Spaniard, who if he
be in any ſuch predicament, with
all care and diligence, will ſeeke
to hide his content from his
friends, and all the world, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from himſelfe, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
<pb facs="tcp:57128:101"/>
Finally, in this particuler
they have two contrary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
The French man ſeekes to
have that ſeene, which lies hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
The Spaniard ſeekes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, then to hide that
which is outward and in light.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards delight ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly,
in outward apparance,
and honour, caring more to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the world, then for their
owne intereſts; ſo that they care
not for ſuffering want or miſery,
ſo that it be not known: and there
are ſome who being in places
that they muſt goe abroad,
handſome in cloathes, want will
bring them to that extremity,
that they will faſt two daies to
have a handſome cloak, and a
ſtarched ruffe, to goe abroad in,
and they will carry themſelves
<pb facs="tcp:57128:101"/>
ſo luſtily, well diſpoſed, and
haughty, that you would thinke
they had kept a very good houſe.
Contrariewiſe the French have
no other end in their actions, but
their proper intereſt, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
ſo that if he may but fare
well in his diet, he cares not
what the world can ſay: and if
neceſſity ſorce him to it, he will
ſell his cloake, his ſword, yea his
very ſhirt, and drawers; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he hath conſumed them, hee
will goe forth naked if need be
into the ſtreet, to give his friends
ſatisfaction; holding it no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to ſay that he hath ſold
them to buy food. If a Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
be ſo neere driven that hee
muſt ſell his cloathes, to buy
food; hee will firſt ſell his ſhirt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſeeing that with his doublet, and
<pb facs="tcp:57128:102"/>
ruffe, he covers the want of it;
and if his need increaſes he will
ſell his doublet, covering his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with his cloake, after his
doublet goes his ſword, after
that his ruffe; and the laſt thing
of all is his cloake. But the
French man when he is in want,
doth quite contrary, beginning
where the Spaniard ends, and
the firſt thing hee ſells is his
cloake, next his doublet, then
his britches, and laſt of all his
ſhirt: in want there is none more
valiant and fearleſſe then the
Spaniard; nor is there any are
more timorous then the French,
if he want victualls. A Spaniard
will live three daies upon a
peece of bread, and will not bee
diſmaid, or ſhew loſſe of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
but if the French man
<pb facs="tcp:57128:102"/>
wants his pottage but one day
he thinkes himſelfe loſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
               <p>A Spaniards generoſitie is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
when he begs an almes; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hee will never confeſſe hee
doth it for neceſſity, but by ſome
accident or diſaſter; that he was
forced to ſave his life and his
honour, to cloath himſelfe in a
poore habit, &amp; beg in the ſtreets;
and the words he uſeth when he
begs ſhall bee theſe or the like:
Pleaſe you, Sir, to doe ſome cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie
for a poore cavallier, who is
come out of his Countrey for
ſuch a miſchance; that hee hath
beene forced to cloath himſelfe
in this habit as you ſee: And
when you know who it is that
begs (as long it ſhall not bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you doe know) you will
<pb facs="tcp:57128:103"/>
thinke your ſelfe happy that you
pleaſured a man of my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and qualitie; and if by chance
he that hears him, and hearkens
to his complete ſpeeches, aske
him who hee is, and what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
he hath had; having firſt
made him ſweare that he wil not
diſcover him, he will anſwer that
he is nephew to an Earle or Duke,
or brother to the Admirall of
Caſtile, and that a great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
falling in love with him, he
conveyed her out of her fathers
houſe in mans apparell, which
being diſcovered by her parents,
he was forced to abſent himſelfe
and live in that faſhion unknown,
till his friends had made peace;
and hee will ſay that he hath fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
or twenty thouſand crowns
a year, and eight or ten Baronies:
<pb facs="tcp:57128:103"/>
Finally, the Spaniard then ſhews
his generoſity moſt, when hee
ſees himſelfe moſt croſſed. But
if a Frenchman comes to that
paſſe, that he hath not a peny, nor
any thing to ſell for food, good
Lord who can rehearſe his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions!
his ſtratagems, his wry
mouths, and ſhruggings, to make
his miſery knowne, and to draw
men to beſtow an almes upon
him? Hee will ſhrinke up his
ſhoulders, croſſe his hands, fall
on his knees, beat his breaſt,
weepe, and with a dolefull hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
voice full of anguiſh, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you to give him a farthing,
to buy him bread, ſeeing he hath
eaten nothing in three dayes; he
will ſay he hath nothing in this
world that he can depend upon,
nor any that can afford him any

               <p>The contrariety of body
which is betweene the French

ranke; neither advancing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
nor tarrying behinde,
though they meet with other
company, and bee juſtled by
them; or though they juſtle, and
be ready to overthrow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
The Spaniards doe quite
contrary; for if they be above
<pb facs="tcp:57128:110"/>
three in company, they will goe
together but onely two and two,
ſo that when they are many,
they make as it were a proceſſion:
when the French walke alwaies
in their turnings they keepe their
places: the Spaniards change at
every turne, thoſe going into the
middle which were on the ſides:
the French ordinarily walke as
faſt, as if they had Sergeants at
their heeles: the Spaniards walke
with ſuch leaſure and gravity,
that they that ſee them, thinke
they have lately beene ſicke, or
have yet ſome quartane ague:
your French uſe to walke about
the city booted and ſpurd, the
Spaniards cannot indure it; and if
they doe chance to walke in
bootes, they will not weare
ſpurs: your French when they
<pb facs="tcp:57128:110"/>
are a horſeback, ride alwaies a
full trot: the Spaniards ride lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely:
The French mens foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes
runne after their Maſters
when they ride: the Spaniards go
before: your Spaniards on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe
weare their cloakes and
ſwords, and their mans ſword
too: amongſt the French, the
Page carries his Maſters ſword
and cloake: if a French man
walkes penſive, he lets his cloak
hang upon one ſhoulder, and
holds his hand upon the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell
of his ſword, the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
caſts out his legs, and turnes
up his muſtachioes: when your
French goe together in the ſtreet
they leape, laugh, and make a
noiſe, that you may heare them
a mile off: the Spaniards walke
upright, ſtiffe, and grave, ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:111"/>
nor make any uncivill or
unmodeſt action: the French
man when he meets a friend, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes
him with his whole body,
bending downe his head, kiſſing
his hands, and making legs, and
ſtand halfe an houre in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
the Spaniard holds his
body and his head, as ſtiffe as a
ſtake, &amp; only with the pulling off
his hat, requites the prolixe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies,
and reiterated ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the French: a French
man though noble will make no
difficulty, to pull an apple out of
his pocket, or buy it in the ſtreet,
and eate it before all the world:
a thing ſo abhorred by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
that hee would not doe it
for the world, fearing to offend
them that look upon him: when
the French man ſeeth ſome body
<pb facs="tcp:57128:111"/>
a farre off and would becken to
him, he lifts up his hand towards
his ſhoulders: the Spaniard
caſts his hand downe, holding
it towards his feet.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:113"/>
the world, and that they were
all three uſed between God, the
ſerpent, and man: They ſay that
when God commanded <hi>Adam</hi>
he ſhould not eat of the tree of
knowledge, he ſpake to him in
Spaniſh, ſhewing thereby that
the property of that language
was gravity, imperiouſnes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and nobleneſſe: after God
had given him this command
they ſay the ſerpent, the better
to induce him to ſin, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
Gods command, ſpake to
him in Italian, to ſhew us that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all languages there is
none ſo perſwaſive, ſweet, and
affected, as the Italian: after our
firſt parents had ſinned God
called them, and asking them
the cauſe of their diſobedience,
they anſwered him in French,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:113"/>
there being no language to free
and excuſe themſelves like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
               <p>As for the reſt it is ſeene by
experience that the French ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
do ſpeak much, and aloud,
the Spaniards a little, and ſoftly.
If one aske a Spaniard why hee
came out of Spaine, hee will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that the King ſent for him,
becauſe he ſhould go treat about
ſome buſineſſe of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And if you aske a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
the ſame queſtion, hee will
ſay he went a pilgrimage to St.
<hi>Iaques</hi> in Galicia, or to viſit the
holy Crucifixe of Burges, and
that his fellow dying in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitall,
he ſtaid behinde looking
for ſome company to goe home
into his Countrey with him. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
you ſhall get nothing out
<pb facs="tcp:57128:114"/>
of a Spaniard that is out of Spain,
but greatneſſe, nobility, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
and from a Frenchman
when he is in Spaine, you ſhall
heare nothing but abaſing of
himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Your Spaniards have a noted
property, different from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations, which is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of their Countrey, they
love one another, honour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
one another extreamly,
though at home they have beene
mortall enemies. And if any one
queſtions him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
asking him who, and what
he is, though you queſtion him
about the pooreſt fellow in the
world, and the ſonne of a cobler,
he will anſwer with great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and ſay, Is it poſſible Sir
that you doe not know that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallier,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:114"/>
and that you have not
heard of him (though perhaps he
hath never a ſhooe on his feet) I
dare lay a wager, that there is
ſcarce in the City or Kingdome
a childe of five yeares old but
doth know him, at leaſt if he bee
of any faſhion. You ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
Sir, that he is ſonne to the
Maggioraſco of Caſtile, and of
the greateſt families of Spaine;
and there are many that ſay, hee
is ſecond couſin to King <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian:</hi>
yet hee goes diſguiſed,
and in the habit you ſee, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of ſome miſchance; and I
beſeech you, Sir, not to diſcover
him: for if the King ſhould know
of it, hee would take it very ill,
that he did not goe directly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
at Court: and hee would
not for all the world be known.
<pb facs="tcp:57128:115"/>
If a Frenchman, or any of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nation, meets with another
Countrey-man out of France,
preſently they become mortall
enemies, ſpeaking the worſt they
can one of another; and if any
one deſires to know, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
what his companion is,
he will with all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
ſay: Sir, that is a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
a poore Carpenters ſonne,
whoſe fathers goods were all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away for debt, and had not
above eight or ten crowns left,
with which hee bought that ſuit
at the Brokers, which makes him
ſeeme to bee ſome fine fellow;
but before foure dayes comes to
an end, hee will ſell it, and then
you ſhall ſee him goe a begging:
and ſo will ſpeake the worſt hee
can of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:115"/>
All the induſtry in the world
cannot make a Frenchman keep
a ſecret, but that hee muſt needs
reveale it: And all the drugges
in the Indies ſhall not get a ſecret
from a Spaniard. Finally, all the
Spaniards actions are contrary to
the French, and there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordancie
nor reſemblance in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them.</p>

Chriſtendome alſo in part yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

of theſe two nations lying

their enemies muſt increaſe, and
ſo innumerable hereſies, errors,
ſects, and unbeleefes ſpread
themſelves abroad in the world,
by which the body of the
Church is daily perſecuted and
evill intreated: wherefore the
divell being cunning and well
experienced, made uſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
and ſtrategeme of the
good ſhepeard, when a troope of
wolves fall upon his ſheepe,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:117"/>
which is to ſet his dogs, and
maſtifs upon them, that whileſt

A cunning and marveilous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the divell to come to
his accurſed ends: He ſaw plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that if he left the ſtrength and
mouthes of theſe two valiant Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
unmuzelled, they would
have ſwallowed up all infidelity
and barbariſme, filling it with all
manner of holineſſe and vertue,
ſo that there would have nothing

to loſe the command he had

and diſcord to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe two nations, and ſo
diverted them, that they might
not diſturbe the increaſe and
<pb facs="tcp:57128:118"/>
proſperity of his vaſſals, and
truely when I conſider this
point, I am aſtoniſhed with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
being not able to imagine
or think, what vaile or cataract, ſo
blinds theſe Nations, as that they
cannot ſee theſe evills; and that
they will ſuffer their enemies to

of that reputation they hold in

               <p>And if the zeale of their

to open their eies, and to take it
ill, that they being ſtiled the one
moſt Chriſtian, and the other
moſt Catholick; a barbarous

and many other poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Provinces, which onely
implore the favour, and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe two Nations or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, for to bring them
out of the wretched ſlavery and
ſervitude wherein they live: yet
might they be moved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion;
by reaſon that it is one of
the eaſieſt &amp; ſecureſt enterpriſes
that is in the world; as it is well
knowne to them who have been
in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>This is the ſnare wherewith
the divell keeps tied the ſtrength
of theſe two Nations, and the
vaile which hee hangs before
their eies: there being at this
<pb facs="tcp:57128:119"/>
time an infinite number of vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
ſouldiers buried in ſloth, who
ſtudy nothing, but how to undo
and breake the Spaniſh power,
and policy: who if they were
imploied againſt the infidells
would performe more heroicall
exploits then <hi>Homer</hi> writes of
<hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Vlyſſes.</hi> With ſuch
perſwaſions and deceits doth this
curſed enemy bewitch a great
number of Cavalliers &amp; Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that live contented with
their meane fortunes, who if they
would employ their valours and
warlike courages in Turky, would
not make plaine Cavalliers, but
mighty Monarchs. In the ſame
manner are in France many Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
Princes, and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Lords, which following
the ordinary courſe of the Court,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:119"/>
and ſervice of their King, live at
home, who if they did put to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
the inclination of their
noble mindes in Africke or in
Aſia, would conquer more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
then <hi>Ferdinand Corteſe</hi>
did in America. Wherefore I
know not by what diabolicall
witchcraft ſuch noble underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
are blinded, that they doe
not perceive that by this hatred
and enmity, both Nations loſe
many Crownes and Kingdomes
which they might have ſubject
to their dominions. And that
their union ſhould not onely not
ſuffer themſelves to hurt one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
but neither of them to bee
hurt by other Nations, but be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
alſo, that ſuch a concord
and amity could have no other
end nor iſſue, but the ſervice of
<pb facs="tcp:57128:120"/>
God, the exaltation of his
Church, the peace of the world,
the baniſhing of infidelity, and
the increaſe of the common
good. Things which this peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
venome of enmity, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and hinders, there redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from it nothing but multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of hereſies in Europe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of ſects and religions in
the Eaſt, the obſervance of beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſalvage cuſtomes and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
in thoſe parts of Libia and
Ethiopia, the exaltation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets
law in Africke and Aſia,
the Turks ſwelling pride in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,
the little reſpect and
diſcourteſie of the King of Feſſe
and Marocco, the poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
miſeries which live among
the infidels, the captivity of the
holy Sepulchre, the martyrdoms
<pb facs="tcp:57128:120"/>
and torments of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſlaves in heathen lands,
the multitude of Lordſhips and
States, which know no Kings
nor Lords, the perſecution of the
Catholicke Church, the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations
and commotions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
the ſmall ſecurity
of neighbours, the contempt of
thoſe who are farre off, and the
boldneſſe of vaſſalls. All theſe
things happen by reaſon of the
hatred and enmity of theſe two
nations, which certainly if they
were as well united in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of wills, as they are in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
by way of marriage,
ſcarce the world were able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the force of ſuch an union.
In witneſſe whereof I will alledge
a reaſon which an old and wiſe
Moore told me upon a Friday in
<pb facs="tcp:57128:121"/>
Conſtantinople, who after hee
had long queſtioned with mee
concerning the manner of living
of the Kings of Europe, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of theſe two kingdoms,
which they confeſſe to bee the
chiefe and the moſt powerfull of
Chriſtendome, he told me that
every time they came into their
Moſcheas to ſay their prayers,
they prayed to God that the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of theſe two Nations might
laſt for ever, that the one being
continually ſuſpicious and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtfull
of the other, they might
not remember them, nor thinke
upon taking armes againſt them.</p>

               <p>I Have endeavoured divers
times to finde out by ſpeulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fundamentall cauſe of the
diſdaine and hatred betweene
theſe two Nations: Becauſe that
though it is true, that the Divell
hath been the principall authour
of this antipathy and diſcord, to
hinder the fruit which might
grow through their union, yet we
muſt preſume, that hee found in
them ſome ground and root to
increaſe ſuch a curſed diſſention,
and pernitious poyſon.</p>
               <p>Some doe attribute this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
to the difference of the
<pb facs="tcp:57128:122"/>
ſtarres, and their influences, as
their univerſall cauſe, and ſay,
that the ſituation of the heavens,
and conſtellation of Spaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
farre different from that
which the French have, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the temperament and
humours of both muſt bee very
different. They confirme this
with <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doctrine in his
booke <hi>de Aere, Aquis &amp; Locis,</hi>
which ſaith, that the divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of the ſtarres, is cauſe
of the variety of temperaments,
complexions and humours of
man. And verily hee that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
the humours of theſe two
Nations in order with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation
and change of time,
ſhall find ſome likelihood in this
reaſon; ſeeing that in Spaine, if
hot weather once begins, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
<pb facs="tcp:57128:122"/>
in the ſame vigour three
or foure months, there being in
all that time no notable change;
and of the ſame compaſſe is the
Spaniſh humour: ſeeing that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon a purpoſe, hee keeps
himſelfe firme in it, without any
change or alteration at all. It is
otherwiſe in France: for there,
bee it Winter or Summer, the
cold nor the heat, nor the faire
weather, never laſts three dayes
together; but the variableneſſe
of this conſtellation is ſuch, that
a man can never perceive what
time of the yeare it is. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of Paris know this to bee
true, becauſe that in one day
there you ſhall have the weather
change eight or ten times, the
morning or day breake being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faire, and two hours after there
<pb facs="tcp:57128:123"/>
falling a deluge of rain: after the
which, the Sunne will appeare
more bright and reſplendent
then in the month of June: and
hee ſhall ſcarce have ſpread his
beams, but you ſhall heare a noiſe
of thunder, lightning and winde,
as though the world were ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and therefore there being a
dependencie from the influence
and conſtellation, the French, as
ſubjected to an inconſtant cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
muſt needs be voluble and
inconſtant in their determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And therfore hee that will
aſſigne for the reaſon of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
and hatred, the diverſity
of climates, will ſay, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
grounded his malice upon
nature, making uſe of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of the ſtarres.</p>
               <p>This reaſon, though in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb facs="tcp:57128:123"/>
it bears ſome ſhew of truth,
yet it doth not reſolve our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion:
ſeeing that though the
ſtarres have dominion over na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
things, yet they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their force to acts of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
command of the will, which
are hatred and love, and therfore
we muſt confeſſe, that thoſe who
bring this reaſon, that the ſtarres
encline things ſubject unto them,
(yet naturall ones) and by reaſon
of the league, which it hath with
their wills, this influence may
ſomewhat touch them, moving
them in ſome manner, but yet it
cannot force them.</p>
               <p>And ſince this matter gives
me occaſion of ſpeaking of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
which is commonly
handled by curious and learned
men, I will not paſſe it over with
<pb facs="tcp:57128:124"/>
ſilence, without ſpeaking that
which my ſmall talent will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord

our will, after ſinne, remained ſo
contrary to the law of Reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:57128:125"/>
and ſo annexed to the ſenſitive

thoſe things which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
unto it; which ſenſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
governed by the influence
and power of the ſtarres, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and depending on them, the

which the appetite propounds

judging the actions of
the will by the influence which
governes the ſenſitive appetite,
many times prognoſticate the
truth, though abſolutely it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the will of man.</p>
               <p>From this doctrine, though
true, it followeth not, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of the ſtarres onely, and
the diverſity of the clymates are
the fundamentall cauſes of the
<pb facs="tcp:57128:126"/>
hatred &amp; antipathy of theſe two
nations: being there are many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nations in the world, farre
more different in climates, and
conſtellations, which have not ſo
much hatred and contrariety a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves, as theſe two:
we muſt therefore find out ſome
other reaſon, more powerfull,
then this of the ſtarres.</p>
               <p>I remember I have read in the
hiſtories of France, that King
<hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, came to
meet the King of Caſtile upon
the confines of France, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with him about ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of importance. This King
though magnanimous and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
had notwithſtanding his
particuler humour, as other men
have, and ſo he ordinarily wore
a leaden medall in his hat, his
<pb facs="tcp:57128:126"/>
cloathes, and other French mens
who were his followers were
ordinary, and of meane ſtuffe;
ſo that he was but meanly cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
without any ſtatelineſſe or
pompe: the Spaniards did cloath
themſelves the beſt they could,
uſing all the pompe they could,
beleeving that the King of
France would have come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
the greatneſſe and variety as
they expected from ſo great a
King: and ſeeing him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
they began to deſpiſe him,
and ſtrangely to ſcoffe the
French men; where they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſuch hatred againſt the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,
that they could never
ſince forget this diſgrace and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front:
and if we will ſay that the
devill at this meeting grounded
the enmity, and antipathy which
<pb facs="tcp:57128:127"/>
now a daies raignes, we ſhall not
ſay amiſſe, ſeeing a farre leſſer
ground then this will ſerve his
turne.</p>
               <p>To all that is ſaid before may
be added a great motive which
theſe two Nations have had to
contemne and abhorre one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
which is that in times paſt,
there came not out of France in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Spaine any people of ſort
and note, but onely poore beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
and needy people of the
frontiers, as Guaſcons, Biernois,
and others, who went as they do
to this day in white round caps
like a trencher upon their heads,
bare legged, with wooden ſhoos
which they call eſclops upon
their feet; theſe with a baſe kind
of avarice will put themſelves to
any baſe office, as keeping of
<pb facs="tcp:57128:127"/>
cowes, and hogs, to ſweepe
chimneies or the like, and though
in their eating they bee ſober e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
for with an onion, or a
head of garlicke, and a peece of
bread they will paſſe the whole
day, yet in their drinking they
are unreaſonable, and all their
gaines goeth in wine, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtrong and heady, preſen<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly
makes them drunke, ſo that for
the moſt part of the day they go
reeling and falling about the
ſtreets, to the great ſcandall of
the Spaniards, amongſt whom
there is no greater infamy or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
then to bee drunke:
wherefore the Spaniards who
ſaw no other French men but
theſe, &amp; thought that all the reſt
had been like them, did abhor
them, and conceive much enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:57128:128"/>
againſt them, and contempt
of them; the ſame occaſion had
the French, for very few or no
Spaniards of faſhion going into
France, and they ſeeing none but
poore and wretched people who
went to bee touched for the
Kings evill, verily beleeved that
all other Spaniards had been of
the ſame kinde; and ſo from
that baſeneſſe they tooke occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to hold the Spaniards in little
eſteeme; and beſides this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to encreaſe this mortall
enmity; each of theſe foreſaid
reaſons in my minde, are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
occaſions and motives of the
hatred and diſdaine we finde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe two Nations, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the divell mixing his care
and induſtry with it: But if I
ſhould ſpeake mine opinion, I
<pb facs="tcp:57128:128"/>
think there cannot be a more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull
reaſon given for this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy,
then the naturall contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of theſe two Nations hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors:
and ſo it being ſo hard a
thing to force nature with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
I doe not wonder, if the will
in which conſiſts hatred or love,
keeps company with nature, and
followes her ſteps, obeying her
contrarieties and repugnances;
and we muſt imagine, that to
move the will ſo much the more
to the contrariety of humors,
the divell did helpe forward all
the forenamed accidents; ſo that
the conſtellation, the diverſity
of humours, the contempt of
both nations, and the divell joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
together, there could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be hoped for, but a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
hatred, and the antipathy
<pb facs="tcp:57128:129"/>
which now we ſee; the remedy
of which lieth in God only; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I doe not beleeve that on
earth there is any antidote for
ſuch a peſtilent poiſon.</p>

it was impoſſible to arrive to the

with the imperfection of

architect finding that
there could bee no equality nor
proportion found between his
greatneſſes, and our humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
they being infinite,
and this materiall &amp; limited: he
ordained that man ſhould come
<pb facs="tcp:57128:130"/>
to the knowledge of his infinite
power, by meanes of the viſible
effects of this world.</p>
               <p>Whence we ſhall ſee by this
reaſon that God at all times did
communicate himſelf to men by
materiall, and viſible means, as in
the guiding of the people of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
by day with a pillar of cloud,
&amp; by night with a pillar of fire,
making mount Sinai to ſhake
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he gave the Law, affrighting
them with thunder &amp; lightning,
ſending fire from heaven, the
deluge and the like, by which
he did accommodate himſelfe
to the imperfection of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
For if God ſhould
not uſe materiall things, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to bee underſtood, perhaps
the underſtanding of man,
would either attribute ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb facs="tcp:57128:131"/>
to ſome other cauſe, or
would not know from whence
they proceeded. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that when God decreed to
deſtroy the world with the
floud, hee could as well have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated
and deſtroyed it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
filling of it full of water, or
doing any other manifeſt and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
action; but it would not
have ſeemed ſo great a wonder
to men, if they were all fallen
dead without any manifeſt
cauſe, as the rivers over-flowing
of their bankes, and the opening
of the cataracts and windows of
heaven was.</p>
               <p>And though God could have
deſtroyed thoſe accurſed cities
of Sodom and Gomorrah, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any apparent ſigne, with
making them fall ſimply, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:57128:131"/>
any other viſible effect; yet
he would have their ruine be by
meanes of a materiall cauſe,
which ſhould manifeſt the great
power of him who ſent to doe
ſuch an execution, as that was,
to make fire (as the ſacred
text ſpeaketh) and brimſtome to
come downe from heaven, a
ſigne that hee could make even
the groſſeſt underſtanding know
what the power of divine juſtice
was: for if God had uſed ſome
inſenſible meanes, the cauſe
would not have been knowne,
nor his great might and power.
So alſo when hee gave the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
their freedome, taking them
out of Egypt, hee could in the
night have opened the gates of
the citie, and made them come
out, or by day have blinded all
<pb facs="tcp:57128:132"/>
the people of Egypt, that they
might not have ſeene them, or
finde ſome other meanes to free
them out of bondage; but if he
had done ſo, hee had not cauſed
that feare which materiall means
did, and the viſible tokens which
he ſhewed, in turning the waters
into bloud, filling the land with
Locuſts and Frogges, and Flies,
with other marvailous wonders
&amp; effects; by means of which, all
that barbarous people, and even
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelfe confeſſed the
omnipotencie of the God of the
Hebrewes, and beſought <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and his brother <hi>Aaron</hi> to pray for
them, that thoſe plagues might
be taken away from them, and
that they would obey him. And
if God had uſed ſome other
ſigne as had not been ſo plaine
<pb facs="tcp:57128:132"/>
and manifeſt as this, and that
which hee uſed at the red Sea,
peradventure the Egyptians
would not have attributed the
deliverance of their ſlaves to the
power of God: nor the people of
Iſrael, who was rough and of a
hard beliefe, would have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that he by his omnipotence
onely could have wrought any
ſuch effect.</p>
               <p>In the law of Grace God uſed
the ſame meanes to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
knowne, ſeeing that all the
miracles which hee wrought (as
the Evangeliſts ſet them downe)
were done by ſenſible and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
ſignes; from which every
groſſe and rough underſtanding
might gather the greatneſſe and
the ſupreme power of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
For who could be ſo groſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:133"/>
but ſeeing ſight reſtored to a
blinde man with onely laying a
little dirt upon his eyes, might
not know that the dirt of it ſelfe
had no ſuch vertue; and that
therefore hee who applied that
medicine, had a command above
nature? And who will but ſay,
ſeeing a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who had lyen
in the grave foure dayes, rayſed
onely by ſaying, <hi>Lazarus come
forth,</hi> that hee had power over
death? And that the ſatisfying
five thouſand people with five
loaves and two fiſhes, onely by
bleſſing of them, doth not infer
ſupreme worth and power? And
that ſeeing the healing of one,
the reſtoring of ſight to another,
turning water into wine, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
death by naturall means, doe
not preſuppoſe that this is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
<pb facs="tcp:57128:133"/>
power and vertue?
And if that Chriſt had done
theſe wonders without viſible
and materiall meanes, onely by
his abſolute power, peradventure
his infinite power had not beene
knowne: and therefore let us
conclude with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that by
meanes of viſible and materiall
things, wee come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the inviſible things of
God, as his Infiniteneſſe, his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity,
his Goodneſſe and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie.
And if in all nature
there be any viſible thing which
ſheweth us this divine power, it
is the miraculous conjunction of
theſe two Nations, ſo prodigious
a one, that any groſſe underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
may plainly perceive, that it
is an immediate worke of Gods
omnipotencie, which only could
<pb facs="tcp:57128:134"/>
undoe that which the Divell
with ſo much diligence and art
had done: ſince we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that any ſecondary cauſes
could have ſo much worth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
and power, as in an inſtant
to unite two natures ſo infinitely
diſtant one from the other, and
make them come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an extream
hatred and enmity, to the other
extreame of union. And ſeeing
that if the diſcord and contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of theſe two Nations, had
been a new or ſuperficiall acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
the onely conſideration of
good underſtandings, and the
perſpicuity of wiſe and prudent
perſons, might have been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to remedy it, but being nature
and antipathy, which like origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſin goes by ſucceſſion from
the Fathers to the children, and
<pb facs="tcp:57128:134"/>
ſo to the grand-children; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
being foſtered and
maintained by the Divels ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
we muſt infallibly beleeve,
that it is the worke of heaven,
and that this union was onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to God, for to prevent
an abyſſe of evils and miſeries,
which by the ſaid enmity were
threatned. And ſo God, to whoſe
goodneſſe it belongeth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſweetly of things, having
created and preſerved the world
by means of the union and peace
of his creatures, ſeeing that the
diſcord of theſe two Nations
was ſufficient almoſt to ruine it,
ſtayed through his omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
the fury of this raging evill,
and through his goodneſſe and
mercie, provided ſuch a perfect
and ſalutiferous remedy as this
<pb facs="tcp:57128:135"/>
divine union is, that ſo the world
might not only be freed from its
imminent ruine, &amp; the calamities
which threatned it by reaſon of
this enmity, but might alſo bee
enriched with thoſe pretious
fruits which from this union
may be expected.</p>
               <p>And as the end which God
pretended in this confederacie,
is no other but this: ſo it is
plainly knowne that the Divell
with all his followers, hath not
had power to hinder the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, though hee raiſed a
thouſand inventions, pretences,
and feares, both amongſt the
common people, and alſo the
moſt Noble, egging them on
with the fire of enmity and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
to oppoſe themſelves with
all the power as might bee, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:57128:135"/>
Gods decree, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
repoſe, and the
good of the whole world: and
though the Divell went looſe,
and puffed up, holding the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
certaine with his forces, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that ſmall aid which was
promiſed; yet his care and labour
being againſt the will of God,
and the univerſall peace, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not that God did ſend a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to breake his head, through
the wiſdom of ſo good a phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
whileſt hee laid wait and
ſnares for her heele.</p>
               <p>And though there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon to prove that this
confederacie came from heaven,
this would of it ſelfe be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
proofe, that wee ſee it was
gloriouſly effected, againſt all
humane endevours, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb facs="tcp:57128:136"/>
difficulties, and againſt
ſuch great oppoſitions, as I will
now leave to the wiſe mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
and the pennes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who peradventure will
write of this matter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I conclude, ſaying, that this
conjunction being made at that
time, when this antipathy was
moſt rooted between theſe two
Nations, wee muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
that it was done by divine
power, ſince neither hatred, nor
diſdaine, nor the diverſity of
climates and humours, nor the
variety of cuſtomes, nor miſtruſt,
nor the Divels endevours were
able to hinder it.</p>

               <p>IT will not be hard to perſwade
an underſtanding man, that this

comes from heaven, &amp;

that inacceſſible and majeſticall
Conſiſtorie of the holy Trinity:
ſeeing that in it God hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
three effects of his immenſe
God-head, which are, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie
in uniting from an infinite
diſtance. Mercie in preventing
an abyſſe of miſchiefes, which
threatned the world: and Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in eſtabliſhing an union
&amp; indiſſoluble marriage. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
wee are to conſider, that
God was not contented (by fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
out of ſuch a way &amp; means)
to remedy the preſent evill, but
like a good Phyſitian hee left an
antidote and medicine to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
theſe two Nations from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
infirmity or danger as might
enſue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:138"/>
This healthfull medicine
which God ſent into the world
is matrimony the moſt effectuall
and ſtrong meanes that could
be found in nature, the wills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby ſo ſtraightly knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that they being two that
are united, come to be one fleſh,
and ſo conformable and united,
that it cauſeth one to forget fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and mother and brethren, to
forſake his country, his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and even himſelfe; for
married folkes many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
themſelves of their owne
liberties, to ſubject themſelves
to the content and deſire of one
another; wherefore marriage
bringing forth ſuch effects, wee
may ſay that God by meanes of
it uniting theſe two actions,
found an extreame and exquiſite

                  <pb facs="tcp:57128:140"/>
remedy, for an extreame and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
diſeaſe, there being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to it by ſucceſſion an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and perfect union, out of
danger of ever being loſt, by
reaſon of the ſtability promiſed
in thoſe thinges which come
from heaven; where I dare ſay
there could not have been found
an inventio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more to the purpoſe,
or more ſecure then this was;
ſeeing there is nothing in the
world that can mortifie the fire
of enmity and diſcord more then
the matrimoniall knot, which
once contracted between two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
when they thinke the
grievances and diſtaſtes which
are paſt, they quite forget them
againe, having not the heart or
minde to perſecute or offend ſo
much as in thoght, thoſe that are
<pb facs="tcp:57128:140"/>
of their owne blood, or have
any dependency of it.</p>
               <p>The Romans (as hiſtories re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
made uſe of ſuch remedies,
when they ſaw themſelves moſt
perſecuted by the Sabines, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom there was ſo
much enmity, hatred, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
that they did deſtroy and
ruine one another, burning their
corne, ſpoiling their vines, and
killing one another whereſoever
they met; whereby other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which were not ſubject to
them grew the ſtronger, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
through their two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and diſcords: ſo that at
the laſt they perceiving the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
and wrongs they did
themſelves by perſecuting one
another, and the triumphs and
glory which other nations got,
<pb facs="tcp:57128:141"/>
grounding their happineſſe and
greatneſſe upon their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
they agreed to uſe for a
remedy the ſame meanes which
God had uſed with theſe two
nations; which was, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
determined to give their
daughters in marriage to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines
ſonnes, and the Sabines
held it for an excellent good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
to give their daughters
unto the Romans ſons, that ſo by
this mixture the evill might bee
remedied, &amp; the nations remain
in peace and concord: and it is
certain that though the Romans
remembred the wrongs, &amp; inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
they had received at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines
hands, &amp; that through this
remembrance there might ſome
appetite and deſire of revenge be
ſtirred up: yet when they ſaw
<pb facs="tcp:57128:141"/>
that if they executed their rage
and fury, they muſt doe it upon
their owne blouds, having their
daughters amongſt the Sabines,
they ſtaied themſelves from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them any hurt: which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
ſerved alſo for a bridle
to the Sabines, knowing that
they could not uſe their ſwords
againſt the Romans without ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of their owne bloud; and ſo
by meanes of marriage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
they forgot all paſſed
enmity, and remained intimate
and hearty friends: ſuch and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other good things ought wee
aſſuredly to hope for; through
the meanes and confederacy
which God hath ordained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe two nations; for
they being linked together with
ſo firme and effectuall a knot, as
<pb facs="tcp:57128:142"/>
matrimony, we may be ſure that
Spaine having matched her
daughter with the ſonne of
France they will quite forget all
enmities, rancors, &amp; hatreds, as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
have troubled their peace
and quiet, to their great wrong,
and dimunition of the renowne
which they might have gotten
if they had agreed; and will u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
themſelves, with ſuch indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble
and firme amity, that
there ſhall not be ſeen any ſigne
or ſhadow of what is paſt; and
their wils will be ſo well ordered
and diſpoſed, that neither of
them will have any more intent
to attempt warre, perſecution,
breach of faith, or any other
manner of deceit againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
each of them binding their
hands to their girdles for feare
<pb facs="tcp:57128:142"/>
of doing hurt, and harming their
owne bloud: moreover none
can imagine but that by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
the antipathy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
which was, will be quite
extinguiſhed, and ended; ſeeing
that marriage in all reſpects both
of law and reaſon, ought to bee
more powerfull and effectuall in
ſubjects that are ſo noble, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
prudent, Chriſtian, and
fearing God, as theſe two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are, then amongſt barbarous,
heathen, and idolatrous people,
as the Sabines and the Romans
were; whereby all thoſe who are
well affected to theſe two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
may aſſuredly promiſe
themſelves and hope for ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and compleat a peace, and
agreement, as the like hath not
been ſeen in the world, with all
<pb facs="tcp:57128:143"/>
the fruits and properties that
from it (as proceeding from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)
may or ought lawfully to be
hoped for. In ſo happy a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
I contemplate the ſupreame
and extraordinary love that God
hath ſhewed to theſe two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
giving unto them the ſame
meanes &amp; manner for peace and
union, as hee himſelfe tooke,
when he was moſt at enmity
with the world: not onely Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
but others alſo know the
continuall warre and enmity
which was between God and
man before the incarnation of
the word; they employing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in nothing elſe but in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
him, with all the ſinnes
and wickedneſſe as they could,
neither feare, nor ſhame, nor any
thing elſe being able to refraine
<pb facs="tcp:57128:143"/>
their diſordered appetites; and
theſe ſins were ſo great, that there
could not be five righteous men
found in Sodom, no nor one
to ſtay the vengeance of heaven;
but mans nature was ſo corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and depraved, that God ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their wickedneſſes and ſins,
ſaid in Geneſis, <hi>poenitet me feciſſe
hominem:</hi> not that he repented,
for he being exceeding perfect,
was uncapable of griefe, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
change, or imperfection,
but it was as if he had ſaid: I ſee
humane nature ſo diſobedient,
ungratefull, and bent to evill,
that were I capable of repenting
I ſhould repent that I had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it: ſo that at that time men
did ſo obſtinately contemne
Gods commandements, that
they offended him without any
<pb facs="tcp:57128:144"/>
care, and on the other ſide God
was extreame ſevere and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in puniſhing of faults;
which the names that were
then given him in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may witneſſe, calling him
the God of armies, the God of
vengeance, the ſtrong, rigorous
and ſevere God: which titles
were accompanied with the fury
of his power, as it was ſeen in the
generall Deluge of the world, in
the fire which deſcended from
heaven to puniſh Sodome, in the
number of the Jewes which hee
cauſed <hi>Moſes</hi> to kill when they
worſhipped the Calfe, in the four
hundred yeares that he kept his
people in ſlavery in Egypt, in the
number of the Egyptians which
he drowned in the red Sea: and
infinite other examples which
<pb facs="tcp:57128:144"/>
the Scriptures teach us; ſo that
God doth nothing but puniſh,
and men nothing but offend. So
that ſeeing hee had created man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
to ſave it, and his divine
goodneſſe being more inclined
to mercie, and love, then to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and crueltie, hee tooke
pitty and compaſſion upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, and determined to
make a peace, by meanes of
the moſt glorious and admirable
marriage as could be conceived;
which was to marry his Sonne,
the Divine Word, unto our
Daughter, humane Nature, and
to unite himſelfe with it ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally
and perfectly, that
hee never left it, nor will ever
leave it (as great <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſaith)
by which conſederacie and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaticall
union our nature was
<pb facs="tcp:57128:145"/>
ſo extolled and favoured, that it
ſurpaſſed the ſpirituall degree of
Angels, from whoſe greatneſſe,
(as wee have ſaid) the firſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
tooke an occaſion to rebell
againſt his Creator. By meanes
of this divine &amp; ſupream league,
Gods juſtice and divine wrath
was converted into mercie and
compaſſion: Mercie and Truth
(as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) meeting, and
Peace and Juſtice giving each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſweet kiſſes: Yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in man an Obligation of
never offending God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to ſerve him; taking as a
motive thereunto, Gods extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
mercie and clemencie
ſhewed to Man, in eſpouſing
himſelfe to humane nature our
daughter: ſo that in offending
him, beſides the diſloyalty and
<pb facs="tcp:57128:145"/>
ungratefulneſſe wee ſhew, wee
doe alſo offend our owne bloud
and nature; And by this ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
union was God moved to
uſe ſinners mercifully, ſtaying
the rigour and puniſhment, by
reaſon of the matrimony which
his Sonne contracted with our
Nature, holding it for a certaine,
that this great Advocate which
we have in heaven with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is Chriſt, doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
forgiveneſſe for our ſinnes:
and in conſideration of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
the everlaſting Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes
thoſe favours and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
upon us which we feel eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that holy King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>David,</hi> when hee implored the
Divine favour, was alwayes
wont to ſay, <hi>Protector noſter, aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
<pb facs="tcp:57128:146"/>
Deus, reſpice in faciem Chriſti
tui.</hi> As if hee had plainly ſaid,
God of my ſoule! my ſtay, my
protector, and only refuge, look
on me with the eyes of thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
mercie; but doe not looke
immediately upon me: for thou
ſhalt ſee nothing but ſinnes, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
diſobediences, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes,
which will provoke
thee to wrath and anger; but
caſt thine eyes upon thy Sonne:
for ſeeing him wedded to my
nature, queſtionleſſe thou wilt
bee moved to mercie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.
Finally, with this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
league, God remedied
the enmity which was betweene
man and him, and left man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with eternall peace and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
All this may in ſome ſort
bee ſeene by the heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb facs="tcp:57128:146"/>
which God hath made
betweene theſe two Nations,
which hee hath of his infinite
mercie protected; it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and ſure, that they being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
by divine meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
they ſhall live in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
peace, and continuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
triumphing over their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and leaving unto poſterity
memorable enterprizes, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Nobleneſſe and Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</p>
