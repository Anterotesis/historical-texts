            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Am perſwaded there are none, though but mean Artiſts, that will queſtion the worth of the Art of Gunnery, being foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the two principal Pillars of the Mathematicks, <hi>viz.</hi> Arithmetick and Geometry. For by this Art, and good Artiſts, the Artillery hath gained Battels, Towns, Caſtels, Citadels and Forts; yea, the ſtrong Trenches of a ſtrong Army forced, opened and ſtormed by the weaker Army, to the ruine of the Intrenched Forces; which was ſeen at the Battel of <hi>Lutzen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel was at <hi>Lutzen</hi> in <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1631.</note> where the Serene and Potent <hi>Guſtavus Adolfus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was killed; for there the Swedes Gunners did ſo artifically ply their Ordnance, that the Swedes Army ſtormed the Imperialiſts in the moſt ſecure Trenches that could be made, and a ſtronger Army within than thoſe without; and only by the Artificial and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Carriage of the Gunners. By which you may perceive, that there is as much lieth on the uſing of the Ordnance, either by Sea or Land, to the ſafety of the Ship, Gariſon, or Army, and annoyance of the Enemy, as upon any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>In this little Peece you may find the framing thoſe Draughts, the Calculating thoſe Tables for Powder and Ball, and laying out thoſe Height-Rules both for Powder and Shot, with the True Wind of every Gun, with the Dimenſions of their Fortifications, in giving Powder, not having regard at all to the Weight of the Peece; further, as for the Draught of the Ordnance, likewiſe what is uſeful to a Gunner either by Sea or Land, and how the Gunner may lay or level his Peece to ſhoot at a Mark; alſo ſeveral Queſtions, a Gunner ought to give ſome account of ere he be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: As alſo to uſe his Mortar-Peece and Pattard, with Fire-Works Offenſive and Defenſive; Whereby I am perſwaded, any that will take notice of the uſe of the Quadrant and Quadrat, and Obſervations thereon, will find as Artificial Recreations in this little Peece, as in any hath been written hitherto on this Subject.</p>
            <p>It is viſible, the great harm that cometh by breaking of Guns in firing, is the ignorance of thoſe Gunners, and the great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
<pb facs="tcp:51545:6"/>
of Powder; for if a True-Fortified Peece of Ordnance ſhall have to <hi>9</hi> 
               <abbr>lb</abbr> Ball <hi>7</hi> 
               <abbr>lb</abbr> of Powder; the Queſtion is, What ought to be given to a Reinforc'd Peece ſhooting the ſame Ball? This and other ſuch Buſineſſes moved me to write, that thereby Gunners might be more circumſpect.</p>
            <p>I have not done this, that thereby I may add any thing to the Artificial Gunner, but that the younger Brethren may, by reading and obſerving what is here made plain, learn to do their Duty.</p>
            <p>If this Peece do inſtruct any yet ignorant, I ſhall be glad; if it pleaſe the Readers fancy I have content; but if it diſpleaſe any critical obſtinate Maliguer of the Art, I ſhall take no more notice of him, but deſire he may amend himſelf and this alſo: Nevertheleſs conclude as thou findeſt, and conſider the good will of</p>

            <head>AN INTRODUCTION TO THE GUNNER, For his better Underſtanding.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are many who do intrude, and alſo that have obtained the preferment to be Gunners, either of Gariſons or Ships, who never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood any the meaneſt or leaſt Article (as I may ſay) in the Gunners A, B, C.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak not this to diſcourage any from ingaging in the employment of a Gunner; But I am ſure, except he be qualified with the Principles and Ground-Rules of Gunnery, he cannot be worthy of the place. And yet there is more than Art or Action to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ere they begin: For which cauſe I will here begin with thoſe Qualifications, that a Man profeſſing, and dignified with the truſt of a Gunners place, ought to have.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That he be one that feareth God more than his Enemy.</item>
               <item>2. That he be educated, and expert in his Profeſſion: for Experience confirmeth, ſome ſay, teacheth Art.</item>
               <item>3. That he be Conſtant, and not given to change.</item>
               <item>4. That he be Faithful, True, and Honeſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51545:7"/>The Reaſon, wherefore my firſt Diſcourſe is of Gunners, is only becauſe many times it falleth out, that moſt Men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for Gunners are very negligent of the fear of God. Many Examples of this nature might be alledged and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the ſad experience of preceding times: But I thought good to intimate only this one, for the terrifying of all God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and the confirming all Godly Gunners: Which Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I had from <hi>Seyger van Reghterne,</hi> General of the Land of <hi>Overyſſel,</hi> in his Diurnal from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>; the which Diurnal begun on the 8th day of <hi>December,</hi> in the year 1628, from <hi>Texel,</hi> and ended there at his return the 12th of <hi>July</hi> 1633. In the 38th Folio of that Book, he ſaith, That in the year of our Lord 1631, in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> There was on the Iſland <hi>Nero,</hi> a Gunner, whoſe Name was <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Slime,</hi> but a very godleſs and prophane Man, who at no time could ſpeak but he would be Curſing or Swearing; and when any would ask him what was his hopes after this Life were ended, his Anſwer was, It may be to Heaven, or it may be to Hell; but, ſaid he, if I do go to Hell, there I will ſell Tobacco and Brandy, and that would be good Medicine for the Devils. But one day this <hi>Cornelius Slime,</hi> in preſence of my Author and many more, being Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Swearing, and many times giving himſelf to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; In the mean time, in preſence of all thoſe People, the Devil lift him up in the Air, and let him fall to the Ground, with a great noiſe; but the ſecond time being taken up by the Devil, he was carried where never Man living could find him: From the like the Lord deliver us all. But if Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had not taught me, both in this Country and others, what the lives of many Gunners are, I would have ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it here.</p>
            <p>Now for the Education of Gunners in their Profeſſion, it was manifeſt that there were not any of the Gunners im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Officers of the Army, in our King's and Countries Service, all the while his Majeſty was in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which were capable of their Duty, or knew any thing of Art; and it was no wonder to ſee our common Gunners ſo ſlothful to at attain to perfection in Art, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if there had been a Man able in his Profeſſion, our Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Artillery would not employ him, leſt he ſhould ſee,
<pb facs="tcp:51545:7"/>
and ſo reveal their own Inſufficiency. Likewiſe they needed not care what their Abilities were, for thoſe that had charge over them, durſt not put them to examination, for fear their own inſufficiency ſhould be openly known; but if they were able to put them to it, we might expect to be better Maſters of this Art, when now we are ſcarce good Scholars. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when there were Able Men in the Country, they could have no Employment; and for fear they ſhould be employed, there was one Calumnie or another raiſed to their prejudice; either he is proud, or a Malignant, which was in effect, he was a true Subject, and therefore not to be employed; and any of theſe two Names were enough to keep him from employment; or if he was in Service, to cauſe him to be Caſhiered, as the Caſe then ſtood.</p>
            <p>But to encourage Ingenious Spirits to ſtudy Art, and to practiſe the ſame, Remark what is ſaid of the Emperor <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi> That he was ſo skilful in ſhooting, that let a Boy a good diſtance off hold up his Hand, and ſtretch forth his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and he would ſhoot through betwixt his Fingers with an Arrow, and not touch the Boy. Now I am ſure, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the like may not be done with any great Piece of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, yet I have ſeen one, who ſhooting with a great Peece, within Point Blank of the ſame Peece, after Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Tryal of that Peece, would ſhoot within a hand-breadth of any Mark; yea, ſet a Drinking-Cup on the end of a Pike, he would take it with a Ball. And becauſe I have been both at Field, and Sea-Service, and have ſeen ſuch Errors in Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, my deſire is, That thoſe that are in Place, or ſhall come to it, may exerciſe themſelves, and ſtudy to better their own Credit, and act ſomething for the benefit and good of their Country, and honour of their King.</p>
            <p>As for the Conſtancy of Gunners, and others; Hath it not been ſeen, ſince the beginning of thoſe comfortleſs Troubles in theſe Nations, the unconſtancy and inſtability of Men, how they have varied from the one Party to the other? yea, they have for Ambition, and greedineſs of Gain, fled from the Army they have been ſworn to, and gone to the Enemy, to the great loſs of their own Souls, and hazard of the Truth, and an undoubted advantage to the Enemies of his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>For their Honeſty, they are not ſo much to blame as thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:51545:8"/>
that have the charge of them; for were they drawn to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what they receive, and how they have ſpent it, then Men durſt not but be honeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">All the Powder I ſpent in the Caſtle, I weighed, and found every Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel to lack <hi>10</hi> or <hi>12,</hi> and ſome <hi>14</hi> pound.</note>But the Commiſſary taking from each Barrel 10 or 12 pound weight of Powder, the Gunner finding this, muſt be let ſlip with as much; and I think 20 or 24 pound in the hundred, is a large Intromiſſion. <hi>Probatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to help this great, and I may ſay, terrible Theft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt King and Country; And that the Amunition may redound to the profit of the Country, which is the only Service his Majeſty requires: Chuſe honeſt Men for Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and Keepers of the Magazine, who will require an exact Account of what is gone or ſpent, and let every Man be content with his Wages. It is a true ſaying, and the Word of God clears it, <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the Children of God,</hi> Mat. 5.9. Wherefore every Man ought with all their Hearts, to cry to God for Peace with Truth, the which I pray God to ſend us.</p>
            <p>To any vers'd in Military Affairs, is known the great Gain or Loſs which may redound, either to the Country, Army, or Fleet, by the well or bad management of the Great Ordnance, or Train of Artillery; for which cauſe, I ſay, it is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to try ſuch Men you chuſe to be Gunners ere ye truſt, either for Land or Sea-Service: And if they be qualified with theſe forenamed Marks, then are they fit to act the part of a Man: But it is God by whom increaſe muſt come.</p>
            <p>Now if there ſhould chance a Man of good Qualifications to be admitted for a Gunner, and but meanly expert: To them I ſay, If they follow theſe following fundamental Rules, and digeſted Inſtructions, which I calculated in the year 1648, and 1651, I hope they ſhall have pleaſure and profit.</p>
            <p>As it is without all queſtion or contradiction, that there is nothing more Holy, more profitable or neceſſary than a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Condition; for Peace is the neareſt thing to God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard where Peace is, there is Love, Charity, Faith, and all the Virtues: Therefore we ought to pray for Peace, that ſo living in obedience to God, our King and Rulers, we may proſper in this World, and live in Bliſs eternally.</p>
            <p>But in regard that the great Princes of the World may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and ſeek Peace, we ought to pray, That as God hath
<pb facs="tcp:51545:8"/>
placed them in Power, ſo he may direct them in all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to do nothing contrary to his Glory, or the good of their Subjects. For what diviſion amongſt the Kings and Princes in Chriſtendom, hath done to the deſtruction of Religion, effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Blood, and ruining of their Eſtates, is much in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories made plain: And what hath been done by our unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diviſions within theſe three Kingdoms, is yet freſh in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, to the great grief of many good Chriſtians. And in regard that ſome Princes in Chriſtendom are forced to keep War, for maintaining of the Chriſtian Faith againſt Turks, Saracens, and barbarous Tartars; As alſo that amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſome are either blown up with Pride, or Envy, who would Reign alone, much amuſing the minds of Men what they intend to do; ſo that War is as like to be as ever: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any well-wiſhing Perſon ought to ſtudy for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Kings Honour, and good of his Country.</p>
            <p>Now what may be the Actions done by great Ordnance in time of War, may be thought either needleſs or hurtful: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing thereby to be taught, but to Raſe down Fortifications, and other Strengths to ruine: Or how an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by cutting off the Souldiers, may be ſhattered and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and an intrenched Leaguer may be broken up and forced.</p>
            <p>Truly ſuch Men ought to be in eſteem, if we will have any reſpect to theſe dangerous Times wherein we live, they ought to be encouraged; becauſe no Potentate can be longer in Peace than his Neighbour pleaſeth; and that ſcarce any ſtrength is able to reſiſt the fury of terrible Cannon well managed.</p>
            <p>And amongſt all Arms in time of War the great Ordnance is firſt in uſe, whether it be againſt, or in a beleaguered Place; and eſpecially when they are rightly managed with diſcretion, they are both helpful and encouraging to their Party.</p>
            <p>And contrary, when they are not Men of Judgment and Diſcretion, but ſlothful, and ignorant, then they produce dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the owner of them. For, as Hiſtory declares, the great Ordnance hath been the only Winners of the Battel ſometimes, and great Victory, when they have been well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, while the oppoſite Party gave their Ordnance only the blame of their flight, becauſe they were not well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb facs="tcp:51545:9"/>
               <head>What a Gunner ought to be, to whom the Charge is committed, and what he ought to know.</head>
               <p>As it is neceſſary in all Fortified Places, as well in time of Peace as of War, to have able practiſed Gunners, who are able to give an account with reaſon, of the things belonging to their Charge, and that they be ſuch as fear God more than their Enemy; they ought to be honeſt, and not given to change, as afore is ſaid.</p>
               <p>The Gunner ought, beſides his true ſhooting, to be learned in Arithmetick and Geometry, which will cauſe him give advice where a Strength may be moſt conveniently battered, and what Ordnance is moſt fitting to accompliſh the ſame.</p>
               <p>Alſo he ought to give Directions to the Engineer, what form of Batteries is moſt convenient at ſuch and ſuch places: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that by his Art he give directions that a Storm be made, where his Party may have the leaſt harm by his playing with Ordinance upon the places where danger is to be feared: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if in a Beleaguered Place, the Gunner is to defend the ſame againſt oppoſition of the Enemy, and to order ſo, as by the aſſiſtance of the Ordnance, and by what other means he can, to oppoſe and deſtroy the Enemy for defence of the Place.</p>
               <p>But before all things, and before the Army approach to the Place, to which the Prince, General, or other Officer who commands in chief, do intend to beleaguer or take; It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the experienced Gunner be one to go before, and view the Place, with the Grounds thereby; the which to do, is beſt in the breaking of the day in the morning, to know if the Walls be ſtrong or weak, and how and by what means they may be brought down; as likewiſe to find if that Fort or Gariſon be ſo Fortified, as to annoy the Ground, or what part thereof is moſt ſecure for the Army to lay down Leaguer; and what Ground is beſt to annoy the Enemy moſt in the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and alſo what place of the Walls thereof is beſt to Batter and Storm, and which way moſt ſecure to bring the Scaling Ladders to ſet up; and to know if there be any Mount, Steeple, or high Building within that is Fortified, to over-look the Leaguer; for by ſuch means great harm may occur, (or near the Leaguer) where the Enemy may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
<pb facs="tcp:51545:9"/>
and relieve the Beſieged, and ſo cauſe the Leaguer to riſe; except the Ordnance in the Leaguer be capable preſently to diſorder and deface the ſame, that after the Leaguer is intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, it may be defended by Ordnance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then he muſt know if the Ground be diggable, and on what ſide of the Leaguer the Proviant may be beſt and moſt ſecurely brought in, and what freſh Water is there-about for their relief within command of the Leaguer-place: So when it is known where, on what end of the place or ſide the Great Ordinance muſt be placed, and lie from or in the Leaguer, then muſt the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries be drawn out and meaſured; and becauſe it is hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous to work on a Plain, to break Ground before an Enemy, but there muſt Blinds be raiſed, ſome muſt be where you are not to work, as well as where you intend to build your Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries: But if you be on ſuch Ground where you muſt begin your Approach at a diſtance, then you muſt know at what diſtance you may with conveniency break Ground to run your Trenches for Approach; and as it is certain the Point-Blank Diſtance of a Peece of Ordnance is 220, 230, 240, 250 Geometrical Paces, which is alſo the diſtance of a Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot; Therefore the knowing Gunner ought to give the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men order, if there be no other Engineer for the Effect; and in this regard the Gunner ought to be acquainted in Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this, as well as for his Batteries and Ordnance placing: For if one would begin an Approach, then he muſt chuſe out ſo many Souldiers uſed to Work, as may be able to defend themſelves and reſiſt a Sally, if any be: Not neglecting to have Parties both of Horſe and Foot about the Ground to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them; in regard they are to carry, beſides their ordinary Arms, Shovels, Pickaxes, Gavelocks, Crows, and what is neceſſary for their Work. At the place commanded to break Ground, it is fitting to caſt up a Redoubt or two, from whence the Trenches are to begin; and run the Approaches, that if any ſuddain Aſſault come, the Workmen may retire thereto and defend themſelves, and work till they have aſſiſtance: for if the Workmen had no place of preſent retreat, they would be forced to run and leave their Work, Tools, and Arms to the Enemy. To this purpoſe it is to be obſerved, That the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Gunner, or Engineer, who is employed in this Work, is to uſe all the Art, Skill, and Experience they have, to run
<pb facs="tcp:51545:10"/>
their Lines in ſuch ſort, that thoſe which are in the Trenches and Approaches may not be diſcovered and ſeen by the Enemy, ſo that with ſafety and expedition they may approach near the place, or part of the Fortreſs, which the General deſires to become Maſter of.</p>
               <p>For now in our Modern Fortifications, there are but two parts in a Town, or Fortreſs, of which one muſt be battered if they mind to take it in; and theſe are either a Bulwork or Curtain.</p>
               <p>When the General or Commander of the Field, by advice of the Council of War, hath reſolved either to batter a Bulwork or Curtain, the Gunner or Engineer being preſent at the breaking of Ground, is to ſhew and inform the Workmen how they are to run their Line, and, as the occaſion preſents, of divers lengths; for they muſt be turned at every juſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is moſt neceſſary. When the Line is laid out and marked, the Workmen muſt be divided and placed in order, that one may not hinder another: Then to give to every Workman the length of 4, 5, or 6 foot, and then begin they to haſten into the Ground, for to avoid the danger which they are expoſed to, while they ſtand upon the Earth; Therefore the Earth which they dig, they caſt up before them, and as faſt as can be make a Hole like a Grave; ſo when they have dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged three foot in the Ground, and three foot broad, then ſure they are covered, ſince from their Baſis to the top of the Caſt-up-Work there are ſix foot: When they are under Covert, then they enlarge and deepen the Approaches as they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: Obſerve, they need not be ſo deep at the beginning as near to the Fortreſs; ſometimes the Trenches muſt be made ſo broad, as that the Canons and Wagons of Proviſion muſt be drawn to the Batteries or Galleries. Theſe Works are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily begun in the Night, ſo when the Night is gone, there are freſh Men ſent to relieve the firſt, and enlarge the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and amend what they could not ſee wrong. After this Nights Work, or the ſame, there are Corps of Guard made to contain Souldiers for a Main Guard, which Work ought to be with a Line of Communication with the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, though they be at a diſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> four or five paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. When one Line is finiſhed as above-ſaid, and that it muſt be run no further that way, the Gunner or Engineer
<pb facs="tcp:51545:10"/>
turns it another way, bearing it from the Town or Fort, and placing the Workmen as aforeſaid, and ſo continuing by Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Windings, till he hath got ſomething near the place or Fort beſieged, and making good the Line continually with Corps of Guards and Batteries, until they be at the brim or ſide of the Moat or Ditch of the Fort: Then is the Gunner or Engineer ſo to order his buſineſs, as to begin a Sape or Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, or Mine under the Ground, directing his Courſe by his Compaſs: as if Impediment of Rocks happen to ſtop his Courſe intended; he may make ſuch Lines and Angles about the ſame, as may bring him to his direct Line again; no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to it, but a Mariners Traverſe by croſs Winds at Sea.</p>
               <p>But for the effectuating of a Mine, there muſt be proviſion made of divers things neceſſary thereunto; as Shovels, Spades, Pickaxes, and all kind of Maſon-Tools, with all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to pierce a Wall, wherewith the Rampier is made: Then one prepares Props to ſupport and bear up the Mine from falling or ſinking, being thick and long, as is requiſite; Likewiſe you muſt have ſtore of Fir-Planks to line the Mine within that it may not fall down, for it muſt all be lined if the Ground be fruſh or brittle.</p>
               <p>Before you begin to make a Mine, it will be requiſite you know the Ground of the place, whether it be vaulted or not, or on what the Foundation thereof is laid: The Miners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to break into a Wall, are to carry their Mine as cloſe and ſecret as may be, that the Beſieged may not hear any noiſe, or get any notice where the Mine is made, and how it runs; for if they do, queſtionleſs they will make a Contra-Mine or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe above Ground, to diſcover and ſpoil your Mine begun; ſo that failing, you cannot force the Beſieged that way, except you begin a new Mine in another place: Such as was at the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Maſter-Gunner or Engineer that conducts a Mine, ought to be a Man of good Experience, leſt he miſcarry in his Traverſe; for which cauſe, he ought to be well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Mariners Compaſs, and alſo with the Variation thereof; for if there be a Mineral of Iron Ore in that Ground, it is like the Compaſs will vary, and ſo miſcarry the Mine: He ought alſo, for his Lines of Traverſe, to be acquainted
<pb facs="tcp:51545:11"/>
with the Line of Chords, or Plain-Scale; otherways with the uſe of the Protractor, for directing his Courſe and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in the Mine, that he miſtake not himſelf either in his Courſe or Diſtance, Altitude or Profunditude, according to the Ground he works in, and the Foundation of the Rampart. When the Mine is brought to the entry of the place where the Chamber muſt be: Sometimes order may be given to blow the Rubbiſh into the Fort beſieged, or it may be out, into the Moat or Ditch; either which may be done by making the ſide thinner, which they would break to, than the other: And our Experience is ſufficient proof of this, either in Cannon or Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet; for if you load a Peece of Ordnance, that there be a greater weight put after the Powder than in reaſon, give fire to the Touch-hole, and you will find that Peece fly out either at Side or Breech.</p>
               <p>The proportion of Chambers are as various as the Wall or Rampart which they are to deface, therefore can have no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion, but they muſt be made ſo large as to contain Powder ſufficient. Some would preſcribe Rules for a Barrel of Powder to blow up a Rod of Earth; but the Earth being of various ponderoſity, and ſome ſo much ſtronger bound than others, that I ſuppoſe they muſt uſe rather more than leſs Pouder; yet the Chamber would not be made larger than to contain the quantity of Powder ordained to open that Breach.</p>
               <p>When an Enemy hath beſieged a Place, Citadel, Fort, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, or other Fortification, and hath approached to Batteries; certainly it behoves the Beſieged to look about them, and to do their utmoſt endeavour to hinder the Enemy. The Defence againſt theſe Approaches is, to ſtrive to make ſome Contre-Approaches; which may be done by ſtoutly ſallying out, but withal, to ſally out with diſcretion, for fear of loſing Men, which is to be expected; (but no <hi>Dondaſs</hi> for Governour, who would neither permit ſally, nor great Gun or Muſquet to be fired againſt the Enemy): by which ſallying, the leaſt offence you do the Enemy, is to hinder the progreſs of their Approaches; for if they be beat back, and conſtrained to fly into their Works, for ſo long as the Alarm endureth, they cannot advance their Work, nor begin again to work till the Beſieged be retreated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:51545:11"/>Likewiſe this manner of Defence may be made by Cannon, which may play from all places upon the Workers of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, to do them what harm imaginable, which may put the Workmen in fear, by ſeeing their Fellows miſerably ſlain by the <note n="*" place="margin">By firing ſix Cannon together over the Mine at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Caſtle, it fell in.</note> Cannon, which may be a means to make them leave working till there be Batteries made againſt the Beſieged.</p>
               <p>The Contre-Approaches, by which you reſiſt an Enemy, that they may not become Maſters of your Outworks, or Contre-ſcarf, with their Approaches; Theſe Contre-Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to hinder the Enemy in their approach, are made by caſting up ſome <note n="†" place="margin">By the Traverſe I came to the Hole.</note> Traverſes, as I did at the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> againſt the Approaches of that Rebellious Army, running them ſo, as to find the Enemies Mines; Theſe Lines of this Traverſe muſt be caſt up toward the Enemy, but left open to the Beſieged, or Gariſon, becauſe by them they muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: This Traverſe muſt be ſo made, that it give no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Enemy if they take them in; and be ſure they may be flanked both with Cannon and Muſquet from the Fort or Gariſon.</p>
               <p>So that as there is an Offenſive War, there is alſo a Defenſive War, as doth appear by Mines; for the Beſieged having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them, and got into them, may lawfully kill the Miners: Now when the Beſieged have found the Mine out, it is to be known how they may make the way clear before them, and either kill the Miners, or make them fly, without having the leaſt harm.</p>
               <p>After the cauſing a Hole fall in their Mine, near to my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, I prepared a Powder-Barrel, with old Rope-yarn, Mens Dung dry about the Walls, Powder-Meal'd, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and Verdigreaſe, with Camphire; all which being mixed together, I cauſed to be put in the Mine, which made <note n="*" place="margin">Then Governor of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Overton</hi> and all flie: So we entred peaceably, and brought thereout their Working Tools without any harm.</p>
               <p>For the Gunners further knowledg, that is yet in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, this Work is begun with <hi>Decimal Arithmetick,</hi> which is very uſeful in the Art of Gunnery, the Working and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of the Square and Cube Roots; as alſo ſome Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Problems of Geometry: by which the Gunner may the better make uſe of his Compaſſes, for which he will have
<pb facs="tcp:51545:12"/>
ſeveral needful uſes; for the whole Matter, I know little in this Book that may be wanting in a Gunner, that may be called a ſufficient Gunner. In fine know, that I ſhall be glad that every Gunner may profit by it, and I wiſh that ſome may amend it. However know, that I intend this for your profit and the publick Good; for if I had not ſeen need, I would never have taken the pains, nor been at the Charges; but (underſtand me right) no Pains can exceed the Duty we owe to our King and Native Country.

               </head>
               <p>DIviſion, whether in pure Decimals, or Integers mixt with Decimals, is the ſame in Operation with Diviſion in Integers. But care muſt be had to give a true denomination to the firſt Figure of the Quotient; (according to this Rule).</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The Rule.</label>The firſt Figure of the Quotient is always of the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination with that place of the Dividend, which ſtands, or is ſuppoſed to ſtand over the Unite of the Diviſor.</p>
               <p>It will happen ſometimes, that the Unite place of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor will ſtand beyond all the ſignificant Figures of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend, towards the right hand, or towards the left. In this caſe you muſt put Ciphers to the right or left of the Dividend, until you come over the Unite place of the Diviſor.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>As for Example.</label>If 3<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>47 is to be divided by 0<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>000462, they muſt ſtand thus; 0<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>000462) 0003<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>47 (And the denomination of the firſt Figure of the Quotient will be thouſands of Integers.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Another Example.</label>If 34 is to be divided by 642<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>79, they muſt ſtand thus; 642<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>79) 34<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>0000 (And the denomination of the firſt Figure of the Quotient will be hundreds of Decimals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That what Ciphers are added to the right hand of the Dividend, immediately next the Integers muſt have a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Line (or a <hi>Comma</hi>) before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:51545:15"/>In Diviſion, the Fractions being equal, the Work is as whole Numbers are.</p>
               <p>If unequal, add ſo many Ciphers to the Dividend, as the Fraction of the Diviſor exceedeth the Fraction of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend in places, that you may find your Fraction in the Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
               <p>

                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Becauſe the Fraction is two Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in the Diviſor; Therefore I add two Ciphers to the Dividend. As in this third Example.</p>

               <p>TO prepare a Cube Number for Extraction, put a Point over the firſt place thereof towards the right hand, (to wit, the place of Unites); then paſſing over the ſecond and third places, put another point over the fourth; and paſſing over the fifth and ſixth, put another over the ſeventh, and in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51545:18"/>
that order, (to wit, two places being intermitted between every two adjacent Points) place as many Points as the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber will permit: So 157464 being given, you are to place the Points as here followeth; and ſo many Points as are in that manner placed, of ſo many Figures the Root demanded will conſiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Having thus prepared your Number,  you may ſee it diſtributed by the Points into ſeveral Cubes: So in the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample 157 is the firſt Cube, and 464 the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Find the Simple Cube Root by the preceding Table of 157, which is 5; ſubſcribe the Cube of that Root under the firſt Cube of the Number given; ſo 125 being the Cube of 5 the Root, I write it under 157 the firſt Cube of the Number given, and ſubtract this Cube from the firſt Cube of the Number pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, placing the remainder orderly underneath the Line: So 125 the Cube of 5 being ſubtracted from 157, the remainder is 32: to the ſaid remainder, bring down the next Cube of the Number pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, (to wit, the Figures or Ciphers which ſtand in the three next places) placing the ſaid Cube next after, to wit, on the right hand of the remainder; ſo the next Cube 464 being placed after the remainder 32, there will be found the Number 32464, which may be called the Reſolvend. Having drawn a Line under the Reſolvend, ſquare the Root in the Quotient, that is, multiply it by it ſelf, and ſubſcribe the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the ſaid Square or Product, under the Reſolvend, in ſuch manner, that the firſt place (to wit, the place of Unites) of the ſaid triple Square, may ſtand directly under the third place (or place of hundreds) in the Reſolvend: So the Square of the Root 5 is 25, the Triple whereof is 75, which I ſubſcribe under the Reſolvend in ſuch manner, that the Figure 5, which is in the firſt place, (to wit, the place of Unites) in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Product 75, may ſtand under 4, which is ſeated in the third place of the Reſolvend. Triple the Root or Number in the Quotient, and ſubſcribe this Triple Number in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51545:19"/>
that the firſt place thereof, (to wit, the place of Unites) may ſtand directly under the ſecond place (to wit, the place of Tens) in the Reſolvend: So the triple of the Root 5 is 15, which I ſubſcribe in ſuch manner, that the Figure 5, which is in the firſt place (to wit, the place of Unites) in the ſaid triple Number, doth ſtand directly under 6, which is ſeated in the ſecond place of the Reſolvend: The triple Square of the Root, and the triple of the Root being placed one under the other as is directed, draw a Line underneath, and add them together in ſuch order as they are ſeated, and let the Sum be eſteemed as a Diviſor: So the Triple Square 75, and the triple Number 15 being added together, as they are ranked in the Work, the Sum will be 765 for a Diviſor: Let the whole Reſolvend, except the firſt place thereof towards the right hand, (to wit, the place of Unites) be eſteemed as a Dividend; then demanding how often the firſt Figure (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left hand) of the Diviſor is contained in the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent part of the Dividend, and obſerving in that behalf the Rules before taught in Diviſion, write the Anſwer in the Quotient: So I ask how often 7 (the firſt Figure of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor towards the left hand) is contained in 32, (the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent part of the Dividend placed above) the Anſwer will be 4, wherefore I write 4 in the Quotient: Having drawn another Line under the Work, multiply the triple Square be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſubſcribed by the Figure laſt placed in the Quotient, and ſubſcribe this Product under the ſaid triple Square, (to wit, Unites under Unites, Tens under Tens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) So 75 being multiplyed by 4, the Product is 300, which I ſubſcribe under 75 (the triple Square). Multiply the Figure laſt placed in the Quotient, firſt by it ſelf, and then the Product by the triple Number before ſubſcribed; this done, ſubſcribe the laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct under the ſaid triple Number, (to wit, Unites under Unites, Tens under Tens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) So 4 being ſquared or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by it ſelf, the Product is 16, which being multiplyed by the triple Number 15, the Product is 240, this therefore I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe under the aforeſaid triple Number 15. Subſcribe the Cube of the Figure laſt placed in the Quotient, under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvend, in ſuch manner that the firſt place of this Cube, (to wit, the place of Unites) may ſtand under the place of Unites in the Reſolvend: So 64 being the Cube of 4, I write it under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvend
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51545:19"/>
32464, in ſuch manner, that the Figure 4, which is in the place of Unites in the Cube 64, may ſtand under the Figure 4, which is ſeated in the place of Unites of the Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vend: Drawing yet another Line under the Work, add the three laſt Numbers together in the ſame order as they are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſubtract the Sum of them from the Reſolvend, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Remainder orderly underneath: So the Sum of the three laſt Numbers, as they are ranked in the Work, is 32464, which if you ſubtract out of the Reſolvend 32464, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder is 0. Thus the whole Work being finiſhed, the Cube Root of 157464, (the Number propounded) is found to be 54.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. When the Sum of the three laſt Numbers before mentioned is greater than the Reſolvend, the Work is errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and then you are to reform it by placing a leſſer Figure in the Quotient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 2. For every one of the particular Cubes (diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſhed by the Points) except the firſt Cube on the left hand, a Reſolvend is to be ſet apart, by bringing down to the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the next Cube. And as often as a Reſolvend is ſet apart, ſo often is a new Diviſor to be found, by adding the triple of all the Root in the Quotient (conſiſting of what number of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſoever) to the triple of the Square of ſuch Root, after they are orderly placed, according as is above-mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 3. The Work of the Table of Simple Cubes in Folio 9, for finding the firſt Figure of the Root, (as before declared) is but once uſed in the Extraction of the Root of any Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whatſoever; but the Work of all the following Rules, is to be uſed for the finding of every place in the Root except the firſt.</p>
               <p>The practice of theſe three Notes will be ſeen, when we deſcribe how to extract the Cube Root of Numbers not Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bical.</p>

                  <item>12. The Diameter of a Circle, is a Right Line drawn through the Centre thereof, and ending at the Circumference on either ſide, dividing the Circle into two equal parts: As the Line AEC in this Circle is the Diameter thereof, becauſe it paſſeth from the Point A to the Point C, and ſo likewiſe through the Centre E, and divideth the whole Circle into two equal parts.</item>
                  <item>13. The Semi-diameter being the half thereof; as AE and EC, the one Term whereof being the Centre, and the other the Circumference: It followeth by the 11<hi>th</hi> Definition hereof, that all Lines drawn from the Centre to the Circumference are equal; Therefore is BE and ED likewiſe Semi-diameters.</item>

                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51545:22"/>14. A Semi-circle is a Figure which is contained under the Diameter, and under that part of the Circumference which is cut off by the Diameter, as the Semi-circle ABC, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under the Diameter AC, and alſo under the part of the Circumference ABC, which is cut off by the Diameter AC.</item>
                  <item>15. A Quadrant is the fourth part of a Circle, or is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under two Semi-diameters, and the fourth part of the Circumference, as in the preceding Circle AEB or BEC.</item>
                  <item>16. A Segment of a Circle, is a part of the Circle contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under a Chord-Line, (not being the Diameter) and a part of the Circumference, as FBG being the leſſer Segment; and the Remainer to the whole Circle being the greater.</item>
                  <item>17. A right-lined Angle, is the Inclination, or bowing of one Line to another, which being extended, do concur or meet in a Point, as in the preceding Circle AEB or AEH, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the middle Letter ſignifying always the Angle, as E.</item>
                  <item>18. Of Right-lined Angles there be three kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> A Right-Angle, an Obtuſe or Blunt-Angle, and an Acute or Sharp-Angle.</item>
                  <item>19. A Right-Angle is that, when one Line falling upon another maketh the Angles on both ſides equal, then either of thoſe Angles is a Right-Angle: and the Right Line which ſtandeth erected, is called a Perpendicular-Line to that upon which it ſtandeth. As upon the Right-Line AC, ſuppoſe there do ſtand another Line BE, (as in the preceding Circle) in ſuch ſort, that it maketh the Angles on either ſide thereof equal, namely the Angle AEB on the one ſide, equal to the Angle BEC on the other ſide, then are each of thoſe Angles Right Angles, and the Line BE, which ſtandeth erected on the Line AC, is a Perpendicular to the ſaid Line AC.</item>
                  <item>20. An Obtuſe-Angle is that which is greater than a Right-Angle, as the Angle HEB (in the preceding Circle) is greater than the Angle AEB, by the Angle AEH, and therefore is an Obtuſe-Angle.</item>
                  <item>21. An Acute or Sharp-Angle, is that which is leſs than a Right-Angle, as the Angle AEH is an Acute-Angle, becauſe it is leſs than the Right-Angle AED, by the other Acute-Angle DEH.</item>

I Anſwer, That only Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude being to be divided into certain parts, the ſame ought to be divided into the leaſt and beſt, for dividing as in equal parts: But ſo it was, that no Number under 360 could be had, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diviſible into more equal parts; and likewiſe being a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not very troubleſom to the Memory.

As the Arches FG, DE, AC, deſcribed from the Angular Point B: So that ſo many Degrees as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in theſe Arches, ſuch is the quantity of the Angle ABC,
<figure/>
I ſay all theſe Arches being equal; not according to quantity of extenſion: for certain it is that FG will be leſſer than AC;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51545:23"/>
but I ſay that they are equal according to the number of Parts, for there are more Parts in the Arch AC than in FG, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the quantity of the one be greater than the quantity of the other; becauſe all Circles deſcribed from the ſame Centre are equal, all being divided into 360 Degrees.</p>
               <p>From hence it follows that every Angle may be meaſured by an Arch of a Circle actually divided; whether it be Semi-circle, Quadrant, or Line of Chords, (the conſtruction of which hereafter followeth); And firſt by a Semi-circle divided into 180 Degrees: Firſt, Lay the Centre of the ſame upon the Angular Point, and the Diameter upon one of the Lines for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Angle, the Degrees contained between theſe two Lines upon your Inſtrument is the meaſure of your Angle. As in this Example, The Centre of your Semi-circle placed upon the Angular Point A, and the Diameter upon AC, the Arch contained between AB and AC, ſuch is DE, which is the meaſure of the Angle DAE 36 Degrees.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="22">22. The meaſure of any Right-lined Angle, may be had by a Line of Chords, which is deſcribed upon a Ruler; which Line is virtually the Arch of a Circle; The Projection whereof is as followeth. Let there be a Quadrant, or fourth part of a Circle, as BAC, divided into 90 Degrees; Firſt, Into three parts, each containing 30 Degrees, by taking the Semi-diameter, as AB, with your Compaſſes; place one foot
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51545:24"/>
in C, and with the ſame wideneſs ſet the other foot in F; ſet again the one foot of your Compaſſes in B, (the Compaſſes not being altered) and with the other take the extent BG: So your Quadrant ſhall be divided into three equal parts, <hi>viz.</hi> CG 30 Degrees, CF 60, and the reſt unto B 90 degrees: Every one of theſe being again ſubdivided into three equal parts; ſo ſhall you have the Quadrant divided into nine parts, or 90 degrees, each part containing ten degrees: and ſo into ſmall parts according to the largeneſs of your Quadrant.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Quadrant being performed and truly divided: you ſhall draw a Line from B to C, which ſhall be the Chord of 90 degrees; again you ſhall place the one foot of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes at C, and extend the other to 10 degrees; the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention you ſhall lay off from C to D, upon the Line of Chords; ſtill keeping the one foot of your Compaſſes at C, again extend your Compaſſes to 20 degrees, and lay them off from C to E; and ſo accordingly to all the reſt, till you have finiſhed the diviſion of your Line. Which being performed, ſhall ſerve you to meaſure the quantity of all Right-lined An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, as well as by any Circular Arch; being more portable, and more ready for uſe, than any Circular Inſtrument, as Semi-circle, Quadrant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as by the following practice is evident.</p>

23. Let there be an Angle, as ABC, whoſe quantity is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired: The ſame is performed by a Line of Chords; if you place the one foot of your Compaſſes at the end of your Line, and the other upon 60 degrees; then the Compaſſes remaining at the ſame wideneſs, place the one foot at B, and draw an Arch as DE; whoſe wideneſs you ſhall take by your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, and apply the ſame to your Scale upon the Line of Chords, you ſhall have the Quantity of the Angle 36 degrees.
<figure/>
But if the Angle be Obtuſe or Blunt, as FBC, extend the Compaſſes upon your Scale to 60 degrees, drawing an Arch from the Angular Point; then firſt take off 90 degrees from your Line of Chords, and place the ſame from E to G, the remainer being taken from G to F, the diſtance whereof is 54 degrees; which two Arches being added together, ſhall give the quantity of the Angle FBC, reckoned 144 degrees. And thus much for finding the quantity of all Right-lined Angles, by the Line of Chords upon your Scale.</p>

Take the juſt Diameter of the Bore of your Peece, which you divide into two equal parts, and draw the Circle ABE; then the Compaſſes at the ſame ſtation, you place one foot in A, and another in B, and draw the Croſs Arches ACB: From C draw a Line through the Centre D to E, and then draw the Line AE: then place one foot of your Compaſſes in E, and draw the Arch AB: then place one foot of your Compaſſes in the Centre D, and extend the other to the Arch F, ſo draw the Circle FG: which he ſaith is the way to find a true Ball.</p>

                  <note place="margin">According to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in former times, the loading of Powder.</note>In Ancient times it is ſaid, That the great Chamber'd-Guns, that ſhot Stone-Ball, had for their ordinary one pound of Powder to three pound and half, or at moſt four pound weight of their Ball. This was certainly the firſt Invention of Guns; and in regard they could not caſt Iron, they made their Guns, as Coopers do Cask, with Staves of Iron and Hoopes. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that thoſe Guns that ſhot Iron-Ball, moſt have to every three pound of Iron-Ball, one pound of Powder; and this they held for a general Rule, not examining the Fortification of their Peeces. Now at this time Powder was made of all the three Ingredients equal, and therefore could not be ſtrong. But afterward it was found, that all ſort of Field-Ordnance, not being Chamber'd, but true Bored, ſhould be loaded in this manner, (to wit) The Gunner ſhall take the Diameter of the Ball, or the Diameter of the Bore of the Peece with a pair of Compaſſes; and this Diameter three times the Gunner muſt ſet off upon his Gun from the Touch-hole toward the Muſſel; which diſtance being fil'd with Powder, then, ſaid they, One pound of Powder was allowed to two pound of Ball: this was the Rule of the Primitive Gunners. But now in our time Powder is ſo variouſly made, and the difference is ſuch, that it is hardly poſſible to the beſt Judgment, to give a true Rule what Powder is ſufficient either for Proof or Action;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51545:40"/>
and therefore the Gunner ought to try his Powder before he load his Peece; for it is beyond all queſtion, that if the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be decayed, there muſt be more of it uſed than of freſh dry Powder: but if Powder be of his Majeſties Tower-Proof, as I am informed, that then the Gunner need not take near ſo much Powder to ſhoot among a party of Men, not being at a great diſtance, as the Peece would crave to batter a Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Wall, or Gate, or Ship.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the young Gunner, that is not yet experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Practice, may be taught how he ſhall load all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Guns; and that it is to be underſtood, that ordinarily thoſe that will be called Gunners, though not known in the Art, uſe to load their Guns with half the weight of the Ball of Powder; this they hold for a general Rule to all Guns, which Rule is not to be ſlighted on ſome occaſions, with true-Bored, true-Fortified Ordnance, (yet it may be ſaid, they have this by Tradition) to hold this Rule, without adding to reinforc'd Ordnance, or deducting from thoſe that are leſſened of Metal; ſo that by this they not having any other Rule, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their own nakedneſs or emptineſs of Art, for I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that no experienced Gunner, but will hold that the Gunner ought to ſearch, try, and find the Nature and Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Gun or Guns, before he do hold himſelf obliged to give a Gun Powder, and thereby to prove a true Charge of Powder for the ſame.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THeſe firſt Rules were derived from the weight of Ball; but ſince the Rules were made from the weight of the Peece: for they held generally that four ounces of Pouder was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Gunner to give a Braſs Gun, to every hundred weight for Service; and three ounces to every hundred weight of Iron Guns. Neither this nor the other being right, for I have ſeen Trumpet-bored Iron Guns of 1200 weight, that

could not have half the alowed Powder that either of theſe Rules did allow of. And likewiſe I read the Cauſe of the death of King <hi>James</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was by the breaking of a great Gun at the Siege of <hi>Rosbrugh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For theſe and the following Reaſons, I do not hold with that common received Rule, than which many Gunners know no better, but to give Ordnance Powder by the weight of the Gun. For if there be a Peece of Ordnance of Iron weighing 1600 pound weight, likewiſe there is another Peece of the ſame Bore, and of the ſame weight: Now by the Rule of weight it muſt have the like Powder.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Great Cautions to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in giving Guns Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note>But will you conſider, for your Inſtruction, this Peece is longer, and having no more Metal in her than the other, of neceſſity ſhe muſt be thinner of Metal; for what ſhe hath of the length, ſhe muſt want of her thickneſs, the Bore being both of one denomination; and ſince ſhe is thinner, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth ſhe muſt not have ſo much Powder as the other.</p>

               <p>Whilſt the Bore it ſelf is one of the Diameters, that being deduced from 3 ½, reſts 2 ½, whereby 1 ¼ is the thickneſs of that Peece in one ſide Metal; and becauſe theſe be the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Iron, by which the Ground-Rule may be and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily is laid down, to give Guns their Powder of other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications; for you muſt know that there are ſome leſſened, as thinner Fortified, and ſo cannot have the ſame proportion of Powder, though they ſhoot one and the ſame Ball: Likewiſe there are reinforc'd or thicker Ordnance at the charged Cyllin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which ſhoot the ſame Ball, and muſt have more Powder: So you may ſee that the Iron Peece is 11 Diameters of the Bore about the Breech, 9 Diameters at the Trunions, and 7 at the Neck.</p>

               <p>But thus fortified with 11 Diameters of the Bore about the Breeech, if Iron, Ordnance ſhooting from one pound Ball to 48 pound.</p>
               <p>Alſo the ſame Tables will ſerve for Braſs Ordnance, being Fortified with 9 Diameters of the Bore about the Breech, by what name ſoever you define them, ſhooting from one pound Ball, to 48 pound Ball.</p>

                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:51545:46"/>Now as theſe are the Tables for true-Fortified, and leſſened in Metal, I hold convenient to give Tables for Reinforc'd Ordnance; theſe have commonly, being Braſs, 10 Diameters of the Bore about the Breech, and Iron 12 about the Breech. And though to ſome theſe Tables may ſeem fooliſh, I have ſeen thoſe who have been eſteemed Able Gunners, that knew not how to give ſuch Guns Powder; yea, they have in my preſence wagered, and not one of them knew what they wagered concerning two ſuch Guns lying at the Head of <hi>Ferveer</hi> confer; where amongſt ſix Gunners one only underſtood to give theſe two Guns their true Powder; as at the Diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a Gentleman of the Ordnance to the States did manifeſt in favour of the one Man.<note place="margin">How many Gunners at the Wager, and but one capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I alſo have been in conteſt with one profeſſing great Art, and was a rare Perſon in Art: Yet in the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> there was a Gally-Gun of Braſs that did ſhoot 28 <abbr>lb</abbr> Ball; and thereby he did conclude that Peece to have 13 or 14 <abbr>lb</abbr> of Powder for Action: In hearing this Expreſſion I did laugh:<note place="margin">This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute was between a general Perſon and a Gunner.</note> The Gentleman was offended, and asked if I could teach him, (it was but in diſdain); I anſwered, Sir, if you know not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than you expreſs, I am ſure I am able to teach you in this point: Whereupon he went out at the Caſtle-Gate, and was ever mine Enemy from that time forth. And to ſatisfie the Reader, I will give the Dimenſions of that Peece: She was but 7 Diameters of the Bore about the Breech, and 5 ½ about the Muſle, for ſhe was plain without Rings, except the Baſe and Muſle-Rings, or Corniſh-Rings; ſo that by her Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhe could ſuffer but 6 <abbr>lb</abbr> and 13 ounces of Powder; and with ſo much I have cauſed her to be diſcharged divers times, and could do Service with this Peece,<note place="margin">What may be done with a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened peece, as if it were a Morter-Peece.</note> which could not be done with a true-Fortified Peece; for with this Peece I have ſhot over the Steeple of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the Ball hath fallen at the next Lodging where <hi>Cromwel</hi> did lie. And this I did for three times together, till our Governour diſcharged me to ſhoot any more for troubling his Friend. Therefore I ſay, An able Man may be miſtaken of a Gun, when he neither knoweth the Fortification nor Proportion how to Work to give a Peece Powder.</p>
               <p>So to avoid trouble to Artiſts for Calculating, and to inſtruct thoſe Gunners that are not capable of Calculation, I have here

                  </gap> Guns of Iron, having 12 about the Breech, and Braſs having near 10 Diameters about the Breech, and are called Reinforc'd Ordnance. The Figures following Demonſtrate the true Proportion of theſe Reinforc'd Ordnance, which require more Powder than true-Bored, true-Fortified Ordnance, as you may ſee by the Tables following; which Tables might have been firſt of all: but I obſerve that the Ground-Rule muſt be put in the firſt place; And thoſe that do take their Demenſions from it do follow, whether they be Reinforc'd or leſſened of Metal, ſuch as are formerly deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Theſe following Tables, are Tables for Reinforc'd Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which are ſuch as have more ſtrength of Fortification, and are more able to endure firing: Such as be the Baza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk, Serpents, or Slings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are good to ſhoot with at a great diſtance. Having, as I ſuppoſe, given a full account of the true allowance of Powder for all ſorts of true-Bored Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, both for Proof and Action, whether they be Braſs or Iron Guns, it followeth that the Gunner ought to know how to go to work with his Peece, when he is to apply theſe Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, by which he is to give fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Theſe Rules are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</note>Firſt, He ſhall take a piece of Twine, which is to be well waxed, as the Shoemakers do their Thread, that it do not ſtretch nor ſhrink; then meaſure the Peece about at the Touch-hole betwixt the Rings, and taking with a pair of Compaſſes the Diameter of the Bore at the Muſle, meaſure the Twine how many Diameters of the Bore is contained about the Breech of the Peece, that keep in memory. Now you are to know what Ball fits that Peece, as is plainly ſet down <hi>pag.</hi> 42. Geometrically; but may be exactly found in the Tables of Height and Weight of Shot, and in the Tables of Diameters of Bores, either Scots or Engliſh. When you have found the Diameter of the Ball, if you cannot Arithmetically find the Weight by the Diameter of the Ball, then you may reſort to the Tables for ſuch Fortifications, and next the weight of Ball you have the weight of Powder for that Peece: but you muſt be ſure your Peece muſt be true-bored, as is mentioned in <hi>pag.</hi> 58. For if the Peece be either Taper'd, Chamber'd, or Trumpet-bored, theſe Tables will do no ſervice.</p>

               </head>
               <p>FOr thoſe that cannot find the Weight of the Ball by Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, I will here ſhew them a Rule, and alſo Tables which I have Calculated, as well Decimally, as in Pounds, Ounces, and Drams, from eight parts to eight of an Inch of the Diameter of a Ball, unto 10 Inches Diameter, both in Scots and Engliſh Weight, and alſo in Scots and Engliſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for the Artificial Gunner his more eaſe.</p>
               <p>It falls out many times that the Gunner cannot find Weights and Scales to weigh his Shot; it is therefore neceſſary the Gunner ſhould know how to find the Weight of his Shot Arithmetically; as thus, If you deſire to know the weight of a Ball, whoſe Diameter is juſt Inches, without any Fraction or parts of an Inch, then you are to multiply the Diameter Cubically; then double that Product, and divide the Total by 16, you have in the Quotient the Pounds that the Ball weigheth; and what Remainer you have over, you ſhall know that Remainer is Ounces.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Example.</label>
There is a Ball of 4 Inches Diameter given, to find his Weight: The Cube of 4 is 64, which being doubled maketh 128; this 128 being divided by 16, (the ounces in a pound) the Quotient giveth 8, which is 8 <abbr>lb</abbr> of Scots Weight which that Ball doth weigh.</p>

But indeed I find nothing of ingenuity, for a Man to copy a Table from anothers Works, and never examine the Truth of the Work; But I have made uſe of their own Ground-Rule, and find not one of them to have wrought it, or ſet the Table down truly.</p>

                  </gap>Having diſtributed the Number given into ſeveral Cubes by Points, as is directed in Chap. 8. of this. I demand the  Cube-Root of 8, (the firſt Cube on the left hand) which I find to be 2; wherefore placing 2 in the Quotient, and 8 the Cube thereof, under 8 the firſt Cube, I draw a Line, ſubtracting 8 out of 8, the Remainder is 0, which I ſubſcribe under the Line. This is always the firſt Work, and is no more repeated in the whole Extraction, (as was intimated in the third Note of <hi>chap.</hi> 8.); then bringing down the next Cube, (to wit, the Figures ſtanding in the three following places of the Number propounded) which is 302, I place it after the Remainder 0, ſo is 302 the Reſolvend; this done, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drawn a Line underneath the Reſolvend, I ſeek for the triple of the Square of the Root, <hi>viz.</hi> The Root in the Quotient is 2, which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by it ſelf produceth the Square 4, the triple whereof is 12; this I ſubſcribe under the Reſolvend, in ſuch manner, that the Figure 2 in the Unites place of this triple Square 12, may ſtand directly under the Figure 3, which is ſeated in the third place of the Reſolvend, (to wit, the place of Hundreds): Again, I triple the Root 2, which produceth 6, and ſubſcribe this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Number 6 under the ſecond place (or place of Tens) in the Reſolvend, to wit, under 0; then drawing a Line under the Work, and adding together the ſaid two Numbers laſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as they are ranked, the Sum of them is 126 for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor: That done, eſteeming 30, to wit, all the places except the firſt or place of Unites in the Reſolvend, as a Dividend, I demand how often the Diviſor 126 is contained in 30, and not finding it once contained therein, I write 0 in the Quotient; and now becauſe the ſum of the three Numbers which ought
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51545:56"/>
to have been produced (according as was mentioned in Chap. 8.) by the multiplication of 0, (which was laſt placed in the Quotient) amounts to 0, the Reſolvend 302, out of which the ſaid Sum ſhould have been ſubtracted, remains the ſame without alteration; wherefore having drawn a Line un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Work, I write down anew the old Reſolvend 302, and bringing down the next Cube 348, I annex it to the ſaid 302, ſo there will be a new Reſolvend, to wit, 302348. Then ſquaring the Root 20, (that is, multiplying of it by it ſelf) the Product is 400; which I triple or multiply by 3, and ſubſcribe the Product 1200 under the new Reſolvend in ſuch manner, that the place of Unites in this triple Quadrate 1200 may ſtand under the place of Hundreds, or third place of the Reſolvend 302348, to wit, under 3: Again, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the triple of the Root 20, which is 60, in ſuch manner, that the place of Unites in this triple Root 60 may ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the place of Tens or ſecond place of the Reſolved; then adding together the two Numbers laſt ſubſcribed, to wit, 1200 and 60, in ſuch order as they are ranked in the Work, the Sum is 12060 for a Diviſor. Again, eſteeming the whole Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vend, except the firſt place, (or place of Unites) as a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend, to wit, 30234, I demand how often 1 (the firſt Figure of the Diviſor towards the left hand) is contained in 3, the coreſpondent part of the Dividend; and though it be three times contained in it, yet (according to the firſt Note in Chap. 8.) I dare take but 2; (for if I ſhould take 3, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according as was declared in Chap. 8. a Number would ariſe greater than the Reſolvend, from which ſuch Numbers ariſing ought to be ſubtracted) wherefore I write 2 in the Quotient. Then multiplying the triple Square 1200 before ſubſcribed by 2, (the Figure laſt placed in the Quotient) the Product is 2400, which I ſubſcribe under the ſaid 1200, (to wit, Unites under Unites, and Tens under Tens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Alſo multiplying the triple Root 60, before ſubſcribed by 4, (the Quadrate of 2, the Figure laſt placed in the Quotient) the Product is 240, which I ſubſcribe under the ſaid triple Root 60; laſt of all I ſubſcribe 8 the Cube of the ſaid new Root 2, under the place of Unites, or firſt place of the Reſolvend, to wit, under 8; and having added together thoſe three Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers laſt ſubſcribed, to wit, 2400, 240, and 8, as they ſtand
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51545:57"/>
in Ranks in the Work, the ſum of them is 242408, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deducted from the Reſolvend 302348, there will remain 59940. Wherefore the Work being finiſhed, I find 202 to be the number of Unites contained in the Cube-Root of 8302348 the Number propounded: and becauſe, after the Extraction is ended, there happens to be a Remainder, to wit, 59940, I conclude that the Cube-Root ſought is greater than the ſaid 202, but leſs than 203; yet how much it is greater than 202, no Rules of Art hitherto known will exactly diſcover, although we may proceed infinitely near, as by the following Rule will be manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>To find the Fractional part of the Root very near.</label>
Ternaries of Ciphers, to wit, 000,000000, or 000000000, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be annexed to the Number firſt propounded; then eſteeming the Number propounded with the Ciphers annexed to be but one entire Number, the Extraction is to be made according as hath been preſcribed in this Chapter; and look how many Points were placed over the Number firſt given, ſo many of the foremoſt places in the Quotient are the Integers or Unites contained in the Cube-Root ſought, and the reſt of the places in the Quotient are to be eſteemed as the Numerator of a Decimal Fraction; which Numerator conſiſts of ſo many places as there were Points over the Ciphers firſt annexed: ſo if 8302348 were given as before to find the Cube-Root thereof, (according to this Rule) annex Ciphers as you here ſee in the Work. And then if you proſecute the Extraction according to the Rules foregoing, you ſhall find the Cube-Root ſought to be 202<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>48, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, 202 48/100 and more; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may conclude that 202 48/100 is leſs than the true Root, but 202 49/100 is greater than it; So that by annexing two Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of Ciphers, to wit, ſix Ciphers to the number pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, you will not miſs 1/100 part of an Unite of the true Root; as alſo by annexing three Ternaries of Ciphers, to wit, 9 Ciphers, you will not miſs 1/1000 part of an Unite of the true Root; and in that order you may proceed infinitely near, when you cannot obtain the true Root. The whole Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſaid Example you have in the next page, where you may obſerve, that for the more certain and eaſie placing, as well of the Numbers, which conſtitute the ſeveral Diviſors, as of thoſe which conſtitute the Ablatitious Numbers to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted

                  <label>The Proof of the Cube-Root.</label>
The Extraction of the Cube-Root is proved by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Root Cubically; to wit, the Root being firſt multiplied by it ſelf, the Product ſhall give a Square Number, the which Square being multiplied again by the ſaid Root, the Number ariſing, or laſt Product (in caſe there be no Remainder after the Extraction is finiſhed) will be equal to the Number pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded:</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>So in the Example of Chap. 8. the  Cube-Root 54 being multiplyed firſt by it ſelf, produceth 2916, which is a Square Number, then the ſaid Square 2916, being multiplyed by the Root 54, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth 157464, which is a Cube Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber equal to the number propounded, whoſe Cube-Root was required. So that the Extraction is right, and the ſame Root found is the true Cube-Root of the Number propoſed. But when after the Extraction is finiſhed, there happens to be a Remainder, and that the Root is found as near as you pleaſe in Integers and Decimal parts, (by annexing Ciphers as in this Chapter) then ſuch mixt Number expreſſing the Root, being multiplyed Cubically, muſt produce a mixt Number leſs than the Number firſt propounded; yet ſo near unto it, that if the Figure ſtanding in the laſt place of the Decimal Fraction in the Root be made greater by 1, and the mixt number ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed be multiplied Cubically, the Product muſt be greater than the Number firſt propounded: ſo in the firſt Example of this Chapter, if 202<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>48 be multiplied Cubically, it produceth 8301305<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>49, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is leſs than the propounded Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 8302348; but if 202<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>49 be multiplied Cubically, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will ariſe 8302535<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>49, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is greater than the ſaid gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Number.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>The way to find the Diameter of the firſt pound Ball.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw if any Artificial Gunner deſire to make a Height-Rule or Scale to know the Weight of his Shot, by meaſuring the Diameter of the Ball, and by this Cubical Table: Firſt he muſt know the exact Diameter of a Ball of one pound weight, of what ſort of Metal or Stone he deſires his Height-Rule or Scale for; the which to do, obſerve theſe Rules follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Search until you find a Ball of that Metal very ſmooth, of any ſize or weight, and take the Diameter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly of that Ball, with a pair of Callabaſſero Compaſſes. Then draw that Diameter on a peece of Paper, or plain Board, and divide it in as many equal parts as you pleaſe; then weigh that Ball exactly well, which being done, multiply the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Diameter of the Ball Cubically, and divide that Product by the weight of the Ball; ſo from that Quotient of your Diviſion, you are to extract the Cube-Root, and the Quotient is the parts of that Ball which weigheth one pound weight of that Metal.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Example.</label>
The Ball given is a Ball of Iron, whoſe weight is 12 <abbr>lb</abbr>; and his Diameter is divided into 300 equal part; which done, work as followeth.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51545:60"/>
                  <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>By which I find 131 parts of the Ball given to be the juſt Diameter of a Ball of one pound weight, of that Country-Weight. As you may ſee by the Diameters herewith annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Line AB the Diameter of the Ball given, and the Line CD the Ball found for one pound.</p>
               <p>After you have found the true Diameter of one pound Ball, you muſt divide the ſame into 1000 equal parts; or make a Diagonal Scale of the ſame Diameter of the one pound Ball, and ſo reſort to the Table of Cubical Numbers; and having a Scale of Paper or Wood ready, you may ſet the Diameter of the Ball on it, from one pound as far as the Table doth run.</p>
               <p>
                  <note rend="inter">The Demonſtration and Diameter of a Ball of 12 pound being given, the Diameter of one pound Ball is alſo given, as in pag. <hi>92.</hi>
                  </note>And that I may make it the more plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Diameter of a Ball of 12 pound; and from that, by working as is before taught, you may have the Diameter of one pound Ball, which is here found, and true in every Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus having the Table of Cubical Numbers, wherein you find the firſt pound is 1000 in its Root, and the ſecond 1259 of the parts of one pound Ball, which is 259 parts more than the Ball of one
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51545:61"/>
pound; which added to the Diameter of one pound, gives the Diameter of a Ball of 2 pound; which place on your Ruler, then the Table gives 1442, for the Diameter of a Ball of 3 pound; and if you take 442, and add to the Diameter of one pound Ball, you have the Diameter of a Ball of 3 pound: And thus you may encreaſe and go upward till you have a compleat Height-Rule of what height you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>So making it, as you are taught, you may anſwer any Queſtion demanded of the Weight of Ball, of the Metal and Weights of the place it is made for. For all places have not one Weight, as you ſee by the Table following.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The Proof of the Height-Rule.</label>
Now every Height-Rule for Ball, of what Metal ſoever it be made for, is proved in manner following: That when you extend your Compaſſes to the height of one pound, and with the ſame extention turn your Compaſſes, you ſhall reach 8 pound; and if you take the Diameter of a 2 pound Ball, and turn the Compaſſes about, muſt fall in 16 pound Ball; and of 3 pound to 24 pound: So that all Ball being twice the Diameter of the other, muſt carry 8 times the weight of the other.</p>
               <p>Further-more, By the Cubical Table, with the Diagonal Scale of the height of one pound Ball, you may give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to make Height-Rules, ſhewing the Weight of Iron Ball in any Place or Country, knowing the proportion it beareth with our own Scots or Engliſh Weight: So that here it will be very requiſite, in regard ordinarily every Countrey have their own dinſtinct Weights and Meaſures, to give a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of ſome ſeveral Places and their Weights compared with ours as you ſee, and as ſhall be further demonſtrated for the Gunner's more eaſe.</p>

                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:51545:67"/>Thus having both Arithmetically, and by Tables, given Inſtructions how to make an Height or Diameter-Rule for Ball; and likewiſe having ſhown both Arithmetically, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically, and by Tables, how to deduct the Wind from the Bore of a Peece, thereby to know her true Diameter of Ball; and having given Tables of the Weight of Ball by their Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters: Therefore it follows, by the Weight of the Ball and Fortification of the Peece, that all Ordnance have their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der either for Proof or Action.</p>
               <p>And, as I have ſhown by the Tables, all Braſs or Iron Ordnance ought to have their Powder to their Proof; for True-Bored Ordnance, and True-Fortified, the Weight of their Ball from 1 <abbr>lb</abbr> to 8 <abbr>lb</abbr>, and from 8 to 18 three quarters of their Balls Weight; and from 18 to 48, two third parts of the Weight of the Ball, and ſo infinitely.</p>
               <p>For their Ordinary, follow the Tables where you may ſerve ſufficiently, and ſave Powder.</p>
               <p>For Powder in Service or Action, it is to be referred to the Gunners diſcretion; and here I will give you Tables, whereby the Gunner may give Powder to Taper-Bored Ordnance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Proof or Action, or any hot Service, from 1 <abbr>lb</abbr> Ball to 36 <abbr>lb</abbr> Ball.</p>

               <p>AS formerly I have ſhown, all Ordnance are not true-bored; therefore I ſuppoſe it will be neceſſary for the Young Gunner to know how to give Taper-Bored Guns their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and though they are not ordinarily in theſe Countries, yet it may happen ſometime the Gunner may be ordered to make uſe of ſuch. In my Judgment there are no Guns more fit to go in the Head of Regiments in an Army than Taper-Bored Guns are: I mean not Leather Guns, by which the King and Country hath been cheated, but ſuch as they make in <hi>Holland</hi> of Braſs, Caſt Ordnance. Neither do I mean thoſe Taper'd Guns, with which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> cheat the World, being Plates of Braſs within and without, betwixt the Skins there are Bars and Hoops of Iron.</p>

               <p>As I am here to ſpeak of Chamber-Bored Ordnance, ſo I do remember that in <hi>Holland</hi> they uſe to bore their Guns of 6 <abbr>lb</abbr> Ball to 8 <abbr>lb</abbr>, and that there may come of theſe Guns to be made uſe of.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Three ſorts of Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note>Now know that of Chamber-Bored Guns, there are three ſorts; to wit, firſt, Thoſe that ſhoot Iron Ball; Secondly, Thoſe that ſhoot Stone Ball; and thirdly, Thoſe that ſhoot Granadoes and Fire-Works.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Know that it is a Chamber-Bored Peece which hath two right and true Bores; the one is the vacant Cylinder, all from the Muſle till you come to the Charged Cylinder; the Charged Cylinder is from the Touch-hole to the great Bore, called the Chamber, becauſe it is not ſo great a Bore as the other.</p>
               <p>But if this Chamber be too long and narrow, or ſmall to continue Powder for this ſort of Peeces, then the Ball may be delivered before all the Powder be fired, and do little Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For it is without controverſie, that the vehemency of any Ball ſtruck from a Peece, is by vertue of the Powder fired in the Peece before it come out, and is rather hindred than fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by any Powder that is fired after it is out. Likewiſe there be Chambers ſhort and wide, which may be harmful; for the Powder all firing ſuddenly, before it looſe the Ball, the ſtrength thereof many times doth burſt the Peece; Therefore it is beſt in this, as in all other caſes, a true Proportion be kept.<note place="margin">Things incident ought to be with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for fear of danger.</note>

               <p>The true Proportion of a Chamber in a Chamber-Bored Peece that ſhooteth Stone, is once and a half the Diameter of the Ball long, and the Diameter of the Chamber is two third parts of the Diameter of the Ball; having this Proportion, one pound of Powder will ſerve to prove a Peece that ſhooteth 4 pound of Ball, and three quarters of a Pound for Action, the Ball being Stone.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXV. Therefore I will here give ſome needful Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations for Gunners of Ships.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe firſt is, That the careful Gunner coming into a new Ship, diligently and carefully meaſure his Guns, to know whether they, or any of them, be full Fortified, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced, or leſſened in Metal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then he ſhall with a Ladle and Sponge draw and make clean all his Guns within, that there remain not any old Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Stones, Iron, or any other thing that may do harm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he ſhall ſearch all his Guns within, to know if they be Taper'd, Chamberd, or true-Bored, or whether they be crackt, flawed, or Hony-comb'd within: And finding what Ball ſhe ſhoots, to make the Weight of the Ball above the Port; that thereby he may ſet the ſame Mark or Number upon the Cartrage and Caſe, that in time of Service, thoſe who bring the Powder may not go wrong.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Guns being dimenſioned and clean as aforeſaid, the Gunner ſhall take half a Ladle of Powder for every Gun, and blow them off, Sponge them well; and finding them clean, Load then the Peece or Guns with their reſpective Cartrages and Powder; which being rammed home, with a ſtrait Wad after it, then let the Ball roll home to the Wad, and ſet a Wad cloſe home to the Ball, that the Ball roll not out with the tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the Ship; then muſt he Tamken that Peece at the Muſle or Bore, with a Wooden Tampken, which he muſt Tallow with hard Tallow round about for preſerving the Powder from Water; Likewiſe make a little Tapon of Ockam for the Touch hole, which muſt be tallowed alſo for Water, before the Leaden Apron be put over; then make your Peece faſt as occaſion beſt preſents.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Peece loaded and faſt, then the Gunner is to have to every Peece 24 Cartrages at leaſt ready made; to wit, 12 filled, and 12 empty in ſort: Likewiſe he muſt be careful, ſo
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51545:71"/>
long as the Gunner's Crew are buſie with the Powder, that there be no burning Match or other fire in the Ship; alſo to lay his Cartrages in Barrels or Cheſts in ſort, that when there is occaſion to be brought, it be without abuſe.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <note place="margin">Moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for great hurt may come by a Ball too high.</note>6. The Gunner muſt ſee that he ſort his Ball very well, and lay every ſort by themſelves in ſeveral Caſes, and upon every Caſe ſet the weight of one of the Shot which is in them. Alſo he ought to make the Bags for H<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>il, for the Guns above, ready betime, and fill them with Stones, Small Shot, or pieces of old Iron, which may do great dammage to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Men.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If it fall out that any new Ports muſt be cut out in the Ship, the Gunner muſt be careful that they be above a Beam, or cloſe by if poſſible; alſo that they be not higher or lower than the Ports before; Likewiſe that there be room for the Guns to play, becauſe if one Gun ſhould be diſmounted, there might be another brought to her place: And obſerve, that the Carriage ſtanding on her Truckes, the uppermoſt part of the Carriage muſt come to ſtand in the middle of the Port up and down, that a Man may lay his Piece as he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Gunner muſt be careful that the Powder in the Room be well covered with Hides; alſo that the Axtrees of the Truckes be well ſmear'd with Sope; <note place="margin">Theſe not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</note>alſo that his Ropes, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and Sponges be ready at hand; and he muſt not let the Powder lie unturned above one month, otherwiſe the Salt-Peter will deſcend to the lower part of the Barrel, which is to be feared if Men ſhould make uſe of that Powder: And he muſt every Month draw the Ordnance, if he fear they have got any Wet or Moiſt to the Powder, alſo for fear of the Salt-Peter diſſolving, which may prejudice the Peece. And he muſt be careful of the Candle and Fire about the Gun-Room and Powder-Room, that there come no diſaſter. Likewiſe he muſt keep a good Account of all Materials that belong to the Guns, as Ball, Match, and Powder, what part thereof he ſpends, and alſo what now remains, that he may give a good account what is become of them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A Gunner muſt uſe all diligence before he Rencounter with his Enemy, to ſet a Balley of Water betwixt every two Guns, that when they ſee conveniency, they may dip the Sponges for cooling of the Peeces, and fear of Fire remaining,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51545:71"/>
which may do hurt: And that he be careful not to ſhoot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he hit, for it is ſure, when the Enemy ſees that he is not hurt, it gives him more courage: But to encourage Young Gunners, I will counſel them at Sea, not to uſe a Lont-Staff in Service, but firſt obſerving the way of both Ships, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one heave and the other ſet, or both heave and ſet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and alſo the ſailing of the Ships, if both one way, or on ſeveral Tacks, whereby he ſhoot not in vain: Now if the Gunner have a ſmall piece of light Match, he ſtanding at the left ſide of the Peece, ſhall ſet his right foot in the Carriage, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Peece, and according as he ſees occaſion give fire, and at the fire giving, retire his right foot, and before the Peece be recoiling the Gunner is free; and by trying his Dexterity, will make a good Experiment, and that he will do good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: But if the Ball have not done to your expectation, you may help the next; for when you ſee from the Breech of your Peece to the Muſle, and ſo to the Mark, you have a ſight of three things; ſo <hi>Euclide</hi> avers, that ſeeing over any three things, you have a right Line from the firſt to the third, through the ſecond; for there is no Man dare promiſe to make a good Shot at Sea, if he have no experience of the Peece, and obſervation of the Ships motion.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Alſo the Gunner muſt be ſure that there be no melted Stuff for Fire-Works done in the Ship but on Shore, for it is dangerous for a Gunner, and great hazard for Ship and Goods, yea and Mens lives: Likewiſe there may no Fire-Work be brought above in the Round-houſe or Cabin to ſtand, for fear of ſhot, but muſt be kept below till time of need, either in the Powder-Room, or Steward-Room: By the hazard of ſuch things there hath been many and cruel Examples.</p>

                  <label>Of Neceſſaries that a Sea-Gunner ought to have for his Ordnance.</label>
Neceſſaries that a Gunner ought to have for his Ordnance are many, and the quantity is according to the quantity and quality of his Guns; and alſo if he be in a Man of War, or a Merchant-Man, then there is difference of Proviſions, only I will here name them, let every Gunner take what he thinks

will fit, and at the Voyage end give an account what is ſpent, and what he hath, and how he ſpent that which is gone.</p>

Firſt, Take the Diameter of the Peece upon the thickeſt part at the Breech with a pair of Callabaſſer Compaſſes, and likewiſe at the Muſle at the thickeſt part thereof; then draw upon a Paper or Board both Diameters: So laying a Ruler through
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51545:73"/>
the Centre, draw the Diameter, and then you may the eaſier take the Difference betwixt them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. <hi>How to level a Peece of Ordnance to ſhoot at Blank.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What Point-Blank Diſtance is.</note>SHooting Point-Blank is a term very much miſconſtrued amongſt our Gunners, for I have heard ſome ſay, they have ſhot a mile and more Point-Blank; the which is contrary to the nature of Great Ordnance, for it is obſerved, that it is much to ſhoot 350 Paces Blank, accounting 5 foot to a Pace, which is little over the ⅓ part of a mile.</p>
               <p>But to ſhoot Point-Blank, is to be underſtood, that then the hollow Cylinder of the Peece lieth upon a level Line, ſo that the Ruler of the Quadrant being put into the Mouth of the Peece, the Plumb-Line hangeth perpendicular, then that Peece lieth to ſhoot Point-Blank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To know how to make a good Shot at a Mark, within Point-Blank-reach of the Peece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Peece lying as is before ſhown, ſet the Diſpart of the Peece at the place required on the Muſle, then a Ruler from the Diſpart to the Breech of the Peece; ſo turning your Peece to the Mark, you looking from the Breech alongſt the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to the Mark deſired; fire your Peece, and if there be
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51545:73"/>
nothing defective in the Peece, or Carriage, or Platform, you make a good Shot: But if the Peece lie ſo, that the Ruler of the Quadrant being in her Concavity, and the Plumb-Line cut any of the Quadrant, then is that Peece ſaid to be cleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and will ſhoot further than when ſhe lieth level, except there be ſome Object which lieth higher than the Peece to ſtop it. And if that Peece lie ſo, that when the Ruler of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant is in her, the Plumb-Line hang without the Line of Level, then that Peece is ſaid to lie under Metal, and will not ſhoot ſo far as if the Peece were lying level, except there be a very great deſcent under the Peece.</p>
               <p>Moreover it is certain, if Men have time, and the Object lying within Point-Blank-reach of the Peece, that the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gunner obſerving theſe Rules, may do good Service at the firſt or ſecond Shot: for it is certain, that if a Man look along any three things or marks on one Line, then betwixt the firſt and third there is a right Line over the ſecond; ſo that if a Man look from the Breech of a Peece, over the end of his Diſpart on the Muſle of the Peece, and to the Mark he is to ſhoot at, then the Breech of that Peece and that Mark li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on a right Line through the Diſpart: Therefore it is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, the Mark being within Blank-Reach of the Peece, if the Peece be loaded and fired ſhe will make a good ſhoot, all impediments being removed.</p>

               <p>IF the Ball err, contrary to your expectation, either above the Mark or below, or on either ſide, follow the Rules follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to help the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule <hi>1.</hi> If the Shot err too high or too low, help it thus,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you have done as is deſcribed, and that the Shot hath carried too high as in D, or too low as in E, the Mark you ſhoot at being in C; having loaded your Peece, you are to find
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51545:74"/>
the middle of the Bore of the Peece, and the places on the Baſe-Ring and Muſle-Ring correſponding, then you are to ſet the Diſpart, ſo you cauſe traverſe your Peece till you bring the Breech of the Peece A to the top of the Diſpart at the Muſle B, and the Mark C in a Line; after Fire given, you hold this for a Rule.</p>
               <p>But the Gunner may lay his Peece very artificially, and yet the Shot may carry contrary to expectation ſeveral ways; if it be too high as in D, help it thus; having laid your Peece as at firſt, in the Line ABC, and found the Ball in D; then lengthen your Diſpart on the Muſle-Ring, till looking over the Peece you find ABD; this done, you are to cauſe lift the Breech of your Peece, till over your Peece and Diſpart you find the appointed Mark C; then fire, and you will hit your deſired Mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerve the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Peece, Numb. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note>Likewiſe if your Shot at firſt had been below the Mark, as in E; you are to Load her and bring her to her firſt ſtation, and then you are to take from your Diſpart ſo much, till you have the Line ABE; this done, you are to lower the Metal of your Peece, till you find your deſired Mark ABC; fire your Peece and you do good ſervice.</p>
               <p>Now if the Ball ſhould come to light on either ſide of the Mark, as (in the ſecond Figure of the Copper Peece) in E to the right hand; to help the next, lay your Peece in all points as before, with her Diſpart; then you are to go to the Breech of your Peece, and find at your conveniency a place on the Baſe-Ring, looking over the Diſpart, you ſee the mark of the ſhot at E; mark narrowly that place of the Baſe-Ring, (with Chalk or what you pleaſe) keeping that mark to look over your Peece, then you cauſe traverſe your Peece till look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over your mark on the Breech, your Diſpart, and behold C your deſired Mark in a Line; fire that Peece and you have your deſire. And if to the left hand, you may help in the ſame manner.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Obſerve the figure in the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Peece, Numb. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note>But if you were to ſhoot at any known diſtance, without the Blank-reach of the Peece, upon any degree of Random, firſt meaſure the diſtance to the Object, and as you find it in proportion to the Blank-reach of the Peece, the ſame quantity you may take from the Diſpart. For if your diſtance be ¼ farther than the Blank-reach of the Peece, then take from the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51545:74"/>
Diſpart ¼ part of its length; by holding this proportion, if the Object be on a right Line from you, you will do good ſervice. Many times it falls out, that when a Gunner enters a Battery, Caſtle, or other Fortification; before he can have time to obſerve Rules, orders are given to fire ſome Ordnance; it may be in all his Life he hath not ſeen the like before that time, therefore he muſt lay his Peece by the diſcretion of his Eye and former experience; if then his Ball ſtrike the Mark, his experience and diſcretion is a good Rule; but if the Ball go beſides expectation, you may help as is before taught. For if the Gunner obſerve theſe Rules cautiouſly, he ſhall find both pleaſure and profit, and have praiſe of the Spectators.</p>

Likewiſe one <hi>William Claes,</hi> in his Book called the <hi>Practick Busketrie, pag</hi> 94. affirmeth the ſame by many Inſtances, That a Ball ſhot from a Height will over-ſhoot the Mark, though there be no impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment. But I cannot blame the <hi>Hollander,</hi> in regard his Country is very plain, and no remarkable Height, whereby he might have confirmed what he ſaith by practice. But I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adhere to <hi>Luigui Callado</hi>; for in his <hi>Practick manual de Arteyleria,</hi> Chap. 8. he informs, That a Ball being ſhot from a Height, will ſtrike below the Mark; as I my ſelf by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice have found divers times.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">By Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</note>For in the year 1650, I was in the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> when that Army of Rebels to our King did beleaguer that Caſtle, ſo that many times I had occaſion to ſhoot ſo far under Metal, or below the Level-Range, that I have been forced to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51545:75"/>
cut the Breſt-band of the Carriage quite out, and ſo to elevate the Breech of the Peece, that it hath been ſuppoſed ſhe would fall over the Wall; and though in this caſe I durſt not coin my Peece with faſt Bed and Coin, yet always I found the Ball to hit below the Mark till I helped it.</p>

Now at this time I was by the Governor commanded, that there ſhould not a Gun be ſhot in the Caſtle; which I took as an ill Omen of what followed; I demanded a reaſon for it: he told me I had too much Blood on my Head already: I being ſomewhat troubled, leſt his Majeſty, and thoſe that loved him, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and in the Caſtle, ſhould ſuppoſe me a helper to the Treachery, deſired the Governor to give me Orders in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the Souldiers, otherwiſe I would not deſiſt. <note place="margin">When a Sheep is General of an Army of Lions they may be beat.</note>So he ſent for me, and on the Head of the Parado, commanded me that no Ordnance ſhould be ſhot in the Caſtle; for if any Gunner ſhould do it, I ſhould ſuffer a Counſel of War. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, being curious to have down the Head, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Honour above what I can write, I laid a Peece of 24 <abbr>lb</abbr> Ball; and becauſe I durſt not be acceſſary to any Acting, far leſs to that, I deſired <hi>Thomas Kniblo,</hi> who was Keeper of the Magazine, that he ſhould fire that Peece, after he ſaw the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and I gone to walk; which he did. The Governor hearing a Shot, and I in his company, inquired who had ſhot that Gun: I anſwered, I knew not; ſo that one returned to the Wall to know who it was, and whereat he ſhot; the young Man anſwered, Sir, I thought that it was ſin in you and the Maſter Gunner to ſuffer theſe Men to fortifie themſelves, and raiſe Batteries before your Noſe, and you not ſtop them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhot at this, meaning the Battery.</p>
               <p>But that Providence had ordered that Head to be taken down with more Honour, I admired of its abiding, for the Ball took the Stone joining to the Stone whereon it ſtood; which Stone fell down, and killed a Drummer, and a Souldier or two, on their march betwixt the Lucken-Booths and the Church, and the Head remained, till by his Majeſty it was

               <p>
                  <label>Example.</label>
Suppoſe the Thread to fall on 25 parts of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbra Recta,</hi> and the diſtance betwixt your Foot and the Wall be 30 foot: Then ſay, as 25 parts of Right Shadow is to 100; ſo is

30 foot the diſtance given, to 120 foot the Height required: to which you muſt add the length betwixt the Obſervers Eye and the Ground.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if the Gunner cannot Cipher, then do this; go ſo far back or fore, till you ſee the Mark deſired, and that the Plummet-Line of your Quadrant (being ſtill obſerving) fall on the parts of Right Shadow: And know that if the Line fall on 100, the Diſtance is equal to the Height: If the Line fall on 75 parts, then the Diſtance is three-quarters of the Height; if it fall on 66 ¾ parts, then is the Diſtance ⅔ parts of the Height; if on 50 parts, the half of the Height: if on 33 ⅓ parts, one third part of the Height; and if on 25 parts, one, quarter of the Height; by which you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Height of what you obſerve.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But in obſerving, if the Thread fall in parts of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbra Verſa,</hi> or Contrary Shadow, then know that the Diſtance of the Ground to the Place obſerved, is more than the Height of the ſame: And the Proportion is, as 100 parts is more than the parts cut off the Contrary Shadow; ſo is the Diſtance from the Mark, unto the Height of the thing obſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Example.</label>
Suppoſe the Thread to fall on 25 parts of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbra Verſa,</hi> and the Diſtance betwixt your Foot and the Wall be 300 foot: Then ſay, As 100 parts is to 25 parts of Contrary ſhadow; ſo is 300 foot the Diſtance given, to 75 foot the Height re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. To which if you add the Diſtance betwixt the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers Eye and the Ground, you ſhall have the true Height.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And if you cannot Cipher, then go ſo far backward or forward, always ſeeing the Mark deſired, till the Thread fall on what parts of Contrary Shadow you would have it; and if it be 100, then is the Diſtance and Height equal; if it fall on 75 parts, then is the Diſtance one quarter more than the Height; if it fall on 66 ⅔ parts, then is the Diſtance one third part more than the Height; if the Thread fall on 50, then is the Diſtance one half more than the Height; if it fall on 33 ⅓, then is the Diſtance ⅔ more than the Height; if on 25, then is the Diſtance three quarters more than the Height:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51545:81"/>
Ever adding the length from your eye to your foot, then you ſhall certainly have the true Height.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This manner is uſed to meaſure the Height of any thing, whereto you may have acceſs: If it were that you muſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Height of a Wall, or any other thing ſtanding on the ſide of a River, then you muſt have two Obſervations; in manner following: Firſt, Meaſure the diſtance from your ſtation to the ſide of the River; being come to the brim of the Water, ſtand perpendicularly upright, draw down the brim of your Hat before your face, till you looking by the brim of your Hat, ſee the Foot or Root of the place you would mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; then turn your ſelf about, obſerving in all things your geſture, till you ſee on that ſide of the River where you ſtand, ſome Hill, Down, Houſe, or any other Mark; thus you ſhall meaſure with your foot the diſtance to it, and then Work as is before ſhown.</p>
               <p>Secondly; <hi>To meaſure the Height of any thing ſtanding on a Plane from you, when you can have no acceſs to it, or were hindred by the Enemy to come near it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To this Work you muſt have two ſeveral Obſervations, as followeth: Put the Ruler of the Quadrant to your eye, in ſuch manner, that through the Sights you ſee the Mark deſired;<note rend="inter">To know how far, or what Diſtance you are from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Forts, or Strengths, is moſt neceſſary for a Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> take notice then what parts of Contrary, or Right Shadow is cut by the Thread or Plummer-Line, and then where you ſtand ſet up a Staff; then you are to go a remarkable diſtance backward or forward, and take there your ſecond ſtation; and obſerve your Mark as before, then note well what parts of Contrary or Right Shadow your Line cutteth; note that alſo down: Now if it be ſo, that in both your ſtations the Plummet-Line hath fallen on parts of Right Shadow, then deduce the leſſer from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and keep the Difference: Then ſay by the Rule of Three, As the Difference in the parts of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbra Recta,</hi> is to 100 parts in the Quadrant; So is the Diſtance between the two Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the deſired Height of that Body: But it is to be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51545:82"/>
underſtood, that you muſt not forget to add the Height of your Eye from the Ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Example.</label>
In the firſt place, when you find the Thread fall in 25 parts of the Right Shadow, and in the ſecond on 50; then let the diſtance betwixt the ſtations be 30 foot.</p>
               <p>Say then by the Rule of Three; As 25, the difference of the parts of Obſervation, is to 100 parts in the Quadrant; So is 30 foot the diſtance of the Stations, to 120 foot the Height required; to which add the Height of your Eye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if at one Station (or poſſibly at both Stations) the Thread falls on parts of Contrary Shadow, then the parts muſt be converted to parts of Right Shadow, as ſhall be ſhown in the following Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Example.</label>
                  <note place="margin">Experience is the beſt School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter.</note>Suppoſe there were placed ſome Guns on the top of a Hill, as in the Figure by A; by which the Gunners in the Valley B have a great deal of loſs and trouble; wherefore order is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to one of them, to do his endeavour to diſmount theſe Peeces at A: Now to do this with underſtanding, and what haſt convenient; Firſt, He muſt know the height of the Hill AD, with the diſtance BD: Then he may by Prop. 47. of the firſt Book of <hi>Euclide,</hi> find the length of the Hypothenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Line AB; to be aſſured how many degrees of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant his Peece muſt be elevated to the Mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Take for Example.</label>
We ſay that the firſt Station obſerved, the Thread fell on 25 parts of Contrary Shadow, and at the ſecond on 90 parts of Right Shadow; then you cannot take 90 parts from 25 parts; therefore you muſt alter the 25 parts of Contrary Shadow to parts of Right Shadow, in manner following: Multiply 100, the one ſide of the Quadrat by it ſelf, and you have 10000; this you divide by 25 the parts of Contrary Shadow, and you have in the Quotient 400 parts of Right Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51545:82"/>
which is equal to 25 parts of Contrary Shadow; then take 90 parts from 400 parts, there remain 310 for the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: Alſo let the Diſtance betwixt the two Stations, from B to C, be 200 foot: Then ſay by the Rule of Three; As 310 is to 100 parts in the Quadrant; So is 200 foot the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Stations, to 64 16/31, which is very near 64 ½ foot, the Height of the Hill AD: We ſhould now ſhew the way to find the Diſtance AB and BD; that thoſe who cannot Cipher, may underſtand this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; <hi>Therefore we will give one Example or two, that they may do ſuch without Arithmetick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe muſt ſearch out their Stations, in which the Thread may fall on all ſuch parts of the Right and Contrary Shadow as they deſire, which is eaſie to be done, if they go diſcretly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or backward, and meaſure the Diſtance betwixt the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till the Thread fall where they deſire.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the Thread fall at the firſt Station upon 100, and at the ſecond on 50 parts of Right Shadow, then is the Diſtance half the Height.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or if the Thread fall at the firſt Station upon 100, and at the ſecond on 66 ⅔ of Right Shadow, then is the Diſtance betwixt your Stations one third part of the deſired Height.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And if the Thread fall at the firſt Station on 100, and at the ſecond on 75 of Right Shadow, then is your Diſtance juſt one quarter of the deſired Height.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Likewiſe if at the firſt Station the Thread fall on 100, and at the ſecond on 66 ⅔ parts of Contrary Shadow, then is the Diſtance half the Height.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Or if the Thread fall at the firſt Station on 100, and at the ſecond on 50 parts of Contrary Shadow, then is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance equal to the Height deſired.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſame it ſhall be, if at the firſt Station the Thread fall on 50 parts of Right Shadow, and the ſecond on 66 ⅔ of Contrary Shadow: But ſtill remember to add the Height of your Eye above the Ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:51545:83"/>
Fourthly; <hi>To meaſure the Diſtance to any place, or the Breadth and Length of any Plane or Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid before, it appears plainly that in the meaſuring the Height of any thing, there muſt be once a known Diſtance, to wit, ſome length of the Plane whereon the Height is erected: Likewiſe in meaſuring any Diſtances, as the length of a Field, it is very neceſſary to know the Height of ſomething thereby; which may be eaſily done: for if you were to meaſure the Diſtance to a Fort, Battery, Trinal, or Bulwark, which you deſire to know; if the Diſtance be not great, in that caſe you need know no Height but your Eye from the Ground where you ſtand; But if the Diſtance you would meaſure be great, then it is needful to have a known Height to ſtand upon, which Height you muſt add to the Height of your Eye, which may be done with a Plumb-Line, whoſe Marks you know: Then Work as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Example.</label>
Take for Example, that you deſire to meaſure the Diſtance from B to D; then turn the Centre of your Quadrant to your Eye, and obſerve through both your Sights the Point D; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark well what part of Right or Contrary Shadow the Thread cutteth; If it happen to fall on 100 parts, then ought the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to be equal to your Height: But if the Thread fall on parts of Contrary Shadow, which in ſuch Caſes is ordinary, then is your deſired Length more than your known Height, ſo much in proportion as 100 is more than the parts cut of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Shadow, which the Line ſheweth. Therefore ſay by the Rule of Three; As the parts of Contrary Shadow, which the Plumb-Line ſheweth, is to 100; So is the known Height unto the Diſtance required.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:51545:83"/>
                  <label>Example.</label>
The Thread cutteth 1 ⅓ parts of Contrary Shadow, and the Height from the Eye to the Ground is 5 foot: Then work as followeth, and you will find the length BD to be 375 foot.

               </p>
               <p>Now having the Perpendicular AD, and the Baſe BD, you may eaſily find the Hypothenuſal AB, to be near 380 foot: But here you are to extract the Square Root, for <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide</hi> in the 47 Prop. of the firſt Book of his Elements, hath proved by Demonſtration, That in Right-Angled Triangles, the Square which is made of the ſide ſubtending the Right Angle, is equal to the Squares which are made of the ſides containing the Right Angle. Where if two ſides be given, we may find the third ſide thus; in the Right-Angled Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ADB, you have AD 64 ½ foot, and you have the Baſe BD 375 foot; whoſe Squares being added, and the Square-Root extracted, you ſhall have the Square-Root near to be 380 ½ foot for the Hypothenuſal AB: For Extracting the Square Root, it is deſcribed in Chap. 6, and 7.</p>
               <p>This I have done for the uſe of Young Gunners, that when occaſion may preſent, they may lay their Peeces at a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Degree, thereby to come near the Mark at the firſt Shot; And always may obſerve a greater diſtance from a Height to a Valley.</p>

There is a Caſtle, as the Figure ſheweth, and in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51545:84"/>
there lies a Peece of Ordnance; If it were deſired of the Gunner to know if this Peece might be of ſervice to diſmount the Peece in the Battery C: Now the Gunner muſt deſire time to meaſure the Diſtance from him to the Battery C; whereby he may the more aſſuredly Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall he take a Line and meaſure the Height AB; then ſtanding at A, ſhall take the Quadrant with the Centre to his Eye, and beholding through the Sights the Mark C, Remark narrowly the parts cut by the Plumb-Line, which is without fail parts of the Contrary Shadow: Then ſay, As the parts of Contrary Shadow are to 100; So is my Height from the low Battery to the Diſtance required. Let the Height AB be 95 foot, and the parts of Contrary Shadow 5 ¼ and you will find the <hi>Facit</hi> to be 1809 ½ foot, or 362 Geometrical Paces very near.</p>

               <p>But if you pleaſe to reduce the Diſtance to Paces, divide the Quotient by 5, for 5 foot make a Pace, and you have as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>This is ſo clear, that I think any Gunner may perceive, that if he in the Battery C, elevate his Peece two Degrees above the Level, that then he might do good Service, and by once firing, if the Ball go beyond expectation, you may help the ſecond.</p>

WHen a General with his Army hath beſieged a ſtrong Fort, Caſtle, or Town, and hath ſecured his Army by Intrenchments, and hath taken notice of the moſt fitting places for Approaches: Now the Queſtion is to the Gunner, How near they may approach the place with Batteries, and at what Diſtance the Cannon will do beſt ſervice, that there they may be planted and made.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer.</label>
If I were to anſwer, I would deſire to approach as near as it were poſſible to come, and to plant the Batteries about 100, and ſome 50 foot from one another; and if it were poſſible, even to the Counterſcarp; not only thereby to give the place moſt dammage by the Guns, but alſo to fruſtrate the Enemy from ſallying out, as likewiſe to do them moſt prejudice at their Caſements, to Guns and Gunners, by which they might be forced not to dare to ſhew a Head above the Wall.</p>

This Reſolution is good, but very dangerous to perform; for as the Proverb is, It is dangerous to chaſe a Dog out of his Neſt; for if there be a brave Enemy within, how could you approach ſo near, but it ſhould coſt many a brave Souldier his life?</p>

As it is without controverſie, where Carpenters work there muſt fall Chips; but that will never cool the courage of a brave generous Spirit, ever conſidering, where-ever we are, we are in the Hand of God; yea, the danger is not in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alike, for if you be where there is Earth enough to work, there you begin to caſt up Trenches and Mounts againſt the Town to ſave your ſelves from harm; for the higher the Earth

                  <label>Anſwer.</label>
That muſt be according to the greatneſs of the place; if the Bulworks be of great diſtance one from another, in that caſe I would rather chuſe a Bulwork than a Curtain, there to make my Breach, thinking that I ſhould come ſooner to my advancement there, becauſe the Bulwork is better fortified than the Curtain, and is a principal Strength: And if you make your Breach for Men to enter, you find them ſometimes cut off, ſo that you may begin to fortifie there anew, where you are as it were in the Enemies Boſom; this occaſion you have not in a Curtain.

If you did ſtorm this Bulwork, and found there ſome Guns that before you had not ſeen the like, and that you muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently uſe them againſt the Enemy, and know not what Ball they ſhoot; What is the quickeſt way to find their true Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Ball?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer.</label>
If the Peece be left loaded, ſhe muſt be drawn; for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in policy might ſo leave a Peece, on purpoſe to ſplit about their ears that take her: When drawn, a piece of bowed Wire being put in at the Touch-hole down to the bottom of the Concave, upon the Metal mark that Wire with a Knife; hale the Wire up till it hack on the upper part of the Metal in the Chamber, and mark as before your Wire; take the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt the two marks, and that is the Diameter of the Bore: And ſee if it be the Diameter of the Bore at the Muſle: if you find her a true-bored Peece, then take your Compaſſes, and extend them to the length betwixt the lower mark and the hack of the Wire; this Extention being taken on the Scale of Powder gives you her Powder; and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Compaſſes betwixt the marks, lay that to the Height-Rule, and you will have the Height of the Ball: Otherwiſe finding the Weight of the Ball, reſort to the Table of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51545:87"/>
for that Fortification, and where you find her Weight of Ball, you will find the Weight of Powder for that Peece, for having the Diameter of the Bore and one ſide Metal, double the one ſide Metal, and add the Bore to it, you have the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the whole Peece: Then ſay, As 7 is to 22; So is the Diameter of the Peece to her Circumference: And having one ſide Metal at the Breech and Muſle, you have a Diſpart: So preſently you may do good Service.</p>

When you have the Diameter of the Bore of a Peece, How do you know what Ball will ſerve that Peece to ſhoot, and neither be too high, thereby to hurt the Peece; neither too low, to miſcarry by reaſon of the too much Wind?</p>

                  <label>Anſwer.</label>
As it is convenient the Ball be ſomething lower than the Bore of the Gun that it ſerves for; and ſome have thought fit to declare one quarter of an Inch to be a ſufficient Wind to all Balls; and others have declared, that a twentieth part of the Diameter of the Ball, is a ſufficient Wind for all Guns: I hold that quarter of an Inch to be altogether abſurd; becauſe except a Man can give the true Demonſtration, as you are taught, and is ſet forth in <hi>pag.</hi> 42, to 52. he ſhall never know how to extract the Wind betwixt the Bore of a Peece and her Ball.

                  <hi>Averdupoiſe</hi> Weight, as you may ſee by Dr. <hi>Weybard</hi>'s <hi>Tactimetria</hi>; wherefore I ſay that is the moſt certain Rule. Now if 4 Inches Diameter weighs 9 <abbr>lb</abbr>; What ſhall two Inches weigh? you will find the work ſtand thus.

               <p>And it is a general Rule; behold you ſee a Ball of 2 Inches Diameter weigheth 1 <abbr>lb</abbr> 2 ounces: If you hold this for a Rule, you may Work and Correct all Tables of this kind that are made in <hi>England:</hi> Likewiſe, I ſay, you may find the Weight of any Iron Ball thus; Say,

               <p>Now here a Ball of 4 Inches Diameter by his Tables, weighs but 7 <abbr>lb</abbr> 6 ounces: But I praiſe Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> who ſays, We muſt not expect truth from his Tables.

               <p>Now you may perceive, that they err only by neglecting to Calculate their Tables; But as the Blind lead the Blind, ſo they both fall in the Ditch; for he gives 8 ½ <abbr>lb</abbr>, or 8 <abbr>lb</abbr> 8 oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

And by the Tables of Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> though he hath placed 71 <abbr>lb</abbr>, I can find by his working but 68 <abbr>lb</abbr> for the weight of a Ball of 8 Inches Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.</p>
               <p>So this will be proved by the Line of Numbers, for if you ſay 4 Inches gives 9 <abbr>lb</abbr>, what ſhall 2 Inches give; place one foot of your Compaſſes in four Inches, and the other in 2 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, keeping the Compaſſes at the ſame extent, ſet one foot in 9, and meaſure downwards 3 of theſe Extents, which will reach to 1 <abbr>lb</abbr> 2 ounces; likewiſe ſay, if 2 Inches give 1 <abbr>lb</abbr> 2 ounces, what ſhall 8 Inches weigh; extend your Compaſſes from 2 to 8 Inches; the Compaſſes at the ſame extent, place one foot in 1 ⅛ part, and three of theſe Extents will ſtrike at 72 <abbr>lb</abbr>: But if the Weight of a Ball ſhould be demanded in <hi>Scotland,</hi> you ſhall find a Ball of 1 <abbr>lb</abbr> is 2 Inches; and one of 4 Inches 8 <abbr>lb</abbr>; and 8 Inches Diameter (if you obſerve the

It is true, that if you elevate a Reinforc'd-Gun to 45 Degrees, and the True-Fortified to the ſame, ſhooting both one Ball, that then the Reinforc'd Peece will drive his Ball more violently, and ſhall fly farther than the Ball of the True-For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Peece: And great reaſon for it, the Reinforc'd is long and well Fortified; they of Braſs are 10 Diameters of the Bore about the Breech, and his Proof of Powder is ⅚ parts of his Balls weight, and ſome the whole Balls weight; and the True-Fortified but 9 Diameters of the Bore, which gives a great difference in Powder, for ſhe is proved with ⅔ parts of her Balls weight of Powder; beſides the one is longer by half as long again as is the other; for the one being 18, and ſome 20 foot long, the other is but 10 or 12 foot long: by theſe Reaſons, being better Fortified, hath more Powder, more length, and but equal Ball; ſhe muſt burn more of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

This is ſo to appearance; for as we ſay any thing conveyed through a Pipe or Bore, hath his Courſe more violent accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Bore is long, and hath been found ſo to do by ſome: But I ſay experience teacheth otherwiſe now, for I have ſeen a Demi-Cannon tryed, being of a reaſonable length, and broke a foot and a half at the Muſle; yet when the Peece was tryed again and again, did carry her Ball as far as ſhe did before.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer.</label>
I hold that which Reaſon and Experience both ſheweth: Namely, that the ſtrength of any Peece is ſo much more as the Peece is longer; but being fortified accordingly, and with this reſtriction, that it is done with an indifferent length; for from 8 to 12 foot long, being of the ſame Bore and Fortification, the Peece ſhall add to the flight of her Ball: But from 12 to 20 foot long, you ſhall ſee them abate of the Balls flight; the reaſon is, in all thoſe too long Guns, the Powder is burned before ſhe deliver her Ball, whereby the flame and ſtrength of the Balls flight is abated. This is ſtrange, and oppoſeth the thoughts of many Gunners; but by my Experience here in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Saltwich.</hi> I found it ſo, and therefore not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted.</p>

But if you load a long Peece with ſo much more Powder, and being thereto Fortified, ſhould not that give ſtrength to the fire, that thereby the Ball ſhould more vehemently be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther driven?</p>

                  <label>Anſwer.</label>
It is without all queſtion, that a Peece doth moſt harm ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its greateſt Loading; yet it is found ordinarily, that in

all Guns having Powder above half the Balls weight, all taketh not fire; yea, I my ſelf at <hi>Saltaſh</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> gave a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Cannon, ſhooting 12 <abbr>lb</abbr> Ball, more than her ordinary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, and laying 6 pair of Sheets on the Ground, on the deſcent of the Ground; and after fire given, I found two ounces of the Powder whole, by which you may gueſs what more was burnt after it came out of the Peece by the flame; and ſo I ſuppoſe the Balls flight is not increaſed but diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Whereby you may underſtand that too much Powder is diſadvantageous for Ordnance, and that there ought inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be had to their Loading: And for theſe reaſons I have Calculated theſe Tables, which I am ſure is the neareſt Truth to give Ordnance their Powder, of any yet given out by any other.

If it were a calm day, and the Skie clear, and the diſtance betwixt both about 300 or 400 Paces, then I would hold little or no difference which of the two to chuſe; but if it were a little Wind, the Skie thick, and the Air damp and moiſt, I would rather chuſe a Demi-Cannon than a Sling, or rather a Whole-Cannon than a Demi-Cannon. My Reaſon is this, That the Wind, and Miſt, or Rain, hath not ſo much ſtrength to divert a great Ball as a ſmall, which is found Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally: for divers times I have ſhot from the Caſtle of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> to the Links of <hi>Leith,</hi> when the Enemy was exerciſing; but when there was a gale of Wind on either ſide, or againſt, I found the ſmall Ball to err; but the Demi-Cannon came much nearer my expectation.</p>

There are divers Opinions about ſhooting of this nature, for moſt do ſay, that ſhooting againſt the Hill from a Valley, the Ball will be below the Mark; and likewiſe ſhooting from the Hill to the Valley, that the Ball will ſtrike below the Mark; but as I have ſhewn by my own Experience, theſe Authors are not to be owned: for I doubt it is with divers that have writ of Gunnery, as that the Proverb will hold good, <hi>viz.</hi> Many Men ſpeak of <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> that never ſhot in his Bow.

               <p>BEfore the Train doth march, there goeth out Pioneers, each of which is furniſhed with either a Shovel, Scoop, Pickax, Crow or Handſpike; having for their Commanders, a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Lievtenant, and two Corporals, with a Drum to every Company; who are to make plain the way for the Cannon.</p>
               <p>After them firſt follow the 6 Sackers or Demiculverings, drawn with their reſpective Horſes, with their Proviſion of Ball in Wagons, and their Powder in Wagons, beſides there muſt be at the Rear of the Cannon, if any whelm, help ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to mount them again.</p>

               <p>Now when the Cannons are on their March, every Gunner to his reſpective place, muſt march at the right ſide of his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51545:92"/>
Peece, and by them their Harbingers, who take notice of all the Ropes, and other Proviſions for Draught, and help them if defective: and alſo to ſee that the Axtrees be well ſoped or tallow'd, that thereby the Train may march without ſtop: The Wagon-Maſter muſt have ſpare Horſes by his Draught, if any fail either in Wagons, or in Draughts of the Ordnance. Several have given Rules for ſo many Horſes to a Peece of ſuch a Weight; as thus, every 500 <abbr>lb</abbr> of Metal for a Horſe-Draught; where the Guns alone, beſides the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, muſt have 120 Horſes: So I reckon for Guns, Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and ſpare Horſes, there will be 180 Horſes: Now for Powder, Ball, and other Proviſions, 100 Horſes more with Wagons, beſides Wagons for the Officers.</p>
               <p>This is ſuppoſed to be for ſo many Cannon in fine plain Way; but the Horſes in every Country are not all alike, for I have been drawing Cannon, and allowed but to every Horſe 350 <abbr>lb</abbr>, and hardly able to perform; but ſure it is, where Horſes are to be preſt, there need no halt to be made for Draught, if the Conductors be provident. But if there ſhould fortune Cannon to be drawn in places where Horſes or Oxen (for if you order a Yoke of Oxen for a Horſe-Draught it will be equal) are not to be found; Therefore I will ſet down a general Rule, how theſe Guns may be drawn by the ſtrength of Men. And the Calculation ſhall be made for the forenamed 14 Guns; by which may be reckoned any other Draught having the Weight.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is conceived an indifferent Man will draw 100 <abbr>lb</abbr> for his part, (but on a plain way); therefore for ordinary, I do allow a Man to draw 80 <abbr>lb</abbr> weight: And you will find, counting the weight of theſe 14 Peeces thus; The Cannon 7000 <abbr>lb</abbr>, a peece, is 14000 <abbr>lb</abbr> for them two; then the Demi-Cannon 4500 <abbr>lb</abbr>, and theſe 6 are 27000 <abbr>lb</abbr>; for the 6 Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culverings 3200 <abbr>lb</abbr> a peece, and theſe will weigh 19200 <abbr>lb</abbr>; which in all is 60200 <abbr>lb</abbr>: which ſum being divided by 80, (the pounds of draught for one Man) will make 752 Men to draw the 14 Peeces of Cannon. Now theſe 752 Men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy with diſcretion and good order, that every Man may do his endeavour, you are to make faſt your Ropes in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, on either ſide of the Carriage; before on the Hackes one Rope, and on the middle of the Bolt or Breſtband one; And
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51545:92"/>
upon every Rope, ſhall be ſo many Ropes ſo made faſt, as every Man may have 2 ½ foot diſtance one from another; ſo that the Draught-Ropes for a Demiculvering muſt be 17 fathom long: Now for the Demi-Cannon and Cannon, they may be reckoned by their proportion; ſo the Men are ſet to Work, as the Figure hereby doth ſhew.</p>
               <p>This will be thought a new Invention, but I uſed the ſame in my Lord <hi>Middleton</hi> his Service from <hi>Aberdene</hi> to <hi>Fyvie,</hi> where I cauſed them to make theſe Sled-feet, as you ſee faſt to the Carriage, in this manner; near to the Breech of the Peece there is a Bolt, whereon the end of the Sled-foot is; and under it, at the foot-end of the Carriage, a Square-hack to lay over the Sled-foot, and then a Rope through the Sled-foot: And a Man or two thereby ſhall ſteer a Gun by a Height or Hole, in the way where ſhe is to be drawn, ſo that many times it ſaves the Guns from falling over.</p>
               <p>And when you are to meet your Enemy, or make uſe of your Guns, you may lift up your Sled-feet, and lay them all along the ſide of the Carriage in manner as you ſee, on a Hack where they do not trouble, and unhacking the Ropes from the Hacks before, you may uſe your Gun at your pleaſure.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVII. <hi>Of Powder and its Ingredients.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is a Paradox to many, to think that Salt-peter, Brimſtone, and Coal, being incorporated, ſhould be the only Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions for Powder: But know this, That whoſoever deſires to learn to ſhoot in great Ordnance, or to make Fire-Balls, or any kind of Fire-Works, ſhould learn to know the nature and ſympathy of theſe three.</p>
               <p>Salt-peter that is pure and of a Chriſtal Colour is beſt; the refining whereof is ſet down by divers Authors, as Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> and others; yet the nature of it is to burn downward, but if pure and well refined, will burn upward, with a great deal leſs noiſe.</p>
               <p>Brimſtone is hot and loves the fire, and the fire loves it; it is of a ſharp nature; when you kindle it, it fireth upward; its colour is of a bright Yellow if it be good.</p>
               <p>The Coal neither augmenteth nor diminiſheth any ſtrength or force of it ſelf, only it ſoon taketh fire, by which the Salt-peter and Brimſtone receiveth the fire, and perfecteth their Work: The beſt Coal is made of the lighteſt Wood, and the lighter the Wood is, the Coal ſhall be the better. And it is obvious to all, that when theſe two oppoſites, <hi>viz.</hi> Salt-peter and Brimſtone are incorporate, and fired together, the Coal nouriſhing the fire, there is nothing can reſiſt the force there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, until the fire diſſolve the whole in the Air.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Example.</label>
If you load a Gun with Powder, (which is nothing but theſe Ingredients incorporate) or any other narrow Pipe, ſo ſoon as the fire comes to the Body, and the Compoſition is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate by the fire; then doth it force it ſelf out to the Air ſo vehemently that nothing can withſtand it.</p>
               <p>Powder is made of divers ſorts, as Cannon-Powder, Piſtol-Powder,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51545:96"/>
Muſquet-Powder, and Powder for Fire-Works.</p>
               <p>Powder may be tryed three manner of ways; Firſt, Put your hand in a quantity of Powder, and gripe it hard, if it crack and make a noiſe in your hand, you may judg it is good; but if it crack not in your hand, it is either not well wrought, or it is ſpoiled.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way, is by taking a little Powder, and put it on a ſmooth plain Board, or a piece of flat Stone; put fire to it, if it go up quickly to ſmoak, and leave no marks behind it, you may judg it good; but if it burn ſlowly, and leave white Corns behind it, then you may ſuppoſe it is not well incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and hath too much Salt-peter in it, or that there is too much Duſt and Coal therein.</p>
               <p>The third is by the Taſte; if it be too ſharp in the taſte, it is like to come moiſt; but if it taſte a little Niteriſh and ſweet, and hard-corned, it is good: There are ſeveral other ways to try the goodneſs of Powder, that for brevity I here omit.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Of Fire Works.</label>
There are ſeveral Sorts of Fire-Works, ſome for Offenſive Service, ſome for Defenſive Service, and ſome for Recreations and Sport: I intend only to ſpeak of thoſe which are to be uſed in earneſt, not minding to meddle with thoſe for Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this time, in regard they are ſo learnedly treated by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Of Fire-Works, and thoſe Ingredients uſed for Compoſitions.</label>
As there are ſundry and numerous Ingredients that may be uſed in Fire-Works; ſo Fire-Works are ſo to be mixed as they may work ſeveral effects, according to the ſeveral occaſions may be produced in War; therefore it is impoſſible for any Man to lay down Rules, which only muſt be obſerved; but that the Gunner may have a taſte of every Diſh, that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be uſed in bringing Enemies to Ruine, and Rebels to the Obedience of their Lawful Princes, obſerve theſe following.</p>

               <p>The Mortar-Peece may be elevated to any degree of the Quadrant; but the contrary you may obſerve in great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, for they cannot be elevated above 45 degrees; and the nearer you approach to any place to ſhoot at it, you muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball your Peece under 45 degrees; ſo that if Tables were to be made for Great Ordnance, they may not exceed 45; and Tables for Mortar-Peeces may be made from 1 to 45 degrees, and from 45 to 90 degrees.</p>
               <p>Now he that would Load a Mortar-Peece, may elevate her Muſſe to what degree he will for his own conveniency, the Peece made clean, you put the Powder in the Chamber, and upon the Powder a Wad of Rope-yarn, Hay, or what you can provide; then you put a Turf of Earth cut on purpoſe, that is large wider than the vacant Cylinder upon the Wad, which fills the Chamber, and then you put the Granade or other Fire-Work above that Turf, and putting Graſs or Hay about your Granade, that it may lie as you would in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and alſo to keep the Powder in the Mortar from the fire of the Feuſey.</p>
               <p>The Mortar Peece being thus Loaded, you cannot give fire, with any hope of ſucceſs, before you obſerve and know, how far the Diſtance is betwixt you and the place where you would have your Ball to light, and alſo know, how far that Mortar-Peece can caſt her Ball from Degree to Degree; likewiſe you muſt obſerve the Weather, whether it be calm, or blows hard, or if the Wind be with or againſt you, or if it be to the right or left of you: Having duly conſidered theſe things, the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may do well the firſt ſhot; but if he erre, he muſt amend the next.</p>
               <p>So that it ſtands to reaſon, that when you have found the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51545:97"/>
Diſtance to the place you would lay your Ball at, that you may know by this Table near what Degree of the Quadrant the Peece muſt be laid to reach thither.</p>

               <p>Now if you were with a Mortar-Peece at the back of a Wall near a beleaguered place, and there were a remarkable place, as Magazine, or Store-Houſe, or Corn-Barn, and it is deſired to lay the Granade or Fire-Ball in that place, the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and this place being found to be 243 paces, as in the Figure from A to M; Then look in the Table, and ſee what Degree is oppoſite to 243, and you will find 83 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and ſo the Mortar-Peece A muſt be elevated to 83 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to caſt her Ball or Granade into the Houſe M. Do ſo with all other.</p>
               <p>When you would diſcharge a Mortar-Peece, firſt you muſt ſet fire to the Feuſie of the Granade or Fire-Work, and you muſt ſee it burn well before you give fire at the Touch-hole, and mark narrowly where the fall is, thereby to help the next if need require, in form as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The Feuſies for Granades or Fire-Balls, may be filled with this Receipt; 1 part Powder, ½ part Salt-peter, ¼ Brimſtone, and ¼ part Roſin, being all well beat to Meal, and moiſtned with Linſeed-Oil.</p>
               <p>

                  <label>Now follows the Proportion of the Pattard, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe thereof with all things belonging thereto.</label>
The beſt Pattards are made of Copper, to wit, 1/10 part of Braſs: they are made of Iron alſo, ſome more ſome leſs, as the Figures ſheweth: The Pattard A is 12 Inches long, the Diameter at the Breech is 7 ½ Inches, and the Diameter of the Concave is 5 Inches; then the one ſide Metal muſt be 1 ¼ In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thick; ſhe is at the Muſle ½ inch thick, and the Diameter of the Bore at the Mouth is 10 inches, and weigheth 76 ½ <abbr>lb</abbr>.</p>
               <p>There is another Pattard as B, which is 9 inches long; the Metal at the Muſle is ½ inch thick, and by the Touch-hole 1 inch thick; the Diameter of the Bore at the Mouth is 7 inches, and the Bore at the Breech 4 inches.</p>
               <p>To fix your Pattard to do good Service at a Gate, or Caſtle, or other Fort, or Gariſon; you muſt have before the Mouth of the Pattard a good Oaken Plank of about 2 foot in ſquare; this Plank may be banded with Iron, both on the one ſide and on the other, as the 2 Planks D D, both being but one Plank, but the Bands of Iron are on the one ſide croſs the other; the Plank may be 3 or 4 inches thick; the Powder to the Pattard B may be 4 <abbr>lb</abbr>, and the Powder to the Pattard A about 6 ½ <abbr>lb</abbr>; when you have loaded the Pattards, and rammed the Powder home, you ſhall put in the Muſle of the Pattard a Wooden Tamken, which you ſhall beat home with a Wooden Mallet, till it be faſt enough; then you may fill the Chinks with hard Tallow, and melt Pitch or Wax and run round about the Tamken, that the Powder in the Pattard may be preſerved from Water. When you are to apply the Pattard, and make it faſt to a Gate, you muſt firſt bore the Touch-hole thereof, and fill the ſame with ſome Powder mixed with Linſeed-Oil; but a Feuſie may be better, filled with the Compoſition for Granade Feuſies, that it may take time to burn before the Pattard fire, that the Man may remove that made it faſt. To make it faſt, you muſt have two Hack-Bolts, as E, with Scrues at the ends, which are to ſcrue into the Gate, where you have the Plank D, to which the Pattard G is faſt with a Chain by the Ears in the middle, or by a Staple drove in the Gate, to which the Chain is faſt, as you ſee by the Figure G and D, to the Gate F: To

carry this Pattard, you muſt have a Wagon with Wheels, as the Figure H: This Wagon muſt be as broad as the Plank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pattard, having in the fore-part three ſharp-pointed Iron Pikes, that when it is run at the Gate it may hold faſt, that the Man or Men may ſtand thereon, and fix their Scrues, to which they muſt make faſt the Plank with the Pattard: Then giving fire to the Feuſie, and removing back the Pattard, having done Execution to expectation, the Parties may enter according to the Commands given.</p>
               <p>While this Work was intended for the Young Gunners In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, I hold it my duty to ſhew you that there is no Fire-Work that can be invented or made for Offenſive Service, but the ſame will and may be made uſe of for Defenſive Service; but ſome may be made for Defenſive Service, which can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be uſeful in Offenſive Service, as Barrels for ſmoaking out of a Mine, or Balls, or Bags to burn the Wood, or Rubbiſh caſt in to fill up a Ditch, Powder-pots, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Granades to ſhoot out of a Mortar-Peece.</label>
The Mortar-Peece ſhoots all ſorts of Fire-Works; Firſt, Granades, the Shells made of Iron; Secondly, Balls or Bags made of Canvas, in form of Granades; Thirdly, A Mortar-Peece may ſhoot Stones coated with Fire-Works, or Stones in the Night to fall among the Enemy, as if it rained Stones.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the firſt the Iron Shell of a Granade muſt be filled with good Powder, and ſome well-powdered Brimſtone mixt with it, that thereby the Powder may throughly fire the more ſuddenly. In your Granade you may put ſome little Balls of unquenchable Compoſition, that when the Shell breaks and brings down the Rubbiſh of a Houſe, thoſe little Balls may raiſe Fire afterward; which is fearful in a Gariſon, and is one of the greateſt terrors can come among them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <label>Canvas-Balls for Granades.</label>
2. Theſe Balls muſt be made of ſtrong Canvas; when you have made your Canvas-Ball, you may fill it with Sand, and then take two Iron Rings, and mould your Ball ſtrongly in form as you ſee the Ball in the Copper Plate N° 3. But if your
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51545:99"/>
Ball be of great weight, ſingle Line will not ſerve to mould your Ball, and therefore you muſt make it a great deal leſs than the Bore of your Mortar-Peece, both in regard of the moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and coating of your Ball.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The Ingredients or Compoſition to fill this Ball.</label>
Take Powder, Salt-peter, and Brimſtone, of each a like quantity, theſe you ſhall beat ſmall, and incorporate them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; moiſten them with Linſeed-Oil, and work them with your hands till you make a Paſte, that it may ſtick together in ſmall Balls if need be; This is a Slow Compoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Another for the ſame.</label>
To this Compoſition you muſt take 4 parts of Powder, 3 of Salt-peter, and 3 of Brimſtone; theſe being ſeverally beat to Meal, moiſtned with Linſeed-Oil, and wrought as aforeſaid; This is a good Compoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Another for the ſame.</label>
Take 12 parts of Salt-peter, bray it not very ſmall, and 12 parts of Brimſtone not ſmall beat, work them well together, and moiſten them with 2 parts of Linſeed-Oil; then take 6 parts of good Salt-peter, bray it as ſmall as Currants; incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate theſe Ingredients, and make a Ball thereof as big as a Walnut; and if it burn as long as you may tell 30 ſoberly, then is the Compoſition both good and ſtrong.</p>
               <p>When you have found your Compoſition good, you may fill your Bag at diſcretion.</p>
               <p>In moulding, you muſt have 2 Iron Rings of the thickneſs of ¼ of an inch each of them; the one 4 inches Diameter, and the other 3; and as you mould the Ball, rive the Line through the Rings; to which you muſt have a Splice-Iron, or Marlin-Spike of Horn; a tack of Harts-Horn is good to do it with: In the largeſt of your Rings you may ſet your Feuſie; the Feuſie may be made of Wood, the Pipe bored; you may bore 3 or 4 ſmall holes near the lower end; it is the cuſtom of Feuſies to reach the middle of the Granade or Ball; you may
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51545:100"/>
pierce this Ball when filled with Fire-Work, and put therein Iron Pipes, loaded with Powder and Shot; but be ſure the Touch-hole be wide enough, that Ruſt doth not ſtop them from firing; theſe Pipes muſt be beat in, till their Muſles be equal to the Line.</p>
               <p>Then you muſt coat this Bag with theſe Ingredients follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Take Pitch, melt it, and put therein Oil till it be tough and pliable; then put ſome Powder in it; and if you take Hurds or Tow, and ſpread on a Table, run this Stuff upon it; then wrap your Ball therein, and open your great Ring for your Feuſie-Hole, and ſtop it with a Plug.</p>
               <p>When you are to uſe this Ball, take out the Plug, and put therein your Feuſie filled; then Load your Mortar-Peece, and ſet your Ball in the Mortar in the ſame manner you do your Granade; having laid your Peece as ſhe ought to be, then fire the Feuſie, and ſo your Peece: If this Ball fall near any thing that will take fire, it will burn, and do the Enemy great harm.</p>
               <p>For thoſe Stones, that may be ſhot from a Mortar-Peece, if you dip them in Compoſition made for Water-Balls, with Pitch, Roſin, and Wax, When they are coming down (as it were from Heaven) into a Gariſon, it puts them in great fear, and makes them gather about the fire.</p>
               <p>Then you may have a Mortar-Peece loaded, and put therein ſtones as big as a Mans head; and laying her as the other, theſe ſtones falling amongſt the people, put them quite out of heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Another Granade for a Mortar-Peece.</label>
If you make a Ball of Canvas, as is before ſhown, well moulded and filled with Sand, then melt Pitch and Roſin, and dip the Canvas Bag in it; but you may have Muſquet-Shot cut in two, and clap them on this Coat as full as the Bag can ſtand, as you ſee in the Copper-Peece N° 2; then Coat it again, put in the Feuſie; and if you fire it among Men, it will do great harm, the Sand being put out, and the Bag fill'd with Powder.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Another for the ſame.</label>

Take 2 parts of Salt-peter, 2 of Powder, 1 of Roſin, 1 of Brimſtone; pound theſe Ingredients very ſmall, and mix them together; then moiſten them with Brandy-Wine and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed-Oil, or <hi>Oleum Benedictum</hi>; then fill your Bag of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas made for the purpoſe, very hard and full, then ſtick an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-head through the Bag, and make it faſt with Twine, Rope-Yarn, or ſuch like; and put a Plug for the Feuſie-Hole, where you mind to fire it; then coat it over with Pitch, rub Powder in the Touch-hole, give fire to it, and ſhoot it where you will, and it will burn very well.</p>
               <p>But if you would not have it burn, till it light at the place appointed, in regard you would not have it ſeen, you ſhall take a little good Tinder of a Fingers length, and put it in at the part you mind it ſhall take fire; put that Tinder in fire, and ſhoot it where you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>There are Gunners, that when they have moiſtned their Compoſition, clap it about the Arrow, and then lay Canvas about it, and few it faſt, bore holes, prime it, fire it, and ſhoot it, where they have a mind; but it muſt be coated firſt: The form of an Arrow you have in the Copper plate N 5.

If you take very good Powder, beat it very ſmall, ſearce it through a Sieve, and moiſten it with Linſeed-Oil, work it to a Dow or Paſte; it is good if you make uſe of it preſently; for this Compoſition is too ſtrong to be kept, and therefore you may add to it half ſo much Salt-peter, and a little Brimſtone, then it may be kept.</item>
                  <item>4. If you take of the beſt Piſtol-Powder you can get, beat it very ſmall, ſearce it through a narrow Sieve, moiſten it with Linſeed-Oil, work it well as is before taught, and you have the beſt and ſtrongeſt Compoſition without doubt amongſt all the others; but it is likewiſe too ſtrong to be kept long, and fearful, if dry, to be fired.</item>

               <p>All theſe may be made in Cloth-Balls, coated as aforeſaid, and made uſe of as the Gunner pleaſeth, for offending of an Enemy.</p>
               <p>As there is nothing now unlawful, (though never ſo baſe) that can be acted againſt an Enemy; ſo it is very common for Perſons to take upon them to be Spies and Intelligencers, who void of fear will enter with the Enemy in their Army, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer or Gariſon, on purpoſe to betray them. Thoſe Men who will give themſelves to be Spies, they muſt certainly be of an idle and baſe diſpoſition, void of the fear of God or Man, and ſubtil, ſecret, and Maſters of all Villany; yet there are many ſimple Men, that for love of Mony do put themſelves out for this uſe; theſe Men, although they be inſtructed in what they are to go about, and how they may carry themſelves in the ſame; nevertheleſs, either before or after they have done their Buſineſs, by ſome inſtinct of fear, otherwiſe by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Heaven, they are caſt down, and by their own ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city divulge ſomething, which brings them to be apprehended, and through torture confeſs the Matter, and according to the Law of Arms receive Juſtice beyond other Malefactors, in regard the Offence of Treachery, under the colour of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is a Treaſon, and Treaſon is as the ſin of Witchcraft, which will certainly be puniſhed both by God and Man.</p>
               <p>But if the Gunner ſhould have occaſion to uſe one of theſe for his ſecret Buſineſs, he ſhould chuſe one of thoſe, who had been employed in ſuch buſineſs before, and of ſuch a nature, that though he be threatned, and asked queſtions ſeeming as though he might have been betrayed; nevertheleſs he muſt ſtand unalterably to his own innocency, without fear to change his colour, or coldneſs of heart to tremble; but with a merry countenance, dexterity in ſpeech, knowing ſubtilty to anſwer what is demanded.</p>
               <p>I do remember, at the Line at <hi>Leith,</hi> when his Majeſties Army lay there; one day there came a pretty ſubtil young Man from <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Army, making his pretence that he had

left his Service of purpoſe to ſerve the King; he was brought before General <hi>Alexander Leſlie,</hi> who put the Matter ſleightly by, and gave the young Man leave and freedom to take Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice where he pleaſed; whereupon he took occaſion to go down the Line, ſee all our Army, and continued two dayes: I ſent for the young Man, and in company I did alledg he was a Spie; he put it off with the fineſt jokes that could be; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me, There was not a faithfuller Subject than he in the Army, ſwearing effectually to the point; but that afternoon he went to the Enemy to receive his Reward; he was a ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly young Man, but of a ſolid and diſcreet behaviour, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I did admire his audacity and impudency; this Fellow was fit for a Spie.</p>
               <p>Another; when I was in the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier came running right up from the Enemies Works, that if he had been a Runaway, they might have killed him; but this fellow came running into our Moat, and when he was there, feigned himſelf mad, and would be up; the Governor <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſs</hi> deſired to have him up; ſo I cauſed hale him up by a Rope about his middle, (I am ſure the Wall rubbed the Skin off his hand); yet when he came in, he was ſlabbering, as it is ſaid <hi>David</hi> did before the King of <hi>Gath,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. but hear what he would, and ſee what he would, he anſwered nothing to that purpoſe; but after he had been that day and night in the Houſe with the Governor, he found the way back to the Enemy without help: Such as theſe are worthy to be Spies.</p>

one part of Salt-peter, theſe three pounded very ſmall and mixed together; put to them ſo much Linſeed-Oil as will make the Compoſition like a Conſerve; then make Balls of the ſame, and if you will, you may make it for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows to ſhoot out of a Bow, or Cros-bow, or by obſerving what is ſaid of Fire-Trunks, they may be uſed in the ſame manner, or they may be heaved by a Mans hand.</p>

Take fine Powder, mixt with ſome Brimſtone ſmall beat; put therein ſome <hi>Aſſa Foetida,</hi> ſome pieces of Verdigreeſe, and ſome Camphire: This heaved in a Ships Round-Houſe, Fore-Caſtle, or betwixt Decks, will make a fearful ſtink and ſmoak.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>To make Match that ſhall not Smoak.</label>
Take a glazed Earthen Pot, and put therein clean red Sand till it be ⅔ full; coil therein Match, ſo that no part thereof touch other; then cover it well with the foreſaid Sand, and coil Match thereon as before, and then put Sand above it till the Pot be full; which done, you are to put the Cover on the Pot, and lute it cloſe, that no Smoak come forth of it; put this Pot into a Sinder or Charcoal-Fire, and cover it all over; let the Pot ſtand there till the Fire extinguiſh of it ſelf; then take it out, ſhake the Sand off, and your Match is ready.</p>
