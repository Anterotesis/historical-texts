            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it is that in the general, there is a great deal of hardſhip and difficulty at ſuch a time and in ſuch Circumſtances as theſe, from thoſe pains and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows which do naturally attend that condition, for in looſing that knot, in diſſolving the cloſe Conjunction of Soul and Body, there muſt be, and we have reaſon to ſay there is, a great deal of unconceivable Anguiſh and Affliction, 'tis an extream violence to Nature, and the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to it. And therefore muſt mightily fret and moleſt us, for whence (but from the moſt horrid pain and uneaſineſs) can proceed ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant convulſions, cold ſweats, deadly faintings, ſhort breathing, diſtraction of the Eyes, and other dreadful Agonies that attend it? For if theſe and the like, which we obſerve in daily Spectacles of Mortality are dreadful to behold; What muſt they be to thoſe poor Creatures that do, and to us that ſhall ſuffer under them? And therefore a good man, that is not afraid of death, can't but ſhrink and tremble to think of the way to it, that is beſet with ſuch horror and diſtraction in every particular; O my God may be the language of the moſt pious Soul, I am willing to die and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thee, being <hi>deſirous to depart and to be with Chriſt,</hi> which is better than a continuance here, but my greateſt concern is, how to come to thee on the other Shore, there is a great Gulf

And doubtleſs the holy Spirit of God doth in ſome meaſure intimate to us the ſadneſs of them, when it mentions it as a great bleſſing to men that it is <hi>appointed</hi> to them, but <hi>once to die,</hi>

One undoubted priviledge whereof, is, that there ſhall be no more of thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful forerunners or concomitants of it, where are ſorrows ſo ſevere and terrible as endanger the ſafety of our Souls as well as Bodies, by ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging us to impatience, diſtruſt, and the like; thence ſays our Church, <hi>ſuffer us not at our laſt hour through any pains of death to fall from thee.</hi> Our greateſt troubles and moſt dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict in this World is uſually our departure out of it, ſo that to this caſe alſo we may apply <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 14, 15.</note>that of the Prophet, <hi>The great day of the Lord is near, it is near and haſteth greatly, even the voice</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:44766:6"/>
               <hi>of the day of the Lord, the mighty Men ſhall cry therein bitterly. That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and diſtreſs, a day of waſteneſs and deſolation, a day of darkneſs and gloomineſs, a day of clouds and thick darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Pains and Agonies of a dying State render it moſt terrible and dreadful.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will appear again to be ſo, <hi>FROM MENS MISGIVING THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHTS OF THEIR AFTER STATE.</hi> I do not mean their doubtfulneſs of it, for I am apt to think, that the greateſt pretenders that way are ſufficiently convinc'd when they come to die, and the ſence oft hat their languiſhing Condition will ſoon rub up their belief of another Life; but now moſt or all Men are under no ſmall diſtreſs and perplexity from the conviction and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that future Life, for which none is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently fitted and prepared, but hath reaſon, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from himſelf, to have ſome diffidence, ſome diſtruſt or ſuſpicion of his condition in it, and it is what becometh a prudent and a good Man; for an over-weening opinion of our ſelves, and a confident preſumption of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for Heaven may be ill grounded and miſtaken, and ſeems to be inconſiſtent with a truly devout and penitent Soul, <hi>Be not high minded but fear</hi> is the Rule that ſuch go by even in theſe circumſtances. We muſt be ſenſible,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44766:6"/>
and ought to be eſpecially ſo, when we come to die, That we have had a great work to do in a little time, and being that God now calls us <hi>to give up an account of our Stewardſhip,</hi> it muſt put us into very great fear and conſternation to think with our ſelves what we have done, and whither we are going, and how can we but ſuſpect our condition, when we conſider that we are not able to <hi>anſwer God one word in a thouſand;</hi> muſt it not then moſt deeply concern, and mightily affect our Souls, to conſider that near approach to their endleſs and unalterable State, and the beſt of Men may have ſome fear or ſuſpicion at leaſt of their Condition in it. This now is their grand Affair, and if they fail and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry here they are irrevocably gone and loſt for ever: Who then can avoid being concern'd at this great and weighty change, when he thinks with himſelf, that he is now haſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another world, and at the gate of Eternity, tho he fears not death, yet the apprehenſions of another State muſt ſtrike a damp into his Soul, and make him hugely ferious and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed in his thoughts; <hi>Mens hearts failing them for fear</hi> of what may become of them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther State. Nor is it blamable or unchriſtian to be ſo, for beſides what Reaſon the beſt of Men may have to ſuſpect themſelves, ſuch a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44766:7"/>
temper as this, will diſpoſe us for all due care and circumſpection in that moſt ſolemn time and ſeaſon, and ſuch an humble diſtruſt of our ſelves may and will have better effects, than a very daring confidence and preſumption: For the comfort of good Men, at the moſt depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon hope, doth ſhew that at the beſt they lie under ſome donbtfulneſs and inſecurity: And therefore as you ſee Mens miſgiving thoughts, as to a future State, is no ſmall trouble and perplexity to them in their dying circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Their trouble herein doth further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, <hi>FROM THE THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHTS OF PARTING WITH ALL THE PLEAS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RES AND ENJOY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS HERE BELOW.</hi> Men that have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World muſt needs have ſome intereſt and affections fix'd in it, and there is ſcarce any that do or can ſit ſo looſe to theſe ſecular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as to bear the removal from <hi>them</hi> with an even and undiſturbed Spirit; nay ſo far is it from this, that theſe frequently prove the moſt pungent conſiderations or reflexions in that diſmal ſtate: <hi>Have I,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>laboured all my life time for nothing but</hi> vanity <hi>and</hi> vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit, <hi>for I find it to be ſo now; I am to be removed, and to be taken from it: For this have I beat my brains, wearied and moleſted my</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44766:7"/>
               <hi>ſelf, for this have I cheated and purloin'd, for this have I overreach'd or ſupplanted my Brother, wrong'd or oppreſs'd my Neighbour, and muſt I be depriv'd of all in a moment? What ſorrow like to my ſorrow</hi> will the Worldling ſay? And thoſe pleaſures that others have too much in dulged, will but the more perplex their thoughts when they are thus forc'd from them; nay even the moderate and lawful enjoyment of theſe things, will occaſion in us no ſmall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vexation of mind, at this final par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with them: Tho it behoves us to do it with Chriſtian courrage, and Reſignation, yet we cannot without extream ſorrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment ſay at that time, <hi>Farewel Wife, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel Children, farewel Friends, farewel the World finally farwel whatever was here dear and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And give me leave to add, the more have been Mens comforts, and thoſe of good Men have been the moſt and trueſt, the more and greater muſt be the grief and concernment, for that utter removal, and diſmal ſeparation from them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The troubles of a dying State muſt be again very great, <hi>FROM THE SENCE OF SIN OR G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ILT THAT WILL THEN CROWD IN <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PON <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> However we may forget God and our ſelves in a time of Health and Proſperity, when theſe decline or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44766:8"/>
for ſake us, we are uſually brought to a ſober ſence, and in ſuch a languiſhing State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition can hardly avoid it; Conſcience, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, will certainly awake when we come to die, and we may have obſerved the greateſt Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Men have then ſuff er'd under, was their not being able to avoid their own thoughts, which are now more bitter and terrible than ever, (and by the way 'tis not only juſtice but withal goodneſs in God to make it ſo.) Now the mind has quick and unbiaſs'd Reflections on its own Actions, and ſets forth its Guilt in true and proper Colours, and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle may well ſay, <hi>The ſting of Death is Sin.</hi> No terror in this State like that which doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to us from our guilty Conſciences which have now got us under hold, and will laſh us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely. We can't now diſguiſe or diſſemble our guilt, there is no ſtifling of it by Riot or Intemperance, lewd and loofe Company can divert us no longer; all the live-long day our ſins will plague and fret us, and in the weariſom nights, when we count every minute, our guilt will ruſh in upon our thoughts, attend us in every <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 20. 21.</note>turn and motion, and render our Souls as reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and uneaſie as our Bodies; if what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith of wicked Men be true at other times, 'tis much more ſo at this, <hi>That they are like the</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:44766:8"/>
               <hi>troubled Sea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt. There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> When we come to die, the greateſt melancholly that ſhall then ſeize our ſpirits, will be from the heavy load and burden of our ſins, that will be ready to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and ſink our Souls. Then we ſhall find that threatning verified in us, <hi>I will reprove</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21.</note>
               <hi>thee, and ſet them in order before thine eyes.</hi> And what grief or anguiſh can be comparable to that, which redounds from this? When we are going hence, and God gives us <hi>Warning</hi> to remove, muſt it not concern and afflict us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all thought or expreſſion, to conſider the danger our Sins have now brought us to? They hide God's face and mercy from us, and in our greateſt Diſtreſs and higheſt need of Comfort, threaten us with utter Ruin and Deſtruction; and nothing now can be ſo cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and intollerable as the thoughts of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed and angry God. And well may that be ſo to us which was the greateſt of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours troubles, for at his dying hour, the guilt of our ſins that lay on him, occaſioned the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt agony of his Soul, and that diſmal excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me.</hi> Moſt certainly the ſence of guilt will be the bittereſt Potion, and the very
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44766:9"/>
dregs of that <hi>Cup of trembling,</hi> Our Hearts will faint, and our Souls will <hi>ſink within us,</hi> and we ſhall ſhake and fear, and <hi>cry mightily,</hi> and have on us ſuch paſſionate concernment as is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible, from the diſmal apprehenſion of the Divine Wrath and Indignation which our ſins have kindled and provok'd againſt us. So that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13.</note>hereupon it may be ſaid with <hi>Cain, My puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is greater than I can bear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, The troubles of a dying ſtate will appear further conſiderable, <hi>FROM THE AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LTS OF O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R SPIRIT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AL ENEMY, WHICH WILL BE THEN MORE AND GREATER THAN EVER.</hi> For to this we may <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12.</note>apply what is ſaid of him, <hi>Woe to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth, for the Devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, becauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he hath but a ſhort time.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we may expect that he will apply his temptations, now more cloſely and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly than ever, for if he diſcharges this laſt part effectually, they are utterly loſt and gone, and he has gain'd them for ever. Wherefore he may be ſuppos'd now to ſet all his Engines on work, and to ply it cloſely. He takes all the advantages that may be of theſe extream and difficult circumſtances; herein he tempts us to fretfulneſs and impatience under God's
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44766:9"/>
hand, to a deſtruſt or diſpair of his goodneſs. <hi>Doſt thou ſtill retain thy Integrity? Curſe God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 2. 9.</note>
               <hi>and die.</hi> If this will not do, he tempts us with too great preſumption on the Divine goodneſs, to a neglect of due Examination and Repentance of our Sins, or diſtracts our thoughts with Secular Affairs. One way or other, he either keeps us from the duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for that State, or endeavours to make us increaſe our ſin in it. Moſt certain it is, that the Devil doth now hope, and induſtriouſly watch, for his Prey; the laſt effect of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Revenge. The caſe here may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what liken'd to that mention'd of him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 4 <hi>The Dragon ſtood before the Woman that was ready to be</hi> delivered, <hi>for to devour the Child as ſoon as it was born.</hi> But may our Souls eſcape like that, and be <hi>caught up unto God and to his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 5.</note>
               <hi>Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, A dying State or Condition, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd very dreadful and terrible <hi>FROM THE THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHTS OR CONVICTION OF AN AF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER-ACCO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NT OR J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DGMENT.</hi> The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner when going to his Tryal, hath all along every ſtep he takes, very ſtrange and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing thoughts, and is beyond expreſſion troubled and uneaſie within himſelf. And what muſt the caſe be with Men, when on the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44766:10"/>
confines of another World, to think of that great and impartial Judgment and Tribunal, before which they are now ſummon'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? And how muſt it affect and cut them, to conſider that they are now haſting to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of that Rightoous and Almighty Judge, who ſhall ſtrictly examine every thought and <hi>idle word, before whom all things are naked and open?</hi> To conſider that after <hi>Death</hi> comes <hi>Judgment,</hi> is that which makes a dying State the moſt ſerious and weighty matter in the whole World. What concernment and anxiety muſt a man truly conſiderative have at ſuch a time? I am dying, I am departing; that is, in other terms, I am called to give up my Accompts, I am going to be Judged before the great God; behold, what matter ſo weighty, what concernment comparable to this? This ſingle conſideration duly weighed, renders ſuch circumſtances very ſtraight and terrible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No other can be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine effect of Mens thorough belief and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction (at that time) of an approaching Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But we have ſufficiently repreſented the black and tragical part, it may be high time now to draw the Curtain, and ſet forth a fairer Seene. Well then, notwithſtanding a dying condition
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44766:10"/>
is thus ſevere and terrible, yet we have particular, extraordinary ſupports and comforts under it. <hi>Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL, FOR THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> ART WITH ME,</hi> to aſſiſt me in theſe ſtraits and neceſſities, and to afford ſuitable helps and advantages under them. And now thoſe great ſupports which God doth give us in theſe moſt difficult circumſtances, may be conſider'd under theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The thoughts of this State; as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That God is therein peculiarly preſent with us, and gives us extraordinary helps and aſſiſtances of his Divine care and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The near approach to Heaven and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The conſideration of Chriſts Death and Sufferings.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The belief and expectation of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The promiſe and aſſurance of pardon and forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The attendance of God's Holy Angels that are ready to receive our Souls.</p>
            <p>Which duly and ſeriouſly conſider'd, will abundantly qualifie and remove all the terrours and difficulties of a dying State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:44766:11"/>
Firſt, <hi>It is a very great ſupport at that time to conſider, That the STATE WE ARE NOW BRO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHT TO, IS ACCORDING TO THE DETERMINATE ORDER AND ALLOTMENT OF GOD,</hi> in whom we live, and move, and have our being. He is the breath of our Noſtrils, he put our Souls into theſe Tabernacles, and we are here only Tenants at Will, liable to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt at Pleaſure. And when we conſider, that <hi>'tis appointed for all men once to die,</hi> and that it is an irrevocable decree of Heaven that we <hi>M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST</hi> all <hi>walk through the Valley of the ſhadow of Death,</hi> why ſhould we <hi>fear any evil?</hi> be diſmay'd or terrified, at that which is the will and pleaſure of the Almighty, as if ſome ſtrange and unexpected accident did befall us? For may we not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 3.</note>ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>That no man ſhould be moved with theſe afflictions, for your ſelves know that we are appointed thereunto.</hi> Is not Gods hand in my ſuffering? Is it not in my death? 'Tis an undoubted mitigation even of this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and affliction to conſider that God hath appointed it as the unavoidable Lot and Portion of all men living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that, on this account, we may ſay, <hi>I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In our dying State or circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>GOD IS PEC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LIARLY PRESENT WITH <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, AND GIVES <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S EXTRAORDINARY</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44766:11"/>
               <hi>HELPS AND ASSISTANCES OF HIS CARE AND GOODNESS. Thou art with me.</hi> That Providence which is always vigilant over us, hath then a more deep and ſpecial regard and concern for us. Are the very <hi>hairs of our head all number'd?</hi> And doth his care extend ſo far, as that one of theſe <hi>ſhall not fall to the ground,</hi> but by the <hi>permiſſion of our Heavenly Father?</hi> May we not hence juſtly conclude, that he is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly careful of us in ſuch danger and extremity as this? <hi>Thou art with me;</hi> it is render'd <hi>Penes me, in loquo quo ſto,</hi> Thou art near at hand, in the very place where I am, not as an indifferent unconcern'd Spectator, but to be <hi>a very preſent help in trouble.</hi> Then this our good God is with us, to comfort our Souls, to ſupport our Spirits, to eaſe our Pain, and give us patience under it, to ſoften our cares, to mitigate the pangs and terrours of Death; then the <hi>Eternal</hi>

word ſignifies <hi>turn, Thou wilt turn all his bed in his ſickneſs,</hi> as it were to make him lie more ſoft and eaſie. And he ſeems to have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted reference hereunto, by what preſently follows in this verſe: <hi>Thou art with me, thy rod and thy ſtaff comfort me.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>At quid adſerunt ſolatis virga &amp; baculus? adferunt &amp; quidem plurimum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ingeniouſly upon it, What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort doth the <hi>rod</hi> and <hi>ſtaff</hi> here import? A great deal; <hi>adverſus latrocinia daemonum hoc Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lientium,</hi> They are thoſe Inſtruments whereby this great Shepherd doth defend his Flock from the rage and malice of the Devils, that wait to devour us.

How dearly doth our Lord Jeſus love us, who, as you ſee, will neglect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may any wiſe conduce to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, our refreſhment, and our comfort?</q> Thus far he, which I have the longer inſiſted on, becauſe it is ſuch a genuine, though unuſual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, and a ſeaſonable repreſentation of Gods ſo great, and peculiar care, and regard for us, in this moſt ſtraight and difficult condition.</p>
            <p>To ſum up this Head; as nothing is ſurer than the day of Death, and our departure out of this earthly Body, which very likely may be attended with blackneſs and terrour, with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pains, and Agonies, too great to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt; yet I may comfortably ſay, that herein <hi>the Lord is my helper;</hi> yea, though <hi>I walk through this Valley of the ſhadow of Death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

Having hitherto run the race that is ſet before us.</hi> We may expect greater ſweets and troubles, and to be more tired, the nearer we come to the end of it. But this is the laſt Stage, if we can bear up under this only remaining difficulty, the day and the prize is ours, we may go on with patience
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44766:13"/>
               <hi>Looking unto Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith.</hi> How muſt it incourage our endeavours, and ſupport our ſpirits, under the ſoreſt preſſure of Death it ſelf, to behold, <hi>with an eye of faith, the glory ready to be revealed,</hi> and to ſee our Lord, with open arms, ready to receive us? Come, bear up under this, and as it is your worſt, it is your very laſt tryal. There are bleſſed <hi>Manſions</hi> prepar'd for you, where <hi>there ſhall</hi> be <hi>no more</hi>

                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4.</note>
               <hi>death, neither ſorrow, nor crying; neither ſhall there be any more pain, for the former things are paſſed away.</hi> Tho it may not ſeem conſiſtent with what I have already deliver'd, to leſſen the ſad and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful circumſtances of our dying hours, yet I may ſay, that if our Souls be duly fix'd on Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Eternity, it muſt in a great meaſure abate, and will, I'm ſure, outweigh the worſt that can be ſaid or conceiv'd of that State. This is able to outballance the utmoſt tyranny of pains and agonies, and to diſpel all clouds and melancholly from our minds. The Night is come, but it brings us to the dawn of Eternity, and <hi>that ſhadow of Death</hi> is the confine of the days of Heaven. <hi>Yet a little while,</hi> and we are gone into <hi>YONDER</hi> World; and muſt it not be a mighty ſatisfaction to us now, to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>We know that if our earthly houſe of this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 5. 1.</note>

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44766:14"/>
               <hi>houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi> To think that the pain will be over in a ſhort time, is ſome eaſe to my mind in the greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; but to add, and conſider withal, that it will be preſently ſucceeded with <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> muſt adminiſter to our Souls the higheſt conſolation. <hi>I will fear no evil, for thou art with me;</hi> to ſay farther, and I ſhall be with thee, be transferred to that bliſsful State, to the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11.</note>preſence of God, <hi>where there is fulneſs of joys and pleaſures for evermore,</hi> is my moſt unſpeakable ſupport, and the very height of comfort and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.</note>
               <hi>The years draw nigh in which thou ſhalt ſay I have no pleaſure in them, while the Sun, or the Light, or the Moon, or the Stars, are darkned. In the day when the Keepers of the Houſe ſhall rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Alſo when they ſhall be afraid of that which is high, and fears ſhall be in the way. The ſilver Cord is looſeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Obſerve, upon that melancholly, and tho elegant deſcription, of our dying condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſubjoyns us a comfort againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal thoughts of thoſe ſad circumſtances, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Death it ſelf; the conſideration of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God in the Immortal State. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt return to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit ſhall return to God who gave it.</hi> In a word, this ſingle conſideration, that <hi>we ſhall ever be with the Lord,</hi> duly weighed and rely'd on, will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44766:14"/>
relieve and ſupport us againſt all the Powers of Death, in its moſt horrid and ghaſtly, appearances, and ſufficiently ſubdue the great difficulties of the dying State.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This is again render'd further eaſie and ſupportable <hi>FROM THE CONSIDERATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON OF CHRISTS DEATH AND S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>FFER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGS;</hi> not only as they do expiate our ſins, and ſo bring comfort to our Souls, as we may have occaſion to ſhew preſently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but withal, upon the account of his great and glorious conqueſt over Death and the Grave, which he vanquiſh'd and ſubdu'd, in the very worſt, and moſt horrid cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that they might have leſs power, and exerciſe leſs tyranny over us. Whereupon the Apoſtle triumphantly ſpeaks, <hi>Death is ſwallowed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 54.</note>
               <hi>up in Victory. O Death, where is thy ſting? O Grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conſider that Chriſt our Lord under went the ſame before us, and in a more diſmal manner than we are able to bear or imagine, is ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation in this moſt ſorrowful condition; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering withal, that in doing ſo, he hath made the way more ſmooth and paſſable for us. Death ſpent his moſt fiery Darts on him, and he hath ſo ſubdu'd his greateſt ſtrength and utmoſt power, that he either cannot, or dare not be over ſevere
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44766:15"/>
and rigorous with us; at leaſt, he can go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he will permit him. <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18.</note>Amen: <hi>And have the keys of Hell and of Death.</hi> Death is now purely under Chriſts command, and can do nothing but by leave from him; and therefore, we may juſtly hope that our gracious Lord will not ſuffer him to exert his utmoſt fury upon us. How ſuitable then is that pious Prayer <note place="margin">Viſitation of the Sick.</note>of our Church at this ſeaſon: <hi>O Saviour of the World, who by thy Croſs and precious Blood haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us, ſave us and help us, we humbly beſeech thee, O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, The troubles and ſorrows of a dying State, are again very much abated and ſubdu'd <hi>FROM THE THOUGHTS OF A FUTURE RESURRECTION,</hi> which will ſatisfie our minds, and make abundant amends for all the doubts or troubles that do now attend us. What though we ſuffer under pains, and may be griev'd to think that part of us ſhall be the prey of Worms and Corruption, yet the belief of this truth will ſoon diſpel the ſorrows that ariſe from thence. The time is coming (and Lord, what joy is it in theſe ſtraights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) when my Soul now returning to God, ſhall meet this body again glorious and refin'd; never more to be vext with, or ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it. <hi>This ſhadow of Death,</hi> and that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44766:15"/>
Night, that is now beſet with clouds and horrour, will conduct us to the morn of our Reſurrection; and how can we be <hi>ſorrowful as Men without hope?</hi> This our Church looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the moſt comfortable ſupport, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our own, or others diſſolution, when in its great Prudence and Piety, it appoints that Leſſon concerning the great Article of the Reſurrection in the Burial Service, a Doctrine if rightly fix'd and believ'd, that will render us <hi>ſtedfaſt and immoveable</hi> in the deepeſt ſorrows. <hi>Thy Brother ſhall riſe again,</hi> was the comfort our <note place="margin">St. <hi>John</hi> 11. 23.</note>Saviour gave to <hi>Mary,</hi> and is ſuch as will be able to bear up our ſpirits, even in the heavieſt tryals of a dying State. For how muſt it ſupport me and others, at that time, to ſpeak after this, or the like manner? <q>You behold me, Brethren, ſeemingly forſaken and diſtreſt; and, indeed, <hi>My complaint is bitter, for my ſoul is exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, even unto death, and my ſtroke is heavier than my groanings.</hi> But yet I would have you believe and think as I do, <hi>that I am only to withdraw for a ſmall ſeaſon; and as the Prophet</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 20.</note>
                  <hi>ſpeaks, to enter into my Chambers, and ſhut my Doors about me, and to hide my ſelf, as it were, for a little moment, for thy dead men ſhall live; together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, obſerve what followeth: <hi>Awake and ſing,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:44766:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>ye that dwell in the duſt.</hi> This long and ſolemn parting may cauſe grief in our hearts, and tears in our eyes; but ſhall we not be comforted, <note place="margin">St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 28.</note>conſidering the time is coming, in which, <hi>All that are in the Graves, ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and ſhall come forth.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Terrours of a dying State are mightily qualified and abated, <hi>FROM GODS MOST COMFORTABLE PROMISE AND AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RANCE OF PARDON AND FORGIVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS.</hi> The greateſt and the trueſt ſorrow of a dying State, is that which is occaſion'd from the ſence of Sin and Guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Hinc illae lacryniae.</hi> This is the cauſe of our chiefeſt trouble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs at that time, and very juſtly too, for it is the moſt diſmal rate as ever was threatned; <note place="margin">St. <hi>John</hi> 8. 24.</note>
               <hi>Ye ſhall die in your ſins.</hi> But when I come with a meſſage of Pardon and Forgiveneſs, and this be <note place="margin">St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 2.</note>rightly receiv'd and well grounded, then 'tis <hi>Son be of good chear, thy ſins be forgiven thee.</hi> To be convinc'd that I have made my peace with God, and that my Pardon is ſealed in Heaven, this will ſtrengthen us in the midſt of ſorrows, even to the defiance of all pain and anguiſh: Inſtead of complaints, we may hereupon joyfully ſay, <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace.</hi> I do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care nor value what I ſuffer, ſo I be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to God, and have my ſins waſh'd away by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44766:16"/>
the Blood of Chriſt. And ſuch may be the ſtate of every one of us, for upon a ſincere Faith and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 7.</note>hearty Repentance, <hi>God will have mercy upon us, and abundantly pardon. Though your ſins be as ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 18.</note>
               <hi>they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> This bleſſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe takes away the <hi>ſting of death,</hi> and puts us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of its terrour and malignity; and therefore our Church may well preſcribe it as the great, or only comfort, and ſecurity, in ſuch a ſtate or condition. Thus ſaying, <hi>The Almighty Lord,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Viſit. of Sick.</note>
               <hi>who is a moſt ſtrong Tower to all them that put their truſt in him, to whom all things in heaven, in earth, and under the earth, do bow and obey, be now and evermore they defence, and make thee know and feel, that there is no other name under Heaven given to</hi> Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>in whom, and through whom, thou mayeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive health and ſalvation, but only the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Seventh, and laſt comfortable Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that we have againſt the great ſorrows of Death is.</hi> THE ATTENDANCE OF GODS HOLY ANGELS READY TO RECEI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LS AND TO COND<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CT THEM INTO THE MANSION OF THE BLESSED.

The bleſſed God whoſe inſtruments the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are (and who is therefore alone to be ador'd for it) hath out of wonderful condeſcenſion towards us, aſſign'd thoſe glorious happy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for our ſafety and protection in our dying Strength and Difficulties.
