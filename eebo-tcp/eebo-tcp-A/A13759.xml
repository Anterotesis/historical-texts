            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Take confidence from your Lordships goodnesse, in the very entrance of this Epistle, to professe, with Simplicitie, and according to the faith I owe my Master now in Heauen, That it is not vnto your selfe, but to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Father, that I Dedicate this my Labour, such as it is. For neither am I at liberty to make choice of one, to whom I may present it as a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Oblation, being bound in duty to bring it in as an Account, to him, by whose Indulgence, I had both the time, and Ammunition to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it: Nor if such Obligation were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, know I any to whom I ought to Dedicate it rather. For by the experience of many yeeres I had the honour to serue him, I know this, There was not any, who more really, and lesse for Glories sake, fauoured those that studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Liberall Arts</hi> liberally, then My Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:18271:3"/>
your Father did; nor in whose house a man should lesse need the Vniuersity, then in his. For his own studie, it was bestowed, for the most part, in that kind of Learning, which best deserueth the paines and houres of Great Persons, <hi>History,</hi> and <hi>Ciuill knowledge,</hi> and directed not to the Ostentation of his reading, but to the Gouernment of his Life, and the Publike good. For he so read, that the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he tooke in by study, by iudgement he dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, and conuerted into Wisdome, and ability to benefit his Countrey; to which also hee applyed himselfe with Zeale, but such as tooke no fire, either from <hi>Faction</hi> or <hi>Ambition.</hi> And as he was a most able man, for soundnesse of aduice, and cleere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of himselfe, in matters of difficulty and consequence, both in publike and priuate; so also was he one whom no man was able either to draw, or iustle out of the straight path of Iustice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of which vertue I know not whether hee deserued more, by his seuerity, in imposing it (as he did, to his last breath) on himselfe, or by his Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in not exacting it to himselfe from others. No man better discerned of <hi>Men</hi>; and therefore was he constant in his Friendships, because he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not the <hi>Fortune,</hi> nor <hi>Adhaerence,</hi> but the <hi>Men</hi>; with whom also he conuersed with an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, that had no other guard then his owne Integrity, and that <hi>Nil Conscire.</hi> To his <hi>Equalles</hi> hee carried himselfe equally; and to his inferiours familiarly; but maintaining his Respect fully, and onely, with the natiue splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his worth. In summe, hee was one in whom might plainely bee perceiued, that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi> are but the same thing, in
<pb facs="tcp:18271:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the different degrees of persons. To <hi>him</hi> therefore, and to the memory of <hi>his</hi> worth, be consecrated this, though vnworthy Offering.</p>
            <p>And now, imitating in this <hi>Ciuill Worship,</hi> the <hi>Religious worship</hi> of the Gentiles, who when they Dedicated any thing to their Gods, brought and presented the same to their Images; I bring &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this Guift of mine, <hi>the History of</hi> THVCYDIDES translated into English, with much more diligence then elegance, to your Lordship, who are the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of your Father, (for neuer was a man more exactly coppied out, then he in you,) and who haue in you the seeds of his vertues already springing vp. Humbly intreating your Lordship to esteeme it amongst the Goods that descend vpon you, and in your due time to read it. I could recommend the Author vnto you, not impertinently, for that he had in his veynes the blood of Kings; but I chuse rather to recommend him for his writings, as hauing in them profitable instruction for Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and such as may come to haue the mannaging of great and waighty actions. For I may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently say, that notwithstanding the excellent both Examples and Precepts of Heroique Vertue you haue at home, this Booke will conferre not a little to your institution; especially, when you come to the yeeres, to frame your life by your owne Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. For in <hi>History,</hi> actions of <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour</hi> doe appeare plainely and distinctly, which are which; but in the present Age they are so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised, that few there bee, and those very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that bee not grossely mistaken in them. But this, I doubt not, is superfluously spoken by mee to your Lordship: Therefore I end with
<pb facs="tcp:18271:4"/>
this prayer, That it will please God to giue you Vertues sutable to the faire dwelling he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them, and the happinesse that such Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues leade vnto, both in, and after this world.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough this <hi>Translation</hi> haue already past the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of some, whose Iudgements I very much esteeme; yet, because there is something, I know not what, in the censure of a Multitude, more terrible then any single Iudgement, how seuere or exact soeuer, I haue thought it discretion in all men, that haue to doe with so many, and to me, in my want of perfection, necessary, to bespeake your Candor. Which that I may vpon the better reason hope for, I am willing to acquaint you briefly, vpon what grounds I vndertooke this Worke at first; and haue since, by publishing it, put my selfe vpon the hazard of your censure, with so small hope of glory, as from a thing of this nature can be expected. For I know, that meere Translations, haue in them this property, that they may much disgrace, if not well done; but if well, not much commend the doer.</p>
            <p>It hath beene noted by diuers, that <hi>Homer</hi> in <hi>Poesie, Aristotle</hi> in <hi>Philosophy, Demosthenes</hi> in <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and others of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, in other knowledge, doe still maintaine their Primacy, none of them exceeded, some not approached, by any, in these later Ages. And in the number of these, is iustly ranked also our <hi>Thucydides;</hi> a Workeman no lesse perfect in his worke, then any of the former; and in whom (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue with many others) the Faculty of writing History is at the highest. For the <hi>principall</hi> and <hi>proper worke</hi> of History, being to instruct, and enable men, by the knowledge of Actions <hi>past,</hi> to beare themselues prudently in the <hi>present,</hi> and prouidently towards the <hi>Future,</hi> there is not extant any other (meerely humane) that doth more fully, and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performe it, then this of my Author. It is true, that there be many excellent and profitable Histories written since; and in some of them, there be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted very wise discourses, both of <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Policie.</hi> But being discourses inserted, and not of the contexture of the Narration, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed commend the knowledge of the Writer, but not the History it selfe, the nature whereof, is meerely narratiue. In others, there bee subtile coniectures, at the secret aymes, and inward cogitations of such as fall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Penne; which is also none of the least vertues in a History,
<pb facs="tcp:18271:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where the coniecture is throughly grounded, not forced to serue the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Writer, in adorning his stile, or manifesting his subtilty in coniecturing. But these coniectures cannot often be certaine, vnlesse withall so euident, that the narration it selfe may be sufficient to suggest the same also to the Reader. But <hi>Thucydides</hi> is one, who, though he neuer digresse to reade a Lecture, Morall or Politicall, vpon his owne Text, nor enter into mens hearts, further then the actions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues euidently guide him, is yet accounted the most Politique Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher that euer writ. The reason whereof I take to bee this: He fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his Narrations with that choice of matter, and ordereth them with that Iudgement, and with such perspicuity and efficacy expresseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, he maketh his <hi>Auditor</hi> a <hi>Spectator.</hi> For he settteh his Reader in the <hi>Assemblies</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and in the <hi>Senates,</hi> at their debating; in the <hi>Streets,</hi> at their Seditions; and in the <hi>Field</hi> at their Battels. So that looke how much a man of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, might haue added to his experience, if he had then liued, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of their proceedings, and familiar with the men, and businesse of the time; so much almost may he profit now, by attentiue reading of the same here written. He may from the narrations draw out lessons to himselfe, and of himselfe be able, to trace the drifts and counsailes of the Actors to their seate.</p>
            <p>These Vertues of my Author did so take my affection, that they begat in me a desire to communicate him further; which was the first occasion that moued mee to translate him. For it is an errour we easily fall into, to beleeue, that whatsoeuer pleaseth vs, will be, in like manner and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, acceptable to all; and to esteeme of one anothers Iudgement, as we agree in the liking, or dislike of the same things. And in this errour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture was I, when I thought, that as many of the more iudicious, as I should communicate him to, would affect him as much as I my selfe did. I considered also, that he was exceedingly esteemed of the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> in their owne Tongues; notwithstanding that he bee not very much beholding for it to his Interpreters. Of whom (to speake no more then becomes a Candidate of your good opinion in the same kinde) I may say this, That whereas the Author himselfe, so carrieth with him his owne light throughout, that the Reader may continually see his way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and by that which goeth before, expect what is to follow, I found it not so in them. The cause whereof, and their excuse may bee this: They followed the <hi>Latine</hi> of <hi>Laurentius Valla,</hi> which was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some errours, and he a <hi>Greeke</hi> Copie, not so correct as now is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. Out of <hi>French</hi> hee was done into <hi>English,</hi> (for I neede not dissemble to haue seene him in <hi>English</hi>) in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth; but so, as by multiplication of errour, hee became at length
<pb facs="tcp:18271:5"/>
traduced, rather then translated into our Language. Hereupon I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to take him immediately from the <hi>Greeke,</hi> according to the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aemilius Porta;</hi> not refusing, or neglecting any version, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or other helpe I could come by. Knowing that when with <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> and <hi>Leasure</hi> I should haue done it, though some error might re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maine, yet they would be errors but of one descent; of which neuerthelesse I can discouer none, and hope they bee not many. After I had finished it, it lay long by mee, and other reasons taking place, my desire to communi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cate it ceased.</p>
            <p>For I saw, that, for the greatest part, men came to the reading of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, with an affection much like that of the <hi>People,</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> who came to the spectacle of the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> with more delight to behold their bloud, then their Skill in Fencing. For they be farre more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that loue to read of great Armies, bloudy Battels, and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands slaine at once, then that minde the <hi>Art,</hi> by which, the Affaires, both of Armies, and Cities, be conducted to their ends. I obserued like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that there were not many, whose eares were well accustomed to the names of the places they shall meet with in this Histroy; without the knowledge whereof, it can neither patiently be read ouer, perfectly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, nor easily remembred; Especially being many, as heere it falleth out; because in that Age, almost euery City, both in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> the two maine scenes of this Warre, was a distinct Common wealth by it selfe, and a party in the Quarrell.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse I haue thought since, that the former of these conside<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rations ought not to be of any weight at all, to him that can content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the <hi>Few</hi> and <hi>better</hi> sort of Readers; who, as they onley iudge, so is their approbation onely considerable. And for the difficulty arising from the ignorance of places, I thought it not so insuperable, but that with conuenient pictures of the Countries it might be remoaed. To which purpose, I saw there would be necessary, especially two; a Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rall Mappe of <hi>Greece,</hi> and a Generall Mappe of <hi>Sicily.</hi> The latter of these, I found already extant, exactly done, by <hi>Philip Cluuerius;</hi> which I haue caused to be cut, and you haue it at the beginning of the Sixth Booke. But for Mappes of <hi>Greece,</hi> sufficient for this purpose, I could light on none. For neither are the <hi>Tables</hi> of <hi>Ptolomie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of those that follow him, accommodate to the time of <hi>Thucydides</hi>; and therefore few of the Places by him mentioned, therein described: nor are those that bee, agreeing alwayes with the truth of History. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was constrained to draw one (as well as I could) my selfe. Which to doe, I was to rely, for the maine Figure of the Countrey, on the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne description now in reputation; and in that to set downe those Places especially (as many as the Volume was capable of) which occurre in the
<pb facs="tcp:18271:6"/>
reading of this Author, and to assigne them that situation, which, by trauell in <hi>Strabo, Pausanias, Herodotus,</hi> and some other good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, I saw belonged vnto them. And to shew you that I haue not played the Mountibanke in it, putting downe exactly some few of the Principall, and the rest at aduenture, without care, and without reason, I haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Mappe an <hi>Index,</hi> that pointeth to the Authors which will iustifie me, where I differ from others. With these Mappes, and those few briefe notes in the Margine, vpon such passages, as I thought most required them, I supposed the History might be read with very much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, by all men of good Iudgement and Education, (for whom also it was intended from the beginning by <hi>Thucydides)</hi> and haue therefore at length made my Labour publike, not without hope to haue it accepted. Which if I obtaine, though no otherwise then in vertue of the Authors excellent matter, it is sufficient.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee reade of diuers men that beare the name of <hi>Thucydides.</hi> There is <hi>Thucydides</hi> a <hi>Pharsalian,</hi> mentioned in the eighth Booke of this History; who was publike Hoste of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> in <hi>Pharsalus,</hi> and chancing to be at <hi>Athens,</hi> at the time that the gouernment of the 400 began to goe downe, by his interposition, and perswasion, kept asunder the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> then arming themselues, that they fought not in the City to the ruine of the Common-wealth. There is <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi> the son of <hi>Milesias,</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> of the towne of <hi>Alope,</hi> of whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaketh in the Life of <hi>Pericles</hi>; and the same in all probabilitie, that in the first Book of this History, is said to haue had the charge of 40 Gallies, sent against <hi>Samos,</hi> about 24 yeeres before the beginning of this Warre. Another <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ariston,</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> also, of the Towne of <hi>Acherdus,</hi> was a Poet, though of his verses there be nothing extant. But <hi>Thucydides</hi> the writer of this History, an <hi>Athenian,</hi> of the Towne of <hi>Halimus,</hi> was the sonne of <hi>Olorus,</hi> (or <hi>Orolus</hi>) and <hi>Hegesipyle.</hi> His Fathers name is commonly written <hi>Olorus</hi> though in the Inscription on his Tombe, it was <hi>Orolus.</hi> Howsoeuer it be written, it is the same that was borne by diuers of the Kings of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and imposed on him, with respect vnto his descent from them. So that though our Author (as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith of him <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>De Oratore</hi>) had neuer written an History, yet had not his name not bin extant, in regard of his Honour and Nobility. And not onely <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Cimon,</hi> but also almost all others that haue touched this point, affirme directly that he was descended from the <hi>Thracian</hi> Kings. Adducing this for proofe, that he was of the house of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> that famous Generall of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> against the <hi>Persians</hi> at <hi>Marathon</hi>; which they also proue by this, that his Tombe was a long time extant amongst the Monuments of that Family. For neere vnto the Gates of <hi>Athens,</hi> called <hi>Melirides,</hi> there was a place named <hi>Coela,</hi> and in it the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments called <hi>Cintoniana,</hi> belonging to the Family of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> in which, none but such as were of that Family, might be buried. And amongst those was the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> with this inscription, <hi>Thucydides Oroli Halimusius.</hi> Now <hi>Miltiades</hi> is confessed by all, to haue descended from <hi>Olorus,</hi> King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> whose daughter another <hi>Miltiades,</hi> Grandfather to this, married, and had children by. And <hi>Miltiades,</hi> that wonne the memorable victory at <hi>Marathon,</hi> was heire to goodly possessions, and Cities in the <hi>Chersonnesus</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> ouer which also hee raigne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. In <hi>Thrace</hi> lay also the possessions of <hi>Thucydides</hi> and his wealthy Mines of Gold, as he himselfe professeth in his fourth Booke. And although those riches might come to him by a Wife (as is also by some affirmed) which he married in <hi>Scapte-Hyle,</hi> a City of <hi>Thrace,</hi> yet euen by that marriage, it appeareth, that his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires had a relation to that Countrey, and that his Nobility was not there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. But in what degree of kindred <hi>Miltiades,</hi> and he, approached each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not any where made manifest. Some also haue coniectured that hee was of the house of the <hi>Pisistratides</hi>; the ground of whose coniecture hath beene onely this, that he maketh honourable mention of the gouernment of <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> and his sonnes, and extenuateth the glory of <hi>Harmodius</hi> and <hi>Aristogiton</hi>; prouing that the free<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng of the State of <hi>Athens</hi> from the tyranny of the <hi>Pisistratides,</hi> was falsly ascribed to their fact (which proceeded from priuate reuenge, in a quarrel of Loue) by which the tyranny ceased not, but grew heauier to the State, till it was at last put
<pb facs="tcp:18271:7"/>
downe by the <hi>Lacedaemoniaus.</hi> But this opinion, as it is not so well grounded, so neither is it so well receiued as the former.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to his Nobility, was his institution in the study of <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>· For in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> he was the Scholler (as also was <hi>Pericles</hi> and <hi>Socrates)</hi> of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In some places of his History, hee noteth the aequiuocation of the Oracles; and yet hee confirmeth an asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> touching the time this Warre lasted, by the Oracles predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

Yet he commendeth him in another place for his worshipping of the <hi>Gods,</hi> and saith in that respect, hee least of all men deserued to come to so great a degree of Calamity as he did.

Insomuch as in his latter dayes he liued retyred, but so as he gaue counsell to, and writ Orations for other men that resorted vnto him, to that purpose. It was he that contriued the deposing of the <hi>People,</hi> and the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of the gouernment of the 400.

               </hi> againe recouered their authority; notwithstanding that he pleaded his owne cause, the best of any man to that day.</p>
            <p>It need not be doubted, but from such a Master, <hi>Thucydides</hi> was sufficiently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, to haue become a great Demagogue, and of great authority with the <hi>People.</hi> But it seemeth he had no desire at all to meddle in the gouernment, because in those ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s it was impossible for any man to giue good and profitable counsell for the Common-wealth and not incurre the displeasure of the <hi>People</hi> For their opinion was such of their owne power, and of the facility of atchieuing whatsoeuer acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they vndertooke, that such men onely swayed the Assemblies, and were estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se and good Common-wealths men, as did put them vpon the most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and desperate enterprizes. Whereas he that gaue them temperate, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet aduice, was thought a Coward, or not to vnderstand, or else to maligne their power. And no maruell; for much prosperity (to which they had now for many yeeres been accustomed) maketh men in loue with themselues; and it is hard for any man to loue that counsell which maketh him loue himselfe the lesse. And it holdeth much more in a Multitude, then in one Man; For a man that reasoneth with himselfe, will not be ashamed to admit of timerous suggestions in his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that he may the stronglyer prouide; but in publique deliberations before a Multitude, Feare, (which for the most part aduiseth well, though it execute not so) seldome or neuer sheweth it selfe, or is admitted. By this meanes it came to passe amongst the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who thought they were able to doe any thing, that wicked men and flatterers draue them headlong into those actions that were to ruine them; and the good men either durst not oppose, or if they did, vndid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. <hi>Thucydides</hi> therefore, that he might not be either of them that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or of them that suffered euill, forbore to come into the Assemblies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to himselfe, a priuate life as farre as the eminency of so wealthy a person, and the writing of the History he had vndertaken, would permit.</p>
            <p>For his opinion touching the gouernment of the State, it is manifest that he least of all liked the <hi>Democracy.</hi> And vpon diuers occasions, hee noteth the emulation and contention of the Demagogues, for reputation, and glory of wit; with their crossing of each others counsels to the dammage of the Publique; the inconstancy
<pb facs="tcp:18271:7"/>
of Resolutions, caused by the diuersity of ends, and power of Rhetorique in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators; and the desperate actions vndertaken vpon the flattering aduice of such as desired to attaine, or to hold what they had attained of authority and sway a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the common people. Nor doth it appeare, that he magnifieth any where the authority of the <hi>Few</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amongst whom he saith euery one desireth to be chiefe, and they that are vnderualued, beare it with lesse patience then in a <hi>Democracy</hi>; whereupon sedition followeth, and dissolution of the gouernment. Hee prayseth the gouernment of <hi>Athens,</hi> when it was mixt of the <hi>Few</hi> and the <hi>Many</hi>; but more he commendeth it, both when <hi>Pisistratus</hi> raigned (sauing that it was an vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped power) and when in the beginning of this Warre, it was <hi>Democraticall</hi> in name, but in effect <hi>Monarchicall</hi> vnder <hi>Pericles.</hi> So that it seemeth that as he was of Regall descent, so he best approued of the <hi>Regall Gouernment.</hi> It is therefore no maruell, if he meddled as little as he could in the businesse of the Common-wealth, but gaue himselfe rather to the obseruation and recording of what was done by those that had the mannaging thereof. Which also he was no lesse prompt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and faithfull by the disposition of his mind, then by his fortune, dignity, and wisedome, able to accomplish. How he was disposed to a worke of this nature, may be vnderstood by this, that when being a young man he heard <hi>Herodotus</hi> the Historiographer reciting his History in Publique, (for such was the fashion both of that, and many Ages after) he felt so great a sting of aemulation, that it drew teares from him, insomuch as <hi>Herodotus</hi> himselfe tooke notice how violently his mind was set on letters, and told his Father <hi>Olorus.</hi> When the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> Warre began to breake out, he coniectured truely, that it would prooue an Argument worthy his labour; and no sooner it began, then he began his History; pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, not in that perfect manner, in which we see it now, but by way of Commentary, or plaine Register of the Actions and passages thereof, as from time to time they fell out, and came to his knowledge. But such a Commentary it was, as might perhaps deserue to be preferr'd before a History written by another. For it is very probable that the eighth Booke is left the same it was when he first writ it, neither beautified with <hi>Orations,</hi> nor so well Cemented at the <hi>Transitions,</hi> as the former seuen Bookes are. And though he began to write as soone as euer the Warre was on foot, yet began he not to perfect and polish his History, till after he was banished.</p>
            <p>For notwithstanding his retyred life vpon the Coast of <hi>Thrace,</hi> where his owne possessions lay, he could not auoyd a seruice of the State, which proued to him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards very vnfortunate. For whilest he resided in the Ile <hi>Thasus,</hi> it fell out that <hi>Brasidas</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> besieged <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> a Citie belonging to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> on the Confines of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Macedony,</hi> distant from <hi>Thasus,</hi> about halfe a dayes sayle. To relieue which, the Captaine thereof for the <hi>Athenians,</hi> sent to <hi>Tbucydides,</hi> to leuy a power and make haste vnto him, (for <hi>Thucydides</hi> was one of the <hi>Strategi,</hi> that is, had authority to raise forces in those parts, for the seruice of the Common-wealth.) And he did accordingly. But he came thither one night too late, and found the City already yeelded vp. And for this he was afterwards banished, as if he had let slip his time through negligence, or purposely put it off, vpon feare of the Enemy. Neuerthelesse he put himselfe into the Citie of <hi>Eion,</hi> and preserued it to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> with the repulse of <hi>Brasidas,</hi> which came downe from <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> the next morning, and assaulted it. The author of his banishment is supposed to haue been <hi>Gleon,</hi> a most violent Sycophant in those times, and thereby also a most acceptable Speaker amongst the people. For where affaires succeed amisse, though there want neither prouidence, nor cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in the Conduction, yet with those that iudge onely vpon euents, the way to calumny is alwayes open, and <hi>Enuy,</hi> in the likenesse of <hi>Zeale</hi> to the Publique good, easily findeth credit for an accusation.</p>
            <p>After his Banishment he liued in <hi>Scapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-Hyle,</hi> a Citie of <hi>Thrace,</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth; but yet so as he went abroad; and was present at the Actions of the rest of the Warre as appeareth by his owne words in his fift Booke. Where he saith, that he was present at the Actions of both parts, and no lesse at those of the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> by reason of his exile, then those of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> During this time also, he perfected his History, so far as is now to be seene; nor doth
<pb facs="tcp:18271:8"/>
it appeare that after his exile, he euer againe enioyed his Countrey. It is not cleere in any Author, where, or when, or in what yeere of his owne Age, he dyed. Most agree that he dyed in Banishment; yet there be that haue written, that after the defeat in <hi>Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> decreed a generall reuocation of all banished persons, except those of the Family of <hi>Pisistratus</hi>; and that he then returned, and was afterwards put to death at <hi>Athens.</hi> But this is very vnlikely to be true, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse by <hi>after</hi> the defeat in <hi>Sicily,</hi> he meant <hi>so long after,</hi> that it was also after the end of the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> Warre, because <hi>Thucydides</hi> himselfe maketh no mention of such returne, though he out-liued the whole War, as is manifest by his words in the fift Booke. For he saith he liued in banishment twenty yeeres after his charge at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phipolis</hi>; which happened in the eighth yeere of this Warre, which in the whole, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted but 27 yeeres compleat. And in another place he maketh mention of the razing of the <hi>Long-walles</hi> betweene <hi>Peiraeus,</hi> and the Citie; which was the last stroke of this Warre. They that say he dyed at <hi>Athens,</hi> take their coniecture from his Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was there. But this is not a sufficient Argument; for he might bee buried there secretly, (as some haue written he was) though he dyed abroad; or his Monument might be there, and (as others haue affirmed) he not buried in it. In this variety of coniecture there is nothing more probable then that which is written by <hi>Pausanias,</hi> where he describeth the Monuments of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Citie, and saith thus. <hi>The worthy Act of</hi> Oenobius, <hi>in the behalfe of</hi> Thucydides, <hi>is not without honour</hi> (meaning that he had a Statue.) <hi>For</hi> Oenobius <hi>obtained to haue a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree passed for his returne; who returning was slaine by treachery, and his Sepulchre is neere the Gates called</hi> Melirides. He dyed, as saith <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> after the seuen and fiftieth yeere of his Age. And if it be true that is written by <hi>A. Gellius,</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Hellanicus, Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Thucydides,</hi> then died he not before the sixty eighth yeere. For if he were forty when the Warre began, and liued (as he did, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to see it ended he might be more when he dyed, but not lesse then sixty eight yeeres of Age. What children be left, is not manifest. <hi>Plato in Menone,</hi> maketh mention of <hi>Milesias</hi> and <hi>Stephanus,</hi> sonnes of a <hi>Thucydides,</hi> of a very Noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but it is cleere that they were of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> the Riuall of <hi>Pericles,</hi> both by the name <hi>Milesias,</hi> and because this <hi>Thucydides</hi> also, was of the Family of <hi>Milti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fieth in the Life of <hi>Cimon.</hi> That he had a sonne, is affirmed by <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> out of the authority of <hi>Polemon,</hi> but of his name there is no mention, saue that a learned man readeth there, in the place of <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Now for his writings, two things are to bee considered in them, <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Eloquution.</hi> For in <hi>Truth</hi> consisteth the <hi>Soule,</hi> and in <hi>Eloquution</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. The latter without the former, is but a picture of History; and the former without the latter, vnapt to instruct. But let vs see how our Author hath acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe in both. For the Faith of this History, I shall haue the lesse to say, in respect that no man hath euer yet called it into question. Nor indeed could any man iustly doubt of the truth of that Writer, in whom they had nothing at all to suspect of those things that could haue caused him either voluntarily to lie, or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly to deliuer an vntruth. He ouertasked not himselfe by vndertaking an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of things done long before his time, and of which he was not able to informe himselfe. He was a man that had as much meanes, in regard both of his dignity and wealth, to find the truth of what he relateth, as was needfull for a man to haue. He vsed as much diligence in search of the truth, (noting euery thing whilest it was fresh in memory, and laying out his wealth vpon intelligence,) as was possible for a man to vse. He affected least of any man the acclamations of Popular Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and wrote not his History to win present applause, as was the vse of that Age, but for a Monument to instruct the Ages to come. Which he professeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and Entitleth his Booke <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>A Posses<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion for euerlasting.</hi> He was farre from the necessity of seruile Writers, either to feare or flatter. And whereas he may peraduenture be thought to haue beene maleuolent towards his Countrey, because they deserued to haue him so, yet hath he not written any thing that discouereth any such passion. Nor is there any thing written of them that tendeth to their dishonour, as <hi>Athenians,</hi> but onely as <hi>People</hi>; and that by the necessity of the narration, not by any sought digression. So that no word of his,
<pb facs="tcp:18271:8"/>
but their own actions do sometimes reproach them. In summe, if the truth of a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story did euer appeare by the manner of relating, it doth so in this History; So co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerent, perspicuous and perswasiue is the whole Narration, and euery part therof.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Eloquution</hi> also; Two things are considerable, <hi>Disposition</hi> or <hi>Method,</hi> and <hi>Stile.</hi> Of the <hi>Disposition</hi> here vsed by <hi>Thucydides,</hi> it will be sufficient in this place, briefly to obserue onely this. That in his first Booke, first he hath by way of <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> deriued the State of <hi>Greece</hi> from the Cradle, to the vigorous stature it then was at, when he began to write; and next, declared the causes, both <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> of the Warre hee was to write of, In the rest, in which hee handleth the Warre it selfe, he followeth distinctly and purely the order of time throughout; relating what came to passe from yeere to yeere, and subdiuiding each yeere into a Summer and Winter. The grounds and motiues of euery action, he setteth down before the action it selfe, either Narratiuely, or else contriueth them into the forme of <hi>Deliberatiue Orations,</hi> in the persons of such as from time to time bare sway in the Common-wealth. After the actions, when there is iust occasion, he giueth his iudgement of them, shewing by what meanes the successe came either to be furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or hindered. Digressions for instructions cause, and other such open conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Precepts (which is the Philosophers part) he neuer vseth, as hauing so cleerely set before mens eyes, the wayes and euents, of good and euill counsels, that the Narration it selfe doth secretly instruct the Reader, and more effectually then possibly can be done by Precept.</p>
            <p>For his <hi>Stile,</hi> I referre it to the iudgement of diuers antient and competent Iudges. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Booke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>De gloria Atheniensium,</hi> saith of him thus. Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides <hi>aymeth alwayes at this, to make his Auditor a Spectator, and to cast his Reader into the same passions that they were in, that were beholders. The manner how</hi> Demost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes <hi>aranged the</hi> Athenians <hi>on the rugged shore before</hi> Pylus. <hi>How</hi> Brasidas <hi>vrged the Steeresman to runne his Gally a ground; how he went to the Ladder, or place in the Gally for descent, how he was hurt, and swowned, and fell downe on the ledges of the Gally; how the</hi> Spartans <hi>fought after the manner of a Land-fight vpon the Sea, and the</hi> Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>of a Sea-fight vpon Land. Againe, in the</hi> Sicilian <hi>Warre, how a battell was fought by Sea and Land, with equall fortune. These things, I say, are so described, and so euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set before our eyes, that the mind of the Reader is no lesse affected therewith, then if hee had beene present in the Actions.</hi> There is for his perspecuity. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Booke entituled <hi>Orator,</hi> speaking of the affection of diuers <hi>Greeke</hi> Rhetoricians, saith thus. <hi>And therefore</hi> Herodotus <hi>and</hi> Thucydides <hi>are the more admirable. For though they liued in the same Age with those J haue before named, (meaning</hi> Thrasymachus, Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, <hi>and</hi> Theodorus) <hi>yet were they farre from this kind of delicacy, or rather indeed f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olery. For the one without rubbe, gently glideth like a still River, and the other (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> Thucydides) <hi>runnes stronglier, and in matter of Warre, as it were, bloweth a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of Warre. And in these two (as saith</hi> Theophrastus) <hi>History hath rowsed her selfe, and aduentured to speake, both more copiously, and with more ornament then in those that were before them.</hi> This commends the grauity, and the dignity of his language. Againe in his second Booke, <hi>De Oratore,</hi> thus. Thucydides <hi>in the Art of speaking, hath in my opinion far exceeded them all. For he is so full of matter, that the number of his sentences, doth almost reach to the number of his words; and in his words he is so apt, and so close, that it is hard to say, whether his words do more illustrate his sentences, or his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences his words.</hi> There is for the pithinesse and strength of his Stile. Lastly, for the purity, and propriety, I cite, <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassius,</hi> whose testimony is the stronger in this point, because he was a <hi>Greeke</hi> Rhetorician for his faculty, and for his affection, one that would no further commend him, then of necessity he must. His words are these. <hi>There is one vertue in Eloquence, the chiefest of all the rest, and without which there is no other goodnesse in speech. What is that? That the language be pure and retaine the propriety of the</hi> Greeke <hi>tongue. This they both obserue diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For</hi> Herodotus <hi>is the best rule of the</hi> Ionique, <hi>and</hi> Thucydides <hi>of the</hi> Attique <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect.</hi> These testimonies are not needfull to him that hath read the History it selfe, nor at all, but that this same <hi>Dionysius</hi> hath taken so much paines, and applyed so much of his faculty in Rhetorique to the extenuating of the worth thereof; More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, I haue thought it necessary to take out the principall obiections he maketh against him, and without many words of mine owne, to leaue them to the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb facs="tcp:18271:9"/>
of the Reader. And first <hi>Dionysius</hi> saith thus. <hi>The principall, and most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary office of any man that intendeth to write a History, is to chuse a Noble Argument, and gratefull to such as shall reade it. And this,</hi> Herodotus, <hi>in my opinion, hath done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then</hi> Thucydides. <hi>For</hi> Herodotus <hi>hath written the ioynt History, both of the</hi> Greekes <hi>and</hi> Barbarians, <hi>to saue from obliuion, &amp;c. But</hi> Thucydides <hi>writeth one onely Warre, and that neither honourable, nor fortunate; which principally were to bee wished neuer to haue beene; and next, neuer to haue been remembred, nor knowne to posterity. And that he tooke an euill Argument in hand, he maketh it manifest in his proeme, saying,</hi> That many Cities were in that Warre made desolate, and vtterly destroyed, partly by <hi>Barbarians,</hi> partly by the <hi>Greekes</hi> themselues: so many banishments, and so much slaughter of men as neuer was the like before, &amp;c. <hi>So that the hearers will abhorre it, at the first propounding. Now by how much it is better to write of the wonderfull acts both of the</hi> Barbarians, <hi>and</hi> Grecians, <hi>then of the pittifull and horrible calamities of the</hi> Grecians, <hi>so much wiser is</hi> Herodotus <hi>in the choyce of his Argument, then</hi> Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides.</p>
            <p>Now let any man consider whether it be not more reasonable to say. <hi>That the principall, &amp; most necessary office of him that will write a History, is to take such an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as is both within his power well to handle, and profitable to posterity that shall reade it. Which</hi> Thucydides, <hi>in the opinion of all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath done better then</hi> Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. <hi>For</hi> Herodotus <hi>vndertooke to write of those things, of which it was impossible for him to know the truth; and which delight more the eare with fabulous Narrations, then satisfie the mind with truth. But</hi> Thucydides <hi>writeth one Warre, which, how it was carried from the beginning to the end, he was able certainely to informe himselfe. And by propounding in his Proeme, the miseries that happened in the same, he sheweth that it was a great Warre, and worthy to be knowne, and not to be concealed from posterity, for the calamities that then fell vpon the</hi> Grecians; <hi>but the rather to be truely deliuered vnto them for that men profit more by looking on aduerse euents, then on prosperity. Therefore by how much mens miseries doe better instruct, then their good successe, by so much was</hi> Thucydides <hi>more happy in taking his Argument, then</hi> Herodotus <hi>was wise in chusing his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionysius</hi> againe, saith thus. <hi>The next office of him that will write a History, is to know where to begin, and where to end. And in this point</hi> Herodotus <hi>seemeth to be farre more discrect then</hi> Thucydides. <hi>For in the first place he layeth downe the cause, for which the</hi> Barbarians <hi>began to iniure the</hi> Grecians; <hi>and going on, maketh an end at the punishment, and the reuenge taken on the</hi> Barbarians. <hi>But</hi> Thucydides <hi>begins at the good estate of the</hi> Grecians, <hi>which being a</hi> Grecian, <hi>and an</hi> Athenian, <hi>he ought not to haue done; nor ought he, being of that dignity amongst the</hi> Athenians, <hi>so euidently to haue laid the fault of the Warre vpon his owne City, when there were other occasions enough to which he might haue imputed it. Nor ought he to haue begun with the businesse of the</hi> Corcyraeans, <hi>but at the more Noble Acts of his Countrey, which they did immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the</hi> Persian <hi>Warre, (which afterward in conuenient place he mentioneth, but it is but cursorily, and not as he ought.) And when he had declared those, with much affection, as a louer of his Countrey, then he should haue brought in, how that the</hi> Lacedaemonians, <hi>through enuy and feare, but pretending other causes, began the Warre, and so haue descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the</hi> Corcyraean <hi>businesse, and the Decree against the</hi> Megareans, <hi>or whatsoeuer else he had to put in. Then in the ending of his History, there be many errours committed. For though he professe he was present in the whole warre, and that he would write it all, yet he ends with the Nauall battell at</hi> Cynossema, <hi>which was fought in the</hi> 21 <hi>yeere of the warre; whereas it had beene better to haue gone through with it, and ended his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with that admirable, and gratefull returne of the banished</hi> Athenians <hi>from</hi> Phile, <hi>at which time the City recouered her liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I say. <hi>That it was the duty of him that had vndertaken to write the History of the</hi> Peloponnesian <hi>VVarre, to begin his Narration no further of, then at the causes of the same, whether the</hi> Grecians <hi>were then in good, or in euill estate. And if the iniury, vpon which the warre arose, proceeded from the</hi> Athenians, <hi>then the writer, though an</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian, <hi>and honoured in his Countrey, ought to declare the same, and not to seeke, nor take, though at hand, any other occasion to transferre the fault. And that the Acts done before the time comprehended in the warre he writ of, ought to haue been touched but cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorily, and no more then may serue for the enlightning of the History to follow, how Noble
<pb facs="tcp:18271:9"/>
soeuer those Acts haue beene. Which when he had thus touched, without affection to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, and not as a louer of his Countrey, but of truth, then to haue proceeded to the rest, with the like indifferency, And to haue made an end of writing, where the Warre ended, which he vndertooke to write; not producing his History beyond that period, though that which followed were neuer so admirable and acceptable.</hi> All this <hi>Thucydides</hi> hath obserued.</p>
            <p>These two criminations, I haue therefore set downe at large, translated almost <hi>verbatim</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the iudgement of <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassius,</hi> may the better appeare, concerning the mayne and principall vertues of a History. I thinke there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer written so much absurdity in so few lines. He is contrary to the opinion of all men that euer spake of this subiect besides himselfe, and to common sense. For he makes the scope of History not profit by writing truth, but delight of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if it were a Song. And the Argument of History, he would not by any meanes haue to containe the calamities and misery of his Countrey, (these he would haue buried in silence) but onely their glorious and splendid actions. Amongst the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of an Historiographer, hee reckons affection to his Countrey; study to please the hearer; to write of more then his Argument leades him to; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale all actions that were not to the honour of his Countrey. Most manifest vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He was a Rhetorician, and it seemeth he would haue nothing written, but that which was most capable of Rhetoricall ornament. Yet <hi>Lucian</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Rhetorician also, in a Treatise, entituled, <hi>How a History ought to be written,</hi> saith thus, <hi>That a writer of History, ought in his writings, to be a forraigner, without Countrey, liuing vnder his owne Law onely, subiect to no King, nor caring what any man will like, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but laying out the matter as it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third fault he finds, is this That the method of his History is gouerned by the time rather then the periods of seuerall actions. For he declares in order what came to passe each Summer, and Winter, and is thereby forced sometimes, to leaue the Narration of a siege, or sedition, or a Warre, or other action, in the middest, and enter into a Relation of somewhat else<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> done at the same time, in another place, and to come to the former againe when the time requires it. This saith hee, causeth confusion in the mind of his hearer, so that he cannot comprehend distinctly the seuerall parts of the History.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionysius</hi> aymeth still at the delight of the <hi>present</hi> hearer; though <hi>Thucydides</hi> himselfe professe that his scope is not that, but to leaue his worke for a <hi>perpetuall possession</hi> to posterity. And then haue men leasure enough to comprehend him throughly. But indeed, whosoeuer shall reade him once attentiuely, shall more distinctly conceiue of euery action this way, then the other; and the method is more naturall; for as much as his purpose being to write of one <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> Warre, this way he hath incorporated all the parts thereof into one body, so that there is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the whole, and the seuerall Narrations are conceiued onely as parts of that; Whereas the other way, he had but sowed together many little Histories, and left the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> Warre (which he tooke for his subiect) in a manner vnwrltten; for neither any part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the whole, could iustly haue carryed such a Title.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he accuseth him for the method of his first Booke, in that he deriueth <hi>Greece,</hi> from the infancy thereof to his owne time; and in that he setteth downe the Narration of the quarrels about <hi>Corcyra,</hi> and <hi>Potidaea,</hi> before he entreateth of the true cause of the Warre, which was the greatnesse of the <hi>Athenian</hi> dominion, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and enuyed by the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For answer to this, I say thus. For the mentioning of the antient State of <hi>Greece,</hi> he doth it briefly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> insisting no longer vpon it then is necessary for the well vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the following History. For without some generall notions of these first times, many places of the History are the lesse easie to be vnderstood, as depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the knowledge of the originall of seuerall Cities and Customes, which could not be at all inserted into the History it selfe, but must be either supposed to before knowne by the reader, or else be deliuered to him in the beginning, as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Preface And for his putting first the Narration of the Publique, and auowed cause of this Warre, and after that the true and inward motiue of the same, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension is absurd. For it is plaine that a cause of Warre, divulged and auowed, how flight soeuer it be, comes within the taske of the Historiographer, no lesse then
<pb facs="tcp:18271:10"/>
the Warre it selfe, for without a pretext, no Warre followes. This prete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes an iniury receiued, or pretended to be receiued. Whereas the inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to hostility is but coniecturall, and not of that euidence, that a Historiographer should be alwayes bound to take notice of it; as enuy to the greatnesse of another State, or feare of an iniury to come. Now let any man iudge, whether a good wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of History, ought to handle, as the principall cause of Warre, proclaimed iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or concealed enuy. In a word the Image of the Method vsed by <hi>Thucydides</hi> in this point, is this. <hi>The Quarrell about</hi> Corcyra, <hi>passed on this manner; and the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell about</hi> Potidaea, <hi>on this manner</hi>; (relating both at large) <hi>and in both, the</hi> Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>were accused to haue done the iniury. Neuerthelesse the</hi> Lacedaemonians <hi>had not vpon this iniury entred into a Warre against them, but that they</hi> enuyed <hi>the greatnesse of their</hi> power, <hi>and</hi> feared <hi>the consequence of their</hi> ambition. I thinke a more cleare, and naturall order cannot possibly be deuised.</p>
            <p>Againe he sayes, that he maketh a Funerall Oration (which was solemnely done on all occasions through the Warre) for 15 Horsemen onely, that were slaine at the Brookes called <hi>Rheiti</hi>; and that for this reason onely, that he might make it in the person of <hi>Pericles,</hi> who was then liuing, but before another the like occasion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, was dead.</p>
            <p>The manner of the <hi>Athenians</hi> was, that they that were slaine the first, in any Warre, should haue a solemne Funerall, in the suburbs of the Citie. During this Warre, they had many occasions to put this custome in practise. Seeing therefore it was fit to haue that custome, &amp; the forme of it knowne, and that once for all, the manner being euer the same, it was fittest to relate it on the first occasion, what number soeuer they were that were then buried; which neuerthelesse is not likely to haue been so few as <hi>Dionysius</hi> saith. For the Funerall was not celebrated till the Winter after they were slaine, so that many more were slaine before this solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and may all be accounted amongst the first. And that <hi>Pericles</hi> performed the office of making their Funerall Oration, there is no reason alledged by him, why it should be doubted.</p>
            <p>Another fault hee finds, is this; That he introduceth the <hi>Athenian</hi> Generals in a Dialogue, with the Inhabitants of the Ile of <hi>Melos,</hi> pretending openly, for the cause of their inuasion of that Ile, the power and will of the State of <hi>Athens,</hi> and reiecting vtterly, to enter into any disputation with them, concerning the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of their cause; which he saith, was contrary to the dignity of the State.</p>
            <p>To this may be answered; That the Proceeding of these Generals was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to diuers other Actions, that the people of <hi>Athens</hi> openly tooke vpon them; and therefore it is very likely they were allowed so to proceed. Howsoeuer, if the <hi>Athenian People</hi> gaue in charge to these their Captaines, to take in the Iland, by all meanes whatsoeuer, without power to report backe vnto them first, the equity of the Ilanders cause, as is most likely to be true, I see then no reason the Generals had to enter into disputation with them, whether they should performe their charge, or not, but onely whether they should doe it by faire, or foule meanes; which is the point treated of in this Dialogue. Other Cauils he hath, touching the matter, and order of this History, but not needfull to be answered.</p>
            <p>Then for his phrase, he carpeth at it in infinite places, both for obscure and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious. He that will see the particular places, he reprehendeth, let him read <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi> himselfe, if he will; for the matter is too tedious for this place. It is true, that there be some Sentences in him, somewhat long, not obscure to one that is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue; and besides that, they are but few. Yet is this the most important fault he findeth. For the rest, the obscurity that is, proceedeth from the profoundnesse of the Sentences, containing contemplations of those humane passions, which either dissembled, or not commonly discoursed of, doe yet carry the greatest sway with men, in their publique conuersation. If then one cannot penetrate into them without much meditation, we are not to expect a man should vnderstand them at the first speaking. <hi>Marcellinus</hi> saith, he was obscure on purpose, that the Common people might not vnderstand him. And not vnlikely; for a wise man should so write (thogh in words vnderstood by all men) that wise men only should be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him. But this obscurity is not to be in the Narrations of things done, not in the descriptions of places, or of battels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>, <hi>Thucydides</hi> is most perspicuous,
<pb facs="tcp:18271:10"/>
as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the words before cited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath testified of him. But in the Characters of mens humours and manners, and applying them to affaires of consequence, it is impossible not to be obscure to ordinary capacities, in what words soeuer a man deliuer his mind; If therefore <hi>Thucydides</hi> in his Orations, or in the Description of a Sedition, or other thing of that kind, be not easily vnderstood, it is of those onely that cannot penetrate into the nature of such things, and proceedeth not from any intricacy of expression. <hi>Dionysius</hi> further findeth fault with his vsing to set word against word, which the <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> call <hi>Antitheta.</hi> Which, as it is in some kind of speech, a very great vice, so is it not vnproper in Characters; and of comparatiue discourses, it is almost the onely Stile.</p>
            <p>And whereas he further taxeth him for licentiousnesse in turning <hi>Nownes</hi> into <hi>Verbes,</hi> and <hi>Verbes</hi> into <hi>Nownes,</hi> and altering of <hi>Genders, Cases,</hi> and <hi>Numbers,</hi> as hee doth sometimes for the more efficacy of his Stile, &amp; without <hi>Soloecisme,</hi> I leaue him to the answer of <hi>Marcellinus</hi>; who sayes, <hi>That</hi> Dionysius <hi>findeth fault with this, as being ignorant</hi> (yet he was a professed <hi>Rhetorician) that this was the most excellent, and perfect kind of speaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some man may peraduenture desire to know, what motiue <hi>Dionysius</hi> might haue, to extenuate the worth of him, whom he himselfe acknowledgeth to haue beene esteemed by all men, for the best by farre of all Historians that euer writ, and to haue been taken by all the Antient <hi>Orators</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Philosophers,</hi> for the measure and rule of writing History. What motiue he had to it, I know not; but what glory he might expect by it, is easily knowne. For hauing first preferred <hi>Herodotus,</hi> his Countreyman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a <hi>Halicarnassian,</hi> before <hi>Thucydides,</hi> who was accounted the best, and then conceiuing that his owne History might perhaps be thought not inferiour to that of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> by this computation he saw the honour of the best Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher falling on himselfe; Wherin (in the opinion of all men) he hath misreckoned. And thus much for the obiections of <hi>Denis</hi> of <hi>Halicarnasse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is written of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> the famous Orator, that he wrote ouer the History of <hi>Thucydides</hi> with his owne hand, eight times. So much was this Worke estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, euen for the eloquence. But yet was this his eloquence not at all fit for the barre, but proper for History, and rather to be read, then heard. For words that passe away (as in publike Orations they must) without pause, ought to be vnderstood with ease, and are lost else; though words that remaine in writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Reader to meditate on, ought rather to be pithy, and full. <hi>Cicero</hi> therefore doth iustly set him a part, from the ranke of Pleaders, but withall, he continually giueth him his due for History. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>De Oratore. What great Rhetorician euer borrowed any thing of</hi> Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides? <hi>yet all men praise him, I confesse it, as a wise, seuere, graue Relator of things done. Not for a Pleader of Causes at the Barre, but a Reporter of Warre in History. So that he was neuer reckoned an Orator, nor if he had neuer written a History, had his name therefore not been extant, being a man of Honour and Nobility. Yet, none of them imitate the gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity of his Words and Sentences; but when they haue vttered a kinde of lame and disioynted stuffe, they presently thinke themselues brothers of</hi> Thucydides. Againe, in his Booke, <hi>De optimo Oratore,</hi> he saith thus. <hi>But here will stand vp</hi> Thucydides; <hi>For his eloquence is by some admired; and iustly. But this is nothing to the Orator wee seeke; for it is one thing to vnfold a matter by way of Narration; another thing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse a man, or cleere him by Arguments. And in Narrations, one thing to stay the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; another to stirre him. Lucian,</hi> in his Booke entituled, <hi>How a History ought to be written,</hi> doth continually exemplifie the vertues which he requires in an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographer, by <hi>Thucydides.</hi> And if a man consider well that whole Discourse of his, he shall plainely perceiue, that the Image of this present History, praeconceiued in <hi>Lucians</hi> minde, suggested vnto him all the Precepts he there deliuereth. Lastly, heare the most true and proper commendation of him, from <hi>Iustus Lipsius,</hi> in his Notes to his Booke, <hi>De Doctrina Ciuili,</hi> in these words. Thucydides, <hi>who hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not many, nor very great matters, hath perhaps yet won the Garland from all that haue written of matters, both many and great. Euery where for Eloquution graue; short and thicke with sense; sound in his iudgements; euery where secretly instructing, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a mans life and actions. In his Orations and Excursions, almost Diuine. Whom the oftner you read, the more you shall carry away, yet neuer be dismissed without appetite. Next to him is</hi> Polybius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus much concerning the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Thucydides.</hi>

And for this cause, they were of no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility at all, eyther for greatnesse of Cities, or other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision. But the fattest Soyles were alwaies the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to these changes of Inhabitants; as that which is now called <hi>Thessalia,</hi> and <hi>Boeotia,</hi> and the greatest part of <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnesus,</hi>

For, the goodnesse of the Land increasing the power of some particular men, both caused Seditions, (whereby they were ruin'd at home) and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, made them more obnoxious to the insidiation of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.

            <p>And to me, the imbecillity of ancient times, is not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle demonstrated also by this [that followeth.] For before the <hi>Trojan</hi> Warre, nothing appeareth to haue beene done by <hi>Greece</hi> in Common; nor indeed was it, as I thinke, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all by that one name of <hi>Hellas</hi>; nor before the time of <hi>Hellen,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> was there any such name at all.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> MEN of <hi>Athens,</hi> It is but Iustice, that such as come to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the ayde of their neighbours, (as now doe wee) and cannot pretend by any great benefit or League, some precedent merit, should before they goe any further, make it appeare, principally, that what they seeke conferreth profit, or if not so, yet is not prejudiciall at least, to those that are to grant it: and next, that they will bee constantly thankfull for the same. And if they cannot doe this, then not to take it ill, though their suite bee rejected. And the <hi>Corcyraeans</hi> being fully perswaded that they can make all this appeare on their owne parts, haue therefore sent vs hither, desiring you to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them to the number of your Confederates. Now so it is, that we haue had a Custome, both vnreasonable in respect of our Suite to you, and also for the present vnprofitable to our owne estate. For, hauing euer till now, beene vnwilling to admit others into League with vs, we are now not onely suiters for League to others, but also left destitute by that meanes, of friends in this our Warre with the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> And that which before wee thought wisdome, namely, not to enter with others into League, because wee would not at the discretion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers enter into danger, wee now finde to haue beene our weaknesse, and imprudence. Wherefore, though alone wee repulsed the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in the late Battell by Sea, yet since they are set to inuade vs with greater preparation, out of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> and the rest of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18271:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>Greece;</hi> and seeing with our owne single power we are not able to goe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> through; and since also the danger, in case they subdue vs, would bee very great to all <hi>Greece;</hi> it is both necessary that wee seeke the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, both of you, and of whomsoeuer else wee can; and we are also to be pardoned, though we make bold to crosse our former custome of not hauing to doe with other men, proceeding not from malice, but error of iudgement. Now if you yeeld vnto vs, in what wee request, this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidence (on our part) of need, will on your part bee honourable, for many reasons. First, in this respect, that you lend your helpe to such as haue suffered, and not to such as haue committed the iniustice. And next, considering that you receiue into League, such as haue at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> stake their whole fortune, you shall so place your benefit, as to haue a testimony of it, if euer any can be so indeleble. Besides this, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Nauie but your owne, is ours: Consider then, what rarer hap, and of greater griefe to your enemies, can befall you, then that that power, which you would haue prized aboue any money, or other requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, should come voluntarily, and without all danger or cost, present it selfe to your hands; bringing with it reputation amongst most men; a gratefull minde from those you defend; and strength to your selues. All which haue not happened at once to many. And few there bee of those that sue for League, that come not rather to receiue strength, and reputation, then to conferre it. If any heere thinke, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Warre wherein wee may doe you seruice, will not at all bee, hee is in an errour, and seeth not, how the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> through feare of you, are already in labour of the Warre; and that the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> gracious with them, and enemies to you, making way for their Enterprize, assault vs now, in the way to the invasion of you heereafter, that wee may not stand amongst the rest of their common Enemies, but that they may be sure before-hand, either to weaken vs, or to strengthen their owne estate. It must therefore be your part, we offering, and you accepting the League, to beginne with them, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> anticipate plotting, rather then to counterplot against them. If they object injustice, in that you receiue their Colonie, henceforth let them learne, that all Colonies, so long as they receiue no wrong from their Mother Citie, so long they honour her; but when they suffer injurie from her, they then become alienate: for they are not sent out to be the Slaues of them that stay, but to be their equals. That they haue done vs the injurie, is manifest; for when wee offered them a judiciall tryall of the Controversie, touching <hi>Epidamnus,</hi> they chose to prosecute their quarrell, rather by Armes then Iudgement. Now let that which they haue done vnto vs, who are their kindred, serue you for some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not to bee seduced by their demands, and made their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

For hee liues most secure, that hath fewest benefits bestowed by him vpon his Enemies, to repent of. As for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles betweene you and the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> they are not broken by receiuing vs into your League, because wee are in League with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partie. For there, it is said, That whosoeuer is Confederate of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, may haue accesse lawfully to either. And sure it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnreasonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> should haue the libertie to man their Fleet out of the Cities co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prised in the League, and out of any other parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> and not the least out of <note n="*" place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if they impute it to you as a fault, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> you grant our request; wee shall take it for a greater, that you grant it not. For therein you shall reject vs, that are invaded, and bee none of your Enemies; and them, who are your Enemies, and make the invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you shall not onely not oppose, but also suffer to raise vnlawfull Forces in your Dominions; Whereas you ought in truth, either not to suffer them to take vp Mercenaries in your States, or else to send vs succours also; in such manner as you shall thinke good your selues; but especially by taking vs into your League, and so aiding vs. Many commodities, as wee said in the beginning, wee shew vnto you, but this for the greatest, that whereas they are your Enemies, (which is manifest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> enough) and not weake ones, but able to hurt those that stand vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, wee offer you a Nauall, not a Terrestriall League; and the want of one of these, is not as the want of the other: Nay rather, your principall aime, if it could be done, should bee, to let none at all haue shipping but your selues; or at least, if that cannot bee, to make such your friends, as are best furnished therewith. If any man now thinke thus, that what we haue spoken, is indeed profitable, but feares if it were admitted, the League were thereby broken: let that man consider, that his feare ioyned with strength, will make his Enemies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> feare, and his confidence, hauing (if hee reject vs) so much the lesse strength, will so much the lesse be feared. Let him also remember, that hee is now in consultation, no lesse concerning <hi>Athens,</hi> then <hi>Corcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi> wherein hee forecasteth none of the best, (considering the present estate of affaires) that makes a question, whether against a Warre at hand, and onely not already on foot, hee should ioyne vnto it, or not, that Citty which with most important advantages, or disadvantages, will be friend or enemie. For it lyeth so conveniently for sayling into <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> that it can both prohibit any Fleet to come to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponnesus</hi> from thence, and convoy any comming from <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesus</hi>

or not, by this. For <hi>Greece</hi> hauing but three Nauies of any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> account, yours, ours, and that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> if you suffer the other two to ioyne in one, by letting the <hi>Corinthians</hi> first seaze vs, you shall haue to fight by Sea at one time, both against the <hi>Corcyraeans</hi> and the <hi>Peloponnesians;</hi> whereas by making League with vs, you shall with your Fleet augmented, haue to deale against the <hi>Peloponnesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> alone.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>Corcyraeans</hi> in their Oration hauing made mention not onely of your taking them into League, but also, that they are wronged, and vniustly warred on; it is also necessarie for vs first to answer concerning both those points, and then afterwards to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the rest of what we haue to say, to the end you may fore-know, that ours are the safest demands for you to embrace, and that you may vpon reason reject the needy estate of those others. Whereas they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge in defence of their refusing to enter League with other Cities, that the same hath proceeded from modesty, the truth is, that they tooke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vp that Custome, not from any vertue, but meere wickednesse; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnwilling to call any Confederate for a witnesse of their euill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to bee put to blush by calling them. Besides, their Citty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the scituation sufficient within it selfe, giueth them this point, that when they doe any man a wrong, they themselues are the Iudges of the same, and not men appointed by consent. For going seldome forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst other Nations, they intercept such, as by necessity are driven into their Harbour. And in this consisteth their goodly pretext, for not admitting Confederates, not because they would not bee content to accompany others in doing euill, but because they had rather doe it alone; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that where they were too strong, they might oppresse; and when there should bee none to obserue them, the lesse of the profit might be shared from them, and that they might escape the shame when they tooke any thing. But if they had beene honest men, (as they themselues say they are) by how much the lesse they are obnoxious to accusation, so much the more meanes they haue, by giuing, and taking what is due to make their honesty appeare. But they are not such, neither towards others, nor towards vs. For being our Colony, they haue not onely beene euer in reuolt, but now they also make warre vpon vs, and say they were not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> sent out to be injured by vs; but we say againe, that wee did not send
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18271:29"/>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> them forth to bee scorned by them, but to haue the leading of them, and to bee regarded by them, as is fit. For our other Colonies both honour and loue vs much, which is an argument, seeing the rest are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with our actions, that these haue no iust cause to bee offended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; and that without some manifest wrong, wee should not haue had colour to warre against them. But say wee had beene in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, it had beene well done in them, to haue giuen way to our passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it had beene also dishonourable in vs, to haue insulted ouer their modesty. But through pride and wealth, they haue done vs wrong, both in many other things, and also in this, that <hi>Epidam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> being ours, which whilest it was vexed with Warres, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer claimed, assoone as wee came to relieue it, was forcibly seazed by them, and so holden. They say now, that before they tooke it, they offered to put the cause to tryall of Iudgement: But you are not to thinke, that such a one will stand to Iudgement, as hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and is sure already of what hee offereth to pleade for; but rather hee that before the tryall, will admit equality in the matter it selfe, as well as in the pleading: whereas contrarily these men, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not this specious pretence of a Iudiciall tryall, before they had besieged the Citty, but after, when they saw wee meant not to put it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vp. And now hither they bee come, not content to haue beene faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that businesse themselues, but to get in you, into their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy? no; but into their conspiracy; and to receiue them in this name, that they are enemies to vs. But they should haue come to you then, when they were most in safety; not now, when we haue the wrong, and they the danger; and when you, that never partaked of their power, must impart vnto them of your ayde; and hauing beene free from their faults, must haue an equall share from vs of the blame. They should communicate their power before-hand, that meane to make common the issue of the same; and they that share not in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> crimes, ought also to haue no part in the sequele of them. Thus it appeares that wee come for our parts, with arguments of equity and right; whereas the proceedings of these other, are nothing else but violence and rapine. And now we shall shew you likewise, that you cannot receiue them in point of Iustice. For although it bee in the Articles, that the Cities written with neyther of the parties, may come in, to whether of them they please; yet it holds not for such as doe so, to the detriment of eyther; but onely for those that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reuolted from neither part, want protection, and bring not a Warre with them in stead of peace to those (if they bee wise) that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them. For you shall not onely be Auxiliaries vnto these; but to vs, in stead of Confederates, Enemies. For if you goe with them,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18271:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it followes, they must defend themselues, not without you. You should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> doe most vprightly, to stand out of both our wayes; and if not that, then to take our parts against the <hi>Corcyraeans,</hi> (for betweene the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and you, there are Articles of peace, but with the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyraeans</hi> you neuer had so much as a Truce) and not to constitute a new Law of receiving one anothers Rebels. For neither did we giue our votes against you, when the <hi>Samians</hi> revolted, though the rest of <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> was diuided in opinion: But plainely alledged, That it was reason, that euery one should haue liberty to proceed against their owne revolting Confederates. And if you shall once receiue and ayde the doers of wrong, it will bee seene, that they will come ouer as fast from you to vs; and you shall set vp a Law, not so much against vs,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as against your selues. These are the points of Iustice wee had to shew you, conformable to the Law of the <hi>Grecians.</hi> And now wee come to matter of aduice, and claime of fauour; which (being not so much your enemies as to hurt you, nor such friends as to surcharge you) wee say, ought in the present occasion, to bee granted vs by way of requitall: For when you had want of Long Barques against the <hi>Aeginetae,</hi> a little before the <hi>Medan</hi> War, you had <hi>20.</hi> lent vnto you by the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> which benefit of ours, and that other against the <hi>Samians,</hi> when by vs it was, that the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> did not ayd them, was the cause both of your victory against the <hi>Aeginetae,</hi> and of the punishment of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the <hi>Samians.</hi> And these things were done for you in a season, when men, going to fight against their enemies, neglect all respects, but of victory. For euen a mans Domesticke affaires are ordered the worse, through eagernesse of present contention.

                        <head>THE ORATION OF THE Ambassadours of CORINTH.</head>
                        <p>MEn of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> your own fidelity, both in matter of estate &amp; conuersation, maketh you the lesse apt to beleeue vs, when we accuse others of the contrary. And heereby you gaine indeed a reputation of equity, but you haue lesse experience in the affaires of Forraine States. For although we haue oftentimes foretold you, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> would doe vs a mischiefe; yet from time to time when we told it you, you neuer would take informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it; but haue suspected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> rather, that what we spake, hath proceeded from our owne priuate differences. And you haue therefore called hither these Confederates, not before wee had suffered, but now, when the euill is already vpon vs. Before whom, our speech must bee so much the longer, by how much our obiections are the greater, in that wee haue both by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> beene iniured, and by you neglected. If the <hi>Athenians</hi> lurking in some obscure place, had done these wrongs vnto the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> wee should then haue needed to proue the same before you, as to men that knew it not. But now what cause haue wee to vse long discourse, when you see already that some are brought into seruitude, and that they are contriuing the like against others, and especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> our Confederates, and are themselues, in case Warre should be made against them, long since prepared for it? For else they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue taken <hi>Corcyra,</hi> and holden it from vs by force, nor haue besieged <hi>Potidaea,</hi> whereof the one was most commodious for any action against <hi>Thrace;</hi> and the other had brought vnto the <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnesians</hi> a most faire Nauie. And of all this, you are your selues the authors, in that you suffered them, vpon the end of the <hi>Persian</hi> Warre, to fortifie their Citie, and againe afterwards to raise their Long Walles, whereby you haue hitherto depriued of their liberty, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> onely the States by them already subdued, but also your owne Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. For not he that bringeth into slauery, but he that being able to hinder it, neglects the same, is most truely said to doe it; especially if they assume the honour to be the esteemed <hi>Deliuerers of Greece,</hi> [as you doe.] And for all that, we are hardly yet come together, and indeed not yet, with any certaine resolution what to doe. For the question should not haue beene put, Whether, or not, wee haue receiued iniurie, but rather, in what manner we are to repaire it. For they that doe the wrong, hauing consulted vpon it before-hand, vse no delay at all, but come vpon them whom they meane to oppresse, whilest they be yet irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And we know, not onely that the <hi>Athenians</hi> haue incroached
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18271:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vpon their neighbours, but also by what wayes they haue done it. And as long as they thinke they carry it closely, through your blindnesse, they are the lesse bold. But when they shall perceiue that you see, and will not see, they will then presse vs strongly indeed. For <hi>(Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians)</hi> you are the onely men of all <hi>Greece,</hi> that sitting still, defend others, not with your Forces, but with promises; and you are also the onely men, that loue to pull downe the power of the Enemie, not when it beginneth, but when it is doubled. You haue indeede a report to bee sure; but yet it is more in fame that, then in fact. For we our selues know, that the <hi>Persian</hi> came against <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vtmost parts of the Earth, before you encountred him, as became your State. And also now you conniue at the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who are not as the <hi>Medes,</hi> farre off, but hard at band; choosing rather to defend your selues from their inuasion, then to inuade them; and by hauing to doe with them when their strength is greater, to put your selues vpon the chance of Fortune. And yet wee know, that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> own errour, and (in our Warre against the <hi>Athenians</hi>) their owne ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights, more then your assistance, was the thing that gaue vs victory. For the hope of your ayde, hath beene the destruction of some, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on you, made no preparation for themselues by other meanes. Yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> let not any man thinke that we speak this out of malice, but only by way of expostulation: for <hi>expostulation</hi> is with friends that erre, but <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,</hi> against enemies that haue done an iniurie. Besides, if there bee any that may challenge to exprobrate his neighbour, we thinke our selues may best doe it, especially on so great quarrels as these, whereof you neither seeme to haue any feeling, nor to consider what manner of men, and how different from you in euery kinde the <hi>Athenians</hi> bee, that you are to contend withall: For <hi>they</hi> loue innovation, and are swift to devise, and also to execute what they resolue on. But <hi>you</hi> on the contrary are onely apt to saue your owne; not devise any thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> new, nor scarce to attaine what is necessary. <hi>They</hi> againe are bold beyond their strength, adventurous aboue their owne reason, and in danger hope still the best: Whereas <hi>your</hi> actions are euer beneath your power, and <hi>you</hi> distrust euen what your iudgement assures; and being in a danger, neuer thinke to bee deliuered. <hi>They</hi> are stirrers, <hi>you</hi> studiers: <hi>they</hi> loue to bee abroad, and <hi>you</hi> at home the most of any. For <hi>they</hi> make account by beeing abroad to adde to their estate; <hi>you,</hi> if you should goe forth against the State of another, would thinke to impayre your owne. <hi>They,</hi> when they ouercome their enemies, aduance the farthest, and when they are ouercome by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their enemies, fall off the least; and as for their Bodies, they vse them in the seruice of the Common-wealth, as if they were none of their owne;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18271:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but their minds, when they would serue the State, are right their owne.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Vnlesse they take in hand what they haue once aduised on, they account so much lost of their owne. And when they take it in hand, if they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any thing, they thinke lightly of it, in respect of what they looke to winne by their prosecution. If they faile in any attempt, they doe what is necessary for the present, and enter presently into other hopes. For they alone, both haue and hope for at once, whatsoeuer they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, through their celerity in execution of what they once resolue on. And in this manner they labour and toyle, all the dayes of their liues. What they haue, they haue no leasure to enioy, for continuall getting of more. Nor Holiday esteeme they any, but whereon they effect some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> matter profitable; nor thinke they ease with nothing to doe, a lesse tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than laborious businesse. So that, in a word, to say they are men, borne neither to rest themselues, nor suffer others, is to say the truth. Now notwithstanding, (men of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi>) that this Citie, your Aduersary, bee such, as wee haue said; yet you still delay time; not knowing, that those onely are they, to whom it may suffice for the most part of their time to sit still, who (though they vse not their power to doe iniustice) yet bewray a minde vnlikely to swallow injuries; but placing equity belike in this, that you neither doe any harme to others, nor receiue it, in defending of your selues. But this is a thing, you hardly could attaine, though the States about you were of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the same condition. But (as we haue before declared) your Customes are in respect of theirs antiquated, and of necessity (as it happeneth in Artes) the new ones will preuaile. True it is, that for a City liuing for the most part in peace, vnchanged customes are the best; but for such as bee constrained to vndergoe many matters, many deuices will be needfull. Which is also the reason, why the <hi>Athenian</hi> Customes, through much experience, are more new to you, then yours are to them. Here therefore giue a Period to your slacknesse, and by a speedy inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Attica,</hi> as you promised, relieue both <hi>Potidaea,</hi> and the rest:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> lest otherwise you betray your friends and kindred to their cruellest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and lest wee and others, be driuen through despaire, to seeke out some other League. Which to doe, were no iniustice, neither against the Gods, Iudges of mens Oathes, nor against Men, the hearers of them. For not they breake the League, who being abandoned, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to others; but they that yeeld not their assistance, to whom they haue sworne it. But if you meane to follow the businesse seriously, wee will stay; for else, wee should doe irreligiously, neither should wee finde any other, more conformable to our manners, then your selues. Therefore deliberate well of these points, and take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> such a course, that <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> may not by your leading,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18271:37"/>

                        <p>THough our Ambassage was not to this end, that wee should ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue against our Confederates, but about such other Affaires as the Citie was pleased to employ vs in; yet hauing heard of the great exclamation against vs, wee came into the Court, not to make answer to the criminations of the Cities (for to pleade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you here, were not to pleade before the Iudges either of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or vs) but to the end you may not be drawne away, to take the worst resolution, at the perswasion of the Confederates, in matters of so great importance. And withall, touching the summe of the Oration made against vs, to informe you, that what wee possesse, wee haue it iustly, and that our Citie deserueth reputation. But what neede wee now to speake of matters long past, confirmed more by heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say; then by the eyes of those that are to heare vs relate them? But our actions against the <hi>Persian,</hi> and such as you your selues know as well as wee, those, though it bee tedious to heare them euer objected, wee must of necessity recite. For when wee did them, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hazarded our selues for some benefit, of which, you as had your parts in the substance, so must wee haue ours (if that be any benefit) in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18271:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
commemoration. And wee shall make recitall of them, not by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but of protestation, and declaration of what a Citty (in case you take ill advice) you haue to enter the list withall. Wee therefore say, that wee not onely first and alone, hazarded Battell against the <hi>Barbarian</hi> in the Fields of <hi>Marathon,</hi> but also afterwards, when hee came againe, beeing vnable to resist him by Land, embarqued our selues, euery man that was able to beare Armes, and gaue him Battell amongst the rest, by Sea, at <hi>Salamis;</hi> which was the cause that kept him backe from sailing to <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> and laying it waste Cittie after Cittie: for against so many Gallies, you were not able to giue each other mutuall succour. And the greatest proofe of this is the <hi>Persian</hi> himselfe, who when his Fleet was ouercome, and that hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had no more such Forces, went away in haste, with the greatest part of his Armie. Which being so, and euident, that the whole State of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> was embarqued in their Fleet, we conferred to the same, the three things of most aduantage; namely, the greatest number of Gallies, the most prudent Commander, and the most liuely courage. (For of <hi>400.</hi> Gallies in the whole, our owne were few lesse then two thirds) and for Commander, <hi>Themistocles,</hi> who was the principall cause that the Battell was fought in the <note n="*" place="margin">Of <hi>Salamis.</hi>
                           </note> streight, whereby he cleerely saued the whole businesse, and whom, though a Stranger, you your selues haue honoured for it, more then any man that came vnto you; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and a forwardnesse wee shewed, more adventurous then any other, in this, that when none of them had ayded vs by Land before, and the rest of the Cities, as farre as to our owne, were brought into servitude, wee were neuerthelesse content, both to quit our Citie, and lose our goods, and euen in that estate, not to betray the Common Cause of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, or diuided from them, to bee vnvsefull; but to put our selues into our Nauie, and vndergoe the danger with them, and that without passion against you, for not hauing formerly defended vs in the like manner. So that we may say, that wee haue no lesse conferred a benefit vpon you, then wee receiued it from you. You came indeed to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ayde vs, but it was from Cities inhabited, and to the end you might still keepe them so; and when you were afraid, not of our danger, but your owne: whereas wee, comming from a Citty no more in <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Athenians,</hi> at the comming in of the <hi>Persian,</hi> when they put themselues into their Gallies, left their Citie to the Army of the <hi>Persians</hi> by Land, and sent their Wiues and children into <hi>Aegina, mis,</hi> and <hi>Traezena.</hi>
                           </note> being, and putting our selues into danger, for a Citty, hopelesse euer to bee againe; saued both you (in part) and our selues. But if wee had ioyned with the <hi>Persian,</hi> fearing (as others did) to haue our Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories wasted; or afterwards, as men lost, durst not haue put our selues into our Gallies, you must not haue fought with him by Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause your Fleet had beene too small; but his affaires had succeeded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as hee would himselfe. Therefore (men of <hi>Lacedaemon)</hi> we deserue
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18271:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not so great envie of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> for our courage at that time, and for our prudence, and for the dominion wee hold, as wee now vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe. Which dominion wee obtained not by violence, but because the Confederates, when your selues would not stay out the reliques of the Warre against the <hi>Barbarian,</hi> came in, and intreated vs to take the command, of their owne accord. So that at first wee were forced to aduance our Dominion to what it is, out of the nature of the thing it selfe; as chiefly for feare, next for honour, and lastly for profit. For when wee had the enuie of many, and had reconquered some that had already revolted, and seeing you were no more our friends, as you had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> beene, but suspected and quarelled vs, wee held it no longer a safe course, laying by our power, to put our selues into your danger. For the reuolts from vs, would all haue beene made to you. Now it is no fault for men in danger, to order their affaires to the best. For you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (men of <hi>Lacedaemon)</hi> haue command ouer the Cities of <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnesus,</hi> and order them to your best advantage: and had you, <note n="*" place="margin">That is, when <hi>Pausanias,</hi> King of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing the Reliques of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Warre, through his pride and insolent Command, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the hatred of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates so farre, as the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> State calling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So that, though ouercome by three the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> greatest things, <hi>honour, feare,</hi> and <hi>profit,</hi> wee haue both accepted the dominion deliuered vs, and refuse againe to surrender it, wee haue therein done nothing to be wondered at, nor beside the manner of men. Nor haue wee beene the first in this kinde, but it hath beene euer a thing fixed, for the weaker to be kept vnder by the stronger. Besides; we tooke the gouernment vpon vs, as esteeming our selues worthy of the same; and of you also so esteemed, till hauing computed the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, you now fall to allegation of equity; a thing which no man that had the occasion to atchieue anything by strength, euer so farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, as to diuert him from his profit. Those men are worthy of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> commendation, who following the naturall inclination of man, in desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rule ouer others, are iuster, then for their power they need. And therefore if another had our power, we thinke it would best make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare our owne moderation; and yet our moderation hath vndeserued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incurred contempt, rather then commendation. For though in pleas of Couenants with our Confederates, when in our owne Citty we haue allowed them triall, by Laws equall both to them and vs, the Iudgement hath beene giuen against vs, we haue then neuerthelesse beene reputed contentious. None of them considering that others, who in other places haue dominion, and are toward their subiect States lesse moderate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then wee, yet are neuer vpbrayded for it. For they that haue the power to compell, need not at all to goe to Law. And yet these men hauing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18271:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beene vsed to converse with vs vpon equall termes, if they lose any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thing which they thinke they should not, eyther by sentence, or by the power of our gouernment, they are not thankfull for the much they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, but take in worse part the little they forgoe, then if at first, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law aside, wee had openly taken their goods by violence. For in that kinde also, they themselues cannot deny, but the weaker must giue way to the stronger. And men, it seemes, are more passionate for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice, then for violence. For that, comming as from an equall, seemeth rapine; and the other, because from one stronger, but necessity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they suffered worse things vnder the <hi>Medes</hi> dominion, they bore it, but thinke ours to bee rigorous. And good reason; for to men in subiection, the present is euer the worst estate. Insomuch as you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> also, if you should put vs downe, and reigne your selues, you would soone finde a change of the loue, which they beare you now for feare of vs, if you should doe againe, as you <note n="*" place="margin">Meaning the Jmperious and tyranicall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>MEN of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> both I my selfe haue the experience of many Warres, and I see you of the same age with mee, to haue the like; insomuch as you cannot desire this Warre, either through inexperience (as many doe) nor yet as apprehending it to bee profitable or safe. And whosoeuer shall temperately consider the Warre wee now deliberate of, will finde it to bee no small one. For though in respect of the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> and our neighbour States, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wee haue equall strength, and can quickly bee vpon them; yet against men, whose Territory is remote, and are also expert Seamen, and with all other things excellently furnished, as money, both priuate and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, Shipping, Horses, Armes, and number, more then any one part of <hi>Greece</hi> besides; and that haue many Confederates, paying them Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute; against such, I say, why should we lightly vndertake the Warre? And since wee are vnfurnished, whereon relying, should we make such haste to it? On our Nauie? But therein we are too weake. And if we will prouide and prepare against them, it will require time. On our money? But therein also we are more too weake; for neither hath the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> State any, nor will priuate men readily contribute. But it may be, some rely on this, that wee exceed them in Armes, and multitude of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, so that we may waste their Territories with incursions. But there is much other Land vnder their dominion, and by Sea they are able to bring in whatsoeuer they shall stand in need of. Againe, if wee assay to alienate their Confederates, wee must ayde them with Shipping, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the most of them are Ilanders. What a Warre then will this of ours bee? For vnlesse we haue the better of them in Shipping, or take from them their reuenue, whereby their Nauy is maintained, we shall doe the most hurt to our selues. And in this case to let fall the Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> will be no honour for vs, when we are chiefly thought to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun it. As for the hope, that if we waste their Countrey, the Warre will soone be at an end; let that neuer lift vs vp: for I feare we shall transmit it rather to our children. For it is likely the <hi>Athenians</hi> haue the spirit not to be slaues to their earth, nor as men without experience, to be astonished at the Warre. And yet I doe not aduise that wee should stupidly suffer our Confederates to bee wronged, and not apprehend the <hi>Athenians</hi> in their plots against them; but onely, not yet to take vp Armes, but to send and expostulate with them, making no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> great shew neither of war, nor of sufferance: and in this meane time to make our provisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and make friends, both of <hi>Greeks</hi> &amp; <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:18271:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such as in any place wee can get, of power either in shipping or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> money (nor are they to be blamed, that being laid in wait for, as wee are by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> take vnto them, not <hi>Grecians</hi> only, but also <hi>Barbarians</hi> for their safety) and withall to set forth our owne. If they listen to our Ambassadours, best of all; if not, then two or three yeeres passing ouer our heads, being better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, wee may warre vpon them, if we will. And when they see our preparation, and heare words that import no lesse, they will perhaps relent the sooner; especially, hauing their grounds vnhurt, and consulting vpon commodities extant, and not yet spoiled. For wee must thinke their Territorie to bee nothing but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> an Hostage, and so much the more, by how much the better husbanded. The which wee ought therefore to spare as long as wee may, lest making them desperate, we make them also the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to expugne. For if vnfurnished as wee bee, at the instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Confederates, we waste their Territory, consider if in so doing, we doe not make the Warre both more dishonourable to the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> and also more difficult. For though accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, as well against Cities, as priuate men, may bee cleered againe, a warre for the pleasure of some, taken vp by all, the successe whereof cannot bee foreseene, can hardly with honour be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> letten fall againe. Now let no man thinke it cowardise, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Cities, we goe not presently, and invade that one City; for of Confederates that bring them in money, they haue more then wee; and Warre is not so much Warre of Armes, as Warre of Money, by meanes whereof Armes are vsefull; especially when it is a Warre of Land-men, against Sea-men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs first prouide our selues of money, and not first raise the Warre, vpon the perswasion of the Confederates. For wee that must be thought the causes of all euents, good or bad, haue also reason to take some leasure, in part to foresee them. As for the slacknesse and procrastination, wherewith wee are reproached by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Confederates, bee neuer ashamed of it; for the more haste you make to the Warre, you will bee the longer before you end it, for that you goe to it vnprouided. Besides, our Citie hath beene euer free, and well thought of. And this which they obiect, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be called a Modesty proceeding vpon iudgement. For by that it is, that we alone, are neither arrogant vpon good successe, nor shrinke so much as others in aduersity. Nor are wee, when men prouoke vs to it with praise, through the delight thereof, moued to vndergoe danger, more then wee thinke fit our selues; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> nor when they sharpen vs with reprehension, doth the smart
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18271:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thereof a iot the more preuaile vpon vs. And this modesty of ours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maketh vs both good Souldiers, and good Counsellours: good Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, because shame begetteth modesty, and valour is most sensible of shame; good Counsellours, in this, that wee are brought vp more simply, then to disesteeme the Lawes, and by seuerity, more modestly then to disobey them. And also in that, that wee doe not, like men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wise in things needlesse, finde fault brauely with the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Enemie, and in effect not assault him accordingly; but doe thinke our neighbours cogitations like our owne, and that the euents of Fortune cannot be discerned by a speech; and doe therefore alwayes so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> furnish our selues really against the enemy, as against men well adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. For we are not to build our hopes vpon the ouersights of them, but vpon the safe foresight of our selues. Nor must wee thinke that there is much difference betweene man and man, but him onely to bee the best, that hath beene brought vp amongst the most difficulties. Let vs not therefore cast aside the institutions of our Ancestours, which wee haue so long retained to our profit; nor let vs, of many mens liues, of much money, of many Cities, and much honour, hastily resolue in so small a part of one day, but at leasure; the which wee haue better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity then any other to doe, by reason of our power. Send to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> about the matter of <hi>Potidaea,</hi> send about that wherein the Confederates say they are iniured; and the rather, because they bee content to referre the cause to Iudgement: And one that offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to Iudgement, may not lawfully be invaded, as a doer of iniurie, before the iudgement be giuen; and prepare withall for the Warre; so shall you take the most profitable counsell for your selues, and the most formidable to the Enemy.</p>

               </note> And <hi>Themistocles</hi> sendeth priuily to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> about the same men, to take order for their stay, with as little apparence of it as they could, and not to dismisse them, till their owne Ambassadours were retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

For that in strength vnequall, men cannot alike and equally aduise for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit of</hi> Greece. <hi>Therefore</hi> (said hee) <hi>eyther must all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Confederate Cities bee vnwalled, or you must not thinke amisse of what is done by vs.</hi> The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> when they heard him,<note place="margin">The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their dislike.</note> though they made no shew of being angry with the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> (for they had not sent their Ambassadours to forbid them, but by way of aduice, to admonish them not to build the Wall; besides they bare them affection then, for their courage shewne against the <hi>Medes</hi>) yet they were inwardly offended, because they missed of their will. And the Ambassadours returned home of either side, without complaint.<note place="margin">The Walles of <hi>Athens</hi> built in haste.</note> Thus the <hi>Athenians</hi> quickly raised <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their Walles, the structure it selfe making manifest the haste vsed in the building.

               </note> and withall presently helped them in the obtaining it. By his counsell also it was, that they built the Wall of that breadth about <hi>Piraeus,</hi> which is now to be seene.

And yet within <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it, there was neither Rubbish nor Morter, [to fill it vp,] but it was made all of great stones, cut square, and bound

together with Iron and Lead. But for height, it was raised <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but to the halfe at the most of what he had intended. For hee would haue had it able to hold out the Enemie, both by the height and breadth; and that a few, and the lesse seruiceable men might haue sufficed to defend it, and the rest haue serued in the Nauie.

Whereas our owne power is lesse obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to such accidents, consisting more in the persons of men then in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. And if wee ouercome them but in one Battell by Sea, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability they are totally vanquished. And if they hold out, wee also shall with longer time apply our selues to Nauall affaires. And when wee shall once haue made our skill equall to theirs, we shall surely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermatch them in courage. For the valour that wee haue by nature, they shall neuer come vnto by teaching; but the experience which they exceed vs in, that must wee attaine vnto by industry. And the money wherewith to bring this to passe, it must be all our parts to contribute. For else it were a hard case, that the Confederates of the <hi>Athenians</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> should not sticke to contribute to their owne seruitude; and wee should refuse to lay out our money, to bee reuenged of our enemies, and for our owne preseruation, and that the <hi>Athenians</hi> take not our money from vs, and euen with that doe vs mischiefe. Wee haue also many other wayes of Warre; as the reuolt of their Confederates, which is the principall meanes of lessening their reuenue; <note n="*" place="margin">Though this be here said in the person of a <hi>Corinthian,</hi> yet it was neuer thought on by any of that side, till <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> put it into their heads, when he reuolted from his Countrey.</note> the building of Forts in their Territorie, and many other things which one cannot now foresee. For the course of Warre is guided by nothing lesse then by the points of our account, but of it selfe contriueth most things vpon the occasion. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> VVherein, he that complies with it, with most temper, standeth the firmest; and hee that is most passionate, oftenest miscarries. Imagine wee had differences each of vs about the limits of our Territorie, with an equall Aduersary; wee must vndergoe them. But now the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> are a match for vs all at once, and one Citie after another, too strong for vs. Insomuch that vnlesse wee oppose them ioyntly, and euery Nation and City set to it vnanimously, they will ouercome vs asunder, without labour. And know, that to be vanquished (though it trouble you to heare it) brings with it no less then manifest serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: which, but to mention as a doubt, as if so many Cities could suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vnder one, were very dishonourable to <hi>Peloponnesus.</hi> For it must then bee thought, that wee are either punished vpon merit, or else
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18271:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that wee endure it out of feare, and so appeare degenerate from our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Ancestours; for by them the liberty of all <hi>Greece</hi> hath beene resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; whereas wee for our parts, assure not so much as our owne; but claiming the reputation of hauing deposed Tyrants in the seuerall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, suffer a Tyrant Citie to be established amongst vs. Wherein we know not how we can auoyd one of these three great faults, <hi>Foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Cowardise,</hi> or <hi>Negligence.</hi> For certainely, you auoyde them not, by imputing it to that which hath done most men hurt, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Enemie:</hi> for <hi>Contempt,</hi> because it hath made too many men miscarry, hath gotten the name of <hi>Foolishnesse.</hi> But to what end should wee obiect matters past, more then is necessary to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> busines in hand? wee must now by helping the <hi>present,</hi> labour for the <hi>future.</hi> For it is peculiar to our Countrey to attaine honour by labour; and though you be now somewhat aduanced in honour and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, you must not therefore change the custome; for there is no reason that what was gotten in want, should be lost by wealth. But wee should confidently goe in hand with the Warre, as for many other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so also for this, that both the God hath by his Oracle aduised vs thereto, and promised to bee with vs himselfe: and also for that the rest of <hi>Greece</hi> some for feare, and some for profit, are ready to take our parts. Nor are you they that first breake the Peace, (which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                           <hi>the God,</hi> in as much as hee doth encourage vs to the Warre, iudgeth violated by them) but you fight rather in defence of the same. For not hee breaketh the Peace, that taketh reuenge, but hee that is the first invader· So that, Seeing it will be euery way good to make the Warre, and since in common wee perswade the same; and seeing also that both to the Cities, and to priuate men, it will bee the most profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble course, put off no longer, neither the defence of the <hi>Potidaeans,</hi> who are <hi>Doreans,</hi> and besieged (which was wont to bee contrary) by <hi>Iönians,</hi> nor the recouery of the liberty of the rest of the <hi>Grecians.</hi> For it is a case that admitteth not delay, when they are some of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> already oppressed: and others (after it shall be knowne wee met, and durst not right our selues) shall shortly after vndergoe the like. But thinke <hi>(Confederates)</hi> you are now at a necessity, and that this is the best advice. And therefore giue your Votes for the Warre, not fearing the present danger, but coueting the long Peace proceeding from it. (For though by warre groweth the confirmation of Peace, yet for loue of ease to refuse the warre, doth not likewise auoyde the danger. But making account, that a Tyrant Citie set vp in <hi>Greece,</hi> is set vp alike ouer all, and reigneth ouer some already, and the rest in intention, we shall bring it againe into order by the warre; and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> onely liue for the time to come out of danger our selues, but also deliuer

                        <p>MEN of <hi>Athens,</hi> I am still not onely of the same opinion, not to giue way to the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> (notwithstanding, I know that men haue not the same passions in the Warre it selfe, which they haue when they are incited to it, but change their opinions with the events) but also I see, that I must now aduise the same things, or very neere to what I haue before deliuered. And I require of you, with whom my counsell shall take place, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> if wee miscarry in ought, you will eyther make the best of it, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by Common Consent, or if wee prosper, not to attribute it to your owne wisdome onely. For it falleth out with the euents of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, no lesse then with the purposes of man, to proceed with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainety: which is also the cause, that when any thing happeneth contrary to our expectation, wee vse to lay the fault on Fortune. That the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> both formerly, and especially now, take counsell how to doe vs mischiefe, is a thing manifest. For whereas it is said, [in the Articles] that in our mutuall controuersies, we shall giue and receiue trials of Iudgement, and in the meane time, eyther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> side hold what they possesse, they neuer yet sought any such try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all themselues, nor will accept of the same offered by vs. They will

cleere themselues of their accusations, by Warre rather then by words:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and come hither no more now to expostulate, but to command. For they command vs to arise from before <hi>Potidaea,</hi> and to restore the <hi>Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netae</hi> to the liberty of their owne Lawes, and to abrogate the Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Megareans.</hi> And they that come last, command vs to restore all the <hi>Grecians</hi> to their liberty. Now let none of you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that wee shall goe to Warre for a trifle, by not abrogating the Act concerning <hi>Megara,</hi> (yet this by them is pretended most, and that for the abrogation of it, the Warre shall stay;) nor retaine a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in your mindes, as if a small matter moued you to the Warre: for euen this small matter containeth the tryall and constancy of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Wherein if you giue them way, you shall hereafter bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a greater matter, as men that for feare will obey them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in that. But by a stiffe-deniall, you shall teach them plainely, to come to you heereafter on termes of more equality. Resolue therefore from this occasion, eyther to yeeld them obedience, before you receiue damage; or if wee must haue Warre, (which for my part I thinke is best,) be the pretence weighty or light, not to giue way, nor keepe what wee possesse, in feare. For a great and a little claime, imposed by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals vpon their neighbours, before Iudgement, by way of command, hath one and the same vertue to make subiect. As for the Warre,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> how both wee and they be furnished, and why wee are not like to haue the worse, by hearing the particulars, you shall now vnderstand.

For some will desire most to take reuenge on some enemie, and others to haue their estates least wasted; and being long before they can assemble, they take the lesser part of their time to debate the Common businesse, and the greater, to dispatch their owne priuate affaires. And euery one supposeth that his owne neglect of the Common estate, can doe little hurt, and that it will bee the care of some body else to looke to that, for his owne good: Not obseruing how by these thoughts of euery one in seuerall, the Common businesse is ioyntly ruined. But their greatest hindrance of all, will be their want of money, which being raised slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their actions must bee full of delay, which the occasions of warre will not endure. As for their fortifying here, and their Nauie, they are matters not worthy feare. For it were a hard matter for a Citie equall to our owne, in time of peace to fortifie in that manner, much lesse in the Countrey of an Enemie, and wee no lesse fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. And if they had a Garrison here, though they might by excursions, and by the receiuing of our Fugitiues, annoy some part of our Territory; yet would not that bee enough both to besiege vs, and also to hinder vs from sayling into their Territories, and from taking reuenge with our Fleet, which is the thing wherein our strength lyeth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> For wee haue more experience in Land-seruice, by vse of the Sea, then they haue in Sea-seruice, by vse of the Land.

For they, vnlesse by the sword, can get no other Territory in stead of that wee shall destroy: Whereas for vs, there is other Land, both in the Ilands, and Continent: For the dominion of the Sea is a great matter. Consider but this; If we dwelt in the Ilands, whether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of vs then were more inexpugnable? Wee must therefore now, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as neere as can bee to that imagination, lay aside the care of Fields and Villages, and not for the losse of them, out of passion, giue battell to the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> farre more in number then our selues; (for though wee giue them an ouerthrow, wee must fight againe with as many more: and if wee bee ouerthrowne, we shall lose the helpe of our Confederates, which are our strength; for when we cannot warre vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they will revolt) nor bewaile yee the losse of Fields or Houses, but of mens bodies: for men may acquire these, but these cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire men.

                           </note> not onely our Fathers haue had many Warres, both within and without <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> but wee our selues also, such as are any thing in yeeres, haue beene sufficiently acquainted therewith; yet did wee neuer before set forth with so great a preparation as at this present.

                           <hi>Greece,</hi> is vp at this Commotion, obseruing vs: and through their hatred to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> doe wish that we may accomplish
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18271:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whatsoeuer wee intend. And therefore though wee seeme to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> them with a great Army, and to haue much assurance, that they will not come out against vs, to battell, yet wee ought not for this, to march the lesse carefully prepared, but of euery City, as well the Captaine, as the Souldier, to expect alwayes some danger or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in that part wherein hee himselfe is placed. For the accidents of Warre are vncertaine; and for the most part the Onset begins from the lesser number, and vpon passion. And oftentimes the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser number, being afraid, hath beaten backe the greater with the more ease, for that through contempt they haue gone vnprepared. And in the Land of an Enemie, though the Souldiers ought alwaies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to haue bold hearts, yet for action, they ought to make their preparations, as if they were afraid. For that will giue them both more courage to goe vpon the enemy, and more safety in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him. But wee invade not now a Citie that cannot defend it selfe, but a City euery way well appointed. So that wee must by all meanes expect to be fought withall, though not now, because we be not yet there, yet hereafter, when they shall see vs in their Countrey, wasting and destroying their possessions: For all men, when in their owne fight, and on a sudden, they receiue any extraordinary hurt, fall presently into choler; and the lesse they consider, with the more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> stomach they assault. And this is likely to hold in the <hi>Athenians</hi> somewhat more then in others; for they thinke themselues worthy to haue the command of others, and to inuade and waste the territory of their neighbours, rather then to see their neighbours waste theirs. Wherefore, as being to Warre against a great Citie, and to procure, both to your Ancestours and your selues, a great fame, eyther good or bad, as shall bee the event; follow your Leaders in such sort, as aboue all things you esteeme of order and watchfulnesse. For there is nothing in the world more comely, nor more safe, then when many men are seene to obserue one and the same order.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

For, to speake of men in a iust measure, is a hard matter and though one do so, yet he shall hardly get the truth firmely beleeued. the fauourable hearer, and hee that knowes what was done, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thinke what is spoken, short of what hee would haue it, and what it was; and hee that is ignorant, will finde somewhat on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which hee will thinke too much extolled; especially if hee heare ought aboue the pitch of his owne nature. For to heare another man praised, findes patience so long onely, as each man shall thinke he could himselfe haue done somewhat of that hee heares. And if one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in their praises, the hearer presently through enuie thinkes it false. But since our Ancestors haue so thought good, I also, following the same ordinance, must endeuour to bee answerable to the desires and opinions of euery one of you, as farre forth as I can. I will beginne at our Ancestours, being a thing both iust and honest, that to them first bee giuen the honour of remembrance in this kinde: For they hauing beene alwayes the inhabitants of this Region, by their valour haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the same to succession of posterity, hitherto, in the state of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: For which they deserue commendation; but our Fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue yet more; for that besides what descended on them, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> without great labour of their owne, they haue purchased this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Dominion, and deliuered the same ouer to vs that now are. Which in a great part also, wee our selues, that are yet in the strength of our age here present, haue enlarged; and so furnished the Citie with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, both for peace and warre, as it is now all suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The actions of Warre, whereby all this was attained, and the deedes of Armes, both of our selues and our Fathers, in valiant opposition to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> or <hi>Grecians,</hi> in their Warres against vs, amongst you that are well acquainted with the summe, to auoide prolixity, I will passe ouer. But by what institutions wee arriued at this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> forme of gouernment, and by what meanes we haue aduanced the State to this greatnesse, when I shall haue laide open this, I will then descend to these mens praises. For I thinke they are things both fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in hand, and profitable to the whole company, both of Citizens and Strangers, to heare related. Wee haue a forme of gouernment, not fetched by imitation from the Lawes of our neighbouring States, (nay, wee are rather a patterne to others, then they to vs) which, because in the administration, it hath respect, not to a few, but to the multitude, is called a <hi>Democracie.</hi> Wherein though there bee an equality amongst all men in point of Law, for their priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> yet in conferring of dignities, one man is preferred before another to publique charge, and that according to the reputation, not

Wee haue also found out many wayes to giue our mindes recreation from labour, by publike institution of Games and Sacrifices for all the dayes of the yeere,<note place="margin">

Wee haue this further, by the greatnesse of our City, that all things, from all parts of the Earth are imported hither; whereby we no lesse familiarly enioy the commodities of all other Nations, then our owne. Then in the studies of Warre, wee excell our Enemies in this: wee leaue aur Citie open to all men, nor was it euer seene, that by <note n="*" place="margin">This is spoken with enuie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> that prohibited Strangers to dwell amongst them.</note> banishing of strangers, we denyed them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the learning or sight of any of those things, which if not hidden, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie might reape aduantage by, not relying on secret preparation and deceipt, but vpon our owne courage in the action. They in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline hunt after valour, presently from their youth, with laborious exercise, and yet wee that liue remissely, vndertake as great dangers as they. For example, the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> inuade not our domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by themselues alone, but with the ayde of all the rest. But when wee inuade our neighbours, though wee fight in hostile ground, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as in their owne ground, fight in defence of their owne substance, yet for the most part wee get the victorie.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Neuer Enemie yet fell into the hands of our whole Forces at once, both because wee apply our selues much to Nauigation, and by Land also send many of our men into diuers Countries abroad. But when fighting with a part of it, they chance to get the better, they boast they haue beaten the whole; and when they get the worse, they say they are beaten by the whole. And yet when from ease, rather then studious labour, and vpon naturall, rather then doctrinall valour, wee come to vndertake any danger, wee haue this oddes by it, that we shall not faint before-hand with the meditation of future trouble, and in the action wee shall appeare no lesse confident then they that are euer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> toyling, procuring admiration to our Citie, as well in this, as in

For also in this we excell others; daring to vndertake as much as any, and yet examining what wee vndertake; whereas with other men, ignorance makes them dare, and consideration, dastards; and they are most rightly reputed vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who though they perfectly apprehend, both what is dangerous, and what is easie, are neuer the more thereby diuerted from aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing.

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> will afterwards confute the opinion conceiued of the actions. For we haue opened vnto vs by our courage, all Seas, and Lands, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18271:70"/>
set vp eternall Monuments on all sides, both of the euill we haue done <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to our enemies, and the good wee haue done to our friends. Such is the Citie for which these men (thinking it no reason to lose it) valiantly fighting, haue dyed. And it is fit that euery man of you that bee left, should bee like-minded, to vndergoe any trauell for the same. And I haue therefore spoken so much concerning the Citie in generall, as well to shew you, that the stakes betweene vs and them, whose Citie is not such; are not equall; as also to make knowne by effects, the worth of these men I am to speake of; the greatest part of their praises being therein already deliuered. For what I haue spoken of the Citie, hath by these and such as these beene atchieued: Neither would praises <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and actions appeare so leuelly concurrent in many other of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as they doe in these; the present revolution of these mens liues seeming vnto mee an argument of their vertues, noted in the first act thereof, and in the last confirmed. For euen such of them as were worse then the rest, doe neuerthelesse deserue that for their valour shewne in the Warres for defence of their Countrey, they should bee preferred before the rest. For hauing by their good actions abolished the memory of their euill, they haue profited the State thereby, more then they haue hurt it by their priuate behauiour. Yet there was none of these, that preferring the further fruition of his wealth, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> growne cowardly, or that for hope to ouercome his pouerty at length, and to attaine to riches, did for that cause withdraw himselfe from the danger. For their principall desire was not wealth, but reuenge on their Enemies, which esteeming the most honourable cause of danger, they made account through it, both to accomplish their reuenge, and to purchase wealth withall; putting the vncertainety of successe, to the a count of their hope; but for that which was before their eyes, rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon themselues in the Action; and therein chusing rather to fight and dye, then to shrinke and bee saued. They fled from shame, but with their bodies, they stood out the Battell; and so in a moment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> whilest Fortune inclineth neither way, left their liues not in feare, but in opinion of victory. Such were these men, worthy of their Country; and for you that remaine, you may pray for a safer furtune; but you ought not to bee lesse venturously minded against the enemie; not weighing the profit by an Oration onely, which any man amplifying, may recount, to you that know as well as hee, the many commodities that arise by fighting valiantly against your enemies, but contemplating the power of the Citie in the actions of the same from day to day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and thereby becomming enamoured of it. And when this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Citie shall seeme great to you, consider then, that the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was purchased by valiant men, and by men that know their duty, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18271:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by men that were sensible of dishonour when they were in fight; and by such men, as though they failed of their attempt, yet would not bee wanting to the Citie with their vertue, but made vnto it a most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable contribution. For hauing euery one giuen his body to the Common-wealth, they receiue in place thereof, an vndecaying commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and a most remarkeable Sepulcher, not wherein they are buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so much, as wherein their glory is laid vp, vpon all occasions, both of speech and action, to bee remembred for euer. For to famous men, all the earth is a Sepulcher: and their vertues shall bee testified, not onely by the inscription in stone at home, but by an vnwritten record of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the minde, which more then of any Monument, will remaine with euery one for euer. In imitation therefore of these men, and placing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse in liberty, and liberty in valour, bee forward to encounter the dangers of Warre. For the miserable and desperate men, are not they that haue the most reason to bee prodigall of their liues, but rather such men, as if they liue, may expect a change of fortune, and whose losses are greatest, if they miscarry in ought. For to a man of any spirit, Death, which is without sense, arriuing whilest hee is in vigour, and common hope, is nothing so bitter, as after a tender life to bee brought into miserie. Wherefore I will not so much bewaile, as comfort you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the parents, that are present, of these men. For you know that whilest they liued, they were obnoxious to manifold calamities, whereas whilest you are in griefe, they onely are happy, that dye honourably, as these haue done: and to whom it hath beene granted, not only to liue in prosperity, but to dye in it. Though it bee a hard matter to disswade you from sorrow, for the losse of that, which the <note n="*" place="margin">Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For the later children will both draw on with some the obliuion of those that are slaine, and also doubly conduce to the good of the Citie, by population and strength. For it is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they should equally giue good counsell to the State, that haue not children to bee equally exposed to danger in it. As for you that are past hauing of children, you are to put the former and greater part of your life, to the account of your gaine, and supposing the remainder of it will bee but short, you shall haue the glory of these for a consolation of the same. For the loue of honour neuer groweth old, nor doth that vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable part of our life take delight (as some haue said) in gathering of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> wealth, so much as it doth in being honoured. As for you that are the children or brethren of these men, I see you shall haue a difficult taske
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18271:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of aemulation. For euery man vseth to praise the dead; so that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with oddes of vertue, you will hardly get an equall reputation, but still be thought a little short. For men enuy their Competitors in glory, while they liue, but to stand out of their way, is a thing honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with an affection free from opposition. And since I must say somewhat also of feminine vertue, for you that are now Widdowes: I shall expresse it all in this short admonition. It will bee much for your honour; not to recede from your Sexe, and to giue as little occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of rumour amongst the men, whether of good or euill, as you can.

For this was a kind of sickenesse which farre surmounted all expression of words, and both exceeded hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, in the cruelty wherwith it handled each one, and appeared also otherwise to be none of those diseases that are bred amongst vs, and that especially by this. For all both birds and beasts,<note place="margin">Birds and Beasts perished that red on Carkasses.</note> that vse to feed on humane flesh, though many men lay abroad vnburied, either came not at them, or tasting perished. An argument whereof as touching the birds, is the manifest defect of such fowle,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which were not then seene, neither about the Carcasses, or any where else; But by the dogges, because they are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with men, this effect was seene much cleerer. So that this disease (to passe ouer many strange particulars, of the accidents, that some had differently, from others) was in generall such as I haue showne, and for other vsuall sickenesses, at that time, no man was troubled with any. Now they died,<note place="margin">Want of attendance.</note> some for want of attendance, and some againe with all the care and Physicke that could be vsed. Nor was there any, to say, certaine medicine, that applied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> must haue helped them; for if it did good to one, it did harme to another; nor any difference of body, for strength or weaknesse that was able to resist it; but it carried all away, what Physicke soeuer was administred. But the greatest misery of all was,<note place="margin">Deiection of mind.</note> the deiection of mind, in such as found themselues beginning to be sicke (for they grew presently desperate, and gaue themselues ouer without making any resistance) as also their dying thus like sheepe, infected by mutuall visitation, for the greatest mortality proceeded that way. For if men forbore to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them, for feare, then they dyed forlorne, whereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18271:72"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Families became empty, for want of such as should take care of them. If they forbore not, then they died themselues, and principally the honestest men. For out of shame, they would not spare themselues, but went in vnto their friends, especially after it was come to this passe, that euen their domestiques, wearied with the lamentations of them that died, and ouercome with the greatnesse of the calamity, were no longer moued therewith. But those that were recouered, had much compassion both on them that died, and on them that lay sicke, as hauing both knowne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the misery themselues, and now no more subiect to the danger.<note place="margin">No man sicke of it mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tally the second time.</note> For this disease neuer tooke any man the second time, so as to be mortall. And these men were both by others counted happy, and they also themselues, through excesse of present ioy, conceiued a kind of light hope, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to die of any other sickenesse hereafter. Besides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent affliction, the reception of the countrey people, and of their substance into the Citie, oppressed both them, and much more the people themselues that so came in. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no houses, but dwelling at that time of the yeere in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> stifling boothes, the mortality was now without all forme;<note place="margin">Men dyed in the streets.</note> and dying men lay tumbling one vpon another in the streetes, and men halfe dead, about euery Conduit through desire of water. The Temples also where they dwelt in Tents, were all full of the dead that died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them; for oppressed with the violence of the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and not knowing what to doe, men grew carelesse both of holy, and prophane things alike. And the Lawes which they formerly vsed touching Funerals, were all now broken; euery one burying where hee could finde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> roome. And many for want of things necessary, after so many deathes before, were forced to become impudent in the Funerals of their friends.<note place="margin">Disorder in their Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</note> For when one had made a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p>YOur anger towards me, commeth not vnlooked for, (for the causes of it I know) and I haue called this Assembly therefore, to remember you, and reprehend you for those things, wherin you haue either beene angry with me, or giuen way to your aduersity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> reason. For I am of this opinion, that the publike prosperity of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18271:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Citie, is better for priuate men, then if the priuate men themselues were in prosperity, and the publique wealth in decay. For a priuate man, though in good estate, if his Countrey come to ruine, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be ruined with it; whereas hee that miscarrieth, in a flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Common-wealth, shall much more easily be preserued. Since then the Common-wealth is able to beare the calamities of priuate men, and euery one cannot support the calamities of the Common-wealth, why should not euery one striue to defend it? and not (as you now, astonished with domestique misfortune) forsake the common safety, and fall a censuring both me that counselled the Warre, and your selues, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the same as well as I. And it is I you are angry withall, one, as I thinke my selfe, inferiour to none, either in knowing what is requisite, or in expressing what I know, and a louer of my Countrey, and superior to money. For he that hath good thoughts, and cannot cleerely expresse them, were as good to haue thought nothing at all. He that can do both, and is ill affected to his Countrey, will likewise not giue it faithfull counsell. And he that will doe that too, yet if he be superable by mony, will for that alone set all the rest to sale. Now if you followed my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in making this Warre, as esteeming these vertues to bee in mee, somewhat aboue the rest, there is sure no reason I should now be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of doing you wrong. For though to such as haue it in their owne ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (being otherwise in good estate) it were madnesse to make choice of Warre; yet when we must of necessitie, either giue way, and so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe, be subiect to our Neighbours, or else saue our selues from it by danger, he is more to be condemned that declineth the danger, then he that standeth to it. For mine owne part, I am the man I was, and of the minde I was, but you are changed, wonne to the Warre, when you were entire, but repenting it vpon the dammage, and condemning my counsell, in the weakenesse of your owne iudgement. The reason of this is, because you feele already euery one in particular, that which afflicts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> you, but the euidence of the profit to accrew to the Citie in generall, you see not yet. And your mindes deiected with the great and sudden alteratoin, cannot constantly maintaine what you haue before resolued. For that which is sodaine and vnexpected, and contrary to what one hath deliberated, enslaueth the spirit; which by this disease princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, in the necke of the other incommodities, is now come to passe in you. But you that are borne in a great Citie, and with education sute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, how great soeuer the affliction be, ought not to shrinke at it, and eclipse your reputation (for men doe no lesse condemne those that through cowardize lose the glory they haue, then hate those that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> through impudence, arrogate the glory they haue not) but to set aside the griefe of your priuate losses, and lay your hands to the common

That though you take your dominion to extend onely to your Confederates, I affirme that of the two parts of the world of manifest vse, the Land and the Sea, you are of the one of them, entire Masters, both of as much of it,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as you make vse of, and also of as much more as you shall thinke fit your selues. Neither is there any King or Nation whatsoeuer, of those that now are, that can impeach your Nauigation, with the Fleet and strength you now goe. So that you must not put the vse of Houses, and Lands, (wherein you now thinke your selues depriued of a mighty matter) into the ballance with such a power as this, nor take the losse of these things heauily in respect of it; but rather set lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by them, as but a light ornament and embellishment of wealth, and thinke, that our libertie, as long as we hold fast that, will easily reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto vs, these things againe; whereas subiected once to others,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> euen that which we possesse besides will be diminished. Shew not your selues both wayes inferiour to your Ancestors, who not onely held this (gotten by their owne labours, not left them) but haue also preserued, and deliuered the same vnto vs, (For it is more dishonour to lose what one possesseth, then to miscarrie in the acquisition of it) and encounter the enemie not onely with magnanimitie, but also with disdaine: for a coward may haue a high minde, vpon a prosperous ignorance, but he that is confident vpon iudgement to be superiour to his enemy, doth also disdaine him, which is now our case. And cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage (in equall fortune) is the safer for our disdaine of the enemy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> where a man knowes what he doth. For he trusteth lesse to hope, which is of force onely in vncertainties, and more to iudgement vpon certainties, wherein there is a more sure foresight. You haue reason besides to maintaine the dignitie the Citie hath gotten for her Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, (in which you all triumph) and either not decline the paines, or not also pursue the honour. And you must not thinke the question is now of your liberty, and seruitude onely; Besides the losse of your rule ouer others, you must stand the danger you haue contracted, by offence giuen in the administration of it. Nor can you now giue it ouer (if any fearing at this present, that that may come to passe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> himselfe with the intention of not to meddle hereafter) for

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> already your gouernment is in the nature of a tyranny, which is both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust for you to take vp, and vnsafe to lay downe. And such men as these, if they could perswade others to it, or liued in a free Citie by themselues, would quickly ouerthrow it. For the quiet life can neuer be preserued, if it be not ranged with the actiue life; nor is it a life conducible to a Citie that reigneth, but to a subiect Citie, that it may safely serue. Be not therfore seduced by this sort of men, nor angry with me, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with whom your selues did decree this Warre, because the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my inuading you hath done what was likely he would, if you obeyed him not. And as for the sickenesse (the onely thing that exceeded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the imagination of all men) it was vnlooked for, and I know you hate me somewhat the more for that, but vniustly, vnlesse when any thing falleth out aboue your expectation fortunate, you will also dedicate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me that. Euils that come from heauen, you must beare necessarily, and such as proceed from your enemies valiantly; for so it hath beene the custome of this Citie to doe heretofore, which custome let it not bee your part to reuerse: Knowing that this Citie hath a great name amongst all people, for not yeelding to aduersity, and for the mighty power it yet hath, after the expence of so many liues, and so much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Warre; the memory whereof, though we should now at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> length miscarry (for all things are made with this Law, to decay againe) will remaine with posterity for euer. How that being <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> most of the <hi>Grecians</hi> were our subiects; That we haue abidden the greatest Warres against them, both vniuersally and singly, And haue inhabited the greatest and wealthiest Citie, Now this, hee with the quiet life will condemne, the actiue man will aemulate, and they that haue not attained to the like, will enuy. But to be hated, and to displease, is a thing that happeneth for the time to whosoeuer hee be that hath the command of others; and he does well that vndergoeth hatred, for matters of great consequence. For the hatred lasteth not, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and is recompenced both with a present splendor, and an immortall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereafter. Seing then you foresee both what is honourable for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not dishonourable for the present, procure both the one, and the other by your courage now. Send no more Heraulds to the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians,</hi> nor let them know that the euill present does any way afflict you; for they whose mindes least feele, and whose actions most oppose a calamity, both amongst States, and priuate persons are the best.</p>

they, though for the State in generall, they were won, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sent to the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> no more, but rather enclined to the Warre, yet they were euery one in particular, grieued for their seuerall losses. The poore, because entring the Warre with little, they lost that little, and the rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had lost faire possessions, together with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houses, and costly furniture in them, in the Countrey; but the greatest matter of all was, that they had Warre in stead of Peace.<note place="margin">

Neuerthelesse, not long after, (as is the fashion of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> multitude) they made him Generall againe, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the whole State to his administration. For the sense of their domestique losses was now dulled, and for the need of the Common-wealth, they prised him more then any other whatsoeuer. For as long as he was in authority in the Citie, in time of Peace, he gouerned the same with moderation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Athens</hi> at the greatest in the time of <hi>Pericles.</hi>
               </note> and was a faithfull watchman of it, and in his time it was at the greatest. And after the Warre was on foot, it is manifest that he therein also fore-saw what it could doe.<note place="margin">The death of <hi>Pericles.</hi>
               </note> Hee liued after the Warre began, two yeeres <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and sixe moneths And his foresight in the Warre was best knowne after his <note n="*" place="margin">Plutarch <hi>sayes, he dyed of the Plague.</hi>
               </note> death. For he told them, that if they would be quiet, and looke to their Nauy, and during this Warre, seeke no further dominion, nor hazzard the Citie it selfe, they should then haue the vpper hand. But they did contrary in all, and in such other things besides, as seemed not to concerne the Warre, managed the State, according to their priuate ambition and couetousnesse, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiously both for themselues, and their Confederates. What succeeded well, the honour and profit of it, came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> most to priuate men; and what miscarried, was to the Cities detriment in the Warre. The reason whereof was this, that being a man of great power, both for his dignity and wisdome,<note place="margin">The commendation of <hi>Pericles.</hi>
               </note> &amp; for bribes, manifestly the most incorrupt, he freely controuled the multitude, and was not so much led by them, as he led them. Because (hauing gotten his power by no euill Artes) he would not humour them in his speeches, but out of his authority, durst anger them with contradiction. Therefore whensoeuer he saw them out of season insolently bold; he would with his Orations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> put them into a feare, and againe when they were afraid
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18271:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> without reason, he would likewise erect their spirits, and imbolden them. It was in name a State <hi>Democraticall,</hi> but in fact, <hi>A gouernment of the principall Man.</hi> But they that came after, being more equall amongst themselues, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting euery one to be the chiefe, applyed themselues to the people, and let goe the care of the Common-wealth. From whence, amongst many other errours, as was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a great and dominant Citie, proceeded also the voyage into <hi>Sicily,</hi> which was not so much vpon mistaking those whom they went against, as for want of knowledge in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> senders, of what was necessary for those that went the voyage. For through priuate quarrels about, who should beare the greatest sway with the people, they both abated the vigour of the Armie, and then also first troubled the State at home with diuision. Being ouerthrowne in <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and hauing lost, besides other ammunition, the greatest part of their Nauy, and the Citie being then in sedition, yet they held out 3 yeeres, both against their first enemies, and the <hi>Sicilians</hi> with them, and against most of their reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Confederates besides, and also afterwards against <hi>Cyrus</hi>

For you know, wee were inferiour to them then in preparation, and set not forth as to a fight at Sea, but rather to an expedition by Land. Fortune likewise crossed vs in many things; and somewhat wee miscarried by vnskilfulnesse: so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as the losse can no way be ascribed to cowardise. Nor is it iust, so long as we were not ouercome by meere force, but haue somewhat to alledge in our excuse, that the mind should bee deiected for the calamity of the euent. But we must thinke, that though Fortune may faile men, yet the courage of a valiant man can neuer faile: and not that we may iustifie cowardise in any thing, by pretending want of skill, and yet bee truely valiant. And yet you are not so much short of their skill, as you exceede them in valour. And though this knowledge of theirs, which you so much feare, ioyned with courage, will not bee without a memory also, to put what they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> know in execution, yet without courage, no act in the world is of any force in the time of danger. For feare confoundeth the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and skill without courage auaileth nothing. To their oddes therefore of skill, oppose your oddes of valour; and to the feare caused by your ouerthrow, oppose your being then vnprouided. You haue further now, a greater Fleet, and to fight on your owne shore; with your aydes at hand, of men of Armes: and for the most part, the greatest number, and best prouided, get the victory. So that wee can neither see any one cause in particular, why wee should miscarry; and whatsoeuer were our wants in the former Battell, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> supplyed in this, will now turne to our instruction. With cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage therefore, both Masters and Mariners, follow euery man in

                        <p>SOuldiers, hauing obserued your feare of the enemies number, I haue called you together, not enduring to see you terrified with things that are not terrible. For first, they haue prepared this great number, and oddes of Gallies, for that they were ouercome before, and because they are euen in their owne opinions too weake for vs. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> next, their present boldnesse proceeds onely from their knowledge in Land-seruice, in confidence whereof (as if to be valiant, were peculiar vnto them) they are now come vp; wherin hauing for the most part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered, they thinke to doe the same in seruice by Sea. But in reason the oddes must be ours in this, as well as it is theirs in the other kinde. For in courage they exceed vs not, and as touching the aduantage of either side, we may better be bold now, then they. And the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> who are the leaders of the Confederates, bring them to fight, for the greatest part (in respect of the opinion they haue of vs) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their wills. For else they would neuer haue vndertaken a new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> battaile, after they were once so cleerely ouerthrowne. Feare not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18271:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> any great boldnesse on their part. But the feare which they haue of you, is farre, both greater, and more certaine, not onely for that you haue ouercome them before, but also for this, that they would neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue you would goe about to resist, vnlesse you had some notable thing to put in practice vpon them. For when the enemy is the greater number as these are now, they invade chiefly vpon confidence of their strength. But they that are much the fewer must haue some great and sure designe when they dare fight vnconstrained. Wherewith these men now amazed, feare vs more for our vnlikely preparation, then they would if it were more proportionable. Besides, many great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Armies haue beene ouercome by the lesser, through vnskilfulnesse, and some also by timorousnesse, both which we our selues are free from. As for the battaile, I will not willingly fight it in the Gulfe, nor goe in thither; seeing that to a few Gallies with nimblenesse and art, against many without art, streightnesse of roome is disaduantage. For neither can one charge with the beake of the Gallie as is fit, vnlesse hee haue sight of the enemy a farre off, or if he be himselfe ouer-pressed, againe get cleere. Nor is there any getting through them, or turning to and fro, at ones pleasure, which are all the workes of such Gallies, as haue their aduantage in agility; but the Sea-fight would of necessitie be the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> same with a battaile by Land, wherein the greater number must haue the better. But of this, I shall my selfe take the best care I am able. In the meane time keepe you your order well in the Gallies, and euery man receiue his charge readily; and the rather because the enemy is at Anchor so neere vs. In the fight, haue in great estimation, order and silence, as things of great force in most Military actions, especially in a fight by Sea; and charge these your enemies according to the worth of your former Acts. You are to fight for a great wager, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to destroy the hope of the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> Nauies, or to bring the feare of the Sea neerer home to the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Againe, let mee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> tell you, you haue beaten them once already; and men once ouercome, will not come againe to the danger so well resolued as before. <hi>Thus did</hi> Phormio <hi>also encourage his Souldiers.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>MEN of Lacedaemon, and Confederates,</hi> We know the receiued custome of the <hi>Grecians:</hi> For they that take into League such as reuolt in the Warres, and relinquish a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> former League, though they like them as long as they haue profit by them, yet accounting them but Traitours to their former Friends, they esteeme the worse of them in their iudgement. And to say the truth, this iudgement is not without good reason, when they that reuolt, and they from whom the reuolt is made, are mutually like-minded and affected, and equall in prouision and strength, and no iust cause of their reuolt giuen. But now betweene vs and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> it is not so. Nor let any man thinke the worse of vs, for that hauing beene honoured by them in time of peace, we haue now reuolted in time of danger. For the first point of our speech, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> now we seeke to come into League with you, shall bee to make good the iustice and honesty of our reuolt. For we know there can
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18271:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bee neither firme friendship betweene man and man, nor any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> betweene Citie and Citie to any purpose whatsoeuer, without a mutuall opinion of each others honesty, and also a similitude of customes otherwayes. For in the difference of mindes is grounded the diuersity of actions. As for our League with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> it was first made, when you gaue ouer the <hi>Medan</hi> Warre, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to prosecute the reliques of that businesse: Yet wee entred not such a League, as to be their helpers in bringing the <hi>Grecians</hi> into the seruitude of the <hi>Athenians;</hi> but to set free the <hi>Grecians</hi> from the seruitude of the <hi>Medes.</hi> And as long as they led vs as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, wee followed them with much zeale; but when wee saw they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> remitted their enmity against the <hi>Medes,</hi> and led vs to the subiuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Confederates, we could not then but bee afraid. And the Confederates through the multitude of distinct Councels, vnable to vnite themselues for resistance, fell all but our selues and the <hi>Chians</hi> into their subiection; and wee hauing still our owne Lawes, and being in name a free State, followed them to the Warres; but so, as by the examples of their former actions, we held them not any longer for faithfull Leaders. For it was not probable, when they had subdued those, whom together with vs they tooke into league, but that, when they should bee able, they would doe the like also by the rest. It is true that if we were now in liberty all, wee might bee the better assured,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that they would forbeare to innouate; but since they haue vnder them the greatest part already, in all likelihood they will take it ill, to deale on equall termes with vs alone; and the rest yeelding, to let vs onely stand vp as their equals. Especially when by how much they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come stronger by the subiection of their Confederates, by so much the more are wee become desolate. But the equality of mutuall feare, is the onely band of faith in Leagues. For hee that hath the will to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, yet when he hath not the oddes of strength, will abstaine from comming on. Now the reason why they haue left vs yet free, is no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> other, but that they may haue a faire colour to lay vpon their domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ouer the rest; and because it hath seemed vnto them more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to take vs in by policy, then by force. For therein they made vse of vs, for an argument, that hauing equall vote with them, wee would neuer haue followed them to the Warres, if those against whom they led vs, had not done the iniury. And thereby also they brought the stronger against the weaker, and reseruing the strongest to the last, made them the weaker, by remouing the rest. Whereas if they had begunne with vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the Confederates had had both their owne strength, and a side to adhere to, they had neuer subdued them so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Likewise our Nauy kept them in some feare, lest vnited and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18271:93"/>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> added to yours, or to any other, it might haue created them some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Partly also we escaped by our obseruance toward their Commons and most eminent men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from time to time. But yet we still thought we could not doe so long, considering the examples they haue shewed vs in the rest, if this Warre should not haue fallen out. What friendship then or assurance of liberty was this, when we receiued each other with alienated affections? when whilst they had Warres, they for feare courted vs, and when they had Peace, we for feare courted them? and whereas in others, good will assureth loyalty, in vs it was the effect of feare? So it was more for feare then loue, that we remained their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Confederates; and whomsoeuer security should first embolden, he was first likely by one meanes or other to breake the league. Now if any man thinke we did vniustly, to reuolt vpon the expectation of euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, without staying to be certaine, whether they would doe it or not, he weigheth not the matter aright. For if we were as able to contriue euill against them, and againe to deferre it, as they can against vs, being thus equall, what needed vs to be at their discretion? But seeing it is in their hands to inuade at pleasure, it ought to be in ours to anticipate. Vpon these pretentions therefore, and causes, <hi>Men of Lacedaemon &amp; Confederates,</hi> we haue reuolted; the which are both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> cleare enough for the hearers to iudge vpon, that we had reason for it, and weighty enough to affright, and compell vs to take some course for our owne safety; which we would haue done before, when before the Warre, we sent Ambassadours to you about our reuolt, but could not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you would not then admit vs into your league. And now when the <hi>Boeotians</hi> inuited vs to it, we presently obeyed. Wherein wee thought we made a double reuolt, one from the <hi>Grecians,</hi> in ceasing to doe them mischiefe with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and helping to set them free; and another from the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in breaking first, and not staying to be destroyed by them hereafter. But this reuolt of ours hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> beene sooner then was fit, and before we were prouided for it. For which cause also the Confederates ought so much the sooner to admit vs into the league, and send vs the speedier aide, thereby the better, at once, both to defend those you ought to defend, and to annoy your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Whereof there was neuer better opportunity then at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. For the <hi>Athenians</hi> being both with the likenesse, and their great expences consumed, and their Nauy diuided, part vpon your own Coasts, and part vpon ours, it is not likely they should haue many Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies spare, in case you againe this Summer inuade them, both by Sea and Land; but that they should either be vnable to resist the inuasion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of your Fleet or be forced to come off from both our Coastes. And let not any man conceiue that you shall herein, at your owne danger
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18271:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
defend the Territory of another. For though <hi>Lesbos</hi> seeme remote,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the profit of it will be neere you. For the Warre will not be, as a man would thinke, in <hi>Attica,</hi> but there, from whence commeth the profit to <hi>Attica.</hi> This profit is the reuenue they haue from their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; which if they subdue vs, will still be greater. For neither will any other reuolt, and all that is ours will accrew vnto them; and wee shall be worse handled besides, then those that were vnder them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But aiding vs with diligence you shall both adde to your league a Citie, that hath a great Nauy (the thing you most stand in need of) and also easily ouerthrow the <hi>Athenians</hi> by subduction of their Confederates; because euery one will then be more confident to come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you shall auoyd the imputation of not assisting such as reuolt vnto you. And if it appeare that your endeuour is to make them free, your strength in this Warre will be much the more confirmed. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence therefore of the hopes which the <hi>Grecians</hi> haue reposed in you, and of the presence of <hi>Iupiter Olympius,</hi> in whose Temple here, we are in a manner suppliants to you, receiue the <hi>Mitylenians</hi> into league, and ayde vs. And doe not cast vs off, who, (though, as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of our persons, the danger be our owne) shall bring a common profit to all <hi>Greece,</hi> if we prosper, and a more common detriment to all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> if through your inflexiblenesse we miscarry. Be you therefore men, such as the <hi>Grecians</hi> esteeme you, and our feares re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> you to be. <hi>In this manner spake the</hi> Mitylenians,</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> These two Walles were distant one from the other about sixteene foot; and that sixteene foot of space which was betwixt them, was disposed and built into Cabines for the Watchmen, which were so ioyned and continued one to another, that the whole appeared to be one thicke Wall, with Battlements on either side.

And first they passed the Ditch that was about the Towne, and then came vp close to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Wall of the Enemy, who, because it was darke, could not see them comming; and the noyse they made as they went could not be heard for the blustering of the wind. And they came on besides at a good distance one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they might not bee betrayed by the clashing of their Armes; and were but lightly armed, and not shod but on the left foot, for the more steddinesse in the wet. They came thus to the Battlements, in one of the spaces betweene Towre and Towre, knowing that there was now no Watch kept there. And first came they that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Ladders, and placed them to the Wall; then 12. lightly armed, onely with a Dagger and a Brestplate, went

vp, led by <hi>Ammeas,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Coraebus,</hi> who was the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> first that mounted; and they that followed him, went vp into either Towre 6. To these succeeded others lightly-armed, that carryed the Darts, for whom they that came after, carried Targets at their backes, that they might bee the more expedite to get vp, which Targets they were to deliuer to them, when they came to the Enemy. At length, when most of them were ascended, they were heard by the Watchmen that were in the Towres; for one of the <hi>Plataeans</hi> taking hold of the Battlements, threw downe a Tyle, which made a noyse in the fall; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there was an Alarme. And the Armie ran to the Wall; for in the darke and stormie night, they knew not what the danger was. And the <hi>Plataeans</hi> that were left in the Citie, came forth withall, and assaulted the Wall of the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> on the opposite part to that where their men went ouer. So that though they were all in a tumult in their seuerall places, yet not any of them that watched, durst stirre to the ayde of the rest, nor were able to conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture what had happened. But <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>There is no mention of these</hi> 300. <hi>where the Author rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the laying of the siege: But it must be vnderstood.</hi>
               </note> those three hundred that were appointed to assist the Watch vpon all occasions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> neede, went without the Wall, and made towards the place of the clamor. They also held vp the fires, by which they vsed to make knowne the approach of Enemies, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Thebes.</hi> But then the <hi>Plataeans</hi> likewise, held out many other fires from the Wall of the Citie, which for that purpose they had before prepared, to render the fires of the Enemie insignificant, and that the <hi>Thebans</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the matter otherwise then it was, might forbeare to send help, till their men were ouer, and had recouered some place of safety.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time, those <hi>Plataeans,</hi> which hauing scaled the Wall first, and slaine the Watch, were now masters of both the Towres, not onely guarded the passages, by standing themselues in the entries, but also applying Ladders from the Wall to the Towres, and conueying many men to the toppe, kept the enemies off with shot, both from aboue and below. In the meane space, the greatest number of them hauing reared to the Wall many Ladders at once, and beaten downe the Battlements, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed quite ouer betweene the Towres, and euer as any of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them got to the other side, they stood still vpon the brinke
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18271:97"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the Ditch without, and with Arrowes and Darts, kept off those that came by the outside of the Wall to hinder their passage. And when the rest were ouer, then last of all, and with much adoe, came they also downe to the Ditch, which were in the two Towres. And by this time, the three hundred that were to assist the Watch, came and set vpon them, and had lights with them; by which meanes the <hi>Plataeans</hi> that were on the further brinke of the Ditch, discerned them the better from out of the darke, and aimed their Arrowes and Darts at their most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> disarmed parts. For, standing in the darke, the lights of the Enemie made the <hi>Plataeans</hi> the lesse discernable. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as these last passed the Ditch, though with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and force. For the Water in it was frozen ouer, though not so hard as to beare, but watrie, and such as when the Wind is at East, rather then at North: and the Snow which fell that night, together with so great a Wind as that was, had very much increased the Water, which they waded thorow, with scarce their heads aboue. But yet the greatnesse of the storme was the principall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> meanes of their escape.</p>
            <p>From the Ditch, the <hi>Plataeans,</hi> in troope, tooke the way towards <hi>Thebes,</hi> leauing on the left hand the <hi>Temple of Iuno,</hi> built by <hi>Androcrates,</hi> both for that they supposed, they would least suspect the way that led to their Enemies, and also because they saw the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> with their lights pursue that way, which by Mount <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> and the <hi>Oake-heads,</hi> led to <hi>Athens.</hi> The <hi>Plataeans,</hi> when they had gone 6. or 7.

Nor doe you consider, that your gouernment is a Tyranny, and those that be subiect to it, are against their willes so, and are plotting continually against you, and obey you not for any good turne, which to your owne detriment you shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> doe them, but onely for that you exceed them in strength, and for no good will. But the worst mischiefe of all is this, that nothing wee decree shall stand firme, and that we will not know, that a City with the worse Lawes, if immoueable, is better then one with good Lawes, when they bee not binding; and that a plaine wit accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with modesty, is more profitable to the State, then dexterity with arrogance; and that the more ignorant sort of men, doe for the most part better regulate a Common-wealth, then they that are wiser. For these loue to appeare wiser then the Lawes, and in all publike debatings to carry the victory, as the worthiest things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wherein to shew their wisdome; from whence most commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the ruine of the States they liue in. Whereas the other sort, mistrusting their owne wits, are content to be esteemed not so wise as the Lawes, and not able to carpe at what is well spoken by another; and so making themselues equall Iudges, rather then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders for mastery, gouerne a State for the most part well. Wee therefore should doe the like, and not be carried away with combates of eloquence and wit, to giue such counsell to your multitude, as in our owne iudgements wee thinke not good.

doe the iniury. For the sufferer by this meanes comes vpon the doer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with his anger dulled, whereas reuenge, the opposite of iniurie, is then greatest, when it followes presently.

You are excellent men for one to deceiue with a speech of a new straine, but backward to follow any tryed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: slaues to strange things, contemners of things vsuall. You would euery one chiefly giue the best aduice, but if you cannot, then you will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> contradict those that doe.

Wherein with the best successe, wee recouer but an exhausted Citie, and lose that, wherein our strength lyeth, the reuenue of it; but miscarrying, wee adde these Enemies to our former; and must spend that time in warring against our owne Confederates, which wee needed to employ against the Enemies, we haue already. Wee must not therefore giue our Confederates hope of pardon, either impetrable by words, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> purchaseable by money, as if their errours were but such as are commonly incident to humanity. For these did vs not an iniury
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18271:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnwillingly, but wittingly conspired against vs; whereas it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ought to bee inuoluntary, whatsoeuer is pardonable. Therefore both then at first, and now againe I maintaine, that you ought not to alter your former Decree, nor to offend in any of these three most disaduantagious things to Empire, <hi>Pittie, Delight in plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible speeches,</hi> and <hi>Lenity.</hi> As for <hi>Pitty,</hi> it is iust to shew it on them that are like vs, and will haue pitty againe; but not vpon such as not onely would not haue had pitty vpon vs, but must also of necessity haue beene our enemies for euer hereafter. And for the <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> that <hi>delight</hi> you with their <hi>Orations,</hi> let them play their prizes in matters of lesse weight, and not in such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wherein the City for a little pleasure, must suffer a great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, but they for their well speaking, must well <note n="*" place="margin">Meaning that the Orators are bribed and hired to giue counsell to the Common-wealth, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of other States.</note> haue. Lastly for <hi>Lenity,</hi> it is to be vsed towards those that will be our friends hereafter, rather then towards such, as being suffered to liue, will still be as they are, not a iot the lesse our enemies. In summe I say onely this, that if you follow my aduice, you shall doe that, which is both iust in respect of the <hi>Mitylenians,</hi> and profitable for your selues; whereas if you decree otherwise, you doe not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them, but condemne your selues. For if these haue iustly reuolted, you must vniustly haue had dominion ouer them. Nay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> though your dominion be against reason, yet if you resolue to hold it, you must also, as a matter conducing thereunto, against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son punish them; or else you must giue your dominion ouer, that you may be good without danger. But if you consider what was likely they would haue done to you, if they had preuailed, you cannot but thinke them worthy the same punishment; nor be lesse sensible you that haue escaped, then they that haue conspired; especially they hauing done the iniurie first. For such as doe an iniury without precedent cause, persecute most, and euen to the death, him they haue done it to; as iealous of the danger his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Enemy may create him. For hee that is wronged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause, and escapeth, will commonly bee more cruell, then if it were against any Enemy on equall quarell. Let vs not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore betray our selues, but in contemplation of what you were neere suffering, and how you once prized aboue all things else, to haue them in your power, requite them now accordingly. Bee not softned at the sight of their present estate, nor forget the danger that hung ouer our own heads so lately: Giue not onely vnto these their deserued punishment, but also vnto the rest of our Confederates a cleere example, that death is their sentence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whensoeuer they shall rebell. Which when they know, you shall

                           <hi>Mitylenians,</hi> to be againe debated, nor commend those that find fault with often consulting in affaires of great importance. But I am of opinion that nothing is so contrary to good counsell as these two, <hi>haste</hi> and <hi>anger</hi>: whereof the one is euer accompanied with mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the other with want of iudgement. And whosoeuer main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, that words are not instructers to deeds, either hee is not wise, or doth it vpon some priuate interest of his owne. Not wise, if hee thinke that future and not apparent things, may bee demonstrated otherwise then by words: Interessed, if desiring to carry an ill matter, and knowing that a bad cause will not beare a good speech, hee goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to deterre his opposers and hearers by a good calumniation. But they, of all others, are most intolerable, that when men giue publike aduice, will accuse them also of bribery. For if they charged a man with no more, but ignorance, when he had spoken in vaine, hee might yet depart with the opinion of a foole. But when they impute corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on also, if his counsell take place, he is still suspected, and if it doe not take place, he shall be held not onely a foole, but also voide of honesty. The Common-wealth gets no good by such courses; for through feare heereof, it will want counsellours, and the State would doe their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for the most part well, if this kinde of Citizens were they that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> had least ability in speaking; for they should then perswade the City to the fewer errours. For a good Statesman should not goe about to terrifie those that contradict him, but rather to make good his counsell vpon liberty of speech. And a wise State ought not, either to adde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or on the other side, to derogate from the honour of him that giueth good aduice; nor yet punish, nay nor disgrace the man whose counsell they receiue not. And then, neither would hee that lighteth on good aduice, deliuer any thing against his owne conscience, out of ambition of further honour, and to please the Auditory; nor hee that doth not, couet thereupon, by gratifying the people some way or other, that hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> also may endeere them. But wee doe here the contrary, and besides, if any man be suspected of corruption, though hee giue the best counsell
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18271:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that can be giuen, yet through enuy, for this vncertaine opinion of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> gaine, we lose a certaine benefit to the Common-wealth. And our custome is to hold good counsell, giuen suddenly, no lesse suspect, then bad. By which meanes, as he that giues the most dangerous counsell, must get the same receiued, by fraud; so also he that giues the most sound aduice, is forced by lying to get himselfe beleeued. So that, the Common-wealth is it alone, which by reason of these suspitious imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, no man can possibly benefit, by the plaine and open way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out artifice. For if any man shall doe a manifest good vnto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, he shall presently be suspected of some secret gaine vnto himselfe in particular. We therefore, that in the most important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and amidst these iealousies doe giue our aduice, haue need to foresee farther then you, that looke not farre, and the rather, because we stand accountable for our counsell, and you are to render no account of your hearing it. For if the perswader, and the perswaded, had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall harme, you would be the more moderate Iudges. But now, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the passion that takes you, when at any time your affaires mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary you punish the sentence of that one onely that gaue the counsell, not the many sentences of your owne, that were in fault as well as his. For my owne part, I stood not forth with any purpose of contradiction, in the businesse of the <hi>Mitylenians,</hi> nor to accuse any man. For wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> contend not now, if we be wise, about the iniury done by them, but about the wisest counsell for our selues. For how great soeuer be their fault, yet I would neuer aduise to haue them put to death, vnlesse it bee for our profit; nor yet would I pardon them, though they were pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, vnlesse it be good for the Common-wealth. And in my opinion, our deliberation now is of the future, rather then of the present. And whereas <hi>Cleon</hi> contendeth, that it will be profitable for the future, to put them to death, in that it will keepe the rest from rebelling, I, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending likewise for the future, affirme the contrary. And I desire you not to reiect the profit of my aduice, for the faire pretexts of his,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which agreeing more with your present anger against the <hi>Mityleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> may quickly perhaps win your consent. We pleade not iudicially with the <hi>Mitylenians,</hi> so as to need arguments of equity, but we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of them, which way we may serue our selues of them to our most aduantage hereafter. I say therefore, that death hath been in States, ordained for a punishment of many offences, and those not so great, but farre lesse then this. Yet encouraged by hope, men hazzard themselues. Nor did any man euer yet enter into a practice, which he knew he could not goe through with. And a Citie when it reuolueth, supposeth it selfe to be better furnished, either of themselues, or by their Confederates,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then it is, or else it would neuer take the enterprise in hand. They haue
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18271:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it by nature, both men and Cities to commit offences; nor is there any Law that can preuent it. For men haue gone ouer all degrees of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, augmenting them still, in hope to be lesse annoyed by Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; and it is likely that gentler punishments were inflicted of old, euen vpon the most haynous crimes; but that in tract of time, men continuing to transgresse, they were extended afterwards, to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of life; and yet they still transgresse. And therefore either some greater terrour then death must be deuised, or death will not bee enough for coertion. For pouerty will alwayes adde boldnesse to neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity; and wealth, couetousnesse to pride and contempt. And the other. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>[middle] fortunes, they also through humane passion, according as they are seuerally subiect to some insuperable one or other, impell men to danger. But <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Desire,</hi> worke this effect in all estates. And this as the Leader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that as the companion; this contriuing the enterprize, that suggesting the successe, are the cause of most crimes that are committed. And being least discerned, are more mischieuous, then euils seene. Besides these two, Fortune also puts men forward as much as any thing else. For presenting her selfe sometimes vnlookt for, she prouoketh some to aduenture, though not prouided, as they ought for the purpose; and specially Cities; because they venture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for the greatest matters, as liberty and dominion ouer others; and amongst a generality, euery one, though without reason, somewhat the more magnifies himselfe in particular. In a word, it is a thing impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of great simplicitie to beleeue, when humane nature is earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent to doe a thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by force of Law, or any other danger, it can be diuerted. We must not therefore, relying on the security of capitall punishment, decree the worst against them, nor make them desperate, as if there were no place to repent, and as soone as they can, to cancell their offence. For obserue; if a Citie reuolted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should know it could not hold out, it would now compound, whilst it were able, both to pay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vs our charges for the present, and our tribute for the time to come. But the way that <hi>Cleon</hi> prescribeth, what Citie, thinke you, would not prouide it selfe better, then this did; and endure the siege to the very last, if to compound late, and soone be all one? And how can it be but detriment to vs, to be at charge of long sieges, through their obstinacy, and when we haue taken a Citie, to finde it exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, and to lose the reuenue of it for the future? And this reuenue is the onely strength we haue against our enemies. Wee are not then to be exact Iudges in the punition of offenders, but to looke rather how by their moderate punishment, we may haue our Confederate Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> such as they may be able to pay vs tribute; and not thinke to keepe them in awe by the rigour of Lawes, but by the prouidence of

Consider also, if you follow the aduice of <hi>Cleon,</hi> how much you shall offend likewise in this other point.

But if you shall destroy the Commonalty of the <hi>Mitylenians,</hi> which did neither partake of the reuolt, and as soone as they were armed, presently deliuered the Citie into your hands, you shall first doe vniustly to kill such as haue done you seruice, and you shall effect a worke besides, which the <hi>great men</hi> doe euery where most desire.

But now we feare we haue beene deceiued in both. For we haue reason to suspect, both that the tryall is capitall, and you the Iudges partiall. Gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring so much, both from that, that there hath not been presented any accusation, to which we might answer, and also from this, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> interrogatory is short, and such, as if we answer to it with truth, we shall speake against our selues; and be easily conuinced, if we lie. But since we are on all hands, in a straight, we are forced (and it seemes our safest way) to try what we can obtaine by pleading. For, for men in our case, the speech not spoken, may giue occasion to some to thinke, that spoken, it had preserued vs. But besides other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, the meanes also of perswasion, goe ill on our side. For if we had not knowne one another, we might haue helped our selues by producing testimony in things you knew not. Whereas now, all that we shall say, will be before men that know already what it is. And we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> feare, not that you meane, because you know vs inferiour in vertue to your selues, to make that a crime, but lest you bring vs to a iudgement already iudged, to gratifie some body else.

                           <hi>Peace,</hi> and in the Warre against the <hi>Medes,</hi> we behaued our selues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the <hi>one,</hi> we brake not first, and in the <hi>other,</hi> we were the onely Boeotians that ioyned with you for the deliuery of <hi>Greece.</hi> For though we dwell vp in the land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet we fought by Sea at <hi>Artemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sium,</hi> and in the battell, fought in this our own territory we were with you; and whatsoeuer dangers the <hi>Grecians</hi> in those times vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, we were partakers of all, euen beyond our strength. And vnto you <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> in particular, when <hi>Sparta</hi> was in greatest affright, after the Earthquake, vpon the Rebellion of the <hi>Helotes,</hi> and seazing of <hi>Ithome,</hi> we sent the third part of our power to assist you, which you haue no reason to forget. Such then wee shewed our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> selues in those ancient and most important affaires. It is true, wee haue beene your enemies since, but for that you are to blame your selues. For when oppressed by the <hi>Thebans,</hi> we sought league of you, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected vs, and bade ws goe to the <hi>Athenians</hi> that were neerer hand, your selues being farre off. Neuerthelesse, you neither haue in this Warre, nor were to haue suffered at our hands any thing that mis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vs. And if we denyed to reuolt from the <hi>Athenians,</hi> when you bade vs, we did you no iniury in it. For they both ayded vs against the <hi>Thebans,</hi> when you shrunke from vs; and it was now no more any honesty to betray them. Especially hauing beene well vsed by them, and we our selues hauing sought their league, and been made denizens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> also of their Citie. Nay, we ought rather to haue followed them in all their commands with alacrity. When <hi>You,</hi> or the <hi>Athenians</hi> haue the leading of the Confederates, if euill be done, not they that follow are culpable, but you that lead to the euill. The <hi>Thebans</hi> haue done vs many other iniuries; but this last, which is the cause of what wee now suffer, you your selues know what it was. For we auenged vs but iustly of those that in time of Peace, and vpon the day of our <hi>Noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luniall Sacrifice,</hi> had surprized our Citie; and by the Law of all Nations it is lawfull to repell an assailing enemy; and therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> there is no reason you should punish vs now for them. For if you shall measure Iustice by your, and their present benefit in the Warre, it will manifestly appeare, that you are not <hi>Iudges</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specters</hi> onely of your <hi>profit.</hi> And yet if the <hi>Thebans</hi> seeme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to you now, we, and the rest of the <hi>Grecians</hi> were more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to you then, when you were in greater danger. For though the <hi>Thebans</hi> are now on your side, when you inuade others; yet at that time when the <hi>Barbarian</hi> came in to impose seruitude on all, they were on his. It is but Iustice, that with our present offence (if wee haue committed any) you compare our forwardnesse then; which you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> will finde both greater then our fault, and augmented also by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance

And we <hi>Plataeans,</hi> who euen beyond our strength haue been zealous in the defence of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> are now abandoned and left vnreleeued by them all.

For though to take away our liues be a matter quickely done yet to make the infamy of it cease, will be worke enough. For being none of your enemies, but welwillers, and such as haue entred into the Warre vpon constraint, you cannot put <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vs to death with Iustice. Therefore if you will iudge vncorruptly, you ought to secure our persons, and to remember that you receiued vs by

our owne voluntary submission, and with hands vpheld (and it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Law among <hi>Grecians,</hi> not to put such to death) besides that, we haue from time to time been beneficiall to you. For looke vpon the sepulchres of your Fathers, whom slaine by the <hi>Medes,</hi> and buried in this Territory of ours, we haue yeerely honoured at the publike charge, both with Vestments and other Rites; and of such things as our Land hath produced, we haue offered vnto them the first fruits of it all, as friends in an amicable Land, and Confederats vse to doe, to those that haue formerly been their fellowes in Armes. But now by a wrong sentence, you shall doe the contrary of this. For consider this: <hi>Pausanias,</hi> as he thought, enterred these men in ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ground, and amongst their friends. But you, if you slay vs, and of <hi>Plataeis,</hi> make <hi>Thebais,</hi> what doe you but leaue your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and kinred depriued of the honours they now haue, in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile Territory, and amongst the very men that slew them? And moreouer, put into seruitude that soyle whereon the <hi>Grecians</hi> were put into liberty? and make desolate the Temples wherein they prayed, when they preuailed against the <hi>Medes?</hi> and destroy the Patriall sacrifices which were instituted by the Builders and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the same?</p>
                        <p>These things are not for your glory, <hi>men of Lacedaemon,</hi> nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to violate the common institutions of <hi>Greece,</hi> and wrong your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, nor to destroy vs that haue done you seruice, for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of another, when you haue receiued no iniury from vs your selues. But to spare our liues, to relent, to haue a moderate compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, in contemplation, not onely of the greatnesse of the punishment, but also of who we are, that must suffer, and of the vncertainty where calamity may light, and that vndeseruedly; which wee, (as becommeth vs, and our need compelleth vs to doe) cry aloud vnto the common gods of <hi>Greece</hi> to perswade you vnto; producing the oath sworne by your Fathers, to put you in minde; and also wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> become here, Sanctuary men, at the sepulchres of your Fathers, crying out vpon the dead, not to suffer themselues to be in the power of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> nor to let their greatest friends be betrayed into the hands of their greatest enemies; remembring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that day, vpon which, though we haue done glorious acts in their company, yet wee are in danger at this day of most miserable suffering. But to make an end of speaking (which is, as necessary, so most bitter to men in our case, because the hazzard of our liues commeth so soone after,) for a conclusion we say, that it was not to the <hi>Thebans</hi> that we rendred our Citie (for we would rather haue dyed of Famine, the most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> base perdition of all other) but we came out on trust in you.

The quarell betweene vs and them, arose at first from this, that when wee had built <hi>Plataea</hi> last of all the Cities of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> together with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> places, which, hauing driuen out the promiscuous Nations, wee had then in our dominion, they would not (as was ordained at first) allow vs to be their Leaders, but beeing the onely men of all the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> that transgressed the common ordinance of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, when they should haue beene compelled to their duty, they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and together with them did vs many euils, for which they likewise suffered as many from vs. But when the <hi>Barbarian</hi> inuaded <hi>Greece,</hi> then, say they, that they of all the <hi>Boeotians</hi> onely also, Medized not. And this is the thing wherein they both glory most themselues, and most detract <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> from vs. Now wee confesse they Medized not, because also the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> did not. Neuerthelesse when the <hi>Athenians</hi> afterwards
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18271:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inuaded the rest of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> in the same kinde then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of all the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> they onely Atticized. But take now into your consideration withall, what forme of gouernment we were in both the one and the other, when wee did this.

You became, you say, Confederates and Denizens of <hi>Athens,</hi> for to bee righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against vs; against vs then onely the <hi>Athenians</hi> should haue come with you, and not you with them haue gone to the inuasion of the rest; especially, when if the <hi>Athenians</hi> would haue led you whither you would not, you had the League of the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> made with you against the <hi>Medes,</hi> which you so often obiect, to haue resorted vnto; which was sufficient not onely to haue prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> you from vs, but which is the maine matter, to haue secured you to take what course you had pleased. But voluntarily, and without constraint, you rather chose to follow the <hi>Athenians.</hi> And you say it had beene a dishonest thing, to haue betrayed your benefactors. But it is more dishonest, and more vniust by farre, to betray the <hi>Grecians</hi> vniuersally, to whom you haue sworne, then to betray the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> alone; especially when these goe about to deliuer <hi>Greece</hi> from subiection, and the other to subdue it. Besides, the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall you make the <hi>Athenians</hi> is not proportionable, nor free from dishonesty; for you, as you say your selues, brought in the <hi>Athenians</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to right you against iniuries, and you cooperate with them in iniurying
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18271:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> others. And howsoeuer, it is not so dishonest to leaue a benefit vnrequited, as to make such a requitall, as though iustly due, cannot be iustly done. But you haue made it apparent, that euen then, it was not for the <hi>Grecians</hi> sake, that you alone of all the <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otians,</hi> medized not, but because the <hi>Athenians</hi> did not; yet now, you that would do as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did, and contrary to what the <hi>Grecians</hi> did, claime fauour of these, for what you did for the others sake. But there is no reason for that; But as you haue chosen the <hi>Athenians,</hi> so let them helpe you in this tryall. And produce not the Oath of the former League, as if that should saue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> you now; for you haue relinquisht it, and contrary to the same, haue rather helped the <hi>Athenians</hi> to subdue the <hi>Aeginetae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and others, then hindred them from it. And this you not onely did voluntarily, and hauing Lawes, the same you haue now, and none forcing you to it, as there did vs, but also reiected our last inuitation, (a little before the shutting vp of your Citie) to quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and neutrality. Who can therefore more deseruedly bee hated of the <hi>Grecians</hi> in generall, then you, that pretend honesty to their ruine? And those acts wherein formerly, as you say, you haue beene beneficiall to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> you haue now made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be none of yours, and made true proofe of what your owne nature inclines you to. For with <hi>Athenians</hi> you haue walked in the way of iniustice. And thus much wee haue laid open touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our inuoluntary Medizing, and your voluntary Atticizing. And for this last iniury you charge vs with, namely the vnlawfull inuading of your City in time of peace, and of your <hi>New-moone Sacrifice,</hi> we doe not thinke, no not in this action, that wee haue offended so much as you your selues. For though wee had done vniustly, if wee had assaulted your Citie, or wasted your Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory as enemies, of our owne accord, yet when the prime men of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> your owne Citie, both for wealth and Nobility, willing to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge you of forraigne League, and conforme you to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon institutions of all <hi>Boeotia,</hi> did of their owne accord call vs in, wherein lyeth the iniurie then? For they that leade transgresse, rather then they that follow. But as wee conceiue, neither they nor wee haue transgressed at all. But being Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, as well as you, and hauing more to hazzard, they opened their owne Gates, and tooke vs into the Citie as Friends, not as Enemies, with intention to keepe the ill-affected from beeing worse, and to doe right to the good. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Taking vpon them to bee moderators of your Councels, and not to depriue the Citie of your persons: but to reduce
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18271:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you into one body with the rest of your kindred; and not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> you in hostility with any, but to settle you in peace with all. And for an argument, that wee did not this as enemies, wee did harme to no man, but proclaimed, that if any man were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to haue the City gouerned after the common forme of all <hi>Boeotia,</hi> he should come to vs. And you came willingly at first, and were quiet; but afterwards when you knew we were but few, (though we might seeme to haue done somewhat more then was fit to doe, without the consent of your multitude) you did not by vs, as wee did by you, first innouate nothing in fact, and then with words perswade vs to goe forth againe, but contrary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the composition, assaulted vs. And for those men you slew in the affray, we grieue not so much (for they suffered by a kinde of Law) but to kill those that held vp their hands for mercie, whom taken aliue, you afterwards had promised to spare, was not this a horrible cruelty? you committed in this businesse three crimes, one in the necke of another. First the breach of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, then the death that followed, of our men, and thirdly, the falsifying of your promise, to saue them, if we did no hurt to any thing of yours in the Fields. And yet you say that we are the transgressors, and that you for your parts deserue not to vndergo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a iudgement. But it is otherwise. And if these men iudge aright, you shall be punished now for all your crimes at once. We haue herein <hi>men of Lacedaemon,</hi> beene thus large, both for your sakes, and ours. For yours, to let you see, that if you condemne them, it will bee no iniustice; for ours, that the equity of our reuenge may the better appeare. Be not moued with the recitall of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of old (if any they had) which though they ought to helpe the wronged, should double the punishment of such as commit wickednesse, because their offence doth not become them. Nor let them fare euer the better for their lamentation, or your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> when they cry out vpon your Fathers Sepulchers, and their owne want of friends. For we on the other side affirme, that the Youth of our Citie suffered harder measure from them, and their Fathers, partly slaine at <hi>Coronea,</hi> in bringing <hi>Boeotia</hi> to your Confederation, and partly aliue and now old, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their children, make farre iuster supplication to you for reuenge. And pitty belongeth to such as suffer vndeseruedly, but on the contrary, when men are worthily punished, (as these are) it is to bee reioyced at. And for their present want of friends, they may thanke themselues. For of their owne accord they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the better Confederates. And the Law hath beene broken

                        <p>Maintaine therefore <hi>(yee Lacedaemonians)</hi> the Law of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> against these men that haue transgressed it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and giue vnto vs, that haue suffered contrary to the Law, the iust recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of our alacritie in your seruice.

               </note> the fourth or fifth day after the putting ouer of these men into the Iland, arriued the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> Fleet from <hi>Cyllene,</hi> where, since their voyage of <hi>Ionia,</hi> they had lyen at Anchor, to the number of three and fiftie saile. <hi>Alcidas</hi> had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of these, as before, and <hi>Brasidas</hi> came with him as a Counsellour. And hauing first put in at <hi>Sybota,</hi> a Hauen of the Continent, they came on the next morning by breake of day toward <hi>Corcyra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Corcyraeans</hi> being in great tumult and feare, both of the Seditious within, and of the inuasion without, made ready threescore Gallies, and still as any of them were manned, sent them out against the Enemie; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Athenians</hi> had aduised them to giue leaue to them to goe forth first, and then the <hi>Corcyraeans</hi> to follow after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with the whole Fleet together. When their Gallies came forth thus thinne, two of them presently turned to the Enemie, and in others, they that were aboord, were together by the eares amongst themselues, and nothing was done in due order. The <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> seeing their confusion, opposed themselues to the <hi>Corcyraeans</hi> with twenty Gallies onely, the rest they set in array against the twelue Gallies of <hi>Athens,</hi> whereof the <hi>Salaminia</hi> and the <hi>Paralus</hi> were two.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Corcyraeans</hi> hauing come disorderly vp, and by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> few at once, were on their part, in much distresse; but the <hi>Athenians,</hi> fearing the Enemies number, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18271:112"/>
doubting to bee invironed, would neuer come vp to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> charge the Enemie where they stood thicke, nor would set vpon the Gallies that were placed in the middest, but charged one end of them, and drowned one of their Gallies: and when the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> afterwards had put their Fleet into a circular figure, they then went about and about it, endeuouring to put them into disorder; which they that were fighting against the <hi>Corcyraeans</hi> perceiuing, and fearing such another chance as befell them formerly at <hi>Naupactus,</hi> went to their ayde, and vniting themselues, came vpon the <hi>Athenians</hi> all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>But they retyring, rowed a sterne, intending that the <hi>Corcyraeans</hi> should take that time to escape in; they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the meane time going as leasurely backe as was possible, and keeping the enemie still a head. Such was this Battell, and it ended about Sun-set.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Corcyraeans</hi> fearing lest the Enemie in pursuit of their Victorie, should haue come directly against the Citie, or take aboord the men which they had put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer into the Iland, or doe them some other mischiefe, fetcht backe the men into the <hi>Temple of Iuno</hi> againe, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> guarded the City.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> though they had wonne the Battell, yet durst not inuade the Citie, but hauing taken thirteene of the <hi>Corcyraean</hi> Gallies, went backe into the Continent from whence they had set forth. The next day they came not vnto the Citie, no more then before, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was in great tumult and affright: and though also <hi>Brasidas</hi> (as it is reported) aduised <hi>Alcidas</hi> to it,<note place="margin">

            <p>In the mean time the people of <hi>Corcyra,</hi> fearing extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, lest those Gallies should come against the Citie, not onely conferred with those in Sanctuary, and with the rest, about how the Citie might be preserued, but also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced some of them to goe aboard.

The Cities therefore being now in Sedition, and those that fell into it later, hauing heard what had beene done in the former, they farre exceeded the same in newnesse of conceipt, both for the art of assailing, and for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> strangenesse of their reuenges.<note place="margin">The manners of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> The receiued value of names imposed for signification of things, was changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to arbitrary: For inconsiderate boldnesse, was counted true hearted manlinesse; prouident deliberation, a han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some feare; modesty, the cloake of cowardice; to be wise in euery thing, to be lazie in euery thing. A furious sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennesse was reputed a point of valour. To re-aduise for the better security, was held for a faire pretext of tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation.

Hee that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> did insidiate, if it tooke, was a wise man; but hee that could smell out a Trap laid, a more dangerous man then hee: But hee that had beene so prouident, as not to neede to doe the one or the other, was said to bee a dissoluer of society, and one that stood in feare of his aduersary. In briefe, he that could outstrip another in the doing of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill act, or that could perswade another thereto, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer meant it, was commended.

               </note> diuine Law, as by the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of guilt. And what was well aduised of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, they receiued with an eye to their actions, to see whether they were too strong for them, or not, and not ingenuously. To be reuenged was in more request, then neuer to haue receiued iniurie. And for Oathes (when any were) of reconcilement, being administred in the present for necessity, were of force to such as had otherwise no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> power: but vpon opportunity, he that first durst, thought his reuenge sweeter by the trust, then if he had taken the open way. For they did not onely put to account the safenesse of that course, but hauing circumuented their Aduersary by fraud, assumed to themselues withall, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie in point of wit. And dishonest men for the most part are sooner called able, then simple men honest. And men are ashamed of this title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but take a pride in the other.

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other the moderate <hi>Aristocratie,</hi> though in words they seemed to be seruants of the Publique, they made it <hi>in effect</hi> but the Prize of their contention. And striuing by whatsoeuer meanes to ouercome, both ventured on most horrible out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and prosecuted their reuenges still further, without any regard of Iustice, or the publike good, but limiting them, each Faction, by their owne appetite: and stood <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ready, whether by vniust sentence, or with their owne hands, when they should get power, to satisfie their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent spight. So that neither side made account to haue any thing the sooner done for Religion [of an Oath,] but hee was most commended, that could passe a businesse against the haire with a faire Oration. The neutrals of the Citie were destroyed by both Factions; partly because they would not side with them, and partly for enuie that they should so escape.</p>
            <p>Thus was wickednesse on foot in euery kind, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> all <hi>Greece,</hi> by the occasion of their sedition. Sincerity (whereof there is much in a generous nature) was laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18271:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
downe. And it was farre the best course, to stand dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> against each other, with their thoughts in battell array, which no speech was so powerfull, nor Oath terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough to disband. And being all of them, the more they considered, the more desperate of assurance, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contriued how to auoid a mischiefe, then were able to rely on any mans faith. And for the most part, such as had the least wit,<note place="margin">In seditions and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they that distrust their wits, suddenly vse their hands, and defeate the Stratagems of the more subtile sort.</note> had the best successe; for both their owne defect, and the subtilty of their aduersaries, putting them into a great feare to be ouercome in words, or at least in pre-insidiation, by their enemies great craft, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> went roundly to worke with them, with deedes. Whereas the other, not caring though they were percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and thinking they needed not to take by force, what they might doe by plot, were thereby vnprouided, and so the more easily slaine.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Corcyra</hi> then were these euils for the most part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted first; and so were all other, which either such men as haue beene gouerned with pride, rather then modesty, by those on whom they take reuenge, were like to commit in taking it; or which such men as stand vpon their deliuery fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> long pouerty, out of couetousnes (chiefly to haue their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> neighbours goods) would contrary to iustice giue their voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or which men, not for couetousnes, but assailing each other on equall termes, carried away with the vnrulinesse of their anger, would cruelly and inexorably execute.</p>
            <p>And the common course of life being at that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in the Citie; the nature of man, which is wont euen against Law to doe euill, gotten now aboue the Law, shewed it selfe with delight, to be too weake for passion, too strong for iustice, and enemie to all superiority. Else <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they would neuer haue preferred reuenge before inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, nor lucre (whensoeuer the enuie of it was without power to doe them hurt) before iustice. And for the Lawes common to all men in such cases, (which, as long as they be in force, giue hope to all that suffer iniury) men desire not to leaue them standing, against the neede a man in danger may haue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by their reuenges on others, to be beforehand in subuerting them.

We will not be longer in discourse then standeth with our custome, being the <note n="*" place="margin">Breuity of speech was so customary and naturall to the <hi>Laconians,</hi> that it grew to a prouerbe.</note> fashion with vs, where few words suffice, there indeed not to vse many; but yet to vse more, when the occasion requireth that by <hi>words</hi> wee should make plaine that which is to bee done in <hi>actions</hi> of importance. But the words we shall vse, wee pray you to receiue, not with the minde of an Enemie, nor as if wee went about to instruct you, as men ignorant, but for a remembrance to you, of what you know, that you may deliberate wisely therein. It is now in your power to assure your present good fortune <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with reputation, holding what you haue, with the addition of honour and glory besides; and to auoyd that which befalleth men vpon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary successe, who through hope, aspire to greater fortune, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the fortune they haue already, came vnhoped for. Whereas they that haue felt many changes of both fortunes, ought indeed to bee most suspicious of the good. So ought your Citie, and ours especially, vpon experience, in all reason to bee. Know it, by seeing this present mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune falne on vs, who being of greatest dignity of all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> come to you, to aske that, which before wee thought chiefely in our owne hands to giue. And yet wee are not brought to this through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> weakenesse, nor through insolence vpon addition of strength, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it succeeded not with the power wee had, as we thought it should which may as well happen to any other, as to our selues. So that you haue no reason to conceiue, that for your power, and purchases, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune also must be therefore alwaies yours. Such wise men as safely reckon their prosperity in the account of things doubtfull, doe most wisely also addresse themselues towards aduersity; and not thinke that Warre will so farre follow, and no further, as one shall please more or lesse to take it in hand; but rather so farre as fortune shall leade it. Such men also seldome miscarrying, because they bee not puft <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vp with the confidence of successe, choose then principally to giue ouer, when they are in their better fortune. And so it will bee good
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:18271:130"/>
for you, men of <hi>Athens,</hi> to doe with vs; and not, if reiecting our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> aduice, you chance to miscarry (as many wayes you may) to haue it thought hereafter that all your present successes were but meere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                        <p>Whereas, on the contrary, it is in your hands, without danger, to leaue a reputation to posterity both of strength and wisedome. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> call you to a Peace, and end of the Warre, giuing you peace, and alliance, and much other friendship and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all familiarity, requiring for the same, onely those their men that are in the Iland; though also we thinke it better for both sides, not to try the chance of Warre; Whether it fall out that by some occasion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of safety offered, they escape by force, or being expugned by siege, should be more in your power then they be. For wee are of this mind, that great hatred is most safely canceld, not when one that hauing beaten his enemy, and gotten much the better in the Warre, brings him through necessity to take an oath, and to make peace on vnequall termes; but when hauing it in his power, lawfully so to doe, if he please, he ouercome him likewise in goodnesse, and contrary to what he expects, be reconciled to him on moderate conditions. For in this case, his enemy being obliged, not to seeke reuenge, as one that had beene forced, but to requite his goodnesse, will, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> shame, be the more enclined to the conditions agreed on. And na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, to those that relent of their owne accord, men giue way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally, with content; but against the arrogant, they will hazard all, euen when in their owne iudgements they be too weake. But for vs both, if euer it were good to agree, it is surely so at this present, and before any irreparable accident be interposed. Whereby wee should be compelled besides the common, to beare you a particular eternall hatred, and you be depriued of the commodities we now offer you. Let vs be reconciled while matters stand vndecided, and whilst you haue gained reputation, and our friendship, and we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not suffered dishonour, and but indifferent losse. And we shall not onely our selues preferre Peace before Warre, but also giue a ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of their miseries to all the rest of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it rather from you, then vs. For they make Warre, not knowing whether side begun; but if an end be made, (which is now for the most part in your owne hands) the thankes will bee yours.</p>
                        <p>And by decreeing the Peace, you may make the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> your sure friends, in as much as they call you to it, and are therein not forced, but gratified.

For their errours, being in the Wood, and their preparation could not so well haue beene discerned: whereas all the faults of their owne Armie should haue beene in sight. So that the Enemy might haue set vpon them suddenly, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> what part soeuer they had pleased; because the onset had beene in their owne election.

Or doe you thinke perhaps, if any of you possesse a good thing, or bee pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with an euill, that Peace is not better then Warre, to remoue the later, or preserue the former, to both? or that it hath not honours, and eminence more free from danger? or whatsoeuer else one might discourse at large concerning Warre? Which things considered, you ought not to make light of my aduice, but rather make vse of it, euery one to prouide for his owne safety. Now if some man bee strongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited to goe through with some designe of his, be it by right or by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> let him take heed that hee faile not, so much the more to his griefe, as it is contrary to his hope; knowing that many men ere now,

hunting after reuenge on such as had done them iniury, and others <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> trusting by some strength they haue had, to take away anothers right, haue the first sort, in stead of being reuenged, been destroyed, and the other in stead of winning from others, left behind them what they had of their owne. For reuenge succeeds not according to Iustice, as that because an iniury hath beene done, it should therefore prosper, nor is strength therefore sure, because hopefull. It is the instabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Fortune, that is most predominant in things to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which though it be the most deceiueable of all things yet appeares to be the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. For whilest euery one feare it alike, we proceed against each other with the greater prouidence. Now therefore terrified doubly, both with the implicite feare of the incertainty of euents, and with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> terrour of the <hi>Athenians</hi> present, and taking these for hindrances sufficient, to haue made vs come short of what we had seuerally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to effect, let vs send away our enemies that houer ouer vs, and make an eternall peace amongst our selues, or if not that, then a Truce, at least, for as long as may be, and put off our priuate quarrels to some other time. In summe, let vs know this, that following my counsell, we shall euery of vs haue our Cities free, whereby being Masters of our selues, we shall be able to remunerate according to their merit, such as doe vs good or harme. Whereas reiecting it and following the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of others, our contention shall no more be how to be reuenged, or at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the best, if it be, we must be forced to become friends to our greatest enemies, and enemies to such as we ought not. For my part, as I sayd in the beginning, I bring to this the greatest Citie, and which is rather an assaylant then assayled; and yet foreseeing these things, I hold it fit to come to an agreement, and not so to hurt our enemies, as to hurt our selues more.

But I wonder why you shut me forth of

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> your gates and why I was not welcome. For we <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> haue vndergone this great danger, of passing many dayes iournie through the Territory of Strangers, and shewed all possible zeale, be cause we imagined that we went to such Confederates, as before wee came, had vs present in their hearts, and were desirous of our comming. And therefore it were hard, that you should now bee otherwise minded, and withstand your owne, and the rest of the <hi>Grecians</hi> liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; not onely in that your selues resist vs, but also because others whom I goe to, will be the lesse willing to come in; making difficulty, because you to whom I came first, hauing a flourishng City, and being esteemed wise, haue refused vs: For which I shall haue no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> excuse to pleade, but must be thought either to pretend to set vp liberty vniustly, or to come weake, and without power to maintaine you against the <hi>Athenians.</hi> And yet against this same Army I now haue, when I went to encounter the <hi>Athenians</hi> at <hi>Nisaea,</hi> though more in number, they durst not hazzard battell. Nor is it likely that the <hi>Athenians</hi> will send forth so great a number against you, as they had in their Fleet there at <hi>Nisaea.</hi> I come not hither to hurt, but to set free the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and I haue the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> Magistrates bound vnto me by great Oathes, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer Confederates shall be added to their side, at least by mee, shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> still enioy their owne Lawes. And that wee shall not hold you as Confederates to vs, brought in either by force, or fraud, but on the contrary, be Confederates to you, that are kept in seruitude by the <hi>Athenians.</hi> And therefore I clayme not onely that you be not iealous of mee, especially hauing giuen you so good assurance, or thinke me vnable to defend you, but also that you declare your selues boldly with mee. And if any man be vnwilling so to doe, through feare of some particular man, apprehending that I would put the Citie into the hands of a few, let him cast away that feare; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> I came not to side, nor doe I thinke I should bring you an assured li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, if neglecting the ancient vse here, I should enthrall, either the <hi>Multitude,</hi> to the <hi>Few,</hi> or the <hi>Few</hi> to the <hi>Multitude.</hi> For to be gouerned so, were worse then the domination of a Forrainer. And there would result from it to vs <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> not thankes for our labours, but in stead of honour and glory, an imputation of those <note n="*" place="margin">Ambition and desire to subdue other States.</note> crimes, for which we make Warre amongst the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and which would be more odious in vs then in them, that neuer pretended the <note n="*" place="margin">The desire to assert other States.</note> vertue. For it is more dishonourable, at least, to men in dignity, to amplifie their estate by specious fraud, then by open violence.

As for the law which the</hi> Grecians <hi>haue, it is no other, but that they which haue the dominion of any territory, great or small, haue euer the Temples also, &amp; besides the accustomed rites, may superinduce what other they can.

That for the water, they medled with it vpon necessity, which was not to be ascribed to insolence, but to this, that fighting against the</hi> Boeotians <hi>that had inuaded their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory first, they were forced to vse it. For whatsoeuer is forced by War, or danger, hath in reason a kind of pardon, euen with the</hi> god <hi>himselfe.

                        <p>MEN of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> If I did not mistrust, in respect you are thus abandoned by the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> which come vpon you, are many, that you were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> afraid, I should not at this time instruct you, and encourage you as I doe. But now against this desertion of your companions, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of your enemies, I will endeuour with a short instruction and hortatiue, to giue you encouragement to the full. For, to be good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, is vnto you naturall, not by the presence of any Confederates, but by your owne valour; and not to feare others for the number, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are not come from a Citie where the <hi>Many</hi> beare rule ouer the <hi>Few,</hi> but the <hi>Few</hi> ouer <hi>Many,</hi> and haue gotten this for power by no other meanes then by ouercomming in fight. And as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> these <hi>Barbarians,</hi> whom through ignorance you feare, you may take notice both by the former battels, fought by vs against them before, in fauour of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and also by what I my selfe coniecture, and haue heard by others, that they haue no great danger in them. For when any enemy whatsoeuer maketh shew of strength, being indeed weake, the truth once knowne, doth rather serue to embolden the other side, whereas against such as haue va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour indeed, a man will bee the boldest, when hee knoweth the least. These men here, to such as haue not tryed them, doe indeed make terrible offers; for the sight of their number, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fearefull; the greatnesse of their cry intolerable; and the

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vaine shaking of their weapons on high, is not without significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of menacing. But they are not answerable to this, when with such as stand them, they come to blowes. For fighting without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they will quit their place without shame, if they be once pressed, and seeing it is with them, honourable alike to fight, or run away, their valours are neuer called in question. And a battell wherein euery one may doe as he list, affords them a more handsome excuse to saue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. But they trust rather in their standing out of danger, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying vs a farre off, then in comming to hands with vs, for else they would rather haue taken that course then this. And you see manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all that was before terrible in them, is in effect little, and serues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> onely to vrge you to be going, with their shew and noyse. Which if you sustaine at their first comming on, and againe withdraw your selues still, as you shall haue leasure, in your order and places, you shall not onely come the sooner to a place of safety, but shall learne also against hereafter, that such a Rabble as this, to men prepared to endure their first charge, doe but make a flourish of valour, with threats from a farre, before the battell; but to such as giue them ground, they are eagre enough to seeme couragious, where they may doe it safely.</p>

I doe coniecture that it was in contempt of vs, and as not expecting to bee fought withall, that the enemy both came vp to this place, and that they haue now betaken themselues carelesly, and out of order to view the Countrey. But he that best obseruing such errours in his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, shall also, to his strength, giue the onset, not alwayes openly, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in ranged battell, but as is best for his present aduantage, shall for the most part attaine his purpose. And these wiles carry with them the greatest glory of all, by which deceiuing most the enemy, a man doth most benefit his friends. Therefore whilest they are secure without preparation, and intend, for ought I see, to steale away, rather then to stay, I say, in this their loosnesse of resolution, and before they put their minds in order, I for my part, with those I haue chosen, will, if I can, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they get away, fall in vpon the midst of their Army, running.

            <p>Whilest they were yet marching vp, <hi>Agis</hi> the King thought of this course. All Armies doe thus; In the Conflict they extend their right Wing, so as it commeth in vpon the Flanke of the left Wing of the enemy; and this happeneth for that, that euery one through feare seeketh all he can to couer his vnarmed side, with the Shield of him that standeth next him on his right hand, conceiuing, that to be so locked together, is their best defence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hereof, is in the leader of the first File on the right hand, who euer striuing to shift his vnarmed side from the enemy, the rest vpon like feare follow after. And at this time, the <hi>Mantineans</hi> in the right Wing, had farre encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed the <hi>Sciritae</hi>: and the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> on the other side, and the <hi>Tegeates,</hi> were come in, yet farther, vpon the Flanke of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> by as much as they had the greater Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Wherfore <hi>Agis</hi> fearing lest his left Wing should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed, &amp; supposing the <hi>Mantineans</hi> to be come in farre, signified vnto the <hi>Sciritae</hi> and <hi>Brasidians,</hi> to draw out part of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their Bands, and therewith to equalize their left Wing, to the right Wing of the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> and into the void space, he commanded to come vp <hi>Hipponoidas,</hi> and <hi>Aristocles,</hi> two Colonels with their Bands, out of the right Wing, and to fall in there, and make vp the breach: Conceiuing that more then enough would be still remaining in their right Wing, and that the left Wing opposed to the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> would be the stronger. But it happened (for he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it in the very onset, and on the sodaine) both that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles,</hi> and <hi>Hipponoidas</hi> refused to go to the place comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>(for which they were afterwards banished <hi>Sparta,</hi> as thought to haue disobeyed out of cowardise) and that the enemy had in the meane time also charged. And when those which he commanded to goe to the place of the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritae,</hi> went not, they could no more reunite themselues, nor cloze againe the empty space. But the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> haue the disaduantage for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but aduantage of valour.</note> though they had the worst at this time in euery point, for skill, yet in valour they manifestly shewed themselues superior. For after the fight was once begun, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the right Wing of the <hi>Mantineans</hi> did put to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> flight the <hi>Sciritae</hi> &amp; <hi>Brasidians,</hi> and that the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Confederates, and those 1000 chosen men
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:18271:186"/>
of <hi>Argos,</hi> falling vpon them in Flanke, by the breach not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> yet clozed vp, killed many of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and put to flight, and chased them to their Carriages, slaying also certaine of the elder sort, left there for a guard, so as in this part the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were ouercome. But with the rest of the Army, and especially the middle battell, where <hi>Agis</hi> was himselfe, and those which are called, <hi>the</hi> 300 <hi>horsemen,</hi> about him, they charged vpon the eldest of the <hi>Argiues,</hi> and vpon those which are named, <hi>the fiue Cohorts,</hi> and vpon the <hi>Cleonaeans,</hi> and <hi>Orneates,</hi> and certaine <hi>Athenians</hi> aranged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them,<note place="margin">The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> haue the victory.</note> and put them all to flight. In such sort, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> many of them neuer strooke stroake, but as soone as the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> charged, gaue ground presently, and some for feare to be ouertaken, were trodden vnder foot. As soone as the Army of the <hi>Argiues</hi> and their Confederates had in this part giuen ground, they began also to breake, on either side. The right Wing of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geates</hi> had now with their surplusage of number hemmed the <hi>Athenians</hi> in, so as they had the danger on all hands, being within the circle, pend vp; and without it, already vanquished. And they had been the most distressed part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of all the Army had not their horsemen come in to helpe them. Withall it fell out that <hi>Agis</hi> when he perceiued the left Wing of his owne Army to labour, namely, that which was opposed to the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> and to those thousand <hi>Argiues,</hi> commanded the whole Army to goe and relieue the part ouercome. By which meanes the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and such of the <hi>Argiues</hi> as together with them, were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaid whilst the Army passed by and declined them, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themselues at leasure. And the <hi>Mantineans</hi> with their Confederates, and those chosen <hi>Argiues,</hi> had no more mind <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> now of pressing vpon their enemies, but seeing their side was ouercome, and the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> approaching them, presently turned their backs. Of the <hi>Mantineans</hi> the greatest part were slaine, but of those chosen <hi>Argiues,</hi> the most were saued, by reason the flight, and going off, was neither hasty nor long. For the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> fight long and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till they haue made the enemy to turne his backe, but that done, they follow him not farre.</p>

The strongest arguments you vse, are but future hopes, and your present power, is too short to defend you against the forces already aranged against you. You shall therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> take very absurd counsaile, vnlesse excluding vs, you make amongst your selues, some more discreet conclusion; For when you are by your selues, you will no more set your thoughts vpon <hi>shame,</hi> which, when dishonour and danger stand before mens eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the most part vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them.

Which you, if you deliberate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wisely, will take heed of, and not thinke shame to submit to a most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Citie, and that vpon so reasonable conditions, as of League, and of enioying your owne, vnder tribute.

For my owne part, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> I haue honour by it; and for the danger of my person, I esteeme it the least of all men, not but that I thinke him a good member of the Common-wealth, that hath regard also to his owne person and estate: for such a man especially will desire the publike to prosper, for his owne sake. But as I haue neuer spoken heretofore, so nor now will I speake any thing that it against my conscience; for gaining to my selfe a preheminence of honour; but that onely which I apprehend for the best.

But peraduenture when they shall heare that our power is distracted (which is the thing wee now hasten to doe) they will bee glad to ioyne in the Warre with the <hi>Sicilians</hi> against vs, the confederacy of whom they would here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore haue valued aboue many other. It behoueth vs therefore to consider of these things, and not to run into new dangers, when the state of our owne Citie hangeth vnsettled, nor seeke a new dominion, before we assure that which we already haue. For the <hi>Chalcideans</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> after so many yeeres reuolt, are yet vnreduced: and from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> others in diuers parts of the Continent, we haue but doubtfull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But the <hi>Egestaeans,</hi> being forsooth our Confederates, and wronged, they in all haste must be ayded; though to right vs on those by whom we haue a long time our selues beene wronged, that wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre. And yet if we should reduce the <hi>Chalcideans</hi> into subiection, wee could easily also keepe them so. But the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> though wee vanquish them, yet being many, and farre off, wee should haue much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe to hold them in obedience. Now it were madnesse to inuade such, whom conquering, you cannot keepe, and failing, should lose the meanes for euer after to attempt the same againe· As for the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> seemeth vnto me, at least, as things now stand, that they shall bee of lesse danger to vs, if they fall vnder the Dominion of the <hi>Syracusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> then they are now; And yet this is it that the <hi>Egestaeans</hi> would most affright vs with: for now the States of <hi>Sicily</hi> in seuerall, may perhaps be induced, in fauour of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> to take part against vs: whereas then, being reduced into one, it is not likely they would hazard with vs state against state. For by the same meanes that they, ioyning with the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> may pull downe our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, by the same it would bee likely that the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi>

And this <hi>(Athenians)</hi> is your owne case now with the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and their Confederates, whom because beyond your hope you haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, in those things for which at first you feared them, you now in contempt of them, turne your Armes vpon <hi>Sicily.</hi> But we ought not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to be puft vp vpon the misfortunes of our enemies, but to bee confident

Nor ought wee to thinke that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> set their mindes on any thing else, but how they may yet for the late disgrace, repaire their reputation, if they can, by our ouerthrow; and the rather because they haue so much, and so long laboured to win an opinion in the vvorld of their valour. The question with vs therfore (if we be well aduised) will not be of the <hi>Egestaeans</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> but how we may speedily defend our Citie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the insidiation of them that fauour the <hi>Oligarchy.</hi> Wee must remember also that we haue had now some short recreation from a late great Plague, and great Warre, and thereby are improued both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in men and money; which it is most meet we should spend here vpon our selues, and not vpon these Outlawes which seeke for aide. Seeing it maketh for them, to tell vs a specious lye; who contributing onely words, whilest their friends beare all the danger, if they speed well, shal be disobliged of thankes, if ill, vndoe their friends for company.

when they doe iniury, we must maintaine it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> require their assistance, cannot haue it.</hi> And you the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, (if you thinke it your office to take care of the Common-wealth, and desire to be a good member of the same) put these things once more to the question, and let the <hi>Athenians</hi> speake to it againe. Thinke (if you be afraid to infringe the orders of the Assembly) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so many witnesses, it will not be made a crime, but that you shall be rather thought a Physitian of your Country, that hath swallowed down euill councell.

Now, it is no vnprofitable course of life, when a man shall at his priuate cost, not onely benefit himselfe, but also the Common-wealth. Nor doth he that beareth himselfe high vpon his owne worth, and refuseth to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe fellow with the rest, wrong the rest; for if he were in distresse, he should not finde any man that would share with him in his calamity. Therefore, as we are not so much as saluted when we be in misery; so let them likewise be content to be contemned of vs when we flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; or if they require equality, let them also giue it.

For, the number wherewith their Cities are populous, is but of promiscuous Nations, easily shifting, and easily admitting new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers; and consequently not sufficiently armed any of them for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their bodies, nor furnished, as the custome of the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to fight for their Countrey. But what any of them thinkes hee may get by faire speech, or snatch from the Publike by sedition, that onely he lookes after, with purpose if he faile, to runne the Countrey. And it is not likely, that such a rabble, should either with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent giue eare to what is told them, or vnite themselues for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of their affaires in common; but if they heare of faire of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, they will one after one be easily induced to come in; especially, if there be seditions amongst them, as we heare there are. And the truth is, there are neither so many men of Armes as they boast of; nor doth it appeare, that there are so many <hi>Grecians</hi> there in all, as the seuerall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Cities haue euery one reckoned for their owne number. Nay, euen <hi>Greece</hi> hath much belyed it selfe, and was scarce sufficiently ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in all this Warre past. So that the businesse there, for all that I can by Fame vnderstand, is euen as I haue told you, and will yet bee easier. For wee shall haue many of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> vpon hatred of the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> to take our parts against them there, and if wee consider the case aright, there will bee nothing to hinder vs at home. For our Ancestors hauing the same Enemies which they say we leaue behinde vs now in our voyage to <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> besides, did neuerthelesse erect the Empire wee now haue, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> our onely oddes of strength at Sea.</p>
                        <p>And the hope of the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> against vs, was neuer lesse then now it is, though their power were also as great as euer; for they would bee able to inuade our Land, though wee went not into <hi>Sicily;</hi> and by Sea they can doe vs no harme though wee goe, for we shall leaue a Nauie sufficient to oppose theirs, behinde vs. What therefore can wee alleadge with any probability for our backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? or what can wee pretend vnto our Confederates, for denying them assistance? whom wee ought to defend, were it but because wee haue sworne it to them; without obiecting that they haue not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> reciprocally ayded vs. For wee tooke them not into League, that

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they should come hither with their aydes, but that by troubling our enemies there, they might hinder them from comming hither against vs. And the way whereby we, and whosoeuer else hath dominion, hath gotten it, hath euer beene the cheerefull succouring of their associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates that required it, whether they were <hi>Greekes</hi> or <hi>Barbarians.</hi> For if we should all sit still, or stand to make choyce, which were fit to be assisted, and which not, we should haue little vnder our gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the estates of other men, but rather hazzard our owne. For when one is growne mightier then the rest, men vse not onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselues against him, when he shall inuade, but to anticipate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him, that he inuade not at all. Nor is it in our power to be our owne caruers, how much we will haue subiect to vs; but considering the case we are in, it is as necessary for vs to seeke to subdue those that are not vnder our Dominion, as to keepe so, those that are: I est if others be not subiect to vs, we fall in danger of being subiected vnto them. Nor are we to weigh quietnesse in the same ballance that others doe, vnlesse also the institution of this State, were like vnto that of other States. Let vs rather make reckoning by enterprising abroad; to encrease our power at home, and proceed in our voyage; that we may cast downe the haughty conceit of the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> and shew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them the contempt and slight account we make of our present ease, by vndertaking this our expedition in to <hi>Sicily.</hi> Wherby, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering those States, wee shall become masters of all <hi>Greece,</hi> or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> to the benefit of our selues, and our Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.

And thinke not that youth, or age, one without the other, is of any effect, but that the simplest, the middle sort, and the exactest iudgements tempred together, is it that doth the greatest good; and that a State, as well as any other thing, will, if it rest, weare out of it selfe, and all mens knowledge decay; whereas by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Warre, experience will continually increase, and the Citie will get a habit of resisting the enemy, not with words, but action. In summe this is my opinion, that a State accustomed to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> bee actiue, if it once grow idle, will quickely be subiected by the change; and that they of all men are most surely

                           <hi>MEN of Athens,</hi> Forasmuch as I see you violently bent to this Expedition, such effect may it take, as is desired. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse I shall now deliuer my opinion vpon the matter, as it yet standeth. As farre as we vnderstand by report, we set out against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> great Cities, not subiect one to another, nor needing innouation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they should be glad, out of hard seruitude, to admit of easier Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; nor such as are likely to preferre our gouernment before their owne liberty; but many, as for one Iland, and those <hi>Greeke</hi> Cities. For besides <hi>Naxus</hi> and <hi>Catana,</hi> (which two I hope will ioyne with vs, for their affinity with the <hi>Leontines,</hi>) there are other seuen, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in all respects after the manner of our owne Army, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those two, against which wee bend our Forces most, <hi>Selinus,</hi> and <hi>Syracuse.</hi> For there are in them, many men of Armes, many Archers, many Darters, besides many Gallies, and a multitude of men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to man them. They haue also store of money, both amongst priuate men, and in their Temples. This haue the <hi>Selinuntians.</hi> The <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racusians</hi> haue a Tribute beside, comming in from some of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi> But that wherein they exceed vs most, is this, that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in Horses, and haue Corne of their owne, not fetcht in from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. Against such a power, we shall therefore neede, not a Fleet only, and with it a small Army, but there must great Forces goe along of Land-souldiers, if we meane to do any thing worthy our designe, and not to be kept by their many horsemen from landing; especially if the Cities there, terrified by vs should now hold all together, &amp; none but the <hi>Ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staeans</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> proue our friends, &amp; furnish vs with a Cauallery to resist them.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And it would be a shame either to come backe with a repulse, or to send for a new supply afterwards, as if wee had not wisely considered our enterprize at first. Therefore we must goe sufficiently prouided from hence, as knowing that we goe farre from home, and are to make War in a place of disaduantage, and not as when we went as Confederates, to ayde some of our Subiects here at home, where wee had easie bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of necessaries to the Campe, from the Territories of Friends. But we goe farre off, and into a Countrey of none but strangers, and from whence in Winter, there can hardly come a messenger vnto vs in so little as foure moneths. Wherefore I am of opinion, that we ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to take with vs many men of Armes, of our owne, of our Confederates, and of our Subiects, and also out of <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> as many as wee can get, either for loue or money: and also many Archers and Slingers, whereby to resist their Cauallery; and much spare Shipping, for the more easie bringing in of prouision. Also our corne, I meane, Wheate and Barly parched, we must carry with vs from hence in <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p>Aboue all, we must take hence as much money as we can; for as for that which is said to bee ready at <hi>Egesta,</hi> thinke it ready in words, but not in deed: For although wee goe thither with an Army not onely equall vnto theirs, but also, (excepting their men of Armes for Battell) in euery thing exceeding it, yet so shall we scarce be able, both to ouercome them, and withall to preserue our owne. We must also make account, that wee goe to inhabite some City in that forraigne and ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stile Countrey, and either the first day we come thither, to bee presently Masters of the Field, or failing, bee assured to finde all in hostility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vs. Which fearing, and knowing that the businesse requires much good aduice, and more good fortune (which is a hard matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are but men) I would so set forth, as to commit my selfe to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune as little as I may, and take with me an Armie, that in likelihood should be secure.

For they approued his counsell, and thought now there would be no danger at all, and euery one alike fell in loue with the enterprize. The old men, vpon hope to subdue the place they went to, or that at least, so great a power could not miscarry; and the yong men, vpon desire to see a forraigne Countrey, and to gaze, making little doubt but to returne with safety.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>As for the common sort, and the Souldiers, they made account to gaine by it, not onely their wages for the time, but also so to amplifie the State in power, as that their stipend should endure for euer. So that through the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement desire thereunto of the most, they also that liked it not, for feare (if they held vp their hands against it) to be thought euill affected to the State, were content to let it passe.</p>
            <p>And in the end a certaine <hi>Athenian</hi> stood vp, and calling vpon <hi>Nicias,</hi> said, he ought not to shift off, nor delay the businesse any longer, but to declare there before them all,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> what forces he would haue the <hi>Athenians</hi> to decree him. To which, vnwillingly, he answered, and said, hee would consider of it first with his fellow-Commanders; Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, for so much as he could iudge vpon the sudden, he said, there would need no lesse then 100 Gallies; whereof for transporting of men of Armes, so many of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> owne, as they themselues should thinke meet, and the rest to be sent for to their Confederates.

As for Archers, both from hence, and from <hi>Crete,</hi> and Slingers, and whatsoeuer else should seeme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, they would prouide it themselues, and take it with them.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Athenians</hi> had heard him, they presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that the Generals should haue absolute authority, both touching the greatnesse of the preparation, and the whole voyage, to doe therein, as should seeme best vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them for the Common-wealth. And after this, they went

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in hand with the preparation accordingly, and both sent vnto the Confederates, and enrolled Souldiers at home. The City had by this time recouered her selfe from the sicknesse, and from their continuall Warres, both in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men fit for the Warres, growne vp after the ceasing of the Plague, and in store of money gathered together by meanes of the Peace; whereby they made their prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with much ease. And thus were they employed in preparation for the voyage.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the <hi>Mercuries</hi> of Stone,<note place="margin">The faces of all the Images of <hi>Mercury,</hi> throughout <hi>Athens,</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red plaine.</note> throughout <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the whole City of <hi>Athens,</hi> (now there were many of these of square-stone, set vp, by the Law of the place, and many in the porches of priuate houses, &amp; in the Temples) had in one night, most of them their faces pared, and no man knew who had done it. And yet great rewards out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury had been propounded to the discouerers; and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree made that if any man knew of any other profanation, he might boldly declare the same, were he Citizen, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or Bondman. And they tooke the fact exceedingly to heart, as ominous to the expedition, and done withall, vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> conspiracy, for alteration of the State, and dissolution of the <hi>Democracie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon, certaine Strangers dwelling in the City, and certaine Seruing-men, reuealed something, not about the <hi>Mercuries,</hi> but of the paring of the Statues of some other of the <hi>Gods,</hi> committed formerly, through wantonnesse, and too much Wine, by yong men, and withall, how they had in priuate houses, acted the Mysteries of their Religion, in mockery; amongst whom they also accused <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> This, they that most enuyed <hi>Alcibiades,</hi>

                        <p>COncerning the truth of this Inuasion, though perhaps I shall bee thought as well as other men, to deliuer a thing incredible; and though I know that such as bee either the Authors or relaters of matter incredible, shall not onely not perswade, but bee also accounted fooles; neuerthelesse I will not for feare thereof, hold my tongue, as long as the Common wealth is in danger; being confident that I know the truth heereof somewhat more certainely then others doe. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                           <hi>Athenians</hi> are bent to come, euen against vs, (which you verily won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der at) and that vvith great Forces, both for the Sea and Land, vvith pretence indeed to ayde their Confederates, the <hi>Egestaeans,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant the <hi>Leontines,</hi> but in truth they aspire to the dominion of all <hi>Sicily,</hi> and especially of this Citie of ours, vvhich obtained, they make account to get the rest vvith ease. Seeing then they will presently bee vpon vs, aduise vvith your present means, how you may vvith most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour make head against them, that you may not bee taken vnprouided through contempt, nor be carelesse through incredulity; and that such as beleeue it, may not be dismayed with their audaciousnes, and power. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they are not more able to doe hurt vnto vs, then we be vnto them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed is the greatnes of their Fleet without some aduantage vnto vs. Nay it will be much the better for vs, in respect of the rest of the <hi>Sicilians;</hi> for being terrified by them, they will the rather league with vs. And if we either vanquish or repulse them without obtaining what they come for (for I feare not at all the effecting of their purpose) verily it will bee a great honour to vs, and in my opinion not vnlikely to come to passe. For in truth there haue beene few great Fleets, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Grecians</hi> or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> sent far from home, that haue not prospered ill. Neither are these that come against vs, more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> then our selues, and the neighbouring Cities for surely we shall all hold together vpon feare. And if for want of necessaries in a strange Territorie they chance to miscarry, the honour of it will be left to vs against whom they bend their councels, though the greatest cause of their ouerthrow should consist in their owne errours. Which was also the case of these very <hi>Athenians,</hi> who raised themselues by the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of the <hi>Medes,</hi> (though it happened for the most part contrary to reason) because in name they went only against the <hi>Athenians.</hi> And that the same shall now happen vnto vs, is not without probability.</p>
                        <p>Let vs therefore with courage put in readinesse our owne fortes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> let vs send to the <hi>Siculi,</hi> to confirme those we haue, and to make peace and league with others; and let vs send Ambassadors to the rest of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
                           <pb n="370" facs="tcp:18271:206"/>
to shew them that it is a common danger; and into <hi>Italy,</hi> to get <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> them into our League, or at least that they receiue not the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> And in my iudgement, it were our best course to send also to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage;</hi> for euen they are not without expectation of the same danger. Nay, they are in a continuall feare, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> will bring the Warre vpon them also, euen to their Citie. So that vpon apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that if they neglect vs, the trouble will come home to their owne doore, they will perhaps, either secretly, or openly, or some way assist vs. And of all that now are, they are the best able to doe it, if they please. For they haue the most gold and siluer, by which both the Wars, and all things else are the best expedited. Let vs also send to <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to <hi>Corinth,</hi> praying them not onely to send their succours hither with speed, but also to set on foot the Warre there. But that which I thinke the best course of all, though through an habit of sitting still, you will hardly be brought to it, I will neuerthelesse now tell you what it is. If the <hi>Sicilians</hi> all together, or if not all, yet if wee, and most of the rest, would draw together our whole Nauie, and with <hi>2.</hi> moneths prouision goe and meet the <hi>Athenians</hi> at <hi>Tarentum,</hi> and the Promontory of <hi>Iapygia,</hi> and let them see, that they must fight for their passage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the <hi>Ionian</hi> Gulfe, before they fight for <hi>Sicily,</hi> it would both ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them the most, and also put them into a consideration, That we, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the watchmen of our Countrey, come vpon them out of an amicable Territory, (for we shall be receiued at <hi>Tarentum</hi>) whereas they themselues haue a great deale of Sea to passe with all their preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and cannot keepe themselues in their order for the length of the voyage. And that for vs, it will be an easie matter to assaile them, comming vp as they doe, slowly and thinne. Againe, if lightning their Gallies, they shall come vp to vs more nimbly, and more close together, we shall charge vpon them already wearied, or we may, if we please, retire againe into <hi>Tarentum.</hi> Whereas they, if they come ouer but with a part of their prouisions, as to fight at Sea, shall bee driuen into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> want of victuals in those desart parts, and either staying be there besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or attempting to go by, leaue behind them the rest of their prouision, and be deiected, as not assured of the Cities, whether they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them or not. I am therefore of opinion, that dismaid with this reckoning, they will either not put ouer at all from <hi>Corcyra,</hi> or whilest they spend time in deliberating, and in sending out to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore, how many, and in what place wee are, the season will bee lost, and Winter come; or deterred with our vnlooked for opposition, they will giue ouer the Voyage. And the rather, for that (as I heare) the man of most experience amongst their Commanders, hath the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> charge against his will, and would take a light occasion to returne, if

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he saw any considerable stop made by vs, in the way. And I am very sure, we should be voyced amongst them to the vtmost. And as the reports are, so are mens minds; and they feare more such as they beare will begin with them, then such as giue out, that they will no more but defend themselues. Because then they thinke the danger e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall. Which would be now the case of the Athenians. For they come against vs with an opinion that we will not fight; deseruedly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vs, because we ioyned not with the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> to pull them downe. But if they should see vs once bolder then they lookt for, they would be terrified more with the vnexpectednes, then with the truth of our power it selfe. Be perswaded therfore, principally to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> dare to doe this; or if not this, yet speedily to make your selues other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise ready for the War; and euery man to remember, that though to shew contempt of the enemy be best in the heate of fight, yet those preparations are the surest, that are made with feare and opinion of danger. As for the <hi>Athenians,</hi> they come, and I am sure are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the way, and want onely, that they are not now here. <hi>Thus spake</hi> Hermocrates.</p>

            <p>But the people of <hi>Syracuse</hi> were at much strife amongst themselues, some contending, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> would by no meanes come, and that the reports were not true; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that if they came, they would doe no more harme, then they were likely againe to receiue.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                           <p>HE is either a Coward, or not well affected to the State, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he be, that wisheth the <hi>Athenians</hi> not to be so mad, as comming hither, to fall into our power. As for them that report such things as these, and put you into feare, though I wonder not at their boldnesse, yet I wonder at their folly, if they thinke their ends not seene. For they that are afraid of any thing themselues, will put the Citie into affright, that they may shaddow their owne with the Common feare. And this may the reports doe at this time, not raised by chance, but framed on purpose, by such as alwaies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> trouble the State. But if you meane to deliberate wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, make not your reckoning by the reports of these men,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:18271:207"/>
but by that which wise men, and men of great experience, (such as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> I hold the <hi>Athenians</hi> to bee) are likely to doe. For it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that leauing the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> and the Warre there not yet surely ended, they should willingly come hither to a new Warre, no lesse then the former; Seeing, in my opinion, they may bee glad that wee inuade not them, so many, and so great Cities, as wee are. And if indeed they come, (as these men say they will) I thinke <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> more sufficient to dispatch the Warre, then <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> as being in all respects better furnished: and that this our owne Citie, is much stronger then the Armie which they say is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, though it were twice as great as it is. For I know, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> neither bring Horses with them, nor can get any heere, saue onely a few from the <hi>Egestaeans,</hi> nor haue men of Armes, so many as wee, in that they are to bring them by Sea. For it is a hard matter to come so farre as this by Sea, though they carried no men of Armes in their Gallies at all, if they carry with them all other their necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; which cannot be small against so great a Citie. So that I am so far from the opinion of these others, that I thinke the <hi>Athenians,</hi> though they had here another Citie as great as <hi>Syracuse,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining on it, and should from thence make their Warre, yet should not be able to escape from being destroyed euery man of them; much lesse now, when all <hi>Sicily</hi> is their enemie. For in their Campe, fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with their Gallies, they shall be couped vp, and from their Tents, and forced munition, neuer be able to stirre farre abroad, without being cut off by our Horsemen. In short, I thinke they shall neuer be able to get landing; so much aboue theirs do I value our own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But these things, as I said before, the <hi>Athenians</hi> considering, I am very sure, will looke vnto their owne; and our men talke here of things that neither are, nor euer will bee; who I know haue desired, not onely now, but euer, by such reports as these, or by worse, or by their actions, to put the multitude in feare, that they themselues might rule the State. And I am afraid, lest attempting it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> often, they may one day effect it. And for vs, we are too poore-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, either to foresee it ere it be done, or fore-seeing to preuent it. By this meanes our Citie is seldome quiet, but subiect to sedition, and contention not so much against the enemie, as within it selfe; and sometimes also to Tyranny and Vsurpation. Which I will endeuour (if you will second me) so to preuent hereafter, as nothing more of this kinde shall befall you. Which must be done, first by gaining you the Multitude, and then by punishing the Authors of these Plots, not onely when I finde them in the action, (for it will bee hard to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> take them so) but also for those things which they would, and cannot
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:18271:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> doe. For one must not onely take reuenge vpon an Enemie for what he hath already done, but strike him first for his euill purpose; For if a man strike not first, he shall first be strucken. And as for the <hi>Few,</hi> I shall in somewhat reprooue them, in somewhat haue an eye to them, and in somewhat aduise them. For this I thinke will be the best course to auert them from their bad intentions. Tell me, forsooth, (I haue asked this question often) you that are the yonger sort, what would you haue? would you now beare office? the Law allowes it not. And the Law was made, because ye are not now sufficient for gouernment, not to disgrace you when you shall be sufficient. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> forsooth, you would not be ranked with the multitude. But what Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is it, that the same men should not haue the same priuiledges? Some will say, that the <hi>Democracy</hi> is neither a well-gouerned, nor a iust State, and that the most wealthy, are aptest to make the best go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. But I answer first, <hi>Democracy</hi> is a name of the whole; <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> but of a part. Next, though the <hi>Rich</hi> are indeed fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to keepe the <hi>Treasure,</hi> yet the <hi>wise</hi> are the best Counsellors, and the <hi>Multitude,</hi> vpon hearing, the best <hi>Iudge.</hi> Now in a <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy</hi> all these, both ioyntly and seuerally participate equall priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But in the <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> they allow indeed to the <hi>Multitude,</hi> a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> participation of all dangers; but in matters of profit, they not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach vpon the <hi>Multitude,</hi> but take from them, and keepe the whole. Which is the thing that you the <hi>Rich,</hi> and the <hi>Yonger</hi> sort affect, but in a great City cannot possibly embrace. But yet, O ye, the most vnwise of all men, vnlesse you know that what you affect, is euill, and if you know not that, you are the most ignorant of all the <hi>Grecians</hi> I know, or, ye most wicked of all men, if knowing it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you dare doe this: yet I say, informe your selues better, or change your purpose, and help to amplifie the common good of the Citie, making account that the good amongst you, shall not onely haue an equall, but a greater share therin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> then the rest of the multitude. Whereas if you will needes haue all, you shall runne the hazzard of losing all. Away therefore with these rumours, as discouered, and not allowed. For this City, though the <hi>Athenians</hi> come, will be able to defend it selfe with honour. And we haue Generals to looke to that matter. And if they come not, (which I rather beleeue) it will not, vpon the terrour of your reports, make choyce of you for Commanders, and cast it selfe into voluntary serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. But taking direction of it selfe, it both iudgeth your words, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually as facts, and will not vpon words let goe her present liberty, but endeuour to preserue it, by not committing the same actually to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> your discretion. <hi>Thus said</hi> Athenagoras.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a man in the flower of his youth, of great beautie, was in the power of one <hi>Aristogiton,</hi> a Citizen of a middle condition, that was his Louer. This <hi>Harmodius</hi> hauing beene sollicited by <hi>Hipparchus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> and not yeelding, discouered the same vnto <hi>Aristogiton.</hi> Hee apprehending it (as Louers vse) with a great deale of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, and fearing the power of <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> lest hee should take him away by force, fell presently as much as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would permit, to a contriuing how to pull downe the Tyranny.

For neither was the gouernment otherwise heauy till then, but carried without their euill will. And to say the truth, these Tyrants held vertue and wisdome in great account for a long time; and taking of the <hi>Athenians</hi> but a twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part of their reuenues, adorned the Citie, mannaged their Warres, and administred their religion worthily. In other points they were gouerned by the Lawes formerly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> established, saue that these tooke a care euer, to preferre to the Magistracy men of their owne adherence.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> relation then other men. And it may be knowne also by this, It appeares that of all the legitimate brethren, this onely had children, as is both signified by the Altar, and also by that Pillar, which for a testimony of the iniustice of the Tyrants, was erected in the <hi>Athenian</hi> Cittadell. In which there is no mention of any sonne of <hi>Thessalus,</hi> or of <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> but of fiue sonnes of <hi>Hippias,</hi> which he had by <hi>Myrrhine,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Callias the sonne of Hyperochidas.</hi> For it is probable that the eldest was first married, and in the forepart of the Pillar, his name after his fathers, was the first; not without reason, as being both next him in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> age, and hauing also inioyed the Tyranny. Nor indeed could <hi>Hippias</hi> haue easily taken on him the gouernment on a sudden, if his brother had dyed, seazed of the Tyranny, and he been the same day to settle it on himselfe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he retained the same with abundant security, both for the customary feare in the people, and diligence in the Guard; and was not to seeke, like a younger brother, to whom the gouernment had not continually been familiar. But <hi>Hipparchus</hi> came to be named for his mis-fortune, and thereby grew an opinion afterwards, that he was also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Tyrant.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Harmodius</hi> therefore that had denyed his sute, hee disgraced, as he before intended. For when some had war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a sister of his, a Virgin, to be present, to carry a little Basket in a Procession, they reiected her againe when she came, and said, that they had neuer warned her at all, as holding her vnworthy the honour. This was taken hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily by <hi>Harmodius</hi>; but <hi>Aristogiton,</hi> for his sake, was farre more exasperated then he. Whereupon, with the rest of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Conspirators he made all things ready for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the designe. Onely, they were to stay the time of the Holiday, called the great <hi>Panathenaea,</hi> vpon which day onely, such Citizens as lead the Procession, might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suspition be armed in good number. And they were to begin the fact themselues, but the rest were to helpe them against the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>The Guard of</hi> Hippias the Tyrant.</note> Halbardiers.</p>
            <p>Now the Conspirators for their better security, were not many; for they hoped that such also as were not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to it, if they saw it once vndertaken, being vpon this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> occasion, armed, would assist, in the recouery of their owne liberty.

That halfe of the Army which stood foremost, was ordered by eight in File; the other halfe towards their Tents, ordered likewise by eights, was cast into the forme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of a long square, and commanded to obserue diligently, where the rest of the Army was in distresse, and to make specially thither.

               </note> led it presently to the charge. The <hi>Syracusians</hi> expected not to haue fought at that instant, and the Citie being neere, some of them were gone away; and some, for haste, came in running; and though late, yet euery one, as he came, put himselfe in, where was the greatest number. For they wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willingnesse, nor courage, either in this, or any other battell, being no lesse valiant, so farre forth as they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, then the <hi>Athenians.</hi> But the want of this, made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them, euen against their wils, to abate also somewhat of their courage.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse, though they thought not the <hi>Athenians</hi> would haue begun the battell, and were thereby constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fight on a sudden, yet they resumed their Armes, and came presently forward to the encounter.</p>
            <p>And first, the Casters of Stones, and Slingers, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of either side, skirmished in the middest betweene the Armies, mutually chasing each other, as amongst the Light-armed, was not vnlikely.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> After this, the Southsayers brought forth their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices according to the Law of the place, and the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets instigated the men of Armes to the battell.

            <p>After they were come to handstroakes, they fought long on both sides. But in the meane time there hapned some claps of Thunder, and flashes of Lightning, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a great showre of Raine; insomuch as it added to the feare of the <hi>Syracusians</hi> that were now fighting their first battell, and not familiar with the Warres; whereas to the other side that had more experience, the season of the yeere seemed to expound that accident; and their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> feare proceeded from the so-long resistance of their enemies, in that they were not all this while ouercome. When the <hi>Argiues</hi> first, had made the Left Wing of the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> to giue ground, and after them, the <hi>Athenians</hi> also had done the like to those that were arranged against them,<note place="margin">The <hi>Athenians</hi> haue the victory.</note> then the rest of the <hi>Syracusian</hi> Army was presently broken and put to flight.

For euen the <hi>Rhegians,</hi> who are <hi>Chalcideans,</hi> refuse to helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in replanting the <hi>Leontines,</hi> though these also be <hi>Chalcideans.</hi> And then it were a hard case, if they suspecting a bad action vnder a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> faire iustification, are wise without a reason, and you, vpon pretence of

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> reason, should ayde your naturall enemies, and helpe them that most hate you, to destroy your more naturall kindred.</p>
                        <p>But this is no iustice; to fight with them is iustice, and not to stand in feare of their preparation. Which, if wee hold toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not terrible, but is, if contrarily (which they ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour) we bee disvnited. For neither when they came against vs being none but our selues, and had the vpper hand in (Battell, could they yet effect their purpose, but quickly went their wayes. There is no reason therefore wee should bee afraid, when wee are all together, but that wee should haue the better will to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our selues in a League. And the rather, because wee are to haue ayde from <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> who euery way excell these men in Militarie sufficiencie. Nor should you thinke that your purpose to ayde neither, as being in League with both, is either iust in respect of vs, or safe for your selues. For it is not so iust in substance, as it is in the pretence. For if through want of your ayde, the assailed perish, and the assailant become Victor, what doe you by your neutrality, but leaue the safety of the one vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and suffer the other to doe euill? Whereas it were more noble in you, by ioyning with the wronged, and with your kindred, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> both to defend the Common good of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and keepe the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> as your friends, from an act of iniustice. To be short, wee <hi>Syracusians</hi> say, That to demonstrate plainely, to you, or to any other, the thing you already know, is no hard matter; but wee pray you, and withall, if you reiect our words, wee protest, that whereas the <hi>Ionians,</hi> who haue euer beene our enemies, doe take counsell against vs, you that are <hi>Doriens</hi> as well as wee, betray vs. And if they subdue vs, though it bee by your counsels that they doe it, yet they onely shall haue the honour of it. And for the prize of their victory, they will haue none other but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Authors of their victory. But if the victory fall vnto vs, euen you also, the cause of this our danger, shall vndergoe the penalty. Consider therefore now, and take your choice, whether you will haue seruitude without the present danger, or sauing your selues with vs, both auoyd the dishonour of hauing a Master, and escape our enmity, which is likely otherwise to be lasting.</p>

                        <head>THE ORATION OF EVPHEMVS.</head>
                        <p>THough our comming were to renew our former League, yet seeing wee are touched by the <hi>Syracusian,</hi> it will bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary wee speake something heere of the right of our Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the greatest testimonie of this right he hath himselfe giuen, in that he said the <hi>Ionians</hi> were euer enemies to the <hi>Doriens.</hi> And it is true. For being <hi>Ionians,</hi> we haue euer endeuoured to finde out some meanes or other, how best to free our selues from subiection <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> that are <hi>Doriens,</hi> more in number then wee, and dwelling neere vs. After the <hi>Medan</hi> Warre, hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vs a Nauie, wee were deliuered thereby from the command and leading of the <hi>Lacedaemonians;</hi> there beeing no cause why they should rather bee Leaders of vs, then wee of them, saue onely that they were then the stronger. And when wee were made Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of those <hi>Grecians</hi> which before liued vnder the King, vvee tooke vpon vs the gouernment of them, because wee thought, that hauing power in our hands to defend our selues, vve should thereby be the lesse subiect to the <hi>Peloponnesians.</hi> And to say truth, vvee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> subiected the <hi>Ionians</hi> and <hi>Ilanders,</hi> (whom the <hi>Syracusians</hi> say we brought into bondage, being our kindred) not without iust cause: for they came with the <hi>Medes</hi> against ours their Mother Citie, and for feare of losing their wealth, durst not reuolt, as wee did, that aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned our very Citie. But as they were content to serue, so they would haue imposed the same condition vpon vs. For these causes, vvee tooke vpon vs our dominion ouer them, both as worthy of the same, in that wee brought the greatest Fleet, and promptest courage to the seruice of the <hi>Grecians:</hi> whereas they, with the like prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in fauour of the <hi>Medes,</hi> did vs hurt: and also as being desirous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to procure our selues a strength against the <hi>Peloponnesians.</hi> And follow any other wee will not, seeing wee alone haue pulled downe the <hi>Barbarian,</hi> (and therefore haue right to command) or at least haue put our selues into danger more for the liberty of the <hi>Peloponnesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> then of all the rest of <hi>Greece,</hi> and our owne besides. Now to seeke meanes for ones owne preseruation is a thing vnblameable. And as it is for our owne safeties cause that vvee are now heere, so also wee finde that the same will be profitable for you. Which vvee will make plaine, from those very things which they accuse, and you, as most formidable, suspect vs of; being assured, that such as suspect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vvith vehement feare, though they may be wonne for the present with
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:18271:219"/>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the sweetnesse of an Oration, yet vvhen the matter comes to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, will then doe as shall be most for their turne. Wee haue told you that wee hold our Dominion yonder vpon feare; and that vpon the same cause wee come hither now, by the helpe of our friends, to assure the Cities heere, and not to bring you into subiection, but rather to keepe you from it.</p>
                        <p>And let no man obiect, that we be sollicitous for those that are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to vs. For as long as you be preserued, and able to make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> wee shall be the lesse annoyed by their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Forces to the <hi>Peloponnesians.</hi> And in this point you are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> very much vnto vs. For the same reason, it is meete also, that vvee replant the <hi>Leontines,</hi> not to subiect them, as their kindred in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boea,</hi> but to make them as puissant as wee can; that being neere, they may from their owne Territory, weaken the <hi>Syracusians</hi> in our behalfe. For as for our Warres at home, wee are a match for our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, without their helpe. And the <hi>Chalcidean,</hi> (whom hauing made a slaue yonder, the <hi>Syracusian</hi> said, wee absurdly pretend to vindicate into liberty heere) is most beneficiall to vs there, without Armes, paying money onely; but the <hi>Leontines,</hi> and other our friends heere, are the most profitable to vs, when they are most in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> liberty.</p>
                        <p>Now to a Tyrant or Citie that raigneth, nothing can bee thought absurd, if profitable, nor any man a friend, that may not bee trusted to. Friend or Enemy he must bee, according to the seuerall occasions. But here it is for our benefit not to vveaken our friends, but by our friends strength to weaken our enemies. This you must needs beleeue, in as much as yonder also, wee so command ouer our Confederates, as euery of them may bee most vsefull to vs. The <hi>Chians</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymnaeans</hi> redeeme their liberty, with prouiding vs some Gallies: the most of the rest, with a Tribute of money, somewhat more pressing. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Some againe of our Confederates are absolutely free, notwithstanding that they be Ilanders, and easie to be subdued. The reason whereof is this: they are scituate in places commodious about <hi>Peloponnesus.</hi> It is probable therefore, that heere also, we will so order our affaires, as shall be most for our owne turne, and most according to our feare (as we told you) of the <hi>Syracusians.</hi> For they affect a dominion ouer you; and hauing by aduantage of your suspicion of vs, drawne you to their side, will themselues by force, or (if we goe home without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) by your want of friends, haue the sole command of <hi>Sicily.</hi> Which, if you ioyne with them, must of necessity come to passe. For neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> will it be easie for vs to bring so great Forces againe together, nor will the <hi>Syracusians</hi> want strength to subdue you, if we bee absent.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:18271:220"/>
Him that thinketh otherwise, the thing it selfe conuinceth: for when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> you called vs in, to ayde you, at the first, the feare you pretended was onely this, that if we neglected you, the <hi>Syracusians</hi> would subdue you, and we thereby should participate of the danger. And it were vniust, that the argument you would needs haue to preuaile then with vs, should now haue no effect with your selues; or that you should be iealous of the much strength we bring against the power of the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> when much rather you should giue the lesse eare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. We cannot so much as stay here without you; and if becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming perfidious, we should subdue these States, yet we are vnable to hold them, both in respect of the length of the voyage, and for want of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> meanes of guarding them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they be great, and prouided after the manner of the Continent.

This they haue already made to appeare, both in their proceedings against the <hi>Leontines,</hi> and also otherwise. And yet haue these the face to moue you against vs that hinder this, and that haue hitherto kept <hi>Sicily</hi> from falling into their hands. But we on the otherside, inuite you to a farre more reall safety, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> pray you not to betray that safety, which we both of vs hold from one another at this present, but to consider, that they by their owne num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber haue way to you alwayes, though without Confederates, whereas you shall seldome haue so great an ayde againe to resist them. Which if through your iealousie, you suffer to goe away without effect, or if it miscarry, you will hereafter wish for the least part of the same, when their comming can no more doe you good. But <hi>(Camarinaeans)</hi> bee neither you nor others, moued with their calumnies. We haue told you the very truth, why wee are suspected; and summarily wee will tell it you againe, clayming to preuaile with you thereby. We say, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> yonder, lest else we should obey, and we assert into liberty the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties here, lest else we should be harmed by them. Many things vvee are forced to be doing, because many things vve haue to bevvare of. And both novv, and before, vve came not vncalled, but called, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to such of you as suffer vvrong. Make not your selues Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of vvhat vve doe, nor goe about as Censors (vvhich vvere novv hard to doe) to diuert vs; but as farre as this busie humour, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of ours, may be for your ovvne seruice, so farre take, and vse it. And thinke not the same hurtfull alike to all, but that the greatest part of the <hi>Grecians</hi> haue good by it. For in all places, though vve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be not of any side, yet both he that looketh to be wronged, and hee that

Refuse not therefore, the security now present, common both to vs that require it, and to your selues. But doe as others vse to doe; come with vs, and in stead of defending your selues alwayes against the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> take your turne once, and put them to their guard, as they haue done you. <hi>Thus spake</hi> Euphemus.</p>

For which cause, if in applying my selfe afterwards to the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> and <hi>Argiues,</hi> or in any thing else I did you hurt, I did it iustly. And if any man heere were causelesly angry with mee then, when hee suffered, let him bee now content againe, when hee knowes the true cause of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> same. Or if any man thinke the worse of mee for enclining to the <hi>People,</hi> let him acknowledge, that therein also hee is offended without a cause. For wee haue beene alwayes Enemies to Tyrants, and what is contrary to a Tyrant, is called <hi>the People;</hi> and from thence hath continued our adherence to the multitude. Besides, in a City gouerned by <hi>Democracie,</hi> it was necessary in most things to follow the present course; neuerthelesse wee haue endeuoured to bee more moderate, then suteth with the now headstrong humour of the <hi>People.</hi> But others there haue beene, both formerly and now, that haue incited the Common People to worse things then I, and they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> those that haue also driuen out mee. But as for vs, when wee had the charge of the whole, wee thought it reason, by what forme it was growne most great and most free, and in which we receiued it, in the same to preserue it. For though such of vs as haue iudgement, doe know well enough what the <hi>Democracie</hi> is, and I no lesse then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (insomuch as I could inueigh against it; But of confessed mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse nothing can be said that's new) yet wee thought it not safe to change it, when you our Enemies were so neere vs. Thus stands the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter touching my own accusation. And concerning what we are to consult of both you and I, If I know any thing, which your selues doe not, heare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it now. We made this voyage into <hi>Sicily,</hi> first, (if we could) to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the <hi>Sicilians;</hi> after them the <hi>Italians;</hi> after them, to assay the dominion of <hi>Carthage,</hi> &amp; <hi>Carthage</hi> it selfe. If these or most of these enterprizes succceded, then next wee would haue vndertaken <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponnesus,</hi> with the accession both of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Forces there, and with many mercenarie <hi>Barbarians, Iberians,</hi> and others of those parts, confessed to bee the most warlike of the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that are now. We should also haue built many Gallies, besides these which we haue already, (there being plenty of Timber in <hi>Italy</hi>) with the which besieging <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> round, and also taking the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Cities thereof with our Land-forces, vpon such occasions as should arise from the Land, some by assault, and some by siege, wee hoped
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:18271:222"/>
easily to haue debelled it, and afterwards to haue gotten the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of all <hi>Greece.</hi> As for Money and Corne to facilitate some points of this, the places wee should haue conquered there, besides what heere wee should haue found, would sufficiently haue furnished vs.</p>
                           <p>Thus, from one that most exactly knoweth it, you haue heard what is the Designe of the Fleete now gone, and vvhich the Generals there, as farre as they can, vvill also put in execution.</p>
                           <p>Vnderstand next, that vnlesse you ayde them, they yonder cannot possibly hold out. For the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> though inexpert, if many of them vnite, may well subsist; but that the <hi>Syracusians</hi> alone, with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their whole power already beaten, and withall kept from the vse of the Sea, should withstand the Forces of the <hi>Athenians</hi> already there, is a thing impossible. And if their Citie should be taken, all <hi>Sicily</hi> is had, and soone after <hi>Italy</hi> also, and the danger from thence, which I foretold you, would not be long ere it fell vpon you. Let no man therefore thinke, that hee now consulteth of <hi>Sicily</hi> onely, but also of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> vnlesse this bee done with speed. Let the Armie you send bee of such, as being aboord, may row, and landing, presently be armed. And (which I thinke more profitable then the Armie it selfe) send a <hi>Spartan</hi> for Commander, both to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> traine the Souldiers already there, and to compell vnto it such as refuse. For thus will your present friends bee the more encouraged, and such as bee doubtfull, come to you with the more assurance. It were also good to make Warre more openly vpon them heere, that the <hi>Syracusians</hi> seeing your care, may the rather hold out, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> bee lesse able to send supply to their Armie. You ought likewise to fortifie <hi>Decelea</hi> in the Territory of <hi>Athens,</hi> a thing which the <hi>Athenians</hi> themselues most feare, and reckon for the onely euill they haue not yet tasted in this Warre. And the way to hurt an Enemie most, is to know certainely what he most feareth, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to bring the same vpon him. For in reason a man therefore feareth a thing most, as hauing the precisest knowledge of what will most hurt him. As for the commodities which your selues shall reape, and depriue the Enemie of, by so fortifying, letting much passe, I will summe you vp the principall. Whatsoeuer the Territory is furnished withall, will come most of it vnto you, partly taken, and partly of its owne accord. The reuenue of the Siluer Mines in <hi>Laurium,</hi> and whatsoeuer other profit they haue from their Land, or <note n="*" place="margin">As Fees, and Fines, which would cease in the Townes abroad, the Enemy continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lying vpon them, or not be able to be conueyed to the City.</note> from their Courts of Iustice, will presently be lost. And, which is worst, their Confederates will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse in bringing in their reuenue, and will care little for the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> if they beleeue once that you follow the Warre to the vtmost.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> That any of these things be put in act, speedily and earnestly, (Men of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi>) it resteth onely in your selues: for I am confident, and I thinke I erre not, that all these things are possible to bee done. Now I must craue this, that I bee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the worse esteemed, for that hauing once beene thought a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of my Countrey, I goe now amongst the greatest Enemies of the same, against it; nor yet mistrusted, as one that spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with the zeale of a Fugitiue. For though I flye from the malice of them that draue mee out, I shall not (if you take my counsell) fly your profit. Nor are you enemies so much, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> who haue hurt but your enemies, as they are, that haue made enemies of friends. I loue not my Countrey, as wronged by it, but as hauing liued in safety in it. Nor doe I thinke, that I doe heerein goe against any Countrey of mine, but that I farre rather seeke to recouer the Countrey I haue not. And hee is truely a louer of his Countrey, not that refuseth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade the Countrey hee hath wrongfully lost, but that desires so much to bee in it, as by any meanes hee can, hee vvill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to recouer it. I desire you therefore, <hi>(Lacedaemonians)</hi> to make vse of my seruice, in whatsoeuer danger or labour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> seeing you know, (according to the common saying) if I did hurt you much when I was your enemie, I can helpe you much when I am your friend. And so much the more, in that I know the state of <hi>Athens,</hi> and but coniectured at yours. And considering you are now in deliberation vpon a matter of so extreme importance, I pray you thinke not much to send an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie both into <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Attica,</hi> as well to preserue the great matters that are there, with the presence of a small part of your Force, as also to pull downe the power of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> both present and to come; and afterwards to dwell in safety your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> selues, and to haue the leading of all <hi>Greece;</hi> not forced, but vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and with their good affection.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>ATHENIANS,</hi> You know by many other my Letters, what hath passed formerly: nor is it lesse needfull for you to bee informed of the state we are in, and to take counsell vpon it at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> this present. When we had in many Battels beaten the <hi>Syracusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> against whom we were sent, and had built the Walles within which we now lye, came <hi>Gylippus</hi> a <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> with an Armie out of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> and also out of some of the Cities of <hi>Sicily;</hi> and in the first Battell was ouercome by vs; but in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, forced by his many Horsemen and Darters, we retired vvithin our Workes. Whereupon giuing ouer our vvalling vp of the Citie, for the multitude of our enemies, we now sit still. Nor can vve indeed haue the vse of our vvhole Army, because some part of the men of Armes are employed to defend our Walles. And they haue built a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Wall vp to vs, so that now vve haue no more meanes to encloze it, except one should come with a great Army, and vvinne that crosse-wall of theirs by assault. And so it is, that wee vvho seemed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege others, are besieged our selues, for so much as concerneth the Land. For wee cannot goe farre abroad by reason of their Cauallery. They haue also sent Ambassadours for another Armie into <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesus;</hi> and <hi>Gylippus</hi> is gone amongst the Cities of <hi>Sicily,</hi> both to sollicite such to ioyne with him in the Warre, as haue not yet stirred; and of others to get, if he can, both more Land-souldiers, and more munition for their Nauie. For they intend (as I haue beene informed) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> both to assault our Wall by Land with their Armie, and to make tryall what they are able to doe with their Nauy by Sea. For though our Fleet (vvhich they also haue heard) were vigorous at first, both for soundnesse of the Gallies, and entirenesse of the men; yet our Gallies are now soaked, with lying so long in the water, and our men consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For vve vvant the meanes to hale aland our Gallies, and trim them, because the Gallies of the Enemie, as good as ours, and more in number, doe keepe vs in a continuall expectation of assault, which they manifestly endeuour. And seeing it is in their owne choice to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or not, they haue therefore liberty to dry their Gallies at their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> pleasure. For they lye not, as we, in attendance vpon others. Nay, vve could hardly doe it, though we had many Gallies spare, and vvere not

            <p>After this the <hi>Syracusians</hi> sent out twelue Gallies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of <hi>Agatharchus</hi> a <hi>Syracusian.</hi> Of which one carried Ambassadours into <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> to declare what hope they had now of their businesse, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigate them to a sharper Warre in <hi>Attica.</hi> The other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuen went into <hi>Italy,</hi> vpon intelligence of certaine Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels laden with commodities comming to the <hi>Athenians</hi> Army: which also they met with, and destroyed most of them; and the Timber which for building of Gallies, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>Athenians</hi> had ready framed, they burned in the Territory of <hi>Caulonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this they went to <hi>Locri,</hi> and riding heere, there came vnto them one of the Ships that carried the men of Armes of the <hi>Thespians</hi>; whom the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord, &amp; went homeward by the Coast. The <hi>Athenians</hi> that watched for them with 20 Gallies at <hi>Megara,</hi> tooke one of them, and the men that were in her, but could not take the rest: So that they escaped through to <hi>Syracuse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was also a light Skirmish in the Hauen of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>Syracuse,</hi> about the Piles which the <hi>Syracusians</hi> had driuen downe before their old Harbour, to the end that the Gallies might ride within, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> not annoy them by assault. The <hi>Athenians</hi> hauing brought to the place a Ship of huge greatnesse, fortified with Woodden Turrets, and couered against Fire, caused certaine men with little Boats, to goe and fasten Cords vnto the Piles, and so broke them vp with craning. Some also the Diuers did cut vp with Sawes. In the meane time the <hi>Syracusians</hi> from the Harbour, and they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> from the great Ship, shot at each other, till in the

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> end, the greatest part of the Piles were by the <hi>Athenians</hi> gotten vp. But the greatest difficulty was to get vp those Piles which lay hidden; for some of them they had so driuen in, as that they came not aboue the Water. So that hee that should come neere, was in danger to bee throwne vpon them as vpon a Rocke. But these also for reward the Diuers went downe, and sawed asunder. But the <hi>Syracusians</hi> continually draue down other in their stead. Other deuices they had against each other, (as was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely betweene Armies so neere opposed) and many light <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Skirmishes passed, and attempts of all kindes were put in execution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Syracusians</hi> moreouer sent Ambassadours, some <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> some <hi>Ambraciotes,</hi> and some <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> vnto the Cities about them, to let them know, that they had wonne <hi>Plemmyrium,</hi> and that in the Battell by Sea, they were not ouercome by the strength of the Enemie, but by their own disorder; and also to shew what hope they were in, in other respects, and to intreat their ayd both of Sea and Land-forces, forsomuch as the <hi>Athenians</hi> expecting another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Army, if they would send ayde before it came, whereby to ouerthrow that which they had now there, the Warre would be at an end.

And that fighting a-head, which seemed before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to be want of skill in the Masters [to doe otherwise,] was it they would now principally make vse of; for in this would bee their principall aduantage. For the <hi>Athenians,</hi> if ouercome, would haue no retiring, but to the Land, which was but a little way off, and little in compasse, neere their owne Campe, and of the rest of the Hauen themselues should be Masters, and the Enemie being prest, could not choose, thronging together into a little roome, and all into one &amp; the same place, but disorder one another, (which was indeed the thing that in all their battells by Sea, did the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi>

The <hi>Syracusians</hi> hauing deuised thus much ouer and aboue their former skill and strength, and far more confident now since the former Battell by Sea, assaulted them both with their Army and with their Nauy at once. The Landmen from the City <hi>Gylippus</hi> drew sooner out a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> little, and brought them to the Wall of the <hi>Athenians</hi> Campe, vpon the side towards the Citie; and from <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieum,</hi> the men of Armes, all that were there, and the Horsemen and light-armed of the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> came vp to the Wall on the other side.

Others againe went aboord, and withall came to ayde those ashore; but when the Gallies were manned, they put off, being 75. in number,<note place="margin">The <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> fight.</note> and those of <hi>Syracuse</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 80.

The next day the <hi>Syracusians</hi> lay still, without shewing any signe of what they meant to doe.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> spent a whole day from morning vntill night.</p>

               <note place="margin">The stratagem of <hi>Ariston,</hi> a Master of a Gally.</note> a <hi>Corinthian,</hi> the most expert Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster that the <hi>Syracusians</hi> had in their Fleet, perswaded the Commanders of the Nauie, to send to such in the Citie as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it belonged to, and command that the Market should bee speedily kept at the Sea-side, and to compell euery man to bring thither whatsoeuer hee had fit for meate, and there to sell it, that the Mariners disbarking, might presently dine by the Gallies sides, and quickly againe vnlooked-for, assault the <hi>Athenians</hi> afresh the same day.</p>
            <p>This aduice being liked, they sent a Messenger, and the Market was furnished.

The <hi>Athenians</hi> supposing they had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> retired towards the Citie, as vanquished, landed at leasure, and amongst other businesse, went about the dressing of their dinner, as not expecting to haue fought againe the same day. But the <hi>Syracusians</hi> suddenly going aboord, came towards them againe. And the <hi>Athenians</hi> in great tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, and for the most part vndined, imbarking disorderly, at length with much adoe went out to meete them. For a while they held their hands on both sides, and but obserued each other; But anon after, the <hi>Athenians</hi> thought not fit by longer dallying, to ouercome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with their owne labour, but rather to fight as soone as they could; and thereupon at once with a ioynt shout, charged the Enemie, and the fight began. The <hi>Syracusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> receiued and resisted their charge; and fighting, as they had before determined, with their Gallies head to head with those of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and prouided with beakes for the purpose, brake the Gallies of the <hi>Athenians</hi> very much, between the heads of the Gallies and the oares. The <hi>Athenians</hi> were also annoyed much by the Darters from the Deckes, but much more by those <hi>Syracusians,</hi> who going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in small Boats, passed vnder the rowes of the Oares

            <p>The <hi>Syracusians</hi> hauing fought in this manner with the vtmost of their strength, in the end gat the victory, and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> betweene the two <hi>Ships,</hi> escaped into their harbour.

            <p>After this, <hi>Demosthenes</hi> thought good to try the Wall,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which the <hi>Athenians</hi> had built to enclose the City withall, with Engines, but seeing the Engines were burnt by the Defendants fighting from the Wall, and that hauing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted it in diuers parts with the rest of his army, he was, notwithstanding put backe, he resolued to spend the time no longer, but (hauing gotten the consent of <hi>Nicias,</hi> and the rest in Commission, thereunto) to put in execution his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe for <hi>Epipolae,</hi> as was before intended.

And others going on, in their first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> course tooke the Crosse-wall of the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> they flying that kept it, and were throwing downe the Battlements thereof. The <hi>Syracusians</hi> and their Confederates, and <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus,</hi> and those with him, came out to meet them, from their Campes, but because the attempt was vnexpected, and in the night, they charged the <hi>Athenians</hi> timorously, and were euen at first forced to retire. But as the <hi>Athenians</hi> aduanced more out of order, chiefly as hauing already got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the victory, but desiring also, quickly to passe through all that remained yet vnfoughten with, (lest through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their remissenesse in following, they might againe rally themselues,) the <hi>Boeotians</hi> withstood them first, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, forced them to turne their backs. And here the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> were mightily in disorder, and perplexed, so that it hath been very hard to be informed of any side, in what manner each thing passed. For if in the day time, when things are better seene, yet they that are present cannot tell how all things goe, saue onely what euery man with much adoe seeth neere vnto himselfe: How then in a battell by night, (the onely one that hapned betweene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> great Armies in all this Warre) can a man know any thing for certaine? For though the Moone shined bright, yet they saw one another no otherwise then (as by Moone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was likely) so as to see a body, but not be sure whether it were a friend, or not. And the men of Armes on both sides being not a few in number, had but little ground to turne in. Of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> some were already ouercome, others went on in their first way. Also a great part of the rest of the Army was already, part got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vp, and part ascending, and knew not which way to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> march; For after the <hi>Athenians</hi> once turned their backes, all before them was in confusion; and it was hard to
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:18271:243"/>
distinguish of any thing for the noyse. For the <hi>Syracusians</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and their Confederates preuailing, encouraged each other, and receiued the assailants with exceeding great shouts, (for they had no other meanes in the night to expresse themselues.) And the <hi>Athenians</hi> sought each other, and tooke for Enemies all before them, though friends, and of the number of those that fled. And by often asking the <hi>Word,</hi> there being no other meanes of distinction, all as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at once, they both made a great deale of stirre amongst themselues, and reuealed the <hi>Word</hi> to the Enemie.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> because these, beeing victorious, and vndistracted, knew one another better. So that when they lighted on any number of the Enemie, though they themselues were more, yet the Enemy escaped, as knowing the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word; but they, when they could not answer, were slaine.

For we are brought to a necessity now, of making it a Land-fight vpon the Water; and it will be the best for vs, neither to fall backe our selues, nor to suffer the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to doe so. Especially, when, except what our men on Land shall make good, the shore is altogether hostile. Which you remembring, must therefore fight it out to the vtmost, and not suffer your selues to bee beaten backe vnto the shore. But when Gallie to Gallie shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> once be falne close, neuer thinke any cause worthy to make you part, vnlesse you haue first beaten off the men of Armes of the Enemy, from their Deckes. And this I speake to you rather, that are the men of Armes, than to the Mariners, in as much as that part belongeth rather vnto you that fight aboue; and in you it lyeth, euen yet to atchieue the Victory for the most part with the Land-men. Now for the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, I aduise, and withall beseech them, not to bee too much daunted with the losses past, hauing now, both a greater number of Gallies, and greater Forces vpon the Deckes. Thinke it a pleasure worth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing, that being taken, by your knowledge of the language, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of our fashions for <hi>Athenians,</hi> (though you be not so) you are not only admired for it through all <hi>Greece,</hi> but also partake of our domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in matter of profit, no lesse then our selues; and for awfulnesse to the Nations subiect, and protection from iniury, more. You therefore that alone participate freely of our Dominion, cannot with any iustice betray the same. In despight therefore of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whom you haue often vanquished, and of the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> who, as long as our Fleet was at the best, durst neuer so much as stand vs, repell them, and make it appeare, that your knowledge, euen with weaknesse and losse, is better then the strength of another, with Fortune. Againe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to such of you as are <hi>Athenians,</hi> I must remember this, that you haue no more such Fleets in your Harbours, nor such able men of Armes, and that if ought happen to you but victory, your Enemies here will presently bee vpon you at home; and those at home will bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to defend themselues, both against those that shall goe hence, and against the Enemy that lyeth there already.

After this cruell battell, and many Gallies and men on either side consumed, the <hi>Syracusians</hi> and their Confederates hauing the victory, tooke vp the wrecke, and bodies of their dead, and returning into the City, erected a Trophy. But the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> in respect of the greatnesse of their present losse, neuer thought vpon asking leaue to take vp their dead or wreck, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but fell immediately to consultation how to bee gone the same night. And <hi>Demosthenes</hi> comming vnto <hi>Nicias,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his opinion, for going once againe aboard, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the passage, if it were possible, betimes the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; saying that their Gallies which were yet remaining, and seruiceable, were more then those of the Enemy. (for the <hi>Athenians</hi> had yet left them about 60, and the <hi>Syracusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> vnder 50.) But when <hi>Nicias</hi> approued the aduice, and would haue manned out the Gallies, the Mariners refused to goe aboord, as being not onely deiected with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but also without opinion of euer hauing the vpper hand any more. Whereupon they now resolued all, to make their retreat by Land.<note place="margin">The stratagem of <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crates,</hi> to hinder the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape of the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
               </note> But <hi>Hermocrates</hi> of <hi>Syracuse</hi> suspecting their purpose, and apprehending it as a matter dangerous, that so great an Army going away by Land, and sitting downe in some part or other of <hi>Sicily,</hi> should there renue the War, repayred vnto the Magistrates, and admonished them, that it was not fit through negligence, to suffer the Enemy in the night time to goe their wayes, (alledging what he thought best to the purpose) but that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> all the <hi>Syracusians</hi> and their Confederates should goe out and fortifie in their way, and prepossesse all the narrow

passages with a guard. Now they were all of them of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> same opinion, no lesse then himselfe, and thought it fit to be done, but they conceaued withall, that the Souldier now ioyfull, and taking his ease after a sore battell, being also ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liday, (for it was their day of sacrifice to <hi>Hercules</hi>) would not easily be brought to obey. For through excesse of ioy for the victory, they would most of them, being holiday, be drinking, and looke for any thing, rather then to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at this time to take Armes againe, and goe out. But seeing the Magistrates vpon this consideration thought it hard to be done, <hi>Hermocrates</hi> not preuailing, of his own head <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> contriued this. Fearing lest the <hi>Athenians</hi> should passe the worst of their way in the night, and so at ease out-goe them, as soone as it grew darke, he sent certaine of his friends, and with them certaine Horsemen, to the <hi>Athenian</hi> Campe, who approaching so neere as to be heard speake, called to some of them to come forth, as if they had beene friends of the <hi>Athenians</hi> (for <hi>Nicias</hi> had some within that vsed to giue him intelligence) and bade them to aduise <hi>Nicias</hi> not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge that night, for that the <hi>Syracusians</hi> had beset the waies, but that the next day, hauing had the leasure to furnish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their Armie, they might march away. Vpon this aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement they abode that night, supposing it had beene without fraud. And afterwards, because they went not presently, they thought good to stay there that day also; to the end that the Souldiers might packe vp their necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as commodiously as they could, and be gone, leauing all things else behind them, saue what was necessary for their bodies.<note place="margin">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> It was a lamentable departure, not onely for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as that they marched away with the losse of their whole Fleet, &amp; that in stead of their great hopes, they had endangered both themselues and the State, but also for the dolorous obiects, which were presented both to the eye and minde of euery of them in particular, in the leauing of their Campe. For their dead lying vnburyed, when any one saw his friend on the ground, it strooke him at once, both with feare and griefe. But the liuing that were sicke or wounded, both grieued them more then the dead, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> were more miserable. For with intreaties and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they put them to a stand, pleading to bee taken along by whomsoeuer they saw of their fellowes or familiars, and hanging on the neckes of their Camerades, and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing as farre as they were able. And when the strength of their bodies failed, that they could goe no further, with Ay-mees and imprecations, were there left. Insomuch as the whole Armie filled with teares, and irresolute, could hardly get away, though the place were hostile, and they had suffered already, and feared to suffer in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> more then with teares could bee expressed, but hung downe their heads, and generally blamed themselues. For they seemed nothing else, but euen the people of some great City expugned by siege, and making their escape. For the whole number that marched, were no lesse, one with another, then 40000. men. Of which, not onely the ordinary sort carried euery one what he thought he should haue occasion to vse; but also the men of Armes &amp; Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, contrary to their custome, carried their victuals vnder their Armes, partly for want, &amp; partly for distrust of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> seruants, who from time to time ran ouer to the enemy; but at this time went the greatest number: and yet what they carried, was not enough to serue the turne. For not a iot more prouision was left remaining in the Campe. Neither were the sufferings of others, and that equal diuision of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, which neuerthelesse is wont to lighten it, in that we suffer with many, at this time so much as thought light in it selfe. And the rather, because they considered from what splendor and glory which they enioyed before, into how low an estate they were now falne: For neuer <hi>Grecian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> so differed from it selfe. For whereas they came with a purpose to enslaue others, they departed in greater feare of
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:18271:253" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being made slaues themselues, and in stead of Prayers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and Hymnes, with which they put to Sea, they went backe againe with the contrary maledictions; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they came out Sea-men, they departed Land-men, and relyed not vpon their Nauall forces, but vpon their men of Armes. Neuerthelesse, in respect of the great danger yet hanging ouer them, these miseries seemed all but tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Nicias</hi> perceiuing the Armie to be deiected, and the great change that was in it, came vp to the Rankes, and encouraged and comforted them, as far as for the present meanes he was able. And as he went from part to part,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he exalted his voyce more then euer before, both as being earnest in his exhortation, and because also he desired that the benefit or his words might reach as farre as might be.</p>

Euen I my selfe, that haue the aduantage of none of you in strength of body, (you see how I am in my sicknesse) nor am thought inferiour to any of you for prosperity past, either in respect of mine owne priuate person, or otherwise, am neuerthelesse now in as much danger as the meanest of you. And yet I haue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the Gods frequently acording to the Law, and liued iustly and vnblamably towards men. For which cause, my hope is still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the future, though these calamities, as being not according to the measure of our desert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe indeed make me feare. But they may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> perhaps cease. For both the Enemies haue already had sufficient fortune, and the Gods if any of them haue beene displeased with our Voyage, haue already sufficiently punished vs. Others haue inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their neighbours as well as wee, and as their offence, which proceeded of humane infirmity, so their punishment also hath beene tolerable. And we haue reason now, both to hope for more fauour from the Gods, (for our case deserueth their pitty rather then their hatred) and also not to despaire of our selues, seeing how good and how many men of Armes you are, marching together in order of Battell.

But the <hi>Syracusian</hi> Horsemen lay still vpon them, and their Light-armed plyed them with their Darts in the flanke.

               <pb n="462" facs="tcp:18271:254"/>
in the meane time got before them, and cut off <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their passage with a wall. This was at a steepe Hill, on either side wherof was the Channel of a torrent with steep and rocky banks, and it is called <hi>Acraeum Lepas.</hi> The next day the <hi>Athenians</hi> went on. And the Horsemen and Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> and their Confederates, being a great number of both, pressed them so with their Horses and Darts, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> after long fight, were compelled to retire againe into the same Campe: But now with lesse victuall then before, because the Horsemen would suffer them no more to straggle abroad. In the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they dislodged, and put themselues on their march againe, and forced their way to the Hill which the Enemy had fortified, where they found before them, the <hi>Syracusian</hi> Foot embattelled in great length aboue the Fortification, on the Hils side (for the place it selfe was but narrow.) The <hi>Athenians,</hi> comming vp assaulted the Wall, but the shot of the Enemy, who were many, and the steep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Hill (for they could easily cast home from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue) making them vnable to take it, they retired againe and rested. There hapned withall some claps of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and a showre of Raine, as vsually falleth out at this time of the yeere, being now neere <hi>Autumne,</hi> which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disheartened the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who thought that also this did tend to their destruction.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> seeing the miserable estate of their Army, and the want

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> already of all necessaries, and that many of their men, in many assaults of the Enemy were wounded, to lead away the Army as farre as they possible could, not the way they purposed before, but toward the Sea, which was the contrary way to that which the <hi>Syracusians</hi> guarded.

When they had made many fires accordingly, they marched in the night, and (as vsually it falleth out in all Armies, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> most of all in the greatest, to be subiect to affright and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, especially marching by night, and in hostile ground, and the enemy neere) were in confusion. The Army of <hi>Nicias</hi> leading the way, kept together and got farre afore, but that of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> which was the greater halfe, was both seuered from the rest, and marched more disorderly. Neuerthelesse, by the morning betimes they got to the Sea side, and entring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the <hi>Helorine</hi> way, they went on towards the Riuer <hi>Cacyparis,</hi> to the end when they came thither to march vpwards along the Riuers side, through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the heart of the Countrey. For they hoped that this way, the <hi>Siculi</hi> to whom they had sent, would meet them. When they came to the Riuer, here also they found a certaine guard of the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> stopping their passage with a Wall, and with Pyles. When they had quickly forced this guard, they passed the Riuer, and againe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on, to another Riuer called <hi>Erineus,</hi> for that was the way which the Guides directed them. In the meane time the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> and their Confederates, as soone as day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and that they knew the <hi>Athenians</hi> were gone, most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of them accusing <hi>Gylippus,</hi> as if he had let them go with his consent, followed them with speed the same way, which they easily vnderstood they were gone, and about dinner time ouertooke them.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Demosthenes</hi> ouertaken by the enemy, resisteth as long as he can, and is taken.</note> When they were come vp to those with <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> who were the hindmost, and had marched more slowly and disorderly then the other part had done, as hauing been put into disorder in the night, they fell vpon them, and fought. And the <hi>Syracusian</hi> Horsemen hemmed them in, and forced them vp into a narrow compasse, the more easily now, because they were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> diuided from the rest. Now the Army of <hi>Nicias</hi> was gone by this time 150 Furlongs further on. For he led
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:18271:255"/>
away the faster, because he thought not that their safety <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> consisted in staying and fighting voluntarily, but rather in a speedy retreat, and then onely fighting when they could not choose. But <hi>Demosthenes</hi> was both in greater, and in more continuall toyle, in respect that he marched in the Reere, and consequently was pressed by the Enemy. And seeing the <hi>Syracusians</hi> pursuing him, he went not on, but put his men into order to fight, till by his stay he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed, and reduced, he and the <hi>Athenians</hi> with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great disorder. For being shut vp, within a place en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed round with a Wall, and which on either side had a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> way open, amongst abundance of Oliue trees, they were charged from all sides at once with the Enemies shot. For the <hi>Syracusians</hi> assaulted them in this kind, and not in close battell, vpon very good reason. For to hazzard bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell against men desperate, was not so much for theirs, as for the <hi>Athenians</hi> aduantage. Besides, after so manifest suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, they spared themselues somewhat, because they were loth to weare themselues out before the end of the businesse, and thought by this kind of fight, to subdue and take them aliue. Whereupon, after they had plyed the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>Athenians</hi> &amp; their Confederates, all day long from euery side with shot, and saw that with their wounds, and other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance, they were already tired; <hi>Gylippus,</hi> and the <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> and their Confederates, first made Proclamation, that if any of the Ilanders would come ouer to them, they should be at liberty; And the men of some few Cities went ouer. And by and by after they made agreement with all the rest, that were with <hi>Demosthenes, That they should deliuer vp their Armes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>and none of them be put to death, neither violently, nor by bonds, nor by want of the necessities of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> life.</hi> And they all yeelded, to the number of 6000 men, and the siluer they had, they laid it all downe, casting it into the hollow of Targets, and filled with the same, foure Targets. And these men, they carried presently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Citie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicias</hi> and those that were with him attained the same day to the Riuer <hi>Erineus,</hi> which passing, he caused his Armie to sit downe vpon a certaine ground more eleuate then the rest; where the <hi>Syracusians</hi> the next day ouertooke and told him, That those with <hi>Demosthenes</hi> had yeelded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> themselues, and willed him, to do the like.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> beleeuing it, tooke Truce for a Horseman to enquire the truth.

And that till payment of the money were made, he would deliuer them Hostages, <hi>Athenians,</hi> euery Hostage rated at a Talent. But <hi>Gylippus</hi> and the <hi>Syracusians</hi> refusing the condition, charged them, and hauing hemmed them in, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> plyed them with shot, as they had done the other Army, from euery side, till euening. This part of the Armie was also pinched with the want both of victuall and other necessaries. Neuerthelesse obseruing the quiet of the night, they were about to march. But no sooner tooke they their Armes vp, then the <hi>Syracusians</hi> perceiuing it, gaue the Alarme. Whereupon the <hi>Athenians</hi> finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues discouered, sate downe againe; all but 300, who breaking by force through the guards, marched as farre as they could that night. And <hi>Nicias</hi> when it was day, led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his Army forward, the <hi>Syracusians</hi> and their Confederates still pressing them in the same manner, shooting and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at them from euery side. The <hi>Athenians</hi> hasted to get the Riuer <hi>Asinarus,</hi> not onely because they were vrged on euery side by the assault of the many Horsemen, and other multitude, and thought to be more at ease when they were ouer the Riuer, but out of wearinesse also, and desire to drinke. When they were come vnto the Riuer, they rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in without any order, euery man striuing who should first get ouer. But the pressing of the Enemy, made the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> passage now more difficult. For being forced to take the Riuer in heaps, they fell vpon and trampled one another vnder their feet; and falling amongst the Speares, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensiles of the Armie, some perished presently, and others catching hold one of another, were carried away together downe the streame. And not only the <hi>Syracusians</hi> standing along the farther banke being a steepe one, killed the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> with their shot from aboue, as they were many of them greedily drinking, and troubling one another in the hollow of the Riuer, but the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> came also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and slew them with their Swords, and those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially that were in the Riuer. And suddenly the
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:18271:256"/>
water was corrupted. Neuerthelesse they drunke it, foule <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as it was, with blood and mire, and many also fought for it. In the end, when many dead lay heaped in the Riuer, and the Armie was vtterly defeated, part at the Riuer, and part (if any gat away) by the Horsemen, <hi>Nicias</hi> yeelded himselfe vnto <hi>Gylippus,</hi> (hauing more confidence in him then in the <hi>Syracusians) To be for his owne person at the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him and the</hi> Lacedaemonians, <hi>and no further slaughter to be made of the Souldiers. Gylippus</hi> from thenceforth comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take prisoners. So the residue, except such as were hidden from them (which were many) they carried aliue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> into the Citie. They sent also to pursue the 300. which brake through their guards in the night, and tooke them. That which was left together of this Armie, to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, was not much; but they that were conueyed away by stealth were very many: and all <hi>Sicily</hi> was filled with them, because they were not taken, as those with <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes</hi> were, by composition. Besides, a great part of these were slaine; for the slaughter at this time was exceeding great, none greater in all the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Warre. They were also not a few that dyed in those other assaults in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> March. Neuerthelesse many also escaped, some then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and some by running away after seruitude, the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez-uous of whom was <hi>Catana.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Syracusians</hi> and their Confederates, being come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, returned with their prisoners, all they could get, and with the spoile, into the Citie.

For these, or for causes neere vnto these, was hee put to death, being the man that of all the <hi>Grecians</hi> of my time, had least deserued to be brought to so great a degree of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> As for those in the Quarries, the <hi>Syracusians</hi> handled them at first but vngently. For in this hollow place, first the Sunne and suffocating ayre (being without roofe) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed them one way: and on the other side, the nights comming vpon that heate, autumnall and cold, put them, by reason of the alteration, into strange diseases.

Also the smell was intollerable, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> besides that they were afflicted with hunger and thirst.

they went from thence into the Gulfe of <hi>Iäsus,</hi> to learne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> how the affaires of the <hi>Milesians</hi> stood. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> comming a horsebacke to <hi>Teichiussa,</hi> of the Territory of <hi>Miletus,</hi> in which part of the Gulfe the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> Gallies lay at Anchor, they were informed by him of the Battell; for <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was with the <hi>Milesians,</hi> and with <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in it. And he exhorted them (vnlesse they meant to lose what they had in <hi>Ionia,</hi> and the whole businesse) to succour <hi>Miletus</hi> with all speed, and not to suffer it to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in with a Wall.

Seeing that since their late losses, it hath scarce beene fit, with their strongest preparation, willingly, no nor vrged by precedent necessity, to vndertake, how then without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint to seeke out voluntary dangers? Therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them with all speede to take aboord those that were wounded, and their Land men, and whatsoeuer V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensiles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they brought with them but to leaue behind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they had taken in the territory of the Enemy, to the end that their Gallies might be the lighter, and to put off for <hi>Samos,</hi> and thence, when they had all their Fleete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to make out against the Enemy, as occasion should be offered.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> from <hi>Abydus</hi> to <hi>Dardanus,</hi> fourescore and sixe Gallies. In the right Wing of the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> were the <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>; in the other, <hi>Mindarus</hi> himselfe, and those Gallies that were nimblest.

            <p>Now the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> laboured to giue the first on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, and with their left Wing to ouer-reach the right Wing of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and keepe them from going <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> out, and to driue those in the middle, to the shore which was neere. The <hi>Athenians,</hi> who perceiued it, where the Enemy went about to cut off their way out, put foorth the same way that they did, and out-went them.</p>

               <hi>Cynos-sema,</hi> by meanes whereof that part of the Fleet which was in the middest, became both weake and diuided, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when theirs was the lesse Fleet; and the sharpe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and angular figure of the place about <hi>Cymos-sema</hi> tooke away the sight of what passed there, from those that were on the other side.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> therefore charging this middle part, both draue their Gallies to the dry Land, and beeing farre superiour in fight, went out after them, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted them vpon the shore. And to helpe them, neither was <hi>Thrasibulus</hi> able, who was in the right Wing, for the multitude of the Enemies that pressed him; nor <hi>Thrasyllus</hi> in the left Wing, both because hee could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not see what was done for the Promontory of <hi>Cynos-sema,</hi> and because also hee was kept from it by the <hi>Syracusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and others, lying vpon his hands, no fewer in number then themselues. Till at last the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> bold vpon their victory, chasing some one Gally, some another, fell into some disorder, in a part of their Armie. And then those about <hi>Thrasybulus,</hi> hauing obserued that the opposite Gallies sought now no more to go beyond them, turned vpon them, and fighting, put them presently to flight. And hauing also cut off from the rest of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Fleet, such Gallies of the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> of that part

The <hi>Syracusians</hi> also, whom those about <hi>Thrasyllus</hi> had already caused to shrinke, when they saw the rest fly, fled out-right.</p>

            <p>When they had set vp a Trophie in the Promontory of <hi>Cynos-sema,</hi> and taken vp the wreckes, and giuen truce to the Enemies to fecth away the bodies of their dead, they presently sent away a Gally with a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to carry newes of the Victory to <hi>Athens.</hi> The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> vpon the comming in of this Gally, hearing of their vnexpected good fortune, were encouraged much, after their losse in <hi>Euboea,</hi> and after their sedition, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that their estate might yet keepe vp, if they ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the businesse couragiously.</p>
