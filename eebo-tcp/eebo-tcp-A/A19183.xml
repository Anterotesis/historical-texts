            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>I Tell you true Sir, but to euery man</l>
               <l>I would not be so lauish of my speech,</l>

               <l>And too much sweetnes glutted hath your tast,</l>
               <l>And makes you loath them: At the first</l>
               <l>You did admire her beautie, praisde her face,</l>
               <l>Were proud to haue her follow at your heeles</l>
               <l>Through the broad streetes, when all censuring tongues</l>
               <l>

Found themselues busied as she past along,</l>

               <l>Haue you not in the time of your first loue,</l>
               <l>Hugd such new popular and vulgar talke,</l>
               <l>And glorified still to see her brauely deckt?</l>
               <l>But now a kind of loathing hath quite changde</l>
               <l>Your shape of loue into a forme of hate,</l>

               <l>My reason is my mind, my ground my wil,</l>

               <l>Is she not loyall, constant, louing, chast,</l>
               <l>Obedient, apt to please, loth to displease,</l>

               <l>What fooles they are that seem most wise in loue,</l>
               <l>How wise they are, that are but fooles in loue:</l>
               <l>Before I was a Louer, I had reason</l>
               <l>To iudge of matters, censure of all sorts,</l>
               <l>Nay I had wit to call a Louer foole,</l>
               <l>And looke into his folly with bright eyes,</l>

               <l>By his good counsell, from that course of sinne:</l>
               <l>And like a Christian, seeing them astray</l>
               <l>In the broad path that to damnation leades,</l>

               <l>Before hand lets prepare our selues to laugh,</l>
               <l>A Ieast is nothing if it be not grac'd:</l>

               <l>I came vnto a Puritant to wooe her,</l>
               <l>And roughly did salute her with a kisse:</l>
               <l>Away quoth she, and rudely pusht mefro her,</l>
               <l>Brother, by yea and nay I like not this,</l>
               <l>And still with amorous talke she was saluted,</l>

               <l>And courted her, and spake her wondrous faire,</l>
               <l>But euer somewhat did offend her sight,</l>
               <l>Either my double ruffe, or my long hayre:</l>
               <l>My skarfe was vain, my garments hung too low,</l>
               <l>My Spanish shooe was cut too broad at toe.</l>

Seeming to be conformd in looke and speech,</l>
               <l>My shooes were sharpe toed, and my band was plaine,</l>
               <l>Close to my thigh my metamorphis'd breech:</l>
               <l>My cloake was narrow Capte, my haire cut shorter,</l>

Pardon me M. <hi>Arthur,</hi> I will now</l>

               <l>Your modest wife with words <hi>I</hi> tempted oft,</l>

               <l>Would winne her to attend to my request:</l>
               <l>Nay after death I lou'd her, in so much</l>
               <l>That to the vault where she was buried,</l>
               <l>My constant loue did lead me thorow the darke,</l>
               <l>There readie to haue tane my last farewell,</l>
               <l>The parting kisse I gaue her I felt warme,</l>
               <l>Briefly, <hi>I</hi> bare her to my mothers house,</l>
               <l>Where she hath since liu'd the most chast &amp; true,</l>

               <l>That haue tried both, in wealth and miserie.</l>
               <l>A good wife will be carefull of her fame,</l>
               <l>Her husbands credit, and her owne good name:</l>

               <l>Neuer keep home, but alwaies be a gadding:</l>
               <l>And such art thou. A good wife will conceale</l>

               <l>That may procure him harme, and such art thou.</l>
               <l>But a bad wife corrupts chast wedlocks vow.</l>
               <l>On this hand vertue, and on this hand sinne,</l>
               <l>This who would striue to loose, or this to winne?</l>
               <l>Here liues perpetuall ioy, here burning woe,</l>

Seeke vertuous wiues, all husbands will be blest,</l>

               <l>They that my fortunes will pervse, shall finde</l>
               <l>No beauties like the beautie of the minde.</l>
