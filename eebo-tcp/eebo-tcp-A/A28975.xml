            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

EXPERIMENTS AND CONSIDERATIONS Touching COLOURS.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving in convenient pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, mention'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that induc'd me to write it, and the Scope I propos'd to my ſelf in it, I think it ſuperfluous to entertain the Reader now, with what he will meet with hereafter. And I ſhould judge it needleſs, to trouble others, or my ſelf, with any thing of Preface: were it not that I can ſcarce doubt, but this Book will fall into the hands of ſome Readers, who being unacquainted with the difficulty of attempts of this nature, will think it strange that I ſhould publiſh any thing about Colours, without a particular The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of them. But I dare expect that Intelligent and Equitable Readers will conſider on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half: That the profeſſed Deſign of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe is to deliver things rather <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> than
<pb facs="tcp:56394:3"/>
                     <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> and conſequently if I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded divers new <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Conſiderations and hints, which perhaps may afford no deſpicable Aſſiſtance towards the framing of a ſolid and comprehenſive Hypotheſis, I have done at least as much as I promis'd, or as the nature of my Undertaking exacted. But another thing there is, which if it ſhould be objected, I fear I ſhould not be able ſo eaſily to anſwer it, and that is; That in the following Treatiſe (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Third part of it) the Experiments might have been better Marſhall'd, and ſome of them deliver'd in fewer words. For I muſt confeſs that this Eſſay was written to a private Friend, and that too, by ſnatches, at ſeveral times, and places, and (after my manner) in looſe ſheets, of which I oftentimes had not all by me that I had already written, when I was writing more, ſo that it needs be no wonder if all the Experiments be not rang'd to the beſt Advantage, and if ſome connections and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of them might eaſily have been mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Eſpecially ſince having careleſly laid by the looſe Papers, for ſeveral years after they were written, when I came to put them together to diſpatch them to the Preſs, I found ſome of thoſe I reckon'd upon, to be very unſeaſonably wanting. And to make any great change in the order of the reſt, was more than the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters importunity, and that, of my own avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avocations
<pb facs="tcp:56394:3"/>
(and perhaps alſo conſiderabler ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations) would permit. But though ſome few preambles of the particular Experiments might have (perchance) been ſpar'd, or ſhorten'd, if I had had all my Papers under my View at once; Yet in the moſt of thoſe Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory paſſages, the Reader will (I hope) find hints, or Advertiſements, as well as Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If I ſometimes ſeem to inſist long upon the circumstances of a Tryall, I hope I ſhall be eaſily excuſed by thoſe that both know, how nice divers experiments of Colours are, and conſider, that I was not barely to <hi>relate</hi> them, but ſo as to teach a young Gentleman to make them. And if I was not ſollicitous, to make a nicer diviſion of the whole Treatiſe, than into three parts, whereof the One contains ſome Conſiderations about Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in general. The Other exhibits a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of an Account of particular Colours, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifi'd in whiteneſs and Blackneſs. And the Third promiſcuous Experiments about the remaining Colours (eſpecially Red) in order to a Theory of them. If, I ſay, I contented my ſelf with this eaſie Diviſion of my Diſcourſe, it was perhaps becauſe I did not think it ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be Curious about the Method or Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of a Treatiſe, wherein I do not pretend to preſent my Reader with a compleat Fabrick, or ſo much as Modell; but only to bring in Materials proper for the Building; And if I
<pb facs="tcp:56394:4"/>
did not well know how Ingenious the Curioſity and Civility of Friends makes them, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men by ſpecious allegations, to gratifie their deſires; I ſhould have been made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve by perſons very well qualify'd to judge of matters of this nature, that the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments will not need the addition of accurate Method and ſpeculative Notions to procure Acceptance for the Treatiſe that contains them: For it hath been repreſented, That in most of them, as the Novelly will make them ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and the Quickneſs of performance, keep them from being tedious; ſo the ſenſible chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that are effected by them, are ſo manifest, ſo great, and ſo ſudden, that ſcarce any will be diſpleaſed to ſee them, and thoſe that are any thing Curious will ſcarce be able to ſee them, without finding themſelves excited, to make Reflexions upon Them. But though with me, who love to meaſure Phyfical things by their <hi>uſe,</hi> not their <hi>ſtrangeneſs,</hi> or <hi>prettineſs,</hi> the partiality of others prevails not to make me over value theſe, or look upon them in themſelves as other than Trifles: Yet I confeſs, that ever ſince I did divers years ago ſhew ſome of them to a Learned Company of <hi>Virtuoſi:</hi> ſo many perſons of differing Conditions, and ev'n Sexes, have been Curious to ſee them, and pleas'd not to Diſlike them, that I cannot Deſpair, but that by complying with thoſe that urge the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
<pb facs="tcp:56394:4"/>
of them, I may both gratifie and excite the Curious, and lay perhaps a Foundation whereon either others or my ſelf may in time ſuperſtruct a ſubſtantial Theory of Colours. And if <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> after his Maſter <hi>Plato,</hi> have rightly obſerv'd Admiration to be the <hi>Parent of Philoſophy,</hi> the wonder, ſome of theſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles have been wont to produce in all ſorts of Beholders, and the acceſs they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gain'd ev'n to the Cloſets of Ladies, ſeem to promiſe, that ſince the ſubject is ſo pleaſing, that the Speculation appears as Delightfull as Difficult, ſuch eaſie and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Experiments, which require but little time, or charge, or trouble in the making, and when made are ſenſible and ſurprizing enough, may contribute more than others, (far more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant but as much more difficult) to recommend thoſe parts of Learning (Chymistry and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcular Philoſophy) by which they have been produc'd, and to which they give Teſtimony ev'n to ſuch kind of perſons, as value a pretty Trick more than a true Notion, and would ſcarce admit Philoſophy, if it approach'd them in another Dreſs: without the ſtrangeneſs or endearments of pleaſantneſs to recommend it. I know that I do but ill conſult my own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the conſenting to the Publication of the following Treatiſe: For thoſe things, which, whilſt men knew not how they were perform'd,
<pb facs="tcp:56394:5"/>
appear'd ſo ſtrange, will, when the way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them, and the Grounds on which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd them, ſhall be Publick, quickly loſe all that their <hi>being Rarityes,</hi> and their <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought Myſteries,</hi> contributed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them. But 'tis fitter for Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancks than Naturalis to deſire to have their diſcoverys rather admir'd than underſtood, and for my part I had much rather deſerve the thanks of the Ingenious, than enjoy the Applauſe of the Ignorant. And if I can ſo farr contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the diſcovery of the nature of Colours, as to help the Curious to it, I ſhall have reach'd my End, and ſav'd my ſelf ſome Labour which elſe I may chance be tempted to undergo in proſecuting that ſubject, and adding to this Treatiſe, which I therefore call a <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it chiefly contains matters of fact, and which Hiſtory the Title declares me to look upon but as <hi>Begun:</hi> Becauſe though that above a hundred, not to ſay a hundred and fifty Experiments, (ſome looſe, and others inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven amongſt the diſcourſes them ſelves) may ſuffice to give a <hi>Beginning</hi> to a History not hitherto, that I know, begun by any; yet the ſubject is ſo fruitfull, and ſo worthy, that thoſe that are Curious of theſe Matters will be farr more wanting to themſelves than I can ſuſpect, if what I now publiſh prove any more than a <hi>Beginning.</hi> For, as I hope my End avours
<pb facs="tcp:56394:5"/>
may afford them ſome aſſistance towards this work, ſo thoſe Endeavours aremuch too Vnfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd to give them any diſcouragement, as if there were little left for others to do towards the History of Colours.</p>
                  <p>For (firſt) I have been willing to leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd the <hi>moſt part</hi> of thoſe Phaenomena of Colours, that Nature preſents us of her own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, (that is, without being guided or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruld by man) ſuch as the different Colours that ſeveral ſorts of Fruites paſs through before they are perfectly ripe, and thoſe that appear upon the fading of flowers and leaves, and the putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (and its ſeveral degrees) of fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a thouſand other obvious Instances of the changes of colours. Nor have I <hi>much</hi> medled with thoſe familiar Phaenomena wherein man is not an Idle ſpectator; ſuch as the Greenneſs produc'd by ſalt in Beef much powder'd, and the Redneſs produc'd in the ſhells of Lobſters upon the boyling of thoſe fiſles; For I was willing to leave the <hi>gathering</hi> of <hi>Obſervations</hi> to thoſe that have not the Opportunity to <hi>make Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And for the ſame Reaſons, among others, I did purpoſly omit the Lucriferous practiſe of Trades-men about colours; as the ways of making Pigments, of Bleanching wax, of dying Scarlet, &amp;c. though to divers of them I be not a stranger, and of ſome I have myſelf made Tryall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:56394:6"/>
Next; I did purpoſely paſs by divers Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of other Writers that I had made Tryall of (and that not without regiſtring ſome of their Events) unleſs I could ſome way or other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, becauſe I wanted leaſure to inſert them, and had thoughts of proſecuting the work once begun of laying together thoſe I had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by themſelves in caſe of my not being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by others diligence. So that there remains not a little, among the things that are already publiſhed, to imploy thoſe that have a mind to exerciſe themſelves in repeating and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining them. And I will not undertake, that <hi>none</hi> of the things deliver'd, ev'n in this Treatiſe, though never ſo faithfully ſet down, may not prove to be thus farr of this Sort, as to afford the Curious ſomewhat to add about them. For I remember that I have ſomewhere in the Book itſelf acknowledged, that having written it by ſnatches, partly in the Countrey, and partly at unſeaſonable times of the year, when the want of fit Instruments, and of a competent variety of flowers, ſalts, Pigments, and other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials made me leave ſome of the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, (eſpecialy thoſe about Emphatical Colours) far more unfiniſhd than they ſhould have been, if it had been as eaſie for me to <hi>ſupply</hi> what was wanting to compleat them, as to <hi>diſcern.</hi> Thirdly to avoyd diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the young Gentleman I call Pyrophilus, whom
<pb facs="tcp:56394:6"/>
the leſs Familiar, and more Laborious ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Chymistry would probably have frighted, I purpoſely declin'd in what I writ to him, the ſetting down any Number of ſuch Chymicall Experiments, as, by being very ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate or tedious, would either require much skill, or exerciſe his patience. And yet that this ſort of Experiments is exceedingly Numerous, and might more than a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the Hiſtory of Colours, thoſe that are vers'd in Chymical proceſſes, will, I preſume, eaſily allow me.</p>
                  <p>And (Laſtly) for as much as I have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion more than once in my ſeveral Writings to treat either porpoſely or incidentally of matters relating to Colours; I did not, perhaps, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my ſelf oblig'd, to deliver in one Treatiſe <hi>all</hi> that I would ſay concerning that ſubject.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude, by ſumming up what I would ſay concerning what I <hi>have</hi> and what I <hi>have not</hi> done, in the following Papers; I ſhall not <hi>(on the one ſide)</hi> deny, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that I pretended not to write an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Treatiſe of Colours, but an Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Eſſay to acquaint a private firiend with what then occurrd to me of the things I had thought or try'd concerning them; I might preſume I did enough for once, if I did clearly and faithfully ſet down, though not <hi>all</hi> the Experiments I could, yet at least ſuch a

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is preſented to thy view one of the Abſtruſeſt as well as the Gentileſt Subjects of Natural Philoſophy, the <hi>Experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Hiſtory of Colours;</hi> which though the Noble Author be pleaſed to think but <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,</hi> yet I muſt take leave to ſay, that I think it ſo well begun, that the work is more than half diſpatcht. Concerning which I cannot but give this advertiſement to the Reader, that I have heard the Author expreſs himſelf, that it would not ſurpriſe him, if it ſhould happen to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that ſome of theſe Experiments have been already publiſhed, partly by Chymiſts, and partly by two or three very freſh Writers upon other Subjects. And though the number of theſe Experiments be but very ſmall, and though they be none of the conſiderableſt, yet it may on this occaſion be further repreſented, that it is eaſie for our Author to name ſeveral men, (of whoſe number I can truly name my
<pb facs="tcp:56394:8"/>
ſelf) who remember either their having ſeen him make, or their having read, his Accounts of the Experiments delivered in the following Tract ſeveral years ſince, and long before the publication of the Books, wherein they are mentioned. Nay in divers paſſages (where he could do it without any great inconvenience) he hath ſtruck out Experiments, which he had tryed many years ago, becauſe he ſince found them divulged by perſons from whom he had not the leaſt hint of them; which yet is not touched, with deſign to reflect upon any Ingenious Man, as if he were a Plagiary: For, though our Generous Author were not reſerved enough in ſhewing his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments to thoſe that expreſſed a Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to ſee them (amongſt whom a very Learned Man hath been pleaſed publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to acknowledge it ſeveral years ago <note n="*" place="margin">He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this kind and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that according to this doctrine may much help the Theory of colours, and particularly the force both of Sulphureous and volatile, as likewiſe of Alcalizate and Acid Salts, and in what particulars, Colours likely depend not in their cauſation from any Salt at all, may beg his information from M. <hi>Boyle,</hi> who hath ſome while ſince honoured me with the ſight of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers concerning this ſubject, containing many excellent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, made by him for the Elucidation of this doctrine, &amp;c. Dr. <hi>R.

<pb facs="tcp:56394:8"/>
another. And eſpecially Chymical Labora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories may many times afford the ſame <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon</hi> about Colours to ſeveral perſons at the ſame or differing times. And as for the few <hi>Phaenomena</hi> mentioned in the ſame Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical writers, as well as in the following Treatiſe, our Author hath given an account, why he did not decline rejecting them, in the Anotations upon the 47<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Experiment of the third part. Not here to mention, what he elſewhere ſaith, to ſhew what uſe may be Juſtifiably made of Eperiments not of his own deviſing by a writer of Natural Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if, what he employes of others mens, be well examined or verified by himſelf.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, this Treatiſe is ſuch, that there needs no other invitation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe it, but that tis compoſed by one of the Deepeſt &amp; Moſt indefatigable ſearchers of Nature, which, I think the World, as far as I know it, affords. For mine own part, I feel a ſecret Joy within me, to ſee ſuch beginings upon ſuch <hi>Themes,</hi> it being demonſtratively true, <hi>Mota facilius moveri,</hi> which cauſeth me to entertain ſtrong hopes, that this Illuſtrious <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> and Reſtleſs Inquirer into Nature's Secrets will not ſtop here, but go on and proſper in the Diſquiſition of the other principal Colours, <hi>Green, Red,</hi> and <hi>Yellow.</hi> The Reaſoning faculty ſet

once a ſloat, will be carried on, and that with eaſe, eſpecially, when the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof meet, as they do here, with ſo greedy an Entertainment at home and a broad. I am confident, that the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY,</hi> lately conſtituted by his <hi>MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY for improving Natural knowledge,</hi> will Judge it their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to exhort our Author to the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Argument, conſidering, how much it is their deſign and buſineſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulate a good ſtock of ſuch accurate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and Experiments, as may afford them and their Offpring genuine Matter to raiſe a Maſculine Philoſophy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the Mind of Man may be enobled with the Knowledge of ſolid Truths, and the Life of Man benefited with ampler accommodations, than it hath been hitherto.</p>
                  <p>Our Great Author, one of the Pillars of that Illuſtrious Corporation, is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhing large <hi>Symbola</hi>'s to this work, and is now falln, as you ſee, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo comprehenſive and important a theme, as will, if inſiſted on and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, prove one of the conſiderableſt peeces of that ſtructure. To which, if he ſhall pleaſe to add his Treatiſe of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Flame,</hi> as he is ready to publiſh his

Experimental Accounts of <hi>Cold,</hi> I eſteem, the World will be obliged to Him for having ſhewed them both the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Left Hand</hi> of Nature, and the Operations thereof.</p>
                  <p>The conſidering Reader will by this very Treatiſe ſee abundant cauſe to ſollicit the Author for more; ſure I am, that of whatever of the Productions of his Ingeny comes into <hi>Forein parts</hi> (where I am hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the acquaintance of many intelligent friends) is highly valued; And to my knowledge, there are thoſe among the French, that have lately begun to learn Engliſh, on purpoſe to enable themſelves to read his Books, being impatient of their Traduction into Latin. If I durſt ſay all, I know of the Elogies received by me from abroad concerning Him, I ſhould perhaps make this Preamble too prolix, and certainly offend the modeſty of our Author.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I ſhall leave this, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with deſiring the Reader, that if he meet with other faults beſides thoſe, that the Errata take notice of (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he may) he will pleaſe to conſider both the weakneſs of the Authors eyes, for not reviewing, and the manifold Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations

                     <p>CHAP. I. <hi>THe Author ſhews the Reaſon, first of his Writing on this Subject (1.) Next of his preſent manner of Handling it, and why he partly declines a Methodical way (2.) and why he has partly made uſe of it in the Hiſtory of</hi> Whiteneſs <hi>and</hi> Blackneſs. (3.)</p>
                     <p>Chap. 2. <hi>Some general Conſiderations are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, firſt of the Inſignificancy of the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Colours in many Bodies (4, 5.) and the Importance of it in others (5.) as particularly in the Tempering of Steel (6, 7, 8.) The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why other particular Inſtances are in that place omitted (9.) A neceſſary diſtinction about Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour premis'd (10, 11.) That Colour is not Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Object (11.) prov'd first by the Phantaſms of Colours to</hi> Dreaming <hi>men, and</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks; <hi>Secondly by the ſenſation or apparition of Light upon a Blow given the Eye or the Diſtemper
<pb facs="tcp:56394:11"/>
of the Brain from internal Vapours (12.). The Author recites a particular Instance in himſelf; another that hapn'd to an Excellent Perſon related to him (13.) and a third told him by an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Phyſician (14, 15.) Thirdly, from the change of Colours made by the Senſory Diſaffected (15, 16.) Some Inſtances of this are related by the Author, obſerv'd in himſelf (16, 17.) others told him by a Lady of known Veracity (18.) And others told him by a very Eminent Man (19.) But the ſtrange Inſtances afforded by ſuch as are Bit by the</hi> Tarantula <hi>are omitted, as more properly deliver'd in another place.</hi> (20.)</p>
                     <p>Chap. 3. <hi>That the Colour of Bodies depends chiefly on the diſpoſition of the Superficial parts, and partly upon the Variety of the Texture of the Object (21.) The former of theſe are confirm'd by ſeveral Perſons (22.) and two Inſtances, the first of the Steel mention'd before, the ſecond of melted Lead (23, 24.) of which laſt ſeveral Obſervables are noted (25.) A third Inſtance is added of the Porouſneſs of the appearing ſmooth Surface of Cork (26, 27.) And that the ſame kind of Porouſneſs may be alſo in the other Colour'd Bodies; And of what kind of Figures, the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial reflecting Particles of them may be (28.) and of what Bulks, and cloſeneſs of Poſition (29.) How much theſe may conduce to the Generation of Colour inſtanc'd in the Whiteneſs of Froth, and in the mixtures of Dry colour'd Powders (30.) A further explication of the Variety that may be in the Superficial parts of Colour'd Bodies, that may cauſe that Effect, by an example drawn from the Surface of the Earth (31.) An Apology for
<pb facs="tcp:56394:11"/>
that groſs Compariſon (32.) That the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the Superficial aſperities may be Varied from the poſition of the Eye, and ſeveral Inſtances given of ſuch appearances (33, 34, 35.) That the appearance of the Superficial particles may be Varied alſo by their Motion, confirm'd by an Inſtance of the ſmoaking Liquor (35.) eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Superficial parts be of ſuch a Nature as to appear divers in ſeveral Poſtures, explain'd by the variety of Colours exhibited by the ſhaken Leaves of ſome Plants (36.) and by change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Taffities (37, 38, 39.) The Authors wiſh that the Variety of Colours in Mother of Pearl were examin'd with a</hi> Microſcope (40.) <hi>And his Conjectures, that poſſibly good</hi> Microſcopes <hi>might diſcover thoſe Superficial inequalities to be Real, which we now only imagine, with his reaſons drawn partly from the Diſcoveries of the</hi> Teleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope, <hi>and</hi> Microſcope (41.) <hi>And partly alſo from the Prodigiouſly ſtrange example of a Blind man that could feel Colours (42.) whoſe Hiſtory is Related (43, 44, 45.) The Authors conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and thoughts of it (46, 47, 48, 49.) and ſeveral Concluſions and Corollaries drawn from it about the Nature of Blackneſs and Black Bodies (50, 51, 52.) and about the Aſperities of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Colour'd Bodies (53.) And from theſe, and ſome premis'd Conſiderations, are propos'd ſome Conjectures; That the reaſon of the ſeveral Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of Colours, afterwards to be met with, depends upon the Diſpoſition of the Seen parts of the Object (54.) That Liquors may alter the Colours of each other, and of other Bodies, first by their Inſinuating themſelves into the Pores, and
<pb facs="tcp:56394:12"/>
filling them, whence the Aſperity of the Surface of a Body becomes alter'd, explicated with ſome Inſtances (55, 56.) Next by removing thoſe Bodies, which before hindred the appearance of the Genuine Colour, confirm'd by ſeveral examples (57) Thirdly, by making a Fiſſure or Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either in the Contiguous or Continued Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of a Body (58.) Fourthly, by a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion or Conjunction of the formerly ſeparated Particles; Illuſtrated with divers Inſtances of precipitated Bodies (59.) Fifthly, by Diſlocating the parts, and putting them both into other Orders and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, which is Illustrated with Inſtances (60, 61.) Sixthly, by Motion, which is explain'd (62.) And laſtly, and chiefly, by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Saline Bodies, with the Superficial parts of another Body, whereby both their Bigneſs and Shape muſt neceſſarily be alter'd (63, 64.) Explain'd by Experiments (65, 66.) That the Colour of Bodies may be Chang'd by the concurrence of two or more of theſe ways (67.) And beſides all theſe, Eight Reflective cauſes of Colours, there may be in Tranſparent Bodies ſeveral Refractive (68, 69.) Why the Author thinks the Nature of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours deſerves yet a further Inquiry (69.) Firſt, for that the little Motes of Dust exhibited very lovely Colours in a darkned Room, whilſt in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient poſture to the Eye, which in other Poſtures and Lights they did not (70.) And that though the ſmaller Parts of ſome Colour'd Bodies are Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, yet of others they are not, ſo that the firſt Doubt's, whether the Superficial parts create thoſe Colours, and the ſecond, whether there be any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction at all in the later (71, 72, 73.) A
<pb facs="tcp:56394:12"/>
famous Controverſie among Philoſophers, about the Nature of Colour decided.</hi> (74. 75.)</p>
                     <p>Chap. 4. <hi>The controverſie ſtated about Real and Emphatical Colours (75, 76.) That the great Diſparity between them ſeems to be, partly their Duration in the ſame ſtate, and partly, that Genuine Colours are produc'd in Opacous Bodies by Reflection, and Emphatical in Tranſparent by Refraction (78.) but that this is not to be taken in too large a Senſe, the Cautionary inſtance of Froth is alleged and inſiſted on (78, 79.) That the Duration is not a ſufficient Characteristick, exemplify'd by the duration of Froth, and other Emphatical Colours, and the ſuddain fading of Flowers, and other Bodies of Real ones (80.) That the poſition of the Eye is not neceſſary to the diſcerning Emphatical Colours, ſhew'd by the ſeeing white Froth, or an Iris caſt on the Wall by a Priſm, in what place of the Room ſoever the Eye be (81.) which proceeds from the ſpecular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of the Wall (82.) that Emphatical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours may be Compounded, and that the preſent Diſcourſe is not much concern'd, whether there be, or be not made a diſtinction between Real and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical Colours.</hi> (83.)</p>
                     <p>Chap. 5. <hi>Six Hypotheſes about Colour recited (84, 85) Why the Author cannot more fully Speak of any of theſe (86.) nor Acquieſce in them (87, 88.) What</hi> Pyrophilus <hi>is to expect in this Treatiſe (88, 89.) What Hypotheſis of Light and Colour the Author most inclines too (90.) Why he thinks neither that nor any other ſufficient; and what his Difficulties are, that

make him decline all Hypotheſes, and to think it very difficult to ſtick to any.</hi> (91, 92.)</p>

                        <p n="1">1 TO come then in the firſt place to our more general Conſiderations, I ſhall begin with ſaying ſomething as to the Importance of examining the Colours of Bodies. For there are ſome, eſpecially <hi>Chymists,</hi> who think, that a conſiderable diverſity of Colours does conſtantly argue an equal diverſity of Nature, in the Bodies wherein it is conſpicuous; but I confeſs I am not altogether of their mind; for not to mention changeable Taffaties, the blew and golden necks of Pidgeons, and divers Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-fowl, Rainbows Natural and Artificial, and other Bodies, whoſe Colours the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have been pleaſed to call not Real, but Apparent and Phantaſtical; not to inſiſt on theſe, I ſay, (for fear of needleſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in a Controverſie) we ſee in Parrots, Goldfinches, and divers other Birds, not only that the contiguous feathers which are probably as near in properties as place, are ſome of them Red, and others White, ſome of them Blew, &amp; others Yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that in the ſeveral parts of the ſelf-ſame feather there may often be ſeen the greateſt diſpari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Colours; and ſo in the leaves of Tulips, July-flowers, and ſome other Vegetables
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56394:23"/>
the ſeveral leaves, and even the ſeveral parts of the ſame leaf, although no difference have been obſerved in their other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are frequently found painted with very different Colours. And ſuch a variety we have much more admired in that lovely plant which is commonly, and not unjuſtly call'd the <hi>Marvayl of Peru;</hi> for of divers ſcores of fine Flowers, which in its ſeaſon that gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Plant does almoſt daily produce, I have ſcarce taken notice of any two that were dyed perfectly alike. But though <hi>Pyro:</hi> ſuch things as theſe, among others, keep mee from daring to affirm, that the Diverſity and change of Colours does <hi>alwaies</hi> argue any great difference or alteration, betwixt, or in, the Bodies, wherein it is to be diſcerned, yet that <hi>oftentimes</hi> the Alteration of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours does ſignifie conſiderable Alterations in the diſpoſition of parts of Bodies, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Extraction of Tinctures, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Chymical Operations, wherein the change of Colours is the chief, and ſometimes the only thing, by which the Artiſt regulates his proceeding, and is taught to know when 'tis ſeaſonable for him to leave off. Inſtances of this ſort are more obvious in divers ſorts of fruits, as Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Plums, &amp;c. wherein, according a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> the Vegetable ſap is ſweetned, or otherwiſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56394:24"/>
ripened, by paſſing from one degree to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of Maturation, the external part of the fruit paſſes likewiſe from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Colour. But one of the nobleſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I have met with of this kind, is not ſo obvious; and that is the way of temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Steel to make Gravers, Drills, Springs, and other Mechanical Inſtruments, which we have divers times both made Artificers practiſe in our preſence, and tryed our ſelves, after the following manner. Firſt, the ſlender Steel to be tempered is to be hardened by heating as much of it as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite among glowing Coals, till it be glowing hot, but it muſt not be quenched aſſoon as it is taken from the fire (for that would make it too brittle, and ſpoil it) but muſt be held over a baſon of water, till it deſcend from a White heat to a Red one, which aſſoon as ever you perceive, you muſt immediacely quench as much as you deſire to harden in the cold water. The Steel thus hardened, will, if it be good, look ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what White and muſt be made bright at the end, that its change of Colours may be there conſpicuous; and then holding it ſo in the flame of a Candle, that the bright end may be, for about half an inch, or more, out of the flame, that the ſmoak do not ſtain or fully the brightneſs of it, you ſhall after a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56394:24"/>
while ſee that clean end, which is almoſt contiguous to the flame, paſs very nimbly from one Colour to another, as from a brighter Yellow, to a deeper and reddiſh Yellow, which Artificers call a <hi>ſanguine,</hi> and from that to a fainter firſt, and then a a deeper Blew. And to bring home this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment to our preſent purpoſe, it is found by daily Experience, that each of theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Colours argue ſuch a change made in the texture of the Steel, that if it be taken from the flame, and immediately quenched in the tallow (whereby it is ſetled in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever temper it had before) when it is Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, it is of ſuch a hardneſs as makes it fit for Gravers Drills, and ſuch like tools; but if it be kept a few minutes longer in the flame till it grow Blew, it becomes much ſofter, and unfit to make Gravers for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, but fit to make Springs for Watches, and ſuch like Inſtruments, which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commonly of that Colour; and if the Steel be kept in the flame, after that this deep Blew hath diſcloſed it ſelf, it will grow ſo ſoft, as to need to be new hardened again, before it can be brought to a temper, fit for Drills or Penknives. And I confeſs <hi>Pyro.</hi> I have taken much pleaſure to ſee the Colours run along from the parts of the Steel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to the flame, to the end of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56394:25"/>
and ſucceed one another ſo faſt, that if a man be not vigilant, to thruſt the Steel into the tallow at the very nick of time, at which it has attain'd its due Colour, he ſhall miſs of giving his tool the right temper. But becauſe the flame of a Candle is offenſive to my weak eyes, and becauſe it is apt to either black or ſully the contiguous part of the Steel which is held in it, and thereby hinder the change of Colours from being ſo long and clearly diſcern'd, I have ſometimes made this Experiment by laying the Steel to be tempered upon a heated bar of Iron, which we finde alſo to be employ'd by ſome Artificers in the tempering of ſuch great Inſtruments, as are too big to be ſoon heated ſufficiently by the flame of a Candle. And you may eaſily ſatisfie your ſelf <hi>Pyro:</hi> of the differing hardneſs and toughneſs, which is aſcribed to Steel temper'd at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Colours, if you break but ſome ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wires of Steel ſo temper'd, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how they differ in brittleneſs, and if with a file you alſo make tryal of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious degrees of hardneſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 But <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I muſt not at preſent any further proſecute the Conſideration of the importance of Experiments about Colours, not only becauſe you will in the following papers finde ſome Inſtances, that would here
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56394:25"/>
be preſented you out of their due place, of the uſe that may be made of ſuch Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in diſcovering in divers bodies, what kind the ſalt is, that is predominant in them; but alſo becauſe a ſpeculative Naturaliſt might juſtly enough allege, that as Light is ſo pleaſing an object, as to be well worth our looking on, though it diſcover'd to us nothing but its ſelf; ſo modifi'd Light cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Colour, were worth our contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though by underſtanding its Nature we ſhould be taught nothing elſe. And however, I need not make either you or my ſelf excuſes for entertaining you on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I am now about to treat of, ſince the pleaſure <hi>Pyro:</hi> takes in mixing and laying on of Colours, will I preſume keep him, and will (I am ſure) keep mee from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it troubleſome to ſet down, eſpecially after the tedious proceſſes (about other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) wherewith I fear I may have tyr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d him, ſome eaſie, and not unpleaſant Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments relating to that ſubject.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 But, before we deſcend to the more particular conſiderations, we are to preſent you concerning Colours, I preſume it will be ſeaſonable to propoſe at the very entrance a Diſtinction; the ignorance or neglect of which, ſeems to mee to have frequently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough occaſioned either miſtakes or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56394:26"/>
in the Writings of divers Modern Philoſophers; for Colour may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either as it is a quality reſiding in the body that is ſaid to be coloured, or to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie the light after ſuch or ſuch a manner; or elſe as the Light it ſelf, which ſo modifi'd, ſtrikes upon the organ of ſight, and ſo cauſes that Senſation which we call Colour; and that this latter may be look'd upon as the more proper, though not the uſual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the word Colour, will be made probable by divers paſſages in the inſuing part of our diſcourſe; and indeed it is the Light it ſelf, which after a certain manner, either mingled with ſhades, or ſome other waies troubled, ſtrikes our eyes, that does more immediately produce that motion in the organ, upon whoſe account men ſay they ſee ſuch or ſuch a Colour in the object; yet, becauſe there is in the body that is ſaid to be coloured, a certain diſpoſition of the ſuperficial particles, whereby it ſends the Light reflected, or refracted, to our eyes thus and thus alter'd, and not otherwiſe, it may alſo in ſome ſenſe be ſaid, that Colour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the viſible body; and therefore we ſhall not be againſt that way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Colours that is moſt uſ'd among the Modern Naturaliſts, provided we be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to have recourſe when occaſion ſhall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56394:26"/>
require to the premiſ'd diſtinction, and to take the more immediate cauſe of Colour to be the modifi'd Light it ſelf, as it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Senſory; though the diſpoſition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the colour'd body, as that modifies the Light, may be call'd by that name Metonimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally (to borrow a School term) or Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, that is in regard of its turning the Light, that rebounds from it, or paſſes thorow it, into this or that particular Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 I know not whether I may not on this occaſion add, that Colour is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Inherent quality of the object in the ſenſe that is wont to be declar'd by the Schools, or even in the ſenſe of ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Atomiſts, that, if we conſider the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more attentively, we ſhall ſee cauſe to ſuſpect, if not to conclude, that though Light do more immediately affect the organ of ſight, than do the bodies that ſend it thither, yet Light it ſelf produces the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Colour, but as it produces ſuch a determinate kind of local motion in ſome part of the brain; which, though it happen moſt commonly from the motion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the ſlender ſtrings of the <hi>Retina</hi> are put, by the appulſe of Light, yet if the like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happen to be produc'd by any other cauſe, wherein the Light concurrs not at
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56394:27"/>
all, a man ſhall think he ſees the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. For proof of this, I might put you in mind, that 'tis uſual for dreaming men to think they ſee the Images that appear to them in their ſleep, adorn'd ſome with this, and ſome with that lively Colour, whilſt yet, both the curtains of their bed, and thoſe of their eyes are cloſe drawn. And I might add the confidence with which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted perſons do oftentimes, when they are awake, think, they ſee black fiends in places, where there is no black object in ſight without them. But I will rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that not only when a man receives a great ſtroak upon his eye, or a very great one upon ſome other part of his head, he is wont to ſee, as it were, flaſhes of lightning, and little vivid, but vaniſhing flames, though perhaps his eyes be ſhut: But the like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions may happen, when the motion proceeds not from ſomething without, but from ſomething within the body, provided the unwonted fumes that wander up and down in the head, or the propagated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of any internal part in the body, do cauſe about the inward extremities of the Optick Nerve, ſuch a motion as is wont to be there produc'd, when the ſtroak of the Light upon the <hi>Retina</hi> makes us conclude, that we ſee either Light, or ſuch and ſuch a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56394:27"/>
Colour: This the moſt ingenious <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> hath very well obſerv'd, but becauſe he ſeems not to have exemplifi'd it by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obvious or peculiar obſervation, I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to illuſtrate this doctrine by a few Inſtances.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 And firſt, I remember, that having, through Gods goodneſs, been free for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years, from troubleſome Coughs, being afterwards, by an accident, ſuddenly caſt into a violent one, I did often, when I was awaked in the night by my diſtempers, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that upon coughing ſtrongly, it would ſeem to mee, that I ſaw very vivid, but immediately diſappearing flames, which I took particular notice of, becauſe of the conjecture I am now mentioning.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 An excellent and very diſcreet perſon, very near ally'd both to you and mee, was relating to mee, that ſome time ſince, whilſt ſhe was talking with ſome other Ladies, upon a ſudden, all the objects, ſhe looked upon, appeared to her dyed with unuſual Colours, ſome of one kind, and ſome of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but all ſo bright and vivid, that ſhe ſhould have been as much delighted, as ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with them, but that finding the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition to continue, ſhe fear'd it portended ſome very great alteration as to her health: As indeed the day after ſhe was aſſaulted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56394:28"/>
with ſuch violence by Hyſterical and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condrical Diſtempers, as both made her rave for ſome daies, and gave her, during that time, a Baſtard Palſey.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 Being a while ſince in a Town, where the Plague had made great havock, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of an ingenious man, that was ſo bold, as without much ſcruple to viſit thoſe that were ſick of it, about the odd ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of a Diſeaſe that had ſwept away ſo many there; he told mee, among other things, that he was able to tell divers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, to whom he was called, before they took their beds, or had any evident ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of the Plague, that they were indeed infected, upon peculiar obſervations, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked, they would tell him that the neighbouring objects, and particularly his cloths, appear'd to them beautifi'd with moſt glorious Colours, like thoſe of the Rain-bow, oftentimes ſucceeding one another; and this he affirm'd to be one of the moſt uſual, as well as the moſt early ſymptomes, by which this odd Peſtilence diſcloſ'd it ſelf: And when I asked how long the Patients were wont to be thus affected, he anſwered, that it was moſt commonly for about a day; and when I further inquired whether or no Vomits, which in that Peſtilence were uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given, did not remove this ſymptome
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56394:28"/>
(For ſome uſed the taking of a Vomit, when they came aſhore, to cure themſelves of the obſtinate and troubleſome giddineſs cauſ'd by the motion of the ſhip) reply'd, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, upon the evacuation made by the Vomit, that ſtrange apparition of Colours ceaſed, though the other ſymptomes were not ſo ſoon abated, yet he added (to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that upon the by, becauſe the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation may perchance do good) that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Phyſician, in whoſe company he was wont to viſit the ſick, did give to almoſt all thoſe to whom he was called, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning before Nature was much weakened, a pretty odd Vomit conſiſting of eight or ten dramms of Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> and about half a dramm, or much more, of White Vitriol, with ſuch ſucceſs, that ſcarce one of ten to whom it was ſeaſonably admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, miſcarried.</p>
                        <p n="8">8 But to return to the conſideration of Colours: As an apparition of them may be produced by motions from within, without the aſſiſtance of an outward object, ſo I have obſerved, that 'tis ſometimes poſſible that the Colour that would otherwiſe be produced by an outward object, may be chang'd by ſome motion, or new texture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready produced in the Senſory, as long as that unuſual motion, or new diſpoſition
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56394:29"/>
laſts; for I have divers times try'd, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have through a Teleſcope look'd upon the Sun, though thorow a thick, red, or blew glaſs, to make its ſplendor ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the eye, the impreſſion upon the <hi>Retina,</hi> would be not only ſo vivid, but ſo permanent, that if afterwards I turned my eye towards a flame, it would appear to mee of a Colour very differing from its uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al one. And if I did divers times ſucceſſively ſhut and open the ſame eye, I ſhould ſee the adventitious Colour (if I may ſo call it) changed or impair'd by degrees, till at length (for this unuſual motion of the eye would not preſently ceaſe) the flame would appear to mee, of the ſame hew that it did to other beholders; a not unlike effect I found by looking upon the Moon, when ſhe was near full, thorow an excellent Teleſcope, without colour'd Glaſs to ſcreen my eye with; But that which I deſire may be taken notice of, becauſe we may elſewhere have occaſion to reflect upon it, and becauſe it ſeems not agreeable to what Anatomiſts and Optical Writers deliver, touching the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two eyes to each other, is this circumſtance, that though my Right eye, with which I looked thorow the Teleſcope, were thus affected by the over-ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the light, yet when the flame
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56394:29"/>
of a Candle, or ſome other bright object ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to me of a very unuſual Colour, whilſt look'd upon with the Diſcompoſ'd Eye, or (though not ſo notably) with both eyes at once; yet if I ſhut that Eye, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſame object with the other, it would appear with no other than its uſual Colour, though if I again opened, and made uſe of the Dazled eye, the vivid adventitious Colour would again appear. And on this occaſion I muſt not pretermit an Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which may perſwade us, that an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vehement ſtroak upon the Senſory, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it be naturally of a weak conſtitution, may make a more laſting impreſſion than one would imagine, which impreſſion may in ſome caſes, as it were, mingle with, and vitiate the action of vivid objects for a long time after.</p>
                        <p>For I know a Lady of unqueſtionable Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, who having lately, by a deſperate fall, receiv'd ſeveral hurts, and particularly a conſiderable one upon a part of her face near her Eye, had her ſight ſo troubl'd and diſorder'd, that, as ſhe hath more than once related to me, not only when the next morning one of her ſervants came to her bed ſide, to ask how ſhe did, his cloaths ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd adorn'd with ſuch variety of dazling Colours, that ſhe was fain preſently to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56394:30"/>
command him to withdraw, but the Images in her Hangings, did, for many daies after, appear to her, if the Room were not extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily darken'd, embelliſh'd with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral offenſively vivid Colours, which no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe could ſee in them; And when I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd whether or no White Objects did not appear to her adorn'd with more lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Colours than others, and whether ſhe ſaw not ſome which ſhe could not now well deſcribe to any, whoſe eyes had never been diſtemper'd, ſhe anſwer'd mee, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe thought ſhe ſaw Colours ſo new and glorious, that they were of a peculiat kind, and ſuch as ſhe could not deſcribe by their likeneſs to any ſhe had beheld either before or ſince, and that White Objects did ſo much diſorder her ſight, that if ſeveral daies after her fall, ſhe look'd upon the in-ſide of a Book, ſhe fanci'd ſhe ſaw there Colours like thoſe of the Rain-bow, and even when ſhe thought her ſelf pretty well recover'd, and made bold to leave her Chamber, the coming into a place where the Walls and Ceeling were whited over, made thoſe Objects appear to her cloath'd with ſuch glorious and dazling Colours, as much offended her ſight, and made her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent her venturouſneſs, and ſhe added, that this Diſtemper of her Eyes laſted no leſs

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56394:31"/>
(of Colour) that I mentioned to you about the beginning of the third Section of the former Chapter; and therefore, after all I have ſaid of Colour, as it is modifi'd Light, and immediately affects the Senſory, I ſhall now re-mind you, that I did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that Colour might in ſome ſenſe be conſider'd as a Quality reſiding in the body that is ſaid to be Colour'd, and indeed the greateſt part of the following Experiments referr to Colour principally under that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for there is in the bodyes we call Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd, and chiefly in their Superficial parts, a certain diſpoſition, whereby they do ſo trouble the Light that comes from them to our Eye, as that it there makes that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Impreſſion, upon whoſe Account we ſay, that the Seen body is either White or Black, or Red or Yellow, or of any one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Colour. But becauſe we ſhall (God permiting) by the Experiments that are to follow ſome Pages hence, more fully and particularly ſhew, that the Changes, and conſequently in divers places the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and the appearance of Colours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the continuing or alter'd Texture of the Object, we ſhall in this place intimate (and that too but as by the way) two or three things about this Matter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And firſt it is not without ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56394:32"/>
that I aſcribe Colour (in the ſenſe formerly explan'd) <hi>chiefly</hi> to the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial parts of Bodies, for not to queſtion how much Opacous Corpuſcles may abound even in thoſe Bodies we call Diaphanous, it ſeems plain that of Opacous bodies we do indeed ſee little elſe than the Superficies, for if we found the beams of Light that rebound from the Object to the Eye, to peirce deep into the Colour'd body, we ſhould not judge it Opacous, but either Tranſlucid, or at leaſt Semi-diaphanous, and though the Schools ſeem to teach us that Colour is a Penetrative Quality, that reaches to the Innermoſt parts of the Object, as if a piece of Sealing-wax be broken into never ſo many pieces, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal fragments will be as Red as the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſurface did appear, yet that is but a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Example that will not overthrow the Reaſon lately offer'd, eſpecially ſince I can alleage other Examples of a contrary Import, and two or three Negative In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are ſufficient to overthrow the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of a Poſitive Rule, eſpecially if that be built but upon One or a Few Examples. Not (then) to mention Cherries, Plums, and I know not how many other Bodies, wherein the skin is of one Colour, and what it hides of another, I ſhall name a couple of Inſtances drawn from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56394:32"/>
of Durable bodies that are thought far more Homogeneous, and have not parts that are either Organical, or of a Nature approaching thereunto.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 To give you the firſt Inſtance, I ſhall need but to remind you of what I told you a little after the beginning of this Eſſay, touching the Blew and Red and Yellow, that may be produc'd upon a piece of temper'd Steel, for theſe Colours though they be very Vivid, yet if you break the Steel they adorn, they will appear to be but Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; not only the innermoſt parts of the Metall, but thoſe that are within a hairs breadth of the Superficies, having not any of theſe Colours, but retaining that of the Steel it ſelf. Beſides that, we may as well confirm this Obſervation, as ſome other particulars we elſewhere deliver concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Colours, by the following Experiment which we purpoſely made.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. We took a good quantity of clean Lead, and melted it with a ſtrong Fire, and then immediately pouring it out into a clean Veſſel of a convenient ſhape and matter, (we us'd one of Iron, that the great and ſudden Heat might not injure it) and then carefully and nimbly taking off the Scum that floated on the top, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, as we expected, the ſmooth and

                           </gap> glorious Colour, which being as Tranſitory as Delightfull, did almoſt immediately give place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vivid Colour, and that was as quickly ſucceeded by a third, and this as it were chas'd away by a fourth, and ſo theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully vivid Colours ſucceſſively appear'd and vaniſh'd, (yet the ſame now and then appearing the ſecond time) till the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ceaſing to be hot enough to afford any longer this pleaſing Spectacle, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours that chanc'd to adorn the Surface, when the Lead thus began to cool, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd upon it; but were ſo Superficial, that how little ſoever we ſcrap'd off the Surface of the Lead, we did in ſuch places ſcrape off all the Colour, and diſcover only that which is natural to the Metall it ſelf, which receiving its adventitious Colours, only when the heat was very Intenſe, and in that part which was expos'd to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively very cold Air, (which by other Experiments ſeems to abound with ſubtil Saline parts, perhaps not uncapable of working upon Lead ſo dispos'd:) Theſe things I ſay, together with my obſerving that whatever parts of the ſo ſtrongly mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lead were expos'd a while to the Air, turn'd into a kind of Scum or Litharge,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56394:33"/>
how bright and clean ſoever they appear'd before, ſuggeſted to me ſome Thoughts or Ravings, which I have not now time to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint You with. One that did not know me, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> would perchance think I endeavour'd to impoſe upon You by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Experiment, which I have ſeveral times try'd, but the Reaſon why the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> mention'd have not been taken notice of, may be, that unleſs Lead be brought to a much higher degree of Fuſion or Fluidity than is uſual, or than is indeed requiſite to make it melt, the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> I mention'd will ſcarce at all diſcloſe themſelves; And we have alſo obſerv'd that this ſucceſſive appearing and vaniſhing of vivid Colours, was wont to be impair'd or determin'd whilſt the Metal expos'd to the Air re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd yet hotter than one would readily ſuſpect. And one thing I muſt further Note, of which I leave You to ſearch after the Reaſon, namely, that the ſame Colours did not always and regularly ſucceed one another, as is uſually in Steel, but in the diverſify'd Order mention'd in this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Note, which I was ſcarce able to write down, the ſucceſſion of the Colours was ſo very quick, whether that proceeded from the differing degrees of Heat in the Lead expos'd to the cool Air, or from ſome

other Reaſon, I leave you to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.

The <hi>Atomists</hi> of Old, and ſome Learned men of late, have attempted to explicate the variety of Colours in Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous bodies from the various Figures of their Superficial parts; the attempt is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, and the Doctrine ſeems partly True, but I confeſs I think there are divers other things that muſt be taken in as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current to produce thoſe differing forms of Aſperity, whereon the Colours of Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous bodies ſeem to depend. To declare this a little, we muſt aſſume, that the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces of all ſuch Bodies how Smooth or polite ſoever they may appear to our Dull Sight and Touch, are exactly ſmooth only in a popular, or at moſt in a Phyſical ſenſe, but not in a ſtrict and rigid ſenſe.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. This, excellent <hi>Microſcopes</hi> ſhew us in many Bodies, that ſeem Smooth to our naked Eyes; and this not only as to the little Hillocks or Protuberancies that ſwell

above that which may be conceiv'd to be the Plain or Level of the conſider'd Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, for it is obvious enough to thoſe that are any thing converſant with ſuch Glaſſes, but as to numerous Depreſſions beneath that Level, of which ſort of Cavities by the help of a <hi>Microſcope,</hi> which the greateſt Artificer that makes them, judges to be the greateſt Magnifying Glaſs in <hi>Europe,</hi> except one that equals it, we have on the Surface of a thin piece of Cork that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſmooth to the Eye, obſerv'd about ſixty in a Row, within the length of leſs then an 31 and 32 part of an Inch, (for the Glaſs takes in no longer a ſpace at one view) and theſe Cavities (which made that little piece of Cork look almoſt like an empty Honey-comb) were not only very diſtinct, and figur'd like one another, but of a conſiderable bigneſs, and a ſcarce credible depth; inſomuch that their diſtinct ſhadows as well as ſides were plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd and eaſily to be reckon'd, and might have been well diſtinguiſh'd, though they had been ten times leſſer than they were; which I thought it not amiſs to mention to you <hi>Pyrophilus</hi> upon the by, that you may thence make ſome Eſtimate, what a ſtrange Inequality, and what a multitude of little Shades, there may really be, in a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56394:35"/>
ſcarce ſenſible part of the Phyſical ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, though the naked Eye ſees no ſuch matter. And as Excellent <hi>Microſcopes</hi> ſhew us this Ruggedneſs in many Bodies that paſs for Smooth, ſo there are divers Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though we muſt not now ſtay to urge them, which ſeem to perſwade us of the ſame thing as to the reſt of ſuch Bodies as we are now treating off; So, that there is no ſenſible part of an Opacous body, that may not be conceiv'd to be made up of a multitude of ſingly inſenſible Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but in the giving theſe Surfaces that diſpoſition, which makes them alter the Light that reflects thence to the Eye after the manner requiſite to make the Object appear Green; Blew, &amp;c. the Figures of theſe Particles have <hi>a great,</hi> but not <hi>the only</hi> ſtroak. 'Tis true indeed that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberant Particles may be of very great variety of Figures, Sphaerical, Elliptical, Conical, Cylindrical, Polyedrical, and ſome very irregular, and that according to the Nature of theſe, and the ſituation of the Lucid body, the Light muſt be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affected, after one manner from Surfaces (I now ſpeak of Phyſical Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces) conſiſting of Sphaerical, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from thoſe that are made up of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical or Cylindrical Corpuſcles; ſome
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56394:35"/>
being fitted to reflect more of the incident Beams of Light, others leſs, and ſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one part, others towards another. But beſides this difference of Shape, there may be divers other things that may emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently concurr to vary the forms of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity that Colours ſo much depend on. For, willingly allowing the Figure of the Particles in the firſt place, I conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the ſuperficial Corpuſcles, if I may ſo call them, may be bigger in one Body, and leſs in another, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted to allay the Light falling on them with greater ſhades. Next, the protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Particles may be ſet more or leſs cloſe together, that is, there may be a greater or a ſmaller number of them within the compaſs of one, than within the compaſs of another ſmall part of the Surface of the ſame Extent, and how much theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities may ſerve to produce Colour may be ſomewhat gueſs'd at, by that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the Agitation of Water; for if the Bubbles that are thereby made be Great, and but Few, the Water will ſcarce acquire a ſenſible Colour, but if it be reduc'd to a Froth, conſiſting of Bubbles, which being very Minute and Contiguous to each other, are a multitude of them crowded into a narrow Room, the Water (turned to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56394:36"/>
Froth) does then exhibit a very manifeſt White Colour, (to which theſe laſt nam'd Conditions of the Bubbles do as well as their Convex <note place="margin">See the Diſcourſe of the Nature of Whiteneſs and Blackneſs.</note> figure contribute) and that for Reaſons to be mention'd anon. Beſides, it is not neceſſary that the Superficial particles that exhibit one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſhould be all of them Round, or all Conical, or all of any one Shape, but Corpuſcles of differing Figures may be mingled on the Surface of the Opacous Body, as when the Corpuſcles that make a Blew colour, and thoſe that make a Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, come to be Accurately and Skilfully mix'd, they make up a Green, which though it ſeem one ſimple Colour, yet in this caſe appears to be made by Corpuſcles of very differing Kinds, duely commix'd. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Figure and Bigneſs of the little Depreſſions, Cavities, Furrows or Pores intercepted betwixt theſe protuberant Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, are as well to be conſider'd as the Sizes and Shapes of the Corpuſcles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: For we may conceive the Phyſical ſuperficies of a Body, where (as we ſaid) its Colour does as it were reſide, to be cut Tranſverſly by a Mathematical plain, which you know is conceiv'd to be without any Depth or Thickneſs at all, and then as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56394:36"/>
ſome parts of the Phyſical ſuperficies will be Protuberant, or ſwell above this laſt plain, ſo others may be depreſs'd beneath it, as (to explane my ſelf by a groſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon) in divers places of the Surface of the Earth, there are not only Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hills, Trees, &amp;c. that are rais'd above the Horizontal Level of the Valley, but Rivers, Wells, Pits and other Cavities that are depreſs'd beneath it, and that ſuch Protuberant and Concave parts of a Surface may remit the Light ſo differingly, as much to vary a Colour, ſome examples and other things, that we ſhall hereafter have occaſion to take notice off in this Tract, will ſufficiently declare, till when, it may ſuffice to put you in mind, that of two Flat-ſides of the ſame piece of, for example, red Marble, the one being dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently Poliſhed, and the other left to its former Roughneſs, the differing degrees or ſorts of Aſperity, for the ſide that is ſmooth to the Touch wants not its Roughneſs, will ſo diverſifie the Light reflected from the ſeveral Plains to the Eye, that a Painter would employ two differing Colours to repreſent them.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And I hope, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> you will not think it ſtrange or impertinent, that I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in divers paſſages of theſe Papers,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56394:37"/>
examples drawn from Bodies and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows far more Groſs, than thoſe minute Protuberances and ſhady Pores on which in moſt caſes the Colour of a Body as 'tis an Inherent Quality or Diſpoſition of its Surface, ſeems to depend. For ſometimes I employ ſuch Examples, rather to declare my Meaning, than prove my Conjecture; things, whom their Smallneſs makes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible; being better repreſented to the Imagination by ſuch familiar Objects, as being like them enough in other reſpects, are of a Viſible bulk. And next, though the Beams of Light are ſuch ſubtil Bodies, that in reſpect of them, even Surfaces that are ſenſibly Smooth, are not exactly ſo, but have their own degree of Roughneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of little Protuberances and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; and though conſequently ſuch Inequalities may ſuffice to give Bodies dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Colours, as we ſee in Marble that appears White or Black, or Red or Blew, even when the moſt carefully Poliſh'd, yet 'tis plain by the late Inſtance of Red Marble; and many others, that even bigger Protuberances and greater Shades may likewiſe ſo Diverſifie the Roughneſs of a Bodies Superficies, as manifeſtly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr to the varying of its Colour, whereby ſuch Examples appear to be proper enough
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56394:37"/>
to be employ'd in ſuch a Subject as we have now in hand. And having hinted thus much on this Occaſion, I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>

The Situation alſo of the Superficial particles is conſiderable, which I diſtinguiſh into the Poſture of the ſingle Corpuſcles, in reſpect of the Light, and of the Eye, and the Order of them in reference alſo to one another; for a Body may otherwiſe reflect the Light, when its Superficial particles are more erected upon the Plain that may be conceiv'd to paſs along their Baſis, and when the Points or Extremes of ſuch Particles are Obverted to the Eye, than when thoſe Particles are ſo Inclin'd, that their Sides are in great part Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as the Colour of Pluſh or Velvet will appear Vary'd to you, if you carefully ſtroak part of it one way, and part of it another, the poſture of the particular Thrids, in reference to the Light, or the Eye, becoming thereby different. And you may obſerve in a Field of ripe Corn blown upon by the Wind, that there will appear as it were Waves of a Colour (at leaſt Gradually) differing from that of the reſt of the Field, the Wind by Depreſſing ſome of the Ears, and not at the ſame time others, making the one Reflect more from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56394:38"/>
the Lateral and Strawy parts, than do the reſt. And ſo, when Doggs are ſo angry, as to Erect the Hairs upon their Necks, and upon ſome other parts of their Bodies, thoſe Parts ſeem to acquire a Colour vary'd from that which the ſame Hairs made, when in their uſual Poſture they did farr more ſtoop. And that the Order wherein the Superficial Corpuſcles are Rang'd is not to be neglected, we may gueſs by turning of Water into Froth, the beating of Glaſs, and the ſcraping of Horns, in which caſes the Corpuſcles that were before ſo marſhall'd as to be Perſpicuous, do by the troubling of that Order become Diſpos'd to terminate and reflect more Light, and thereby to appear Whitiſh. And there are other ways in which the Order of the Protuberant parts, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Eye, may much contribute to the appearing of a particular Colour, for I have often obſerv'd, that when Peaſe are Planted, or Set in Parallel Lines, and are Shot up about half a Foot above the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Ground, by looking on the Field or Plot of Ground from that part towards which the Parallel Lines tended, the greater part of the Ground by farr would appear of its own dirty Colour, but if I look'd upon it Tranſverſly, the Plot
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56394:38"/>
would appear very Green, the upper parts of the Peaſe hindering the intercepted parts of the Ground, which as I ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd their wonted Colour, from being diſcover'd by the Eye. And I know not, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> whether I might not add, that even the Motion of the Small Parts of a Viſible Object may in ſome caſes contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, though it be not ſo eaſie to ſay how, to the Producing or the Varying of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; for I have ſeveral times made a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which when it has well ſettled in a cloſe Vial, is Tranſparent and Colourleſs, but as ſoon as the Glaſs is unſtopp'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to fly away very plentifully in a White and Opacous fume; and there are other Bodies, whoſe Fumes, when they fill a Receiver, would make one ſuſpect it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Milk, and yet when theſe Fumes ſettle into a Liquor, that Liquor is not White, but Tranſparent; And ſuch White Fumes I have ſeen afforded by unſtopping a Liquor I know, which yet is it ſelf Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous and Red; Nor are theſe the only Inſtances of this Kind, that our Tryals can ſupply us with. And if the Superficial Corpuſcles be of the Groſſer ſort, and be ſo Framed, that their differing Sides or Faces may exhibit differing Colours, then the Motion or Reſt of thoſe Corpuſcles may be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56394:39"/>
conſiderable, as to the Colour of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies they compoſe, upon this account, that ſometimes more, ſometimes fewer of the Sides diſpos'd to exhibit ſuch a Colour may by this means become or continue more Obverted to the Eye than the reſt, and compoſe a Phyſical Surface, that will be more or leſs ſenſibly interrupted; As, to explane my meaning, by propoſing a groſs Example, I remember, that in ſome ſorts of Leavy Plants thick ſet by one another, the two ſides of whoſe Leaves were of ſomewhat differing Colours, there would be a notable Diſparity as to Colour, if you look'd upon them both when the Leaves being at Reſt had their upper and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly expos'd ſides Obverted to the Eye, and when a breath of Wind paſſing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row them, made great Numbers of the uſually Hidden ſides of the Leaves become conſpicuous. And though the Little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, we were lately ſpeaking of, may Singly and Apart ſeem almoſt Colourleſs, yet when Many of them are plac'd by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo near, that the Eye does not eaſily diſcern an Interruption, within a ſenſible ſpace, they may exhibit a Colour; as we ſee, that though a Slendereſt Thrid of Dy'd Silk do's, whilſt look'd on Single, ſeem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt quite Devoyd of Redneſs, (for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56394:39"/>
yet when numbers of theſe Thrids are brought together into one Skein, their Colour becomes notorious.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But the ſame Occaſion that invited me to ſay what I have mention'd concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Leaves of Trees, invites me alſo to give you ſome account of what happens in Changeable Taffities, where we ſee dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Colours, as it were, Emerge and Vaniſh upon the Ruffling of the ſame piece of Silk: As I have divers times with Pleaſure obſerv'd, by the help of ſuch a <hi>Microſcope,</hi> as, though it do not very much Magnifie the Object, has in recompence this great Conveniency, that you may eaſily, as faſt as you pleaſe, remove it from one part to another of a Large Object, of which the Glaſs taking a great part at once, you may thereby preſently Survey the Whole. Now by the help of ſuch a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope</hi> I could eaſily (as I began to ſay) diſcern, that in a piece of Changeable Taffity, (that appear'd, for Inſtance, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Red, and ſometimes Green) the Stuff was compos'd of Red thrids and Green, paſſing under and over each other, and croſſing one another in almoſt innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable points; and if I look'd through the Glaſs upon any conſiderable portion of the Stuff, that (for example ſake) to the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56394:40"/>
naked Eye appear'd to be Red, I could plainly ſee, that in that Poſition, the Red thrids were Conſpicuous, and reflected a vivid Light; and though I could alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that there were Green ones, yet by reaſon of their diſadvantagious Poſition in the <hi>Phyſical Surface</hi> of the Taffity, they were in part hid by the more Protuberant Thrids of the other Colour; and for the ſame cauſe, the Reflection from as much of the Green as was diſcover'd, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively but Dim and Faint. And if, on the contrary, I look'd through the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope</hi> upon any part that appear'd Green, I could plainly ſee that the Red thrids were leſs fully expos'd to the Eye, and obſcur'd by the Green ones, which therefore made up the Predominant Colour. And by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Texture of the Silken Stuff, I could eaſiſy ſo expoſe the Thrids either of the one Colour or of the other to my Eye, as at pleaſure to exhibit an apparition of Red or Green, or make thoſe Colours ſucceed one another: So that, when I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd their Succeſſion by the help of the Glaſs, I could mark how the Predominant Colour did as it were ſtart out, when the Thrids that exhibited it came to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly plac'd; And by making little Folds in the Stuff after a certain manner,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56394:40"/>
the Sides that met and terminated in thoſe Folds, would appear to the naked Eye, one of them Red, and the other Green. When Thrids of more than two differing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours chance to be Interwoven, the reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing changeableneſs of the Taffity may be alſo ſomewhat different. But I chooſe to give an Inſtance in the Stuff I have been ſpeaking off, becauſe the mixture being more Simple, the way whereby the Change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs is produc'd, may be the more eaſily apprehended: and though Reaſon alone might readily enough lead a conſidering Man to gueſs at the Explication, in caſe he knew how Changeable Taffities are made: yet I thought it not impertinent to mention it, becauſe both Scholars and Gentlemen are wont to look upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into Manufactures, as a <hi>Mechanick</hi> imployment, and conſequently below Them; and becauſe alſo with ſuch a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope</hi> as I have been mentioning, the diſcovery is as well Pleaſant as Satisfactory, and may affor'd Hints of the Solution of other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Colours. And it were not amiſs, that ſome diligent Inquiry were made, whether the <hi>Microſcope</hi> would give us an account of the Variableneſs of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that is ſo Conſpicuous and ſo Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Mother of Pearl, in Opalls, and ſome
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56394:41"/>
other reſembling Bodies: For though I remember I did formerly attempt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that Kind (fruitleſly enough) upon Mother of Pearl, yet not having then the advantage of my beſt <hi>Microſcope,</hi> nor ſome Conveniences that might have been wiſh'd, I leave it to you, who have better Eyes, to try what you can do further; ſince 'twill be <hi>Some</hi> diſcovery to find, that, in this caſe, the beſt Eyes and <hi>Microſcopes</hi> themſelves can make <hi>None.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. I confeſs, <hi>Pyrophilus;</hi> that a great part of what I have deliver'd, (or propos'd rather) concerning the differing forms of Aſperity in Bodies, by which Differences the incident Light either comes to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected with more or leſs of Shade, and with that Shade more or leſs Interrupted, or elſe happens to be alſo otherwiſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dify'd or Troubl'd, is but Conjectural. But I am not ſure, that if it were not for the Dulneſs of our Senſes, either theſe or ſome other Notions of Kin to them, might be better Countenanc'd; for I am apt to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that if we were Sharp ſighted enough, or had ſuch perfect <hi>Microſcopes,</hi> as I fear are more to be wiſh'd than hop'd for, our promoted Senſe might diſcern in the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Surfaces of Bodies, both a great many latent Ruggidneſſes, and the particular
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56394:41"/>
Sizes, Shapes, and Situations of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely little Bodies that cauſe them, and perhaps might perceive among other Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties that we now can but imagine, how thoſe little Protuberances and Cavities do Interrupt and Dilate the Light, by ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with it a multitude of little and ſingly undiſcernable Shades, though ſome of them more, and ſome of them leſs Minute, ſome leſs, and ſome more Numerous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature and Degree of the particular Colour we attribute to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Object; as we ſee, that in the Moon we can with Excellent <hi>Teleſcopes</hi> diſcern many Hills and Vallies, and as it were Pits and other Parts, whereof ſome are more, and ſome leſs Vividly illuſtrated, and others have a fainter, others a deeper Shade, though the naked Eye can diſcern no ſuch matter in that Planet. And with an Excellent <hi>Microſcope,</hi> where the <hi>Naked</hi> Eye did ſee but a Green powder, the <hi>Aſſisted</hi> Eye as we noted above, could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern particular Granules, ſome of them of a Blew, and ſome of them of a Yellow colour, which Corpuſcles we had before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand caus'd to be exquiſitly mix'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Green.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. And, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that you may not think me altogether extravagant in what I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56394:42"/>
have ſaid of the Poſſibility, (for I ſpeak of no more) of diſcerning the differing forms of Aſperity in the Surfaces of Bodies of ſeveral Colours, I'l here ſet down a Memorable particular that chanc'd to come to my Knowledge, ſince I writ a good part of this <hi>Eſſay;</hi> and it is this. Meeting caſually the other Day, with: the deſervedly Famous <note n="*" place="margin">Since for his eminent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty Grac'd, by his Majesty, with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> Dr. <hi>J. Finch,</hi> Extraordinary <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomist</hi> to that Great Patron of the <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> the now Great Duke of <hi>Toſcany,</hi> and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this Ingenious Perſon, what might be the chief Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he had ſeen in his late return out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> he told me, it was a Man at <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> in the Low-Countrys, who at certain times can diſcern and <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Colours by the Touch</hi> with his Fingers. You'l eaſily Conclude, that this is farr more ſtrange, than what I propos'd but as <hi>not Impoſſible;</hi> ſince the Senſe of the <hi>Retina</hi> ſeeming to be much more Tender and quick than that of thoſe Groſſer Filaments, Nerves or Membrances of our Fingers, wherewith we uſe to handle Groſs and Hard Bodies, it ſeems ſcarce credible, that any Accuſtomance, or Diet, or peculiarity of Conſtitution, ſhould enable a Man to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56394:42"/>
with ſuch Groſs and Unſuitable Organs, ſuch Nice and Subtile Differences as thoſe of the forms of Aſperity, that belong to differing Colours, to receive whoſe Languid and Delicate Impreſſions by the Intervention of Light, Nature ſeems to have appointed and contexed into the <hi>Retina</hi> the tender and delicate Pith of the Optick Nerve. Wherefore I confeſs, I propos'd divers Scruples, and particularly whether the Doctor had taken care to bind a Napkin or Hankerchief over his Eyes ſo carefully, as to be ſure he could make no uſe of his Sight, though he had but Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited the want of it, to which I added divers other Queſtions, to ſatisfie my Self, whether there were any Likelihood of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion or other Tricks. But I found that the Judicious Doctor having gone farr out of his way, purpoſely to ſatisfie Himſelf and his Learned Prince about this Wonder, had been very Watchfull and Circumſpect to keep <hi>Himſelf</hi> from being Impos'd upon. And that he might not through any miſtake in point of Memory miſ-inform <hi>Me,</hi> he did me the Favour at my Requeſt, to look out the Notes he had Written for his Own and his Princes Information, the ſumm of which Memorials, as far as we ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them here, was this, That the Doctor
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56394:43"/>
having been inform'd at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> that there Lived one at ſome Miles diſtance from <hi>Maestricht,</hi> who could diſtinguiſh Colours by the Touch, when he came to the laſt nam'd Town, he ſent a Meſſenger for him, and having Examin'd him, was told upon Enquiry theſe Particulars:</p>
                        <p>That the Man's name was <hi>John Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maaſen,</hi> at that time about 33 Years of Age; that when he was but two years Old, he had the Small Pox, which rendred him abſolutely Blind: That at this preſent he is an <hi>Organist,</hi> and ſerves that Office in a publick Quire.</p>
                        <p>That the Doctor diſcourſing with him over Night, the Blind man affirm'd, that he could diſtinguiſh Colours by the Touch, but that he could not do it, unleſs he were Faſting; Any quantity of Drink taking from him that Exquiſitneſs of Touch, which is requiſite to ſo Nice a Senſation.</p>
                        <p>That hereupon the Doctor provided againſt the next Morning ſeven pieces of Ribbon, of theſe ſeven Colours, Black, White, Red, Blew, Green, Yellow, and Gray, but as for <hi>mingled</hi> Colours, this <hi>Vermaaſen</hi> would not undertake to diſcern them, though if offer'd, he would tell that they were <hi>Mix'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That to diſcern the Colour of the Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56394:43"/>
he places it betwixt the Thumb and the Fore-finger, but his moſt exquiſite perception was in his Thumb, and much better in the right Thumb than in the left.</p>
                        <p>That after the Blind man had four or five times told the Doctor the ſeveral Colours, (though Blinded with a Napkin for fear he might have ſome Sight) the Doctor found he was twice miſtaken, for he call'd the White Black, and the Red Blew, but ſtill, he, before his Errour, would lay them by in Pairs, ſaying, that though he could eaſily diſtinguiſh them from all others, yet thoſe two Pairs were not eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd amongſt themſelves, whereupon the Doctor deſir'd to be told by him what kind of Diſcrimination he had of Colours by his Touch, to which he gave a reply, for whoſe ſake chiefly I inſert all this Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative in this place, namely, That all the difference was more or leſs Aſperity, for ſays he, (I give you the Doctor's own words) Black feels as if you were feeling Needles points, or ſome harſh Sand, and Red feels very Smooth.</p>
                        <p>That the Doctor having deſir'd him to tell in Order the difference of Colours to his Touch, he did as follows;</p>
                        <p>Black and White are the moſt aſperous
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56394:44"/>
or unequal of all Colours, and ſo like, that 'tis very hard to diſtinguiſh them, but Black is the moſt Rough of the two, Green is next in Aſperity, Gray next to Green in Aſperity, Yellow is the fifth in degree of Aſperity, Red and Blew are ſo like, that they are as hard to diſtinguiſh as Black and White, but Red is ſomewhat more Aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than Blew, ſo that Red has the ſixth place, and Blew the ſeventh in Aſperity.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. To theſe Informations the Obliging Doctor was pleas'd to add the welcome preſent of three of thoſe very pieces of Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, whoſe Colours in his preſence the Blind man had diſtinguiſhed, pronouncing the one Gray, the other Red, and the third Green, which I keep by me as Rarities, and the rather, becauſe he fear'd the reſt were miſcarry'd.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Before I ſaw the Notes that afforded me the precedent Narrative, I confeſs I ſuſpected this man might have thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminated Colours, rather by the Smell than by the Touch; for ſome of the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients imployed by Dyers to Colour things, have Sents, that are not ſo Languid, nor ſo near of Kin, but that I thought it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a very Critical Noſe might diſtinguiſh them, and this I the rather ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, becauſe he requir'd, that the Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56394:44"/>
whoſe Colours he was to Name, ſhould be offer'd him Faſting in the morning; for I have obſerv'd in Setting Doggs; that the feeding of them (epecially with ſome ſorts of Aliments) does very much impair the exquiſite ſent of their Noſes. And though ſome of the foregoing particulars would have prevented that Conjecture, yet I confeſs to you <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> that I would gladly have had the Opportunity of Examining this Man my ſelf, and of Queſtioning him about divers particulars which I do not find to have been yet thought upon. And though it be not incredible to me, that ſince the Liquors that Dyers imploy to tinge, are qualifi'd to do ſo by multitudes of little Corpuſcles of the Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Dying ſtuff, which are diſſolved and extracted by the Liquor, and ſwim to and fro in it, thoſe Corpuſcles of Colour (as the <hi>Atomiſts</hi> call them) inſinuating themſelves into, and filling all the Pores of the Body to be Dyed, may Aſperate its Superficies more or leſs according to the Bigneſs and Texture of the Corpuſcles of the Pigment; yet I can ſcarce believe, that our Blind man could diſtinguiſh all the Colours he did, meerly by the Ribbons having more or leſs of Aſperity, ſo that I cannot but think, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Hiſtory, that the Blind man
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56394:45"/>
diſtinguiſh'd Colours not only by the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of Aſperity in the Bodies offer'd to him, but by <hi>Forms</hi> of it, though this (latter) would perhaps have been very difficult for him to make an Intelligible mention of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Minute diſparities having not been taken notice of by men for want of touch as Exquiſite as our Blind Mans, are things he could not have Intelligibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, which will eaſily ſeem Probable, if you conſider, that under the name of Sharp, and Sweet, and Sour, there are abundance of, as it were, immediate peculiar Reliſhes or Taſts in differing ſorts of Wine, which though Critical and Experienc'd Palats can eaſily diſcern themſelves, cannot make them be underſtood by others, ſuch Minute diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences not having hitherto any Diſtinct names aſſign'd them. And it ſeems that there was ſomthing in the Forms of Aſperity that was requiſite to the Diſtinction of Colours, beſides the Degree of it, ſince he found it ſo difficult to diſtinguſh Black and White from one another, though not from other Colours. For I might urge, that he ſeems not conſonant to himſelf about the <hi>Red,</hi> which as you have ſeen in one place, he repreſents as ſomewhat more Aſperous than the <hi>Blew;</hi> and in another, very Smooth: But becauſe he ſpeaks of this Smoothneſs in that place,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56394:45"/>
where he mentions the Roughneſs of <hi>Black,</hi> we may favourably preſume that he might mean but a <hi>comparative Smoothneſs;</hi> and therefore I ſhall not Inſiſt on this, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countenance my Conjecture by this, that he found it ſo Difficult, not only, to Diſcriminate Red and Blew, (though the firſt of our promiſcuous Experiments will inform you, that the Red reflects by great Odds more Light than the other) but alſo to diſtinguiſh Black and White from one another, though not from other Colours. And indeed, though in the Ribbonds that were offer'd him, they might be almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Rough, yet in ſuch ſlender Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as thoſe of Colour, there may eaſily enough be Conceiv'd, not only a greater Cloſeneſs of Parts, or elſe Paucity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberant Corpuſeles, and the little extant Particles may be otherwiſe Figur'd, and Rang'd in the White than in the Black, but the Cavities may be much Deeper in the one than the other.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. And perhaps, <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> it may prove ſome <hi>Illuſtration of what I mean,</hi> and help you to conceive how <hi>this may</hi> be, if I Repreſent, that where the Particles are ſo exceeding Slender, we may allow the Parts expos'd to the Sight and Touch to be a little Convex in compariſon of the Erected
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56394:46"/>
Particles of Black Bodies, as if there were Wyres I know not how many times Slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer than a Hair: whether you ſuppoſe them to be Figur'd like Needles, or Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrically, like the Hairs of a Bruſh, with Hemiſphaerical (or at leaſt Convex) Tops, they will be ſo very Slender, and conſequently the Points both of the one ſort and the other ſo very Sharp, that even an exquiſite Touch will be able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh no greater Difference between them, than that which our Blind man allow'd, when comparing Black and White Bodies, he ſaid, that the latter was the leſs Rough of the two. Nor is every Kind of Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though Senſible enough, Inconſiſtent with Whiteneſs, there being Caſes, wherein the Phyſical Superficies of a Body is made by the ſame Operation both <hi>Rough</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> as when the Level Surface of clear Water being by agitation Aſperated with a multitude of Unequal Bubbles, do's thereby acquire a Whiteneſs; and as a Smooth piece of Glaſs, by being Scratch'd with a Diamond, do's in the Aſperated part of its Surface diſcloſe the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. But more (perchance) of this elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. And therefore, we ſhall here paſs by the Queſtion, whether any thing might
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56394:46"/>
be conſider'd about the Opacity of the Corpuſcles of Black Pigments, and the <hi>Comparative</hi> Diaphanëity of thoſe of many White Bodies, apply'd to our preſent Caſe; and proceed, to repreſent, That the newly mention'd Exiguity and Shape of the extant Particles being ſuppos'd, it will then be conſiderable what we lately but Hinted, (and therefore muſt now ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Explane) That the Depth of the little Cavities, intercepted between the extant Particles, without being ſo much greater in Black Bodies than in White ones, as to be perceptibly ſo to the Groſs Organs of Touch, may be very much greater in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their Diſpoſition of Reflecting the imaginary ſubtile Beams of Light. For in Black Bodies, thoſe Little intercepted Cavities, and other Depreſſions, may be ſo Figur'd, ſo Narrow and ſo Deep, that the incident Beams of Light, which the more extant Parts of the Phyſical Superficies are diſpos'd to Reflect inwards, may be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd there, and prove unable to Emerge; whilſt in a White Body, the Slender Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles may not only by their Figure be fitted to Reflect the Light copiouſly outwards, but the intercepted Cavities being not Deep, nor perhaps very Narrow, the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of them may be ſo Conſtituted, 'as to

be fit to Reflect outwards much of the Light that falls even upon Them; as you may poſſibly better apprehend, when we ſhall come to treat of Whiteneſs and Blackneſs. In the mean time it may ſuffice, that you take Notice with me, that the Blind mans Relations import no neceſſity of Concluding, that, though, becauſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Judgment of his Touch, Black was the Rougheſt, as it is the Darkeſt of Colours, therefore White, which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to us) is the Lighteſt, ſhould be alſo the Smootheſt: ſince I obſerve, that he makes Yellow to be two Degrees more Aſperous than Blew, and as much leſs Aſperous than Green; whereas indeed, Yellow do's not only appear to the Eye a Lighter Colour than Blew, but (by our firſt Experiment hereafter to be mention'd) it will appear, that Yellow reflected much more Light than Blew, and manifeſtly more than Green, (which we need not much wonder at, ſince in this Colour and the two others (Blew and Yellow) 'tis not <hi>only</hi> the <hi>Reflected Light</hi> that is to be conſidered, ſince to produce both theſe, <hi>Refraction</hi> ſeems to Intervene, which by its Varieties may much alter the Caſe:) which both ſeems to ſtrengthen the Conjecture I was formerly propoſing, that there was ſomething elſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56394:47"/>
in the <hi>Kinds</hi> of Aſperity, as well as in the <hi>Degrees</hi> of it, which enabled our Blind man to Diſcriminate Colours, and do's at leaſt ſhow, that we cannot in all Caſes from the bare Difference in the Degrees of Aſperity betwixt Colours, ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Rougher of any two always Reflects the leaſt Light.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. But this notwithſtanding, <hi>(Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus)</hi> and what ever Curioſity I may have had to move ſome Queſtions to our Sagacious Blind man, yet thus much I think you will admit us to have gain'd by his Teſtimony, that ſince many Colours may be felt with the Circumſtances above related, the Surfaces of ſuch Coloured Bodies muſt certainly have differing <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi> and in all probability have differing <hi>Forms</hi> or Kinds of Aſperity belonging to them, which is all the Uſe that my preſent attempt obliges me to make of the Hiſtory above deliver'd, that being ſufficient to prove, <hi>that</hi> Colour do's much depend upon the Diſpoſition of the Superficial parts of Bodies, and to ſhew in general, <hi>wherein</hi> 'tis probable that ſuch a Diſpoſition do's (principally at leaſt) conſiſt.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. But to return to what I was ſaying before I began to make mention of our Blind <hi>Organiſt,</hi> what we have deliver'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56394:48"/>
touching the cauſes of the ſeveral Forms of Aſperity that may Diverſifie the Surfaces of Colour'd Bodies, may perchance ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what aſſiſt us to make ſome Conjectures in the general, at ſeveral of the ways whereby 'tis poſſible for the Experiments hereafter to be mention'd, to produce the ſuddain changes of Colours that are wont to be Conſequent upon them; for moſt of theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> being produc'd by the Intervention of Liquors, and theſe for the moſt part abounding with very Minute, Active, and Variouſly Figur'd Saline Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, Liquors ſo Qualify'd may well enough very Nimbly alter the Texture of the Body they are imploy'd to Work upon, and ſo may change the form of Aſperity, and thereby make them Remit to the Eye the Light that falls on them, after another manner than they did before, and by that means Vary the Colour, ſo farr forth as it depends upon the Texture or Diſpoſition of the Seen Parts of the Object, which I ſay, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that you may not think I would abſolutely exclude all other ways of Modifying the Beams of Light between their Parting from the Lucid Body, and their Reception into the common Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Now there ſeen to me divers ways,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56394:48"/>
by which we may conceive that Liquors may Nimbly alter the Colour of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of other Bodies, upon which they Act, but my preſent haſte will allow me to mention but ſome of them, without Inſiſting ſo much as upon thoſe I ſhall name.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. And firſt, the Minute Corpuſcles that compoſe a Liquor may eaſily inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate themſelves into thoſe Pores of Bodies, whereto their Size and Figure makes them Congruous, and theſe Pores they may either exactly Fill, or but Inadequately, and in this latter Caſe they will for the moſt part alter the Number and Figure, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Bigneſs of the former Pores. And in what capacity ſoever theſe Corpuſcles of a Liquor come to be Lodg'd or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd in the Pores that admit them, the Surface of the Body will for the moſt part have its Aſperity alter'd, and the Incident Light that meets with a Groſſer Liquor in the little Cavities that before contain'd nothing but Air, or ſome yet Subtiler Fluid, will have its Beams either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted, or Imbib'd, or elſe Reflected more or leſs Interruptedly, than they would be, if the Body had been Unmoiſtned, as we ſee, that even fair Water falling on white Paper, or Linnen, and divers other Bodies
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56394:49"/>
apt to ſoak it in, will for ſome ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as thoſe newly mention'd, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately alter the Colour of them, and for the moſt part make it Sadder than that of the Unwetted Parts of the ſame Bodies. And ſo you may ſee, that when in the Summer the High-ways are Dry and Duſty, if there falls ſtore of Rain, they will quickly appear of a much Darker Colour than they did before, and if a Drop of Oyl be let fall upon a Sheet of White Paper, that part of it, which by the Imbibition of the Liquor acquires a greater Continuity, and ſome Tranſparency, will appear much Darker than the reſt, many of the Incident Beams of Light being now Tranſmitted, that otherwiſe would be Reflected towards the Beholders Eyes.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. Secondly, A Liquor may alter the Colour of a Body by freeing it from thoſe things that hindred it from appearing in its Genuine Colour; and though this may be ſaid to be rather a Reſtauration of a Body to its own Colour, or a Retection of its native Colour, than a Change, yet ſtill there Intervenes in it a change of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour which the Body appear'd to be of before this Operation. And ſuch a change a Liquor may work, either by Diſſolving, or Corroding, or by ſome ſuch way of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56394:49"/>
carrying off that Matter, which either Veil'd or Diſguis'd the Colour that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appears. Thus we reſtore Old pieces of Dirty Gold to a clean and nitid Yellow, by putting them into the Fire, and into <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> which take off the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious Filth that made that pure Metall look of a Dirty Colour. And there is alſo an eaſie way to reſtore Silver Coyns to their due Luſtre, by fetching off that which Diſcolour'd them. And I know a <hi>Chymical</hi> Liquor, which I employ'd to reſtore pieces of Cloath ſpotted with Greaſe to their proper Colour, by Imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Spotted part with this Liquor, which Incorporating with the Greaſe, and yet being of a very Volatile Nature, does eaſily carry it away with it Self. And I have ſometimes try'd, that by Rubbing upon a good Touch-ſtone a certain <hi>Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> mixture ſo Compounded, that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion it left upon the Stone appear'd of a very differing Colour from that of Gold, yet a little of <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> would in a Trice make the Golden Colour diſcloſe it ſelf, by Diſſolving the other <hi>Metalline</hi> Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that conceal'd thoſe of the Gold, which you know that <hi>Menstruum</hi> will leave Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. Thirdly, A Liquor may alter the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56394:50"/>
Colour of a Body by making a Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of its Parts, and that principally two ways, the firſt by Disjoyning and Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating thoſe Cluſters of Particles, if I may ſo call them, which ſtuck more Looſely together, being faſtned only by ſome more eaſily Diſſoluble Ciment, which ſeems to be the Caſe of ſome of the following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where you'l find the Colour of many Corpuſcles brought to cohere by having been Precipitated together, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by the Affuſion of very peircing and inciſive Liquors. The other of the two ways I was ſpeaking of, is, by Dividing the Groſſer and more Solid Particles into Minute ones, which will be always Leſſer, and for the moſt part otherwiſe Shap'd than the Entire Corpuſcle ſo Divided, as it will happen in a piece of Wood reduc'd into Splinters or Chips, or as when a piece of Chryſtal heated red Hot and quench'd in Cold water is crack'd into a multitude of little Fragments, which though they fall not aſunder, alter the Diſpoſition of the Body of the Chryſtal, as to its manner of Reflecting the Light, as we ſhall have Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew hereafter.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. There is a fourth way contrary to the third, whereby a Liquor may change the Colour of another Body, eſpecially of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56394:50"/>
another Fluid, and that is, by procuring the Coalition of ſeveral Particles that before lay too Scatter'd and Diſpers'd to exhibit the Colour that afterwards appears. Thus ſometimes when I have had a Solution of Gold ſo Dilated, that I doubted whether the Liquor had really Imbib'd any true Gold or no, by pouring in a little <hi>Mercury,</hi> I have been quickly able to ſatisfie my Self, that the Liquor contain'd Gold, that Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall after a little while Cloathing the Surface of the <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> with a Thin Film of its own Livery. And chiefly, though not only by this way of bringing the Minute parts of Bodies together in ſuch Numbers as to make them become Notorious to the Eye, many of theſe Colours ſeem to be Generated which are produc'd by Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, eſpecially by ſuch as are wont to be made with fair Water, as when Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Gumms diſſolv'd in Spirit of Wine, are let fall again, if the Spirit be Copiouſly diluted with that weakning Liquor. And ſo out of the Rectify'd and Tranſparent Butter of <hi>Antimony,</hi> by the bare Mixture of fair Water, there will be plentifully Precipitated that Milk-white Subſtance, which by having its Looſer Salts well waſh'd off, is turn'd into that Medicine, which Vulgar <hi>Chymiſts</hi> are pleas'd to call <hi>Mercurius Vitae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="23">
                           <pb n="60" facs="tcp:56394:51"/>
23. A fifth way, by which a Liquor may change the Colour of a Body, is, by Diſlocating the Parts, and putting them out of their former Order into another, and perhaps alſo altering the Poſture of the ſingle Corpuſcles as well as their Order or Situation in reſpect of one another. What certain Kinds of Commotion or Diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Parts of a Body may do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Changing its Colour, is not only evident in the Mutations of Colour obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> and ſome other Concretes long kept by <hi>Chymiſts</hi> in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Heat, though in cloſe Veſſels, but in the Obvious Degenerations of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which every Body may take notice of in Bruis'd Cherries, and other Fruit, by comparing after a while the Colour of the Injur'd with that of the Sound part of the ſame Fruit. And that alſo ſuch Liquors, as we have been ſpeaking of, may greatly Diſcompoſe the Textures of many Bodies, and thereby alter the Diſpoſition of their Superficial parts, the great Commotion made in Metalls, and ſeveral other Bodies by <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and other Saline <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> may eaſily perſwade us, and what ſuch Vary'd Situations of Parts may do towards the Diverſifying of the manner of their Reflecting the Light, may
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56394:51"/>
be Gueſs'd in ſome Meaſure by the Beating of Tranſparent Glaſs into a White Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but farr better by the Experiments lately Pointed at, and hereafter Deliver'd, as the Producing and Deſtroying Colours by the means of ſubtil Saline Liquors, by whoſe Affuſion the Parts of other Liquors are manifeſtly both Agitated, and likewiſe Diſpos'd after another manner than they were before ſuch Affuſion. And in ſome <hi>Chymical</hi> Oyls, as particularly that of Lemmon Pills, by barely Shaking the Glaſs, that holds it, into Bubbles, that Tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Parts which is conſequent to the Shaking, will ſhew you on the Surfaces of the Bubbles exceeding Orient and Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Colours, which when the Bubbles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into the reſt of the Oyl, do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Vaniſh.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. I know not, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> whether I ſhould mention as a Diſtinct way, becauſe it is of a ſomewhat more General Nature, that Power, whereby a Liquor may alter the Colour of another Body, by putting the Parts of it into Motion; For though poſſibly the Motion ſo produc'd, does, as ſuch, ſeldome ſuddenly change the Colour of the Body whoſe Parts are Agitated, yet this ſeems to be one of the moſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, however not Immediate cauſes of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56394:52"/>
the Quick change of Colours in Bodies. For the Parts being put into Motion by the adventitious Liquor, divers of them that were before United, may become thereby Disjoyn'd, and when that Motion ceaſes or decays, others of them may Stick toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that in a new Order, by which means the Motion may ſometimes produce Permanent changes of Colours, as in the Experiment you will meet with hereafter, of preſently turning a Snowy White Body into a Yellow, by the bare Affuſion of fair Water, which probably ſo Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the Saline Corpuſcles that remain'd in the <hi>Calx,</hi> and ſets them at Liberty to Act upon one another, and the Metall, far more Powerfully than the Water without the Aſſiſtance of ſuch Saline Corpuſcles could do. And though you rubb Blew <hi>Vitriol,</hi> how Venereal and Unſophiſticated ſoever it be, upon the Whetted Blade of a Knife, it will not impart to the Iron its Latent Colour, but if you moiſten the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> with your Spittle, or common Water, the Particles of the Liquor disjoyning thoſe of the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and thereby giving them the Various Agitation requiſite to Fluid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the Metalline Corpuſcles of the thus Diſſolv'd <hi>Vitriol</hi> will Lodge themſelves in Throngs in the Small and Congruous
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56394:52"/>
Pores of the Iron they are Rubb'd on, and ſo give the Surface of it the Genuine Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Copper.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. There remains yet a way, <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> to be mention'd, by which a Liquor may alter the Colour of another Body, and this ſeems the moſt Important of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though it be nam'd but as One, yet it may indeed comprehend Many, and that is, by Aſſociating the Saline Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or any other Sort of the more Rigid ones of the Liquor, with the Particles of the Body that it is employ'd to Work upon. For theſe Adventitious Corpuſcles Aſſociating themſelves with the Protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berant Particles of the Surface of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd Body, muſt neceſſarily alter their Bigneſs, and will moſt commonly alter their Shape. And how much the Colours of Bodies depend upon the Bulk and Figure of their Superficial Particles, you may Gueſs by this, that eminent antient <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,</hi> and divers <hi>Moderns,</hi> have thought that all Colours might in a general way be made out by theſe two; whoſe being Diverſify'd, will in our Caſe be attended with theſe two Circumſtances, the One, that the Protuberant Particles being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd in Bulk, they will oftentimes be Vary'd as to the Cloſeneſs or Laxity of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56394:53"/>
their Order, fewer of them being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd within the ſame Senſible (though Minute) ſpace than before; or elſe by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to one another, they muſt Straighten the Pores, and it may be too, they will by their manner of Aſſociating themſelves with the Protuberant Particles, intercept new Pores. And this invites me to conſider farther, that the Adventitious Corpuſcles, I have been ſpeaking of, may likewiſe produce a great Change as well in the Little Cavities or Pores as in the Protuberances of a Colour'd Body; for beſides what we have juſt now taken notice of, they may by Lodging themſelves in thoſe little Cavities, fill them up, and it may well happen, that they may not only fill the Pores they Inſinuate themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but likewiſe have their Upper Parts extant above them; and partly by theſe new Protuberances, partly by Increaſing the Bulk of the former, theſe Extraneous Corpuſcles may much alter the Number and Bigneſs of the Surfaces Pores, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Old and Intercepting new ones. And then 'tis Odds, but the Order of the Little Extancies, and conſequently that of the Little Depreſſions in point of Situation will be alter'd likewiſe: as if you diſſolve <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> in ſome kind of <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi>
                           <pb n="65" facs="tcp:56394:53"/>
the Saline Particles of the <hi>Menstruum,</hi> Aſſociating themſelves with the Mercurial Corpuſcles, will make a Green Solution, which afterwards eaſily enough Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. And Red Lead or <hi>Minium</hi> being Diſſolv'd in Spirit of Vinegar, yields not a Red, but a Clear Solution, the Redneſs of the Lead being by the Liquor Deſtroy'd. But a better Inſtance may be taken from Copper, for I have try'd, that if upon a Copper-plate you let ſome Drops of weak <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> reſt for a while, the Corpuſcles of the <hi>Menstruum</hi> joyning with thoſe of the Metall, will produce a very ſenſible Aſperity upon the Surface of the Plate, and will Concoagulate that way into very minute Grains of a Pale Blew <hi>Vitriol;</hi> whereas if upon another part of the ſame Plate you ſuffer a little ſtrong Spirit of Urine to reſt a competent time, you ſhall find the Aſperated Surface adorn'd with a Deeper and Richer Blew. And the ſame <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> that will quickly change the Redneſs of Red Lead into a Darker Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, will, being put upon Crude Lead, produce a Whitiſh Subſtance, as with Copper it did a Blewiſh. And as with Iron it will produce a Reddiſh, and on White Quills a Yellowiſh, ſo much may the Coalition of the Parts of the ſame
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56394:54"/>
Liquor, with the differingly Figur'd Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Stable Bodies, divers ways Aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the differingly Diſpos'd Surfaces, and ſo Diverſifie the Colour of thoſe Bodies. And you'l eaſily believe, that in many changes of Colour, that happen upon the Diſſolutions of Metalls, and Precipitations made with Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and the like Fix'd Salts, there may Intervene a Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of Saline Corpuſcles with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Body Diſſolv'd or Precipitated, if you examine how much the <hi>Vitriol</hi> of a Metall may be Heavier than the Metalline part of it alone, upon the Score of the Saline parts Concoagulated therewith, and, that in ſeveral Precipitations the weight of the <hi>Calx</hi> does for the ſame Reaſon much exceed that of the Metall, when it was firſt put in to be Diſſolv'd.</p>
                        <p n="26">26. But, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to conſider theſe Matters more particularly would be to forget that I declar'd againſt Adventuring, at leaſt for this time, at particular Theories of Colours, and that accordingly you may juſtly expect from me rather Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than Speculations, and therefore I ſhall Diſmiſs this Subject of the Forms of Superficial Aſperity in Colour'd Bodies, as ſoon as I ſhall but have nam'd to you by way of Supplement to what we have
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56394:54"/>
hitherto Diſcours'd in this Section, a Couple of Particulars, (which you'l eaſily grant me) The one, That there are divers other ways for the ſpeedy Production even of True and Permanent Colours in Bodies, beſides thoſe Practicable by the help of Liquors; for proof of which Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though ſeveral Examples might be alleged, yet I ſhall need but Re-mind you of what I mention'd to you above, touching the change of Colours ſuddenly made on Temper'd Steel, and on Lead, by the Operation of Heat, without the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a Liquor. But the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular I am to obſerve to you is of more Importance to our preſent Subject, and it is, That though Nature and Art may in ſome caſes ſo change the Aſperity of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial parts of a Body, as to change its Colour by either of the ways I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Single or Unaſſiſted, yet for the moſt part 'tis by two or three, or perhaps by more of the fore-mention'd ways Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated together, that the Effect is produc'd, and if you conſider how Variouſly thoſe ſeveral ways and ſome others Ally'd unto them, which I have left unmention'd, may be Compounded and Apply'd, you will not much wonder that ſuch fruitfull, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Principles (or Manners of, Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification)
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56394:55"/>
ſhould be fitted to Change or Generate no ſmall ſtore of Differing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. Hitherto, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> we have in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of the Aſperity of Bodies conſider'd the little Protuberances of other Superficial particles which make up that Roughneſs, as if we took it for granted, that they muſt be perfectly Opacous and Impenetrable by the Beams of Light, and ſo, muſt contribute to the Variety of Colours as they terminate more or leſs Light, and reflect it to the Eye mix'd with more or leſs of thus or thus mingl'd Shades. But to deal Ingenuouſly with you, <hi>Pyrophilns,</hi> before I proceed any further, I muſt not conceal from you, that I have often thought it worth a Serious Enquiry, whether or no Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Matter, each of them ſingly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, and therefore Small enough to be capable of being ſuch Minute Particles, as the <hi>Atomists</hi> both of old and of late have (not abſurdly) called <hi>Corpuſcula Coloris,</hi> may not yet conſiſt each of them of divers yet Minuter Particles, betwixt which we may conceive little Commiſſures where they Adhere to one another, and, however, may not be Porous enough to be, at leaſt in ſome degree, Pervious to the unimaginably ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Corpuſcles that make up the Beams of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56394:55"/>
Light, and conſequently to be in ſuch a degree Diaphanous. For, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that the propoſed Enquiry may be of moment to him that ſearches after the Nature of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, you'l eaſily grant, if you conſider, that whereas Perfectly Opacous bodies can but reflect the incident Beams of Light, thoſe that are Diaphanous are qualified to refract them too, and that Refraction has ſuch a ſtroak in the Production of Colours, as you cannot but have taken notice of, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps admir'd in the Colours generated by the Trajection of Light through Drops of Water that exhibit a Rain-bow, through Priſmatical glaſſes, and through divers other Tranſparent bodies. But 'tis like, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> you'l more eaſily allow that about this matter 'tis rather Important to have a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, than that 'tis Rational to entertain a Doubt; wherefore I muſt mention to you ſome of the Reaſons that make me think it may need a further Enquiry, for I find that in a Darkned Room, where the Light is permitted to enter but at One hole, the little wandering Particles of Duſt, that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Motes, and, unleſs in the Sun-beams, are not taken notice of by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſiſted Sight, I have, I ſay, often obſerv'd, that theſe roving Corpuſcles being look'd on by an Eye plac'd on one ſide of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56394:56"/>
Beams that enter'd the Little hole, and by the Darkneſs having its Pupill much Enlarg'd, I could diſcern that theſe Motes as ſoon as they came within the compaſs of the Lumihous, whether Cylinder or Inverted Cone, if I may ſo call it, that was made up by the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded Beams of the Sun, did in certain poſitions appear adorn'd with very vivid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, like thoſe of the Rain-bow, or rathen like thoſe of very Minute, but Sparkling frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Diamonds; and as ſoon as the Continuance of their Motion had brought them to an Inconvenient poſition in reference to the Light and the Eye, they were only viſible without Darting any lively Colours as before, which ſeems to argue that theſe little Motes, or minute Fragments, of ſeveral ſorts of bodies reputed Opacous, and only crumbled as to their Exteriour and Looſer parts into Duſt, did not barely Reflect the Beams that fell upon them, but remit them to the Eye Refracted too. We may alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that ſeveral Bodies, (as well ſome of a Vegetable, as others of an Animal nature) which are wont to paſs for Opacous, appear in great part Tranſparent, when they are reduc'd into Thin parts, and held againſt a powerful Light. This I have not only taken notice of in pieces of Ivory reduc'd but into Thick Leaves, as alſo in divers conſiderable
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56394:56"/>
Thick ſhells of Fiſhes, and in ſhaving of Wood, but I have alſo found that a piece of Deal, far thicker than one would eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, being purpoſly interpos'd betwixt my Eye plac'd in a Room, and the clear Day-light, was not only ſomewhat Tranſparent, but (perhaps by reaſon of its Gummous nature) appear'd quite through of a lovely Red. And in the Darkned Room above mention'd, Bodies held againſt the hole at which the Light enter'd, appear'd far leſs Opacous than they would elſewhere have done, inſomuch that I could eaſily and plainly ſee through the whole Thickneſs of my Hand, the Motions of a Body plac'd (at a very near diſtance indeed, but yet) beyond it. And even in Minerals, the Opacity is not always ſo great as many think, if the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be made Thin, for White Marble though of a pretty Thickneſs, being within a Due diſtance plac'd betwixt the Eye and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Light, will ſuffer the Motions of ones Finger to be well diſcern'd through it, and ſo will pieces, Thick enough, of many common Flints. But above all, that Inſtance is remarkable, that is afforded us by <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covie</hi> glaſs, (which ſome call <hi>Selenites,</hi> others <hi>Lapis Specularis)</hi> for though plates of this Mineral, though but of a moderate Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do often appear Opacous, yet if
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56394:57"/>
one of theſe be Dextrouſly ſplit into the thinneſt Leaves 'tis made up of, it will yield ſuch a number of them, as ſcarce any thing but Experience could have perſwaded me, and theſe Leaves will afford the moſt Tranſparent ſort of conſiſtent Bodies, that, for ought I have obſerv'd, are yet known; and a ſingle Leaf or Plate will be ſo far from being Opacous, that 'twill ſcarce be ſo much as Viſible. And multitudes of Bodies there are, whoſe Fragments ſeem Opacous to the naked Eye, which yet, when I have included them in good <hi>Microſcopes,</hi> appear'd Tranſparent; but, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> on the other ſide I am not yet ſure that there are no Bodies, whoſe Minute Particles even in ſuch a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope</hi> as that of mine, which I was lately mentioning, will not appear Diaphanous. For having conſider'd <hi>Mercury</hi> Precipitated <hi>perſe,</hi> the little Granules that made up the powder, look'd like little fragments of Coral beheld by the naked Eye at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (for very Near at hand Coral will ſometimes, eſpecially if it be Good, ſhew ſome Tranſparency.) Filings likewiſe of Steel and Copper, though in an excellent <hi>Microſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope,</hi> and a fair Day, they ſhow'd like pretty Big Fragments of thoſe Metalls, and had conſiderable Brightneſs on ſome of their Surfaces, yet I was not ſatisfi'd, that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56394:57"/>
any Reflection from the Inner parts of any of the Filings. Nay, having look'd in my beſt <hi>Microſcope</hi> upon the Red <hi>Calx</hi> of Lead, (commonly call'd <hi>Minium)</hi> neither I, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I ſhew'd it to, could diſcern it to be other than Opacous, though the Day were Clear, and the Object ſtrongly Enlightned. And the deeply Red Colour of <hi>Vitriol</hi> appear'd in the ſame <hi>Microſcope</hi> (notwithſtanding the great Comminution effected by the Fire) but like Groſſy beaten Brick. So that, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I ſhall willingly reſign you the care of making ſome further Enquiries into the Subject we have now been conſidering; for I confeſs, as I told you before, that I think that the Matter may need a further Scrutiny, nor would I be forward to Determine how far or in what caſes the Tranſparency or Semi-diaphaniety of the Superficial Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of Bigger Bodies, may have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Production of their Colours, eſpecially becauſe that even in divers White bodies, as Beaten Glaſs, Snow and Froth, where it ſeems manifeſt that the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial parts are ſingly Diaphanous, (being either. Water, or Air, or Glaſs) we ſee not that ſuch Variety of Colours are produc'd as uſually are by the Refraction of Light, even in thoſe Bodies, when by their Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Shape, &amp;c. they are conveniently
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56394:58"/>
qualify'd to exhibit ſuch Various and Lively Colours as thoſe of the Rain-bow, and of Priſmatical Glaſſes.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. By what has been hitherto diſcours'd, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> we may be aſſiſted to judge of that famous Controverſie which was of Old diſputed betwixt the <hi>Epicureans</hi> and other <hi>Atomists</hi> on the one ſide, and moſt other <hi>Philoſophers</hi> on the other ſide. The former Denying Bodies to be Colour'd in the Dark, and the Latter making Colour to be an Inherent quality, as well as Figure, Hardneſs; Weight, or the like. For though this Controverſie be Reviv'd, and hotly Agitated among the <hi>Moderns,</hi> yet I doubt whether it be not in great part a Nominal diſpute, and therefore let us, according to the Doctrine formerly deliver'd, Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Acceptions of the word Colour, and ſay, that if it be taken in the Stricter Senſe, the <hi>Epicureans</hi> ſeem to be in the Right, for if Colour be indeed, though not according to them, but Light Modify'd, how can we conceive that it can Subſiſt in the Dark, that is, where it muſt be ſuppos'd there is no Light; but on the other ſide, if Colour be conſider'd as a certain Conſtant Diſpoſition of the Superficial parts of the Object to Trouble the Light they Reflect after ſuch and ſuch a Determinate manner,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56394:58"/>
this Conſtant, and, if I may ſo ſpeak, Modifying diſpoſition perſevering in the Object, whether it be Shin'd upon or no, there ſeems no juſt reaſon to deny, but that in this Senſe, Bodies retain their Colour as well in the Night as Day; or, to Speak a little otherwiſe, it may be ſaid, that Bodies are Potentially Colour'd in the Dark, and Actually in the Light. But of this Matter diſcourſing more fully elſewhere, as 'tis a difficulty that concerns Qualities in general, I ſhall forbear to inſiſt on it here.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. OF greater Moment in the Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Nature of Colours is the Controverſie, Whether thoſe of the Rain-bow, and thoſe that are often ſeen in Clouds, before the Riſing, or after the Setting of the Sun; and in a word, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe other Colours, that are wont to be call'd Emphatical, ought or ought not to be accounted True Colours. I need not tell you that the Negative is the Common Opinion, eſpecially in the Schools, as may appear by that Vulgar diſtinction of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, whereby theſe under Conſideration are term'd Apparent, by way of Oppoſition
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56394:59"/>
to thoſe that in the other Member of the Diſtinction are call'd True or Genuine. This queſtion I ſay ſeems to me of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, upon this Account, that it being commonly Granted, (or however, eaſie enough to be Prov'd) that Emphatical Colours are Light it ſelf Modify'd by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractions chiefly, with a concurrence ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Reflections, and perhaps ſome other Accidents depending on theſe two; if theſe Emphatical Colours be reſolv'd to be Genuine, it will ſeem conſequent, that Colours, or at leaſt divers of them, are but Diverſify'd Light, and not ſuch Real and Inherent qualities as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought to be.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now ſince we are wont to eſteem the Echoes and other Sounds of Bodies, to be True Sounds, all their Odours to be True Odours, and (to be ſhort) ſince we judge other Senſible Qualities to be True ones, becauſe they are the proper Objects of ſome or other of our Senſes, I ſee not why Emphatical Colours, being the proper and peculiar Objects of the Organ of Sight, and capable to Affect it as Truly and as Powerfully as other Colours, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted but Imaginary ones.</p>
                        <p>And if we have (which perchance you'l allow) formerly evinc'd Colour, (when
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56394:59"/>
the word is taken in its more Proper ſenſe) to be but Modify'd Light, there will be ſmall Reaſon to deny theſe to be true Colours, which more manifeſtly than others diſcloſe themſelves to be produc'd by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifications of the Light.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There is indeed taken notice of a Difference betwixt theſe Apparent colours, and thoſe that are wont to be eſteem'd Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, as to the Duration, which has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd ſome Learned Men to call the former rather Evanid than Fantaſtical. But as the Ingenious <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> does ſomewhere Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly obſerve, if this way of Arguing were Good, the Greeneſs of a Leaf ought to paſs for Apparent, becauſe, ſoon Fading into a Yellow, it ſcarce laſts at all, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Greeneſs of an Emerauld. I ſhall add, that if the Sun-beams be in a convenient manner trajected through a Glaſs-priſm, and thrown upon ſome well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaded Object within a Room, the Rain-bow thereby Painted on the Surface of the Body that Terminates the Beams, may oftentimes laſt longer than ſome Colours I have produc'd in certain Bodies, which would juſtly, and without ſcruple be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Genuine Colours, and yet ſuddenly Degenerate, and loſe their Nature.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A greater Diſparity betwixt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56394:60"/>
Colours, and others, may perhaps be taken from this, that Genuine Colours ſeem to be produc'd in Opacous Bodies by Reflection, but Apparent ones in Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Bodies, and principally by Refraction, I ſay Principally rather than Solely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſome caſes Reflection alſo may concurr, but ſtill this ſeems not to conclude theſe Latter Colours not to be True ones. Nor muſt what has been newly ſaid of the Differences of True and Apparent Colours, be interpreted in too Unlimited a Senſe, and therefore it may perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Aſſiſt you, both to Reflect upon the two fore-going Objections, and to judge of ſome other Paſſages which you'l meet with in this Tract, if I take this Occaſion to obſerve to you, that if Water be Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated into Froth, it exhibits you know a White colour, which ſoon after it Loſes upon the Reſolution of the Bubbles into Air and Water, now in this caſe either the Whiteneſs of the Froth is a True Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or not, if it be, then True Colours, ſuppoſing the Water pure and free from Mixtures of any thing Tenacious, may be as Short-liv'd as thoſe of the Rain-bow; alſo the Matter, wherein the Whiteneſs did Reſide, may in a few moments perfectly Loſe all foot-ſteps or remains of it. And
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56394:60"/>
beſides, even Diaphanous Bodies may be capable of exhibiting True Colours by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, for that Whiteneſs is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, we ſhall anon make it probable. But if on the other ſide it be ſaid, that the Whiteneſs of Froth is an Emphatical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, then it muſt no longer be ſaid, that Fantaſtical Colours require a certain Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Luminary and the Eye, and muſt be Vary'd or Deſtroy'd by the Change thereof, ſince Froth appears White, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sun be Riſing or Setting, or in the Meridian, or any where between it and the Horizon, and from what (Neighbouring) place ſoever the Beholders Eye looks upon it. And ſince by making a Liquor Tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enough, yet without Deſtroying its Tranſparency, or Staining it with any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, you may give the Little Films, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Bubbles conſiſt, ſuch a Texture, as may make the Froth laſt very many Hours, if not ſome Days, or even Weeks, it will render it ſomewhat Improper to aſſign Duration for the Diſtinguiſhing Character to Diſcriminate Genuine from Fantaſtical Colours. For ſuch Froth may much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt the Undoubtedly true Colours of ſome of Nature's Productions, as in that Gaudy Plant not undeſervedly call'd the Mervail of <hi>Peru,</hi> the Flowers do often Fade, the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56394:61"/>
ſame Day they are Blown; And I have often ſeen a <hi>Virginian</hi> Flower, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Withers within the compaſs of a Day; and I am credibly Inform'd; that not far from hence a curious Herboriſt has a Plant, whoſe Flowers periſh in about an Hour. But if the Whiteneſs of Water turn'd into Froth muſt therefore be reputed Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, becauſe it appears not that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Body is Alter'd, but only that the Diſpoſition of its Parts in reference to the Incident Light is Chang'd, why may not the Whiteneſs be accounted Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical too, which I ſhall ſhew anon to be Producible, barely by ſuch another change in Black Horn? and yet this ſo eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd Whiteneſs ſeems to be as truly its Colour as the Blackneſs was before, and at leaſt is more Permanent than the Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Leaves, the Redneſs of Roſes, and; in ſhort, than the Genuine Colours of the moſt part of Nature's Productions. It may indeed be further Objected, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Sun or other Luminous Body changes place, theſe Emphatical Colours alter or vaniſh. But not to repeat what I have juſt now ſaid, I ſhall add, that if a piece of Cloath in a Drapers Shop (in ſuch the Light being ſeldome Primary) be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly Folded, it will appear of differing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56394:61"/>
Colours, as the Parts happen to be more Illuminated or more Shaded, and if you ſtretch it Flat, it will commonly exhibit ſome one Uniform Colour, and yet theſe are not wont to be reputed Emphatical, ſo that the Difference ſeems to be chiefly this, that in the Caſe of the Rain-bow, and the like, the Poſition of the Luminary Varies the Colour, and in the Cloath I have been mentioning, the Poſition of the Object does it. Nor am I forward to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that in all Caſes the Apparition of Emphatical Colours requires a Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate poſition of the Eye, for if Men will have the Whiteneſs of Froth Emphatical, you know what we have already Inferr'd from thence. Beſides, the Sun-beams tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected through a Triangular Glaſs, after the manner lately mention'd, will, upon the Body that Terminates them, Paint a Rain-bow, that may be ſeen whether the Eye be plac'd on the Right Hand of it or the Left, or Above or Beneath it, or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or Behind it; and though there may appear ſome Little Variation in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the Rain-bow, beheld from Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parts of the Room, yet ſuch a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity may be alſo obſerv'd by an Attentive Eye in Real Colours, look'd upon under the like Circumſtances. Nor will it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56394:62"/>
that becauſe there remains no Foot-ſteps of the Colour upon the Object, when the Priſm is Remov'd, that therefore the Colour was not Real, ſince the Light was truly Modify'd by the Refraction and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection it Suffer'd in its Trajection through the Priſm; and the Object in our caſe ſerv'd for a Specular Body, to Reflect that Colour to the Eye. And that you may not be Startled, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that I ſhould Venture to ſay, that a Rough and Colour'd Object may ſerve for a <hi>Speculum</hi> to Reflect the Artificial Rain-bow I have been mentioning, conſider what uſually happens in Darkned Rooms, where a Wall, or other Body conveniently Situated within, may ſo Reflect the Colours of Bodies, without the Room, that they may very clearly be Diſcern'd and Diſtinguiſh'd, and yet 'tis taken for granted, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours ſeen in a Darkned Room, though they leave no Traces of themſelves upon the Wall or Body that Receives them, are the True Colours of the External Objects, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with which the Colours of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages are Mov'd or do Reſt. And the Errour is not in the Eye, whoſe Office is only to perceive the Appearances of things, and which does Truly ſo, but in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Eſtimative faculty, which Miſtaking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56394:62"/>
concludes that Colour to belong to the Wall, which does indeed belong to the Object, becauſe the Wall is that from whence the Beams of Light that carry the Viſible <hi>Species,</hi> do come in Straight Lines directly to the Eye, as for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we are wont at a certain Diſtance from Concave Sphaerical Glaſſes, to perſwade our ſelves that we ſee the Image come forth to Meet us, and Hang in the Air betwixt the Glaſs and Us, becauſe the Reflected Beams that Compoſe the Image croſs in that place, where the Image ſeems to be, and thence, and not from the Glaſs, do in Direct Lines take their Courſe to the Eye, and upon the like Cauſe it is, that divers Deceptions in Sounds and other Senſible Objects do depend, as we elſewhere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. I know not, whether I need add, that I have purpoſely Try'd, (as you'l find ſome Pages hence, and will perhaps think ſomewhat ſtrange) that Colours that are call'd Emphatical, becauſe not Inherent in the Bodies in which they Appear, may be Compounded with one another, as thoſe that are confeſſedly Genuine may. But when all this is ſaid, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I muſt Advertiſe you, that it is but Problematically Spoken, and that though I think the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56394:63"/>
I have endeavour'd to fortifie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, yet a great part of our Diſcourſe concerning Colours may be True, whether that Opinion be ſo or not.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="5" type="chapter">

                        <p n="1">1. THere are you know, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> beſides thoſe Obſolete Opinions about Colours which have been long ſince Rejected, very Various Theories that have each of them, even at this day, Eminent Men for its Abetters; for the Peripatetick Schools, though they diſpute amongſt themſelves divers particulars concerning Colours, yet in this they ſeem Unanimouſly enough to Agree, that Colours are Inherent and Real Qualities, which the Light doth but Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe, and not concurr to Produce. Beſides there are <hi>Moderns,</hi> who with a ſlight Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation adopt the Opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> and as he would have Colour to be nothing but a Kind of Flame conſiſting of Minute Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles as it were Darted by the Object againſt the Eye, to whoſe Pores their Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and Figure made them congruous, ſo theſe would have Colour to be an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Light of the more Lucid parts of the Object, Darkned and conſequently Alter'd by the Various Mixtures of the leſs Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56394:63"/>
parts. There are alſo others, who in imitation of ſome of the Antient <hi>Atomiſts,</hi> make Colour not to be Lucid ſteam, but yet a Corporeal <hi>Effluvium</hi> iſſuing out of the Colour'd Body, but the Knowingſt of theſe have of late Reform'd their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, by acknowledging and adding that ſome External Light is neceſſary to Excite, and as <hi>they</hi> ſpeak, Sollicit theſe Corpuſcles of Colour as <hi>they</hi> call them, and Bring them to the Eye. Another and more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Opinion of the <hi>Modern</hi> Philoſophers, to which this laſt nam'd may by a Favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able explication be reconcil'd, is that which derives Colours from the Mixture of Light and Darkneſs, or rather Light and Shadows. And as for the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> 'tis known, that the generality of them aſcribes the Origine of Colours to the Sulphureous Principle in Bodies, though I find, as I elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where largely ſhew, that ſome of the Chiefeſt of them derive Colours rather from Salt than Sulphur, and others, from the third Hypoſtatical Principle, <hi>Mercury.</hi> And as for the <hi>Carteſians</hi> I need not tell you, that they, ſuppoſing the Senſation of Light to bee produc'd by the Impulſe made upon the Organs of Sight, by certain extremely Minute and Solid Globules, to which the Pores of the Air and other Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56394:64"/>
bodies are pervious, endeavour to derive the Varieties of Colours from the Various Proportion of the Direct Progreſs or Motion of theſe Globules to their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolution or Motion about their own Centre, by which Varying Proportion they are by this Hypotheſis ſuppoſ'd qualify'd to ſtrike the Optick Nerve after ſeveral Diſtinct manners, ſo to produce the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Differing Colours.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Beſides theſe ſix principal Hypotheſes, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> there may be ſome others, which though Leſs known, may perhaps as well as theſe deſerve to be taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration by you; but that I ſhould copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly debate any of them at preſent, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume you will not expect, if you conſider the Scope of theſe Papers, and the Brevity I have deſign'd in them, and therefore I ſhall at this time only take notice to you in the general of two or three things that do more peculiarly concern the Treatiſe you have now in your hands.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And firſt, though the Embracers of the ſeveral Hypotheſes I have been naming to you, by undertaking each Sect of them to explicate Colours indefinitely, by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Hypotheſes they maintain, ſeem to hold it forth as the only Needfull Theory about that Subject, yet for my part I doubt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56394:64"/>
whether any one of all theſe Hypotheſes have a right to be admitted Excluſively to all others, for I think it Probable, that Whiteneſs and Blackneſs may be explicated by Reflection alone without Refraction, as you'l find endeavour'd in the Diſcourſe you'l meet with e're long Of the Origine of Whiteneſs and Blackneſs, and on the other ſide, ſince I have not found that by any Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of White and True Black, (for there is a Blewiſh Black which many miſtake for a Genuine) there can be a Blew, a Yellow, or a Red, to name no other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, produced, and ſince we do find that theſe Colours may be produc'd in the Glaſs-priſm and other Tranſparent bodies, by the help of Refractions, it ſeems that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction is to be taken in into the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſome Colours, to whoſe Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they ſeem to concurr, either by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a further or other Commixture of Shades with the Refracted Light, or by ſome other way not now to be diſcours'd. And as it ſeems not improbable, that in caſe the Pores of the Air, and other Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous bodies be every where almoſt fill'd with ſuch <hi>Globuli</hi> as the <hi>Carteſians</hi> ſuppoſe, the Various kind of Motion of theſe <hi>Globuli,</hi> may in many caſes have no ſmall ſtroak in Varying our Perception of Colour, ſo
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56394:65"/>
without the Suppoſition of theſe <hi>Globuli,</hi> which 'tis not ſo eaſie to evince, I think we may probably enough conceive in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that the Eye may be Variouſly affected, not only by the Entire Beams of Light that fall upon it as they are ſuch, but by the Order, and by the Degree of Swiftneſs, and in a word by the Manner according to which the Particles that compoſe each Particular Beam arrive at the Senſory, ſo that whatever be the Figure of the Little Corpuſcles, of which the Beams of Light conſiſt, not only the Celerity or Slowneſs of their Revolution or Rotation in reference to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive Motion, but their more Abſolute Celerity, their Direct or Undulating Motion, and other Accidents, which may attend their Appulſe to the Eye, may fit them to make Differing Impreſſions on it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Secondly, For theſe and the like Conſiderations, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I muſt deſire that you would look upon this little Treatiſe, not as a Diſcourſe written Principally to maintain any of the fore-mention'd Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Excluſively to all others, or ſubſtitute a New one of my Own, but as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Hiſtory of Colours, upon which, when you and your Ingenious friends ſhall have Enrich'd it, a Solid Theory may be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56394:65"/>
ſafely built. But yet becauſe this Hiſtory is not meant barely for a Regiſter of the things recorded in it, but for an <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> to a ſound and comprehenſitive Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, I thought fit, ſo to temper the whole Diſcourſe, as to make it as condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, as conveniently I can to that End, and therefore I have not ſcrupled to let you ſee that I was willing, as to ſave you the labour of Cultivating ſome Theories that I thought would never enable you to reach the Ends you aim at, ſo to contract your Enquiries into a Narrow compaſs, for both which purpoſes I thought it requiſite to do theſe two things, the <hi>One,</hi> to ſet down ſome Experiments which by the help of the Reflections and Inſinuations that attend them, may aſſiſt you to diſcover the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmneſs and Inſufficiency both of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peripatetick Doctrine, and of the now more applauded Theory of the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> about Colour, becauſe theſe two Doctrines having Poſſeſs'd themſelves, the one of the moſt part of the Schools, and the other of the Eſteem of the Generality of Phyſicians and other Learned Men, whoſe Profeſſions and Ways of Study do not exact that they ſhould Scrupulouſly examine the very Firſt and Simpleſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Nature, I fear'd it would be to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56394:66"/>

But, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> though this be at preſent the Hypotheſis I preferr, yet I propoſe it but in a General Senſe, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only that the Beams of Light, Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by the Bodies whence they are ſent (Reflected or Refracted) to the Eye, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce there that Kind of Senſation, Men commonly call Colour; But whether I think this Modification of the Light to be perform'd by Mixing it with Shades, or by Varying the Proportion of the Progreſs and Rotation of the <hi>Carteſian Globuli Caeleſtes,</hi> or by ſome other way which I am not now to mention, I pretend not here to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.

know all that were requiſite to be Known, to give You, or even my Self, a perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Theory of Viſion and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, for in Order to ſuch an undertaking I would firſt Know what Light is, and if it be a Body (as a Body or the Motion of a Body it ſeems to be) what Kind of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles for Size and Shape it conſiſts of, with what Swiftneſs they move Forwards, and Whirl about their own Centres. Then I would Know the Nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction, which I take to be one of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſeſt things (not to explicate Plauſibly, but to explicate Satisfactorily) that I have met with in Phyſicks; I would further Know what Kind and what Degree of Commixture of Darkneſs or Shades is made by Refractions or Reflections, or both, in the Superficial particles of thoſe Bodies, that being Shin'd upon, conſtantly exhibit the one, for Inſtance, a Blew, the other a Yellow, the third a Red Colour; I would further Know why this Contemperation of Light and Shade, that is made, for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by the Skin of a Ripe Cherry, ſhould exhibit a Red, and not a Green, and the Leaf of the ſame Tree ſhould exhibit a Green rather than a Red; and indeed, Laſtly, why ſince the Light that is Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd into theſe Colours conſiſts but of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles

moved againſt the <hi>Retina</hi> or Pith of the Optick Nerve, it ſhould there not barely give a Stroak, but produce a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, whereas a Needle wounding like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Eye, would not produce Colour but Pain. Theſe, and perhaps other things I ſhould think requiſite to be Known, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhould judge my Self to have fully Comprehended the True and Whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Colours; and therefore, though by making the Experiments and Reflections deliver'd in this Paper, I have endeavour'd ſomewhat to Leſſen my Ignorance in this Matter, and think it far more Deſireable to diſcover a Little, than to diſcover Nothing, yet I pretend but to make it Probable by the Experiments I mention, that ſome Colours may be Plauſibly enough Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the General by the Doctrine here propos'd; For whenſoever I would De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the Minute and Accurate Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Particulars, I find my Self very Senſible of the great Obſcurity of things, without excepting thoſe which we never ſee but when they are Enlightned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with <hi>Scaliger, Latet natura haec,</hi> (ſays he, Speaking of that <note place="margin">Exercitat. 325.

3. But though in this paſſage, that very Ingenious Perſon has Anticipated part of what I ſhould ſay; Yet I preſume you will for all that expect, that I ſhould give you a fuller Account of that. Notion of White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I have the leaſt Exceptions to, and of the Particulars whence I deduce it, which to do, I muſt mention to you the following Experiments and Obſervations.</p>
                        <p>Whiteneſs then conſider'd as a Quality in the Object, ſeems chiefly to depend upon this, That the Superficies of the Body that is call'd White, is Aſperated by almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Small Surfaces, which being of an almoſt Specular Nature, are alſo ſo Plac'd, that ſome Looking this way, and ſome that way, they yet Reflect the Rays of Light that fall on them, not towards one another, but outwards towards the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators Eye. In this Rude and General account of Whiteneſs, it ſeems that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe Qualities, which are common to Bodies of other Colours, as for inſtance the Minuteneſs and Number of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial parts, the two chief things attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Bodies as White are made to be, Firſt, that its Little Protuberances and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial parts be of ſomewhat a Specular Nature, that they may as little Looking-glaſſes each of them Reflect the Beams it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56394:69"/>
receives, (or the little Picture of the Sun made on it) without otherwiſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably Altering them; whereas in moſt other Colours, they are wont to be much Chang'd, by being alſo Refracted, or by being Return'd to the Eye, mixt with Shades or otherwiſe. And next, that its Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial parts be ſo Situated, that they Retain not the Incident Rays of Light by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting them Inwards, but Send them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Back, ſo that the Outermoſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of a White Body, having their Various Little Surfaces of a Specular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Man can from no place Behold the Body, but that there will be among thoſe Innumerable <hi>Superficieculae,</hi> that Look ſome one way, and ſome another, enough of them Obverted to his Eye, to afford like a broken Looking-glaſs, a confuſed Idaea, or Repreſentation of Light, and make ſuch an Impreſſion on the Organ, as that for which Men are wont to call a Body White. But this Notion will perhaps be beſt Explan'd by the ſame Experiments and Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, on which it is Built, And therefore I ſhall now advance to <hi>Them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. And in the firſt place I conſider, that the Sun and other Powerfully Lucid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, are not only wont to Offend, which we call to Dazle our Eyes, but that if any
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56394:70"/>
Colour be to be Aſcrib'd to them as they are Lucid, it ſeems it ſhould be White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For the Sun at Noon-day, and in Clear weather, and when his Face is leſs Troubled, and as it were Stained by the Steams of Sublunary Bodies, and when his Beams have much leſs of the Atmoſphere to Traject in their Paſſage to our Eyes, appears of a Colour more approaching to White, than when nearer the Horizon, the Interpoſition of certain Sorts of Fumes and Vapours make him oftentimes appear either Red, or at leaſt more Yellow. And when the Sun Shines upon that Natural Looking-glaſs, a Smooth water, that part of it, which appears to this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Beholder, the moſt Shin'd on, does to his Eye ſeem far Whiter than the reſt. And here I ſhall add, that I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had the Opportunity to obſerve a thing, that may make to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, namely, that when the Sun was Veil'd over as it were, with a Thin White Cloud, and yet was too Bright to be Look'd upon Directly without Dazling, by caſting my Eyes upon a Smooth water, as we ſometimes do to obſerve Eclipſes without prejudice to our Eyes, the Sun then not far from the Meridian, appear'd to me not Red, but ſo White, that 'twas
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56394:70"/>
not without ſome Wonder, that I made the Obſervation. Beſides, though we in <hi>Engliſh</hi> are wont to ſay, a thing is Red hot, as an Expreſſion of its being Superlatively <hi>Ignitum,</hi> (if I may ſo Speak for want of a proper <hi>Engliſh</hi> word) yet in the Forges of Smiths, and the Furnaces of other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, by that which they call a White heat, they mean a further Degree of <hi>Igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> than by that which both they and we call a Red heat.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Secondly, I conſider, that common Experience informs us, that as much Light Over-powers the Eye, ſo when the Ground is covered with Snow, (a Body extremely White) thoſe that have Weak Eyes are wont to complain of too much Light: And even thoſe that have not, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Senſible of an Extraordinary meaſure of Light in the Air; and if they are fain to Look very long upon the Snow, find their Sight Offended by it. On which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion we may call to mind what <hi>Xenophon</hi> relates, that his <hi>Cyrus</hi> marching his Army for divers days through Mountains cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Snow, the Dazling ſplendor of its Whiteneſs prejudic'd the Sight of very many of his Souldiers, and Blinded ſome of them; and other Stories of that Nature may be met with in Writers of good
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56394:71"/>
Note. And the like has been affirm'd to me by credible Perſons of my own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and eſpecially by one who though Skill'd in Phyſick and not Antient confeſs'd to me when I purpoſely ask'd him, that not only during his ſtay in <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi> he found his Eyes much Impair'd, by being reduc'd frequently to Travel in the Snow, but that the Weakneſs of his Eyes did not Leave him when he left that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but has follow'd him into theſe Parts, and yet continues to Trouble him. And to this doth agree what I as well as others have obſerv'd, namely, that when I Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd by Night, when the Ground was all cover'd with Snow, though the Night otherwiſe would not have been Lightſome, yet I could very well ſee to Chooſe my way. But much more Remarkable to my preſent purpoſe is that, which I have met with in <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> concerning the way of Travelling in Winter <note place="margin">Gent. Septen. Hiſtor. lib. 4. cap. 13.</note> in the <hi>Northern</hi> Regions, where the Days of that Seaſon are ſo very Short; for after other things not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be here Tranſcribed: <hi>Iter,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Diurnum duoſcilicet montana milliaria (quae 12 Italica ſunt) conficiunt. Nocte verò ſub ſplendiſſima luna, duplatum iter conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munt aut triplatum. Neque id incommode fit,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56394:71"/>
cum nivium reverberatione lunaris ſplendor ſublimes &amp; declives campos illuſtret, ac etiam montium praecipitia ac noxias feras à longè proſpiciant evitandas.</hi> Which Teſtimony I the leſs Scruple to allege, becauſe that it agrees very well with what has been Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to me by a Phyſician of <hi>Moſco,</hi> whom the Notion I have been Treating of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Whiteneſs invited me to ask whether he could not See much farther when he Travell'd by Night in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> than he could do in <hi>England,</hi> or elſewhere, when there was no Snow upon the Ground; For this Ingenious Perſon inform'd me, that he could See Things at a farr greater Diſtance, and with more Clearneſs, when he Travell'd by Night on the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Snow, though without the Aſſiſtance of Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, than we in theſe Parts would eaſily be perſwaded. Though it ſeems not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to me, that the Intenſeneſs of the Cold may contribute ſomething to the conſiderableneſs of the Effect, by much Clearing the Air of Darkiſh Steams, which in theſe more Temperate Climates are wont to Thicken it in Snowy weather: For having purpoſely inquir'd of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and conſulted that Ingenious Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator Captain <hi>Iames's</hi> Voyage hereafter to be further mention'd, I find both their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56394:72"/>
agree in this, that in Dark Froſty Nights they could Diſcover more Stars, and See the reſt Clearer than we in <hi>England</hi> are wont to do.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. I know indeed that divers Learned Men think, that Snow ſo ſtrongly Affects our Eyes, not by a Borrow'd, but a Native Light; But I venture to give it as a Proof, that White Bodies reflect more Light than Others, becauſe having once purpoſely plac'd a parcel of Snow in a Room care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Darkned, that no Celeſtial Light might come to fall upon it; neither I, nor an ingenious Perſon, (Skill'd in Opticks) whom I deſir'd for a Witneſs, could find; that it had any other Light than what it receiv'd. And however, 'tis uſual among thoſe that Travel in Dark Nights, that the Guides wear ſomething of White to be Diſcern'd by, there being ſcarce any Night ſo Dark, but that in the Free Air there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſome Light, though Broken and Debilitated perhaps by a thouſand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections from the Opacous Corpuſcles that Swim in the Air, and ſend it to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before it comes to arrive at the Eye.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Thirdly, And the better to ſhew that White Bodies reflect ſtore of Light, in compariſon of thoſe that are otherwiſe Colour'd, I did in the Darkn'd Room,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56394:72"/>
formerly mention'd, hold nor far from the Hole, at which the Light was admitted, a Sheet only of White Paper, from whence caſting the Sun-beams upon a White Wall, whereunto it was Obverted, it manifeſtly appear'd both to Me, and to the Perſon I took for a Witneſs of the Experiment, that it Reflected a far greater Light; than any of the other Colours for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mention'd, the Light ſo thrown upon the Wall notably Enlightning it, and by it a good part of the Room. And yet further to ſhew you, that White Bodies Reflect the Beams From them, and not To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards themſelves, Let me add, that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Burning-glaſſes, ſuch as are wont to be employ'd to light Tobacco, will not in a great while Burn, or ſo much as Diſcolour a Sheet of White Paper. Inſomuch that even when I was a Boy, and Lov'd to make Tryals with Burning-glaſſes, I could not but wonder at this Odd <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> which ſet me very Early upon Gueſſing at the Nature of Whiteneſs, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I took notice, that the Image of the Sun upon a White Paper was not ſo well Defin'd (the Light ſeeming too Diffus'd) as upon Black, and becauſe I try'd, that Blacking over the Paper with Ink, not only the Ink would be quickly Dry'd up, but the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56394:73"/>
Paper that I could not Burn before, would be quickly ſet on Fire. I have alſo try'd, that by expoſing my Hand with a Thin Black Glove over it to the Warm Sun; it was thereby very quickly and conſiderably more Heated, than if I took off the Glove, and held my Hand Naked, or put on it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Glove of Thin but White Leather. And having thus ſhewn you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that White Bodies reflect the moſt Light of any, let us now proceed, to conſider what is further to be taken notice of in them, in order to our preſent Enquiry.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. And Fourthly, whereas among the Diſpoſitions we attributed to White Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, we alſo intimated this, That ſuch Bodies are apt, like <hi>Speculums,</hi> though but Imperfect ones, to Reflect the Light that falls on them Untroubled or Unſtain'd, we ſhall beſides other particulars to be met with in theſe Papers, offer you this in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Conjecture; That in the Darkned Room ſeveral times mention'd in this Treatiſe, we try'd that the Sun-beams being caſt from a Coloured Body upon a neighbouring White Wall, the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Colour of the Body was from the Wall reflected to the Eye; whereas we could in divers caſes manifeſtly Alter the Colour arriving at the Eye, by Subſtituting
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56394:73"/>
at a convenient Diſtance, a (conveniently) Colour'd (and Gloſſy) Body inſtead of the White Wall. As by throwing the Beams from a Yellow Body upon a Blew, there would be Exhibited a kind of Green, as in the Experiments about Colours is more fully Declar'd.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. I know not whether I ſhould on this Occaſion take notice, that when, as when looking upon the Calm and Smooth Surface of a River betwixt my Eye and the Sun, it appear'd to be a natural <hi>Speculum,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Part which Reflected to my Eye the Entire and defin'd Image of the Sun, and the Beams leſs remote from thoſe which exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited That Image, appear'd indeed of a great and Whitiſh Brightneſs, but the reſt Comparatively Dark enough: if afterwards the Superficies chanc'd to be a little, but not much troubled, by a gentle Breath of Wind, and thereby reduc'd into a Multitude of Small and Smooth <hi>Speculums,</hi> the Surface of the River would ſuitably to the Doctrine lately deliver'd, at a Diſtance appear very much of Kin to White, though it would loſe that Brightneſs or Whiteneſs upon the Return of the Surface to Calmneſs and an Uniform Level. And I have ſometimes for Tryals ſake brought in by a Lenticular Glaſs, the Image of a River, Shin'd upon
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56394:74"/>
by the Sun, into an Upper Room Darkn'd, and Diſtant about a Quarter of a Mile from the River, by which means the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Declining Surfaces of the Water appear'd ſo Contracted, that upon the Body that receiv'd the Images, the whole River appear'd a very White Object at two or three paces diſtance. But if we drew Near it, this Whiteneſs appear'd to proceed from an Innumerable company of Lucid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, from the ſeveral Gently wav'd Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Water, which look'd Near at hand like a Multitude of very Little, but Shining Scales of Fiſh, of which many did every moment Diſappear, and as many were by the Sun, Wind and River generated anew. But though this Obſervation ſeem'd Sufficiently to diſcover, how the Appearing Whiteneſs in that caſe was Produc'd, yet in ſome other caſes Water may have the Same, though not ſo Vivid a Colour upon other Accounts; for oftentimes it happens that the Smooth Surface of the Water does appear Bright or Whitiſh, by reaſon of the Reflection not immediatly of the Images of the Sun, but of the Brightneſs of the Sky; and in ſuch caſes a Convenient Wind may where it paſſes along make the Surface look Black, by cauſing many ſuch Furrows and Cavities, as may make the Inflected Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56394:74"/>
of the Water reflect the Brightneſs of the Sky rather Inward than Outward. And again, if the Wind increaſe into a Storm, the Water may appear White, eſpecially near the Shore and the Ship, namely becauſe the Rude Agitation Breaks it into Fome or Froth. So much do Whiteneſs and Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depend upon the Diſpoſition of the Superficial parts of a Body to Reflect the Beams of Light Inward or Outward. But that as White Bodies reflect the moſt Light of any, ſo there Superficial Particles are, in the Senſe newly Deliver'd, of a Specular Nature, I ſhall now further endeavour to ſhew both by the making of Specular bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies White, and the making of a White body Specular.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. In the Fifth place then, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form You, that (not to repeat what <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> obſerves concerning Water) I have for Curioſity ſake Diſtill'd Quick-ſilver in a Cucurbit, fitted with a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Glaſs-head, and obſerv'd that when the Operation was perform'd by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Fire requiſite for my purpoſe, there would ſtick to the Inſide of the Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick a multitude of Little round drops of <hi>Mercury.</hi> And as you know that <hi>Mercury</hi> is a Specular Body, ſo each of theſe Little drops was a ſmall round Looking-glaſs,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56394:75"/>
and a Multitude of them lying Thick and Near one another, they did both in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that of thoſe I Invited to ſee it, make the Glaſs they were faſtened to, appear manifeſtly a White Body. And yet as I ſaid, this Whiteneſs depended upon the Minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Nearneſs of the Little Mercurial <hi>Globuli,</hi> the Convexity of whoſe Surfaces fitted them to repreſent in a Narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs a Multitude of Little Lucid Images to differingly ſituated Beholders. And here let me obſerve a thing that ſeems much to countenance the Notion I have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending: namely, that whereas divers parts of the Sky, and eſpecially the Milky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, do to the naked Eye appear White, (as the name it ſelf imports) yet the Galaxie look'd upon through the Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, does not ſhew White, but appears to be made up of a Vaſt multitude of Little Starrs; ſo that a Multitude of Lucid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, if they be ſo Small that they cannot Singly or apart be diſcern'd by the Eye, and if they be ſufficiently Thick ſet by one another, may by their confus'd beams ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the Eye One White Body. And why it is not poſſible, that the like may be done, when a Multitude of Bright and Little Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles being crowded together, are made to ſend together Vivid beams to the Eye,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56394:75"/>
though they Shine but as the Planets by a Borrow'd Light?</p>
                        <p n="11">11. But to return to our Experiments. We may take notice, That the White of an Egg, though in part Tranſparent, yet by its power of Reflecting ſome Incident Rays of Light, is in ſome meaſure a Natural <hi>Speculum,</hi> being long agitated with a Whisk or Spoon, loſes its Tranſparency, and becomes very White, by being turn'd into Froth, that is into an Aggregate of Numerous ſmall Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, whoſe Convex Superficies fits them to Reflect the Light every way Outwards. And 'tis worth Noting, that when Water, for inſtance, is Agitated into Froth, if the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles be Great and Few, the Whiteneſs will be but Faint, becauſe the number of <hi>Specula</hi> within a Narrow compaſs is but Small, and they are not Thick ſet enough to Reflect ſo Many Little Images or Beams of the Lucid Body, as are requiſite to produce a Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Senſation of Whiteneſs: And partly leaſt it ſhould be ſaid, that the Whiteneſs of ſuch Globulous Particles proceeds from the Air Included in the Froth; (which to make good, it ſhould be prov'd that the Air it ſelf is White) and partly to illuſtrate the better the Notion we have propos'd of Whiteneſs, I ſhall add, that I purpoſely made this Experiment, I took a quantity
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56394:76"/>
Fair water, &amp; put to it in a clear Glaſs phial, a convenient quantity of Oyl or Spirit of Turpentine, becauſe that Liquor will not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate with Water, and yet is almoſt as Clear and Colourleſs as it; theſe being Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Shaken together, the Agitation breaks the Oyl (which as I ſaid, is Indiſpos'd to Mix like Wine or Milk <hi>per minima</hi> with the Water) into a Multitude of Little Globes, which each of them Reflecting Outwards a Lucid Image, make the Imperfect Mixture of the two Liquors appear Whitiſh; but if by Vehemently Shaking the Glaſs for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent time you make a further Comminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Oyl into far more Numerous and Smaller <hi>Globuli,</hi> and thereby confound it alſo better with the Water, the Mixture will appear of a Much greater Whiteneſs, and almoſt like Milk; whereas if the Glaſs be a while let alone, the Colour will by degrees Impair, as the Oyly globes grow Fewer and Bigger, and at length will quite Vaniſh, leaving both the Liquors Diſtinct and Diaphanous as before. And ſuch a Tryal hath not ill ſucceeded, when inſteed of the Colourleſs Oyl of Turpentine I took a Yellow Mixture made of a good Proportion of Crude Turpentine diſſolv'd in that Liquor; and (if I miſ-remember not) it alſo ſucceeded better than one would
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56394:76"/>
expect, when I employ'd an Oyl brought by Filings of Copper infuſed in it, to a deep Green. And this (by the way) may be the Reaſon, why often times when the Oyls of ſome Spices and of Anniſeeds &amp;c. are Diſtilled in a Limbec with Water, the Water (as I have ſeveral times obſerv'd) comes over Whitiſh, and will perhaps continue ſo for a good while, becauſe if the Fire be made too Strong, the ſubtile Chymical Oyl is thereby much Agitated and Broken, and Blended with the Water in ſuch Numerous and Minute Globules, as cannot eaſily in a ſhort time Emerge to the Top of the Water, and whilſt they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in it, make it, for the Reaſon new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated, look Whitiſh; and perhaps upon the ſame Ground a cauſe may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, why Hot water is obſerv'd to be uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more Opacous and Whitiſh, than the ſame Water Cold, the Agitation turning the more Spirituous or otherwiſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently Diſpos'd Particles of the Water into Vapours, thereby Producing in the Body of the Liquor a Multitude of Small Bubbles, which interrupt the Free paſſage, that the Beams of Light would elſe have Every way, and from the Innermoſt parts of the Water Reflect many of them Outwards. Theſe and the like Examples, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi>
                           <pb n="112" facs="tcp:56394:77"/>
have induc'd me to Suſpect, that the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Particles of White bodies, may for the Moſt part be as well Convex as Smooth; I content my ſelf to ſay <hi>Suſpect</hi> and <hi>for the moſt part,</hi> becauſe it ſeems not Eaſie to prove, that when Diaphanous bodies, as we ſhall ſee by and by, are reduc'd into White Powders, each Corpuſcle muſt needs be of a Convex Superficies, ſince perhaps it may Suffice that Specular Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces look ſeverally ways. For (as we have ſeen) when a Diaphanous Body comes to be reduc'd to very Minute parts, it thereby requires a Multitude of Little Surfaces within a Narrow compaſs. And though each of theſe ſhould not be of a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure Convenient to Reflect a Round Image of the Sun, yet even from ſuch an Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently Figur'd body, there may be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected ſome (either Streight or Crooked) Phyſical Line of Light, which Line I call Phyſical, becauſe it has ſome Breadth in it, and in which Line in many caſes ſome Refraction of the Light falling upon the Body it depends on, may contribute to the Brightneſs, as if a Slender Wire; or Solid Cylinder of Glaſs be expos'd to the Light, you ſhall ſee in ſome part of it a vivid Line of Light, and if we were able to draw out and lay together a Multitude of theſe Little
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56394:77"/>
Wires or Thrids of Glaſs, ſo Slender, that the Eye could not diſcern a Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Luminous Lines, there is little doubt (as far as I can gueſs by a Tryal purpoſely made with very Slender, but far leſs Slender Thrids of Glaſs, whoſe Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate was Look'd upon one way White) but the whole Phyſical Superficies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of them, would to the Eye appear White, and if ſo, it will not be always neceſſary that the Figure of thoſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, that make a Body appear White, ſhould be <hi>Globulous.</hi> And as for Snow it ſelf, though the Learned <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> (as we have ſeen above) makes it to ſeem nothing elſe but a pure Frozen Froth, conſiſting of exceedingly Minute and Thick ſet Bubbles; yet I ſee no neceſſity of Admitting that, ſince not only by the Variouſly and Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Figur'd Snow, that I have divers times had the Opportunity with Pleaſure to obſerve, but alſo by the Common Snow, it rather doth appear both to the Naked Eye, and in a <hi>Microſcope,</hi> often, if not moſt commonly, to conſiſt principally of Little Slender Icicles of ſeveral Shapes, which afford ſuch Numerous Lines of Light, as we have been newly Speaking of.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Sixthly, If you take a Diaphanous Body, as for inſtance a Piece of Glaſs, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56394:78"/>
reduce it to Powder, the ſame Body, which when it was Entire, freely Tranſmitted the Beams of Light, acquiring by Contuſion a multitude of Minute Surfaces, each of which is as it were a Little, but Imperfect <hi>Speculum,</hi> is qualify'd to Reflect in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd manner, ſo many either Beams, or Little and Singly Unobſervable Images of the Lucid Body, that from a Diaphanous it Degenerates into a White Body. And I remember, I have for Trials ſake taken Lumps of Rock Cryſtal, and Heating them Red hot in a Crucible, I found ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Expectation, that being Quench'd in Fair water, even thoſe that remain'd in ſeemingly entire Lumps, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd their Tranſlucency for Whiteneſs, the Ignition and Extinction having as it were Crack'd each Lump into a multitude of Minute Bodies, and thereby given it a great multitude of new Surfaces. And ev'n with Diaphanous Bodies, that are Colour'd, there may be this way a Greater Degree of Whiteneſs produc'd, than one would lightly think; as I remember, I have by Contuſion obtain'd Whitiſh Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Granates,</hi> Glaſs of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and <hi>Emeralds</hi> finely Beaten, and you may more eaſily make the Experiment, by taking Good Venereal <hi>Vitriol</hi> of a Deep Blew,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56394:78"/>
and comparing with ſome of the Entire Cryſtalls purpoſely reſerv'd, ſome of the Subtile Powder of the ſame Salt, which will Comparatively exhibit a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable degree of Whitiſhneſs.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Seventhly; And as by a Change of Poſition in the Parts, a Body that is not White, may be made White, ſo by a Slight change of the Texture of its Surface, a White Body may be Depriv'd of its Whiteneſs. For if, (as I have try'd in Gold-ſmiths Shops) you take a piece of Silver that has been freſhly Boyl'd, as the Artificers call it, (which is done by, firſt Bruſhing, and then Decocting it with Salt and Tartar, and perhaps ſome other Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients) you ſhall find it to be of a Lovely White. But if you take a piece of Smooth Steel, and therewith Burniſh a part of it, which may be preſently done; you ſhall find that Part will Loſe its Whiteneſs, and turn a <hi>Speculum,</hi> looking almoſt every where Dark, as other Looking-glaſſes do, which may not a little confirm our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For by this we may gueſs, what it is chiefly that made the Body White be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by conſidering that all that was done to deprive it of that Whiteneſs, was only to Depreſs the Little Protuberances that were before on the Surface of the Silver
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56394:79"/>
into one Continu'd Superficies, and thereby effect this, that now the Image of the Lucid Body, and conſequently a Kind of Whiteneſs ſhall appear to your Eye; but in ſome place of the greater Silver Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs (whence the Beams reflected at an Angle Equal to that wherewith they fall on it, may reach your Eye) whilſt the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity remain'd Undeſtroy'd, the Light falling on innumerable Little <hi>Specula</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſome one way, and ſome another, did from all Senſibly Diſtinguiſhable parts of the Superficies reflect confus'd Beams or Repreſentations of Light to the Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Eye, from whence ſoever he chance to Look upon it. And among the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments annex'd to this Diſcourſe, you will find One, wherein by the Change of Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Bodies, Whiteneſs is in a Trice both Generated and Deſtroy'd.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="2" type="chapter">

                        <p n="1">1. WHat we have Diſcours'd of Whiteneſs, may ſomewhat Aſſiſt us to form a Notion of Blackneſs, thoſe two Qualities being Contrary enough to Illuſtrate each other. Yet among the Antient <hi>Philoſophers</hi> I find leſs Aſſiſtance
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56394:79"/>
to form a Notion of Blackneſs than of Whiteneſs, only <hi>Democritus</hi> in the paſſage above Recited out of <hi>Aristotle</hi> has given a General Hint of the Cauſe of this Colour, by referring the Blackneſs of Bodies to their Aſperity. But this I call but a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hint, becauſe thoſe Bodies that are Green, and Purple, and Blew, ſeem to be ſo as well as Black ones, upon the Account of their Superficial Aſperity. But among the <hi>Moderns,</hi> the formerly mention'd <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendus,</hi> perhaps invited by this Hint of <hi>Democritus,</hi> has Incidentally in another E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle given us, though a very Short, yet a ſomewhat Clearer account of the Nature of Blackneſs in theſe words: <hi>Existimare par est corpora ſuâpte Naturâ nigra constare ex particulis, quarum Superficieculae ſcabrae ſint, nec facilè lucem extrorſum reflectant.</hi> I wiſh this Ingenious Man had enlarg'd himſelf upon this Subject; For indeed it ſeems, that as that which makes a Body White, is chiefly ſuch a Diſpoſition of its Parts, that it Reflects (I mean without much Interruption) more of the Light that falls on it, than Bodies of any other Colour do, ſo that which makes a Body Black is principally a Peculiar kind of Texture, chiefly of its Superficial Particles, whereby it does as it were Dead the Light
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56394:80"/>
that falls on it, ſo that very little is Reflected Outwards to the Eye.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And this Texture may be Explicated two, and perhaps more than two ſeveral ways, whereof the firſt is by Suppoſing in the Superficies of the Black Body a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular kind of Aſperity, whereby the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Particles reflect but Few of the incident Beams Outwards, and the reſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards the Body it ſelf. As if for Inſtance, we ſhould conceive the Surface of a Black Body to be Aſperated by an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Numberleſs throng of Little Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Pyramids, Cones, and other ſuch Corpuſcles, which by their being Thick Set and <hi>Erected,</hi> reflect the Beams of Light from one to another Inwards, and ſend them too and fro ſo often, that at length they are Loſt, before they can come to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound out again to the Eye. And this is the firſt of the two mention'd ways of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating Blackneſs. The other way is by Suppoſing the Texture of Black Bodies to be ſuch, that either by their Yielding to the Beams of Light, or upon ſome other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, they do as it were Dead the Beams of Light, and keep them from being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected in any Plenty, or with any Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Vigour of Motion, Outwards. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Notion it may be ſaid, that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56394:80"/>
the Corpuſcles that make up the Beams of Light, whether they be Solary <hi>Effluviums,</hi> or Minute Particles of ſome Aetherial Subſtance, Thruſting on one another from the Lucid Body, do, falling on Black Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, meet with ſuch a Texture, that ſuch Bodies receive Into themſelves, and Retain almoſt all the Motion communicated to them by the Corpuſcles that make up the Beams of Light, and conſequently Reflect but Few of them, or thoſe but Languidly, towards the Eye, it happening here almoſt in like manner as to a Ball, which thrown againſt a Stone or Floor, would Rebound a great way Upwards, but Rebounds very Little or not at all, when it is thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Water, or Mud, or a Looſe Not, becauſe the Parts yield, and receive into themſelves the Motion, on whoſe Account the Ball ſhould be Reflected Outwards. But this Laſt way of Explicating Blackneſs, I ſhall content my Self to have Propos'd, without either Adopting it, or abſolutely Rejecting it. For the Hardneſs of Touch-ſtones, Black Marble, and other Bodies, that being Black are Solid, ſeem to make it ſomewhat Improbable, that ſuch Bodies ſhould be of ſo Yielding a Texture, unleſs we ſhould ſay, that ſome Bodies may be more Diſpos'd to Yield to the Impulſes of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56394:81"/>
the Corpuſcles of Light by reaſon of a Peculiar Texture, than other Bodies, that in other Tryals appear to be Softer than they. But though the Former of theſe two Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Blackneſs be that, by which we ſhall Endeavour to give an Account of it, yet as we ſaid, we ſhall not Abſolutely Reject this Latter, partly becauſe they both Agree in this, that Black Bodies Reflect but Little of the Light that falls on them, and partly becauſe it is not Impoſſible, that in ſome Caſes both the Diſpoſition of the Superficial particles, as to Figure and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and the Yielding of the Body, or ſome of its Parts, may Joyntly, though not in an Equal meaſure concurr to the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of a Body Black. The Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that induc'd me to propoſe this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Blackneſs, as I Explan'd it, are principally theſe:</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Firſt, That as I lately ſaid, White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Blackneſs being generally reputed to be Contrary Qualities, Whiteneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending as I ſaid upon the Diſpoſition of the Parts of a Body to Reflect much Light, it ſeems likely, that Blackneſs may depend upon a Contrary Diſpoſition of the Black Bodies Surface; But upon this I ſhall not Inſiſt.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Next then we ſee, that if a Body of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56394:81"/>
One and the ſame Colour be plac'd, part in the Sun-beams, and part in the Shade, that part which is not Shin'd on will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more of Kin to Blackneſs than the other, from which more Light Rebounds to the Eye; And Dark Colours ſeem the Blacker, the leſs Light they are Look'd upon in, and we think all Things Black in the Dark, when they ſend no Beams to make Impreſſions on our Organs of Sight, ſo that Shadows and Darkneſs are near of Kin, and Shaddow we know is but a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Light, and accordingly Blackneſs ſeems to proceed from the Paucity of Beams Reflected from the Black Body to the Eye, I ſay the Paucity of Beams, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Bodies that we call Black, as Marble, Jeat, &amp;c. are Short of being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſo, elſe we ſhould not See them at all. But though the Beams that fall on the Sides of thoſe Erected Particles that we have been mentioning, do Few of them return Outwards, yet thoſe that fall upon the Points of thoſe Cylinders, Cones, or Pyramids, may thence Rebound to the Eye, though they make there but a Faint Impreſſion, becauſe they Arrive not there, but Mingl'd with a great Proportion of Little Shades. This may be Confirm'd by my having procur'd a Large piece of Black
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56394:82"/>
Marble well Poliſh'd, and brought to the Form of a Large Sphaerical and Concave <hi>Speculum;</hi> For on the Inſide this Marble being well Poliſh'd, was a kind of Dark Looking-glaſs, wherein I could plainly ſee a Little Image of the Sun, when that Shin'd upon it. But this Image was very far from Offending and Dazling my Eyes, as it would have done from another <hi>Speculum;</hi> Nor, though the <hi>Speculum</hi> were Large, could I in a Long time, or in a Hot Sun ſet a piece of Wood on Fire, though a far leſs <hi>Speculum</hi> of the ſame Form, and of a more Reflecting Matter, would have made it Flame in a Trice.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And on this Occaſion we may as well in Reference to ſomething formerly deliver'd concerning Whiteneſs, as in Reference to what has been newly ſaid, Subjoyn what we further obſerv'd touching the Differing Reflections of Light from White and Black Marble, namely, that having taking a pretty Large Mortar of White Marble, New and Poliſh'd in the Inſide, and Expos'd it to the Sun, we found that it Reflected a great deal of Glaring Light, but ſo Diſpers'd, that we could not make the Reflected Beams concurr in any ſuch Conſpicuous <hi>Focus,</hi> as that newly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of in the Black Marble, though
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56394:82"/>
perhaps there may enough of them be made to meet near the Bottom, to make ſome Kind of <hi>Focus,</hi> eſpecially ſince by holding in the Night-time a Candle at a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Diſtance, we were able to procure a Concourſe of ſome, though not many of the Reflected Beams, at about two Inches diſtant from the Bottom of the Mortar: But we found the Heat even of the Sun-beams ſo Diſperſedly Reflected to be very Lanquid, even in Compariſon of the Black Marbles <hi>Focus.</hi> And the Little Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Sun, that appear'd upon the White Marble as a <hi>Speculum,</hi> was but very Faint and exceeding ill Defin'd. Secondly, That taking two pieces of Plain and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd Surfaces, and caſting on them Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively the Beams of the ſame Candle, in ſuch manner, as that the Neighbouring Superficies being Shaded by an Opacous and Perforated Body, the Incident Beams were permitted to paſs but through a Round Hole of about Half an Inch Diameter, the Circle of Light that appear'd on the White Marble was in Compariſon very Bright, but very ill Defin'd; whereas that on the Black Marble was far leſs Luminous, but much more preciſely Defin'd.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Thirdly, When you Look upon a piece of Linnen that has Small Holes in it,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56394:83"/>
thoſe Holes appear very Black, and Men are often deceiv'd in taking Holes for Spots of Ink; And Painters to repreſent Holes, make uſe of Black, the Reaſon of which ſeems to be, that the Beams that fall on thoſe Holes, fall into them ſo Deep, that none of them is Reflected back to the Eye. And in narrow Wells part of the Mouth ſeems Black, becauſe the Incident Beams are Reflected Downwards from one ſide to another, till they can no more Rebound to the Eye.</p>
                        <p>We may conſider too, that if Differing parts of the ſame piece of Black Velvet be ſtroak'd Oppoſite ways, the piece of Velvet will appear of two Diſtinct kinds of Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the one far Darker than the other, of which Diſparity the Reaſon ſeems to be, that in the Leſs obſcure part of the Velvet, the Little Silken Piles whereof 'tis made up, being Inclin'd, there is a Greater part of each of them Obverted to the Eye, whereas in the other part the Piles of Silk being more Erected, there are far Fewer Beams Reflected Outwards from the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral parts of each Pile, ſo that moſt of thoſe that Rebound to the Eye, come from the Tops of the Piles, which make but a Small part of the whole Superficies, that may be cover'd by the piece of Velvet.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56394:83"/>
Which Explication I propoſe, not that I think the Blackneſs of the Velvet proceeds from the Cauſe aſſign'd, ſince each Single Pile of Silk is Black by reaſon of its Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in what Poſition ſoever you Look upon it; But that the Greater Blackneſs of one of theſe Tuffts ſeems to proceed from the Greater Paucity of Beams Reflected from it, and that from the Fewneſs of thoſe Parts of a Surface that Reflect Beams, and the Multitude of thoſe Shaded Parts that Reflect none. And I remember, that I have oftentimes obſerv'd, that the Poſition of Particular Bodies far greater than Piles of Silk in reference to the Eye, may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their having each of them a Colour of its own, make one part of their Aggregate appear far Darker than the other; For I have near Great Towns often taken notice, that a Cart-load of Carrots pack'd up, appear'd of a much Darker Colour when Look'd upon, where the Points of the Carrots were Obverted to the Eye, than where the Sides of them were ſo.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Fourthly, In a Darkned Room, I purpoſely obſerv'd, that if the Sun-beams, which came in at the Hole were receiv'd upon White or any other Colour, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to a Convenient place of the Room,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56394:84"/>
they would Manifeſtly, though not all Equally, Encreaſe the Light of that Part; whereas if we Subſtituted, either a piece of Black Cloth or Black Velvet, it would ſo Dead the Incident Beams, that the place (newly mention'd) whereto I Obverted the Black Body, would be Leſs Enlightned than it was before, when it received its Light but from the Weak and Oblique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of the Floor and Walls of a pretty Large Room, through which the Beams that came in at the Hole were Confuſedly and Brokenly Diſpers'd.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Fifthly, And to ſhew that the Beams that fall on Black Bodies, as they do not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound Outwards to the Eye, ſo they are Reflected towards the Body it ſelf, as the Nature of thoſe Erected Particles, to which we have imputed Blackneſs, requires, we will add an Experiment that will alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our Doctrine touching Whiteneſs; Namely, that we took a Broad and Large Tile, and having Whitened over one half of the Superficies of it, and Black'd the other, we expos'd it to the Summer Sun; And having let it lye there a convenient time (for the Difference is more Apparent, if it have not lain there too long) we found, as we expected, that whilſt the Whited part of the Tile remained Cool enough, the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56394:84"/>
Black'd part of the ſame Tile was grown not only Senſible, but very Hot, (ſometimes to a ſtrong Degree.) And to ſatisfie ſome of our Friends the more, we have ſometimes left upon the Surface of the Tile, beſides the White and Black parts thereof, a part that Retain'd the native Red of the Tile it ſelf, and Expoſing them to the Sun, we obſerv'd this Laſt mention'd to have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a Heat in compariſon of the White, but a Heat Inferiour to that of the Black, of which the Reaſon ſeems to be, that the Superficial Particles of Black Bodies, being, as we ſaid, more Erected, than thoſe of White or Red ones, the Corpuſcles of Light falling on their ſides, being for the moſt part Reflected Inwards from one Particle to another, and thereby engag'd as it were and kept from Rebounding Upwards, they communicate their brisk Motion, wherewith they were impell'd againſt the Black Body, (upon whoſe account had they fallen upon a White Body, they would have been Reflected Outwards) to the Small parts of the Black Body, and thereby Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in thoſe Small parts ſuch an Agitation, as (when we feel it) we are wont to call Heat. I have been lately inform'd, that an Obſervation near of Kin to Ours, has been made by ſome Learned Men in <hi>France</hi> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56394:85"/>
                           <hi>Italy,</hi> by long Expoſing to a very Hot Sun, two pieces of Marble, the one White, the other Black; But though the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be worthy of them, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the ſame Truth with Our Experiment, yet beſides that our Tryal needs not the Summer, nor any Great Heat to ſucceed, It ſeems to have this Advantage above the other, that whereas Bodies more Solid, and of a Cloſer Texture, though they uſe to be more Slowly Heated, are wont to receive a Greater Degree of Heat from the Sun or Fire, than <hi>(Caeteris paribus)</hi> Bodies of a Slightet Texture; I have found by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Stone-cutters, and by other ways of Enquiry, that Black Marble is much Solider and Harder than White, ſo that poſſibly the Difference betwixt the Degrees of Heat they receive from the Sun-beams will by many be aſcrib'd to the Difference of their Texture, rather than to that of their Colour, though I think our Experiment will make it Probable enough that the greater part of that Difference may well be aſcrib'd to that Diſpoſition of Parts, which makes the one Reflect the Sun-beams Inward, and the other Outwards. And with this Doctrine accords very well, that Rooms hung with Black, are not only Darker than elſe they would be, but are
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56394:85"/>
wont to be Warmer too; Inſomuch that I have known a great Lady, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was ſomewhat Tender, complain that ſhe was wont to catch Cold, when ſhe went out into the Air, after having made any long Viſits to Perſons, whoſe Rooms were hung with Black. And this is not the only Lady I have heard complain of the Warmth of ſuch Rooms, which though perhaps it may be partly imputed to the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of thoſe Materials wherewith the hangings were Dy'd, yet probably the Warmth of ſuch Rooms depends chiefly upon the ſame Cauſe that the Darkneſs does; As (not to repeat what I formerly Noted touching my Gloves,) to ſatisfie ſome Curious Perſons of that Sex, I have convinc'd them, by Tryall, that of two Pieces of Silken Stuff given me by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and expos'd in their Preſence, to the ſame Window, Shin'd onby that Sun, the White was <hi>conſiderably</hi> Heated, when the Black was not ſo much as <hi>Senſibly</hi> ſo.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Sixthly, I remember, that Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Day a <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> of Unſuſpected Credit, that had Viſited Hot Countries, with part of what I have here Deliver'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Blackneſs, he Related to me by way of Confirmation of it, a very notable
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56394:86"/>
Experiment, which he had both Seen others make, and Made himſelf in a Warm Climate, namely, that having carefully Black'd over Eggs, and Expos'd them to the Hot Sun, they were thereby in no very Long time well Roaſted, to which Effect I conceive the Heat of the Climate muſt have Concurr'd with the Diſpoſition of the Black Surface to Reflect the Sun-beams Inward, for I remember, that having made that among other Tryals in <hi>England,</hi> though in Summer-time, the Eggs I Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, acquir'd indeed a conſiderable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Heat, but yet not ſo Intenſe a One, as prov'd ſufficient to Roaſt them.</p>

Seventhly, and Laſtly, Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures at the Nature of Blackneſs may be ſomewhat Confirm'd by the (formerly mention'd) Obſervation of the Blind <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> that Diſcerns Colours with his Fingers; for he ſays, that he Feels a greater Roughneſs upon the Surfaces of Black Bodies, than upon thoſe of Red, or Yellow, or Green.

to be diſcuſſ'd, and grow pretty Cleer and Tranſparent, loſing its Inky Blackneſs, which you may again reſtore to it by the affuſion of a ſmall quantity of a very ſtrong Solution of Salt of Tartar. And though neither of theſe Atramentous liquors will ſeem other than very Pale Ink, if you write with a clean Pen dipt in them, yet that is common to them with ſome ſorts of Ink that prove ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good when Dry, as I have alſo found, that when I made theſe carefully, what I wrote with either of them, eſpecially with the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, would when throughly Dry grow Black enough not to appear bad Ink. This Experiment of taking away and reſtoring Blackneſs from and to the liquors, we have likewiſe tryed in Common Ink; but there it ſucceeds not ſo well, and but very ſlowly, by reaſon that the Gum wont to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the making it, does by its Tenacity oppoſe the operations of the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Saline liquors. But to conſider Gum no more, what ſome kind of Praecipitation may have to do in the producing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of Inks without it, I have elſewhere given you ſome occaſion and aſſiſtance to enquire; But I muſt not now ſtay to do ſo my ſelf, only I ſhall take notice to you, that though it be taken for granted that bodies will not be Praecipitated by Alcaliz at Salts,

that have not firſt been diſſolved in ſome Acid <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> yet I have found upon tryals, which my conjectures lead me to make on purpoſe, That divers Vegetables <hi>barely infus'd,</hi> or, <hi>but ſlightly decocted in common water,</hi> would, upon the affuſion of a Strong and Cleer <hi>Lixivium</hi> of Potaſhes, and much more of ſome other Praecipitating liquors that I ſometimes employ, afford good ſtore of a Crudled matter, ſuch as I have had in the Praecipitations of Vegetable ſubſtances, by the intervention of Acid things, and that this matter was eaſily ſeparable from the reſt of the liquor, being left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind by it in the Filtre; and in making the firſt Ink mention'd in this Experiment, I found that I could by Filtration ſeparate pretty ſtore of a very Black pulverable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that remain'd in the Filtre, and when the Ink was made Cleer again by the Oyl of Vitriol, the affuſion of diſſolv'd <hi>Sal Tartari</hi> ſeem'd but to Praecipitate, and thereby to Unite and render Conſpicuous the particles of the Black mixture that had before been diſpers'd into very Minute and ſingly Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible particles by the Inciſive and reſolving power of the highly Corroſive Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.</p>

                        <p>If pieces of White Harts-horn be with a competent degree of fire diſtill'd in a Glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retort, they will, after the avolation of the Flegm, Spirit, Volatile Salt, and the looſer and lighter parts of the Oleagenous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, remain behind of a Cole-black colour. And even Ivory it ſelf being skilfully Burnt (how I am wont to do it, I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſet down) affords Painters one of the beſt and deepeſt Blacks they have, and yet in the Inſtance of diſtill'd Harts-horn, the operation being made in Glaſs-veſſels carefully clos'd, it appears there is no Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Black ſubſtance that Inſinuates it ſelf into White Harts-horn, and thereby makes it turn Black; but that the Whiteneſs is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, and the Blackneſs generated, only by a Change of Texture, made in the burnt Body, by the Receſs of ſome parts and the Tranſpoſition of others. And though I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not that in many Diſtillations of Harts-horn I ever found the <hi>Cap. Mort.</hi> to paſs from Black to a true Whiteneſs, whilſt it continu'd in Clos'd veſſels, yet having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out the Cole-black fragments, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd them in Open veſſels, I could in few hours quite deſtroy that Blackneſs, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56394:90"/>
ſenſibly changing their Bulk or Figure, reduce them to great Whiteneſs. So much do theſe two Colours depend upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the little parts, that the Bodies wherein they are to be met with do conſiſt of. And we find, that if Whitewine Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, or even the white Cryſtalls of ſuch Tartar be burnt without being truly Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd, the <hi>Cap. Mortuum</hi> (as the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts call the more Fixt part) will be Black. But if you further continue the Calcination till you have perfectly Incinerated the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, &amp; kept it long enough in a Strong fire, the remaining <hi>Calx</hi> will be White. And ſo we ſee that not only other Vegetable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but even White woods, as the Hazel, will yield a Black Charcoal, and afterwards Whitiſh aſhes; And ſo Animal ſubſtances naturally White, as Bones and Eggſhels, will grow Black upon the being Burnt, and White again when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Calcin'd.</p>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56394:91"/>
it: For I have found that by burning Alablaſter, ſo as both to make it appear to boyl almoſt like Milk, and to reduce it to a very fine Powder, it would not at all grow Black, but retain its Pure and Native Whiteneſs, and though by keeping it lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than is uſual in the fire, I produc'd but a faint Yellow, even in that part of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that lay neareſt the top of the Crucible, yet having purpoſely enquired of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd Stone-cutter, who is Curious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in trying Concluſions in his own Trade, he told me he had found that if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lablaſter or Plaiſter of Paris be very long kept in a Strong fire, the whole heap of burnt Powder would exchange its Whiteneſs for a much deeper Colour than the Yellow I obſerv'd. Lead being Calcin'd with a Strong fire turns (after having perhaps run tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough divers other Colours) into <hi>Minium,</hi> whoſe Colour we know is a deep Red; and if you urge this <hi>Minium,</hi> as I have purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done with a Strong fire, you may much eaſier find a Glaſſie and Brittle Body dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker than <hi>Minium,</hi> than any white <hi>Calx</hi> or Glaſs. 'Tis known among Chymiſts, that the white <hi>Calx</hi> of Antimony, by the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and more vehement operation of the fire may be melted into Glaſs, which we have obtain'd of a Red Colour, which is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56394:91"/>
far deeper than that of the <hi>Calx</hi> of Burnt Antimony, and though common Glaſs of Antimony being uſually Adulterated with <hi>Borax,</hi> have its Colour thereby diluted, oftentimes to a very pale Yellow; yet not onely ours made more ſincerily, was, as we ſaid, of a Colour leſs remote from Black, than was the <hi>Calx;</hi> but we obſerv'd, that by Melting it once or twice more, and ſo expoſing it to the further operation of the Fire, we had, as we expected, the Colour heightned. To which we ſhall add but this one Inſtance, (which is worth the taking notice of in Reference to Colours:) That, if you take Blew, but Unſophiſticated, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, and burn it very Slowly, and with a Gentle degree of Heat, you may obſerve, that when 'tis Burnt but a Little, and yet ſo far as that you may rub it to Powder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your fingers, it will be of a White or Whitiſh Colour; But if you Proſecute the Calcination, this Body which by a light Aduſtion was made White, will paſs through other Colours, as Gray, Yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and Red; and if you further burn it with a Long and Vehement fire, by that time it comes to be <hi>Peruſtum,</hi> it will be of a dark Purple, nearer to Black, not only than the firſt <hi>Calx,</hi> but than the Vitriol before it at all felt the fire. I might add that <hi>Crocus
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56394:92"/>
Martis (per ſe</hi> as they call it) made by the Laſting violence of the Reverberated flames is not ſo near a Kin to White, as the Iron or Steel that afforded it was before its Calcinations; but that I ſuppoſe, theſe Inſtances may ſuffice to ſatisfie you, that Minerals are to be excepted out of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Rule, which perhaps, though it ſeldome fail in ſubſtances belonging to the Vegetable or Animal Kingdome, may yet be Queſtion'd even in ſome of theſe, if that be true, which the Judicious Traveller <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> affirms, that Charcoales made out of the Wood of <hi>Oxycaeder</hi> are White; And I could not find, that though in Retorts Harts-horn and other White Bodies will be Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated by Heat, yet Camphire would not at all loſe its Whiteneſs, though I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely kept it in ſuch a heat, as made it melt and boyl. And to manifeſt, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that Galls are not ſo requiſite as many ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the making Atramentous Liquors, we have ſometimes made the following Experiment, We took dryed Roſe leaves and Decocted them for a while in Fair Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, into two or three ſpoonfulls of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction we ſhook a few drops of a ſtrong and well filtrated Solution of Vitriol (which perhaps had it been Green would have done as well) and immediately the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56394:92"/>
mixture did turn Black, and when into this mixture preſently after it was made, we ſhook a juſt Proportion of <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> we turn'd it from a Black Ink to a deep Red one, which by the affuſion of a little Spirit of Urine may be reduc'd immediately to an Opacous and Blackiſh Colour. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that in the former Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, both the Infuſion of Galls, and the Decoction of Roſes, and the Solution of Copperis employ'd about them, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd each of them with its own Colour, there may be a more noble Experiment of the ſudden production of Blackneſs made by the way mention'd in the Second Section of the Second Part of our Eſſays, for though upon the Confuſion of the two Liquors there mention'd, there do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately emerge a very Black mixture, yet both the Infuſion of <hi>Orpiment</hi> and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>Minium</hi> were before their being joyn'd together, Limpid and Colourleſs.</p>

Take then a little Yellow Wax, ſcraped or thinly ſliced, and putting it into a Colts-head or ſome other Convenient Glaſs, pour to it a pretty deal of Spirit of Wine, and placing the Veſſel in Warm Sand, Encreaſe the Heat by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, till the Spirit of Wine begin to Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or to Boyl a little; and continuing that degree of Fire, if you have put Liquor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, you will quickly have the Wax diſſolv'd, then taking it off the fire, you may either ſuffer it to Cool as haſtily as with Safety to the Glaſs you can, or Pour it whilſt 'tis yet Hot into a Filtre of Paper, and either in the Glaſs where it Cools, or in the Filtre, you will ſoon find the Wax and <hi>Menſtruum</hi> together reduc'd into a White Subſtance, almoſt like Butter, which by letting the Spirit Exhale will ſhrink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a much Leſſer Bulk, but ſtill retaining its Whiteneſs.

                        <p>VVhen we Diſſolve in <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> a mixture of Gold and Silver melted into one Lump, it uſually happens that the Powder of Gold that falls to the bottom, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſſoluble by that <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> will not have its own Yellow, but appear of a Black Colour, though neither the Gold, nor the Silver, nor the <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> did before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt any Blackneſs. And divers Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, when they make Solutions of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals they would Examine, are very Glad, if they ſee a Black Powder Praecipirated to the Bottom, taking it for a Hopefull Sign, that thoſe Particles are of a Golden Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56394:95"/>
which appear in a Colour ſo ordinary to Gold parted from other Metalls by <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> that it is a trouble to the Refiner to Reduce the Praecipitated <hi>Calx</hi> to its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Colour. For though, (as we have try'd,) that may be Quickly enough done by Fire, which will make this Gold look very Gloriouſly (as indeed 'tis at leaſt one of the Beſt wayes that is Practis'd for the Refining of Gold,) yet it requires both Watchfulneſs and Skill, to give it ſuch a Degree of Fire as will ſerve to Reſtore it to its Luſtre, without giving it ſuch a One, as may bring it to Fuſion, to which the Minuteneſs of the <hi>Corpuſcles</hi> it conſiſts of makes the Powder very apt. And this brings into my Mind, that having taken a Flat and Bright piece of Gold, that was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd by a Curious and Skilfull Perſon on purpoſe to Trye to what height of Purity Gold could be brought by Art, I found that this very piece, as Glorious as it look'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rubb'd a little upon a piece of fine clean Linnen, did ſully it with a kind of Black; and the like I have obſerv'd in Refin'd Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which I therefore mention, becauſe I formerly ſuſpected that the Impurity of the Metall might have been the only Cauſe of what I have divers times obſerv'd in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Silver-hilted Swords, Namely, that

where they rubb'd upon my Clothes, if they were of a Light-Colour'd Cloath, the Affriction would quickly Black them; and Congruouſly hereunto I have found Pens Blackt almoſt all over, when I had a while carri'd them about me in a Silver Ink-caſe. To which I ſhall only add, that whereas in theſe ſeveral Inſtances of Denigration, the Metalls are worn off, or otherwiſe Reduc'd into very Minute Parts, that Circumſtance may prove not Unworthy your Notice.</p>

                        <p>That a Solution of Silver does Dye Hair of a Black Colour, is a Known Experiment, which ſome perſons more Curious than Dextrous, have ſo Unluckily made upon themſelves as to make their Friends very Merry. And I remember that the other day, I made my ſelf ſome Sport by an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this Obſervation, for having diſſolv'd ſome Pure Silver in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and Evaporated the <hi>Menſtruum ad ſiccitatem,</hi> as they ſpeak, I caus'd a Quantity of fair Water to be pour'd upon the <hi>Calx</hi> two or three ſeveral times, and to be at each Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, till the <hi>Calx</hi> was very Drye, and all the Greeniſh Blewneſs that is wont to appear in Common Cryſtals of Silver,

was quite carry'd away.

                        <p>The Cauſe of the Blackneſs of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations, which by one common Name we are wont to call <hi>Negroes,</hi> has been long ſince Diſputed of by Learned Men, who poſſibly had not done amiſs, if they had alſo taken into Conſideration, why ſome whole races of other Animals beſides Men, as
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56394:97"/>
Foxes and Hares, are Diſtinguiſh'd by a Blackneſs not familiar to the Generality of Animals of the ſame Species; The General Opinion (to be mention'd a little lower) has been rejected even by ſome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Geographers, and among the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns <hi>Ortelius</hi> and divers other Learned Men have Queſtion'd it. But this is no place to mention what thoughts I have had to and fro about theſe Matters: Only as I ſhall freely Acknowledge, that to me the Enquiry ſeems more Abſtruſe than it does to many others, and that becauſe conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Authors, and with Books of Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and with Travellers, to ſatisfie my ſelf in matters of Fact, I have met with ſome things among them, which ſeem not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree very well with the Notions of the moſt Claſſick Authors concerning theſe things; for it being my Preſent Work to deliver ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters Hiſtorical than Theorys, I ſhall Annex ſome few of my Collections, inſtead of a Solemn Diſputation. It is commonly preſum'd that the Heat of the Climates wherein they live, is the reaſon, why ſo many Inhabitants of the Scorching Regions of <hi>Africa</hi> are Black; and there is this familiar Obſervation to Countenance this Conjecture, That we plainly ſee that Mowers, Reapers, and other Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56394:97"/>
who ſpend the moſt part of the Hot Summer dayes expos'd to the Sun, have the skin of their Hands and Faces, which are the parts immediately Expos'd to the Sun and Air, made of a Darker Colour than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and conſequently tending to Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; And Contrarywiſe we obſerve that the <hi>Danes</hi> and ſome other people that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit Cold Climates, and even the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who feel not ſo Rigorous a Cold, have uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Whiter faces than the <hi>Spaniards, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugalls</hi> and other European Inhabitants of Hotter Climates. But this Argument I take to be far more Specious than Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; for though the Heat of the Sun may Darken the Colour of the Skin, by that Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which we in <hi>Engliſh</hi> call Sun-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet Experience doth not Evince, that I remember, That that Heat alone can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Diſcolouring that ſhall amount to a true Blackneſs, like that of <hi>Negroes,</hi> and we ſhall ſee by and by that even the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſome <hi>Negroes</hi> not yet 10. dayes Old (perhaps not ſo much by three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that time) will notwithſtanding their Infancy be of the ſame Hue with their Parents. Beſides, there is this ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to be alleg'd againſt the Vulgar Opinion, that in divers places in <hi>Aſia</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Parallel, or even of the ſame
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56394:98"/>
Degree of Latitude with the <hi>African</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions Inhabited by Blacks, the People are at moſt but Tawny; And in <hi>Africa</hi> it ſelf divers Nations in the Empire of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> are not <hi>Negroes,</hi>

And though it be true that the <hi>Danes</hi> be a Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter People than the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> yet that may proceed rather from other cauſes (not here to be enquired into) than from the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Climate, ſince not onely the

                           <hi>Swedes</hi> and other Inhabitants of thoſe Cold Countreys, are not uſually ſo White as the <hi>Danes,</hi> nor Whiter than other Nations in proportion to their Vicinity to the Pole. [And ſince the Writing of the former part of this Eſſay, having an opportunity on a Solemn occaſion to take Notice of the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Train of ſome Extraordinary Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours ſent from the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Emperour to a great Monarch, obſerv'd, that (though it were then Winter) the Colour of their Hair and Skin was far leſs Whitiſh than the <hi>Danes</hi> who Inhabit a milder Region is wont to be, but rather for the moſt part of a Darkiſh Brown; And the Phyſician to the Embaſſadour with whom thoſe <hi>Ruſſes</hi> came, being ask'd by me whether in <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi> it ſelf the Generality of the People were more inclin'd to have Dark-colour'd Hair than Flaxen, he anſwer'd Affirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but ſeem'd to ſuſpect that the True and Antient <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> a Sept of whom he told me he had met with in one of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that vaſt Empire, were rather VVhite like the <hi>Danes,</hi> than any thing near ſo Brown as the preſent <hi>Muſcovites</hi> whom he gueſſes to be deſcended of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and to have inherited their Colour from them.] But to Proſecute our former Diſcourſe, I ſhall add for further Proof of the Conjecture I was
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56394:99"/>
countenancing that good Authors inform us that there are <hi>Negroes</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> not far from the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beyond the Southern Tropick, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Torrid Zone, much about the ſame Northern Latitude (or very little more) wherein there are divers <hi>American</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are not <hi>Negroes,</hi> and wherein the Inhabitants of <hi>Candia,</hi> ſome parts of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and even of <hi>Spain</hi> are not ſo much as Tawny-Mores. But (which is a freſh and ſtrong Argument againſt the common Opinion,) I find by our recent Relations of <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (our Accounts whereof we owe to the Curioſity of that Royal <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> the preſent King of <hi>Denmark,)</hi> that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are Olive-colour'd, or rather of a Darker Hiew. But if the Caſe were the ſame with Men, and thoſe other kinds of Animals I formerly nam'd, I ſhould offer ſomething as a conſiderable proof, That, Cold may do much towards the making Men White or Black, and however I ſhall ſet down the Obſervation as I have met with it, as worthy to come into the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Whiteneſs and Blackneſs, and it is, that in ſome parts of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and of <hi>Livonia</hi> it is affirm'd by <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> and others, that Hares and Foxes (ſome add Partrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) which before were Black, or Red, or
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56394:99"/>
Gray, do in the depth of Winter become White by reaſon of the great Cold; (for that it ſhould be, as ſome conceive, by Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Snow, ſeems improbable upon divers accounts) And I remember that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving purpoſely enquir'd of a <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> who lately Travell'd through <hi>Livonia</hi> to <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> concerning the Truth of this Tradition, he both told me, he believ'd it, and added, that he ſaw divers of thoſe lately nam'd Animals either in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> or <hi>Livonia</hi> (for I do not very well remember whether of the two) which, though White when he ſaw them in Winter, they aſſur'd him had been Black, or of other Colours before the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter began, and would be ſo again when it was over. But for further ſatisfaction, I alſo conſulted one that had for ſome years been an Eminent Phyſician in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> who though he rejected ſome other Traditions that are generally enough believ'd concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Countrey, told me nevertheleſs, that he ſaw no cauſe to doubt of this Tradition of <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> as to Foxes and Hares, not onely becauſe 'tis the common and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd Aſſertion of the Natives, but alſo becauſe he himſelf in the Winter could never that he remember'd ſee Foxes and Hares of any other Colour than White; And I my ſelf having ſeen a ſmall White
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56394:100"/>
Fox brought out of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> into <hi>England</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of Winter, foretold thoſe that ſhew'd him me, that he would change Colour in Summer, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coming to look upon him again in <hi>July,</hi> I found that the Back and Sides, together with the upper part of the Head and Tayl were already grown of a Dark Colour, the lower part of the Head and Belly contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet a Whiteneſs. Let me add, that were it not for ſome ſcruple I have, I ſhould think more than what <hi>Olaus</hi> relates,: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the Judicious <hi>Olearius,</hi> who was twice employ'd into thoſe parts as a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſter, who in his Account of <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi> has this Paſſage: <hi>The Hares there are Gray; but in ſome Provinces they grow White in the Winter.</hi> And within ſome few Lines after: <hi>It is not very Difficult to find the Cauſe of this Change, which certainly proceeds only from the Outward Cold, ſince I know that even in Summer, Hares will change Colour, if they be kept a competent time in a Cellar;</hi> I ſay, were it not for ſome Scruple, becauſe I take notice, that in the ſame Page the Author Affirms, that the like change of Colour that happens to Hares in ſome Provinces of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> happens to them alſo in <hi>Livonia,</hi> and yet immediately ſubjoyns, that in <hi>Curland</hi> the Hares vary not their Colour in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56394:100"/>
though theſe two laſt named Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries be contiguous, (that is) ſever'd only by the River of <hi>Dugna;</hi> For it is ſcarce conceivable how Cold alone ſhould have, in Countries ſo near, ſo ſtrangely differing an operation, though no leſs ſtrange a thing is confeſs'd by many, that aſcribe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of <hi>Negroes</hi> to the Heat of the Sun, when they would have the River of <hi>Cenega</hi> ſo to bound the <hi>Moors,</hi> that though on the North-ſide they are but Tawny, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide they are Black.</p>
                        <p>There is another Opinion concerning the Complexion of <hi>Negroes,</hi> that is not only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd by many of the more Vulgar Writers, but likewiſe by that ingenious Traveller Mr. <hi>Sandys,</hi> and by a late moſt learned Critick, beſides other men of Note, and theſe would have the Blackneſs of <hi>Negroes</hi> an effect of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Curſe ratify'd by God's, upon <hi>Cham;</hi> But though I think that even a Naturaliſt may without diſparagement believe all the Miracles atteſted by the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet in this caſe to flye to a Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſe, will, I fear, look like Shifting off the Difficulty, inſtead of Reſolving it; for we enquire not the Firſt and Univerſal, but the Proper, Immediate, and Phyſical Cauſe of the Jetty Colour of <hi>Negroes;</hi> And not only we do not find expreſſed in the

Scripture, that the Curſe meant by <hi>Noah Cham,</hi> was the Blackneſs of his Poſterity, but we do find plainly enough there that the Curſe was quite another thing, namely, that he ſhould be a Servant of ſervants, that is by an Ebraiſm, a very Abject Servant to his Brethren, which accordingly did in part come to paſs, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Sem,</hi> ſubdued the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> that deſcended from <hi>Cham,</hi> and kept them in great Subjection. Nor is it evident that Blackneſs is a Curſe, for Navigators tell us of Black Nations, who think ſo much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of their own condition, that they paint the Devil White. Nor is Blackneſs inconſiſtent with Beauty, which even to our European Eyes conſiſts not ſo much in Colour, as an Advantageous Stature, a Comely Symmetry of the parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Good Features in the Face. So that I ſee not why Blackneſs ſhould be thought ſuch a Curſe to the <hi>Negroes,</hi> unleſs perhaps it be, that being wont to go Naked in thoſe Hot Climates, the Colour of their Skin does probably, according to the Doctrine above deliver'd, make the Sun-beams more Scorching to them, than they would prove to a people of a VVhite Complexion.</p>
                        <p>Greater probability there is, That the Principal Cauſe (for I would not exclude
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56394:102"/>
all concurrent ones) of the Blackneſs of <hi>Negroes</hi> is ſome Peculiar and Seminal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, for not onely we ſee that <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> boyes brought over into theſe Colder Climates loſe not their Colour; But good Authors inform us, That the Off-ſpring of <hi>Negroes</hi> Tranſplanted out of <hi>Africa,</hi> above a hundred years ago, retain ſtill the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of their Progenitors, though poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in Tract of time it will decay; As on the other ſide, the White people removing into very Hot Climates, have their Skins by the Heat of the Sun ſcorch'd into Dark Colours; yet neither they, nor their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have been obſerv'd, even in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of <hi>Negroes,</hi> to deſcend to a Colour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to that of the Natives; whereas I remember I have Read in <hi>Piſos</hi> excellent account of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile,</hi>

And this recalls into my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, what a very Ingenious Phyſician has divers times related to me of a young Lady, to whom being call'd, he found that though
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56394:103"/>
ſhe much complain'd of want of Health, yet there appear'd ſo little cauſe either in her Body, or her Condition to Gueſs that She did any more than fancy her ſelf Sick, that ſcrupling to give her Phyſick, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded her Friends rather to divert her Mind by little Journeys of Pleaſure, in one of which going to Viſit St. <hi>Winifrids</hi> Well, this Lady, who was a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout in her Religion, and a pretty while in the VVater to perform ſome Devotions, and had occaſion to fix her Eyes very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively upon the Red pipple-ſtones, which in a ſcatter'd order made up a good part of thoſe that appear'd through the water, and a while after growing Bigg, ſhe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd of a Child, whoſe VVhite Skin was Copiouſly ſpeckl'd with ſpots of the Colour and Bigneſs of thoſe Stones, and though now this Child have already liv'd ſeveral years, yet ſhe ſtill retains them. I have but two things to add concerning the Blackneſs of <hi>Negroes,</hi> the one is, that the Seat of that Colour ſeems to be but the thin <hi>Epidermes,</hi> or outward Skin, for I knew a young <hi>Negroe,</hi> who having been lightly Sick of the Small Pox or Meaſles, (for it was doubted which of the two vvas his Diſeaſe) I found by enquiry of a perſon that vvas concern'd for him, that in thoſe places the little Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56394:104"/>
that had broke their paſſage through the Skin, when they were gone, they left VVhitiſh ſpecks behind them; And the lately commended <hi>Piſo</hi> aſſures us, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the opportunity in <hi>Braſil</hi> to Diſſect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Negroes,</hi> he cleerly found that their Blackneſs went no deeper than the very out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Skin, which <hi>Cuticula</hi> or <hi>Epiderms</hi> being remov'd, the undermoſt Skin or <hi>Cutis</hi> appear'd juſt as VVhite as that of <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paean</hi> Bodyes. And the like has been affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to me by a Phyſician of our own, whom, hearing he had Diſſected a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groe</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> I conſulted about this particular. The other thing to be here taken notice of concerning <hi>Negroes is,</hi> That having enquir'd of an Intelligent acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of mine (who keeps in the <hi>Indies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 200. of them as well VVomen as Men to work in his Plantations,) whether their Children come Black into the world; he anſwer'd, That they did not, but were brought forth of almoſt the like Reddiſh Colour with our <hi>European</hi> Children; and having further enquir'd, how long it was before theſe Infants appear'd Black, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, that 'twas not wont to be many daies. And agreeable to this account I find that, given us in a freſhly publiſh'd French Book written by a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> that had good oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56394:104"/>
of Knowing the Truth of what he Delivers, for being one of the Miſſionaries of his Order into the Southern <hi>America</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Laudable Deſign of Converting In-ſidels to Chriſtianity, he Baptiz'd ſeveral Infants, which when newly Born, were much of the ſame Colour with <hi>European</hi> Babes, but within about a Week began to appear of the Hue of their Parents. But more Pregnant is the Teſtimony of our Countrey-man <hi>Andrew Battel,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent Priſoner by the <hi>Portugalls</hi> to <hi>Angola,</hi> liv'd there, and in the adjoyning Regions, partly as a Priſoner, partly as a Pilot, and partly as a Souldier, near 18. years, and he mentioning the <hi>African</hi> Kingdom of <hi>Longo,</hi> peopl'd with Blacks, has this paſſage: <hi>The Children in this Countrey are Born White, and change their</hi>

                        <p>The way, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> of producing White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by Chymical Praecipitations is very well worth our obſerving, for thereby Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes of very Differing Colours as well as Natures, though diſſolv'd in Several Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56394:106"/>
are all brought into <hi>Calces</hi> or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that are White. Thus we find that not only Crabs-eyes, that are of themſelves White, and Pearls that are almoſt ſo, but <hi>Coral</hi> and <hi>Minium</hi> that are Red, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in Spirit of Vinegar, may be uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Praecipitated by Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> into White Powders. Thus Silver and Tin ſeparately diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> will the one Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate it ſelf, and the other be Praecipitated by common Salt-water into a White <hi>Calx,</hi> and ſo will Crude Lead and Quickſilver firſt diſſolv'd likewiſe in <hi>Aqua Fortis.</hi> The like <hi>Calx</hi> will be afforded as I have try'd by a Solution of that ſhining Mineral Tinglaſs diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and Praecipitated out of it; and divers of theſe <hi>Calces</hi> may be made at leaſt as Fair and White, if not better Colour'd, if inſtead of Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> they were Praecipitated with Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or with another Liquor I could Name. Nay, that Black Mineral <hi>Antimony</hi> it ſelf, being reduc'd by and with the Salts that concurr to the Compoſition of common Sublimate, into that Cleer though Unctuous Liquor that Chymiſts commonly call Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd Butter of <hi>Antimony,</hi> will by the bare affuſion of ſtore of Fair Water be ſtruck down into that Snow-white Powder, which when the adhering Saltneſs is well waſh'd
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56394:106"/>
off, Chymiſts are pleas'd to call <hi>Mercurius Vitae,</hi> though the like Powder may be made of <hi>Antimony,</hi> without the addition of any <hi>Mercury</hi> at all. And this Lacteſcence if I may ſo call it, does alſo commonly enſue when Spirit of Wine, being Impregnated with thoſe parts of Gums or other Vegetable Concretions, that are ſuppos'd to abound with Sulphureous Corpuſcles, fair Water is ſuddenly pour'd upon the Tincture or Solution. And I remember that very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I did, for Tryal ſake, on a Tincture of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> drawn with Spirit of Wine, and brought to be as Red as Blood, pour ſome fair Water, which preſently mingling with the Liquor, immediately turn'd the whole Mixture White. But if ſuch Seeming Milks be ſuffer'd to ſtand unſtirr'd for a convenient while, they are wont to let fall to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome a Reſinous Subſtance, which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine Diluted and VVeakned by the Water pour'd in it, was unable to ſupport any longer. And ſomething of Kin to this change of Colour in Vegetables is that, which Chymiſts are wont to obſerve upon the pouring of Acid Spirits upon the Red Solution of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> diſſolv'd in an Infuſion of Pot-aſhes, or in ſome other ſharp <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium,</hi> the Praecipitated <hi>Sulphur</hi> before it ſubſides, immediately turning the Red Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56394:107"/>
into a White one. And other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples might be added of this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Whiteneſs in Bodyes by Praecipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them out of the Liquors wherein they have been Diſſolv'd; but I think it may be more uſefull to admoniſh you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that this obſervation admits of Reſtrictions, and is not ſo Univerſal, as by this time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you have begun to think it; For though moſt Praecipitated Bodyes are White, yet I know ſome that are not; For Gold Diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> whether you Praecipitate it with Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> or with Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> will not afford a White but a Yellow <hi>Calx. Mercury</hi> alſo though reduc'd into Sublimate, and Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated with Liquors abounding with Volatile Salts, as the Spirits drawn from Urine, Harts-horn, and other Animal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, yet will afford, as we Noted in our firſt Experiment about Whiteneſs and Blackneſs, a VVhite Praecipitate, yet with the Solution of Pot-aſhes and other Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate Salts, it will let fall an Orange-Taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Powder. And ſo will Crude <hi>Antimony,</hi> if, being diſſolv'd in a ſtrong Lye, you pour (as farr as I remember) any Acid Liquor upon the Solution newly Filtrated, whilſt it is yet Warm. And if upon the Filtrated Solution of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> you pour a Solution of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56394:107"/>
one of theſe fix'd Salts, there will ſubſide a Copious ſubſtance, very farr from having any Whiteneſs, which the Chymiſts are pleas'd to call, how properly I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where examin'd, the <hi>Sulphur of Vitriol.</hi> So that moſt Diſſolv'd Bodyes being by Praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation brought to White Powders, and yet ſome affording Praecipitates of other Colours, the reaſon of both the Phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena may deſerve to be enquir'd into.</p>

                        <p>Some Learned Modern Writers are of Opinion, that the Account upon which VVhiteneſs and Blackneſs ought to be call'd, as they commonly are, the two Extreme Colours, is, <note place="margin">See <hi>Scaliger</hi> Exercit. 325. Sect. 9.</note> That Blackneſs (by which I preſume is meant the Bodyes endow'd with it) receives no other Colours; but VVhiteneſs very eaſily receives them all; whence ſome of them compare VVhite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the <hi>Aristotelian Materia prima,</hi> that being capable of any ſort of Forms, as they ſuppoſe White Bodyes to be of every kind of Colour. But not to Diſpute about Names or Expreſſions, the thing it ſelf that is affirm'd as Matter of Fact, ſeems to be True enough in moſt Caſes, not in all, or ſo,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56394:108"/>
as to hold Univerſally. For though it be a common obſervation among Dyers, That Clothes, which have once been throughly imbu'd with Black, cannot ſo well after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be Dy'd into Lighter Colours, the praeexiſtent Dark Colour infecting the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, that carry the Lighter Colour to be introduc'd, and making it degenerate into ſome more Sad one; Yet the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments lately mention'd may ſhew us, that were the change of Colour in Black Bodies is attempted, not by mingling Bodyes of Lighter Colours with them, but by Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch things as are proper to alter the Texture of thoſe Corpuſcles that contain the Black Colour, 'tis no ſuch difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the lately mention'd Learned Men imagine, to alter the Colour of Black Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes. For we ſaw that Inks of ſeveral Kinds might in a trice be depriv'd of all their Blackneſs; and thoſe made with Log-wood and Red-Roſes might alſo be chang'd, the one into a Red, the other into a Reddiſh Liquor; and with Oyl of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> I have ſometimes turn'd Black pieces of Silk into a kind of Yellow, and though the Taffaty were thereby made Rotten, yet the ſpoyling of that does no way prejudice the Experiment, the change of Black Silk into Yellow, being never the leſs True, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56394:108"/>
the Yellow Silk is the leſs good. And as for Whiteneſs, I think the general affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of its being ſo eaſily Deſtroy'd or Tranſmuted by any other Colour, ought not to be receiv'd without ſome Cautions and Reſtrictions. For whereas, according to what I formerly Noted, Lead is by Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation turned into that Red Powder we call <hi>Minium;</hi> And Tin by Calcination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to a White <hi>Calx,</hi> the common Putty that is ſold and us'd ſo much in Shops, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being, as it is pretended and ought to be, only the <hi>Calx</hi> of Tin, is, by the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers that make it, to ſave the charge of Tin, made, (as ſome of themſelves have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ'd, and as I long ſuſpected by the Cheap rate it may be bought for) but of half Tin and half Lead, if not far more Lead than Tin, and yet the Putty in ſpight of ſo much Lead is a very White Powder, without diſcloſing any mixture of <hi>Minium.</hi> And ſo if you take two parts of Copper, which is a High-colour'd Metall, to but one of Tin, you may by Fuſion bring them into one Maſs, wherein the Whiteneſs of the Tin is much more Conſpicuous and Predominant than the Reddiſhneſs of the Copper. And on this occaſion it may not be Impertinent to mention an Experiment, which I relate upon the Credit of a very Honeſt man,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56394:109"/>
whom I purpoſely enquir'd of about it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf not very fond of making Tryals with <hi>Arſenick,</hi> the Experiment is this, That if you Colliquate <hi>Arſenick</hi> and Copper in a due proportion, the <hi>Arſenick</hi> will Blanch the Copper both within and without, which is an Experiment well enough Known; but when I enquir'd, whether or no this White mixture being skilfully kept a while upon the Cupel would not let go its <hi>Arſenick,</hi> which made Whiteneſs its praedominant Colour, and return to the Reddiſhneſs of Copper, I was aſſur'd of the Affirmative; ſo that among Mineral Bodyes, ſome of thoſe that are White, may be far more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, than thoſe I am reaſoning with ſeem to have known, of Eclipſing others, and of making their Colour Praedominant in Mixtures. In further Confirmation of which may be added, that I remember that I alſo took a lump of Silver and Gold mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, wherein by the Aeſtimate of a very Experienc'd Refiner, there might be about a fourth or third part of Gold, and yet the Yellow Colour of the Gold was ſo hid by the White of the Silver, that the whole Maſs appear'd to be but Silver, and when it was rubb'd upon the Touchſtone, an ordinary beholder could ſcarce have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd it from the Touch of common
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56394:109"/>
Silver; though if I put a little <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> upon any part of the White Surface it had given the Touchſtone, the Silver in the moiſtned part being immediately taken up and conceal'd by the Liquor, the Golden Particles would preſently diſcloſe that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Yellow, and look rather as if Gold, than if the above mention'd mixture, had been rubb'd upon the Stone.</p>

                        <p>I took a piece of Black-horn, (poliſh'd as being part of a Comb) this with a piece of broken glaſs I ſcrap'd into many thin and curdled flakes, ſome ſhorter and ſome lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and having laid a pretty Quantity of theſe ſcrapings together, I found, as I look'd for, that the heap they compos'd was White, and though, if I laid it upon a clean piece of White Paper, its Colour ſeem'd ſomewhat Eclipſ'd by the greater White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Body it was compar'd with, looking ſomewhat like Linnen that had been ſulli'd by a little wearing, yet if I laid it upon a very Black Body, as upon a Beaver Hatt, it then appear'd to be of a good White, which Experiment, that you may in a trice make when you pleaſe, ſeems very much to Disfavour both their Doctrine
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56394:110"/>
that would have Colours to flow from the ſubſtantial Forms of Bodyes, and that of the Chymiſts alſo, who aſcribe them to one of other of their three Hypoſtatical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; for though in our Caſe there was ſo great a Change made, that the ſame Body without being ſubſtantially either Increaſ'd or Leſſened, paſſes immediately from one extreme Colour to another (and that too from Black to White) yet this ſo great and ſudden change is effected by a ſlight Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Tranſpoſition of parts, there being no Salt or <hi>Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi> that can be pretended to be Added or Taken away, nor yet any ſubſtantial Form that can reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſuppos'd to be Generated and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, the Effect proceeding only from a Local Motion of the parts which ſo vary'd their Poſition as to multiply their diſtinct Surfaces, and to Qualifie them to Reflect far more Light to the Eye, than they could before they were ſcrap'd off from the entire piece of Black horn.</p>

                        <p>And now, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> it will not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for us to take ſome notice of an Opinion touching the cauſe of Blackneſs, which I judged not ſo ſeaſonable to Queſtion, till I

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56394:112"/>
I had ſet down ſome of the Experiments, that might juſtifie my diſſent from it. You know that of late divers Learned Men, having adopted the three Hypoſtatical Principles, beſides other Notions of the Chymiſts, are very inclinable to reduce all Qualities of Bodies to one or other of thoſe three Principles, and Particularly aſſign for the cauſe of Blackneſs the Sootie ſteam of <hi>adust</hi> or <hi>Torrifi'd Sulphur.</hi> But I hope that what we have deliver'd above to countenance the Opinion we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd about the Cauſe of Blackneſs, will ſo eaſily ſupply you with ſeveral Particulars that may be made uſe of againſt this Opinion, that I ſhall now repreſent to You but two things concerning it.</p>
                        <p>And Firſt it ſeems that the favourers of the Chymicall Theories might have pitcht upon ſome more proper term, to expreſs the Efficient of Blackneſs than <hi>Sulphur adust;</hi> for we know that <hi>common Sulphur,</hi> not only when Melted, but even when Sublim'd, does not grow Black by ſuffering the Action of the fire, but continues and aſcends Yellow, and rather more than leſs White, than it was before its being expos'd to the fire. And if it be ſet on fire, as when we make that acid Liquor, that Chymiſts call <hi>Oleum Sulphuris per campanam,</hi> it affords
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56394:113"/>
very little Soot, and indeed the flame yeelds ſo little, that it will ſcarce in any degree Black a ſheet of White Paper, held a pretty while over the flame and ſmoak of it, which is obſerved rather to Whiten than Infect linnen, and which does plainly make Red Roſes grow very Pale, but not at all Black, as far as the Smoak is permitted to reach the leaves. And I can ſhew you of a ſort of fixt Sulphur made by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Laborant of your acquaintance, who aſſur'd me that he was wont to keep it for divers weeks together night and day in a naked and Violent fire, almoſt like that of the Glaſs-houſe, and when, to ſatisfie my Curioſity, I made him take out a lump of it, though it were glowing hot (and yet not melted,) it did not, when I had ſuffered it to cool, appear Black, the true Colour of it being a true Red. I know it may be ſaid, that <hi>Chymiſts</hi> in the Opinion above recited mean the <hi>Principle of Sulphur,</hi> and not <hi>common Sulphur</hi> which receives its name, not from its being <hi>all</hi> perfectly of a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Nature, but for that <hi>plenty</hi> and <hi>Predominancy</hi> of the Sulphureous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in it. But allowing this, 'tis eaſie to reply, that ſtill according to this very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, torrifi'd Sulphur ſhould afford more Blackneſs, than moſt other concretes,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56394:113"/>
wherein that Principle is confeſs'd to be far leſs copious. Alſo when I have expos'd Camphire to the fire in Cloſe Veſſels, as Inflamable, and conſequently (according to the Chymiſts) as Sulphureous a Body as it is, I could not by ſuch a degree of Heat, as brought it to Fuſion, and made it Boyl in the glaſs, impreſs any thing of Blackneſs, or of any other Colour, than its own pure White, upon this Vegetable concrete. But what ſhall we ſay to Spirit of Wine, which being made by a Chymical Analyſis of the Liquor that affords it, and being totally Inflamable, ſeems to have a full right to the title they give it of <hi>Sulphur Vegetabile,</hi> &amp; yet this fluid Sulphur not only contracts not any degree of Blackneſs by being often ſo heated, as to be made to Boyl, but when it burns away with an Actual flame, I have not found that it would diſcolour a piece of White Paper held over it, with any diſcernable Soot. Tin alſo, that wants not, according to the Chymiſts, a <hi>Sulphur Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viale,</hi> when throughly burned by the fire into a <hi>Calx,</hi> is not Black, but eminently White. And I lately noted to you out of <hi>Bellonius,</hi> that the Charcoals of Oxy-cedar are not of the former of theſe two Colours, but of the latter. And the Smoak of our Tinby coals here in <hi>England,</hi> has been
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56394:114"/>
uſually obſerv'd, rather to Blanch linnen then to Black it. To all which, other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the like nature might be added, but I rather chooſe to put you in mind of the third Experiment, about making Black Liquors, or Ink, of Bodies that were non of them Black before. For how can it be ſaid, that when thoſe Liquors are put together actually Cold, and continne ſo after their mixture, there intervenes any new <hi>Adustion of Sulphur</hi> to produce the emergent Blackneſs? (and the ſame queſtion will be appliable to the Blackneſs produc'd upon the blade of a Knife, that has cut Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and ſome kind of Sowr apples, if the juyce (though both Actually and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially Cold) be not quickly wip'd of) And when by the inſtilling either of a few drops of Oyl of Vitriol as in the ſecond Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of a little of the Liquor mention'd in the Paſſage pointed at in the fourth Experiment, (where I teach at once to Deſtroy one black Ink, and make another) the Blackneſs produc'd by thoſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is preſently deſtroy'd; if the Colour proceeded only from the Plenty of Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous parts, torrify'd in the Black Bodies, I demand, what becomes of them, when the Colour ſo ſuddenly diſsappears? For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Reaſonably be ſaid, that all thoſe that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56394:114"/>
ſuffic'd to make ſo great a quantity of Black Matter, ſhould reſort to ſo very ſmall a proportion of the Clarifying Liquor, (if I may ſo call it) as to be deluted by it, with out at all Denigrating it. And if it be ſaid that the Inſtill'd Liquor diſpers'd thoſe Black Corpuſcles, I demand, how that Diſperſion comes to deſtroy their Blackneſs, but by making ſuch a Local Motion of their part, as deſtroys their former Texture? which may be a Matter of ſuch moment in caſes like ours, that I remember that I have in few houres, without addition, from Soot it ſelf, attain'd pretty ſtore of Cryſtalline Salt, and good ſtore of Tranſparent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and (which I have on another occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on noted as remarkable) this ſo Black ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance had its Colour ſo alter'd, by the change of Texture it receiv'd from the fire, wherewith it was diſtill'd, that it did for a great while afford ſuch plenty of very white Exhalations, that the Receiver, though large, ſeem'd to be almoſt fill'd with Milk.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, But were it granted, as it is in ſome caſes not Improbable, that divers Bodies may receive a Blackneſs from a Sootie Exhalation<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, occaſion'd by the Aduſtion of their Sulphur, which (for the Reaſons lately mention'd I ſhould rather call their Oyly parts;) yet ſtill this account
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56394:115"/>
is applicable but to ſome Particular Bodies, and will afford us no General Theory of Blackneſs. For if, for example, White Harts-horn, being, in Veſſels well luted to each other, expos'd to the fire, be ſaid to turn Black by the Infection of its own Smoak, I think I may juſtly demand, what it is that makes the Smoak or Soot it ſelf Black, ſince no ſuch Colour, but its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, appear'd before in the Harts-horn? And with the ſame Reaſon, when we are told, that torrify'd Sulphur makes bodies Blakc, I deſire to be told alſo, why Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction makes Sulphur it ſelf Black? nor will there be any Satisfactory Reaſon aſſign'd of theſe Quaeries, without taking in thoſe Fertile as well as Intelligible Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principles of the Poſition and Texture of the Minute parts of the body in reference to the Light and the Eye; and theſe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Principles may ſerve the turn in many caſes, where the Aduſtion of Sulphur can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pretended; as in the appearing Blackneſs of an Open window, lookt upon at a ſomewhat remote diſtance from the houſe, as alſo in the Blackneſs Men think they ſee in the Holes that happen to be in White linnen, or Paper of the like Colour; and in the Increaſing Blackneſs immediatly Produc'd barely by ſo rubbing Velvet,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56394:115"/>
whoſe Piles were Inclin'd before, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to a more Erected poſture, in which and in many other caſes formerly alleg'd, there appears nothing requiſite to the Production of <hi>the</hi> Blackneſs, but the hindering of the incident Beams of Light from rebounding plentifully enough to the Eye. To be ſhort, thoſe I reaſon with, do concerning Blackneſs, what the Chymiſts are wont alſo to do concerning other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, namely to content themſelves to tell us, in what Ingredient of a Mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Quality enquir'd after, does reſide, inſtead of explicating the Nature of it, which (to borrow a compariſon from their own Laboratories) is much as if in an enquiry after the cauſe of Salivation, they ſhould think it enough to tell us, that the ſeveral Kinds of Praecipitates of Gold and <hi>Mercury,</hi> as likewiſe of Quick-ſilver and Silver (for I know that make and uſe of ſuch Praecipitates alſo) do Salivate upon the account of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> which though Diſguis'd abounds in them, whereas the Difficulty is as much to know upon what account <hi>Mercury</hi> it ſelf, rather than other Bodies, has that power of working by Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Which I ſay not, as though it were not <hi>ſomething</hi> (and too often the moſt we can arrive at) to diſcover in which of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56394:116"/>
Ingredients of a Compounded Body, the Quality, whoſe Nature is fought, reſides, but becauſe, though this Diſcovery it ſelf may paſs for <hi>ſomething,</hi> and is oftentimes more than what is taught us about the ſame ſubjects in the Schools, yet we ought not to think it <hi>enough,</hi> when more Clear and Particular accounts are to be had.</p>

About ten in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Sun-ſhiny Weather, (but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fleeting Clouds) we took ſeveral ſorts of Paper Stain'd, ſome of one Colour, and ſome of another; and in a Darken'd Room whoſe Window look'd Southward, we caſt the Beams that came in at a hole about three Inches and a half in Diameter, upon a White wall that was plac'd on one ſide, about five foot diſtance from them.</p>
                        <p>The White gave much the Brighteſt Reflection.</p>
                        <p>The Green, Red, and Blew being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd together, the Red gave much the ſtrongeſt Reflection, and manifeſtly enough alſo threw its <hi>Colour</hi> upon the Wall; The Green and Blew were ſcarce Diſcernable
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56394:117"/>
by their Colours, and ſeem'd to reflect an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt EqualLight.</p>
                        <p>The Yellow Compar'd with the two laſt nam'd, Reflected ſomewhat more Light.</p>
                        <p>The Red and Purple being Compar'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the former manifeſtly Reflected a good deal more Light.</p>

                        <p>A Sheet of very well ſleek'd Marbl'd Paper being Apply'd as the others, did not caſt any of its Diſtinct Colours upon the Wall; nor throw its Light upon it with an Equal Diffuſion; but threw the Beams Unſtain'd and Bright to this and that part of the Wall, as if it's Poliſh had given it the Nature of a ſpecular Body.

                        <p>It may afford matter of Speculation to the Inquiſitive, ſuch as you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that as the Colours of outward Objects brought into a Darken'd Room, do ſo much depend for their Viſibility upon the Dimneſs of the Light they are there beheld by; that the ordinary Light of the day being freely let in upon them, they immediately diſappear: ſo our Tryals have inform'd us, that as to the Priſmatical Iris painted on the Floor by the Beams of the Sun Trajected through a Triangular-glaſs; though the Colours of it appear very Vivid ev'n at Noon-day, and in Sun ſhiny Weather, yet by a more Powerfull Light they may be made to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear. For having ſometimes, (in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of ſome Conjectures of mine not now to be Inſiſted on,) taken a large. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Concave <hi>Speculum,</hi> and with it caſt the converging Beams of the Sun upon a Priſmatical Iris which I had caus'd to be projected upon the Floor, I found that the over-powerfull Light made the Colours of the Iris diſappear. And if I ſo Reflected the Light as that it croſſ'd but the middle of the Iris, in that part only the Colours vaniſh'd or were made Inviſible; thoſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56394:121"/>
parts of the Iris that were on the right and left hand of the Reflected Light (which ſeem'd to divide them, and cut the Iris aſunder) continuing to exhibit the ſame Colours as before. But upon this we muſt not now ſtay to Speculate.</p>

                        <p>I have ſometimes thought it worth while to take notice, whether or no the Colours of Opacous Bodies might not appear to the Eye ſome what Diverſify'd, not only by the Diſpoſition of the Superficial parts of the Bodyes themſelves and by the Poſition of the Eye in Reference to the Object and the Light, (for theſe things are No orious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;) but according alſo to the Nature of the Lucid Body that ſhines upon them. And I remember that in Proſecution of this Curioſity, I obſerv'd a manifeſt Difference in ſome Kinds of Colour'd Bodyes look'd on by Day-light; and afterwards by the light of the Moon; either directly falling on them or Reflected upon them from a Concave Looking-glaſs. But not finding at preſent in my Collections about Colours any thing ſet down of this Kind, I ſhall, till I have opportunity to repeat them, content my ſelf to add what I find Regiſter'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

                        <p>Within a few dayes of the time above mention'd, divers Sheets of Colour'd Paper that had been look'd upon before in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine were look'd upon at night by the light of a pretty big Candle, (ſnuff'd) and the Changes that were obſerv'd were theſe.</p>
                        <p>The Yellow ſeem'd much fainter than in the Day, and inclinable to a pale Straw Colour.</p>

The Experiment as we made it is this. Take <hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> and with a Knife cut it into thin Slices, put about a handfull of theſe Slices into two three or four pound of the pureſt Spring-water, let them infuſe there a night, but if you be in haſt, a much ſhorter time may ſuffice; <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi> this Impregnated Water into a clear Glaſs Vial, and if you hold it directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Light and your Eye, you ſhall ſee it wholly Tincted (excepting the very top of the Liquor, wherein you will ſome times diſcern a Sky-colour'd Circle) with
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56394:124"/>
an almoſt Golden Colour, unleſs your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion have been made too Strong of the Wood, for in that caſe it will againſt the Light appear ſomewhat Dark and Reddiſh, and requires to be diluted by the addition of a convenient quantity of fair Water. But if you hold this Vial from the Light, ſo that your Eye be plac'd betwixt the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and the Vial, the Liquor will appear of a deep and lovely Coeruleous Colour, of which alſo the drops, if any be lying on the out-ſide of the Glaſs, will ſeem to be very perfectly; And thus far we have try'd the Experiment, and found it to ſucceed even by the Light of Candles of the larger ſize. If you ſo hold the Vial over againſt your Eyes, that it may have a Window on one ſide of it, and a Dark part of the Room both before it and on the other ſide, you ſhall ſee the Liquor partly of a Blewiſh and partly of a Golden Colour. If turning your back to the Window, you powr out ſome of the Liquor towards the Light and towards your Eyes, it will ſeem at the comming out of the Glaſs to be perfectly Coeruleous, but when it is ſallen down a little way, the drops may ſeem Partico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd, according as the Beams of Light do more or leſs fully Penetrate and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate them. If you take a Baſon about
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56394:125"/>
half full of Water, and having plac'd it ſo in the Sun-beams Shining into a Room, that one part of the Water may be freely Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the Beams of Light, and the other part of it Darkned by the ſhadow of the Brim of the Baſon, if then I ſay you drop of our Tincture, made ſomewhat ſtrong, both into the Shaded and Illuminated parts of the Water, you may by looking upon it from ſeveral places, and by a little Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the water, obſerve divers pleaſing Phoenomena which were tedious to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize. If you powr a little of this Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture upon a ſheet of White Paper, ſo as the Liquor may remain of ſome depth upon it, you may perceive the Neighbouring drops to be partly of one Colour, and partly of the other, according to the poſition of your Eye in reference to the Light when it looks upon them, but if you powr off all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, the Paper will ſeem Dy'd of an almoſt Yellow Colour. And if a ſheet of Paper with ſome of this Liquor in it be plac'd in a window where the Sunbeams may ſhine freely on it, then if you turn your back to the Sun and take a Pen or ſome ſuch ſlender Body, and hold it over-thwart betwixt the Sun and the Liquor, you may perceive that the Shadow projected by the Pen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Liquor, will not all of it be a vulgar
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56394:125"/>
and Dark, but in part a curiouſly Colour'd ſhadow, that edge of it, which is next the Body that makes it, being almoſt of a lively Golden Colour, and the remoter verge of a Coeruleous one.</p>
                        <p>Theſe and other Phoenomena, which I have obſerv'd in this delightfull Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, divers of my friends have look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not without ſome wonder, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member an excellent Oculiſt finding by accident in a friends Chamber a fine Vial full of this Liquor, which I had given that friend, and having never heard any thing of the Experiment, nor having any Body near him that could tell him what this ſtrange Liquor might be, was a great while apprehenſive, as he preſently after told me, that ſome ſtrange new diſtemper was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading his Eyes. And I confeſs that the unuſualneſs of the Phoenomena made me very ſollicitous to find out the Cauſe of this Experiment, and though I am far from pretending to have found it, yet my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries have, I ſuppoſe, enabled me to give ſuch hints, as may lead your greater ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity to the diſcovery of the Cauſe of this wonder. And firſt finding that this Tincture, if it were too copious in the water, Kept the Colours from being ſo lively, and their Change from being ſo diſcernable, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56394:126"/>
finding alſo that the Impregnating Virtue of this Wood did by its being frequently Infus'd in New Water by degrees Decay, I Conjectur'd that the Tincture afforded by the Wood muſt proceed from ſome Subtiler parts of it drawn forth by the Water, which ſwimming too and fro in it did ſo Modifie the Light, as to exhibit ſuch and ſuch Colours; and becauſe theſe Subtile parts were ſo eaſily Soluble even in Cold water, I concluded that they muſt abound with Salts, and perhaps contain much of the Eſſential Salt, as the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> call it, of the Wood. And to try whether theſe Subtile parts were Volatile enough to be Diſtill'd, without the Diſſolution of their Texture, I carefully Diſtill'd ſome of the Tincted Liquor in very low Veſſels, and the gentle heat of a Lamp Furnace; but found all that came over to be as Limpid and Colourleſs as Rock-water, and the Liquor remaining in the Veſſel to be ſo deeply Coeruleous, that it requir'd to be oppos'd to a very ſtrong Light to appear of any other Colour. I took likewiſe a Vial with Spirit of Wine, and a little Salt of Harts-horn, and found that there was a certain proportion to be met with betwixt the Liquor and the Salt, which made the Mixture fit to exhibit ſome little Variety
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56394:126"/>
of Colours not Obſervable in ordinary Liquors, as it was variouſly directed in reference to the Light and the Eye, but this Change of Colour was very far ſhort from that which we had admir'd in our Tincture. But however, I ſuſpected that the Tinging Particles did abound with ſuch Salts, whoſe Texture, and the Colour ſpringing from it, would probably be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by peircing Acid Salts, which would in likelihood either make ſome Diſſipation of their Parts, or Aſſociate themſelves to the like Bodies, and either way alter the Colour exhibited by them; whereupon Pouring into a ſmall Vial full of Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Water, a very little Spirit of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, I found that according to my Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, the Coeruleous Colour immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately vaniſh'd, but was deceiv'd in the Expectation I had, that the Golden Colour would do ſo too; for, which way ſoever I turned the Vial, either to or from the Light, I found the Liquor to appear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of a Yellowiſh Colour and no other: Upon this I imagin'd that the Acid Salts of the Vinegar having been able to deprive the Liquor of its Coeruleous Colour, a Sulphureous Salt being of a contrary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, would be able to Mortifie the Saline Particles of Vinegar, and Deſtroy their
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56394:127"/>
Effects; And accordingly having plac'd my Self betwixt the Window, and the Vial, and into the ſame Liquor dropt a few drops of Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> (as <hi>Chymists</hi> call it) I obſerv'd with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that immediately upon the Diffuſion of this Liquor, the Impregnated Water was reſtor'd to its former Coeruleous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; And this Liquor of <hi>Tartar</hi> being very Ponderous, and falling at firſt to the Bottom of the Vial, it was eaſie to obſerve that for a little while the Lower part of the Liquor appear'd deeply Coeruleous, whilſt all the Upper part retain'd its former Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs, which it immediately loſt as ſoon as either Agitation or Time had made a competent Diffuſion of the Liquor of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> through the Body of the former Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; and this reſtor'd Liquor did, as it was Look'd upon againſt or from the Light, exhibit the ſame <hi>Phaenomena</hi> as the Tincted Water did, before either of the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Liquors was pour'd into it.</p>
                        <p>Having made, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> divers Tryals upon this Nephritick Wood, we found mention made of it by the Induſtrious Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit <hi>Kircherus,</hi> who having received a Cup Turned of it from the <hi>Mexican</hi> Procurator of his Society, has probably receiv'd alſo from him the Information he gives us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

                        <p>In this paſſage we may take notice of the following Particulars. And firſt, he calls it a White <hi>Mexican</hi> Wood, whereas (not to mention that <hi>Mornardes</hi> informs us that it is brought out of <hi>Nova Hiſpania)</hi> the Wood that we have met with in ſeveral places, and employ'd as <hi>Lignum Nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum,</hi> was not White, but for the moſt part of a much Darker Colour, not unlike that of the Sadder Colour'd Wood of Juniper. 'Tis true, that <hi>Monardes</hi> himſelf alſo ſays, that the Wood is White; and it is affirm'd, that the Wood which is of a Sadder Colour is Adulterated by being Imbu'd with the Tincture of a Vegetable, in whoſe Decoction it is ſteep'd. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving purpoſely enquir'd of the Eminenteſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Druggiſts, he peremptorily deny'd it. And indeed, having conſider'd ſome of the faireſt Round pieces of this
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56394:128"/>
Wood that I could meet with in theſe Parts, I had Opportunity to take notice that in one or two of them it was the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of the Wood that was White, and the more Inward part that was of the other Colour, the contrary of which would probably have appear'd, if the Wood had been Adulterated after the afore-mention'd manner. And I have at preſent by me a piece of ſuch Wood, which for about an Inch next the Bark is White, and then as it were abruptly paſſes to the above-mention'd Colour, and yet this Wood by the Tincture, it afforded us in Water, appears to have its Colour'd part Genuine enough; for as for the White part, it appears upon tryal of both at once, much leſs enrich'd with the tingent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
                        <p>Next, whereas our Author tells us, that the Infuſion of this Wood expos'd in a Vial to the Light, looks like Spring-water, in which he afterwards adds, that there is no Tincture to be ſeen in it, our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and his agree not, for the Liquor, which oppoſed to the Darker part of a Room exhibits a Sky-colour, did conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when held againſt the Light, appear Yellowiſh or Reddiſh, according as its Tincture was more Dilute or Deep; and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56394:129"/>
then, whereas it has been already ſaid, that the Coeruleous Colour was by Acid Salts a boliſhed, this Yellowiſh one ſurviv'd without any conſiderable Alteration, ſo that unleſs our Author's Words be taken in a very Limited Senſe, we muſt conclude, that either his Memory miſ-inform'd him, or that his White <hi>Nephritick</hi> Wood, and the Sadder Colour'd one which we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, were not altogether of the ſame Nature: What he mentions of the Cup made of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> we have not had Opportunity to try, not having been able to procure pieces of that Wood great enough, and otherwiſe fit to be turned into Cups; but as for what he ſays in the Title of his Experiment, that this Wood tinges the Water with all ſorts of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that is much more than any of thoſe pieces of Nephritick Wood that we have hitherto employ'd, was able to make good; The change of Colours diſcernable in a Vial full of VVater, Impregnated by any of them, as it is directed towards a place more Lightſome or Obſcure, being far from affording a Variety anſwerable to ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing a Title. And as for what he tells us, that in the Dark the Infuſion of our VVood will reſume a Coeruleous Colour, I wiſh he had Inform'd us how he Try'd it.</p>
                        <p>

But this brings into my mind, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſometimes for Curioſity ſake, brought a round Vial with a long Neck fill'd with the Tincture of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> into the Darken'd Room already often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, and holding it ſometimes in, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times near the Sun-beams that enter'd at the hole, and ſometimes partly in them, and partly out of them, the Glaſs being held in ſeveral poſtures, and look'd upon from ſeveral Neighbouring parts of the Room, diſclos'd a much greater Variety of Colours than in ordinary inlightn'd Rooms it is wont to do; exhibiting, beſides the uſual Colours, a Red in ſome parts, and a Green in others, beſides Intermediate Colours produc'd by the differing Degrees, and odd mixtures of Light and Shade.</p>
                        <p>By all this You may ſee, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> the reaſonableneſs of what we elſewhere had occaſion to mention, when we have divers times told you, that it is uſefull to have New Experiments try'd over again, though they were, at firſt, made by Knowing and Candid Men, ſuch Reiterations of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments commonly exhibiting ſome New Phoenomena, detecting ſome Miſtake or hinting ſome Truth, in reference to them, that was not formerly taken notice of. And ſome of our friends have been pleaſ'd to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56394:130"/>
think, that we have made no unuſefull additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this Experiment, by ſhewing a way, how in a moment our Liquor may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of its Blewneſs, and reſtor'd to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the affuſion of a very few drops of Licuors, which have neither of them any Colour at all of their own. And that which deſerves ſome particular wonder, is, that the Coeruleous Tincture of our Wood is ſubject by the former Method to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd or Reſtor'd, the Yellowiſh or Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Tincture continuing what it was. And that you may ſee, that Salts are of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable uſe in the ſtriking of Colours, let me add to the many Experiments which may be afforded us to this purpoſe by the Dyers Trade, this Obſervation; That as far as we have hitherto try'd, thoſe Liquors in general that are ſtrong of Acid Salts have the Power of Deſtroying the Blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Infuſion of our Wood, and thoſe Liquors indiſcriminatly that abound with Sulphureous Salts, (under which I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Urinous and Volatile Salts of Animal Subſtances, and the Alcaliſate or fixed Salts that are made by Incineration) have the vertue of Reſtoring it.</p>

                           <p>That this Experiment, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> may be as well Uſefull as Delightfull to You, I muſt mind You, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that in the newly mention'd Obſervation, I have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to You a New and Eaſie way of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering in many Liquors (for I dare not ſay in all) whether it be an Acid or Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Salt, that is Predominant; and that ſuch a Diſcovery is oftentimes of great Difficulty, and may frequently be of great Uſe, he that is not a Stranger to the various Properties and Effects of Salts, and of how great moment it is to be able to diſtinguiſh their Tribes, may readily conceive. But to proceed to the way of trying other Liquors by an Infuſion of our Wood, take it briefly thus. Suppoſe I have a mind to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I conjecture aright, when I imagine that Allom, though it be plainly a Mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, does abound rather with Acid than Sulphureous Salt. To ſatisfie my ſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I turn my back to the Light, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſmall Vial full of the Tincture of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> which look'd upon in that Poſition, appears Coeruleous, I drop into it a little of a ſtrong Solution of Allom made in Fair Water, and finding upon the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56394:131"/>
Affuſion and ſhaking of this New liquor, that the Blewneſs formerly conſpicuous in our Tincture does preſently vaniſh, I am thereby incited to ſuppoſe, that the Salt Praedominant in Allom belongs to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Sour Salts; but if on the other ſide I have a mind to examine whether or no I rightly conceive that Salt of Urine, or of Harts-horn is rather of a Saline Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous (if I may ſo ſpeak) than of an Acid Nature, I drop a little of the Saline Spirit of either into the Nephritick Tincture, and finding that the Coeruleous Colour is rather thereby Deepned than Deſtroy'd, I collect that the Salts, which conſtitute theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, are rather Sulphureous than Acid. And to ſatisfie my ſelf yet farther in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I take a ſmall Vial of freſh Tincture, and placing both it and my ſelf in reference to the Light as formerly, I drop into the Infuſion juſt as much Diſtill'd Vinegar, or other Acid liquor as will ſerve to Deprive it of its Blewneſs (which a few drops, if the Sour Liquor be ſtrong, and the Vial ſmall will ſuffice to do) then without changing my Poſture, I drop and ſhake into the ſame Vial a ſmall proportion of Spirit of Harts-horn or Urine, and finding that upon this affuſion, the Tincture immediately recovers its Coeruleous Colour, I am thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56394:131"/>
in my former Opinion, of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Nature of theſe Salts. And ſo, whereas it is much doubted by ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Chymiſts to what ſort of Salt, that which is Praedominant in Quick-lime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, we have been perſwaded to referr it rather to Lixiviate than Acid Salts, by having obſerv'd, that though an Evaporated Infuſion of it will ſcarce yield ſuch a Salt, as Aſhes and other Alcalizate Bodyes are wont to do, yet if we deprive our Nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Tincture of its Blewneſs by juſt ſo much Diſtill'd Vinegar as is requiſite to make that Colour Vaniſh, the <hi>Lixivium</hi> of Quick-lime will immediately upon its Affuſion recall the Baniſhed Colour; but not ſo Powerfully as either of the Sulphureous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors formerly mention'd. And therefore I allow my ſelf to gueſs at the <hi>Strength</hi> of the Liquors examin'd by this Experiment, by the <hi>Quantity</hi> of them which is ſufficient to Deſtroy or Reſtore the Coeruleous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of our Tincture. But whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Liquors, wherein neither Acid nor Alcaliſate Salts are Eminently Praedomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, our Tincture will enable us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture any thing more than that ſuch Salts are not Praedominant in them, I take not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to determine here, but leave to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tryal; For I find not that Spirit of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56394:132"/>
Wine, Spirit of Tartar freed from Acidity, or Chymical Oyl of Turpentine, (although Liquors which muſt be conceiv'd very Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, if Chymiſts have, which is here no place to Diſpute, rightly aſcrib'd taſts to the Saline Principle of Bodyes,) have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Power either to deprive our Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of its Coeruleous Colour, or reſtore it, when upon the Affuſion of Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar it has diſappear'd.</p>

                        <p>And here I muſt not omit, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to inform You, that we can ſhew You even in a Mineral Body ſomething that may ſeem very near of Kin to the Changeable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Tincture of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> for we have ſeveral flat pieces of Glaſs, of the thickneſs of ordinary Panes for Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, one of which being interpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Eye and a cleer Light, appears of a Golden Colour, not much unlike that of the moderate Tincture of our Wood, but being ſo look'd upon as that the Beams of light are not ſo much Trajected thorough it as Reflected from it to the Eye, that Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſeems to degenerate into a pale Blew, ſomewhat like that of a Turquoiſe. And that which may alſo appear ſtrange, is this,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56394:132"/>
that if in a certain poſture you hold one of theſe Plates Perpendicular to the Horizon, ſo that the Sun-beams ſhine upon half of it, the other half being Shaded, You may ſee that the part Shin'd upon will be of a much Diluter Yellow than the Shaded part which will appear much more Richly Colour'd; and if You alter the Poſture of the Glaſs, ſo that it be not held Perpendicular, but Parallel in reference to the Horizon, You may ſee, (which perhaps you will admire) the Shaded part look of a Golden Colour, but the other that the Sun ſhines freely on, will appear conſiderably Blew, and as you remove any part of the Glaſs thus held Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontally into the Sun-beams or Shade, it will in the twinkling of an Eye ſeem to paſs from one of the above mention'd Colours to the other, the Sun-beams Trajected through it upon a ſheet of White Paper held near it, do colour it with a Yellow, ſomewhat bordering upon a Red, but yet the Glaſs may be ſo oppos'd to the Sun, that it may upon Paper project a mix'd Colour here and there more inclin'd to Yellow, and here and there more to Blew. The other Phoenomena of this odd Glaſs, I fear it would be ſcarce worth while to Record, and therefore I ſhall rather advertiſe You, <hi>First,</hi> that in the trying of theſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56394:133"/>
with it, you muſt take notice that one of the ſides has either alone, or at leaſt principally its Superficial parts diſpos'd to the Reflection of the Blew Colour above nam'd, and that therefore you muſt have a care to keep that ſide neareſt to the Eye. And next, that we have our ſelves made Glaſſes not unfit to exhibit an Experiment not unlike that I have been ſpeaking of, by laying upon pieces of Glaſs ſome very fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foliated Silver, and giving it by degrees a much ſtronger Fire than is requiſite or uſual for the Tinging of Glaſſes of other Colours. And this Experiment, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it was made without a Furnace in which Artificers that Paint Glaſs are wont to be very Curious, is the more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe, that though a Skilfull Painter could not deny to me that 'twas with Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he Colour'd his Glaſſes Yellow; yet he told me, that when to Burn them (as they ſpeak) he layes on the plates of Glaſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>Calx</hi> of Silver Calcin'd without Corroſive Liquors, and Temper'd with Fair Water, the Plates are Ting'd of a fine Yellow that looks of a Golden Colour, which part ſoever of it you turn to or from the Light; whereas (whether it be what an Artificer would call Over-doing, or Burning, or elſe the imploying the Silver
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56394:133"/>
Crude that makes the Difference,) we have found more than once, that ſome Pieces of Glaſs prepar'd as we have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though held againſt the Light they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd of a Tranſparent Yellow, yet look'd on with ones back turn'd to the Light they exhibited an Untranſparent Blew.</p>

                        <p>If you will allow me, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> for the avoiding of Ambignity, to imploy the Word Pigments, to ſignifie ſuch prepared materials (as Cochinele, Vermilion, Orpiment,) as Painters, Dyers and other Artificers make uſe of to impart or imitate particular Colours, I ſhall be the better underſtood in divers paſſages of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing papers, and particularly when I tell you, That the mixing of Pigments being no inconſiderable part of the Painters Art, it may ſeem an Incroachment in me to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it. But I think I may eaſily be excus'd (though I do not altogether paſs it by) if I reſtrain my ſelf to the making of a Tranſient mention of ſome few of their Practices about this matter; and that only ſo far forth, as may warrant me to obſerve to you, that there are but few Simple and Primary Colours (if I may ſo call them)
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56394:134"/>
from whoſe Various Compoſitions all the reſt do as it were Reſult. For though Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can imitate the Hues (though not always the Splendor) of thoſe almoſt Numberleſs differing Colours that are to be met with in the Works of Nature, and of Art, I have not yet found, that to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit this ſtrange Variety they need imploy any more than <hi>White,</hi> and <hi>Black,</hi> and <hi>Red,</hi> and <hi>Blew,</hi> and <hi>Yellow;</hi> theſe <hi>five,</hi> Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly <hi>Compounded,</hi> and (if I may ſo ſpeak) <hi>Decompounded,</hi> being ſufficient to exhibit a Variety and Number of Colours, ſuch, as thoſe that are altogether Strangers to the Painters Pallets, can hardly imagine.</p>
                        <p>Thus (for Inſtance) Black and White differingly mix'd, make a Vaſt company of Lighter and Darker Grays.</p>

                        <p>Red with an Eye of Blew, makes a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and by theſe ſimple Compoſitions again Compounded among themſelves, the Skilfull Painter can produce what kind of Colour he pleaſes, and a great many more than we have yet Names for. But, as I intimated above, 'tis not my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56394:134"/>
to proſecute this Subject, though I thought it not unfit to take ſome Notice of it, becauſe we may hereafter have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make uſe of what has been now deliver'd, to illuſtrate the Generation of Intermediate Colours; concerning which we muſt yet ſubjoyn this Caution, that to make the Rules about the Emergency of Colours, fit to be Relied upon, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles whereof the Pigments conſiſt muſt be ſuch as do not Deſtroy one anothers Texture, for in caſe they do, the produced Colour may be very Different from that which would Reſult from the Mixture of other harmleſs Pigments of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as I ſhall have Occaſion to ſhew ere long.</p>

                        <p>It may alſo give much light to an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer into the Nature of Colours, to know that not only in Green, but in many (if not all) other Colours, the Light of the Sun paſſing through Diaphanous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of differing Hues may be tinged of the ſame Compound Colour, as if it came from ſome Painters Colours of the ſame Denomination, though this later be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by Reflection, and be (as the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56394:135"/>
former Experiment declares) manifeſtly Compounded of material Pigments. Wherefore to try the Compoſition of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours by Trajection, we provided ſeveral Plates of Tinged Glaſs, which being laid two at a time one on the top of another, the Object look'd upon through them both, appear'd of a Compounded Colour, which agrees well with what we have obſerv'd in the ſecond Experiment, of Looking againſt the Light through differingly Colour'd Papers. But we thought the Experiment would be more Satisfactory, if we procur'd the Sun-beams to be ſo Ting'd in their paſſage through Plates of Glaſs, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the Compounded Colour upon a Sheet of White Paper. And though by reaſon of the Thickneſs of the Glaſſes, the Effect was but Faint, even when the Sun was High and Shin'd forth clear, yet, we eaſily remedied that by Contracting the Beams we caſt on them by means of a Convex Burning-glaſs, which where it made the Beams much converge Increas'd the Light enough to make the Compounded Colour very manifeſt upon the Paper. By this means we obſerv'd, that the Beams trajected through Blew and Yellow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd a Green, that an intenſe and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Red did with Yellow make differing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56394:135"/>
degrees of Saffron, and Orange Tawny Colours, that Green and Blew made a Colour partaking of both, ſuch as that which ſome Latin Writers call <hi>Pavona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus,</hi> that Red and Blew made a Purple, to which we might add other Colours, that we produc'd by the Combinations of Glaſſes differingly Ting'd, but that I want proper Words to expreſs them in our Language, and had not when we made the Tryals, the Opportunity of conſulting with a Painter, who perchance might have Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd me with ſome of the terms I wanted.</p>
                        <p>I know not whether it will be requiſite to ſubjoyn on this Occaſion, what I tried concerning Reflections from Colour'd Glaſſes, and other Tranſparent Bodies, namely, that having expos'd four or five ſorts of them to the Sun, and caſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected Beams upon White Paper held near at hand, the Light appear'd not manifeſtly Ting'd, but as if it had been Reflected from the Impervious parts of a Colourleſs Glaſs, only that Reflected from the Yellow was here and there ſtain'd with the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, as if thoſe Beams were not all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected from the Superficial, but ſome from the Internal parts of the Glaſs; upon which Occaſion you may take notice, that a Skilfull Tradeſman, who makes ſuch Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56394:136"/>
Glaſs told me, that where as the Red Pigment was but Superficial, the Yellow penetrated to the very midſt of the Plate. But for further Satisfaction, not having the Opportunity to Foliate thoſe Plates, and ſo turn them into Looking-glaſſes, we Foliated a Plate of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Glaſs, and then laying on it a little Tranſparent Varniſh of a Gold Colour, we expos'd it to the Sun-beams, ſo as to caſt them upon a Body fit to receive them, on which the Reflected Light, appearing, as we expected, Yellow, manifeſted that Rebounding from the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular part of the <hi>Selenitis,</hi> it was Ting'd in its return with the Colour of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Varniſh through which it paſs'd.</p>

                        <p>After what we have ſaid of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Colours, it will now be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to annex ſome Experiments that we made in favour of thoſe Colours, that are taught in the Schools not to be Real, but only Apparent and Phantaſtical; For we found by Tryals, that theſe Colours might be Compounded, both with True and Stable Colours, and with one another, as well as unqueſtionably Genuine and Laſting Colours, and that the Colours
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56394:136"/>
reſulting from ſuch Compoſitions, would reſpectively deſerve the ſame Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
                        <p>For firſt, having by the Trajection of the Sun-beams through a Glaſs-priſm thrown an Iris on the Floor, I found that by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Blew Glaſs at a convenient diſtance betwixt the Priſm and the Iris, that part of the Iris that was before Yellow, might be made to appear Green, though not of a Graſs Green, but of one more Dilute and Yellowiſh. And it ſeems not improbable, that the narrow Greeniſh Liſt (if I may ſo call it) that is wont to be ſeen between the Yellow and Blew parts of the Iris, is made by the Confuſion of thoſe two Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Colours.</p>
                        <p>Next, I found, that though the want of a ſufficient Livelineſs in either of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Colours, or a light Error in the manner of making the following Tryals, was enough to render ſome of them Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfull, yet when all neceſſary Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances were duely obſerv'd, the Event was anſwerable to our Expectation and Deſire.</p>
                        <p>And (as I formerly Noted) that Red and Blew compound a Purple, ſo I could produce this laſt nam'd Colour, by caſting at ſome Diſtance from the Glaſs the Blew
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56394:137"/>
part of the Priſmatical Iris (as I think it may be call'd for Diſtinction ſake) upon a Lively Red, (for elſe the Experiment ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not ſo well.) And I remember, that ſometimes when I try'd this upon a piece of Red Cloath, <hi>that</hi> part of the Iris which would have been Blew, (as I try'd by covering that part of the Cloath with a piece of White Paper) and Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Red, wherewith the Cloath was Imbued before, appear'd of a fair Purple, did, when I came to View it near at hand, look very Odly, as if there were ſome ſtrange Reflection or Refraction or both made in the Hairs of which that Cloath was compoſed.</p>
                        <p>Caſting likewiſe the Priſmatical Iris upon a very Vivid Blew, I found that part of it, which would elſe have been the Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, appear Green. (Another ſomewhat differing Tryal, and yet fit to confirm this, you will find in the fifteenth Experiment.)</p>
                        <p>But it may ſeem ſomewhat more ſtrange, that though the Priſmatical Iris being made by the Refraction of Light through a Body that has no Colour at all, muſt according to the Doctrine of the Schools conſiſt of as purely Emphatical Colours, as may be, yet even theſe may be Compounded with one another, as well as Real Colours in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56394:137"/>
the Groſſeſt Pigments. For I took at once two Triangular Glaſſes, and one of them being kept fixt in the ſame Poſture, that the Iris it projected on the Floor might not Waver, I caſt on the ſame Floor another Iris with the other Priſm, and Moving it too and fro to bring what part of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Iris I pleas'd, to fall upon what part of the firſt I thought fit, we did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (for a ſmall Errour ſuffices to hinder the Succeſs) obtain by this means a Green Colour in that part of the more Stable Iris, that before was Yellow, or Blew, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by caſting thoſe Beams, that in one of the Iris's made the Blew upon the Red parts of the other Iris, we were able to produce a lovely Purple, which we can Deſtroy or Recompoſe at pleaſure, by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and Reapproaching the Edges of the two Iris's.</p>

                        <p>On this occaſion, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I ſhall add, that finding the Glaſs-priſm to be the uſefulleſt Inſtrument Men have yet imploy'd about the Contemplation of Colours, and conſidering that Priſms hitherto in uſe are made of Glaſs Tranſparent and Colourleſs, I thought it would not be amiſs to try,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56394:138"/>
what change the Superinduction of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, without the Deſtruction of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneity, would produce in the Colours exhibited by the Priſm. But being unable to procure one to be made of Colour'd Glaſs, and fearing alſo that if it were not carefully made, the Thickneſs of it would render it too Opacous, I endeavoured to ſubſtitute one made of Clarify'd Roſin, or of Turpentine brought (as I elſewhere teach) to the conſiſtence of a Tranſparent Gum. But though theſe Endeavours were not wholly loſt, yet we found it ſo difficult to give theſe Materials their true Shape, that we choſe rather to Varniſh over an ordinary Priſm with ſome of thoſe few Pigments that are to be had Tranſparent; as accordingly we did firſt with Yellow, and then with Red, or rather Crimſon, made with Lake temper'd with a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Oyl, and the Event was, That for want of good Tranſparent Colours, (of which you know there are but very few) both the Yellow and the Red made the Glaſs ſo Opacous, (though the Pigment were laid on but upon two Sides of the Glaſs, no more being abſolutely neceſſary) that unleſs I look'd upon an Inlightned Window, or the Flame of a Candle, or ſome other Luminous or very Vivid object,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56394:138"/>
I could ſcarce diſcern any Colours at all, eſpecially when the Glaſs was cover'd with Red. But when I did look on ſuch Objects, it appear'd (as I expected) that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Pigment had Vitiated or Drown'd ſome of thoſe which the Priſm would according to its wont have exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and mingling with others, Alter'd them: as I remember, that both to my Eyes, and others to whom I ſhow'd it, when the Priſm was cover'd with Yellow, it made thoſe Parts of bright Objects, where the Blew would elſe have been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, appear of a light Green. But, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> both the Nature of the Colours, and the Degree of Tranſparency, or of Darkneſs in the Pigment, beſides divers other Circumſtances, did ſo vary the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of theſe Tryals, that till I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſmall Colour'd Priſms, or Hollow ones that may be filled with Tincted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, or obtain ſome better Pigments than thoſe I was reduc'd to imploy, I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to Build any thing upon what has been deliver'd, and ſhall make no other uſe of it, than to invite you to proſecute the Inquiry further.</p>

                        <p>And here, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> ſince we are treating of Emphatical Colours, we ſhall add what we think not unworthy your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and not unfit to afford ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to the Speculative. For there are ſome Liquors, which though Colourleſs themſelves, when they come to be Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and Diſpers'd into Exhalations, exhibit a conſpicuous Colour, which they loſe again, when they come to be Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd into a Liquor, as good Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> or upon its account ſtrong <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> though devoid of all appearance of Redneſs whilſt they continue in the form of a Liquor, if a little Heat chance to turn the Minute parts of them into Vapours, the Steam will appear of a Reddiſh or deep Yellow Colour, which will Vaniſh when thoſe Exhalations come to reſume the form of a Liquor.</p>
                        <p>And not only if you look upon a Glaſs half full of <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> or Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and half full of <hi>Nitrous</hi> ſteams proceeding from it, you will ſee the Upper part of the Glaſs of the Colour freſhly mention'd, if through it you look upon the Light. But which is much more conſiderable, I
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56394:139"/>
have tried, that putting <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> in a long clear Glaſs, and adding a little Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or ſome ſuch open Metall to it, to excite Heat and Fumes, the Light tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected through thoſe Fumes, and caſt upon a ſheet of White Paper, did upon that appear of the Colour that the Fumes did, when directly Look'd upon, as if the Light were as well Ting'd in its paſſage through theſe Fumes, as it would have been by paſſing through ſome Glaſs or Liquor in which the ſame Colour was Inherent.</p>
                        <p>To which I ſhall further add, that having ſometimes had the Curioſity to obſerve whether the Beams of the Sun near the Horizon trajected through a very Red Sky, would not (though ſuch Redneſſes are taken to be but Emphatical Colours) exhibit the like Colour, I found that the Beams falling within a Room upon a very White Object, plac'd directly oppoſite to the Sun, diſclos'd a manifeſt Redneſs, as if they had paſs'd through a Colour'd <hi>Medium.</hi>

                        <p>The emergency, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> of Colours upon the Coalition of the Particles of ſuch Bodies as were neither of them of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of that Mixture whereof they are the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56394:140"/>
Ingredients, is very well worth our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Obſervation, as being of good uſe both Speculative and Practical; For much of the Mechanical uſe of Colours among Painters and Dyers, doth depend upon the Knowledge of what Colours may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the Mixtures of Pigments ſo and ſo Colour'd. And (as we lately inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) 'tis of advantage to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative Naturaliſt, to know how many and which Colours are Primitive (if I may ſo call them) and Simple, becauſe it both eaſes his Labour by confining his moſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitious Enquiry to a ſmall Number of Colours upon which the reſt depend, and aſſiſts him to judge of the nature of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular compounded Colours, by ſhewing him from the Mixture of what more Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ones, and of what Proportions of them to one another, the particular Colour to be conſider'd does reſult. But becauſe to inſiſt on the Proportions, the Manner and the Effects of ſuch Mixtures would oblige me to conſider a greater part of the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Art and Dyers Trade, than I am well acquainted with, I confin'd my ſelf to make Trial of <hi>ſeveral ways to produce Green,</hi> by the compoſition of Blew and Yellow. And ſhall in this place both Recapitulate moſt of the things I have Diſperſedly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56394:140"/>
already concerning that Subject, and Recruit them.</p>
                        <p>And firſt, whereas Painters (as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above) are wont to make Green by tempering Blew and Yellow, both of them made into a ſoft Conſiſtence, with either Water or Oyl, or ſome Liquor of Kin to one of thoſe two, according as the Picture is to be Drawn with thoſe they call <hi>Water Colours,</hi> or thoſe they term <hi>Oyl Colours,</hi> I found that by chooſing fit Ingredients, and mixing them in the form of Dry Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I could do, what I could not if the Ingredients were temper'd up with a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; But the Blew and Yellow Powders muſt not only be finely Ground, but ſuch as that the Corpuſcles of the one may not be too unequal to thoſe of the other, leſt by their Diſproportionate Minuteneſs the Smaller cover and hide the Greater. We us'd with good ſucceſs a ſlight Mixture of the fine Powder of Biſe, with that of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piment, or that of good Yellow Oker, I ſay a <hi>ſlight</hi> Mixture, becauſe we found that an <hi>exquiſite</hi> Mixture did not do ſo well, but by lightly mingling the two Pigments in ſeveral little Parcels, thoſe of them in which the Proportion and Manner of Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was more Lucky, afforded us a good Green.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="234" facs="tcp:56394:141"/>
2. We alſo learn'd in the Dye-houſes, that Cloth being Dy'd Blew with Woad, is afterwards by the Yellow Decoction of <hi>Luteola</hi> or Wood-wax Dy'd into a Green Colour.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. You may alſo remember what we above Related, where we intimated, that having in a Darkn'd Room taken two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, a Blew and a Yellow, and caſt the Light Reflected from the one upon the other, we likewiſe obtain'd a Green.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And you may remember, that we obſerv'd a Green to be produc'd, when in the ſame Darkn'd Room we look'd at the Hole at which alone the Light enter'd, through the Green and Yellow parts of a ſheet of Marbl'd Paper laid over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. We found too, that the Beams of the Sun being trajected through two pieces of Glaſs, the one Blew and the other Yellow, laid over one another, did upon a ſheet of White paper on which they were made to fall, exhibit a lovely Green.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. I hope alſo, that you have not already forgot, what was ſo lately deliver'd, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the compoſition of a Green, with a Blew and Yellow; of which moſt Authors would call the one a <hi>Real,</hi> and the other an <hi>Emphatical.</hi>

7. And I preſume, you may have yet freſh in your memory, what the fourteenth Experiment informs you, concerning the exhibiting of a Green, by the help of a Blew and Yellow, that were both of them Emphatical.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Wherefore we will proceed to take notice, that we alſo deviſ'd a way of trying whether or no Metalline Solutions though one of them at leaſt had its Colour Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious, by the mixture of the <hi>Menstruum</hi> employ'd to diſſolve it, might not be made to compound a Green after the manner of other Bodies. And though this ſeem'd not eaſie to be perform'd by reaſon of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of finding Metalline Solutions of the Colour requiſite, that would mix without Praecipitating each other; yet after a while having conſider'd the matter, the firſt Tryal afforded me the following Experiment. I took a High Yellow Solution of good Gold in <hi>Aqua-Regis,</hi> (made of <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and as I remember half its weight of Spirit of Salt) To this I put a due Proportion of a deep and lovely Blew Solution of Crude Copper, (which I have elſewhere taught to be readily Diſſoluble in ſtrong Spirit of Urine) and theſe two Liquors though at firſt they ſeem'd a little to Curdle one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet being throughly mingl'd by Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56394:142"/>
they preſently, as had been Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctur'd, united into a Tranſparent Green Liquor, which continu'd ſo for divers days that I kept it in a ſmall Glaſs wherein 'twas made, only letting fall a little Blackiſh Powder to the Bottom. The other <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of this Experiment belong not to this place, where it may ſuffice to take notice of the Production of a Green, and that the Experiment was more than once repeated with Succeſs.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. And laſtly, to try whether this way of compounding Colours would hold ev'n in Ingredients actually melted by the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Fire, provided their Texture were capable of ſafely induring Fuſion, we caus'd ſome Blew and Yellow Ammel to be long and well wrought together in the Flame of a Lamp, which being Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Inceſſantly blown on them kept them in ſome degree of Fuſion, and at length (for the Experiment requires ſome Patience as well as Skil) we obtain'd the expected Ammel of a Green Colour.</p>
                        <p>I know not, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> whether it be worth while to acquaint you with the ways that came into my Thoughts, whereby in ſome meaſure to explicate the firſt of the ment on'd ways of making a Green; for I have ſometimes Conjectur'd, that the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56394:142"/>
of the Biſe and the Orpiment produc'd a Green by ſo altering the Superficial Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, which each of thoſe Ingredients had apart, that the Light Incident on the mixture was Reflected with differing Shades, as to Quantity, or Order, or both, from thoſe of either of the Ingredients, and ſuch as the Light is wont to be Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with, when it Reflects from Graſs, or Leaves, or ſome of thoſe other Bodies that we are wont to call Green. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too I have doubted, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Green might not be partly at leaſt deriv'd from this, That the Beams that Rebound from the Corpuſcles of the Orpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, giving one kind of ſtroak upon the <hi>Retina,</hi> whoſe Perception we call Yellow, and the Beams Reflected from the Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Biſe, giving another ſtroak upon the ſame <hi>Retina,</hi> like to Objects that are Blew, the Contiguity and Minuteneſs of theſe Corpuſcles may make the Appulſe of the Reflected Light fall upon the <hi>Retina</hi> within ſo narrow a Compaſs, that the part they Beat upon being but as it were a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical point, they may give a Compounded ſtroak, which may conſequently exhibit a Compounded and new Kind of Senſation, as we ſee that two Strings of a Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument being ſtruck together, making two
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56394:143"/>
Noiſes that arrive at the Ear at the ſame time as to Senſe, yield a Sound differing from either of them, and as it were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of both; Inſomuch that if they be Diſcordantly tun'd, though each of them ſtruck apart would yield a Pleaſing Sound, yet being ſtruck together they make but a Harſh and troubleſome Noiſe. But this not being ſo fit a place to proſecute Speculations, I ſhall not inſiſt, neither upon theſe Conjectures nor any others, which the Experiment we have been mentioning may have ſuggeſted to me. And I ſhall leave it to you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to derive what Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction you can from comparing together the Various ways whereby a Yellow and a Blew can be made to Compound a Green. That which I now pretend to, being only to ſhew that the firſt of thoſe mention'd ways, (not to take at preſent notice of the reſt) does far better agree with out Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures about Colours, than either with the Doctrine of the Schools, or with that of the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> both which ſeem to be very much Disfavour'd by it.</p>
                        <p>For firſt, ſince in the Mixture of the two mention'd Powders I could by the help of a very excellent <hi>Microſcope</hi> (for ordinary ones will ſcarce ſerve the turn) diſcover that which ſeem'd to the naked Eye a Green
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56394:143"/>
Body, to be but a heap of Diſtinct, though very ſmall Grains of Yellow Orpiment and Blew Biſe confuſedly enough Blended together, it appears that the Colour'd Corpuſcles of either kind did each retain its own Nature and Colour; By which it may be gueſs'd, what meer Tranſpoſition and Juxtapoſition of Minute and Singly unchang'd Particles of Matter can do to produce a new Colour; For that this Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Motion and new Diſpoſition of the ſmall parts of the Orpiment did Intervene is much more manifeſt than it is eaſie to Explicate how they ſhould produce this new Green otherwiſe than by the new Manner of their being put together, and conſequently by their new Diſpoſition to Modifie the Incident Light by Reflecting it otherwiſe than they did before they were Mingl'd together.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Green thus made being (if I may ſo ſpeak) Mechanically produc'd, there is no pretence to derive it from I know not what incomprehenſible Subſtantial Form, from which yet many would have us believe that Colours muſt flow; Nor does this Green, though a Real and Perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, not a Phantaſtical and Vanid Colour, ſeem to be ſuch an Inherent Quality as they would have it, ſince not only each part of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56394:144"/>
the Mixture remains unalter'd in Colour, and conſequently of a differing Colour from the Heap they Compoſe, but if the Eye be aſſiſted by a <hi>Microſcope</hi> to diſcern things better and more diſtinctly than before it could, it ſees not a Green Body, but a Heap of Blew and Yellow Corpuſcles.</p>
                        <p>And in the third place, I demand what either Sulphur, or Salt, or Mercury has to do in the Production of this Green; For neither the Biſe nor the Orpiment were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd with that Colour before, and the bare Juxtapoſition of the Corpuſcles of the two Powders that work not upon each other, but might if we had convenient Inſtruments be ſeparated, unalter'd, cannot with any probability be imagin'd either to Increaſe or Diminiſh any of the three Hypoſtatical Principles, (to which of them ſoever the <hi>Chymists</hi> are pleas'd to aſcribe Colours) nor does there here Intervene ſo much as Heat to afford them any colour to pretend, that at leaſt there is made an Extraverſion (as the <hi>Helmontians</hi> ſpeak) of the Sulphur or of any of the two other ſuppoſed Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; But upon this Experiment we have already Reflected enough, if not more than enough for once.</p>

                        <p>But here, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I muſt advertiſe you, that 'tis not every Yellow and every Blew that being mingl'd will afford a Green; For in caſe one of the Ingredients do not Act only as endow'd with ſuch a Colour, but as having a power to alter the Texture of the Corpuſcles of the other, ſo as to Indiſpoſe them to Reflect the Light, as Corpuſcles that exhibit a Blew or a Yellow are wont to Reflect it, the emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Colour may be not Green, but ſuch as the change of Texture in the Corpuſcles of one or both of the Ingredients qualifies them to ſhew forth; as for inſtance, if you let fall a few Drops of Syrrup of Violets upon a piece of White Paper, though the Syrrup being ſpread will appear Blew, yet mingling with it two or three Drops of the lately mention'd Solution of Gold, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd not a Green but a Reddiſh mixture, which I expected from the remaining Power of the Acid Salts abounding in the Solution, ſuch Salts or Saline Spirits being wont, as we ſhall ſee anon, though weakn'd, ſo to work upon that Syrrup as to change it into a Red or Reddiſh Colour. And to confirm that for which I allege the former
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56394:145"/>
Experiment, I ſhall add this other, that having made a very ſtrong and high-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd Solution of Filings of Copper with Spirit of Urine, though the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> ſeem'd Glutted with the Metall, becauſe I put in ſo much Filings that many of them remain'd for divers days Undiſſolv'd at the Bottom, yet having put three or four Drops of Syrrup of Violets upon White Paper, I found that the deep Blew Solution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably mingl'd with this other Blew Liquor did not make a Blew mixture, but, as I expected, a fair Green, upon the account of the Urinous Salt that was in the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum.</hi>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56394:145"/>
own Laboratories, namely, that divers, if not all, Chymical Eſſential Oyls, as alſo good Spirit of Wine, being ſhaken till they have good ſtore of Bubbles, thoſe Bubbles will (if attentively conſider'd) appear adorn'd with various and lovely Colours, which all immediately Vaniſh, upon the relapſing of the Liquor that affords thoſe Bubbles their Skins, into the reſt of the Oyl, or Spirit of Wine, ſo that a Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Liquor may be made in a trice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit variety of Colours, and may loſe them in a moment without the Acceſſion or Diminution of any of its Hypoſtatical Principles. And, by the way, 'tis not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy our notice, that ſome Bodies, as well Colourleſs, as Colour'd, by being brought to a great Thinneſs of parts, acquire Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours though they had none before, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours differing from them they were before endued with: For, not to inſiſt on the Variety of Colours, that Water, made ſomewhat Glutinous by Sope, acquires, when 'tis blown into ſuch Sphaerical Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles as Boys are wont to make and play with; Turpentine (though it have a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour deep enough of its own) may (by being blown into after a certain manner) be brought to afford Bubbles adorn'd with variety of Orient Colours, which though
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56394:146"/>
they Vaniſh after ſome while upon the breaking of the Bubbles, yet they would in likelihood always exhibit Colours upon their <hi>Superfices,</hi> (though not always the ſame in the ſame Parts of them, but Vary'd according to the Incidence of the Sight, and the Poſition of the Eye) if their Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were durable enough: For I have ſeen one that was Skill'd at faſhioning Glaſſes by the help of a Lamp, blowing ſome of them ſo ſtrongly as to burſt them, whereupon it was found, that the Tenacity of the Metall was ſuch, that before it broke it ſuffer'd it ſelf to be reduc'd into Films ſo extremely thin, that being kept clean they conſtantly ſhew'd on their Surfaces (but after the manner newly mention'd) the varying Colours of the Rain-bow, which were exceedingly Vivid, as I had often opportunity to obſerve in ſome, that I caus'd purpoſely to be made, to keep by me.</p>

For, as I find that either Spirit of Salt, or Oyl of Vitriol, or <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> or Spirit of Vinegar, or Juice of Lemmons, or any of the Acid Liquors I have yet had occaſion to try, will turn Syrrup of Violets, of a <hi>Red,</hi> (or at leaſt) of a <hi>Reddiſh</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſo I have found, that not only the Volatile Salts of all Animal Subſtances I have us'd, as Spirit of Harts-horn, of Urine, of Sal-Armoniack, of Blood, &amp;c. but alſo all the Alcalizate Salts I have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, as the Solution of Salt of Tartar, of Pot-aſhes, of common Wood-aſhes, Lime-water, &amp;c. will immediately change the Blew Syrrup, into a perfect Green. And by the ſame way (to hint that upon
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56394:148"/>
the by) I elſewhere ſhow you, both the changes that Nature and Time produce, in the more Saline parts of ſome Bodies, may be diſcover'd, and alſo how ev'n ſuch Chymically prepar'd Bodies, as belong not either to the Animal Kingdome, or to the Tribe of <hi>Alcali's,</hi> may have their new and ſuperinduc'd Nature ſucceſsfully Examin'd. In this place I ſhall only add, that not alone the Changing the Colour of the Syrrup, requires, that the Changing Body be more ſtrong, of the Acid, or other ſort of Salt that is Predominant in it, than is requiſite for the working upon the Tincture of <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Nephriticum;</hi> but that in this alſo, the Operation of the formerly mention'd Salts upon our Syrrup, differs from their Operation upon our Tinctures, that in this Liquor, if the Caeruleous Colour be <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd</hi> by an Acid Salt, it may be <hi>Restor'd</hi> by one that is either Volatile, or Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate; whereas in Syrrup of Violets, though one of theſe contrary Salts will <hi>destroy</hi> the Action of the other, yet neither of them will <hi>reſtore</hi> the Syrrup to its native Blew; but each of them will Change it into the Colour which it ſelf doth (if I may ſo ſpeak) affect, as we ſhall have Occaſion to ſhow in the Notes on the twenty fifth Experiment.</p>

But I have try'd, that when they are freſhly gather'd, they will afford a Juice, which when newly expreſs'd, (for in ſome caſes 'twill ſoon enough degenerate) affords a very deep and pleaſant Blew. Now, (to draw this to our preſent Scope) by dropping on this freſh Juice, a little Spirit of Salt, (that being the Acid Spirit I had then at hand) it immediately turn'd (as I predicted) into a Red. And if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Sowr Spirit I mingled with it a little ſtrong Solution of an Alcalizate Salt, it did preſently diſcloſe a lovely Green; the ſame Changes being by thoſe differing ſorts of Saline Liquors, producible in this <hi>Natural juice,</hi> that we lately mention'd to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56394:149"/>
have happen'd to that <hi>factitious Mixture,</hi> the Syrrup of Violets.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56394:150"/>
to the two former, made upon Syrrup of Violets, and Juice of Blew-bottles. For as in them by the Affuſion of Oyl of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, a Blewiſh Liquor is made Green, ſo in this, by the ſole Mixture of the ſame Oyl, a Greeniſh Liquor becomes Blew. The hint of this Experiment was given us by the practice of ſome <hi>Italian</hi> Painters, who being wont to Counterfeit <hi>Ultra-marine Azure</hi> (as they call it) by Grinding Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digreaſe with Sal-Armoniack, and ſome other Saline Ingredients, and letting them Rot (as they imagine) for a good while together in a Dunghill, we ſuppos'd, that the change of Colour wrought in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digreaſe by this way of Preparation, muſt proceed from the Action of certain Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile and Alcalizate Salts, abounding in ſome of the mingled Concretes, and brought to make a further Diſſolution of the Copper abounding in the Verdigreaſe, and therefore we Conjectur'd, that if both the Verdigreaſe, and ſuch Salts were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in fair Water, the ſmall Parts of both being therein more ſubdivided, and ſet at liberty, would have better acceſs to each other, and thereby Incorporate much the more ſuddenly; And accordingly we found, that if upon a ſtrong Solution of good French Verdigreaſe (for 'tis that we
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56394:150"/>
are wont to imploy, as the beſt) you pour a juſt quantity of Oyl of Tartar, and ſhake them well together, you ſhall immediately ſee a notable Change of Colour, and the Mixture will grow thick, and not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, but if you ſtay a while, till the Groſſer part be Precipitated to, and ſetled in the Bottom, you may obtain a clear Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of a very lovely Colour, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding delightfull to the Eye. But, you muſt have a care to drop in a competent Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Oyl of Tartar, for elſe the Colour will not be ſo Deep, and Rich; and if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this Oyl you imploy a clear <hi>Lixivium</hi> of Pot-aſhes, you may have an Azure ſomewhat Lighter or Paler than, and therefore differing from, the former. And if inſtead of either of theſe Liquors, you make uſe of Spirit of Urine, or of Harts-horn, you may according to the Quantity and Quality of the Spirit you pour in, obtain ſome further Variety (though ſcarce conſiderable) of Caeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leous Liquors. And yet lately by the help of this Urinous Spirit we made a Blew Liquor, which not a few Ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and among them, ſome, whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion makes them very Converſant with Colours, have looked upon with ſome wonder.

ſhould be freed from the Subſiding matter, which the Salts of Tartar or Urine precipitate out of them, rather by being Decanted, than by Filtration.

And, though the deſign of this Diſcourſe be the Improvement of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not of Trades: yet thus much I ſhall not ſcruple to intimate here, That the Blew Liquors, mention'd in the twentieth and one and twentieth Experiments, are fat from being the only Vegetable Subſtances, upon which Acid, Urinous, and Alcalizate Salts have the like Operations to thoſe recited in thoſe two Experiments. For Ripe <hi>Privet Berries</hi> (for inſtance) being cruſh'd

upon White Paper, though they ſtain it with a Purpliſh Colour, yet if we let fall on ſome part of it two or three drops of Spirit of Salt, and on the other part a little more of the ſtrong Solution of Pot-aſhes, the former Liquor immediately turn'd that part of the Thick Juice or Pulp, on which it fell, into a lovely Red, and the latter turn'd the other part of it into a delightfull Green.

For, I have found this Experiment to ſucceed in ſo many Various Berries, Flowers, Bloſſoms, and other finer Parts of Vegetables, that neither my Memory, nor my Leiſure ſerves me to enumerate them. And it is ſomewhat ſurprizing to ſee, by how Differingly-colour'd Flowers, or Bloſſoms, (for example) the Paper being

To which let us add, That either of thoſe new Pigments (if I may ſo call them) may by the Affuſion of enough of a contrary Liquor, be preſently chang'd from Red into Green, and from Green into Red, which Obſervation will hold alſo in Syrrup of Violets; Juices of Blew-bottles, &amp;c.</p>

But Spirit of Urine, and ſomewhat more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually a ſtrong Alcalizate Solution, did immediately turn the almoſt Colourleſs Paper moiſten'd by the Juice of the <hi>Jaſmin,</hi> not as thoſe Liquors are wont to do, when put upon the Juices of other Flowers, of a good Green, but of a Deep, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Greeniſh Yellow, which Experiment I did afterwards at ſeveral times repeat with the like ſucceſs. But it ſeems not that a great degree of Unctuouſneſs is neceſſary to the Production of the like Effects, for when we try'd the Experiment with the Leaves of thoſe purely White Flowers that appear about the end of Winter, and are commonly call'd <hi>Snow drops,</hi> the event, was not much unlike that, which, we have been newly mentioning.</p>

Only in ſome early Prim-roſes it deſtroy'd the greateſt part of the Colour, and made the Paper almoſt White agen.

                           <p>Having thus <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> given you divers Inſtances, to countenance the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obſervation deliver'd in the twenty fifth Experiment, and divers Exceptions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ought to be Limited; I muſt leave the further Inquiry into theſe Matters to your own Induſtry. For not remembring at preſent many of thoſe other Trials, long ſince made to ſatisfie my ſelf about Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and not having now the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to repeat them, I muſt content my Self to have given you the Hint, and the ways of proſecuting the ſearch your Self; and only declare to you in general, that, As I have made many Trials, unmention'd in this Treatiſe, whoſe Events were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe mention'd in the twenty fifth Experiment, ſo (to name now no other Inſtances) what I have try'd with Acid and Sulphureous Salts upon the Pulp of Juniper Berries, rubb'd upon White Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, inclines me to think, That among that vaſt Multitude, and ſtrange Variety of Plants that adorn the face of the Earth, perhaps many other Vegetables may be found, on which ſuch <hi>Menſtruums</hi> may not
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56394:157"/>

It ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ev'n by theſe, that the effects of a Salt upon the Juices of particular Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables do very much depend upon their particular Textures.</p>

                        <p>It may be of ſome Uſe towards the diſcovery of the nature of theſe Changes, which the Alimental Juice receives in ſome Vegetables, according to the differing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of their Maturity, and according to the differing kinds of Plants of the ſame Denomination, to obſerve what Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Acid, Urinous, and Alcalizate Salts will have upon the Juices of the ſeveral ſorts of the Vegetable Subſtances I have been mentioning.</p>
                        <p>To declare my meaning by an Example, I took from the ſame Cluster, one Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry full Ripe, and another that had not yet gone beyond a Redneſs, and rubbing a piece of White Paper, with the former, I obſerv'd, that the Juice adhering to it was of a dark Reddiſh Colour, full of little
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56394:158"/>
Black Specks, and that this Juice by a drop of a ſtrong <hi>Lixivium,</hi> was immediately turn'd into a Greeniſh Colour deep enough, by as much Urinous Spirit into a Colour much of Kin to the former, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differing, and fainter; and by a drop of Spirit of Salt into a fine and lightſome Red: where as the Red Berry being in like manner rubb'd upon Paper, left on it a Red Colour, which was very little alter'd by the Acid Spirit newly nam'd, and by the Urinous and Lixiviate Salts receiv'd changes of Colour differing from thoſe that had been juſt before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in the dark Juice of the Ripe Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry.</p>
                        <p>I remember alſo, that though the Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Damask-Roſes would as well, though not ſo much, as that of Red; be heightned by Acid Spirits to an intenſe degree of Redneſs, and by Lixiviate Salts be brought to a Darkiſh Green; yet having for Trials ſake taken a Roſe, whoſe Leaves, which were large and numerous, like thoſe of a Province Roſe, were perfectly Yellow, though in a Solution of Salt of Tartar, they afforded a Green Blewiſh Tincture, yet I did not by an Acid Liquor obtain a Red one; all that the Saline Spirit I imploy'd, perform'd, being (if I much miſ-remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56394:158"/>
not) to Dilute ſomewhat the Yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Leaves. I would alſo have tried the Tincture of Yellow Violets, but could procure none. And if I were in thoſe Iſlands of <hi>Banda,</hi> which are made Famous as well as Rich, by being the almoſt only places, where Cloves will proſper, I ſhould think it worth my Curioſity to try, what Operation the three differing Kinds of Salts, I have ſo often mention'd, would have upon the Juice of this Sipce, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd at the ſeveral Seaſons of it) as it grows upon the Tree. Since good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors inform us, (of what is remarkable) that theſe whether Fruits, or Rudiments of Fruits, are at firſt <hi>white,</hi> afterward <hi>Green,</hi> and then <hi>Reddiſh,</hi> before they be beaten off the Tree, after which being Dry'd before they are put up, they grow <hi>Blackiſh</hi> as we ſee them. And one of the recenteſt <hi>Herbariſts</hi> informs us, that the Flower grows upon the top of the Clove it ſelf, conſiſting of four ſmall Leaves, like a Cherry Bloſſom, but of an excellent <hi>Blew.</hi> But <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> to return to our own Obſervations, I ſhall add, that I the rather chooſe, to mention to you an Example drawn from Roſes, becauſe that though I am apt to think, as I elſewhere advertiſe, that ſomething may be gueſs'd at about
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56394:159"/>
ſome of the Qualities of the Juices of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, by the Reſemblance or Diſparity that we meet with in the Changes made of their Colours, by the Operation of the ſame kinds of Salts; yet that thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures ſhould be very warily made, may appear among other things, by the Inſtance I have choſen to give in Roſes. For though, (as I formerly told you) the Dry'd Leaves, both of the Damask, and of Red ones, give a Red Tincture to Water ſharpen'd with Acid Salts, yet the one ſort of Leaves is known to have <note place="margin">See <hi>Parkinſon</hi> Th. Botan. Trib. 9. cap. 26.</note> a Purgative faculty, and the other are often, and divers ways, imploy'd for Binding.</p>
                        <p>And I alſo chooſe <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn this twenty ninth Experiment to thoſe that precede it, about the change of the Colours of Vegetables by Salts, for theſe two reaſons: The firſt, that you may not eaſily entertain Suſpitions, if in the Trials of an Experiment of ſome of the Kinds formerly mention'd, you ſhould meet with an Event ſomewhat differing from what my Relations may have made you expect. And the ſecond, That you may hereby be invited to diſcern, that it may not be amiſs to take notice of the particular Seaſons wherein you gather the Vegetables which
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56394:159"/>
in Nicer Experiments you make uſe of. For, if I were not hindred both by haſte and ſome juſtifiable Conſiderations, I could perhaps add conſiderable Inſtances, to thoſe lately deliver'd, for the making out of this Obſervation; but for certain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I ſhall at preſent ſubſtitute a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſage to be met with in that Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Herbariſt Mr. <hi>Parkinſon,</hi> where treating of the Virtues of the (already divers times mention'd) Buckthorn Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he ſubjoyns the following account of ſeveral Pigments that are made of them, not only according to the ſeveral ways of Handling them, but according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Seaſons of Maturity, at which they are Gather'd; <hi>Of theſe Berries,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are made three ſeveral ſorts of Colours as they ſhall be gather'd, that is, being gather'd while they are Green, and kept Dry, are call'd Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, which being ſteep'd into ſome Allom-water, or freſh bruis'd into Allom-water, they give a reaſonable fair Yellow Colour which Painters uſe for their Work, and Book-binders to Colour the edges of Books, and Leather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers to Colour Leather, as they uſe alſo to make a Green Colour, call'd Sap-green, taken from the Berries when they are Black, being bruis'd and put into a Braſs or Copper Kettle or Pan, and there ſuffer'd to abide three or four
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:56394:160"/>
Days, or a little heated upon the Fire, and ſome beaten Allom put unto them, and afterwards preſs'd forth, the Juice or Liquor is uſually put in great Bladders tied with ſtrong thred at the Head and hung up untill it be Dry, which is diſſolv'd in Water or Wine, but Sack</hi> (he affirms) <hi>is the best to preſerve the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour from Starving, (as they call it) that is, from Decaying, and make it hold freſh the longer. The third Colour (where of none</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that I can find have made mention but only</hi> Tragus) <hi>is a Purpliſh Colour, which is made of the Berries ſuffer'd to grow upon the Buſhes untill the middle or end of</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, <hi>that they are ready to drop from the Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And, I remember <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> that I try'd, with a ſucceſs that pleas'd me well enough, to make ſuch a kind of Pigment, as Painters call Sap-green, by a way not unlike that, deliver'd here by our Author, but I cannot now find any thing relating to that matter among my looſe Papers. And my Trials were made ſo many years ago, that I dare not truſt my Memory for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, but will rather tell you, that in a noted Colour-ſhop, I brought them by Queſtions to confeſs to me, that they made their Sap-green much after the ways by our <hi>Botaniſt</hi> here mention'd. And on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56394:160"/>
I ſhall add an Obſervation, which though it does not ſtrictly belong to this place, may well enough be mention'd here, namely, that I find by an account given us by the Learned <hi>Cluſius,</hi> of <hi>Alaternus,</hi> that even the Groſſer Parts of the ſame Plant, are ſome of them one Colour, and ſome another; For ſpeaking of that Plant, he tells us, that the <hi>Portugalls</hi> uſe the Bark to Dye their Nets into a Red Colour, and with the Chips of the Wood, which are Whitiſh, they Dye a Blackiſh Blew.</p>

                        <p>Among the Experiments that tend to ſhew that the change of Colours in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may proceed from the Vary'd Texture of their Parts, and the conſequent change of their Diſpoſition to Reflect or Refract the Light, that ſort of Experiments muſt not be left unmention'd, which is afforded us by Chymical Digeſtions. For, if <hi>Chymiſts</hi> will believe ſeveral famous Writers about what they call the Philoſophers Stone, they muſt acknowledge that the ſame Matter, ſeald up Hermetically in a Philoſophical Egg, will by the continuance of Digeſtion, or if they will have it ſo (for it is not Material in our caſe which of the two it be)

of Decoction, run through a great Variety of differing Colours, before it come to that of the Nobleſt <hi>Elixir;</hi> whether that be Scarlet, or Purple, or what ever other Kind of Red. But without building any thing on ſo Obtruſe and Queſtionable an Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, (which yet may be pertinently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to thoſe that believe the thing) we may obſerve, that divers Bodies digeſted in carefully-clos'd Veſſels, will in tract of time, change their Colour: As I have elſewhere mention'd my having obſerv'd ev'n in Rectify'd Spirit of Harts-horn, and as is evident in the Precipitations of Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gams of Gold, and Mercury, without Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, where by the continuance of a due Heat the Silver-Colour'd Amalgam is reduc'd into a ſhining Red Powder. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtances of this Kind you may find here and there in divers places of my other Eſſays. And indeed it has been a thing, that has much contributed to deceive many <hi>Chymists,</hi> that there are more Bodies than one, which by Digeſtion will be brought to exhibit that Variety and Succeſſion of Colours, which they imagine to be Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to what they call the <hi>True matter of the Philoſophers.</hi> But concerning this, I ſhall referr you to what you may elſewhere find in the Diſcourſe written touching the

paſſive Deceptions of <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> and more about the Production of Colours by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion you will meet with preſently. Wherefore I ſhall now make only this Obſervation from what has been deliver'd, That in theſe Operations there appears not any cauſe to attribute the new Colours emergent to the Action of a new Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial form, nor to any Increaſe or Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of either the Salt, Sulphur, or Mercury of the Matter that acquires new Colours: For the Veſſels are clos'd, and theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples according to the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> are Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable and Incorruptible; ſo that the Effect ſeems to proceed from hence, that the Heat agitating and ſhuffling the Corpuſcles of the Body expos'd to it, does improceſs of time ſo change its Texture, as that the Tranſpoſed parts do Modifie the incident Light otherwiſe, than they did when the Matter appear'd of another Colour.</p>

                        <p>Among the ſeveral changes of Colour; which Bodies acquire or diſcloſe by Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, it it very remarkable, that <hi>Chymiſts</hi> find a Redneſs rather than any other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in moſt of the Tinctures they Draw, and ev'n in the more Groſs Solutions they
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56394:162"/>
make of almoſt all Concretes, that abound either with Mineral or Vegetable Sulphur, though the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> imploy'd about theſe Solutions or Tinctures be never ſo Limpid or Colourleſs.</p>
                        <p>This we have obſerv'd in I know not how many Tinctures drawn with Spirit of Wine from <hi>Jalap, Guaicum,</hi> and ſeveral other Vegetables; and not only in the Solutions of <hi>Amber, Benzoin,</hi> and divers other Concretes made with the ſame <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,</hi> but alſo in divers Mineral Tinctures. And, not to urge that familiar Inſtance of the Ruby of Sulphur, as <hi>Chymiſts</hi> upon the ſcore of its Colour, call the Solution of Flowers of Brimſtone, made with the Spirit of Turpentine, nor to take notice of other more known Examples of the apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chymical Oyls, to produce a Red Colour with the Sulphur they extract, or diſſolve; not to inſiſt (I ſay) upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this nature, I ſhall further repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you, as a thing remarkable, that, both Acid and Alcalizate Salts, though in moſt other caſes of ſuch contrary Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in reference to Colours, will with many Bodies that abound with Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous, or with Oyly parts, produce a Red; as is manifeſt partly in the more Vulgar Inſtances of the Tinctures, or Solutions of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56394:162"/>
Sulphur made with <hi>Lixiviums,</hi> either of Calcin'd Tartar or Pot-aſhes, and other Obvious examples, partly by this, that the true Glaſs of Antimony extracted with ſome Acid Spirits, with or without Wine, will yield a Red Tincture, and that I know an Acid Liquor, which in a moment will turn Oyl of Turpentine into a deep Red. But among the many Inſtances I could give you of the eaſie Production of Redneſs by the Operation of Saline Spirit, as well as of Spirit of Wine; I remember two or three of thoſe I have tried, which ſeem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable enough to deſerve to be mention'd to you apart.</p>

                        <p>That there ſeems to be a manifeſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity betwixt Red Liquors, ſo that ſome of them may be ſaid to have a Genuine Redneſs in compariſon of others, that have a Yellowiſh Redneſs: For if you take (for example) a good Tincture of <hi>Chochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neel,</hi> dilute it never ſo much with fair Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you will not (as far as I can judge by what I have tried) be able to make it a Yellow Liquor. Inſomuch that a Single
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56394:163"/>
drop of a rich Solution of <hi>Cochineel</hi> in Spirit of Urine, being Diluted with above an Ounce of fair Water, exhibited no Yellowiſhneſs at all, but a fair (though ſomewhat faint) Pinck or Carnation; and even when <hi>Cochineel</hi> was by degrees Diluted much beyond the newly mention'd Colour, by the way formerly related to you in the twenty fourth Experiment, I remember not, that there appear'd in the whole Trial any Yellow. But if you take Balſom of Sulphur (for Inſtance) though it may appear in a Glaſs, where it has a good Thickneſs, to be of a deep Red, yet if you ſhake the Glaſs, or pour a few drops on a ſheet of White Paper, ſpreading them on it with your Finger, the Balſom that falls back along the ſides of the Glaſs, and that which ſtains the Paper, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Yellow, not Red. And there are divers Tinctures, ſuch as that of Amber made with Spirit of Wine, (to name now no more) that will appear either Yellow or Red, according as the Veſſels that they fill, are Slender or Broad.</p>

For a fading Leaf, that is ready to Rot, and moulder into Duſt, may have as true a Yellow, as a Wedge of Gold, which ſo obſtinately reſiſts both Time and Fire. And the reaſon, why I take occaſion from the former Experiment to ſubjoyn this general Advertiſement, is, that I have ſeveral times obſerv'd, that the Mixture reſulting from the Oyls of Vitriol, and of Anniſeeds, though it acquire a thicker conſiſtence than either of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients had, has quickly loſt its Colour, turning in a very ſhort time into a dirty Gray, at leaſt in the Superficial parts, where 'tis expos'd to the Air; which laſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I therefore mention, becauſe that, though it ſeem probable, that this Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Colours may oft times and in divers caſes proceed from the further Action of the Saline Corpuſcles, and the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients upon one another, yet in many caſes much of the Quick change of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours ſeems aſcribeable to the Air, as may be made probable by ſeveral reaſon: The firſt whereof may be fetcht from the newly recited Example of the two Oyls; The next may be, that we have ſometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56394:165"/>
long Window-Curtains of light Colours, to have that part of them, which was expos'd to the Air, when the Window, was open, of one Colour, and the lower part, that was ſheltred from the Air by the Wall, of another Colour: And the third Argument may be fetch'd from divers Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, both of others, and our own; For of that Pigment ſo well known in Painters Shops, by the name of <hi>Turnſo,</hi> our Induſtrious <hi>Parkinſon,</hi> in the particular account he gives of the Plant that bears it, tells us alſo, That <hi>the Berries when they are at their full Maturity, have within them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the outer Skin and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56394:166"/>
differing, ſerves to prove the ſame thing; for having taken of the deeply Red Juice of <hi>Buckthorn</hi> Berries, which I bought of the Man that uſes to ſell it to the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, to make their Syrrup <hi>de Spina Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina,</hi> I let ſome of it drop upon a piece of White Paper, and having left it there for many hours, till the Paper was grown dry again, I found what I was inclin'd to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, namely, That this Juice was dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from a deep Red to a dirty kind of Greyiſh Colour, which, in a great part of the ſtain'd Paper ſeem'd not to have ſo much as an Eye of Red: Though a little Spirit of Salt or diſſolv'd <hi>Alcaly</hi> would turn this unpleaſant Colour (as formerly I told you it would change the not yet alter'd Juice) into a Red or Green. And to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my ſelf, that this Degeneration of Colour did not proceed from the Paper, I drop'd ſome of the deep Red or Crimſon Juice upon a White glaz'd Tile, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to dry on there, I found that ev'n in that Body, on which it could not Soak, and by which it could not be Wrought, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs loſt its Colour. And theſe Inſtances <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> I am the more carefull to mention to you, that you may not be much Surpris'd or Diſcourag'd, if you ſhould ſometimes miſs of performing
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56394:166"/>
punctually what I affirm my ſelf to have done in point of changing Colours; ſince in theſe Experiments the over-ſight or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of ſuch little Circumſtances, as in many others would not be perhaps conſiderable, may occaſion the miſ-carrying of a Trial. And I was willing alſo to take this occaſion of Advertiſing you in the repeating of the Experiments mention'd in this Treatiſe, to make uſe of the Juices of Vegetables, and other things prepar'd for your Trials, as ſoon as ever they are ready, leſt one or other of them grow leſs fit, if not quite unfit by delay; and to eſtimate the Event of the Trials by the Change, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd preſently upon the due and ſufficient Application of Actives to Paſſives, (as they ſpeak) becauſe in many caſes the effects of ſuch Mixtures may not be laſting, and the newly produc'd Colour may in a little time degenerate. But, <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to add to the two former Obſervations lately made about Vegetables, a third of the ſame Import, made in Mineral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by telling you, That the better to ſatisfie a Friend or two in this particular, I ſometimes made, according to ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures of mine, this Experiment; That having diſſolv'd good Silver in <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and Precipitated it with Spirit of Salt, upon
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56394:167"/>
the firſt Decanting of the Liquor, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Matter would be purely White; but after it had lain a while uncover'd, that part of it, that was Contiguous to the Air, would not only loſe its Whiteneſs, but appear of a very Dark and almoſt Blackiſh Colour, I ſay that part that was Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the Air, becauſe if that were gently taken off, the Subjacent part of the ſame Maſs would appear very White, till that alſo, having continu'd a while expos'd to the Air, would likewiſe Degenerate. Now whether the Air perform theſe things by the means of a Subtile Salt, which we elſwhere ſhow it not to be deſtitute of, or by a peircing Moiſture, that is apt eaſily to inſinuate it ſelf into the Pores of ſome Bodies, and thereby change their Texture, and ſo their Colour: Or by ſolliciting the Avolation of certain parts of the Bodies, to which 'tis Contiguous; or by ſome other way, (which poſſibly I may elſewhere propoſe and conſider) I have not now the leiſure to diſcourſe. And for the ſame reaſon, though I could add many other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of what I formerly noted touching the emergency of Redneſs upon the Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of many Bodies, inſomuch that I have often ſeen upon the Borders of <hi>France</hi> (and probably we may have the like in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:56394:167"/>
                           <hi>England)</hi> a ſort of Pears, which digeſted for ſome time with a little Wine, in a Veſſel exactly clos'd, will in not many hours appear throughout of a deep Red Colour, (as alſo that of the Juice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are Stew'd, becomes) but ev'n on pure and white Salt of Tartar, pure Spirit of Wine, as clear as Rock-water, will (as we elſewhere declare) by long Digeſtion acquire a Redneſs; Though I ſay ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be Multiply'd, and though there be ſome other Obvious changes of Colours, which happen ſo frequently, that they cannot but be as well Conſiderable as Notorious; ſuch as is the Blackneſs of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Bodies burn'd in the open Air: yet our haſte invites us to reſign you the Exerciſe of enquiring into the Cauſes of theſe Changes. And certainly, the reaſon both <hi>why</hi> the Soots of ſuch differing Bodies are almoſt all of them all Black, <hi>why</hi> ſo much the greater part of Vegetables ſhould be rather Green than of any other Colour, and particularly (which more directly concerns this place) <hi>why</hi> gentle Heats do ſo frequently in Chymical Operations produce rather a Redneſs than another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in digeſted <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> not only Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous, as Spirit of Wine, but Saline, as Spirit of Vinegar, may be very well worth

                        <p>It may ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange, that if you take the Crimſon Solution of <hi>Cochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neel,</hi> or the Juice of Black Cherries, and of ſome other Vegetables that afford the like Colour, (which becauſe many take but for a deep Red, we do with them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times call it ſo) and let ſome of it fall upon a piece of Paper, a drop or two of an Acid Spirit, ſuch as Spirit of Salt, or <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> will immediately turn it into a fair Red. Whereas if you make an Infuſion of Brazil in fair Water, and drop a little Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt or <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> into it, that will deſtroy its Redneſs, and leave the Liquor of a Yellow, (ſometimes Pale) I might perhaps plauſibly enough ſay on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that if we conſider the caſe a little more attentively, we may take notice, that the action of the Acid Spirit ſeems in both caſes, but to weaken the Colour of the Liquor on which it falls. And ſo though it deſtroy Redneſs in the Tincture of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil, as well as produce Red in the Tincture of <hi>Chochineel,</hi> its Operations may be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:56394:168"/>
enough, ſince as Crimſon ſeems to be little elſe than a very deep Red, with (perhaps) an Eye of Blew, ſo ſome kinds of Red ſeem (as I have lately noted) to be little elſe than heightned Yellow. And conſequently in ſuch Bodies, the Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſeems to be but a diluted Red. And accordingly Alcalizate Solutions and Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Spirits, which ſeem diſpos'd to Deepen the Colours of the Juices and Liquors of moſt Vegetables, will not only reſtore the Solution of <hi>Cochineel</hi> and the Infuſion of Brazil to the Crimſon, whence the Spirit of Salt had chang'd them into a truer Red; but will alſo (as I lately told you) not only heighthen the Yellow Juice of Madder into Red, but advance the Red Infuſion of Brazil to a Crimſon. But I know not whether it will not be much ſafer to derive theſe Changes from vary'd Textures, than certain kinds of Bodies; and you will perhaps think it worth while, that I ſhould add on this occaſion, That it may deſerve ſome Speculation, why, notwithſtanding what we have been obſerving, though Blew and Purple ſeem to be deeper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours than Red, and therefore the Juices of Plants of either of the two former Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours may (congruouſly enough to what has been juſt now noted) be turn'd Red by
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:56394:169"/>
Spirit of Salt or <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> yet Blew Syrrup of Violets and ſome Purples ſhould both by Oyl of Tartar and Spirit of Urine be chang'd into Green, which ſeems to be not a deeper but a more diluted Colour than Blew, if not alſo than Purple.</p>

                        <p>It would much contribute to the Hiſtory of Colours, if <hi>Chymiſts</hi> would in their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratories take a heedfull notice, and give us a faithfull account of the Colours ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the Steams of Bodies either Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim'd or Diſtill'd, and of the Colours of thoſe Productions of the Fire, that are made up by the Coalition of thoſe Steams. As (for Inſtance) we obſerve in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling of pure Salt-peter, that at a certain ſeaſon of the Operation, the Body, though it ſeem either Cryſtalline, or White, affords very Red Fumes: whereas though Vitriol be Green or Blew, the Spirit of it is obſerv'd to come over in Whitiſh Fumes. The like Colour I have taken notice of in the Fumes of ſeveral other Concretes of differing Colours, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, eſpecially when Diſtill'd with ſtrong Fires. And we elſewhere note, that ev'n Soot, as Black as it is, has fill'd our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:56394:169"/>
with ſuch copious White Fumes, that they ſeem'd to have had their In-ſides waſh'd with Milk. And no leſs obſervable may be, the Diſtill'd Liquors, into which ſuch Fumes convene, (for though we will not deny, that by skill and care a Reddiſh Liquor may be obtain'd from Nitte) yet the common Spirit of it, in the making ev'n of which ſtore of theſe Red Fumes are wont to paſs over into the Receiver, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not to be at all Red. And beſides, that neither the Spirit of Vitriol, nor that of Soot is any thing White; And, beſides alſo, that as far as I have obſerv'd, moſt (for I ſay not all) of the Empyreuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Oyls of Woods, and other Concretes, are either of a deep Red, or of a Colour between Red and Black; beſides this, I ſay, 'tis very remarkable, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that great Variety of Colours to be met with in the Herbs, Flowers, and other Bodies wont to be Diſtill'd in <hi>Balneo:</hi> yet (as far at leaſt as our common Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillers Experience reacheth) all the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Spirits that firſt come over by that way of Diſtillation, leave the Colours of their Concretes behind them, though indeed there be one or two Vegetables not commonly taken notice of, whoſe Diſtill'd Liquors I elſewhere obſerve to carry over
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:56394:170"/>
the Tincture of the Concrete with them. And as in Diſtillations, ſo in Sublimations, it were worth while to take notice of what comes up, in reference to our preſent ſcope, by purpoſely performing them (as I have in ſome caſes done) in conveniently ſhap'd Glaſſes, that the Colour of the aſcending Fumes may be diſcern'd; For it may afford a Naturaliſt good Information to obſerve the Congruities or the Differences betwixt the Colours of the aſcending Fumes, and thoſe of the <hi>Flowers,</hi> they compoſe by their Convention. For it is evident, that theſe <hi>Flowers,</hi> do many of them in point of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, much differ, not only from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but oft times from the Concretes that afforded them. Thus, (not here to repeat what I formerly noted of the Black Soots of very differingly Colour'd Bodies) though Camphire and Brimſtone afford <hi>Flowers</hi> much of their own Colour, ſave that thoſe of Brimſtone are wont to be a little Paler, than the Lumps that yielded them; yet ev'n of Red <hi>Benzoin,</hi> that ſublim'd Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which <hi>Chymiſts</hi> call its <hi>Flowers,</hi> is wont to be White or Whitiſh. And to omit other Inſtances, ev'n one and the ſame Black Mineral, Antimony, may be made to afford <hi>Flowers,</hi> ſome of them Red, and ſome Grey, and, which is more ſtrange,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56394:170"/>
ſome of them purely White. And 'tis the Preſcription of ſome Glaſs-men by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely mingling a convenient proportion of Brimſtone, Sal-Armoniack, and Quick-ſilver, and Subliming them together, to make a Sublimate of an excellent Blew; and though having caus'd the Experiment to be made, we found the produc'd Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to be far from being of a lovely Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, (as was promis'd) that there and there, it ſeem'd Blewiſh, and at leaſt was of a Colour differing enough from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Ingredients, which is ſufficient for our preſent purpoſe. But a much finer Colour is promis'd by ſome of the Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, that pretend to Secrets, who tell us, that Orpiment, being Sublim'd, will afford among the Parts of it that fly Upward, ſome little Maſſes, which, though the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral it ſelf be of a good Yellow, will be Red enough to emulate Rubies, both in Colour and Tranſlucency. And this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment may, for ought I know, ſometimes ſucceed; for I remember, that having in a ſmall Bolt-head purpoſely ſublim'd ſome powder'd Orpiment, we could in the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the Sublimate diſcern here and there ſome Reddiſh Lines, though much of the Upper part of the Sublimate conſiſted of a matter, which was not alone purely
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56394:171"/>
Yellow, but tranſparent almoſt like a Powder. And we have alſo this way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Sublimate, the Lower part whereof though it conſiſted not of Rubies, yet the ſmall pieces of it, which were Numerous enough, were of a pleaſant Reddiſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and Gliſter'd very prettily. But to inſiſt on ſuch kind of Trials and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, (where the aſcending Fumes of Bodies differ in Colour from the Bodies themſelves) though it might indeed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the Hiſtory of Colours, would Robb me of too much of the little time I have to diſpatch what I have further to tell you concerning them.</p>

                           <p>This Experiment may bring ſome Light to, and receive ſome from a couple of other Experiments, that I remember I have met with in the Ingenious <hi>Gaſſendus</hi>'s Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions upon <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Philoſophy, whilſt I was turning over the Leaves of thoſe Learned Commentaries; (my Eyes being too weak to let me read ſuch Voluminous Books quite thorough) And I the leſs ſcruple (notwithſtanding my contrary Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in this Treatiſe) to ſet down theſe Experiments of another, becauſe I ſhall a little improve the latter of them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by comparing there with that which I have laſt recited, we may be aſſiſted to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:56394:172"/>
upon what account it is, that Oyl of Vitriol heightens the Tincture of Red-roſe Leaves, ſince Spirit of Salt, which is a highly Acid <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> but otherwiſe differing enough from Oyl of Vitriol, does the ſame thing. Our Authors Experiments then, as we made them, are theſe; We took about a Glaſs-full of luke-warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in it immerg'd a quantity of the Leaves of <hi>Senna,</hi> and preſently upon the Immerſion there did not appear any Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Water, but dropping into it a little Oyl of Tartar, the Liquor ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd a Redneſs to the watchfull Eye, whereas by a little of that Acid Liquor of Vitriol, which is like the former, undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly called Oyl, ſuch a Colour would not be extracted from the infuſed <hi>Senna.</hi> On the other ſide we took ſome Red-roſe Leaves dry'd, and having ſhaken them into a Glaſs of fair Water, they imparted to it no Redneſs, but upon the affuſion of a little Oyl of Vitriol the Water was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately turn'd Red, which it would not have been, if inſtead of Oyl of Vitriol, we had imployed Oyl of Tartar to produce that Colour: That theſe were <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> his Experiments, I partly remember, and was aſſur'd by a Friend, who lately Tranſcribed them out of <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> his Book, which I
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56394:172"/>
therefore add, becauſe I have not now that Book at hand. And the deſign of <hi>Gaſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> in theſe Experiments our Friend affirms to be, to prove, that of things not Red a Redneſs may be made only by Mixture, and the Varied poſition of parts, wherein the Doctrine of that Subtil Philoſopher doth not a little Authorize, what we have formerly delivered concerning the Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency and Change of Colours. But the inſtances, that we have out of him ſet down, ſeem not to be the moſt Eminent, that may be produced of this truth: For our next Experiment will ſhew the production of ſeveral Colours out of Liquors, which have not any of them any ſuch Colour, nor indeed any diſcernable one at all; and whereas though our Author tells us, that there was no Redneſs either in the Water, or the Leaves of <hi>Senna,</hi> or the Oyl of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; And though it be true, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Colour of the Leaves of <hi>Senna</hi> be another than Red, yet we have try'd, that by ſteeping that Plant a Night even in Cold water, it would afford a very deep Yellow or Reddiſh Tincture without the help of the Oyl of Tartar, which ſeems to do little more than aſſiſt the Water to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract more nimbly a plenty of that Red Tincture, wherewith the Leaves of <hi>Senna</hi>
                              <pb n="298" facs="tcp:56394:173"/>
do of themſelves abound, and having taken off the Tincture of <hi>Senna,</hi> made only with fair Water, before it grew to be Reddiſh, and Decanted it from the Leaves, we could not perceive, that by dropping ſome Oyl of Tartar into it, that Colour was conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though it were a little heightned into a Redneſs, which might have been expected, if the particles of the Oyl did eminently Co-operate, otherwiſe than we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, to the production of this Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                           <p>And as for the Experiment with Red-roſe Leaves, the ſame thing may be alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, for we found that ſuch Leaves by bare Infuſion for a Night and Day in fair Water, did afford us a Tincture bordering at leaſt upon Redneſs, and that Colour being conſpicuous in the Leaves themſelves, would not by ſome ſeem ſo much to be produc'd as to be extracted by the affuſion of Oyl of Vitriol. And the Experiment try'd with the dry'd Leaves of Damask-roſes ſucceeded but imperfectly, but that is indeed obſervable to our Authors purpoſe, that Oyl of Tartar will not perform in this Experiment what Oyl of Vitriol doth; but becauſe this laſt named Liquor is not ſo eaſily to be had, give me leave to Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you, that the Experiment will ſucceed,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:56394:173"/>
if Inſtead of it you imploy <hi>Aqua-fortis.</hi> And though ſome Trials of our own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made, and others eaſily deducible from what we have already deliver'd, about the different. Families and Operations of Salt, might enable us to preſent you an Experiment upon Red-roſe Leaves, more accommodated to our Authors purpoſe, than that which he hath given us; yet our Reverence to ſo Candid a Philoſopher, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us rather to improve his Experiment, than ſubſtitute another in its place. Take therefore of the Tincture of Red-roſe Leaves, (for with Damask-roſe Leaves the Experiment ſucceedeth not well) made as before hath been taught with a little Oyl of Vitriol, and a good quantity of fair Water, pour off this Liquor into a clear Vial, half fill'd with Limpid water, till the Water held againſt the Light have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d a competent Redneſs, without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing its Tranſparency, into this Tincture drop leiſurely a little good Spirit of Urine, and ſhaking the Vial, which you muſt ſtill hold againſt the Light, you ſhall ſee the Red Liquor immediately turn'd into a fine Greeniſh Blew, which Colour was not to be found in any of the Bodies, upon whoſe Mixture it emerg'd, and this Change is the more obſervable, becauſe in many Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56394:174"/>
the Degenerating of Blew into Red is uſual enough, but the turning of Red into Blew is very unfrequent. If at every drop of Spirit of Urine you ſhake the Vial containing the Red Tincture, you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully obſerve a pretty variety of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in the paſſage of that Tincture from a Red to a Blew, and ſometimes we have this way hit upon ſuch a Liquor, as being look't upon againſt and from the Light, did ſeem faintly to emulate the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Tincture of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum.</hi> And if you make the Tincture of Red-roſes very high, and without Diluting it with fair Water, pour on the Spirit of Urine, you may have a Blew ſo deep, as to make the Liquor Opacous, but being dropt upon White Paper the Colour will ſoon diſcloſe it ſelf. Alſo having made the Red, and conſequently the Blew Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture very Tranſparent, and ſuffer'd it to reſt in a ſmall open Vial for a Day or two, we found according to our Conjecture, that not only the Blew but the Red Colour alſo was Vaniſh'd; the clear Liquor being of a bright Amber Colour, at the bottom of which ſubſided a Light, but Copious fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culency of almoſt the ſame Colour, which ſeems to be nothing but the Tincted parts of the Roſe Leaves drawn out by the Acid
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56394:174"/>
Spirits of the Oyl of Vitriol, and Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the Volatile Salt of the Spirit of Urine, which makes it the more probable, that the Redneſs drawn by the Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, was at leaſt as well an extraction of the Tinging parts of the Roſes, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Redneſs; and laſtly, if you be deſtitute of Spirit of Urine, you may change the Colour of the Tincture of Roſes with many other Sulphureous Salts, as a ſtrong Solution of Pot-aſhes, Oyl of Tartar, &amp;c. which yet are ſeldome ſo free from Fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, as the Spirituous parts of Urine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes by repeated Diſtillation.</p>

                           <p>On this occaſion, I call to mind, that I found, a way of producing, though not the ſame kind of Blew, as I have been mentioning, yet a Colour near of Kin to it, namely, a fair Purple, by imploying a Liquor not made Red by Art, inſtead of the Tincture of Red-roſes, made with an Acid Spirit; And my way was only to take Log-wood, (a Wood very well known to Dyers) having by Infuſion the Powder of it a while in fair Water made that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor Red, I dropt into it a <hi>Tantillum</hi> of an Urinous Spirit, as that of Sal-Armoniack,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:56394:175"/>
(and I have done the ſame thing with an <hi>Alcali)</hi> by which the Colour was in a moment turn'd into a Rich, and lovely Purple. But care muſt be had, that you let not fall into a Spoonfull above two or three Drops, left the Colour become ſo deep, as to make the Liquor too Opacous. And (to anſwer the other part of <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> his Experiment) if inſtead of fair Water, I infus'd the Log-wood in Water made ſomewhat ſowr by the Acid Spirit of Salt, I ſhould obtain neither a Purple Liquor, nor a Red, but only a Yellow one.</p>

                        <p>The Experiment I am now to mention to you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> is that which both you, and all the other <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> that have ſeen it, have been pleas'd to think very ſtrange; and indeed of all the Experiments of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, I have yet met with, it ſeems to be the fitteſt to recommend the Doctrine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in this Treatiſe, and to ſhew that we need not ſuppoſe, that all Colours muſt neceſſarily be Inherent Qualities, flowing from the Subſtantial Forms of the Bodies they are ſaid to belong to, ſince by a bare Mechanical change of Texture in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute parts of Bodies, two Colours may in
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:56394:175"/>
a moment be Generated quite <hi>De novo,</hi> and utterly Deſtroy'd. For there is this difference betwixt the following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and moſt of the others deliver'd in theſe Papers, that in this, the Colour that a Body already had, is not chang'd into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but betwixt two Bodies, each of them apart devoid of Colour, there is in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment generated a very deep Colour, and which if it were let alone, would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent; and yet by a very ſmall Parcel of a third Body, that has no Colour of its own, (leſt ſome may pretend I know not what Antipathy betwixt Colours) this otherwiſe permanent Colour will be in another trice ſo quite Deſtroy'd, that there will remain no foot-ſtepts either of it or of any other Colour in the whole Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>The Experiment is very eaſie, and it is thus perform'd: Take good common Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate, and fully ſatiate with it what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water you pleaſe, Filtre the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion carefully through clean and cloſe Paper, that it may drop down as Clear and Colourleſs as Fountain water. Then when you'l ſhew the Experiment, put of it about a Spoonfull into a small Wine-glaſs, or any other convenient Veſſel made of clear Glaſs, and droping in three or four
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:56394:176"/>
drops of good Oyl of Tartar, <hi>per Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium,</hi> well Filtred that it may likewiſe be without Colour, theſe two Limpid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors will in the twinkling of an Eye turn into an Opacous mixture of a deep Orange Colour, which by keeping the Glaſs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſhaking in your hand, you muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from ſetling too ſoon to the Bottom; And when the Spectators have a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held this firſt Change, then you muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently drop in about four or five drops of Oyl of Vitriol, and continuing to ſhake the Glaſs pretty ſtrongly, that it may the Nimbler diffuſe it ſelf, the whole Colour, if you have gone Skilfully to work, will immediately diſappear, and all the Liquor in the Glaſs will be Clear and Colourleſs as before, without ſo much as a Sediment at the Bottom. But for the more gracefull Trial of this Experiment, 'twill not be amiſs to obſerve, Firſt, That there ſhould not be taken too much of the Solution of Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, nor too much of the Oyl of Tartar drop'd in, to avoid the neceſſity of putting in ſo much Oyl of Vitriol as may make an Ebullition, and perhaps run over the Glaſs. Secondly, That 'tis convenient to keep the Glaſs always a little ſhaking, both for the better mixing of the Liquors, and to keep the Yellow Subſtance from Subſiding, which
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:56394:176"/>
elſe it would in a ſhort time do, though when 'tis ſubſided it will retain its Colour, and alſo be capable of being depriv'd of it by the Oyl newly mention'd. Thirdly, That if any Yellow matter ſtick at the ſides of the Glaſs, 'tis but inclining the Glaſs, till the clarify'd Liquor can waſh alongſt it, and the Liquor will preſently imbibe it, and deprive it of its Colour.</p>
                        <p>Many have ſomewhat wondred, how I came to light upon this Experiment, but the Notions or Conjectures I have about the differing Natures of the ſeveral Tribes of Salts, having led me to deviſe the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, it will not be difficult for me to give you the Chymical Reaſon, if I may ſo ſpeak, of the <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> Having then obſerv'd, that <hi>Mercury</hi> being diſſolv'd in ſome <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> would yield a dark Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Precipitate, and ſuppoſing that, as to this, common Water, and the Salts that ſtick to the <hi>Mercury</hi> would be equivalent to thoſe Acid <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> which work upon the <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> upon the account of their Saline particles, I ſubſtituted a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Sublimate in fair Water, inſtead of a Solution of <hi>Mercury</hi> in <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> or Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> that ſimple Solution being both clearer and free from that very offenſive ſmell, which accompanies the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:56394:177"/>
of <hi>Mercury</hi> made with thoſe other corroſive Liquors; then I conſider'd, that That, which makes the Yellow Colour, is indeed but a Precipitate made by the means of the Oyl of Tartar, which we drop in, and which, as <hi>Chymiſts</hi> know, does gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally precipitate Metalline Bodies corroded by Acid Salts; ſo that the Colour in our caſe reſults from the Coalition of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial particles with the Saline ones, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were formerly aſſociated, and with the Alcalizate particles of the Salt of Tartar that ſwim up and down in the Oyl. Wherefore conſidering alſo, that very many of the effects of Lixiviate Liquors, upon the Solutions of other Bodies, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by Acid <hi>Menstruums,</hi> as I elſewhere more particularly declare, I concluded, that if I choſe a very potently Acid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which by its Inciſive power might undo the work of the Oyl of Tartar, and diſperſe again thoſe Particles, which the other had by Precipitation aſſociated, into ſuch minute Corpuſeles as were before ſingly Inconſpicuous, they would become Inconſpicuous again, and conſequently leave the Liquor as Colourleſs as before the Precipitation was made.</p>
                        <p>This, as I ſaid, <hi>Pyrophilus</hi> ſeems to be the Chymical reaſon of this Experiment, that
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:56394:177"/>
is ſuch a reaſon, as, ſuppoſing the truth of thoſe Chymical Notions I have elſewhere I hope evinc'd, may give ſuch an account of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> as Chymical Notions can ſupply us with; but I both here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where make uſe of this way of ſpeaking, to intimate that I am ſufficiently aware of the difference betwixt a Chymical Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> and one that is truly Philoſophical or Mechanical; as in our preſent caſe, I tell you ſomething, when I tell you that the Yellowneſs of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Solution, and the Oyl of Tartar is produc'd by the Precipitation occaſion'd by the affuſion of the latter of thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, and that the deſtruction of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour proceeds from the Diſſipation of that Curdl'd matter, whoſe Texture is deſtroy'd, and which is diſſolv'd into Minute and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible particles by the potently Acid <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,</hi> which is the reaſon, why there remains no Sediment in the Bottom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the infuſed Oyl takes it up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves it into hidden or inviſible Parts, as Water does Salt or Sugar. But when I have told you all this, I am far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have told all that ſuch an Inquiſitive Perſon as your ſelf would know, for I preſume you would deſire as well as I to learn (at leaſt) why the Particles of the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:56394:178"/>
                           <hi>Mercury,</hi> of the Tartar, and of the Acid Salts convening together, ſhould make ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Orange Colour than a Red, or a Blew, or a Green, for 'tis not enough to ſay what I related a little before, that divers Mercurial Solutions, though otherwiſe made, would yield a Yellow precipitate, becauſe the Queſtion will recurr concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and to give it a ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, is, I freely acknowledge, more than I dare as yet pretend to.</p>
                        <p>But to confirm my conjecture about the Chymical reaſon of our Experiment, I may add, that as I have <hi>(viz.</hi> pag. 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of this Treatiſe) elſewhere (on another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) told you, with Saline Liquors of another kind and nature than Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, (namely, with Spirit of Urine, and Liquors of kin to that) I can make the <hi>Mercury</hi> precipitate out of the firſt ſimple Solution quite of another Colour than that hitherto mention'd; Nay, if inſtead of altering the Precipitating Liquor, I alter'd the Texture of the Sublimate in ſuch a way as my Notions about Salt requir'd, I could produce the ſame <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> For having purpoſely Sublim'd together Equal parts (or thereabout) of Sal-Armoniack and Sublimate, firſt diligently Mix'd, the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Flowers being diſſolv'd in fair Water,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:56394:178"/>
and Filtred, gave a Solution Limpid and Colourleſs, like that of the other Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, and yet an <hi>Alcaly</hi> drop'd into this Liquor did not turn it Yellow but White. And upon the ſame Grounds we may with <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> without the help of common Sublimate, prepare another ſort of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers diſſoluble in Water without Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring it, with which I could likewiſe do what I newly mention'd; to which I ſhall add, (what poſſibly you'l ſomewhat won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at) That ſo much does the Colour depend upon the Texture reſulting from the Convention of the ſeveral ſorts of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſeles, that though in our Experiment, Oyl of Vitriol destroys the Yellow Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, yet with <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> and fair Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the help of Oyl of Vitriol alone, we may eaſily make a kind of Precipitate of a fair and permanent Yellow, as you will e're long (in the forty ſecond Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this third Part) be taught. And I may further add, that I choſe Oyl of Vitriol, not ſo much for any other or pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Quality, as for its being, when 'tis well rectify'd, (which 'tis ſomewhat hazardous to bring it to be) not only devoid of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and in Smells, but extremely Strong and Inciſive; For though common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dephlegmated <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> will not perform
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:56394:179"/>
the ſame thing well, yet that which is made exceeding Strong by being carefully De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegm'd, will do it pretty well, though not ſo well as Oyl of Vitriol which is ſo Strong, that even without Rectification it may for a need be made uſe of. I will not here tell you what I have try'd, that I may be able to deprive at pleaſure the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate that one of the Sulphureous Liquors had made, by the copious Affuſion of the other: Becauſe I found, though this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment is too tickliſh to let me give a full account of it in few words, I ſhall therefore tell you, that it is not only for once, that the other above-mention'd Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment may be made, the ſame Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical parcels of Liquor being ſtill imploy'd in it; for after I have Clarify'd the Orange Colour'd Liquor, by the addition of as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Oyl of Viriol as will ſuffice to perform the effect, I can again at pleaſure re-produce the Opacous Colour, by the dropping in of freſh Oyl of Tartar, and deſtroy it again by the Re-affuſion of more of the Acid <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> and yet oftner if I pleaſe, can I with theſe two contrariant Liquors recall and diſperſe the Colour, though by reaſon of the addition of ſo much new Liquor, in reference to the Mercurial particles, the Colour will at length appear more dilute and faint.</p>

                           <p>And, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to confirm yet further the Notions that led me to think on the propos'd Experiment, I ſhall acquaint you with another, which when I had conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency I have ſometimes added to it, and which has to the Spectators appear'd little leſs Odd than the firſt; And though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Liquor, requiſite to make the Trial ſucceed well, muſt be on purpoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd anew a while before, becauſe it will not long retain its fitneſs for this work, I do but ſeldome annex this Experiment to the other, yet I ſhall tell you how I devis'd it, and how I make it. If you boyl Crude Antimony in a ſtrong and clear <hi>Lixivium,</hi> you ſhall ſeparate a Subſtance from it, which ſome Modern <hi>Chymists</hi> are pleas'd to call its Sulphur, but how deſervedly I ſhall not here examine, having elſewhere done it in an Opportune place; wherefore I ſhall now but need to take notice, that when this ſuppos'd Sulphur (not now to call it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a kind of <hi>Crocus)</hi> is let fall by the Liquor upon its Refrigeration, it often ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in Flakes, or ſuch like parcels of a Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subſtance, (which being by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56394:180"/>
diſſolution reduc'd into Minute parts, may peradventure be made to take Fire much more eaſily than the Groſſer Powder of unprepar'd Antimony would have done.) Conſidering therefore, that common Sulphur boyl'd in a <hi>Lixivium</hi> may be Precipitated out of it by Rheniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine or White-wine, which are Sowriſh Liquors, and have in them, as I elſewhere ſhew, an Acid Salt; and having found alſo by Trial, that with other Acid Liquors I could Precipitate out of Lixiviate Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents ſome other Mineral concretions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with Sulphureons parts, of which ſort is crude Antimony, I concluded it to be eaſie to Precipitate the Antimony diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, as was lately mention'd, with the Acid Oyl of Vitriol; and though common Sulphur yields a White Precipitate, which the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> call <hi>Lac Sulphuris,</hi> yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Precipitated Antimony would be of a deep Yellow Colour, as well, if made with Oyl of Vitriol, as if made only by Refrigeration and length of Time. From this 'twas eaſie to deduce this Experiment, that if you put into one Glaſs ſome of the freſhly Impregnated and Filtrated Solution of Antimony, and into another ſome of the Orange-Colour'd Mixture, (which I formerly ſhew'd you how to make with a
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:56394:180"/>
Mercurial Solution and Oyl of Tartar) a few drops of Oyl of Vitriol dropp'd into the laſt mention'd Glaſs, would, as I told you before, turn the Deep Yellow mixture into a Cleer Liquor; whereas a little of the ſame Oyl dropp'd out of the ſame Viol into the other Glaſs would preſently (but not without ſome ill ſent) turn the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately cleer Solution into a Deep Yellow Subſtance. But this, as I ſaid, ſucceeds not well, unleſs you employ a <hi>Lixivium</hi> that has but newly diſſolv'd Antimony, and has not yet let it fall. But yet in Summer time, if your <hi>Lixivium</hi> have been duly Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and well Filtred after it is quite cold, it will for ſome dayes (perhaps much longer than I had occaſion to try) retain Antimony enough to exhibit, upon the Affuſion of the Corroſive Oyl, as much of a good Yellow Subſtance as is neceſſary to ſatisfie the Beholders of the Poſſibility of the Experiment.</p>

or <hi>Salſuginous</hi> (if I may for Diſtinction ſake ſo call the Fugitive Salts of Animal Subſtances) and <hi>fix d</hi> or <hi>Alcalizate,</hi> may poſſibly (by that little part which we have already deliver'd, of what we could ſay of its Applicableneſs) appear of ſo much Uſe in Natural Philoſophy (eſpecially in the Practick part of it) that I doubt not but it will be no Unwelcome Corollary of the Preceding Experiment, if by the help of it I teach you to diſtinguiſh, which of thoſe Salts is Predominant in Chymical Liquors, as well as whether any of them be ſo or not. For though in our Notes upon the X. and XX. Experiments I have ſhown you a way by means of the Tincture of <hi>Lignum Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phriticum,</hi> or of Syrrup of Violets, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover whether a propounded Salt be Acid or not, yet you can thereby only find in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that ſuch and ſuch Salts belong not to the Tribe of Acids, but cannot determine whether they belong to the Tribe of Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Salts (under which for diſtinction ſake I comprehend all thoſe Volatile Salts of Animal or other Subſtances that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Acids) or to that of Alcalies. For as well the one as the other of theſe Salino-Sulphurous Salts will reſtore the Caeruleous Colour to the Tincture of <hi>Lignum Nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum,</hi> and turn that of Syrrup of Violets
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:56394:181"/>
into Green. Wherefore this XL. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does opportunely ſupply the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of thoſe. For being ſollicitous to find out ſome ready wayes of diſcriminating the Tribes of Chymical Salts, I found that all thoſe I thought fit to make Tryal of, would, if they were of a Lixiviate Nature, make with Sublimate diſſolv'd in Fair Water an <hi>Orange Tawny</hi> Precipitate; whereas if they were of an Urinous Nature the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate would be <hi>White</hi> and Milky. So that having alwayes by me ſome Syrrup of Violets and ſome Solution of Sublimate, I can by the help of the firſt of thoſe Liquors diſcover in a trice, whether the propounded Salt or Saline Body be of an Acid Nature or no, if it be I need (you know) inquire no further; but if it be not, I can very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, and as readily diſtinguiſh between the other two kinds of Salts, by the White or Orange-Colour that is immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, by letting fall a few Drops or Grains of the Salt to be examin'd, into a ſpoonfull of the cleer Solution of Sublimate. For Example, it has been ſuppos'd by ſome eminently Learned, That when Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack being mingled with an Alcaly is forc'd from it by the Fire in cloſe Veſſels, the Volatile Salt that will thereby be obtain'd (if the Operation be skilfully perform'd,)
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:56394:182"/>
is but a more fine and ſubtile ſort of Sal Armoniack, which, 'tis preſum'd, this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration do's but more exquiſitely purifie, than common Solutions, Filtrations, and Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations. But this Opinion may be eaſily thown to be Erroneous, as by other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo particularly by the lately deliver'd Method of diſtinguiſhing the Tribes of Salts. For the Saline Spirit of Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, as it is in many other manifeſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities very like the Spirit of Urine, ſo like, that it will in a trice make Syrrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of a Lovely Green, turn a Solution of good Verdigreaſe into an Excellent Azure, and make the Solution of a Sublimate yield a White Precipitate, inſomuch that in moſt (for I ſay not all of the Experiments) where I Aim onely at producing a ſudden change of Colour, I ſcruple not to uſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sal Armoniack when it is at hand, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Spirit of Urine, as indeed it ſeems chiefly to conſiſt (beſides the flegm that helps to make it fluid) of the Volatile Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Salt (yet not excluding that of Soot) that abounds in the Sal Armoniack and is ſet at liberty from the Sea Salt wherewith it was formerly aſſociated, and clogg'd, by the Operation of the Alcaly, that divides the Ingredients of Sal Armoniack, and retains that Sea Salt with it ſelf. What uſe may be
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:56394:182"/>
made of the like way of exploration in that inquiry which puzzles ſo many Modern Naturaliſts, whether the Rich Pigment (which we have often had occaſion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) belongs to the Vegetable or Animal Kingdome, you may find in another place where I give you ſome account of what I try'd about Cocheneel. But I think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to exemplifie here our Method by any other Inſtances, many ſuch being to be met with in divers parts of this Treatiſe; but I will rather advertiſe you, that, by this way of examining Chymical Liquors, you may not onely in moſt Caſes conclude <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> but in ſome Caſes <hi>Negatively.</hi> As ſince Spirit of Wine, and as far as I have try'd, thoſe Chymical Oyles which Artiſts call Eſſential, did not (when I us'd them as I had us'd the ſeveral Families of Salts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Syrrup) turn Syrrup of Violets. Red or Green, nor the Solution of Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate White or Yellow, I inferr'd it may thence be probably argued, that either they are deſtitute of Salt, or have ſuch as belongs not to either of the three Grand families already often mention'd. When I went to examine the Spirit of Oak or of ſuch like Concretes forced over through a Retort, I found by this means amongſt others, that (as I elſewhere ſhow) thoſe Chymiſts are

much miſtaken in it, that account it a ſimple Liquor, and one of their Hypoſtatical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: for not to mention what flegm it may have, I found that with a few drops of one of this ſort of Spirits mix'd with a good proportion of Syrrup of Violets, I could change the Colour and make it Purpliſh, by the affinity of which Colour to Redneſs, I conjectur'd that this Spirit had ſome Acid Corpuſeles in it, and accordingly I found that as it would deſtroy the Blewneſs of a Tincture of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> ſo being put upon Corals it would Corrode them, as common Spirit of Vinegar, and other Acid Liquors are wont to do. And farther to examine whether there were not a great part of the Liquor that was not of an Acid nature, having ſeparated the Sour or Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-like part from the reſt, which (if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake not) is far the more Copious, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded as we had conjectured, the other or remaining part, though it had a ſtrong taſte as well as ſmell, to be of a nature differing from that of either of the three ſorts of Salts above mention'd, ſince it did as little as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, and Chymical Oyls, alter the Colour either of Syrrup of Violets or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Sublimate, whence we alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd that the change that had been made of that Syrrup into a Purple Colour, was
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:56394:183"/>
effected by the Vinegar, that was one of the two Ingredients of the Liquor, which was wont to paſs for a Simple or Uncompoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Spirit. And, upon this account, 'twas of the Spirit of Oak (and the like Concretes) freed from it's Vinegar that I elſewhere told you, that I had not then obſerv'd it, (and I have repeated the Tryal but very lately) to deſtroy the Caeruleous Tincture of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum.</hi> But this onely, <hi>en paſsant;</hi> for the Chief thing I had to add was this, That by the ſame way may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd and diſcover'd, divers changes that are produc'd in Bodies either by Nature only, or by Art; either of them being able by changing the Texture of ſome Concretes I could name, to qualifie them to Operate after a New manner upon the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Syrrup, or Solution, or both. And by this means, to tell you that upon the by, I have been able to diſcover, that there may be made Bodies, which though they run <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> as readily as Salt of Tartar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in other reſpects, not to the family of Alcaliz, much leſs to that of Salſuginous, or that of Acid Salts. Perhaps too, I may know a way of making a highly operative Saline Body that ſhall neither change the Colour of Syrrup of Violets, nor Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Solution of Sublimate; And, I can
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:56394:184"/>
likewiſe if I pleaſe conceal by what Liquors I perform ſuch changes of Colour, as I have been mentioning to you, by quite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Texture of ſome ordinary Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical productions, the Exploration of which is the main uſe of the fortieth Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, which I think teaches not a little, if it teach us to diſcover the nature of thoſe things (in reference to Salt) that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the ordinary Chymical Analyſis of mix'd Bodyes, though perhaps there may be other Bodyes prepar'd by Chymiſtry which may have the ſame Effects in the change of Colours; and yet be produc'd not from what Chymiſts call the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bodies, but from their Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the diſcourſing of things of this nature is more proper for another place. I ſhall now onely add, what might perhaps have been more ſeaſonably told you before; That the Reaſon why the way of Explora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Salts hitherto deliver'd, ſucceeds in the Solution of Sublimate, depends upon the particular Texture of that Solution, as well as upon the differing Natures of the Saline Liquors imploy'd to Precipitate it. For Gold diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> whether you Precipitate it with Oyl of Tartar which is an Alcaly, or with Spirit of Urne, or Sal Armoniack which belongs to the family of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:56394:184"/>
Volatile Salts, will either way afford a Yellow ſubſtance: though with ſuch an Acid Liquor, as, I ſay not Spirit of Salt, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that yields it, being upon the matter an Ingredient of <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> but Oyl of Vitriol it ſelf, I did not find that I could Precipitate the Metall out of the Solution; or deſtroy the Colour of it, though the ſame Oyl of Vitriol would readily Precipitate Silver diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua-fortis.</hi> And if you diſſolve pure Silver in <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and ſuffer it to ſhoot into Cryſtals, the cleer Solution of theſe made in fair Water, will afford a very White Precipitate, whether it be made with an Alcaly, or an Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as that of Salt, whereas, which may ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange, with Spirit of Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack (that I uſ'd was made of Quick-lime) I could obtain no ſuch White Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate; that Volatile Spirit, nor (as I remember) that of Urine, ſcarce doing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more than ſtriking down a very ſmall quantity of Matter, which was neither White nor Whitiſh, ſo that the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liquor being ſuffer'd to evaporate till the ſuperfluous Moiſture was gone, the greateſt part of the Metalline Corpuſcles with the Saline ones that had imbib'd them, concoagulated into Salt, as is uſual in ſuch Solutions, wherein the Metall has not been Precipitated.</p>

                           <p>This Experiment brings into my mind this other, which oftentimes ſucceeds well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, though not quite ſo well as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; Namely, that if into about a ſmall ſpoonfull of a Solution of good French Verdigreaſe made in fair Water, I drop't and ſhak'd ſome ſtrong Spirit of Salt, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deflegm'd <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> the Greenneſs of the Solution would be made in a trice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

But if into the other altogether or almoſt Colourleſs Liquor I was ſpeaking of, you drop a juſt quantity either of Oyl of Tartar or Spirit of Urine, you ſhall find that after the Ebullition is ceas'd, the mixture will diſcloſe a lively Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, though ſomewhat differing from that which the Solution of Verdigreaſe had at firſt.</p>

                        <p>That the Colour <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> of a Body may be chang'd by a Liquor which of it ſelf is of no Colour, provided it be Saline, we have already manifeſted by a multitude of inſtances. Nor doth it ſeem ſo ſtrange, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Saline Particles ſwimming up and down in Liquors, have been by many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be very operative in the Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and change of Colours. But divers of our Friends that are not acquainted with Chymical Operations have thought it very ſtrange that a White Body, and a Dry one

too, ſhould immediately acquire a rich new Colour upon the bare affuſion of Spring-Water deſtitute as well of adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Salt as of Tincture. And yet <hi>(Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus)</hi> the way of producing ſuch a change of Colours may be eaſily enough lighted on by thoſe that are converſant in the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mercury. For we have try'd, that though by Evaporating a Solution of Quick-Silver in <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and abſtracting the Liquor till the remaining matter began to be well, but not too ſtrongly dryed, fair Water pour'd on the remaining <hi>Calx</hi> made it but ſomewhat Yellowiſh; yet when we took good Quick-Silver, and three or four times its weight of Oyl of Vitriol, in caſe we in a Glaſs Retort plac'd in Sand drew off the Saline <hi>Menſtruum</hi> from the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Liquor, till there remain'd a dry <hi>Calx</hi> at the bottome, though this Precipitate were a Snow White Body, yet upon pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it a large quantity of fair Water, we did almoſt in a moment perceive it to paſs from a Milky Colour to one of the lovelieſt Light Yellows that ever we had beheld.

But though we have very rarely ſeen either in Painters Shops, or elſewhere a finer Yellow than that which we have divers times this way produc'd (which is the more conſiderable, becauſe durable and pleaſant Yellows are very hard to be met with, as may appear by the great uſe which Painters are for its Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours ſake fain to make of that pernicious and heavy Mineral, Orpiment) yet I fear our Yellow is too coſtly, to be like to be imploy'd by Painters, unleſs about Choice pieces of Work, nor do I know how well it will agree with every Pigment, eſpecially, with Oyl'd Colours. And whether this
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56394:187"/>
Experiment, though it have ſeem'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange to moſt we have ſhown it to, be really of another Nature than thoſe wherein Saline Liquors are imploy'd, may, as we formerly alſo hinted, be ſo plauſibly, doubted, that whether the Water pour'd on the <hi>Calx,</hi> do barely by imbibing ſome of its Saline parts alter its Colour by alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring its Texture, or whether by diſſolving the Concoagulated Salts, it does become a Saline <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and, as ſuch, work upon the Mercury, I freely leave to you <hi>(Pyrophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus)</hi> to conſider.

                        <p>We took good common Vitriol, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beaten it to Powder, and put it into a Crucible, we kept it melted in a gentle heat, till by the Evaporation of ſome parts, and the ſhuffling of the reſt, it had quite loſt its former Colour, what remain'd we took out, and found it to be a friable <hi>Calx,</hi> of a dirty Gray. On this we pour'd fair Water, which it did not Colour Green or Blew, but only ſeem'd to make a muddy mixture with it, then ſtopping the Vial wherein the Ingredients were put, we let it ſtand in a quiet place for ſome dayes, and after many hours the water having diſſolv'd a good part of the imperfectly calcin'd Body, the Yitriolate Corpuſcles ſwiming to and fro in the Liquor, had time by their opportune Occurſions to conſtitute many little Maſſes of Vitriol, which gave the water they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated a fair Vitriolate Colour; and this Liquor being pour'd off, the remaining dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Powder did in proceſs of time commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the like Colour, but not ſo deep, to a ſecond parcel of cleer Water that we pour'd on it.

                        <p>It may <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> ſomewhat contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards the ſhewing how much ſome Colours depend upon the leſs or greater mixture, and (as it were,) Contemperation of the Light with ſhades, to obſerve, how that ſometimes the number of Particles, of the ſame Colour, receiv'd into the Pores of a Liquor, or ſwimming up and down in it, do ſeem much to vary the Colour of it. I could here preſent you with particular inſtances to ſhow, how in many (if not moſt) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent Bodyes, if the Colour be not a Light one, as White, Yellow, or the like, the cloſeneſs of parts in the Pigments makes it look Blackiſh, though when it is diſplay'd and laid on thinly, it will perhaps appear to be either Blew, or Green, or Red. But the Colours of conſiſtent Pigments, not being thoſe which the Preamble of this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has lead you to expect Examples in, I ſhall take the inſtances I am now to give you, rather from Liquors than Dry Bodyes. If then you put a little fair Water into a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:56394:188"/>
cleer and ſlender Vial, (or rather into one of thoſe pipes of Glaſs, which we ſhall by and by mention;) and let fall into it a few drops of a ſtrong Decoction or Infuſion of <hi>Cochineel,</hi> or (for want of that) of <hi>Brazil;</hi> you may ſee the tincted drops deſcend like: little Clouds into the Liquor; through which, if, by ſhaking the Vial, you diffuſe them, they will turn the water either of a Pinck Colour, or like that which is wont to be made by the waſhing of raw fleſh in fair Water; by dropping a little more of the Decoction, you may heighten the Colour into a fine Red, almoſt like that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobles Rubies; by continuing the affuſion, you may bring the Liquor to a kind of a Crimſon, and afterwards to a Dark and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacous Redneſs, ſome what like that of Clotted Blood. And in the paſſage of the Liquor from one of theſe Colours to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you may obſerve, if you conſider it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, divers other leſs noted Colours belonging to Red, to which it is not eaſie to give Names; eſpecially conſidering how much the proportion of the Decoction to the fair Water, and the ſtrength of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, together with that of the trajected Light and other Circumſtances, may vary the Phoenomena of this Experiment. For the convenienter making whereof, we uſe
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:56394:189"/>
nſtead of a Vial, any ſlender Pipe of Glaſs ofabout a foot or more in length, and about the thickneſs of a mans little finger; For, if leaving one end of this Pipe open, you Seal up the other Hermetically, (or at leaſt ſtop it exquiſitely with a Cork well fitted to it, and over-laid with hard Sealing Wax melted, and rubb'd upon it;) you ſhall have a Glaſs, wherein may be obſerv'd the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations of the Colours of Liquors much better than in large Vials, and wherein Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of this Nature may be well made with very ſmall quantities of Liquor. And if you pleaſe, you may in this Pipe produce variety of Colours in the various parts of the Liquor, and keep them ſwimning upon one another unmix'd for a good while. And ſome have marveil'd to ſee, what variety of Colours we have ſometimes (but I confeſs rather by chance than skill) produc'd in thoſe Glaſſes, by the bare infuſion of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil, variouſly diluted with fair Water, and alter'd by the Infuſion of ſeveral Chymical Spirits and other Saline Liquors devoid themſelves of Colour, and when the whole Liquor is reduc'd to an Uniform degree of Colour, I have taken pleaſure to make that very Liquor ſeem to be of Colours gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally differing, by filling with it Glaſſes of a Conical figure, (whether the Glaſs have
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:56394:189"/>
its baſis in the ordinary poſition, or turn'd upwards.) And yet you need not Glaſſes of an extraordinary ſhape to ſee an inſtance of what the vari'd mixture of Light and Shadow can do in the diverſifying of the Colour. For if you take but a large round Vial, with a ſomewhat long and ſlender Neck, and filling it with our Red Infuſion of Brazil, hold it againſt the Light, you will diſcern a notable Diſparity betwixt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of that part of the Liquor which is in the Body of the Vial, and that which is more pervious to the Light in the Neck. Nay, I remember, that I once had a Glaſs and a Blew Liquor (conſiſting chiefly (or only, if my memory deceive me not,) of a certain Solution of Verdigreafe) ſo fitted for my purpoſe, that though in other Glaſſes the Experiment would not ſucceed, yet when that particular Glaſs was fill'd with that Solution, in the Body of the Vial it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd of a Lovely Blew, and in the neck, (where the Light did more dilute the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,) of a manifeſt Green; and though I ſuſpected there might be ſome latent Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs in the ſubſtance of the neck of the Glaſs, which might with the Blew com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Green, yet was I not ſatisfi'd my ſelf with my Conjecture, but the thing ſeem'd odd to me, as well as to divers curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:56394:190"/>
perſons to whom it was ſhown. And I lately had a Broad piece of Glaſs, which being look'd on againſt the Light ſeem'd cleer enough, and held from the Light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd very lightly diſcolour'd, and yet it was a piece knock'd off from a great lump of Glaſs, to which if we rejoyn'd it, where it had been broken off, the whole Maſs was as green as Graſs. And I have ſeveral times uſ'd Bottles and ſtopples that were both made (as thoſe, I had them from aſſur'd me) of the very ſame Metall, and yet whilſt the bottle appear'd but inclining towards a Green, the Stopple (by reaſon of its great thickneſs) was of ſo deep a Colour that you would hardly believe they could poſſibly be made of the ſame materials. But to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſome Ingenious Men, on another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I provided my ſelf of a flat Glaſs (which I yet have by me,) with which if I look againſt the Light with the Broad ſide obverted to the Eye, it appeares like a good ordinary window Glaſs; but if I turn the Edge of it to my Eye, and place my Eye in a convenient poſture in reference to the Light, it may contend for deepneſs of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour with an Emerald. And this Greenneſs puts me in mind of a certain thickiſh, but not conſiſtent Pigment I have ſometimes made, and can ſhow you when you pleaſe,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:56394:190"/>
which being dropp'd on a piece of White Paper appears, where any quantity of it is fallen, of a ſomewhat Crimſon Colour, but being with ones finger ſpread thinly on the Paper does preſently exhibit a fair Green, which ſeems to proceed only from its diſcloſing its Colour upon the Extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Depth into Superficies, if the change be not ſomewhat help'd by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours degenerating upon one or other of the Accounts formerly mention'd. Let me add, that having made divers Tryals with that Blew ſubſtance, which in Painters Shops is call'd <hi>Litmaſe,</hi> we have ſometimes taken Pleaſure to obſerve, that being diſſolv'd in a due proportion of fair Water, the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either oppos'd to the Light, or dropp'd upon White paper, did appear of a deep Colour betwixt Crimſon and Purple; and yet that being ſpread very thin on the Paper and ſuffer'd to dry on there, the Paper was wont to appear Stain'd of a Fine Blew. And to ſatisfie my ſelfe, that the diverſity came not from the Paper, which one might ſuſpect capable of inbibing the Liquor, and altering the Colour, I made the Tryal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a flat piece of purely White Glaſſ'd Earth, (which I ſometimes make uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Experiments of Colours) with an Event not unlike the former.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="334" facs="tcp:56394:191"/>
And now I ſpeak of <hi>Litmaſs,</hi> I will add, that having this very day taken a piece of it, that I had kept by me theſe ſeveral years, to make Tryals about Colours, and having let fall a few drops of the ſtrong Infuſion of it in fair water, into a fine Cryſtal Glaſs, ſhap'd like an inverted Cone, and almoſt full of fair Water, I had now (as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the pleaſure to ſee, and to ſhow others, how theſe few tincted drops variouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing themſelves through the Limpid Water, exhibited divers Colours, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of Purple and Crimſon. And when the Corpuſcles of the Pigment ſeem'd to have equally diffuſ'd themſelves through the whole Liquor, I then by putting two or three drops of Spirit of Salt, firſt made an odd change in the Colour of the Liquor, as well as a viſible commotion among its ſmall parts, and in a ſhort time chang'd it wholly into a very Glorious Yellow, like that of a Topaz. After which if I let fall a few drops of the ſtrong and heavy Solution of Pot-aſhes, whoſe weight would quickly carry it to the ſharp bottome of the Glaſs, there would ſoon appear four very pleaſant and diſtinct Colours; Namely, a Bright, but Dilute Colour at the picked bottome of the Glaſs; a Purple, a little higher; a deep and glorious Crimſon, (which Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:56394:191"/>
ſeem'd to terminate the operation of the Salt upward) in the confines betwixt the Purple and the Yellow; and an Excellent Yellow, the ſame that before enobled the whole Liquor, reaching from thence to the top of the Glaſs. And if I pleas'd to pour very gently a little Spirit of Sal Armoniack, upon the upper part of this Yellow, there would alſo be a Purple or a Crimſon, or both, generated there, ſo that the unalter'd part of the Yellow Liquor appear'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted betwixt the two Neighbouring Colours.</p>
                        <p>My ſcope in this 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Experiment <hi>(Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophilus)</hi> is manifold, as firſt to invite you to be wary in judging of the Colour of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors in ſuch Glaſſes as are therein recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to you, and conſequently as much, if not more, when you imploy other Glaſſes. Secondly, That you may not think it ſtrange, that I often content my ſelf to rub upon a piece of White paper, the Juice of Bodies I would examine, ſince not onely I could not eaſily procure a ſufficient Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the juices of divers of them; but in ſeveral Caſes the Tryals of the quantities of ſuch Juices in Glaſſes would make us more lyable to miſtakes, than the way that in thoſe caſes I have made uſe of. Thirdly, I hope you will by theſe and divers other

Laſtly, I deſign'd to give you an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to free your ſelf from the amazement which poſſeſſes moſt Men, at the Tricks of thoſe Mountebancks that are commonly call'd Water-drinkers. For though not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the vulgar, but ev'n many perſons that are far above that Rank, have ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd to ſee, a man after having drunk a great deal of fair water, to ſpurt it out again in the form of Claret Wine, Sack, and Milk, that they have ſuſpected the intervening of Magick, or ſome forbidden means to effect what they conceived above the power of Art; yet having once by chance had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to oblige a Wanderer that made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of that and other Jugling Tricks, I was eaſily confirm'd by his Ingenious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to me, That this ſo much Admir'd Art, indeed conſiſted rather in a few Tricks, than in any great Skill, in altering the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Colours of things. And I am eaſy
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:56394:192"/>
to be perſwaded, that there may be a great deal of Truth in a little Pamphlet Printed divers years ago in Engliſh, wherein the Author undertakes to diſcover, and that (if I miſtake not) by the confeſſion of ſome of the Complices themſelves, That a famous Water-drinker then much Admir'd in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> perform'd his pretended Tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Liquors by the help of two or three inconſiderable preparations and mixtures of not unobvious Liquors, and chiefly of an Infuſion of Brazil variouſly diluted and made Pale or Yellowiſh, (and otherwiſe alter'd) with Vinegar, the reſt of their work being perform'd by the ſhape of the Glaſſes, by Craft and Legerdemane. And for my part, that which I marvel at in this buſineſs; is, the Drinkers being able to take down ſo much Water, and ſpout it out with that violence; though Cuſtome and a Vomit ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably taken before hand, may in ſome of them much facilitate the work. But as for the changes made in the Liquors, they were but few and ſlight in compariſon of thoſe, that the being converſant in Chymical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, and dextrous in applying them to the Tranſmuting of Colours; may eaſily enough enable a man to make, as ev'n what has been newly deliver'd in this, and the foregoing Experiment; eſpecially if we add

                        <p>You may I preſume <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> have taken notice, that in this whole Treatiſe, I purpoſely decline (as far as I well can) the mentioning of Elaborate Chymical Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, for fear of frighting you by their tediouſneſs and difficulty; but yet in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what I have been newly telling you about the poſſibility of Varying the Colours of Liquors, better than the Water-drinkers are wont to do, I ſhall add, that <hi>Helmont</hi> uſed to make a preparation of Steel, which a very Ingenious Chymiſt, his Sons Friend, whom you know, ſometimes employes for a ſuccedaneum to the Spaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters, by Diluting this <hi>Eſsentia Martis Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quida</hi> (as he calls it) with a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Water. Now that for which I mention to you this preparation, (which as he communicated to me, I know he will not refuſe to <hi>Pyrophilus)</hi> is this, that though the Liquor (as I can ſhew you when you pleaſe) be almoſt of the Colour of a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (not an Oriental) Amethyſt, and conſequently remote enough from Green,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:56394:193"/>
yet a very few drops being let fall into a Large proportion of good Rheniſh, or (in want of that) White Wine (which yet do's not quite ſo well) immediately turn'd the Liquor into a lovely Green, as I have not without delight ſhown ſeveral curious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. By which <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> you, may learn, among other things, how requiſite it is in Experiments about the changes of Colours heedfully to mind the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them; for Water will not, as I have purpoſely try'd, concurr to the production of any ſuch Green, nor did it give that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to moderate Spirit of Wine, wherein I purpoſely diſſolv'd it, and Wine it ſelf is a Liquor that few would ſuſpect of being able to work ſuddenly any ſuch change in a Metalline preparation of this Nature; and to ſatisfie my ſelf that this new Colour proceeds rather from the peculiar Texture of the Wine, than from any greater Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that Rheniſh or White-wine (for that may not abſurdly be ſuſpected) has in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Water; I purpoſely ſharpen'd the Solution of this Eſſence in fair Water, with a good quantity of Spirit of Salt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, the mixture acquir'd no Greenneſs. And to vary the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a little, I try'd, that if into a Glaſs of Rheniſh Wine made Green by this Eſſence,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:56394:194"/>
I dropp'd an Alcalizate Solution, or Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Spirit, the Wine would preſently grow Turbid, and of an odd Dirty Colour: But if inſtead of diſſolving the Eſſence in Wine, I diſſolv'd it in fair Water ſharpen'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with a little Spirit of Salt, then either the Urinious Spirit of Sal Armoniack, or the Solution of the fix'd Salt of Pot-aſhes would immediately turn it of a Yellowiſh Colour, the fix'd or Urinous Salt Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the Vitriolate ſubſtance contain'd in the Eſſence. But here I muſt not forget to take notice of a circumſtance that deſerves to be compar'd with ſome part of the fore-going Experiment, for whereas our Eſſence imparts a Greenneſs to Wine, but not to Water, the Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">Libr. 2<hi rend="sup">•o</hi>.

                        <p>We have often taken notice, as of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable thing, that Metalls as they appear to the Eye, before they come to be farther alter'd by other Bodyes, do exhibit Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours very different from thoſe which the Fire and the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> either apart, or both together, do produce in them; eſpecially conſidering that theſe Metalline Bodyes are after all theſe diſguiſes reducible not only to their former Metalline Conſiſtence and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more radical properties, but to their Colour too, as if Nature had given divers Metalls to each of them a double Colour, an <hi>External,</hi> and an <hi>Internal;</hi> But though upon a more attentive Conſideration of this difference of Colours, it ſeem'd propable to me, that divers (for I ſay not all) of thoſe Colours which we have juſt now call'd <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> are rather produc'd by the Coalition of Metalline Particles with thoſe of the Salts, or other Bodyes employ'd to work on them, than by the bare alteration of the parts of the Metalls themſelves: and though therefore we may call the obvious Colours, Natural or Common, &amp; the others Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious, yet becauſe ſuch changes of Colours, from whatſoever cauſe they be reſolv'd to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:56394:195"/>
proceed may be properly enough taken in to illuſtrate our preſent Subject, we ſhall not ſcruple to take notice of ſome of them, eſpecially becauſe there are among them ſuch as are produc'd without the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Saline <hi>Menſtruums.</hi> Of the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Colours of Metalline Bodies the Chief ſorts ſeem to be theſe three. The firſt, ſuch Colours as are produc'd without other Additaments by the Action of the fire upon Metalls. The next ſuch as emerge from the Coalition of Metalline Particles with thoſe of ſome <hi>Menstruum</hi> imploy'd to Corrode a Metall or Precipitate it; And the laſt, The Colours afforded by Metalline Bodyes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colliquated with, or otherwiſe Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating into, other Bodies, eſpecially fuſible ones. But theſe <hi>(Pyrophilus,)</hi> are only as I told you, the <hi>Chief</hi> ſorts of the adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Colours of Metalls, for there may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers belong to them, of which I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after have occaſion to take notice of ſome, and of which alſo there poſſibly may be others that I never took notice of.</p>
                        <p>And to begin with the firſt ſort of Colours, 'tis well enough known to Chymiſts, that Tin being Calcin'd by fire alone is wont to afford a White <hi>Calx,</hi> and Lead Calcin'd by fire alone affords that moſt Common Red-Powder we call <hi>Minium:</hi> Copper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:56394:195"/>
Calcin'd <hi>per ſe,</hi> by a long or violent fire, is wont to yield (as far as I have had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to take notice of it) a very Dark or Blackiſh Powder; That Iron likewiſe may by the Action of Reverberated flames be turn'd into a Colour almoſt like that of Saffron, may be eaſily deduc'd from the Preparation of that Powder, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its Colour and of the Metall 'tis made of is by Chymiſts call'd, <hi>Crocus Martis per ſe.</hi> And that <hi>Mercury</hi> made by the ſtreſs of Fire, may be turn'd into a Red Powder, which Chymiſts call Precipitate <hi>per ſe,</hi> I elſewhere more particularly declare.</p>

                        <p>The Adventitious Colours produc'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Metalls, or rather with them, by Saline Liquors, are many of them ſo well known to Chymiſts, that I would not here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them, but that beſides a not un-need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Teſtimony, I can add ſomething of my own, to what I ſhall repeat about them, and divers Experiments which are familiar to Chymiſts, are as yet unknown to the greateſt part of Ingenious Men.</p>
                        <p>That Gold diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua Regia</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobles the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> with its own Colour, is a thing that you cannot <hi>(Pyrophilus,)</hi> but have often ſeen. The Solutions of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> are not generally taken notice of, to give any notable Tincture to the <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> but ſometimes when the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:56394:197"/>
Liquor firſt falls upon the Quick Silver, I have obſerv'd a very remarkable, though not durable, Greenneſs, or Blewneſs to be produc'd, which is a <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for you to conſider, though I have not now the leiſure to diſcourſe upon it. Tin Corroded by <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> till the <hi>Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> will work no farther on it, becomes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding White, but as we elſe where note, does very eaſily of it ſelf acquire the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, not of a Metalline <hi>Calx,</hi> but of a Coagulated matter, which we have obſerv'd with pleaſure to look ſo like, either to curdled Milk, or curdled Whites of Eggs, that a perſon unacquainted with ſuch Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may eaſily be miſtaken in it. But when I purpoſely prepar'd a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> that would diſſolve it as <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> diſſolves Silver, and not barely Corrode it, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let it fall again, I remember not that I took notice of any particular Colour in the Solution, as if the more Whitiſh Metalls did not much Tinge their <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> though the conſpicuouſly Colour'd Metalls as Gold, and Copper, do. For Lead diſſolv'd in Spirit of Vinegar or <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> gives a Solution cleer enough, and if the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> be abſtracted appears either Diaphanous or White. Of the Colour of Iron we have elſewhere ſaid ſomething: And 'tis worth
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56394:197"/>
noting, that, though if that Metall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in oyl of Vitriol diluted with water, it affords a Salt or Magiſtery ſo like in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, as well as ſome other Qualities, to other green Vitriol, that Chymiſts do not improperly call it <hi>Vitriolum Martis;</hi> yet I have purpoſely try'd, that, by changing the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and pouring upon the filings of Steel, inſtead of oyl of Vitriol, <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> (whereof as I remember, I us'd 4 parts to one of the Metall) I obtain'd not a Green, but a Saffron Colour Solution; or rather a thick Liquor of a deep but yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh Red. Common Silver, ſuch as is to be met with in Coines, being diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> yields a Solution tincted like that of Copper, which is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, becauſe in the coining of Silver, they are wont (as we elſewhere particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform you) to give it an Allay of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and that which is ſold in ſhops for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined ſilver, is not (ſo far as we have tryed) ſo perfectly free from that ignobler Metall, but that a Solution of It in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> will give a Venereal Tincture to the <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> But we could not obſerve upon the ſolution of ſome Silver, which was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refin'd, (ſuch as ſome that we have, from which 8 or 10 times its weight of Lead has been blown off) that the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum</hi>
                           <pb n="348" facs="tcp:56394:198"/>
though held againſt the Light in a Cryſtal Vial did manifeſtly diſcloſe any Tincture, only it ſeem'd ſometimes not to be quite deſtitute of a little, but very faint Blewiſhneſs.</p>
                        <p>But here I muſt take notice, that of all the Metalls, there is not any which doth ſo eaſily and conſtantly diſcloſe its unobvious colour as Copper doth. For not only in acid <hi>Menſtruums</hi> as <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> and Spirit of Vinegar, it gives a Blewiſh green ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but if it be almoſt any way corroded, it <hi>appears of one of thoſe</hi> two colours, as may be obſerv'd in Verdigreeſe made ſeveral wayes, in that odd preparation of <hi>Venus,</hi> which we elſewhere teach you to make with Sublimate, and in the common Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ols of <hi>Venus</hi> deliver'd by Chymiſts; and ſo conſtant is the diſpoſition of Copper, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the diſguiſe Artiſts put upon it, to diſcloſe the colour we have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning, that we have by forcing it up with <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> obtain'd a Sublimate of a Blewiſh Colour. Nay a famous Spagyriſt affirms, that the very Mercury of it is green, but till he teach us an intelligible way of making ſuch a Mercury, we muſt content our ſelves to inform you, that we have had a Cupreous Body, that was Praecipitated out of a diſtill'd Liquor, that ſeem'd to be
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:56394:198"/>
the Sulphur of <hi>Venus,</hi> and ſeem'd even when flaming, of a Greeniſh Colour. And indeed Copper is a Metall ſo eaſily wrought upon by Liquors of ſeveral kinds; that I ſhould tell you, I know not any Mineral, that will concurr to the production of ſuch a variety of Colours as Copper diſſolv'd in ſeveral <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> as Spirit of Vinegar, <hi>Aqua fortis, Aqua Regis,</hi> Spirit of Nitre, of Urine, of Soot, Oyls of ſeveral kinds, and I know not how many other Liquors, if the variety of ſomewhat differing colours (that Copper will be made to aſſume, as it is wrought upon by ſeveral Liquors) where not comprehended within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of Greeniſh Blew, or Blewiſh Green.</p>
                        <p>And yet I muſt advertiſe you <hi>(Pyrophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus)</hi> that being deſirous to try if I could not make with crude Copper a Green Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without the Blewiſhneſs that is wont to accompany its Vulgar Solutions, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought my ſelf of uſing two <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> which I had not known imploy'd to work on this Metall, and which I had certain Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to make Tryal of, as I ſucceſsfully did. The one of theſe Liquors (if I much miſremember not) was Spirit of Sugar diſtill'd in a Retort, which muſt be warily done, (if you will avoid breaking your
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:56394:199"/>
glaſſes) and the other, Oyl or Spirit of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, which affords a fine Green Solution that is uſeful to me on ſeveral occaſions. And yet to ſhew that the adventitious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour may reſult, as well from the true and permanent Copper it ſelf, as the Salts wherewith 'tis corroded, I ſhall add, that if you take a piece of good <hi>Dantzick</hi> Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris, or any other Vitriol wherein <hi>Venus</hi> is praedominant, and having moiſtened it in your Mouth, or with fair water, rubb it upon a whetted knife, or any other bright piece of Steel or Iron, it will (as we have formerly told you) preſently ſtain the Steel with a Reddiſh colour, like that of Copper; the reaſon of which, we muſt not now ſtay to inquire.</p>

ſometimes a Red ſolution of both which I can ſhow you. But though I have from Minerals obtain'd with ſeveral <hi>Menſtruums</hi> very differing Colours, and ſome ſuch as perhaps you would be ſurpriz'd to ſee drawn from ſuch Bodies: yet I muſt now paſs by the particulars, being deſirous to put an End to this Treatiſe, before I put an end to your Patience and my own.</p>

                           <p>And yet before I paſs to the next Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, I muſt put you in mind, that the Colours of Metals may in many caſes be further alter'd by imploying, either praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating Salts, or other convenient Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to act upon their Solutions. Of this you may remember, that I have given you ſeveral Inſtances already, to which may be added ſuch as theſe, That if Quickſilver be diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and Praecipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Solution, either with water impregnated with Sea ſalt, or with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that Concrete, it falls to the Bottom in the form of a white powder, whereas if it be Praecipitated with an Alcaly, it will afford a Yellowiſh or tawny powder, and if there be no Praecipitation made; and the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> be drawn off with a convenient
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:56394:201"/>
fire, the corroded Mercury will remain in the Bottom, in the form of a ſubſtance that may be made to appear of differing Colours by differing degrees of Heat; As I remember that lately having purpoſely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> from ſome Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that we had diſſolv'd in it, ſo that there remain'd a white <hi>Calx,</hi> expoſing that to ſeveral degrees of Fire, and afterwards to a naked one, we obtain'd ſome new Colours, and at length the greateſt part of the <hi>Calx</hi> lying at the Bottome of the Vial, and being brought partly to a Deep Yellow, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a Red Colour, the reſt appear'd ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to the upper part and neck of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, ſome in the form of a Reddiſh, and ſome of an Aſh-Colour Sublimate. But of the differing Colours which by differing wayes and working of Quick Silver with Fire, and Saline Bodies, may be produc'd in Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, I may elſewhere have occaſion to take further notice. I alſo told you not long ſince, that if you corrode Quick-ſilver with Oyl of Vitriol inſtead of <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and abſtract the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a White <hi>Calx</hi> which by the Affuſion of Fair Water preſently turns into a Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Colour.

                        <p>The third chief ſort of the Adventitious Colours of Metals, is, that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by aſſociating them (eſpecially when Calcin'd) with other fuſible Bodies, and Principally Venice, and other fine Glaſs devoid of Colour.</p>
                        <p>I have formerly given you an Example, whereby it may appear, that a Metal may impart to Glaſs a Colour much differing from its own, when I told you, how with Silver, I had given Glaſs a lovely Golden Colour. And I ſhall now add, that I have Learn'd from one of the Chief Artificers that ſells Painted Glaſs, that thoſe of his Trade Colour it Yellow with a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Calx</hi> of Silver. Though having lately had occaſion among other Tryals to mingle a few grains of Shell-ſilver (ſuch as is imploy'd with the Penſil and Pen) with a convenient proportion of povvder'd Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Glaſs, having kept them tvvo or three
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:56394:202"/>
hours in fuſion, I was ſurpriz'd to find the Colliquated Maſs to appear upon breaking the Crucible of a lovely Saphirine Blew, which made me ſuſpect my Servant might have brought me a wrong Crucible, but he conſtantly affirm'd it to be the ſame where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Silver was put, and conſiderable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances countenanc'd his Aſſertion, ſo that till I have opportunity to make farther Tryal, I cannot but ſuſpect, either that Silver which is not (which is not very probable) brought to a perfect Fuſion and Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Glaſs, may impart to it other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours than when Neal'd upon it, or elſe (which is leſs unlikely) that though Silver Beaters uſually chuſe the fineſt Coyn they can get, as that which is moſt extenſive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Hammer, yet the Silver-leaves of which this Shel-ſilver was made, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo much Copper as to enable it to give the predominant Tincture to the Glaſs.</p>
                        <p>For, I muſt proceed to tell you <hi>(Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus)</hi> as another inſtance of the Adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Colours of Metals, that which is ſomething ſtrange, Namely, That though Copper Calcin'd <hi>per ſe</hi> affords but a Dark and baſely Colour'd <hi>Calx,</hi> yet the Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do with it, as themſelves inform me, Tinge their Glaſs green. And I remember, that when once we took ſome crude Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:56394:202"/>
and by frequent Igintion quenching it in Water had reduc'd it to a Dark and Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd Powder, and afterwards kept it in Fuſion in about a 100. times its weight of fine Glaſs, we had, though not a Green, yet a Blew colour'd Maſs, which would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been Green, if we had hit right upon the Proportion of the Materials, and the Degree of Fire, and the Time wherein it ought to be kept in Fuſion, ſo plentifully does that Metal abound in a Venerial Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, as Artiſts call it, and in ſo many wayes does it diſcloſe that Richneſs. But though Copper do as we have ſaid give ſomewhat near the like Colour to Glaſs, which it does to <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> yet it ſeems worth inquiry, whether thoſe new Colours which Mineral Bodies diſcloſe in melted Glaſs, proceed from the Coalition of the Corpuſcles of the Mineral with the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Glaſs as ſuch, or from the Action (excited or actuated by fire) of the Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizate Salt (which is a main Ingredient of Glaſs,) upon the Mineral Body, or from the concurrence of both theſe Cauſes, or elſe from any other. But to return to that which we were ſaying, we may obſerve that <hi>Putty</hi> made by calcining together a proportion of Tin and Lead, as it is it ſelf a White <hi>Calx,</hi> ſo does it turn the <hi>Pitta di Cryſtalio</hi> (as the

Glaſsmen call the matter of the Purer ſort of Glaſs, wherewith it is Colliquated into a White Maſs, which if it be opacous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough is employ'd, as we elſewhere declare, for White Amel. But of the Colours which the other Metals may be made 'to produce in Colourleſs Glaſs, and other Vitrifiable Bodies, that have native Colours of their own, I muſt leave you to inform you ſelf upon Tryal, or at leaſt muſt forbear to do it till another time, conſidering how many Annotations are to follow, upon what has in this and the two former Experiments been ſaid already.</p>

                           <p>'Tis not only Metalline, but other Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies, that may be imploy'd, to give Tinctures unto Glaſs (and 'tis worth noting
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:56394:204"/>
how ſmall a quantity of ſome Mineral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, will Tinge a Comparatively vaſt proportion of Glaſs, and we have ſometimes attempted to Colour Glaſs, ev'n with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Stones, and had cauſe to think the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment not caſt away. And 'tis known by them that have look'd into the Art of Glaſs; that the Artificers uſe to tinge their Glaſs Blew, with that Dark Mineral <hi>Zaffora,</hi> (ſome of my Tryals on which I elſewhere acquaint you) which ſome would have to be a Mineral Earth, others a Stone, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neither the one, nor the other, but which is confeſſedly of a Dark, but not a Blew Colour, though it be not agreed of what particular Colour it is. 'Tis likewiſe though a familiar yet a remarkable practiſe among thoſe that Deal in the making of Glaſs, to imploy (as ſome of themſelves have inform'd me) what they call Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganeſs, and ſome Authors call <hi>Magneſia</hi> (of which I make particular mention in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treatiſe) to exhibit in Glaſs not only other Colours than its own, (which is ſo like in Darkneſs or Blackiſhneſs to the Load-ſtone, that 'tis given by Mineraliſts, for one of the Reaſons of its Latine Name) but Colours differing from one another. For though they uſe it, (which is ſomewhat ſtrange) to Clarifye their Glaſs, and free
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:56394:204"/>
it from that Blewiſh Greeniſh Colour, which elſe it would too often be ſubject to, yet they alſo imploy it in certain proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to tinge their Glaſs both with a Red colour, and with a Purpliſh or Murry, and putting in a greater Quantity, they alſo make with it that deep obſcure Glaſs which is wont to paſs for Black, which agrees very well with, and may ſerve to confirm what we noted near the beginning of the 44th Experiment, of the ſeeming Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe Bodies that are overcharg'd with the Corpuſcles of ſuch Colours, as Red, or Blevv, or Green, &amp;c. And as by ſeveral Metals and other Minerals vve can give various Colours to Glaſs, ſo on the other ſide, by the differing Colours that Mineral Oars, or other Mineral Povvders being melted vvith. Glaſs diſcloſe in it, a good Conjecture may be oftentimes made of the Metall or knovvn Mineral, that the Oar propos'd, either holds, or is moſt of kin to. And this eaſie vvay of examining Oars, may be in ſome caſes of good uſe, and is not ill deliver'd by <hi>Glauber,</hi> to vvhom I ſhall at preſent refer you, for a more particular account of it: unleſs your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity command alſo vvhat I have obſerv'd about theſe matters; only I muſt here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe you, that great circumſpection is

requiſite to keep this way from proving fallacious, upon the account of the variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Colour that may be produc'd by the differing proportions that may be us'd betwixt the Oar and the Glaſs, by the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Poorneſs of the Oar it ſelf, by the Degree of Fire, and (eſpecially) by the Length of Time, during which the matter is kept in fuſion; as you will eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from what you will quickly meet with in the following Annotation upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent 48th Experiment.</p>

                           <p>There is another way and differing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from thoſe already mention'd, by which Metalls may be brought to exhibit adventitious Colours: For by This, the Metall do's not ſo much impart a Colour to another Body, as receive a Colour from it, or rather both Bodies do by the new Texture reſulting from their miſtion produce a new Colour. I will not inſiſt to this purpoſe upon the Examples afforded us by yellow Orpiment, and common Sea Salt, from which, ſublim'd together, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts unanimouſly affirm their White or Cryſtalline Arſenick to be made: But 'tis not unworthy our nothing, That though Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

Orpiment be acknowledg'd to be the Copiouſeſt by far of the two Ingredients of Arſenick, yet this laſt nam'd Body being duely added to the higheſt Colour'd Metall Copper, when 'tis in fuſion, gives it a white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both within and without. Thus <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> changes and improves the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Copper by turning it into Braſs. And I have ſometimes by the help of Zincle duely mix'd after a certain manner, given Copper one of the Richeſt Golden Colours that ever I have ſeen the Beſt true Gold En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled with. But pray have a care that ſuch Hints fall not into any hands that may miſ-imploy them.</p>

                           <p>Upon the Knowledge of the differing wayes of making Minerals and Metalls produce their adventitious Colours in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies capable of Vitrification, depends the pretty Art of making what Chymiſts by a Barbarous Word are pleas'd to call <hi>Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> that is counterfeit, or factitious Gemms, as Emeralds, Rubies, Saphires, Topazes, and the like. For in the making of theſe, though pure Sand or Calcin'd Cryſtal give the Body, yet 'tis for the moſt part ſome Metalline or Mineral <hi>Calx,</hi> mingled in a
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:56394:206"/>
ſmal proportion that gives the Colour. But though I have many years ſince taken delight, to divert my ſelf with this pleaſing Art, and have ſeen very pretty Productions of it, yet beſides that I fear I have now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got moſt of the little Skill I had in it, this is no place to entertain you with what would rather take up an intire Diſcourſe, than be comprehended in an Annotation; wherefore the few things which I ſhall here take notice of to you, are only what belong to the preſent Argument, Namely,</p>
                           <p>Firſt, That I have often obſerv'd that Calcin'd Lead Colliquated with fine White Sand or Cryſtal, reduc'd by ignitions and ſubſequent extinctions in Water to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Powder, will of it ſelf be brought by a due Decoction to give a cleer Maſs Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd like a <hi>German</hi> Amethyſt. For though this glaſs of Lead, is look'd upon by them that know no better way of making <hi>Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> as the grand Work of them all, yet which is an inconvenience that much ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes this way, the Calcin'd Lead it ſelf does not only afford matter to the <hi>Amanſes,</hi> but has alſo as well as other Metals a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of its own, which as I was ſaying, I have often found to be like that of <hi>German</hi> (as many call them) not Eaſtern Amethyſts.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, That nevertheleſs this Colour
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:56394:206"/>
may be eaſily over-powr'd by thoſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Mineral Pigments (if I may ſo call them) ſo that with a glaſs of Lead, you may Emulate (for Inſtance) the freſh and lovely Greenneſs of an Emerald, though in divers caſes the Colour which the Lead it ſelf upon Vitrification tends to, may vitiate that of the Pigment, which you would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce into the Maſs.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, That ſo much ev'n theſe Colours depend upon Texture, that in the Glaſs of Lead it ſelf made of about three parts of <hi>Lytharge</hi> or <hi>Minium</hi> Colliquated with one of very finely Powder'd Cryſtal or Sand, we have taken pleaſure to make the mixture paſs through differing Colours, as we kept it more or leſs in the Fuſion. For it was not uſually till after a pretty long Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Maſs attain'd to the Amethyſtin Colour.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly and laſtly, That the degrees of Coction and other Circumſtances may ſo vary the Colour produc'd in the ſame maſs, that in a Crucible that was not great I have had fragments of the ſame Maſs, in ſome of which perhaps not ſo big as a Hazel-Nut, you may diſcern four diſtinct Colours.</p>

                           <p>You may remember <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> that when I mention'd the three ſorts of adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Colours of Metals, I mention'd them but as the chief, not the only. For there may be other wayes, which though they do not in ſo ſtrict a ſenſe belong to the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Colours of Metals, may not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be reduc'd to them. And of theſe I ſhall name now a couple, without denying that there may be more.</p>
                           <p>The firſt may be drawn from the practiſe of thoſe that Dye Scarlet. For the famouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Maſter in that Art, either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> has confeſſ'd to me, that neither o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor he can ſtrike that lovely Colour which is now wont to be call'd the <hi>Bow-Dye,</hi> without their Materials be Boyl'd in Veſſels, either made of, or lin'd with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Metall. But of what I have known attempted in this kind, I muſt not as yet for fear of prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <note place="margin">See the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the fiftieth Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> or diſpleaſing others give you any particular Account.</p>
                           <p>The other way <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> of making Metals afford unobvious Colours, is by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buing divers Bodies with Solutions of them made in their proper <hi>Menſtruum's,</hi> As (for
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:56394:207"/>
Inſtance) though Copper plentifully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> will imbue ſeveral Bodies with the Colour of the Solution; Yet ſome other Metalls will not (as I elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where tell you) and have often try'd. Gold diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> will, (which is not commonly known) Dye the Nails and Skin, and Hafts of Knives, and other things made of Ivory, not with a Golden, but a Purple Colour, which thought it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it ſelf but ſlowly, is very durable, and ſcarce ever to be waſh'd out. And if I miſremember not, I have already told you in this Treatiſe, that the purer Cryſtals of fine Silver made with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> though they appear White, will preſently Dye the Skin and Nails, with a Black, or at leaſt a very Dark Colour, which Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not waſh off, as it will ordinary Ink from the ſame parts. And divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bodies may the ſame way be Dy'd, ſome of a Black, and others of a Blackiſh Colour.</p>
                           <p>And as Metalline, ſo likewiſe Mineral Solutions may produce Colours differing enough from thoſe of the Liquors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I ſhall not fetch an Example of this, from what we daily ſee happen in the powdring of Beef, which by the Brine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about it (eſpecially if the fleſh be
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:56394:208"/>
over ſalted) do's oftentimes appear at our Tables of a Green, and ſometimes of a Reddiſh Colour, (deep enough) nor ſhall I inſiſt on the practiſe of ſome that deal in Salt Petre, who, (as I ſuſpected, and as themſelves acknowledg'd to me) do, with the mixture of a certain proportion of that, and common Salt, give a fine Redneſs, not only to Neats Tongues, but which is more pretty as well as difficult, to ſuch fleſh, as would otherwiſe be purely White; Theſe Examples, I ſay, I ſhall deeline inſiſting on, as chuſing rather to tell you, that I have ſeveral times try'd, that a Solution of the Sulphur of Vitriol, or ev'n of common Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, though the Liquor appear'd clear enough, would immediately tinge a piece of new Coin, or other clean Silver, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a Golden, ſometimes with a deeper, and more Reddiſh colour, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtrength of the Solution, and the quantity of it, that chanc'd to adhere to the Metall, which may take off your wonder that the water of the hot Spring at <hi>Bath,</hi> abounding with diſſolv'd Subſtances of a very Sulphureous Nature, ſhould for a while, as it were gild, the new or clean pieces of Silver coyn, that are for a due time immers'd in it. And to theſe may be added thoſe formerly mention'd Examples
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:56394:208"/>
of the adventitious Colours of Mineral Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; which brings into my mind, that, ev'n Vegetable Liquors, whether by dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or by altering the Texture of the Body that imbibes them, may ſtain other Bodies with Colours differing enough from their own, of which very good Herbariſts have afforded us a notable Example, by affirming that the Juice of <hi>Alcanna</hi> being green (in which ſtate I could never here procure it) do's yet Dye the Skin and Nails of a Laſting Red. But I ſee this Treatiſe is like to prove too bulky without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of further Inſtances of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                        <p>Meeting the other day, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> in an <hi>Italian</hi> book, that treats of other matters, with a way of preparing what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor calls a <hi>Lacca</hi> of Vegetables, by which the <hi>Italians</hi> mean a kind of Extract fit for Painting, like that rich <hi>Lacca</hi> in Engliſh commonly call'd <hi>Lake,</hi> which is imploy'd by Painters as a glorious Red. And finding the Experiment not to be inconſiderable, and very defectively ſet down, it will not be amiſs to acquaint you with what ſome Tryals have inform'd us, in reference to this
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:56394:209"/>
Experiment, which both by our Italian Author, and by divers of his Countrymen, is look'd upon as no trifling Secret.</p>
                        <p>Take then the root call'd in Latin <hi>Curcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and in Engliſh Turmerick, (which I made uſe of, becauſe it was then at hand, and is among Vegetables fit for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one of the moſt eaſieſt to be had) and when it is beaten, put what Quantity of it you pleaſe into fair Water, adding to every pound of Water about a ſpoonfull or better of as ſtrong a <hi>Lixivium</hi> or Solution of Pot-aſhes as you can well make, clarifying it by Filtration before you put it to the Decoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water. Let theſe things boyl, or rather ſimper over a ſoft Fire in a clean glaz'd Earthen Veſſel, till you find by the Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſheet of White Paper (or by ſome other way of Tryal) that the Liquor is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently impregnated with the Golden Tincture of the Turmerick, then take the Decoction off the Fire, and Filter or Strain it that it may be clean, and leiſurely drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into it a ſtrong Solution of Roch Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, you ſhall find the Decoction as it were curdl'd, and the tincted part of it either to emerge, to ſubſide, or to ſwim up and down, like little Yellow flakes; and if you pour this mixture into a Tunnel lin'd with Cap Paper, the Liquor that Filtred former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:56394:209"/>
ſo Yellow, will now paſs clean thorow the Filtre, leaving its tincted, and as it were curdled parts in the Filtre, upon which fair Water muſt be ſo often pour'd, till you have Dulcifi'd the matter therein contain'd, the ſign of which Dulcification is (you know) when the Water that has paſs'd through it, comes from it as taſtleſs as it was pour'd on it. And if without Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration you would gather together the flakes of this Vegetable Lake, you muſt pour a great Quantity of fair Water upon the Decoction after the affuſion of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous Solution, and you ſhall find the Liquor to grow clearer, and the Lake to ſettle together at the bottom, or emerge to the top of the Water, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times having not pour'd out a ſufficient Quantity of fair Water, we have obſerv'd the Lake partly to ſubſide, and partly to emerge, leaving all the middle of the Liquor clear. But to make this Lake fit for uſe, it muſt by repeated affuſions of freſh Water, be Dulcifi'd from the adhering Salts, as well as that ſeparated by Filtration, and be ſpread and ſuffer'd to dry lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely upon pieces of Cloth, with Brown Paper, or Chalk, or Bricks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                           <p>Whereas it is preſum'd that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Vegetables obtain'd this way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts but of the more. Soluble and Colour'd parts of the Plants that afford it, I muſt take the liberty to Queſtion the Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And for my ſo doing, I ſhall give you this account.</p>
                           <p>According to the Notions (ſuch as they were) that I had concerning Salts; Allom, though to ſenſe a Homogeneous Body, ought not to be reckon'd among true Salts, but to be it ſelf look'd upon as a kind of Magiſtery, in regard that as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Vitriol (for ſuch I have had) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains both a Saline ſubſtance and a Metall, whether Copper, or Iron, corroded by it, and aſſociated with it; ſo Allom which may be of ſo near a kin to Vitriol, that in ſome places of <hi>England</hi> (as we are aſſur'd by good Authority the ſame ſtone will
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:56394:210"/>
ſometimes afford both) ſeems manifeſtly to contain a peculiar kind of Acid Spirit, generated in the Bowels of the Earth, and ſome kind of ſtony matter diſſolv'd by it. And though in making our ordinary Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, the Workmen uſe the Aſhes of a Sea Weed (vulgarly call'd Kelp) and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine: yet thoſe that ſhould know, inform us, that, here in <hi>England,</hi> there is beſides the factitious Allom, Allom made by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without the help of thoſe Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd this compoſition of Allom, and that Alcalizate Salts are wont to Praecipitate what acid Salts have diſſolv'd, I could not but be prone to ſuſpect that the Curdled Matter, which is call'd the Magiſtery of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, may have in it no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proportion of a ſtony ſubſtance Praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated out of the Allom by the <hi>Lixivium,</hi> wherein the Vegetable had been decoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to ſhew you, that there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that all the curdl'd ſubſtance muſt belong to the Vegetable, I ſhall add, that I took a ſtrong Solution of Allom, and having Filtred it, by pouring in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Quantity of a ſtrong Solution of Pot-aſhes, I preſently, as I expected, turn'd the mixture into a kind of white Curds; which being put to Filtre, the Paper retain'd a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:56394:211"/>
                              <hi>Calx,</hi> copious enough, very White, and which ſeem'd to be of a Mineral Nature, both by ſome other ſignes, and this, that little Bits of it being put upon a live Coal, which was Gently Blown whilſt they were on it, they did neither melt nor fly away, and yon n ay keep a Quantity of this White ſubſtance for a good while, (nay for ought I can gueſs for a very long one) in a red hot Crucible without loſing or ſpoiling it; nor did not Water wherein I purpoſely kept another parcel of ſuch <hi>Calx,</hi> ſeem to do any more than waſh away the looſer adhering Salts from the ſtony Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which therefore ſeem'd unlikely to be ſeparable by abiutions (though reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) from the Praecipitated parts of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, whoſe Lake is intended. And to ſhew you, that there is likewiſe in Allom a Body, with which the fix'd Salt of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calizare Solution will concoaguiare into a Saline Subſtance differing from either of them, I ſhall add, that I have taken plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to recover out of the ſlowly exhal'd Liquor, that paſs'd through the filtre, and left the foremention'd <hi>Calx</hi> behind, a Body that at leaſt ſeem'd a Salt very pretty to look on, as being very White, and conſiſting of an innumerable company of exceeding ſlender, and ſhining Particles, which
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:56394:211"/>
would in part eaſily melt at the flame of a Candle, and in part flye away with ſome little noiſe. But of this ſubſtance, and its odd Qualities more perhaps elſewhere; for now I ſhall only take notice to you, that I have likewiſe with Urinous Salts, ſuch as the Spirit of Sal Armoniack, as well as with the Spirit of Urine it ſelf, Nay, (if I much miſtake not) ev'n with Stale Urine undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil'd, eaſily Precipitated ſuch a White <hi>Calx,</hi> as I was formerly ſpeaking of, out of a Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Solution of Allom, ſo that there is need of Circumſpect on in judging of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Liquors by Precipitations wherein Allom intervenes, elſe we may ſometimes miſtakingly imagine that to be Precipitated out of a Liquor by Allom, which is rather Precipitated out of Allom by the Liquor: And this puts me in mind to tell you, that 'tis not unpleaſant to behold how quickly the Solution of Allom (or injected lumps of Allom) do's occaſion the ſevering of the colour'd parts of the Decoction from the Liquor that ſeem'd to have ſo perfectly imbib'd them.</p>

                           <p>The above mention'd way of making Lakes we have tryed not only with Turme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, but alſo with Madder, which yielded us a Red Lake; and with Rue, which affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us an extract, of (almoſt if not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) the ſame Colour with that of the leaves.</p>
                           <p>But in regard that 'tis Principally the Alcalizate Salt of the Pot-aſhes, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables the water to Extract ſo powerfully the Tincture of the Decocted Vegetables, I fear that our Author may be miſtaken by ſuppoſing that the Decoction will alwayes be of the very ſame Colour with the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable it is made off. For Lixiviate Salts, to which Pot-aſhes eminently belong, though by peircing and opening the Bodies of Vegetables, they prepare and diſpoſe them to part readily with their Tincture, yet ſome Tinctures they do not only draw out, but likewiſe alter them, as may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily made appear by many of the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments already ſet down in this Treatiſe, and though Allom being of an Acid Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, its Solutions may in ſome Caſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Adventitious Colours produc'd by the Alcaly, and reſtore the former: yet
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:56394:212"/>
beſides that Allom is not, as I have lately ſhown, a meer Acid Salt, but a mixt Body, and beſides, that its operations are languid in compariſon of the activity of Salts freed by Diſtillation, or by Incineration and Diſſolution, from the moſt of their Earthy parts, we have ſeen already Examples, that in divers Caſes an Acid Salt will not reſtore a Vegetable ſubſtance to the Colour of which an Alcalizate one had depriv'd it, but makes it aſſume a third very differing from both, as we formerly told you, that if Syrrup of Violets were by an Alcaly turn'd Green, (which Colour, as I have try'd, may be the ſame way produc'd in the Violet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves themſelves without any Relation to a Syrrup) an Acid Salt would not make it Blew again, but Red. And though I have by this way of making Lakes, made Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries (for ſuch they ſeem to be) of Brazil, and as I remember of Cochinele it ſelf, and of other things, Red, Yellow or Green which Lakes were enobled with a Rich Colour, and others had no bad one; yet in ſome the colour of the Lake ſeem'd rather inferiour than otherwiſe to that of the Plant, and in others it ſeem'd both very differing, and much worſe; but Writing this in a time and place where I cannot provide my ſelf of Flowres and other Vegetables to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:56394:213"/>
ſuch Tryals in a competent variety of Subjects, I am content not to be poſitive in delivering a judgment of this way of Lakes, till Experience, or You, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> ſhall have afforded me a fuller and more particular Information.</p>

                        <head>EXPERIMENT L.</head>
                        <p>Yet here, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I muſt take leave to inſert an Experiment, though perhaps you'l think its coming in here an Intruſion, For I confeſs its more proper place would have been among thoſe Experiments, that were brought as proofs and applications of our Notions concerning the differences of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:56394:214"/>
Salts; but not having remembred to inſert it in its fitteſt place, I had rather take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it in this, than leave it quite unmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd: partly becauſe it doth ſomewhat differ from the reſt of our Experiments about Colours, in the way whereby 'tis made; and partly becauſe the grounds upon which I devis'd it, may hint to you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Method I uſe in Deſigning and Varying Experiments about Colours, and upon this account I ſhall inform you, not only What I did, but Why I did it.</p>
                        <p>I conſider'd then that the work of the former Experiments was either to change the Colour of a Body into another, or quite to deſtroy it, without giving it a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, but I had a mind to give you alſo a way, whereby to turn a Body endued with one Colour into two Bodies, of Colours, as well as conſiſtencies, very diſtinct from each other, and that by the help of a Body that had it ſelf no Colour at all. In order to this, I remembered, that finding the Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Spirit of Vinegar to be wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory'd by its working upon <hi>Minium</hi> (or calcin'd Lead) whereby the Salin parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> have their Taſte and Nature quite alter'd, I had, among other Conjectures I had built upon that change, rightly concluded, that the Solution of Lead
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:56394:214"/>
in Spirit of Vinegar would alter the Colour of the Juices and Infuſions of ſeveral Plants, much after the like manner that I had found Oyl of Tartar to do; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I was quickly ſatisfied upon Tryal, that the Infuſion of Roſe-leaves would by a ſmall quantity of this Solution well mingl'd with it, be immediately turn'd into a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſad Green.</p>
                        <p>And further, I had often found, that Oyl of Vitriol, though a potently Acid <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> will yet Praecipitate many Bodies, both Mineral and others, diſſolv'd not onely in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> (as ſome Chymiſts have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd) but particularly in Spirit of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and I have further found, that the <hi>Calces</hi> or Powders Praecipitated by this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor were uſually fair and White.</p>
                        <p>Laying theſe things together, 'twas not difficult to conclude, that if upon a good Tincture of Red Roſe-leaves made with fair Water, I dropp'd a pretty quantity of a ſtrong and ſweet Solution of <hi>Minium,</hi> the Liquor would be turn'd into the like muddy Green Subſtance, as I have formerly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to You, that Oyl of Tartar would reduce it to, and that if then I added a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient quantity of good Oyl of Vitriol, this laſt nam'd Liquor would have two diſtinct operations upon the Mixture, the one, that
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:56394:215"/>
it would Praecipitate that reſolv'd Lead in the form of a White Powder; the other, that it would Clarifie the muddy Mixture, and both reſtore, and exceedingly heighten the Redneſs of the Infuſion of Roſes, which vvas the moſt copious Ingredient of the Green compoſition, and accordingly trying the Experiment in a Wine glaſs ſharp at the bottom (like an inverted Cone) that the ſubſiding Powder might ſeem to take up the more room, and be the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, I found that when I had ſhaken the Green Mixture, that the colour'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor might be the more equally diſperſed, a few drops of the rectifi'd Oyl of Vitriol did preſently turn the opacous Liquor into one that was cleer and Red, almoſt like a Rubie, and threw down good ſtore of a Powder, which when 'twas ſettl'd, would have appear'd very White, if ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd Particles of the red Liquor had not a little Allay'd the Purity, though not ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd the Beauty of the Colour. And to ſhew you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that theſe Effects do not flow from the Oyl of Vitriol, as it is ſuch, but as it is a ſtrongly Acid <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that has the property both to Praecipitate Lead, as well as ſome other Concretes out of Spirit of Vinegar, and to heighten the Colour of Red Roſe-leaves, I add, that I
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:56394:215"/>
have done the ſame thing, though perhaps not quite ſo well with Spirit of Salt, and that I could not do it with <hi>Aqua-ſortis,</hi> becauſe though that potent <hi>Menſtruum</hi> does as well as the others heighthen the Redneſs of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet it would not like them Precipitate Lead out of Spirit of Vinegar, but would rather have diſſolv'd it, if it had not found it diſſolv'd already.</p>
                        <p>And as by this way we have produc'd a Red Liquor, and a White Precipitate out of a Dirty Green magiſtery of Roſe-leaves, ſo by the ſame Method, you may produce a fair Yellow, and ſometimes a Red Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and the like Precipitate, out of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of a curious Purple Colour. For you may call to mind, that in the Annotation upon the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Experiment I intimated to you, that I had with a few drops of an Alcaly turn'd the Infuſion of Logg-wood into a lovely Purple. Now if inſtead of this Alcaly I ſubſtituted a very ſtrong and well Filtrated Solution of <hi>Minium,</hi> made with Spirit of Vinegar, and put about half as much of this Liquor as there was of the Infuſion of Logg-wood, (that the mixture might afford a pretty deal of Precipitate,) the affuſion of a conventent proportion of Spirit of Salt, would (if the Liquors were well and nimbly ſtirr'd together) preſently
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:56394:216"/>
ſtrike down a Precipitate like that formerly mention'd, and turn the Liquor that ſwam above it, for the moſt part into a lovely Yellow.</p>
                        <p>But for the advancing of this Experiment a little further, I conſider'd, that in caſe I firſt turn'd a ſpoonfull of the infuſion of Logg-wood Purple, by a convenient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Solution of <hi>Minium,</hi> the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Spirit of Sal Armoniack, would Precipitate the Corpuſcles of Lead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd in the Solution of <hi>Minium,</hi> and yet not deſtory the Purple colour of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; whereupon I thus proceeded; I took about a ſpoonfull of the <hi>freſh</hi> Tincture of Logg-wood, (for I found that if it were <hi>ſtale</hi> the Experiment would not alwayes ſucceed,) and having put to it a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proportion of the Solution of <hi>Minium</hi> to turn it into a deep and almoſt opacous Purple, I then drop'd in as much Spirit of Sal Armoniack, as I gueſs'd would Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate about half or more (but not all) of the Lead, and immediately ſtirring the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture well together, I mingled the Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated parts with the others, ſo that they fell to the bottom, partly in the form of a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and partly in the form of a Curdled Subſtance, that (by reaſon of the Predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy of the Ting'd Corpuſcles over
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:56394:216"/>
the White) retain'd as well as the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natant Liquor, a Blewiſh Purple colour ſufficiently Deep, and then inſtantly (but yet Warily,) pouring on a pretty Quantity of Spirit of Salt, the matter firſt Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was, by the above ſpecifi'd figure of the bottome of the Glaſs preſerv'd from being reach'd by the Spirituous Salt; which haſtily Precipitated upon it a new Bed (if I may ſo call it) of White Powder, being the remaining Corpuſcles of the Lead, that the Urinous Spirit had not ſtruck down: So that there appear'd in the Glaſs three diſtinct and very differingly colour'd Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; a Purple or Violet-colour'd Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate at the bottom, a White and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (ſometimes a Variouſly colour'd) Precipitate over That, and at the Top of all a Tranſparent Liquor of a lovely Yellow, or Red.</p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that though to ſome I may have ſeem'd to have lighted on this (50<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) Experiment by chance, and though others may imagine, that to have excogitated it, muſt have proceeded from ſome extraordinary inſight into the nature of Colours, yet indeed, the deviſing of it need not be look'd upon as any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, eſpecially to one that is a little verſ'd in the notions, I have in theſe, and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:56394:217"/>
hinted concerning the differences of Salts. And perhaps I might add upon more than conjecture, that theſe very notions and ſome particulars ſcatteringly deliver'd in this Treatiſe, being skilfully put together, may ſuggeſt divers matters (at leaſt) about Colours, that will not be altogether Deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. But thoſe hinted, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I muſt now leave ſuch as You to proſecute, having already ſpent farr more time than I intended to allow my ſelf in acquainting You with particular Experiments and Obſervations concerning the changes of Colour, to which I might have added many more, but that I hope I may have preſented You with a competent number to make out in ſome meaſure what I have at the beginning of this Eſſay either propos'd as my Deſign in this Tract, or deliver'd as my Conjectures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe matters. And it not being my preſent Deſigne, as I have more than once Declar'd, to deliver any Poſitive Hypotheſis or ſolemn Theory of Colours, but only to furniſh You with ſome Experiments to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the framing of ſuch a Theory; I ſhall add nothing to what I have ſaid already, but a requeſt that you would not be forward to think I have been miſtaken in any thing I have deliver'd as matter of Fact concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the changes of Colours, in caſe you
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:56394:217"/>

Of which truth I ſhall only give you that ſingle and almoſt obvious, but yet illuſtrious inſtance of the Art of Dying Scarlets, for though you ſhould ſee every Ingredient that is us'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, though I ſhould particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form You of the weight of each, and though you ſhould be preſent at the kindling of the fire, and at the increaſing and remitting of it, when ever the degree of Heat is to be alter'd, and though (in a word) you ſhould ſee every thing done ſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that you would ſcarce harbour the leaſt doubt of your comprehending the whole Art: Yet if I ſhould not diſcloſe to You, that the Veſſels, that immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Tinging Ingredients, are to be made of or to be lin'd with Tin, You would never be able by all that I could tell you elſe (at leaſt, if the Famouſeſt and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dideſt Artificers do not ſtrangely delude themſelves) to bring your Tincture of

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough Sir <hi>Robert Morray,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Zulichem</hi> be Perſons that have deſerv'd ſo well of the Commonwealth of Learning, that I ſhould think my ſelf unworthy to be look'd upon as a Member of it, if I declin'd to Obey them, or to Serve them; yet I ſhould not without Reluctancy ſend you the Notes, you deſire for him, if I did not hope that you will tranſmit together with them, ſome Account why they are not leſs unworthy of his peruſal: which, that you may do, I muſt inform you, how
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:56394:220"/>
the writing of them was Occaſion'd, which in ſhort was thus. As I was juſt going out of Town, hearing that an Ingenious Gentleman of my Acquaintance, lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from <hi>Italy,</hi> had a Diamond, that being rubb'd, would ſhine in the Dark, and that he was not far off, I ſnatch'd time from my Occaſions to make him a Viſit, but finding him ready to go abroad, and having in vain try'd to make the Stone yield any Light in the Day time, I borrow'd it of him for that Night, upon condition to reſtore it him within a Day or two at fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, at <hi>Greſham</hi> College, where we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to attend the meeting of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that was then to be at that place. And hereupon I haſted that Evening out of Town, and finding after Supper that the Stone which in the Day time would afford no diſcernable Light, was really Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in the Dark, I was ſo taken with the Novelty, and ſo deſirous to make ſome uſe of an opportunity that was like to laſt ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a while, that though at that time I had no body to aſſiſt me but a Foot-Boy, yet ſitting up late, I made a ſhift that Night to try a pretty number of ſuch of the things that then came into my thoughts, as were not in that place and time unpracticable. And the next Day being otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:56394:220"/>
I was fain to make uſe of a drowſie part of the Night to ſet down haſtily in Writing what I had obſerv'd, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having the time in the Morning, to ſtay the tranſcribing of it, I order'd the Obſervations to be brought after me to <hi>Greſham</hi> College, where you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that they were together with the Stone it ſelf ſhown to the Royal Society, by which they had the good Fortune not to be diſlik'd, though ſeveral things were through haſt omitted, ſome of which you will find in the Margin of the incloſed Paper. The ſubſtance of this ſhort Narrative I hope you will let Monſieur <hi>Zulichem</hi> know, that he may be kept from expecting any thing of finiſh'd in the Obſervations, and be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to excuſe the want of it. But ſuch as they are, I hope they will prove (without a Clinch) Luciferous Experiments, by ſetting the Speculations of the Curious on work, in a diligent Inquiry after the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Light, towards the diſcovery of which, perhaps they have not yet met with ſo conſiderable an Experiment, ſince here we ſee Light produc'd in a dead and opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Body, and that not as in rotten Wood, or in Fiſhes, or as in the <hi>Bolonian</hi> Stone, by a Natural Corruption, or by a
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:56394:221"/>
Violent Deſtruction of the Texture of the Body, but by ſo ſlight a Mechanical opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon its Texture, as we ſeem to know what it is, and as is immediately perform'd, and that ſeveral wayes without at all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing the Body, or making any ſenſible alterations in its Manifeſt Qualities. And I am the more willing to expoſe my haſty Tryals to Monſieur <hi>Zulichem,</hi> and to You, becauſe, he being upon the Conſideration of Dioptricks, ſo odd a <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> relate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Subject, as probably he treats of, Light will, I hope, excite a perſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, that is wont to conſider things he treats of very well. And for you Sir, I hope you will both recrute and perfect the Obſervations you receive, For you know that I cannot add to them, having a good while ſince reſtor'd to Mr. <hi>Clayton</hi> the Stone, which though it be now in the hands of a Prince that ſo highly deſerves, by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding them, the greateſt Curioſities; yet he vouchſafes you that acceſs to him as keeps me from doubting, you may eaſily obtain leave to make further Tryals with it, of ſuch a Monarch as ours, that is not more inquiſitive himſelf, than a favourer of them that are ſo. I doubt not but theſe Notes will put you in mind of the Motion you made to the Society, to impoſe upon
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:56394:221"/>
me the Task of bringing in, what I had on other occaſions obſerv'd concerning ſhining Bodies. But though I deny not, that I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made obſervations about the <hi>Bolonian</hi> Stone, and try'd ſome Experiments about ſome other ſhining Bodies; Yet the ſame Reaſons that reduc'd me then to be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive ev'n their commands, muſt now be my Apology for not anſwering your Expectations, Namely the abſtruſe nature of Light, and my being already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden'd, and but too much kept imploy'd by the Urgency of the Preſs, as well as by more concerning and diſtracting Occaſions. But yet I will tell you ſome part of what I have met with in reference to the Stone, of which I ſend you an account. Becauſe I find on the one ſide, that a great many think it no Rarity upon a miſtaken perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that not only there are ſtore of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, of which this is one; but that all Diamonds and other Gliſtering Jewels ſhine in the Dark. Whereas on the other ſide there are very Learn'd Men, who (plauſibly enough) deny that there are any Carbuncles or ſhining Stones at all.</p>
                  <p>And certainly, thoſe Judicious men have much more to ſay for themſelves, than the others commonly Plead, and therefore did deſervedly look upon Mr. <hi>Clayton</hi>'s Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:56394:222"/>
as a great Rarity. For not only <hi>Boetius de Boot,</hi> who is judg'd the beſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor on this Subject; aſcribes no ſuch Virtue to Diamonds, but begins what he delivers of Carbuncles, with this paſſage. <hi>Magna fama est Carbunculi.

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:56394:222"/>
in tenebris instar Anthracis non luceat: Aſt talem Carbunculum in rerum naturâ non inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niri major pars Authorum exiſtimant. Licet unum aut alterum in India apud Magnates quoſdam reperiri ſcribant, cum tamen ex alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum relatione id habeant ſaltem, ſed ipſi non viderint.</hi> In confirmation of which I ſhall only add, that hearing of a Rubie, ſo very Vivid, that the Jewellers themſelves have ſeveral times begg'd leave of the fair Lady to whom it belong'd, that they might try their choiceſt Rubies by comparing them with That, I had the Opportunity by the Favour of this Lady and her Husband, (both which I have the Honour to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with) to make a Trial of this famous Rubie in the Night, and in a Room well Darkn'd, but not only could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any thing of Light, by looking on the Stone before any thing had been done to it, but could not by all my Rubbing bring it to afford the leaſt Glimmering of Light.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, though I be very backward to admit ſtrange things for truths, yet I am not very forward to reject them as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and therefore I would not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage any from making further Inquiry, whether or no there be Really in <hi>Rerum natura,</hi> any ſuch thing as a true Carbuncle or Stone that without Rubbing will ſhine
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:56394:223"/>
in the Dark. For if ſuch a thing can be found, it may afford no ſmall Aſſiſtance to the Curious in the Inveſtigation of Light, beſides the Nobleneſs and Rarity of the thing it ſelfe. And though <hi>Vartomannus</hi> was not an Eye witneſs of what he relates, that the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> one of the Chief Kings of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> had a true Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle of that Bigneſs and Splendour, that it ſhin'd very Gloriouſly in the Dark, and though <hi>Garcias ab Horto,</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Vice-Roys Phyſician, ſpeaks of another Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle, only upon the Report of one, that he Diſcours'd with, who affirmed himſelf to have ſeen it; yet as we are not ſure that theſe Men that gave themſelves out to be Eye-witneſſes ſpeak true, yet they may have done ſo for ought we know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And I could preſent you with a much conſiderabler Teſtimony to the ſame purpoſe, if I had the permiſſion of a Perſon concern'd, without whoſe leave I muſt not do it. I might tell you that <hi>Marcus Paulus Venetus</hi> (whoſe ſuppos'd Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, divers of our later Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellours <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Purchas's</hi> Pilgrim. lib. 1. cap. 4. pag. 104.</note> and Navigatours have ſince found to be truths) ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the King of <hi>Zeilan</hi> that then was, tells us, that he was ſaid to have the beſt Rubie in the World, a Palm long and as
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:56394:223"/>
big as a mans Arm, without ſpot, ſhining like a Fire, and he ſubjoyns, that the Great <hi>Cham,</hi> under whom <hi>Paulus</hi> was a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Officer, ſent and offer'd the value of a City for it; But the King anſwer'd, he would not give it for the Treaſure of the World, nor part with it, having been his Anceſtours. And I could add, that in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation made by two <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks of their Journey into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In the year 1619.</note> written to their Emperour, they mention'd their having been told by the people of thoſe parts, that their King had a Stone, which Lights as the Sun both Day and Night, call'd in their Language <hi>Surra,</hi> which thoſe Coſſacks interpret a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. But theſe Relations are too uncertain for me to build any thing upon, and therefore I ſhall proceed to tell you, that there came hither about two years ſince out of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> the Governour of one of the Principal Colonies there, an Ancient <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> and one that has the Honour to be a member of the Royal Society; this Gentleman finding ſome of the chief Affairs of his Country committed to another and me, made me divers Viſits, and in one of them when I enquir'd what Rate Stones they had in thoſe parts of the <hi>Indies</hi> he belong'd to, he told me, that the <hi>Indians</hi> had a Tradition
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:56394:224"/>
that in a certain hardly acceſſible Hill, a pretty way up in the Country, there was a Stone which in the Night time ſhin'd very vividly, and to a great diſtance, and he aſſur'd me, that though he thought it not fit to venture himſelf ſo far among thoſe Savages, yet he purpoſely ſent thither a bold <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> with ſome Natives to be his guides, and that this Meſſenger brought him back word, that at a diſtance from the Hillock he had plainly perceiv'd ſuch a ſhining Subſtance as the <hi>Indians</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition mention'd, and being ſtimulated by Curioſity, had ſlighted thoſe Superſtitious Fears of the Inhabitants, and with much ado by reaſon of the Difficulty of the way, had made a ſhift to clamber up to that part of the Hill, where, by a very heedful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, he ſuppos'd himſelf to have ſeen the Light: but whether 'twere that he had miſtaken the place, or for ſome other Reaſon, he could not find it there, though when he was return'd to his former Station, he did agen ſee the Light ſhining in the ſame place where it ſhone before. A fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Account of this Light I expect from the Gentleman that gave me this, who lately ſent me the news of his being landed in that Country. And though I reſerve to my ſelf a full Liberty of Believing no more
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:56394:224"/>
than I ſee cauſe; yet I do the leſs ſcruple to relate this, becauſe a good part of it agrees well enough with another Story that I ſhall in the next place have occaſion to ſubjoyn, in order whereunto I ſhall tell you, that though the Learned Authors I formerly mention'd, tell us, that no Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has affirm'd his having himſelf ſeen a real Carbuncle, yet, conſidering the Light of Mr. <hi>Claytons</hi> Diamond, it recall'd into my mind, that ſome years before, when I was Inquiſitive about Stones, I had met with an old <hi>Italian</hi> Book highly extoll'd to me by very competent Judges, and that though the Book were very ſcarce, I had purchas'd it at a dear Rate, for the ſake of a few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable paſſages I met with in it, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly one, which being very remarkable in it ſelf, and pertinent to our preſent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I ſhall put it for you, though not word for word, which I fear I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to do, yet as to the Senſe, into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>

                     <hi>the ſeventh's time, I happen'd to ſee one of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:56394:225"/>
them at a certain</hi> Raguſian <hi>Merchants, nam'd</hi> Beigoio di Bona, <hi>This was a Carbuncle white, of that kind of Whiteneſs which we ſaid was to be found in thoſe Rubies of which we made mention a little above,</hi> (where he had ſaid that thoſe Rubies had a kind of Livid Whiteneſs or Paleneſs like that of a Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian) <hi>but it had in it a Luſtre ſo pleaſing and ſo marveilous, that it ſhin'd in the Dark, but not as much as colour'd Carbuncles, though it he true, that in an exceeding Dark place I ſaw it ſhine in the manner of fire almoſt gone out. But as for colour'd Carbuncles, it has not been my Fortune to have ſeen any, wherefore I will onely ſet down what I Learn'd about them Diſcourſing in my Youth with a</hi> Roman <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of antient Experience in matters of Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, who told me, That one</hi> Jacopo Cola <hi>being by Night in a Vineyard of his, and eſpying ſomething in the midst of it, that ſhin'd like a little</hi> glowing Coal, at the foot of a Vine, went near towards the place where he thought himſelf to have ſeen that fire, but not finding it, he ſaid, that being return'd to the ſame place, whence he had firſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry'd it, and perceiving there the ſame ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor as before, he mark'd it ſo heedfully, that he came at length to it, where he took up a very little Stone, which he carry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with Tranſports and Joy. And the next
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:56394:225"/>
day carrying it about to ſhow it divers of his Friends, whilſt he was relating after what manner he found it, there caſually interven'd a <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadour, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly expert in Jewels, who preſently know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be a Carbuncle, did craftily before he and the ſaid <hi>Jacopo</hi> parted (ſo that there was no Body preſent that underſtood the Worth of ſo Precious a Gemm) purchaſe it for the Value of 10. Crowns, and the next day left <hi>Rome</hi> to ſhun the being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to reſtore it, and (as he affirm'd) it was known within ſome while after that the ſaid <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentleman did in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſell that Carbuncle to the then Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, newly come to the Empire, for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Crowns. <hi>And this is what I can ſay</hi> concerning <hi>Carbuncles,</hi> and this is not a little at leaſt as to the firſt part of this account, where our <hi>Cellini</hi> affirms himſelf to have ſeen a Real Carbuncle with his own Eyes, eſpecially ſince this Author ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears wary in what he delivers, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd rather to leſſen, than increaſe the wonder of it. And his Teſtimony is the more conſiderable, becauſe though he were born a Subject neither to the Pope nor the then King of <hi>France</hi> (that Royal <hi>Virtuoſo Francis</hi> the firſt) yet both the one and the other of thoſe Princes imploy'd him much
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:56394:226"/>
about making of their Nobleſt Jewels. What is now reported concerning a Shining Subſtance to be ſeen in one of the Iſlands about <hi>Scotland,</hi> were very improper for me to mention to Sr. <hi>Robert Morray,</hi> to whom the firſt. Information was Originally brought, and from whom I expect a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (for I ſcarce dare expect a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing) account of it. But I muſt not omit that ſome <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> queſtioning me the other day at <hi>White-Hall</hi> about Mr. <hi>Claytons</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and meeting amongſt them an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Dutch</hi> Gentleman, whoſe Father was long Embaſſador for the Netherlands in <hi>England,</hi> I Learn'd of him, that, he is acquainted with a perſon, whoſe Name he told (but I do not well remember it) who was Admiral of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and who aſſur'd this Gentleman <hi>Monſieur Boreel,</hi> that at his return from thence he brought back with him into <hi>Holland</hi> a Stone, which though it look'd but like a Pale Dull Diamond, ſuch as he ſaw Mr. <hi>Claytons</hi> to be, yet was it a Real Carbuncle, and did without rubbing ſhine ſo much, that when the Admiral had occaſion to open a Cheſt which he kept under Deck in a Dark place, where 'twas forbidden to bring Candles for fear of Mischances, as ſoon as he open'd the Trunck, the Stone
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:56394:226"/>
would by its Native Light, ſhine ſo as to Illuſtrate a great part of it, and this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman having very civilly and readily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me the requeſt I made him, to Write to the Admiral, who is yet alive in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (and probably may ſtill have the Jewel by him,) for a particular account of this Stone, I hope ere long to receive it, which will be the more welcome to me, not onely becauſe ſo unlikely a thing needs a cleer evidence, but becauſe I have had ſome ſuſpition of that (ſuppoſing the truth of the thing) what may be a ſhining Stone in a very hot Countrey as the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> may perhaps ceaſe to be ſo (at leaſt in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeaſons,) in one as cold as <hi>Holland.</hi> For I obſerv'd in the Diamond I ſend you an account of, that not onely rubbing but a very moderate degree of warmth, though excited by other wayes, would make it ſhine a little. And 'tis not impoſſible that there may be Stones as much more ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible than that, of the Alterations requiſite to make a Diamond ſhine, as that appeares to be more ſuſceptible of them, than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diamonds. And I confeſs to you, that this is not the only odd ſuſpition (for they are not ſo much as conjectures) that what I try'd upon this Diamond ſuggeſted to me. For not here to entertain you with the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:56394:227"/>
changes I think may be effected ev'n in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſorts of Stones, by wayes not vulgar, nor very promiſing, becauſe I may elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where have occaſion to ſpeak of them, and this Letter is but too Prolix already, that which I ſhall now acknowledge to you is, That I began to doubt whether there may not in ſome Caſes be ſome Truth in what is ſaid of the right Turquois, that it often changes Colour as the wearer is Sick or Well, and manifeſtly loſes its ſplendor at his Death. For when I found that ev'n the warmth of an Affriction that laſted not above a quarter of a minute, Nay, that of my Body, (whoſe Conſtitution you know is none of the hotteſt) would make a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt change in the ſolideſt of Stones a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond, it ſeem'd not impoſſible, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain warm and Saline ſteams iſſuing from the Pody of a living man, may by their plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or paucity, or by their peculiar Nature, or by the total abſence of them, diverſifie the Colour, and the ſplendor of ſo ſoft a Stone as the Turquois. And though I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd to ſee, that I know not how many Men otherwiſe Learn'd, ſhould confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcribe to Jewels ſuch Virtues as ſeem no way competible to Inanimate Agents, if to any Corporeal ones at all, yet as to what is affirm'd concerning the Turquois'<hi>s</hi>
                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:56394:227"/>
changing Colour, I know not well how to reject the Affirmation of ſo Learned (and which in this caſe is much more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) ſo Judicious a Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary as <hi>Boetius de Boot</hi>

a Narrative of the Turquois's changing Colour, that I cannot but think it worth your Peruſal, eſpecially ſince a much later and very Experienc'd Author, <hi>Olaus Wormius,</hi> where he treats of that Stone, Confirms it with this <note place="margin">Olaus Wormius in Muſae. 18<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>pag.</hi> 186.</note> Teſtimony. <hi>Imprimis memorandum exemplum quod Anſhelmus Boëtius de ſeipſo refert, tam mutati Coloris, quam à caſu preſervationis.

And I having encourag'd to make Pictures from time to time of the Stone, and of the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the cloudy parts, that ſo their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be more indiſputable, and better obſerv'd, he came to me about the midle of this very week, and aſſur'd me that he had, as I wiſh'd, made from time to time Schemes or Pictures of the differing parts of the Stone, whereby the ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves and motions of the above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clouds are very manifeſt, though the cauſe ſeem'd to him very occult: theſe Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:56394:228"/>
he has promis'd to ſhow me, and is very ready to put the Stone it ſelf into my hands. But the ring having been the other day caſually broken upon his finger, unleſs it can be taken out, and ſet again without any conſiderable heat, he is loath to have it medled with, for fear its peculiarity ſhould be thereby deſtroy'd. And poſſibly his apprehenſion would have been ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd, if I had had opportunity to tell him what is reladed by <note place="margin">Muſae. Worm, <hi>pag.</hi> 99.</note> the Learned <hi>Wormius</hi> of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of his, that had a <hi>Nephritick</hi> ſtone, of whoſe eminent Virtues he had often Experience ev'n in himſelf, and for that cauſe wore it ſtill about his Wriſt; and yet going upon a time into a Bath of fair Water only, wherein certain Herbs had been boyl'd, the Stone by being wetted with this decoction, was depriv'd of all his Virtue, whence <hi>Wormius</hi> takes Occaſion to advertiſe the ſick, to lay by ſuch ſtones whenſoever they make uſe of a Bath. And we might expect to find <hi>Turcos</hi> likewiſe, eaſily to be wrought upon in point of Colour, if that were true, which the curious <hi>Antonio Neri,</hi> in his ingenious <hi>Arte Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traria</hi> teaches of it, namely, That <note place="margin">Arte Vetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, lib. 7. cap. 102.</note>

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:56394:229"/>
an excellent Colour, if you but keep them two or three days at moſt cover'd with Oyl of ſweet Almonds kept in a temperate heat by warm aſhes, I ſay if it were true, becauſe I doubt whether it be ſo, and have not as yet had opportunity to ſatisfie my ſelf by Tryals, becauſe I find by the confeſſion of the moſt Skilfull Perſons among whom I have laid out for <hi>Turcoiſes,</hi> that the, true ones are great rarities, though others be not at all ſo. And therefore I ſhall now only mind you of one thing that you know as well as I, namely, that the rare Stone which is called <hi>Oculus Mundi,</hi> if it be good in its Kind, will have ſo great a change made in its Texture by being barely left a while in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guideſt of Liquors, common Waters, that from Opacous it will become Tranſparent, and acquire a Luſtre of which it will again be depriv'd, without uſing any other Art or Violence, by leaving it a while in the Air. And before experience had ſatisfy'd us of the truth of this, it ſeem'd as unlikely that common Water or Air, ſhould work ſuch great changes in that Gemm, as it now ſeems that the Effluviums of a human Body ſhould effect leſſer changes in a <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cois,</hi> eſpecially if more ſuſceptible of them, than other Stones of the ſame kind. But both my Watch and my Eyes tell me that

'tis now high time to think of going to ſleep, matters of this Nature, will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as more eaſily, clear'd by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, than Writing. And therefore ſince I think you know me too well to make it needfull for me to diſclame Credulity, notwithſtanding my having entertain'd you with all theſe Extravagancies; for you know well, how wide a difference I am wont to put betwixt things that barely <hi>may be,</hi> and things that <hi>are,</hi> and between thoſe Relations that are but not unworthy to be inquir'd into, and thoſe that are not worthy to be actually believ'd; without making Apologies for my Ravings, I ſhall readily comply with the drowſineſs that calls upon me to releaſe You, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe Monſieur <hi>Zulichem</hi> being concern'd in your deſire to know the few things I have obſerved about the ſhining Stone.

                     <hi>October</hi> 1663. about Mr. <hi>Clayton</hi>'s Diamond.</head>
                  <p>BEing look'd on in the Day time, <note place="margin">Hast made me forget to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the ſame Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Sun ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forth clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to look upon the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond through a <hi>Microſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope,</hi> that I might try whether by that Magnifying Glaſs any thing of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar could be diſcern'd in the Texture of the Stone, and eſpecially of the whitiſh Cloud that poſſeſt a good part of it. But for all my attention I could not diſcover any peculiarity worth mentioning.</note> though in a Bed, whoſe Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were carefulſy drawn, I could not diſcern it to Shine at all, though well Rubb'd, but about a little after Sun-ſet, whilſt the Twilight yet laſted, Nay, this Morning a pretty while after Sun-riſing, (but before I had been abroad in the more freely inlightned Air of the Chamber) I could upon a light Affriction eaſily perceive the Stone to Shine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="414" facs="tcp:56394:231"/>
Secondly, The Candles being removed, I could not in a Dark place diſcern the Stone to have any Light, when I looked on it, without having Rubb'd or otherwiſe prepar'd it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By two white Pibbles though hard Rubb'd one againſt another, nor by the long and vehement Affriction of Rock Cryſtal againſt a piece of Red cloath, nor yet by Rubbing two Diamonds ſet in Ring, as I had Rubb'd this Stone, I could produce any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible degree of Light.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I found this Diamond hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, not only to enable me to write readily with it upon Glaſs, but to Grave on Rock Cryſtal it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I found this to have like other Diamonds, an Electrical fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>V.</hi> For it drew light Bodies like Amber, Jet, and other Concretes that are noted to do ſo; But its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive power ſeem'd inferiour to theirs.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Being rubb'd upon my Cloaths, as is uſual for the exciting of Amber, Wax, and other Electrical Bodies, it did in the Dark manifeſtly ſhine like Rotten Wood, or the Scales of Whitings, or other putrified Fiſh.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, But this Conſpicuouſneſs was Fainter than that of the Scales, and Slabber (if I may ſo call it) of Whitings, and much Fainter than the Light of a Glow-worm, by
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:56394:231"/>
which I have been ſometimes able to Read a ſhort Word, whereas after an ordinary Affriction of this Diamond I was not able to diſcern diſtinctly by the Light of it any of the neareſt Bodies: And this Glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo did very manifeſtly and conſiderably Decay preſently upon the ceaſing of the Affriction, though the Stone continued Viſible ſome while after.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, But if it were Rubb'd upon a convenient Body for a pretty while, and Briskly enough, I found the Light would be for ſome moments much more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, almoſt like the Light of a Glow-worm, inſomuch after I ceaſed Rubbing, I could with the Chaf'd ſtone exhibit a little Luminous Circle, like that, but not ſo bright as that which Children make by moving a ſtick Fir'd at the end, and in this caſe it would continue Viſible about ſeven or eight times as long as I had been in Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, I found that holding <note place="margin">
                        <hi>IX.</hi> We durſt not hold it in the Flame of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, no more than put it into a naked Fire; For fear too Violent a Heat (which has been obſerv'd to ſpoil many other precious Stones) ſhould vitiate and impair a Jewel, that was but borrow'd, and was ſuppos'd to be the only one of its Kind.</note> it a while near the Flame of a Candle, (from which yet I was carefull to avert my Eyes) and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:56394:232"/>
being immediately remov'd into the Dark, it diſcloſed ſome faint Glimmering, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to that, it was wont to acquire by Rubbing. And afterward holding it near a Fire that had but little Flame, I found the Stone to be rather leſs than more excited, than it had been by the Candle.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, I likewiſe indeavour'd to make it Shine, by holding it a pretty while in a very Dark place, over a thick piece of Iron, that was well Heated, but not to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as to be Viſibly ſo. And though at length I found, that by this way alſo, the Stone acquired ſome Glimmering, yet it was leſs than by either of the other ways above mention'd.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, I alſo brought it to ſome kind of Glimmering Light, by taking it into Bed with me, and holding it a good while upon a warm part of my Naked Body.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, To ſatisfie my ſelf, whether the Motion introduc'd into the Stone did generate the Light upon the account of its producing Heat there, I held it near the Flame of a Candle, till it was qualify'd to ſhine pretty well in the Dark, and then immediately I apply'd a ſlender Hair to try whether it would attract it, but found not that it did ſo; though if it were made to
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:56394:232"/>
ſhine by Rubbing, it was as I formerly noted Electrical. And for further Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, though I once purpoſedly kept it ſo near the hot Iron I juſt now mention'd, as to make it ſenſibly Warm, yet it ſhin'd more Dimly than it had done by Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or the Flame of a Candle, though by both thoſe ways it had not acquir'd any warmth that was ſenſible.</p>
                  <p>Thirteenthly, Having purpoſely rubb'd it upon ſeveral Bodies differing as to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and as to Texture, there ſeem'd to be ſome little Diſparity in the excitation (if I may ſo call it) of Light. Upon White and Red Cloths it ſeem'd to ſucceed beſt, eſpecially in compariſon of Black ones.</p>
                  <p>Fourteenthly, But to try what it would do rubb'd upon Bodies more hard, and leſs apt to yield Heat upon a light Affriction, than Cloath, I firſt rubb'd it upon a white wooden Box, by which it was excited, and afterwards upon a piece of purely Glazed Earth, which ſeem'd during the Attrition to make it Shine better than any of the other Bodies had done, without excepting the White ones, which I add, leſt the Effect ſhould be wholly aſcrib'd to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition White Bodies are wont to have to Reflect much Light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="418" facs="tcp:56394:233"/>
Fifteenthly, Having well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Stone, I nimbly plung'd <note place="margin">
                        <hi>XV.</hi> We likewiſe Plung'd it as ſoon as we had excited it, under Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors of ſeveral ſorts, as Spirit of Wine, Oyl both Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical and expreſs'd, an Acid Spirit, and as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calizate Solution, and found not any of thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors to deſtroy its Shining property.</note> it under Water, that I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for that purpoſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it to Shine whilſt it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Surface of that Liquor, and this I did divers times. But when I indeavour'd to produce a Light by rubbing it upon the lately mentioned Cover of the Box, the Stone and it being both held beneath the Surface of the Water, I did not well ſatisfie my ſelf in the Event of the Trial; But this I found, if I took the Stone out, and Rubb'd it upon a piece of Cloath, it would not as elſe it was wont to do, preſently acquire a Luminouſneſs, but need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be rubb'd manifeſtly much longer before the deſired Effect was found.</p>
                  <p>Sixteenthly, I alſo try'd ſeveral <note place="margin">
                        <hi>XVI.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found by this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that a warm Liquor would not extinguiſh Light in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, I thought fit to try, whether by reaſon of its warmth it would not excite it, and divers times I found, that if it were kept therein, till the Water had leiſure to communicate ſome of its Heat to it, it would often ſhine as ſoon as it was taken out, and probably we ſhould have ſeen it Shine more, whilſt it was in the Water, if ſome degree of Opacity which heated Water is wont to acquire, upon the ſcore of the Numerous little Bubbles generated in it, had not kept us from diſcerning the Luſtre of the Stone.</note> times, that by covering it with my
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:56394:233"/>
warm Spittle (having no warm Water at hand) it did not loſe his Light.</p>
                  <p>Seventeenthly, Finding that by Rubbing the Stone with the Flat ſide downwards, I did by reaſon of the Opacity of the Ring, and the ſudden Decay of Light upon the ceaſing of the Attrition, probably loſe the ſight of the Stones greateſt Vividneſs; and ſuppoſing that the Commotion made in one part of the Stone will be eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated all over, I ſometimes held the piece of Cloath upon which I rubb'd it, ſo, that one ſide of the Stone was expoſed to my Eye, whilſt I was rubbing the other, whereby it appear'd more Vivid than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and to make Luminous Tracts by its Motions too and fro. And ſometimes holding the Stone upwards, I rubb'd its Broad ſide with a fine ſmooth piece of Tranſparent Horn, by which means the Light through that Diaphauous Subſtance, did whilſt I was actually rubbing the Stone, appear ſo Brisk, that ſometimes and in ſome places it ſeem'd to have little Sparks of Fire.</p>
                  <p>Eighteenthly, I took alſo a piece of flat Blew Glaſs, and having rubb'd the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond well upon a Cloath, and nimbly clapt the Glaſs upon it, to try whether in caſe the Light could peirce it, it would by
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:56394:234"/>
appearing Green, or of ſome other Colour than Blew, aſſiſt me to gueſs whether it ſelf were ſincere or no. But finding the Glaſs impervious to ſo faint a Light, I then thought it fit to try whether that hard Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies would not by Attrition increaſe the Diamonds Light ſo as to become pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable thereby, and accordingly when I rubb'd the Glaſs briskly upon the Stone, I found the Light to be Conſpicuous enough, and ſomewhat Dy'd in its paſſage, but found it not eaſie to give a Name to the Colour it exhibited.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To comply with the Suſpition I had upon the whole Matter, that the chief manifeſt Change wrought in the Stone, was by Compreſſion of its parts, rather than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caleſcence, I took a piece of white Tile well Glaz'd, and if I preſs'd the Stone hard againſt it, it ſeem'd though I did not rub it to and fro, to ſhine at the Sides: And however it did both very manifeſtly and vigorouſly Shine, if whilſt I ſo preſs'd it, I mov'd it any way upon the Surface of the Tile, though I did not make it draw a Line of above a quarter of an Inch long, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. And though I made it not move to and 'fro, but only from one end of the ſhort Line to the other, without any return or Lateral motion. Nay, after it had been

often rubb'd, and ſuffer'd to loſe its Light again, not only it ſeem'd more eaſie to be excited than at the beginning of the Night; but if I did preſs hard upon it with my Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, at the very inſtant that I drew it briskly off, it would diſcloſe a very Vivid but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſhort Liv'd Splendour, not to call it a little Coruſcation. <note n="*" place="margin">I after bethought my ſelf of imploying a way, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the deſir'd Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect both ſooner and better. For holding betwixt my Fingers a Steel Bodkin, near the Lower part of it, I preſs'd the point hard againſt the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Diamond, and much more if I ſtruck the point againſt it, the Coruſcation would be extremely ſuddain, and very Vivid, though very Vaniſhing too, and this way which commonly much ſurpris'd and pleas'd the Spectators, ſeem'd far more proper than the other, to ſhow that preſſure alone, if for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible enough, though it were ſo ſuddain, and ſhort, that it could not well be ſuppos'd to give the Stone any thing near a ſenſible degree of Warmth, as may be ſuſpected of Rubbing, yet 'tis ſufficient to generate a very Vivid Light.</note> So that a <hi>Carteſian</hi> would ſcarce ſcruple to think he had found in this Stone no ſlight Confirmation of his Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Maſters <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> touching the Generation of Light in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary Bodies, not ſenſibly Hot.</p>

                     <note place="margin">We after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, try'd precious Stones, as Diamonds, Rubies, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phires, and Emeralls, &amp;c. but found not any of them to Shine except ſome Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and of theſe we were not upon ſo little practice, able to fore-tell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, which would be brought to Shine, and which would not; For ſeveral very good Diamonds, either would not Shine at all, or much leſs than others that were farr inferiour to them. And yet thoſe Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Men are miſtaken, that think a Diamond muſt be foul and cloudy, as Mr. <hi>Claytons</hi> was, to be fit for Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for as we could bring ſome ſuch to afford a Glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Light, ſo with ſome clear and excellent Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, we could do the like. But none of thoſe many that we try'd of all Kinds, were equal to the Diamond on which the Obſervations were made, not only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the degree of Light it affotded, but the eaſineſs wherewith it was excited, and the Comparatively great duration of its Shining.</note> 
                     <hi>make this Stone appear a kind of Prodigie, and the rather, becauſe having try'd as I formerly noted, not only a fine Artificial Cryſtal, and ſome alſo that is Natural, but a Ruby and two Diamonds, I did not find that any of theſe diſclos'd the like Glimmering of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:56394:235"/>
Light; yet after all, perceiving by the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Teſtimony of a Skilfull Gold-ſmith, that this was rather a Natural than Artificial Stone; for fear leſt there might be ſome difference in the way of Setting, or in the ſhape of the Diamonds I made uſe of, neither of which was like this, a flat Table-ſtone, I thought fit to make a farther Trial of my own Diamonds, by ſuch a brisk and aſſiduous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friction as might make amends for the Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages above-mention'd, in caſe they were the cauſe of the unſucceſsfulneſs of the former Attempts: And accordingly I found, that by this way I could eaſily bring a Diamond I wore on my Finger to diſcloſe a Light, that was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible enough, and continued ſo though I cover'd it with Spittle, and us'd ſome other Trials about it. And this will much leſſen the wonder of all the formerly mention'd Obſervations, by ſhewing that the properties that are ſo ſtrange are not peculiar to one Diamond, but may be found in others alſo, and perhaps in divers other hard and</hi> Diaphanous <hi>Stones. Yet I hope that what this Diſcovery takes away from the Wonder of theſe Obſervations, it will add to the Inſtructiveneſs of them, by affording preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants Hints, towards the Investigation of the Nature of Light.</hi>
