            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I <hi>Do not think it necessary to write any thing in the way of</hi> Preface <hi>to so short a</hi> Book; <hi>but since there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a long</hi> Preface <hi>before the</hi> French <hi>Translation of my</hi> Reflections, <hi>to which Mr.</hi> Varillas <hi>has made some sort of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. The same</hi> worthy Person, <hi>having given himself the trouble to translate likewise my</hi> Reply <hi>thought it necessary to say somewhat in Defence of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> Preface: <hi>I have translated that into</hi> English, <hi>since it gives a further disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Mr.</hi> Varillas's <hi>sincerity.</hi>

                  <head>The <hi>Translator's</hi> PREFACE, <hi>Put in</hi> English.</head>
                  <p>I Had accused Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> in the <hi>Preface</hi> which I had set before Dr. <hi>Burnet's Reflections,</hi> that he had in his <hi>History of Heresies</hi> contradicted several things which he had affirmed some years before that, in his <hi>History of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaffianism:</hi> for tho the two first Books of the <hi>former,</hi> are indeed the same work with the <hi>latter,</hi> as to the main parts of them; yet several considerable Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were observed to be between them: many things being left out in the <hi>History of Heresies,</hi> which were in that of <hi>Wickliffianism.</hi> To all this Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> answers, in a few words; and says, 1. <hi>That the History of</hi> Wickliffia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism <hi>was printed without his knowledg.</hi> 2. <hi>That his Name was not prefixed to it.</hi> 3. <hi>That tho it contained indeed seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things that were taken from him, yet it contained others that were none of his.</hi> 4. <hi>That he not only never owned that Book for his, but that he moved to have it suppressed: and that at his Instance an
<pb facs="tcp:57150:3"/>
Order of Council was granted, for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing it, and for fining the Printer in 600. Livres: From all which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that he is not at all accountable for any thing that is in that Book: and that no Inferences ought to be drawn from it to his prejudice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, that it cannot be proved that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> sold the <hi>Copy</hi> to <hi>Certe,</hi> the Merchant of <hi>Lions</hi>: but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he pay'd dear for it; and that the <hi>Copy</hi> that was sold him, was very clean writ; and that there were some Marginal Notes writ upon it, by another hand, tho these were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of great Consequence: The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner was also so much scandalised, when he saw, that <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented so advantagiously, and that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> was so ill spoke of, that he intended to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the <hi>Copy</hi> a little; but in that he was not left to his Liberty. The <hi>Book</hi> was printed, and sold publickly, both at <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Grenoble,</hi> for some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time: and it passed generally for Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s Book, both among the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>: The more moderate of the
<pb facs="tcp:57150:4"/>
                     <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> recommended the Book to the <hi>Protestants,</hi> as an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to convince them, that there were Writers in their Church, that even in Matters of Consequence, durst say the Truth very boldly. Nor was it then so much as pretended by any person whatsoever, that there were any Passages foisted in, which were not of the Authors Writing. The Book was not only looked on as writ by Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> in the remoter <hi>Provinces,</hi> but even in <hi>Paris</hi> it self it past for his: and this report went so current, that Mr. <hi>la Rogue</hi> spoke of it in his <hi>Iournal</hi> last year,<note n="10" place="margin">
                        <hi>Journal p.</hi> 170. <hi>of the</hi> Amsterd. <hi>Edition.</hi>
                     </note> as a thing of which no doubt had been made: for he tells us, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Varillas <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins his two first Books with the History of</hi> Wickliff, <hi>of</hi> John Hus, <hi>and</hi> Jerome of Prague, <hi>which had already appeared in several Impressions, under the Title of the History of Wickliffianism.</hi> So that it is certain, that the Order of <hi>Council</hi> which Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> procured against the Printer of <hi>Lions,</hi> for suppressing that Book, made no great noise at <hi>Paris,</hi> otherwise the Author of the <hi>Iournal</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57150:4"/>
would have heard of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Preface</hi> that was set before the Edition at <hi>Lions,</hi> is indeed writ by one, who says, that the Author would not give his consent to the printing of the Book: and for that reason, he does not set his Name before it: but he does not say a word of any Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are made to it; tho he shews himself to be both so zealous for his Religion, and so full of esteem for Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> that it is not probable that he would have suffered any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to be made, especially such as those that were marked in the former <hi>Preface.</hi> On the contrary, tho he says, he will not answer, but that there may be some Faults in the Printing, yet he affirms, that none will be found that contradict the Truth of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. I will not be so malicious, as to say, that it is probable this <hi>Preface</hi> was of Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s own composing; since it is not likely that there are many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides himself that think so well of him, as the Writer of that <hi>Preface</hi> does: and the Artifice of Printing Books, by the Authors <hi>themselves,</hi> and yet in the Name of <hi>another,</hi> as if their
<pb facs="tcp:57150:5"/>
consent was not obtained, is so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> may think, that he escapes well, if he is not charged with fouler and more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable Impostures than this is. But it is certain, that all those Additions, which Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> does now reject, and writ in the same stile with the rest of the work, and no man that is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his way of writing, will think, that if he had intended to have said those things, which he now disowns, he would have expressed himself in other Terms. And besides all this, he cannot think it is enough to say, that <hi>there are some things in the History of</hi> Wickliffianism, <hi>that are taken out of his Book</hi>; since the whole Body of the Work is word for word the same, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting those alterations: So that if he would express himself with any sort of sincerity, he ought to have said, <hi>that these two Books weere indeed his.</hi> But since he does not think fit to own those passages, that are now struck out, he ought only to have added, that <hi>some Additions were put into the former Editions without his knowledge</hi>; instead of setting this matter down so
<pb facs="tcp:57150:5"/>
indefinitly as he has done, by which he pretends to cover himself, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow whatsoever passages are abjected to him, as he shall think it convenient for him to do. But it is now a little too late, for Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> to make use of this Excuse: and let him say what he will, he must at least justify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l that is in his <hi>History of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies.</hi> An Ingenious <hi>Author</hi> has lately shewed him, that he has now rendred himself accountable for the former Book, even with all the Faults that were in it. Let him defend himself as he can: but let him not fancy that he will escape a second time, by casting the blame of the Faults that are now in this Edition, as well as they were in the former, over on the <hi>Printers</hi> or <hi>Book-sellers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Council,</hi> it is so far from proving, that the <hi>History of Wickliaffianism</hi> was none of his, as Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> pretends, that it proves the contrary very clearly; for otherwise how could he have obtained it, but by affirming that is was a Book of his, and that a Copy of it was stollen from him. On what other ground could the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57150:6"/>
of <hi>Lions</hi> have been fined: for he had obtained the Licence for printing it, both of the Kings <hi>Advocat</hi> and his <hi>Attorney,</hi> according to the Custom, which is printed at the end of the <hi>Preface,</hi> signed by them both: and it is certain, that such a <hi>Licence</hi> as this, was sufficient to secure the <hi>Stationer</hi> against all prosecution at the Kings sute: nor could Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> found his complaint upon any other ground, but this, <hi>that he was the Author of the Book</hi>; since he could not prosecute the Stationer for printing another mans Book.</p>
                  <p>There is another reason which Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> will not easily answer, that shews him to be the Author of all those retracted Passages; which is, that it is well known, that no man in <hi>France</hi> could be inclined, from any consideration of Interest, to magnify <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> or to decry the <hi>Council of Constance</hi>: on the contrary, this would have been of very ill Consequence to them, and might have brought them into great trouble: so that men will be inclined rather to think, that at first Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> writ his own true senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:57150:6"/>
touching <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and that <hi>Council,</hi> which afterwards he thought fit to suppress, when he saw how much prejudice this might bring him: A man is easily believed when he writes against his Interest, but if it appears, that a man has either a design to raise himself, or at least to preserve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the world is too ill-natured, not to suspect all that he can say, let him use what terms soever he will, when it once appears that these are his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: especially if there is any other occasion given to suspect his sincerity: and in a word, all his complaints of the <hi>Printer</hi> of <hi>Lions,</hi> and even the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of <hi>Council</hi> and <hi>Fine,</hi> will pass with jealous people, but as a Collusion, so that after all, I do very much appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that he greatest part of his <hi>Readers,</hi> will still believe him to be accountable for those suppressed pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, whether he will or not; chiefly when they consider, that there was an effectual means, by which Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi> might have cleared himself of those Imputations, of which he has not made any use: and that was, the refuting by good Evidences all those
<pb facs="tcp:57150:7"/>
                     <hi>Additions,</hi> that were in the <hi>Edition</hi> of <hi>Lions</hi>; and the disproving them by solid Reasons. For it is not enough barely to affirm the contrary, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this case, in which it cannot be denied, but that there are still specious enough Reasons, to induce us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, not withstanding his bare Denial.</p>

two first Tomes of his History of the Revolutions that have hapned in</hi> Europe <hi>in the matters of Religion:<note place="margin">P. 8.</note> This was not a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure of Memory, but a studied Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture: for he represents my design as if it had been against his whole Work, and upon that he charges me for having singled out only some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, of which he mentions a few: and adds, <hi>that tho all these were errors, his first ten Books would deserve still to be believed, since his mistakes were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters of small consequence, and in this there was nothing but that to which any man was subject.</hi> But when I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook only to examin his ninth Book, if I have discovered, that all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to <hi>England</hi> is a contexture of false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, then I am sure I have quite overthrown one of his ten Books; and by overthrowing that, I have very much shaken the credit of all the other nine: since the Faults that I charge on him, are not only some small mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, but a series of Impostures: and the greatest of all is, that he pretends to cite Vouchers which are not in being. I will not say that his Errors
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57150:8"/>
are more than what any man is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to: but I do not know any man that has ever committed so many: <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> charges me for writing against him <hi>in so barbarous a manner, keeping none of the Rules of Decency:</hi> and to let the World see how little he knows the things which he cites, he says, <hi>that the two most passionate Criticks of any Age,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">P. 5.</note> Scaliger <hi>and</hi> Schoppius, <hi>observed these with great exactness</hi>; but for him, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to <hi>play the part of a Christian, and so he will only answer the things in which Truth is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,<note place="margin">P. 10.</note> without regarding those that relate to himself.</hi> I kept all the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures that I thought became a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> with relation to his Person: nor have I said one word of him, but as he is a Writer. I have not sent to <hi>Paris,</hi> to have a series of his life transmitted to me; on the contrary, when some here had offered me, while I writ my <hi>Reflections,</hi> some particulars that were to his prejudice, I would not hearken to them; for I said, I would only exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> as he was an <hi>Author,</hi> but not as he was a Man or a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57150:9"/>
I confess, the confidence with which he asserts so many Impostures, gave me a just Indignation against him, so that I resolved to ruin his credit as he was an <hi>Historian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I saw he deserved it so very ill, and made so bad a use of it: but if he expects, that I measure his being a <hi>Christian</hi> by this <hi>Answer,</hi> I will have as bad an opinion of him that way, as I have of him in the quality of an <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian.</hi> He says, <hi>I have cut off and supprest,<note place="margin">P. 5.</note> and changed his words, that so I might represent them as I thought fit</hi>: But in that I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Reader. I did not think fit to reprint all he had writ, nor will I now reprint his <hi>Answer,</hi> as he has done my <hi>Reflections.</hi> I have indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired my Printer to reprint it by it self, if he finds his account in it: and I think that is sufficient. I confess, I cannot enough wonder at his printing of mine, since it discovers too plainly the defects of his <hi>Answer</hi>; and I am apt to think that his Printer has engaged him to it, as a thing that would have a good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. In this the Printer did wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for he was sure his Book would
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57150:9"/>
go off the better; but Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> did a greater kindness to his Stationer than to himself. Nor do I believe, that he intended it at first; for there are some parts of my <hi>Reflections</hi> so falsly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by him in his <hi>Answer,</hi> that I cannot believe he would have done it, if he had then intended to have printed my <hi>Reflections</hi>: otherwise I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that his judgment and his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity are both of a piece: for Instance, could a man, that had intended to have printed what I had said, concerning the <hi>Lord Darnley, being the next Heir after Queen</hi> Mary <hi>to the Crown of</hi> England,<note place="margin">P. 55, 56, 57.</note> so that he might have been a dangerous competitor to her in that Succession, he having been born and bred in England.</hi> Could, I say, this man pretend that I had affirmed, that the <hi>Lord Darnley</hi> was a dangerous Competitor to her for the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and his putting that in the Citation he makes of my words, instead of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> would appear strange in any other, but in him such strains are so common, that I am not surprised at this; yet he has the Impudence to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57150:10"/>
triumph upon it, and to spend some Pages to shew that her Title was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputed. I find many more Instances of the like foul dealing, which makes me conclude, that <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> did not design at first to print my <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>: and besides this, he copies out sometimes half Pages of my Words, which he would not have done, if he had intended to have given them entire to the Reader: for they are not so much to his advantage, that he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to desire that they should be twice read.</p>
                  <p>He tells the world, <hi>that if he had a mind to imitate my passionate way of writing,<note place="margin">P. 6.</note> and if he would write my life, ever since I was Chaplain to My Lady Dutchess of</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, <hi>to this present time, that I am by my fault become a Citizen of</hi> Holland, <hi>he would write things so singular, that they would make his Answer the most agreeable Book that had been printed of a great while</hi> For this I know there have been men at work both in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to furnish <hi>Mr. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi> with materials to defame me: and because I will conceal nothing that I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57150:10"/>
know that is to his honour, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that he writ back to <hi>England,</hi> that he would not medle with those personal things; and that he wisht, that instead of these, they would send him good <hi>Memorials</hi> relating to the matters in dispute between him and me. This was to act like a fair Enemy, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. But I do not say this to bespeak his Favour, that so he may not print all those Informations that were sent to him from a <hi>Society,</hi> that having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, had a mind to put another on publishing them. Let him print them when he will; for I am not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of all the hurt they can do me: and indeed, if one may judge of this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocha</hi> of my life, by the two <hi>Periods</hi> here mentioned, the writing upon such Informations may very well agree with <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi>'s other <hi>Histories</hi>; for these may be Authors of as good credit, for ought I know, as his <hi>Florimond de Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was. I was never Chaplain to the <hi>Dutchess of Hamilton</hi>; I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this, as judging it any diminution to me, if it had been true: for I do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour both her Person and Family so much, that I would rather value my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57150:11"/>
self upon it, if I had been ever in her Family: but I never was Caplain to any Subject; I was Chaplain to the late <hi>King,</hi> but to no other. The last Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod passes my apprehension; <hi>Mr. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi> reproaches me for the Meanness and Flatness of my <hi>Stile</hi>: for he that penetrates into so many Secrets, that never were, can even judge of an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish stile</hi> by a <hi>translation</hi>: yet since that he is the first who has reproached me for so very bad a stile, I ought to bear this the more patiently: but since he fancies that he has attained the <hi>Sublime</hi> of stile, I would gladly know to which of all <hi>Longins</hi> rules, this expression belongs, that <hi>by my fault I am become a Citizen of Holland. By my fault</hi> seems so odly placed here, and a <hi>Citizen of Holland</hi> is so strang a way of expressing my being <hi>naturalised</hi> by the <hi>States,</hi> and would intimate as if Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s ignorance went so far as to fancy that <hi>Holland</hi> was a <hi>City</hi>; that since there are two sorts of <hi>Sublimes,</hi> the one of <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> and the other of <hi>Eloquence,</hi> I will not take upon me to judge to which of these this belongs. For it is too great a presumption in one whose
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57150:11"/>
stile is so low as mine, to examin the flights of so elevated a Writer. As for the rest of this Memoire, I am very little concerned whether he print it or not. I have behaved my self so of late, as to shew that I am neither afraid of any discoveries that can be made, nor disturbed at any Calumnies, by which my Enemies may endeavour to blacken me: and as I had much rather have <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> print all that has been sent him concerning me, than to publish it up and down <hi>Paris</hi>: so whatever he thinks fit to say of me, shall be either treated by me with the silent scorn, that an ill made Lye deserves, or shall be answered as the matter may happen to require it.</p>
                  <p>But before I enter into any more particular enquiries, I will in general state the whole matter, as it lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> and my <hi>self</hi>: and then I will leave it even to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Reader that may be partial of his side. He had published two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums <hi>of the Revolutions that have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in</hi> Europe, <hi>in the matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>: and with Relation to <hi>English Affairs</hi> he had pretended in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57150:12"/>
that he did found that part of his Work on <hi>Card. de Bellay's Letters,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides several other Papers that he cited on the Margin of his ninth <hi>Book</hi>: but he had given no intimations where any of these were to be found: I had on the other hand writ the <hi>History</hi> of that time, in which I not only cited many <hi>Original Papers,</hi> but had likewise printed the most important of them, and had also told where they were to be found: as for those which I have cited from publick <hi>Records,</hi> they are accessible to all the World, for the greatest part: and for those that are not to be come at but by a Warrant under the <hi>Kings</hi> hand, that is so easily had, and would be so readily granted at present, that I may with some degrees of just assurances say, that I ought to be believed till it can be made appear that I have been guilty of any Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture in those Citations: and the stir that has been made of late to supply <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> with matter against me, and the meanness of those Objections with which they have furnished him, gives me reason to conclude, that they know they cannot accuse me of Fraud
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57150:12"/>
or Forgery, in any of my Citations: as for the other <hi>Original Papers,</hi> that I mention, they are either in the <hi>Cotton Library</hi> in <hi>Corpus Christi Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> or in some other private Hands: but I have cited all these so particularly, as to tell whether my Vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers were <hi>Originals</hi> or <hi>Copies</hi>; and have told so exactly where those of the <hi>Cotton Library</hi> may be found, that a man cannot be a minute there, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to discover, whether I have cited sincerely or not. I had also in my <hi>History</hi> confined my self so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely to the materials with which I was furnished, that I resolved not to add one Tittle to that which appeared clearly to me to be well verified: and tho Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> reproaches me, for <hi>writing so superficially, and for mentioning only publick e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 26.</note> yet I am not ashamed to own that where authentick Proofs failed me: I would not impose upon my Readers so far, as to give them my Imaginations for true History; where I am forced to guess, I warn my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it; and when the grounds on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57150:13"/>
I went seemd which I went seemed to me only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, I advertised my Reader likewise of it: so that I writ my <hi>History</hi> with the same scrupulous exactness, that I would have used, if I had been required to give a deposition upon Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Judge. This being the case, I do not pretend to be believed upon my own Word: I do not say,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 29.</note> 
                     <hi>the state of the Records and Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is altered since I writ</hi>; I do not pretend <hi>that I saw many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in confidence, so that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in honour discover where they are.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> I will not say, that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> proves himself to be an Impostor by such pretences; but I am sure this is the method that an <hi>Impostor</hi> would use: and whenever I pretend to excuse my self in this manner, I am content to past for one. His defence of himself from the four thousand cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Du Tillet,</hi> and <hi>Peter du Puy, that are now all found to be false,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 28.</note> tho he says, <hi>it is as certain they were all true when those Eminent Authors writ,</hi> is another of his <hi>Sublime</hi> strains: for if they are now false, they were false at all times: but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57150:13"/>
if a man that has so low a stile as mine is, dares ofter to correct him, I crave leave to tell him, that he should have said, that <hi>tho the proofs of those Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot now be found, yet there is good reason to believe that those Authors cited them sincerely.</hi> This I guess to be his meaning, tho his <hi>sublime</hi> wants sometimes a little clearness: but it is very probable, that if those Authors had been called to an account for their Citations, they could have answered for themselves in another manner than Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has done. I confess, when I heard that he was writing an <hi>Answer</hi> to my <hi>Reflections,</hi> I could not imagin where he could attack me: I knew I had Authentick proofs for all that I had laid to his charge; yet I fancied he might have seen some <hi>Letters</hi> of that time, in which those matters had been represented as he relates them: For false newes are writ at all times, and from all Courts: and if he had been able to justify himself by such Vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, this would have saved his own Reputation, tho the proofs I had given to the contrary, would have had still force enough to discredit his <hi>History</hi>: I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57150:14"/>
fancied at least that he would have cited some of <hi>Cardinal de Bellay's Letters</hi>: But I was surprised when I received his <hi>Answer,</hi> and saw, that instead of all these Authorities, of which he had boasted, that the only two <hi>Authors</hi> that he cites, are <hi>Florimond de Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and <hi>himself</hi>; the two worst Writers that he could find: if in his <hi>Preface</hi> he had owned that he had done nothing,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 265.</note> but <hi>copied Florimond de Raimond</hi>; that he was his <hi>Warrant</hi>;<note place="margin">283.</note> that his Testimony was the <hi>authentick Proof</hi> of what he affirmed;<note place="margin">323.</note> and that he himself was only <hi>Florimond de Raymond's Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>;<note place="margin">423.</note> if, I say, he had owned in his <hi>Preface</hi> all this, then I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that I had no reason to complain of him, since he justifies himself by so many Pages cited from that Author, that they make the half of his <hi>Answer</hi>; but since he pretends to write upon <hi>Original Papers,</hi> and yet does not cite any one, I leave it to all indifferent men to conclude, what account is to be hereafter made of all the <hi>Histories</hi> that either has come or can come from
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57150:14"/>
him: let him print his Vouchers, or at least, let him tell where they may be found; otherwise I will take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to tell him, that all his <hi>Histories</hi> are <hi>Romances,</hi> which he has drawn as to the matters of Fact out of the worst Authors, and the most decried of any that had writ in the last Age; and to which he adds a refining of Policy, such as his own Invention could furnish; so that without the least aggravation, I do affirm, that one may seek the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> or of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> in the Romances of <hi>Cassandra</hi> or <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> with as much assurance as the <hi>History of the Reformation</hi> in Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>: all the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and those Romantick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being, that they built indeed on good Authors, upon which they grafted their own fictions, yet in such a manner that no body could be deceived by them: whereas Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had founded his <hi>Romance</hi> on very bad Authors, and he delivers his Fictions with such an air of sincerity, as may very probably deceive those who believe too easily. So that I see nothing that is left for him, to preserve that small remnant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57150:15"/>
that it seems a <hi>Coquelin,</hi> or some few of <hi>his Friends,</hi> retain yet for him; but to own that he intended not to write <hi>true Histories,</hi> but only to amuse the World with a new sort of <hi>Nouvelles</hi>: in which the point at which he aimed, was not to tell truth; but that as the Writers of Plays or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, think the best way to work upon the passions, is to dress up known Storys with moving Circumstances, since men are not so apt to be affected when all is Fiction; so he fancied, that he could not raise a Rage against <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy,</hi> and an admiration of that conduct that has driven it out of <hi>France,</hi> by any other method so successfully, as by this that he has taken. If, I say, he will betake himself to this Defence. I will pursue him no further; but till he is so sincere as to confess his Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, I will take the pains yet once more to unmask him, and after I have laid him open for this <hi>Answer,</hi> as well as for the <hi>second Volum</hi> of his <hi>History,</hi> then I shall take leave of him: and will promise him, that for ought I know, I will never write more against him; for this one good reason, which is, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57150:15"/>
I will never read one word of his Writings any more; and now I doubt no but I shall make him to be so well known, that to turn his Approver in Mr. <hi>Coquelins</hi> words a little altered, <hi>His works will need no more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried; for the bare name of the Author will be beyond all that a can be said for their disparagement.</hi> I confess, I cannot imagin what a sort of a man Mr. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelin</hi> is, whose approbation accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies all Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s late Works; for it seems he cannot find another that is so complying, and therefore he does not change his man. I fancy Mr. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelin</hi> must be profoundly learned in the <hi>Oriental Tongues,</hi> or in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks</hi>; for these are the studies in the World, that are most opposite to that of <hi>History</hi>; therefore I conclude, that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> comes to him as to the person in the whole <hi>Sorbon,</hi> that is the most unacquainted with late Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions: and perhaps he finds him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving some Probleme, or reading some <hi>Arabick</hi> Manuscript; and as all men, tho addicted to one sort of study, yet are willing to be thought univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal; so no doubt Mr. <hi>Coquelin</hi> hopes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57150:16"/>
to pass for a good Judge in <hi>History,</hi> by approving Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s Books: but he will do better to go on in the course of his other studies, in which he may be very Eminent for ought I know; but I am sure he is a very ill Judge of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the last Age. I shall not take the pains to examin all that recital that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> makes of the <hi>Pensions</hi> that have been offered to him; and that have been refused by him. I will believe them all for once: and this is a great matter for me to do, since he himself is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Author of this piece of his own <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi>; for his Credit is not very authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical with me; but all that can be made out of this, is, that he had once gained some Reputation, as a man that had discovered many Secrets, and that had penetrated into many Intrigues; all which he has made a shift now to lose; for as long as he went about the <hi>Ruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> those things might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps pass with less exact Judges; but now that he will carry his Visions fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is not like to be solicited on all hands by the offers of <hi>Pensions</hi> any more: so he must now try to keep up the value of his Books; for the sale
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57150:16"/>
of them, being perhaps the only reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue that is left him; he must maintain their credit better than he has done, otherwise both they and he will sink in their price. It is not the Dedicating his Books to a great <hi>Monarch,</hi> that will support their Reputation. It seems he fancies, that those poor Flate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that he has offered up at that Altar, give him such a pretension to a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from thence, that he may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invite that <hi>Prince</hi> to be a Witness to this Dispute of his with me; not considering how much it is below the Sublimity of such a <hi>Monarch,</hi> to be appealed to on so mean an occasion: It is a forgetting the respect due to crowned Heads, to run to them with every trifle: but Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> will needs engage the <hi>King</hi> in the Quarrel, and represent himself as his Champion, not doubting but that this his Zeal for his Glory will receive some Eminent Reward; yet if the reward is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the service that is done, it will not go far: and as it seems the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi> have desired Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> not to meddle with the concerns of their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>; for they are too good Judges not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57150:17"/>
to know that the services of so decried an <hi>Author,</hi> are Injuries rather than Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; so it is not to be doubted, but those two Eminentmen, who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated their pens to their Princes Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, will be moved with a just In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation when they see how poorly it is defended by Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 20.</note> and that they will procure an Order, prohibiting him to medle with Subjects that are so far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him.</p>
                  <p>But it is very likely, that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution will be needless: and that he will quickly bring himself as low in the esteem of the World, as it seems he is high in his own. For not contended to tell the World, that <hi>he rises above the Vulgar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 26.</note> and that he has studied to imitate the Antients, leaving, as in a Region below him, such <hi>poor Writers as I am, to be reckoned among the Historians of the lower form,</hi> as if all this were too little, he will carry his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations further: and since this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Age does not pay him the esteem it owes him, he will make all that up in a most superlative value that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57150:17"/>
he puts on himself. He is not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to compare himself to <hi>Tacitus,</hi> but thinks <hi>the Characters that he gives are even Superiour to those of Tacitus.</hi> I will not disturb him in the peaceable possession of those good thoughts that he has of his own productions, in which I believe he has few rivals: but as for that small disposition that I once had to think well of them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 90.</note> with which he reproaches me sometimes, he has so fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me of my mistake,<note place="margin">433.</note> that he has quite cured me of it; I had softned a severe censure I put on his works, by saying, that <hi>his writings wanted none of the beauties of History, but that of truth</hi>; where the Incense that I gave in the former part of the Period, was intended to carry some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation to the sharpness of the latter part of it; but as one that is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love with himself, misrepresents even the reproofs given him, as if they had been praises; so he turns this as if I had said, <hi>that he wanted none of the qualities of a good Historian, without adding any expression of that of truth</hi>; yet because I confess my words
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57150:18"/>
gave some occasion to this mistake, and since I would not be willingly guilty of any thing that may encrease his distemper, I do now acknowledg, that I writ these words too carelesly, and that I shewed more good breeding than exactness in them. But to let him see how apt I am to confess my Faults, and to retract them, I do acknowledg that he has so fully convinced me of my error, that I am now like to fall into the other extream, and to allow him none of the <hi>beauties of History,</hi> unless it be a smooth way of telling his dreams; for there is as little judgment as there is truth in what he writes. I hope he is now satisfied with my sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in this confession; and to shew him how sensible I am of my former error, I shall take great care in all time coming, not to commend him beyond what I think is due to him, and then I am sure I shall be very sparing, and will praise his works as little as those learned men at <hi>Paris</hi> do, who begin now to speak out to the world that which they said to me in discourse, while I had the honour to see them. Mr. <hi>Hosier's</hi> Letter is no
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57150:18"/>
great sign of his admiring Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> as much as it seems he himself does; and tho I do not think fit to name the persons that gave me those ill impressions of his works,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 30.</note> for which he reproaches me, yet I do not doubt but some of them will name themselves too soon perhaps for his honour. A man is indeed tempted by the confidence with which Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi> proposes his Fictions to the world, to express his Indignation in terms that are perhaps sharper than is fitting: and this carried me into a smartness in my <hi>Reflections</hi> upon him, that had never appeared in any of my other writings: the Cause, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent conjuncture of Affairs, and the reputation that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had gained, seemed to require it: but now I do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him, that how much raillery or contempt soever he may find in my <hi>Reply</hi> to him, he shall meet with no mixture of anger. I must put a little salt and seasoning in a writing of this nature: for it is a dull business to go on in a Flat strain like his, and only to say <hi>this is False,</hi> and <hi>that is Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> and to sprinkle here and there a

course piece of raillery. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make my self and my Reader a little merry with him: for a very bad entertainment must be set off with guarnishings: And Mr. <hi>Varilla</hi>'s er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and his ignorance exposed to the world, would make but an ill <hi>Regale,</hi> if they were not quickned with a little humour.</p>
                  <p>A very short <hi>Answer</hi> carrys off all that is material in this Book; for the only Authority that is brought being <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond de Raymond</hi>; as soon as I have shewed how little credit is due to him, then the substance of his whole <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> is examined: he lived at <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> far from <hi>England,</hi> and from the knowledg of <hi>English Affairs</hi>: he had no sort of Instruction relating to our matters, but what he drew from <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> whose <hi>Eccho</hi> he was, as much as now Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is his. So that since <hi>Sanders</hi> was the <hi>Text</hi> upon which both he and all the other Writers of the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> had only enlarged, I had reason to conclude, that the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing <hi>Sander's</hi> credit, did at the same time refute all the other <hi>Authors</hi> that had copied him. And I had done
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57150:20"/>
this so effectually, that no man has since that time pretended to justify <hi>Sanders.</hi> I do not think every man is bound to read my Book; yet I may say,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 108.257.</note> that every man that goes to write upon those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is bound to read it, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to discover that the <hi>Authorities</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I have founded my <hi>History,</hi> are false, or to forsake those common Mistakes that Forreigners had taken up on <hi>Sander</hi>'s Authority. It is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for a man that has followed those Authors to say, <hi>that such a man had said those things before him</hi>; unless it appears, that the Voucher was both well informed, and that he was a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and dispassionate man. Now as <hi>Florimond de Raymond</hi> had no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Informations of our Affairs, so a man sees in every period of his <hi>History,</hi> so much of a malignant spirit against the <hi>Reformation,</hi> that this gives a just Prejudice against all that he says: and if I have proved beyond a possibility of Contradiction, that the relations that he gives must be false, they will not become true because a <hi>Florimond,</hi> or a <hi>Varillas</hi> from him, have affirmed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57150:21"/>
them. As for that part of <hi>Florimond</hi>'s <hi>History,</hi> which relates to the affairs of <hi>England,</hi> it is not so much as pretended to be writ by him: for the contrary is expresly intimated in the Preface, &amp; his <hi>Son</hi> seems to claim the praise of that to himself. But upon the whole matter, it is first very much doubted, whether he was at all the Author of those Books that passed under his name. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have said, that <hi>F. Richeome</hi> a <hi>Iesuite</hi> writ them, and borrowed the name of a Councellour of Parliament to give his work the more credit: perhaps it was thought necessary to set a Writer of some name in opposition to Mr. <hi>de Thou,</hi> whose <hi>History</hi> was writ with too much sincerity to be acceptable to that Order. <hi>Peter Mathieu</hi> in his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry says positively, that it was believed that <hi>F. Richeome</hi> was the Author of the Books that went under the name of <hi>Florimond de Raimond. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guier</hi> in his <hi>Theater of Antichrist,</hi> and <hi>Rivet</hi> in his <hi>Answer to the Iesuite,</hi> say the same thing: and these were men that writ soon after <hi>Florimond's</hi> Books appeared. <hi>Blondel</hi> was also of the same mind; and tho he aggreed with the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57150:21"/>
pretended <hi>Florimond</hi> concerning the Falsehood of the Story of <hi>Pope Ioan,</hi> upon which he had also writ a Book; yet he spends forty pages towards the end of his Book, to shew how poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Florimond</hi> had disproved it, and lays him open in a vast number of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that he had committed, of which some are extream absurd. It is true, some of the Writers of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have magnified him highly: a man that writ so passionatly for them, could not fail of this: so no wonder if <hi>Possevin</hi> and <hi>Gretzer</hi> cry him up: and we see by a Letter of <hi>Card. Baronius,</hi> (published by <hi>Mr. Colomies</hi>) writ to <hi>Florimond de Raimond,</hi> how highly he valued him, and that he looked on him as a most extraordinary person. But all this will not prevail much on those who knew the genius of those Writers, and how apt they were to magnify eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that was passionate in their cause. Yet these praises given him by stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, could not raise his reputation in <hi>France,</hi> where he never passed for a Writer of any note, either for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or sincerity: and he was as little esteemed in the quality of a Judge, as he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57150:22"/>
deserves to be for his writings; for the Character that was given of him, was no less severe than pleasant: <hi>Iudicat sine conscientia, libros scribit sine scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, &amp; aedificat sine pecunia: He judges without conscience, he writes Books without knowledge, and builds without money.</hi> And now this is the Hero of <hi>Mr. Varillas,</hi> upon whose Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he triumphs: and he who perhaps a year ago, would have resented it, as the greatest indignity that could have been done him, if it had been said, that he did nothing but <hi>copy</hi> such an Author, and that he was only his <hi>Eccho,</hi> is now glad to fly to so poor a shift; for which he is, as I hear, so much censured in <hi>Paris,</hi> that it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too great a cruelty in me to urge this matter too far. Yet <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> has a sublim tour in every thing, so that instead of setting before us the reasons that led him to depend upon such an Author, which might pass with the world, such, as that he was well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and that he was free of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: he gives one, which indeed no man besides himself would ever have thought on: he tells us, that <hi>he had
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57150:22"/>
a Wife and Children</hi>:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 157.</note> now it is not easy to find out the force of this Argument: but a man must rise above the Vulgar as much as <hi>Mr. Varillas,</hi> to comprehend his lofty strains. If to have Wife and Children makes a man a good Writer, one may conclude without any further enquiry, that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has neither. Here is also a new Argument for he <hi>Marriage of the Clergy,</hi> that has never been yet thought on, yet an ordinary capacity like mine, cannot comprehend why this should have made <hi>Florimond de Raimond</hi> a good Writer, and why it had not the same effect on <hi>Mr. de Thou.</hi> So I think I have said enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this <hi>Councellour</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and his Wife and Children.</p>
                  <p>There are two other general Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,<note place="margin">

thinks he argues strongly, when he says, <hi>I cannot shew him an Instance that the like ever fell out before</hi>: an Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is indeed a very good answer to all the Proofs that can be brought: and such are the evidences by which I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Calumnies thrown on <hi>Anne Bullen</hi>: but Improbabilities ought never to be set against Positive Proofs: for men are so apt to be guided by Humour and Caprice, and are sometimes so blinded by passion and Interest, that they do often depart from all the Rules both of Prudence and Decency: nor is it a Reason to be alledged by any, but Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> that such things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true, because I cannot shew the like instance in any other History. For supposing that were true, every Age, as it produces Originals, so affords new Subjects of Amasement: for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, it may seem incredible that a man could have writ so many <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>History</hi> as Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has done, in which he mentions nothing less than <hi>Letters, Instructions,</hi> and other <hi>Original Papers</hi>; and this in an Age in which men are not easy nor Implicit, but love to examin Matters, and that also upon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57150:24"/>
Subjects of <hi>Religion,</hi> in which it was probable, that some men might call him to an account; and that yet this man, when called to an account, should not cite one of all these <hi>Papers,</hi> but should build only on a doubted and despised <hi>Author</hi>: and that when he had reason to think, that this other Writings might be critically examined, he went on in the same careless and bold strain; a man may argue very strongly, that this cannot be true; and it is certain, that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> cannot give an Instance that the like ever fell out before; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, the thing is true; so that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabilities may be justly set against Probabilities; but they are unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly urged against Positive proofs. Truth is Truth still, tho it had never fallen out but once; as Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is an Original; for there was never an Author before him that carried on Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures in Matters of <hi>History</hi> so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently as he has done.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> cites likewise many pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages out of his other Books,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 27, 92, 225, 86, 244, 201, 374.</note> to shew that he was not ignorant of those things for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57150:25"/>
which I charge him, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what he has writ in his <hi>History of Heresies:</hi> but first, I do assure him, I have not read his other Books with so much exactness as to remember all that is in them. I was indeed at first sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised, with the many Discoveries that he seemed to make; but I very quickly made another Discovery, that destroyed them all: and found, that he was a Writer of <hi>Romances,</hi> and not of <hi>true Histories,</hi> unless it be in that sense in which <hi>Lucian</hi> uses that Title: so I am nothing concerned in his other <hi>Books,</hi> but intend only to destroy his Credit, which, I think my self as much obliged to do, as to discover a false <hi>Coyner:</hi> If he has writ differently in his other <hi>Books,</hi> from what he writes in this, I am not bound to receive or bear all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions: and from this very thing, by which he pretends to justify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he destroys his own Credit; for if he had writ upon good Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, all would have been Uniform: for Truth is ever the same, and does not change faces: but a man that writes his own Visions, cannot carry always along with him all his Dreams: and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57150:25"/>
therefore he fits them to the present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; so that his having reported them in another manner in some of his other <hi>Books,</hi> does not at all justify him, but gives a further discovery of his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Impostures.</p>
                  <p>I now come to a more particular Enquiry, and shall hereafter follow him more closely; but I will represent only the most Eminent of the Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies that are in his <hi>Book,</hi> and strike the Eye; for to search after all, were both endless and needless.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. He will needs justify his view of <hi>Heresy,</hi> delivered in a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick stile, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 44.</note> from <hi>Titus Livius</hi>'s beginning; who only tells what he intended to do himself: which any Writer besides Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> may very well do; for those who write upon true Information, know what they go about; but an <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Romances</hi> cannot so easily fore-tel this: I do not quarrel with him for telling what he intended to do himself, but for representing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of <hi>Heresy</hi> in a fore-telling stile. It seems his Acquaintance among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Authors</hi> is equal to his Knowledg of <hi>Manuscripts</hi>; otherwise he could
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57150:26"/>
have found others that had begun their Works as <hi>Livy</hi> does, without going so far down as to <hi>St. Ierome</hi>; and if that <hi>Father</hi> had not done the <hi>Church</hi> more service in writing on the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> than he did in the writing of <hi>Lives,</hi> his Authority would be as small as Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi> ought to be.</p>

with which he had honoured the Lord <hi>Darnley</hi>; in this I must refer my self to those who have the <hi>French</hi> Editions; but all who have read the Impression of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> see that he does me wrong in saying, that I have <hi>added</hi> it. No, I leave such practices to Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las.</hi> I have taken some pains to find a Book of the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition in this Countrey, but have not been able to do it: yet as for his Answer, and his second <hi>Volum,</hi> I have them before me of the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition, so there shall be no more room for any such Dispute for the future; but it is strange, that this word <hi>simple</hi> should have been soisted into the <hi>Dutch</hi> Impression, if it was not in the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition: words are left out, but seldom added in those Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that do only Copy another. The Series of the Narration makes me believe, that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> denies this, with the same sincerity that he affirms other things, why did he call him a <hi>Gentleman</hi> without adding any other Description of his Quality; for let him say what he will, of the Honour of that Title, yet all the world knows, that when a man is upon such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57150:27"/>
qualified barely as a <hi>Gentleman</hi>; that it is understood, that he has no higher rank, nor any particular distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and that which comes after this, <hi>that by this Marriage the Queen grew contemptible to all her Subjects</hi>; shews, that even tho <hi>Simple</hi> were not to be found in the <hi>Paris</hi> Editions, yet it must be understood. But because Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> will pretend to know the <hi>Scottish</hi> Story, he offers to recriminate. In short, those who sent him that Story of my life, have also furnished him with some. Errors for which he charges me in such heinous terms as to call them <hi>Faults of vast importance, which the meanest of all the little Schollars at</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh <hi>would have avoided.</hi> I ought to fall a trembling here; for I know there would be no quarter for me if I fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s hands: yet all these dreadful words come only to this, that she whom I called the Lord <hi>Darnley's Grandmother,</hi> proves to be his <hi>Great Grandmother</hi>; and that she whom I call <hi>Isabel,</hi> was <hi>Margaret.</hi> And are not these justly to be aggravated with such severity, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 222.</note> as to say, that these <hi>were Faults of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57150:27"/>
grossest sort, against the first Elements of the History of my Countrey.</hi> I forgive Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> for magnifying those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, since he can meet with no other: and I do not find my self a whit trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, if writing in <hi>Holland,</hi> where I had not the requisites of Books or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, I did not carry the race of the Family of <hi>Lennox</hi> so exactly in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, but that I might mistake so far as to call a <hi>Great Grandmother a Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother</hi>; and there having been a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Lady <hi>Isabel Dowglas,</hi> if I mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took <hi>Isabel</hi> for <hi>Margaret,</hi> this is no great matter. But he charges me with a third, because I said, that the <hi>Branch of the</hi> Lennox's <hi>came out of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the</hi> Stewards, <hi>before the Crown came into it by Marriage</hi>; whereas he tells me, I should have said <hi>at the same time,</hi> since the first of the Family of <hi>Lennox</hi> was Brother to him that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Heir of the Crown. If I had said, <hi>long before,</hi> he might have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged me for it; but the younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being born before that Marriage, and not being descended from it, I used all necessary caution in my words, my design being only to shew, that the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57150:28"/>
House of <hi>Lennox,</hi> by the Paternal descent, had no relation to the Crown: after this our Author, <note place="margin">

But Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi> ought to know, that the Dignity of the <hi>K.</hi> of <hi>England's</hi> birth is too great a thing to receive any addition by the Imployments that those of the Family of <hi>Lennox</hi> might have merited in <hi>France:</hi> So mean a man as Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> who has nothing in his thoughts but the smiles of <hi>Versailles,</hi> fancies he gives a lustre to one of the greatest <hi>Kings</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> when he says, that some of his Family served in <hi>France,</hi> which rather lessens his Race than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts it. As for his Impudence in putting the <hi>Crown of Scotland</hi> instead of the <hi>Crown of England,</hi> and his making me say, that the Lord <hi>Darnley</hi> might have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57150:28"/>
been a dangerous competitor to <hi>Mary Queen of Scots</hi> for that <hi>Crown,</hi> when not only my words, but the whole se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Discourse, shews, that I meant only of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> was already observed. It will indeed bear a repetition; for it is a remarkable instance of Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s sincerity, and shews how safely the world may rely on his word. He shews his Ignorance again in saying, <hi>That his Marriage of the Queen of</hi> Scotland, <hi>was the first cause of the change of Religion in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The change of Religion was made before the <hi>Queen</hi> came out of <hi>France,</hi> and so was setled some years before this Marriage; and this was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a step towards the subverting of the <hi>Religion</hi> then established, since the Lord <hi>Darnley</hi> lived and died a <hi>Roman Catholick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. What he says to shew, that the greatness of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> spirit does not contradict the character that He gives of her,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 60.</note> is so poor, that I will not examin it; the subject is too tender to admit of it, as well as what he says is too dull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57150:29"/>V. He gives a long Citation of his own words,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 67.</note> by which it does not appear that I supprest any thing that needed to be told by me; if this Book had been printed two years sooner than it was, I should have believed, that Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> was in Pension to some body else, than the <hi>King of England,</hi> by the pains he is at to justify the putting a <hi>Bastard</hi> into the Succession of the <hi>Crown</hi>: for I do not believe, that at this time any body thinks him considerable enough to be corrupted.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 73.</note> 2. His al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that I had accused him as if he had said, that the <hi>King</hi> had composed whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums on this subject, is another mark of his sincerity; for it is visible, I had said no such thing. 3. The Proofs he brings to justify what he had said of the baseness of the Race of the <hi>Tudors</hi> from some Strangers, and <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> one of the worst of our Writers, are not to be put in the ballance either with <hi>Polider Virgil</hi>'s Testimony, or the more Authentick Evidences that I had given, particularly in my <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,</hi> to which he says not a word.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57150:29"/>
4. There is a great difference between saying, that the <hi>Tudors</hi> were not Gentlemen, and the denying that he was a fit match for a <hi>Queen-Dowager.</hi> And tho Mr. <hi>de Courteney</hi> is perhaps of a higher degree of <hi>Nobility,</hi> than I pretend that the <hi>Tudors</hi> are, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he would be thought an unequal match to a Queen Dowager of <hi>France</hi>: so tho the <hi>Tudors</hi> might perhaps drive up their pedigree to <hi>Cadwaller,</hi> yet they had been for some Ages reckoned only as one of the best Families of <hi>W<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>les</hi>: and this puts an end to all that trifling of his, when he pretends to argue against his Birth, by saying, that if he was so descended, he was an equal Match to the <hi>Queen Dowager.</hi> 5. There might be very good reasons that might make the <hi>Queen</hi> conceal her Marriage all that was possible, even tho <hi>Tudor</hi> had been ever so good a Gentleman: for she being a <hi>Queen-mother,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a <hi>Son</hi> newly born, which gave the prospect of a long share in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, she had reason to hide her Marrying a Gentleman, had he been ever so nobly born. The <hi>Dowager</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> that was King <hi>Henry's Sister,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:57150:30"/>
had none of those considerations for hiding her Marriage with <hi>Brandon</hi>; and the other Sister the <hi>Queen Dowager</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had no reason at all to hide her Marriage; for she made it to secure her in the Government, <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> being then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Subject in the Nation: so the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Marriage with <hi>Tudor</hi> secret, does not at all prove that He was no Gentleman. 6. But Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> does not pretend to answer the main thing that I laid to his charge, which was, that he speaks of the <hi>Tudor</hi> that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Family of the <hi>Plantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> as a mean man, when he was the <hi>Kings</hi> uterine Brother; so that I shewed, that when he writ his History, he knew nothing of that Marriage, since it is not to be imagined, that any man who knew it could pretend to reckon up the Race of the <hi>Tudors,</hi> without mentioning its chief Dignity. 7. If I had thought so slight a fault, which Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> magnifies so much in me, of calling a <hi>Great-grand-mother</hi> a <hi>Grand-mother,</hi> worth mentioning, here I have proved him guilty of it; for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57150:30"/>
he calls the <hi>Tudor</hi> that married the <hi>Plantagenet,</hi> Great-grand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>father to King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 70.</note> whereas he was only his Grand-father. 8. He tells us in his Justifying the Succession of Bastards, that the Rank of the <hi>King's</hi> Bastard was much higher than <hi>Owen Tudors</hi> was; but tho the <hi>French</hi> have so far flattered the Lewdness of their <hi>Kings,</hi> as to esteem their Bastards <hi>Princes born,</hi> yet in <hi>England</hi> they have no Rank at all, till the <hi>King</hi> gives them a <hi>Title,</hi> and then their Rank is only according to the degree and the date of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. He confess here the very words that I cited out of him, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 84.</note> and yet he pretends, that I had accused him falsely. But that he may have some colour for this, he charges on me words that are not in my <hi>Reflections.</hi> He had said, <hi>The four principal Cantons had suffered themselves to be seduced in less than a year</hi>; whereas this was ten years work: and now he thinks to save this by saying, <hi>that a great part was abused
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57150:31"/>
in less than a year</hi>; but even this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed only to <hi>Zurich</hi>; whereas he had said, that the four <hi>Cantons</hi> suffered themselves to be seduced: besides that, what he speaks thus of the <hi>Cantons</hi> in general, cannot be meant of some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, but must be understood of the Magistracy; and yet now he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, that they were ten years a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering this matter before it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received by the Government, to whom only the name of the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> belongs: and as the Bigness of the Town of <hi>Basil</hi> does not hinder its being one of the little <hi>Cantons,</hi> so the pensions that <hi>France</hi> might pay an Age ago to <hi>Schaffhouse,</hi> will never change its rank among them: nor does he say a word to justify his Mustring up of the seven <hi>Popish Cantons</hi> among the small ones; or his raising <hi>Appensel</hi> and <hi>Glaris</hi> to be among the middlesised.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Here he remembers me of my Fault of having said, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 90.</note> 
                     <hi>That his way of writing wanted none of the Beauties of History, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of Truth</hi>; which he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats, according to his ordinary since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57150:31"/>
                     <hi>that I my self had avowed, that he wanted none of the Qualities proper for writing History</hi>; without putting in my exception <hi>of that of truth</hi>: that even by this citation he might justify my accusing him of <hi>want of truth</hi>: but he tells us, <hi>that by his Copyers fault his</hi> Preface <hi>to his third Book was lost; so he was forced to make that up the best he could</hi>; and then he comforts himself with his meditation, <hi>that the Books of Authors are subject to Fortune as well as other human things</hi>: but I was not bound to know the secrets that past between him and his Copyer, no more than I am bound now to believe what he says of it. The Books of Authors are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Fortune; for by a great chance his were once in some esteem; but as we say of the <hi>Dead,</hi> that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>reach of Fortune</hi>; so his Books very likely may be soon exempted from Fortune in that sense. In short, he seems to confess, that the Preamble he sets before <hi>Luthers</hi> affair is Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and I said no more of it.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. He gives me an Advice how I should have begun my Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:<note place="margin">

                     <hi>With the Indignation that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57150:32"/>
the English Nation had to the Papacy ever since King</hi> John <hi>had subjected his Crown to the Holy See, and had esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished the Peterpence, that this was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased because a Pope had made them lose</hi> Guienne, <hi>by binding one of their</hi> Kings <hi>to levy the tenths on the Church Lands: that King</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth's lewdness gave him a great byas to schism, which he pursues in a full career</hi>: and repeats those Absurd Calumnies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> which I had to copiously refuted: and at last he adds, That <hi>King</hi> Henry <hi>raised mean persons to great Imployments; that these by the Laws and Government of</hi> England, <hi>could not enrich themselves but moderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in many years; and therefore since they resolved they would be rich all of the sudden, they saw they must do it at the Churches cost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not wonder that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> should advise me to have made up a <hi>Preface</hi> in this manner, that so I might write in his own way; but I think I have sufficiently convinced him, that I have not such an esteem of him as to be much inclined to follow his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. 1. It was King <hi>Ina,</hi> and not King
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57150:32"/>
                     <hi>John,</hi> that setled the <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> 2. K. <hi>John's</hi> Action was a personal Baseness in him, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Polid. Virg. lib.</hi> 4.</note> which did not at all affect the Kingdom; so that there was scarce any notice taken of that meanness of his, unless it was to make him that was guilty of it contemptible; for <hi>a King of</hi> England <hi>can neither alienate nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his Crown to any forreign power.</hi> 3. What he says of <hi>Guienne</hi> seems to be one of his Discoveries; for it is not mentioned by any of our Historians, that I know of. 4. At the time that <hi>Guienne</hi> was lost, the <hi>Popes</hi> by resid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at <hi>Avignon,</hi> and being considered as in the power of <hi>France,</hi> had so little credit in <hi>England,</hi> that as there were many <hi>Laws</hi> made all that while against the <hi>Papal</hi> Pretensions, so a <hi>Bull</hi> at that time could not have been so much as executed in <hi>England,</hi> without the <hi>Kings</hi> leave, much less could it have obstructed the Subsidies levied upon the <hi>Clergy.</hi> 5. He understands the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of <hi>England</hi> as little as he does other things, that fancies the Nation was much troubled for the loss of <hi>Guienne</hi>: which lay at so great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57150:33"/>
and was defended at so vast a charge, that the Nation that received no profit by it, in an Age in which there was little trade, was glad of getting out of this necessity of giving the <hi>King</hi> so many Subsidies. If he had apply'd that which he says of <hi>Guienne</hi> to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> it had been more pertinent; but Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is as wanting in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he is fruitful in invention. 6. He ought not to awaken the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the pretensions that <hi>England</hi> has upon <hi>Guienne</hi>; for if the Rights of Crowns are so sacred, that no prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cuts them off, and that no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can alienate them, a time may come when a Chamber may be set up at <hi>Westminster,</hi> as well as we have seen one at <hi>Metz,</hi> to examine the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Guienne,</hi> which will be found less an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and better made out, than some that have been carried up to King <hi>Dagobert.</hi> 7. But I would gladly know what Law of <hi>England</hi> has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed the measure and the number of years in which the <hi>Kings Ministers</hi> may enrich themselves: but Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has found out Laws that we have not,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57150:33"/>
as he is ignorant of those we have: and now I think I have given him good Reasons, why I do not think fit to follow his Advice in the making of Prefaces.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. He is so much in love with his Maxim concerning <hi>the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to which he fancies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion carries men,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 102, 103.</note> 
                     <hi>in not suffering them to examin, whether what they say is true or false, that he repeats it twice so copiously, that he bestows ten lines upon it in every one of these two pages.</hi> 2. He cites a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Calvinist,</hi> that commended him for his sincerity in setting forth the handsome Actions of those of that party; and who owned, that he had not seen any of his side, commend those of the other party with the like since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but since I give so little credit to Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s Citations, even when he names all particulars, he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I will consider this much. 3. But what sincerity soever he might have affected in his History of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, which he did perhaps to gain him some Reputation, that he might be the less inspected in what should
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57150:34"/>
come afterwards, I am sure no <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist</hi> will make him great Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the future. 4. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s Defence of his Theory of the power of <hi>Religion</hi> is wonderful; he says, <hi>It seems I thought he meant only that true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had this power over the conscience; whereas he is convinced by experience, that false Religions have as much power over mens minds as the true has.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> were not of so singular a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position as he is, the excuse that he ought to have made, was, that he only meant of <hi>false Religions,</hi> or of mens Perswasions in matters of Religion: but to say that Religion does this, and now to own so plainly that the <hi>true Religion</hi> does it as well as false ones, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression that is so contrary to all <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> that I do not see how Mr. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelin</hi> can answer to the <hi>Faculty</hi> for his licensing such a Book: for tho the good man is utterly unacquainted with <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical</hi> matters, yet he seems to have read <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and he ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand a little <hi>Divinity</hi>: now tho his competence in that is probably very small, as appears by his way of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, yet even the Catechism will
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57150:34"/>
inform him, that true <hi>Religion</hi> instead of making us unconcerned in what we write, whether it is true or false, binds us to the greatest strictness of Truth. 5. His second Excuse is of the same force: He says, <hi>that according to the Principles of the</hi> Catholick Religion, <hi>after the Authority of the Church is once interposed, there is no need of any ones troubling himself, whether what She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees is true or false, since the Decision must certainly be true.</hi> But the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that led Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> to deliver this wonderful Apothegme, was concerning Historical Matters of Fact, in which Points of Doctrine are not concerned, except he will conclude, that when one is assured in Matters of Doctrine, he may support them with lyes, which he has indeed taken care to do, even to a degree of Supererogation: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, it is to be reckoned among the Sublimes of Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses the assurance of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> by saying, that <hi>one does not trouble himself, to examin whether what She decrees is true or false.</hi> If then this is the sense of his words, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belong to those Religions, that do
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57150:35"/>
not own that <hi>Infallibility</hi>; so that in short, the Priviledge of not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>whether what one says is true or false,</hi> belongs only to <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi>; in which we have no reason to pretend to a share. And if this is the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Catholcisk,</hi> Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> must be concluded the <hi>truest Catholick</hi> in the world; so never man used it in its full extent as he has done.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. What he says of <hi>my History's being so partial</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 109.</note>, is a Reproach that he does not confirm by any one Instance; and I hope he does not expect that I will believe this upon his word. He says, <hi>if Mr.</hi> Maimbourg <hi>had lived five or six mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, he had finished his confutation of my Book</hi>: But if it was so near being compleated, I wonder that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> could not hear of any one of my many Errors, which had been a more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant thing, than the putting a <hi>Grand-mother</hi> for a <hi>Great Grand-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or an <hi>Isabel</hi> for a <hi>Margaret.</hi> He also tells me, <hi>that it will not be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to prove, either that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that I have printed, are not true, or that the Copies of some of them that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57150:35"/>
are in the Kings Library, are defective.</hi> This last is so important to me, that the very apprehensions of the Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry should make me dye of fear. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has no Friends that review what he writes, otherwise tho he himself is very capable of writing extravagantly, yet they could not let such things pass; for it seems Mr. <hi>Coque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> Judgment is of the same sise with his own.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. He threatens me again <hi>with a Conviction that shall be stronger than I look for.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 115.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confess, if any thing that is <hi>strong</hi>; comes from his Pen, it will be <hi>stronger</hi> than I look for. But some one Instance had been <hi>stronger</hi> than so many Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: but he added here a little sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of sincerity; for he confesses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously, that tho he read all the <hi>Kings Manuscripts</hi> that were then in the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s hands, and were communicated to him by the late Mr. <hi>de Bethune,</hi> yet he has drawn no part of his History out of them, but out of the Authors that he has cited, and is to cite in this Answer. I assure him, I believe one part of this Period,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57150:36"/>
that for all his pretending to have founded his History on Cardinal <hi>de Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay's</hi> Letters, he has drawn nothing of it out of good Papers: for then it would have been quite different from what it is: but I do not believe that he read them all over; for how weak soever he may be, yet his weakness cannot go so far as to make him fancy that a <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was a better <hi>Warrant</hi> for his <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> than Original Papers.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> will still pretend to build on <hi>Cardinal de Bellay's</hi> Letters<note place="margin">

Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had done well to have named the first Negotiation of <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal de Bellay</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; for the Books that he cites mention but one. 2. The breach that the <hi>King</hi> made with the <hi>Pope,</hi> being only founded on the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,</hi> it cannot be said that this Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation did not relate to it. 3. I refer the <hi>Readers</hi> to his <hi>Preface,</hi> if they will be at the pains to take so ill a Book any more in their hands, there they will find that he makes <hi>Cardinal de Bellay's</hi> Letters the Text of all that he writ of <hi>English Affairs.</hi> 4. If that Discourse of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> of the Dangers he might run of Rebellions and Assassinations, be all contained in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57150:37"/>
one single Letter. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had obliged the Publick more by printing it, than by all the rest of this Book. 5. If King <hi>Henry</hi> apprehended this, the more shame for that <hi>Church,</hi> that has authorised such Doctrines, and such Practices: and in which a <hi>Pope</hi> made a Panegyrick on one Assassinate, <hi>Clement,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Iesuites</hi> have <hi>Besainted</hi> another, <hi>Garnet.</hi> 6. If Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> intends to justify <hi>Queen Elisabeth's</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to the <hi>Queen of Scots,</hi> he does very pertinently to alledge this: for as Self-preservation works strongly on all men, so it ought to make a greater Impression on <hi>Princes,</hi> whose Live are of greater consequence, and more in danger: and if <hi>Queen Elisabeth</hi> had reason to say, <hi>That either the one or the other must perish,</hi> no body will wonder if she chose to let the fate fall on the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi>: for in such an alternative, one would not lose much time in the deliberation. 7. As for his threatning me, it is known, that is the language of Cowards: I am not affraid of him, and I do not apprehend that he has so much tenderness for me, or that he thinks himself so much
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57150:37"/>
obliged to me, that he would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit my <hi>History,</hi> as much as I have done his, if he but knew how to go about it.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. He assures me, <hi>He has read</hi> Camdem <hi>exactly, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses his citing him as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian of the Revolution of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 120.</note> 
                     <hi>only in the singular</hi>; and confesses, <hi>if he had said it in the plural number, Revolutions, I had some reason for my Censure; so since he writ of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under Queen</hi> Elisabeth, <hi>this justifies him. He denys that</hi> Camdem <hi>troubled Mr.</hi> de Thou, <hi>with the Manuscript of the second part of his History; which was an Imployment below a President</hi> de Mortier <hi>to be concerned in</hi>: and he adds, <hi>that he has often heard that</hi> Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem <hi>sent his Manuscript to Mr.</hi> du Puy, <hi>who took care to print it:</hi> and then he reflects on Mr. <hi>de Thou's</hi> partiality in all those matters, that related to the <hi>Queen of Scots,</hi> and says, <hi>that King</hi> James <hi>spake so severely to his Son upon it, that it threw him into a sickness of three moneths continuance:</hi> and in conclusion, he thinks I contradict my self, having said, <hi>that he had not read a Paege in</hi> Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57150:38"/>
                     <hi>and yet adding, that he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with him for his having discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so many Rebellions and Conspiracies against Queen</hi> Elisabeth; <hi>for how could he know this is he had not read him</hi>?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I do not know why Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> calls <hi>Camden</hi> always <hi>Camdem</hi>; this tempts me still to think, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw his Book; for when men hear names only mentioned in discourse, they are apt to Mistake them; but when they see them before them in print, they write them truer. 2. When Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> set a <hi>Preface</hi> before his first <hi>Volum,</hi> and mentioned a <hi>Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>England</hi> in it, that must be understood of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comprehended within the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, and not of one that does not come in but in the third Volum: so the Revolution made by King <hi>Henry,</hi> being all that was comprehended in that Volum, I had reason to say, he had never opened <hi>Camden,</hi> since he cites him as having writ concerning it. 3. He obliges me here to tell the Story of <hi>Camdens Manuscript</hi> more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly than I had thought necessary.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57150:38"/>
Mr. <hi>de Thou</hi> having intended to make his History general, entred into a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with the men over all <hi>Europe,</hi> that were most likely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him right: so he was in a great Correspondence with <hi>Camden</hi>: and when <hi>Camdens</hi> first <hi>Volum</hi> appeared, he writ severely to him, finding that it was so different from what had past between them in Letters, chiefly with Relation to the <hi>Queen of Scots</hi>; upon which <hi>Camden</hi> told him the truth, that King <hi>Iames</hi> would needs revise it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and afterwards put it in the Earl of <hi>Northampton's</hi> hands, who was Brother to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> that had been beheaded on that <hi>Queens</hi> account, and that many things were struck out, and many things altered: this troubled <hi>Camden</hi> extreamly, who took care, that his second <hi>Part</hi> should not run the same fate: and therefore he sent it out of <hi>England,</hi> to that <hi>Great Man,</hi> that it might be printed faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully after his death: This is well-known in <hi>England,</hi> and the sending the <hi>Second Part</hi> beyond Sea to a forreigner, does very easily carry a man to believe this to have been the true Reason of it.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57150:39"/>
4. I do not indeed think that a <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent de Mortier</hi> went to the <hi>Cramoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy's</hi> and the <hi>Barbin's</hi> of that time, to sell the Manuscripts, or to correct the Impression: and if so worthy and so learned a man as Mr. <hi>du Puy</hi> took care to see it faithfully printed, Mr. <hi>de Thou,</hi> as he did nothing unworthy of his dignity in being the Depositary of so valuable a piece of <hi>History,</hi> so he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the sacredness of the trust to the full, when he put it in his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hands. 5. It is true, that King <hi>Iames</hi> reproached Mr. <hi>de Thou's Son</hi> for his Father's having copied <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan's</hi> invectives against his <hi>Mother</hi>; but Mr. <hi>de Thou</hi> had a very tender heart, if this gave him a sickness of three moneths. 6. It is no contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for me to say, <hi>that he never read</hi> Camden; and yet to add, <hi>that he disliked him for the Discoveries he had made</hi>; unless Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> will prove, that it was impossible for him to know this by hear-say: now I, that tell him so oft, and which is worse, that prove that he writes upon hear-say, might well say that he had condemned <hi>Camden,</hi> tho he had never read a word in him,
<pb facs="tcp:57150:39"/>
as there are now a great many that think very ill of Mr. <hi>Varillas's Histories,</hi> and yet are resolved never to be at the pains to read a Page in him.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. He excuses himself for what he had said concerning <hi>Mortons Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> by telling us, that Mr. de la Vallade,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 127.</note> 
                     <hi>a Gentleman of</hi> Poictou, <hi>that was of the Religion, shewed him the Latin Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of a History, that he said was</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, <hi>which he intended to print; this</hi> he says, <hi>he read, and drew Extracts out of it:</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> here speaks modestly, and says, <hi>that Manuscript did not at all relate to the times that fall within the two first Volums; and that he will strike out of what Remains any thing that is drawn out of that Book, if he is informed by his Friends in</hi> England, <hi>that he has been deceived in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have already so oft told Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> that I will take nothing on his word, that I grow weary of repeating it. 2. If this History did not relate to the two first <hi>Volums,</hi> why did he speak of it in his <hi>Preface</hi> to the first? 3. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he needs not take great care of the <hi>Volums</hi> that remain; for I suppose,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57150:40"/>
the world will be at last convinced.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. He excuses that which he had said of <hi>Sanders</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 130.</note>, whom he had brought in as one of the Authors of our <hi>History,</hi> and of whom he had said, <hi>that he was so violent against the</hi> Protestants, <hi>that no wonder if they forced him to dye of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the Mountains of the North of</hi> England. He pretends, that by calling him <hi>Violent, he did not intend to reflect on his History:</hi> But since he brings him in as a Historian, this Character must be applied to his Book: and as he makes no Excuse for his having said, that he <hi>died in England,</hi> whereas it was in <hi>Ireland</hi>; so his representing the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity under which he fell, as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his <hi>Emportments,</hi> is a very soft way of speaking, of one that had raised a Rebellion, and that upon its miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage had fled into Woods, where he died of hunger; but this agrees well enough with his notion of <hi>Zealous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. What he says of <hi>Ribadeneira,</hi> is still so trifling<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 134.</note>, that I will not dwell on the examining of it: the severest things that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57150:40"/>
he could say against <hi>England,</hi> must have recommended him and his Books so much the more to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, who considered <hi>Queen Elisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> as the greatest Enemy he had: so I could not imagin what the Severity of the <hi>Inquisition</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's strictness as to the printing of Books had to do here: and there were no false steps of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifths to be related; for he adhered firmly both to his <hi>Aunt's</hi> Interests, and to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in this matter, and his setting on with much vigour the giving Sentence at <hi>Rome,</hi> would have appeared rather as a raising, than as a darkning of his Glory.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. He tells me, <hi>That what is printed of</hi> Lesley's <hi>Works, is not the tenth part of his Works</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 137.</note> 
                     <hi>which are preserved with great care in</hi> Paris, <hi>in the</hi> Scottish Colledge. This is like the rest of Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s Citations. It is 23. years since I took some care to be informed by the <hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Colledge, <hi>F. Barclay,</hi> if there were any <hi>Scottish</hi> Manuscripts saved in the time of the <hi>Reformation</hi>; he told me, <hi>they had none</hi>; but they believed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57150:41"/>
there were some in <hi>Italy</hi>: since that time there has been pains enough ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to enquire after those grounds, upon which <hi>Dempster</hi> had promised so great a Work: but it seems he was a Writer like Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>: for it could never be known out of what Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions he intended to draw those things that he promises concerning <hi>Scotland</hi>: and some have been so severe to him as to think, that he made all that pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous <hi>Apparatus,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> makes his <hi>Histories,</hi> out of his own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In short, <hi>Lesley's</hi> Book has been so well received of all hands, and is so much esteemed, that it will not be easy to persuade any, that a Colledge of <hi>Scottish Priests,</hi> would have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the <hi>Manuscripts</hi> of so good an Author, to lye above a hundred years in the dust.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. He charges me with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, for saying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 139.</note>, <hi>That there were some of Cardinal</hi> Bellay's <hi>Letters in the Kings Library, that were not yet printed:</hi> and yet adding in another place, <hi>That I know no other of his Letters besides those that are printed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:57150:41"/>But he must have made as great Discoveries in Logick, as he pretends to do in History, before he can make a Contradiction out of these two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions: <hi>Some told me there were some of that Cardinals Letters in the Kings Library besides those that were printed, and that I knew of no others besides those that are printed.</hi> For I do not pretend to have searched the Kings Library: yet after all, I had said no such thing; for I only said, <hi>that none of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, mentioned by Mr.</hi> Varillas, <hi>are in the printed Volum of that Cardinals Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> without adding, <hi>whether I knew of any other, or not</hi>: tho it is very true, that I know of no other. If I have put him oftner than once in mind of his Boldness, in pretending to draw his History out of <hi>Cardinal de Bellay's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>: I do not wonder to see him trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it, since he cannot justify any one tittle of his History out of them: the thing was so important, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be often repeated, and I used him gently in speaking of it so sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. <hi>He excuses his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</hi>

of Guichardin.</hi> But as there is no part of History more Instructing than that of the Cabinet, so a man like <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardin,</hi> that knew those secrets, and had a share in Affairs, obliged the World as much in delivering those so judiciously, as he did, tho perhaps a little too tediously, as Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has abused it, by so much counterfeit stuff, as he has given out instead of true Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks. But Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> tells me a dreadful thing upon this, <hi>That then his Friends are not clear sighted, since they have assured him, that this was that which they found to be the least amiss in his Books.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> writes long at this rate, I shall come to believe, that he has no Friends at all; and if he have any, it seems they are chosen according to <hi>Martials</hi> character (<hi>pares amici</hi>) men of his own sise; so that I do not now wonder if Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has been able to find a <hi>Coquelin,</hi> and a few more as ignorant as himself, who may perhaps admire him; yet he says in one thing true, that this is the part of his Books, <hi>that is the least amiss</hi>; and indeed this is all the praise that can belong to any part of his Books: for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57150:42"/>
tho all that is in them, is <hi>amiss</hi>; yet some parts are <hi>less amiss</hi> than others. And is roving about Political pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, are certainly <hi>less amiss</hi> than his plain and impudent Falsehoods.</p>
                  <p n="20">XX. I had accused Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> for saying, that all <hi>England,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excepting <hi>any one person,</hi>

                        <hi>P.</hi> 144.</note> professed the same <hi>Religion</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh: and I shewed him, that the putting this so general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly must be false, since in the second year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's reign there were a great many condemned of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy</hi>: he pretends to excuse this since the <hi>Spaniards</hi> boast that <hi>Heresy</hi> never past the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> tho many have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the <hi>Inquisition</hi> for it. But if any <hi>Spaniard</hi> had said, that there was never so much as <hi>one Heretick</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> I should have told him that he did not write exactly; and because I press this no further, than to shew by it, that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is a careless Writer, and am willing to let it pass with a gentle censure, because I had greater things to lay to his charge, he, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his usual sincerity, pretends, that I acknowledged the weakness
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57150:43"/>
of the Objection, and abandoned it.</p>
                  <p n="21">XXI. He pretends, that I accuse him falsly for denying the consummation of <hi>P. Arthur</hi>'s Marriage:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 151</note> whereas he says, he determined nothing positively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>P. Arthur's Impotence.</hi> But that was never the Question; for it was never brought under debate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was impotent or not: and that for which I had chiefly accused Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> was, that he affirmed, that <hi>P. Arthur</hi> was then <hi>sick,</hi> and not yet recovered out of a great disease: this is all Fiction, and is disproved by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses upon Oath; but he says not a word to justify this. 2. Here the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to tell at what pains he was, to examin the Affairs of <hi>England,</hi> that he thought the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> of both Religions might be too partial; that the <hi>Italians</hi> were too short; that <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> might be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted because of his Orders; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought <hi>Florimond de Raimond</hi> the best Author to depend upon: But if he had read <hi>Sanders</hi> alone, he would have found that both his <hi>Florimond</hi> and his <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> was nothing but <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>

over and over again. 3. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses me for making him say, that <hi>P. Arthur</hi> died <hi>Seven</hi> moneths after the Marriage, whereas he had said <hi>Five</hi> moneths. But in my <hi>English</hi> it was <hi>five</hi> moneths: so he has no reason to blame me for this, since I am not bound to answer for a <hi>Translation</hi>; and tho this was a good and exact Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which my meaning was not mistaken, as it has been too often in a Translation of a late Book of my <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> concerning <hi>Italy,</hi> yet so small a mistake was no great matter: and in a thing of this nature, Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> ought to have got some who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>English,</hi> to examin my Book in the Language in which I writ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had aecused me of having put <hi>seven</hi> for <hi>five on design to deceive my Readers.</hi>

He justifyes his false Citation of the <hi>Bull,</hi> by the most exact of all those who have continued <hi>Baronius,</hi> in whom the words he had cited are to be found. But why then did <hi>he</hi> cite the third Tome of the <hi>Bullarium</hi> on his Margin, and why did he not name this Writer, and the place of his Book: for such a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57150:44"/>
way of citing, especially in Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas,</hi> is very suspicious; and if that Author does not set down the <hi>Bull</hi> it self, but only delivers these words as his sense of them, then this was like the rest of Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s Citations, to give this on the Margin as drawn out of the <hi>Bull.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> He pretends that there is no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difference between his Citation and mine: But as it was enough for me to shew, that the words he cited were not in the <hi>Bull,</hi> so tho Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi> boasts in another place how much he has studied the Law, yet I must take the Liberty to tell him, that he has lost his time extreamly, while he pursued that Study; if he does not know a difference between a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory Clause, which may have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with less observation, and what is set forth in a Preamble, which being the ground upon which the grace is granted, and set at the head of the <hi>Bull,</hi> is of much more importance, and was probably much better consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, than any general Clause.</p>
                  <p n="22">XXII. He accuses me for having said, <hi>That</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated

                     <hi>who knew only Latin, and some general Elements of Learning</hi>; and tells me, <hi>how learned King</hi> Henry <hi>was.</hi> It appears by my words, that I spake only of his first Education, and not of the Improvements that followed. 2. He seems mightily concerned for the Memory of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, as if by this affected Zeal he would make some reparations to the Royal Family, for the Injuries he has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to do them: but I will be so plain as to tell him roundly, that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Seventh weakned the Rights of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> more than any that ever reigned in it: He knew that he could not found his <hi>Title</hi> on his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent from the House of <hi>Lancaster</hi>; for then he could never have been more than <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> since his <hi>Mother,</hi> by whom he had that pretension, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived him a year: and he would not hold the <hi>Crown</hi> by his <hi>Queens Title</hi>; for then the Right must have been in her, and have passed from her to her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren upon her death, or to her <hi>Sister,</hi> if she hapned to dye without issue: therefore he who would not hold the

                     <hi>Crown</hi> upon such a doubtful tenure, made that dangerous Law, that <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is in possession of the Crown, is to be acknowledged as the Legal King.</hi> And if King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh had been so Wife a King as some Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers have made him, he would never have suffered the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> to have fallen in to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> it having been always consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the preserving that in a separated <hi>Principality,</hi> was one of the most indispensible Maxims of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Policy: yet he, tho he made use of this as a pretence to ask <hi>Money</hi> of his <hi>Parliament,</hi> to oppose it, no sooner had the Money, than he gave way to it; for which it was believed, that he had Money from <hi>France.</hi> 3.

of which I could convince Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> by his own <hi>Anecdotes</hi>; if I were not ashamed to cite so bad an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
                  <p n="23">XXIII. He reproaches me <hi>for my insupportable Ignorance in not knowing the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Council and the Parliament of</hi> England,<note place="margin">

He affirms here, <hi>that the Council of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland

                     <hi>knew that care was taken that the Marriage with</hi> P.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57150:46"/>
their Process was made, and they were soon after executed. So certain it is, that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> read no Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that Reign. 2. He excuses the Impertinence with which I had taxed him, in calling <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth <hi>Duke of York</hi> after his Brothers death, by saying, he did it to avoid a <hi>Galima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias,</hi> which he thinks had followed, if he had called both the <hi>Brothers Princes</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi>; but having once shewed, that by the death of the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> the <hi>Younger</hi> became <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> this had been no more a <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathias,</hi> than to call any <hi>Successor</hi> to a Crown <hi>the King,</hi> which will create no confusion in the Readers mind; or if he was too tender in this point, he might have distinguished them by their names of <hi>Arthur</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> which was both clearer and shorter.</p>
                  <p n="25">XXV. He excuses himself here, and says, he drew from a <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the <hi>Catholick King's,</hi>

for writing out of good Memoirs, but for forging false ones. 2.

His spending two pages in repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over again that for which I had charged him, as if he had read it in a Letter of the <hi>Catholick King's,</hi> does not make any man believe this a whit the better. If he had told where that <hi>Letter</hi> was to be found, what the date of it was, and to whom it was writ; and if he had given it in the Language in which it was writ originally, then this might have had some appearance of a Proof: but he had several very weighty Reasons, that kept him from doing this; and he hoped that as Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Impudence was the shortest way, so it would be the surest to make him be believed.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 180</note>. 4. He goes on to justify that <hi>of</hi> Henry <hi>the Sevenths power to alienate the Crown of</hi> England, by saying, <hi>that he was a Conquerour, and was the Master of the Kingdom, as much as</hi> William <hi>the Conquerour was: and so he might dispose of it as he pleased.</hi> This is a new Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57150:47"/>
of Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s, that one who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be the right Heir, and is so happy as to defeat an Usurper, is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that to be accounted a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: for this was the case both of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> and of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh: the one pretended a Title from <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated <hi>Harold,</hi> as the other did derive a Title from the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and defeated <hi>Richard</hi>; but neither the one nor the other pretended that the Nation was a Conquest, no more than <hi>Henry</hi> the Ninth of <hi>France</hi> did when he broke the League. 5. He says, I need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not tell him that K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chused rather to hold the <hi>Crown</hi> by his Marriage with the Heir of the House of <hi>York,</hi> than by his right of Conquest. I told him no such thing, for I know it is false; since for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that I formerly named, he would never consent to hold the Crown in his Wife's Right. 6. He pretends, that I am banished <hi>England,</hi> for having been in the design of the <hi>Exclusion</hi> of the present <hi>King.</hi> All this is equally false: that I was in that design, that I was banished the Nation, and that it was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57150:48"/>
on that account: so his Sentence set in Capitals, is only a more evident dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery that he makes of himself, which he has done indeed in Capital Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p n="26">XXVI. He had said somewhat to purpose upon the Article of P. <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth, <note place="margin">

Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had not said, as he would have it pais now, that <hi>Ferdinand only pretended to give his Daughter to the Duke of Calabria,</hi> but he had affirmed positively, <hi>that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it:</hi> and yet all the proof he brings for this, is, <hi>that there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience in thinking, that at some time or other of his life, he might have been touched with the Remorse of the Injustice he had done the Duke of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria.</p>

                  <p n="29">XXVIII. He pretends that I had denied, <hi>that</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighths Parents thought of Marrying him to</hi> Francis <hi>the Firsts Sister</hi>:<note place="margin">

He tells me, <hi>that</hi> Lewis <hi>the twelfth never intended to cut off his Cousin</hi> Francis'<hi>s Right of Succession; and that his Sister was of a Rank fit to be a Match to the Heir of the Crown of</hi> England; <hi>and that the Duke of</hi> Lorrain <hi>married one, that was many degrees fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Crown than</hi> Margaret <hi>of</hi> Valois <hi>was.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now are not all these good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Proofs, and as he calls them, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 193.</note> Discoveries of Errors, that are insupportable in me? I never deny'd that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Parents would not think of this; but I lookt upon the whole thing as a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. 2. If it was ordinary in those days to contract Children, does that prove that this Proposition was ever made? 3. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s new discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys in Logick makes him now a second time, offer to prove a thing, because it was not <hi>Inconvenient.</hi> 4. It is no proof that Mr. <hi>de Piennes</hi> writ a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Embassy, because some others writ their own Memoirs, and this was the thing in question; so he should have justified that Citation. 5. There is a great difference between
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57150:49"/>
the not cutting off of <hi>Francis</hi>'s Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and the raising his Interest, by giving him so powerful an Ally. In short, I denied the Fact, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of proving it, tells me, <hi>it was not inconvenient, nor a Match below Henry,</hi> which I had never pretended.</p>
                  <p n="29">XXIX. He tells mighty things of his performances with Relation to <hi>England,</hi> and says, it is but too well known how it comes <note place="margin">

                        <hi>P.</hi> 200.</note> 
                     <hi>that I have cited any passage of his Book in which he had raised the power of the Parliament above the King's.</hi> Tho I told him, that in this very place he had said, <hi>that the Parliament being careful to maintain the Authority which they had over the King, obliged him by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Remonstrances to marry.</hi> 3. But if he has said it, he will make it good: and he tells me, that he will cite two Authorities for this, which I <hi>dare not contradict</hi>: the one is of King <hi>Iames</hi> the First, who in his <hi>Advice to this Son,</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:57150:50"/>
says, <hi>That the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>had not always kept its power within its due Limits, but had often enlarged it to the prejudice of the Royal Authority</hi>; to this he adds another long Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his, that filled a Page indeed, but had not one word to prove a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority in the <hi>Parliament</hi> to the <hi>King:</hi> on the contrary, it proves that it was a <hi>Court</hi> assembled by the <hi>King</hi> for the great Affairs of the <hi>Kingdom</hi>: now tho I will not presume to dispute this Authority, yet I will take the Liberty to tell Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> that it makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; for if <hi>Parliaments have sometimes gone beyond their Limits, and have carried their power to the prejudice of the</hi> Kings <hi>Authority</hi>; then by our <hi>Laws</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> is not Superiour to the <hi>King,</hi> but has its Limits, and it exceeds those Limits when it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to raise it self above the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power. 4. His second Authority is taken from an <hi>Italian</hi> of <hi>Bologna,</hi> and he sets down in Capitals his words, whereas ordinary Letters served for the Citation of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s words; but he thought the one did him not such service as the other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57150:50"/>
he bestowed the Capitals in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to him, that did him the best service. The Writer of <hi>Bologna</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed does say, <hi>That the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>has pretended a great Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity above the King of England.</hi> As for this Author Count <hi>Majolino Bisaccioni,</hi> I know nothing of him; so whether this is one of Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s Inventions or not, I will not determin: but I cannot imagin why this should be such an Authority that I <hi>dare not dispute it</hi>: It is true, the Author is of <hi>Bologna,</hi> where men are easily assassinated; yet I do not think, that this <hi>Count</hi> or his Heirs are so spiteful, as to send one to the <hi>City of Holland,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s Geography, to Murder me, if I <hi>contradict</hi> this Authority; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, I cannot imagin, what should make me not <hi>dare</hi> to <hi>dispute the Authority</hi> of one of <hi>Bologna,</hi> in a matter relating to the Government of <hi>England.</hi> But after the pains our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has been at to depress the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the Capitals that he has bestowed upon it, I confess he needs no more deny that he pretends to a Pension from thence.

5. In conclusion, he cites his <hi>Florimond,</hi> tho he had the confidence to cite on the Margin the Articles of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 1509. but now he runs to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; but tho he has done himself the Honour as to say, he is his <hi>Eccho,</hi> yet I never heard of <hi>Eccho</hi>'s that repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more than had been said: some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat over and over again, but none add: yet Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> who cited <hi>Florimond,</hi> to prove that the <hi>Parliament</hi> had obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>King</hi> by reiterated Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances, to marry the <hi>Infanta,</hi> finds neither these <hi>Remonstrances</hi> nor the <hi>Parliament</hi> in the Citation that he gives us out of him: for he says only, <hi>that the Princes, the Lords, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and the People of</hi> England, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of it by their consent, and made no Opposition to it.</hi>

Whereas I had discovered his Ignorance of those Transactions by this; that he knew nothing of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth's coming to <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Person,</hi> to contract this Marriage; he tells me, that he had writ of this in his History of <hi>Francis</hi> the first, where he had mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his coming over from <hi>Flushing</hi> to <hi>Kent,</hi> while K. <hi>Henry</hi> was at <hi>Calais</hi>: but now I tell him plainly, that I see by his Citation, that neither before nor now, does he know any thing of the Voyage into <hi>England,</hi> of which I had made mention: for this that he speaks of here was in the year 1520. and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview was at <hi>Dover,</hi> and was design'd to hinder the ill effects which the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> apprehended from the late enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view that had passed between <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> that had carried him over to <hi>Calais</hi>: But that which I spake of was two years after this, in the year 1522. which passed with more Magnificence; for then the <hi>Emperour</hi> was Install'd <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Garter,</hi> and contracted to King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Daughter.</p>

that subject; but Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> takes more care of <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfths honour in not printing it, than he does of his own.

which of them should have her; it was easy for him to observe both these Treatys, by declaring that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> should marry <hi>Henry</hi>'s Daughter: and here our Author shews his Judgment in setting such Conjectures as his are, against mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters so Authentically proved as this is.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57150:59"/>
and makes a War against him to be more meritorious than against Infidels. I had said, that the Calumnies, by which <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed not being objected to her,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 295.</note>, upon her fall, this shews, that they were not thought on in that Age: to this he answers, <hi>That this shews the Moderation of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>; but the not mentioning such things in History, had been a <hi>vicious Moderation,</hi> and indeed their Writers of that Age, were as seldom guilty of any excess on that hand, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is in this. He says also, that it was needless to speak of the former Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of her Life, after she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed to <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Incest</hi> with her own <hi>Brother.</hi> But when both she and her <hi>Brother</hi> died, denying this, and that it was generally thought she suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered injustly, then former Scandals should have been alledged to make the Justice of her Sentence appear the more evidently, therefore the silence of the Writers of that time, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that occasion, is still a good Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Argument: but he turns this matter upon me with some shew of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57150:59"/>
Reason, and says, <hi>That since none writ a justification of</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Bullen, <hi>neither then nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, this is a just prejudice against her.</hi> But the Unfortunate have sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom pens imployed for their Honour: and in Queen <hi>Elisabeth</hi>'s time it was thought below the Dignity of the <hi>Daughter,</hi> to examin too critically all the Reports that malicious Writers had set on foot against the <hi>Mother.</hi> For if any impudent man would que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the Birth and Descent of a <hi>Crowned Head,</hi> severer tools than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futations are thought the properest ways of answering them. He then tells me, <hi>why should I be believed more than the Catholick Writers?</hi> But I ask not to be believed on my own word; but I have shewed the Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the story that <hi>Sanders</hi> and our Author from him, at second hand, had contrived of <hi>Anne Bullen</hi>; for what is impossible, can never be true, by my Logick; but our Author shews how little he ought to be believed upon his Word; for I having given for a proof of <hi>Anne Bullens</hi> good Reputation, this, that she served <hi>Claude,</hi> Queen of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57150:60"/>
                     <hi>France,</hi> which he had set down truly in one page, but in the very next page being to repeat and examin this, he turns it as if I had made her serving <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfths second <hi>Queen</hi> a proof of her vertue. I knew the vertues of Queen <hi>Claude</hi> were as <hi>sublime</hi> as the others were <hi>questioned</hi>: therefore I had made her serving the one as an evidence of the good esteem in which she was; and this he would turn aside in a way very lime himself: and wheras he had mentioned <hi>English Authors,</hi> in the <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and had set only <hi>Sanders</hi> on the Margin, I had reason to ask if he could make a plural out of him, as he had done out of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth; he tells me, he had cited <hi>Florimond de Raimond</hi>; but I do not yet find another, to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the plural of the <hi>English</hi>; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Title the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> may have to <hi>Guienne,</hi> so that <hi>Florimond</hi> may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned in some sort among his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, yet all this does not put him among the <hi>English Authors</hi>; so the <hi>Sanders</hi> is still all that we have for the <hi>plural</hi>; and all the Histories that have appeared since his time by the Writers of that Communion, are nothing but he over

particular, that there was none of all her <hi>Ladies</hi> brought to swear any thing against her; now it is certain, that no <hi>Queen,</hi> especially in such a Court as that of <hi>England</hi> was then, the Household being the greatest in <hi>Christendom,</hi> could be guilty of so many disorders as were laid to her charge, without taking some Woman into the Confidence, and yet none were either accused of it, or brought to Witness it.

                        <hi>P.</hi> 359.</note> I will state the Matter in short: He had given a long Abstract of Reasons, which he had pretended to have drawn out of <hi>Cajetan's Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:57150:64"/>
that had no appearance of truth in them, such as that of the <hi>blocking up of</hi> Constantinople, <hi>the avoiding to Mary in Houses, suspect of Heresy,</hi> with several other Follys. I upon that concluded this must be as true as his other Quotations were; so I searcht for <hi>Cajetans Works,</hi> not having then by me those Extracts that I had made, when I writ my <hi>History.</hi> I found only at first his great Work on <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas's Summs,</hi> of which I made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my <hi>Appendix</hi>; but having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that found the <hi>Consultation</hi> it self, set down by <hi>Raynoldus,</hi> I desired the learned Author of the <hi>Nouvelles of the Common-wealth of Learning,</hi> to give notice in the Moneth of <hi>April,</hi> that I owned my mistake: but it was added in that Advertisement, <hi>that I had as much reason as ever to say, that</hi> Mr. Varilas <hi>had not cited it as he ought to have done:</hi> upon which he in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary method of sincerity says, <hi>that I had retracted all, and passed a condemnation upon my self,</hi>

                        <hi>P.</hi> 484.</note> 
                     <hi>for all that I had said concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> Cajetan. If I were disposed to be Angry, or to use foul Language,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57150:65"/>
here is a just enough provocation on his part; but I do here repeat what I had said, that the whole Abstract that he had given of that <hi>Consultation</hi> in his History, is false in every one of the reasons, upon which he pretends, that <hi>Cajetan</hi> founded his Conclusion. The only thing that looks like an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to Truth, is yet far from it; for he had said, <hi>that</hi> Cajetan <hi>laid down this for a ground, that the High Priest under the Old Testament could dispence with such a degree of Marriage, and by consequence, that the High Priest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Testament must have the like Authority.</hi> Now there is not a word of this in <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who knew too well that it was not the High Priest, but the express Letter of the Law, that allowed of such a Marriage under the Old Testament: So that <hi>Cajetan</hi> did not argue with relation to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular case, but he argued upon the General topick, that <hi>as under the Old Testament all hard Matters were to be referred to the High Priest's Decision, so the like ought also to be admitted under the New.</hi> Now a man must be dull to Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s degree, not to see the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57150:65"/>
difference that is between these two things. And as for all the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars that he had given as the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract of <hi>Cajetan's Consultation,</hi> there is not one word of one of them to be found in it. He argues against that which in my <hi>History</hi> I prove, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ordered <hi>Campana</hi> to say to the <hi>King,</hi> by telling me, that if <hi>it is true, the Pope was the worst Politican that ever was, since he was then so much in the Emperour's power.</hi> But the Politick was not so bad as Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> fancies, since <hi>Campana</hi>'s words, tho he carried a credence with him, might have been easily disowned. Yet if this were not the case, must a plain proof be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, <hi>because then the Pope was an ill Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litican</hi>? No body besides Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> would argue in this manner. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning in what follows against positive proofs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 366.</note> is all of a piece; but because my <hi>Garand</hi> for this is not in an Author like <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> but in a <hi>Letter</hi> writ by <hi>Cassali</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> who was at that time the King's <hi>Ambassadour</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and these words he uses, are of great consequence I shall here set them down in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>

even Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it; that when one declines a Court, he can no more plead before it, since by pleading before it he passes from his <hi>Declinator</hi>; he, after he has shewed that he took this from <hi>Florimond,</hi>

unless he was as Ignorant as Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is, then this makes it more probable, that he was not the Author of that <hi>Book,</hi> but that <hi>F.

                     <hi>to be able to describe the Intriques of great men in the matters of Amour; and it he has not that, as he reproaches me for denying it to him, since I had allowed him all the good qualities of a Historian, except that of Truth, those who praise his works chiefly in this point, are much deceived: and then he justifies himself with a Quotation out of Florimond.</hi> I will not dispute much with him whether the <hi>quality of setting forth A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> is the <hi>Principal one of a Historian</hi>: tho I do not deny but in a Reign of much Dissolution, this is necessary:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57150:72"/>
but I will add, that this is the hardest to be found out unless one has lived in the time; for those are matters in which, as it is easy to slander, so the only persons who know those Secrets, are very shye of writing them, and are generally men of Pleasure themselves, and not much given to writing. I have already satisfied Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> by my retracting the praises that I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deservedly given him: but I find he would let that of Truth go, and would compound the matter, if he might but have the other Qualities allowed him: but now I am worse-natured, and will allow none of them to him: and I as little believe what he says of the <hi>Praises that some give his works, on that account,</hi> as I do his other Quotations.

                        <hi>P.</hi> 433.</note> this from any man but him, would have put me in some disorder; but I know his way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting now too well, to be alarmed at any thing he can say.

for my only Crime is, that I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied an Assertion of his so <hi>modestly</hi> as only to say, <hi>I had never found it in any Author</hi>; upon which he pretends to infer, <hi>That to justify this, I must say two things; the one, that I have read all Books, whether printed or Manuscripts; the other is, that I have forgot nothing of that which I have read: which two things, says he, very gravely, are not found in any one man without a miracle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho I should have thought, that neither the one nor the other could be found in any man without a miracle: and now is it not evidently made out, that I am the <hi>Rashest of all men</hi>?</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57150:73"/>
in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> had been considered in all the Ages of the Church as Moral and Indispensable Laws: so I had added, that <hi>according to the Principles of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>his Marriage with his Brothers Wife was Unlawful</hi>: He reproaches me for this, since <hi>I am of a Religion that rejects Tradition abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.</hi> But still it made the <hi>Kings cause</hi> good against that <hi>Church,</hi> which makes <hi>Tradition the only sure Expounder of Scripture</hi>: for if the Tradition was here of the <hi>King</hi>'s side, then all <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> Reasoning against it, was no more to be considered than according to themselves <hi>Luther</hi>'s and <hi>Calvin</hi>'s ought to have been: besides, we of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion</hi> do not so <hi>absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all Tradition,</hi> as not to accept of it according to the famous expression of <hi>Vincent</hi> of <hi>Lerins, When the Tradition is Universal in all Times and in all Places.</hi>

any such qualification, returns so often in his third and fourth <hi>Tomes,</hi> always indeed when he had occasion to speak of the <hi>Rebels in England,</hi> that I have reason to believe, that he adds this of <hi>False Zealots</hi> now, because he dares not say otherwise, when he is forced to explain himself; but his hardiness in denying that the <hi>Sorbon</hi> in the time of the <hi>League,</hi> or that Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> in his <hi>Harangue to the third Estate,</hi> did own that doctrine of <hi>deposing Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Princes,</hi> is no surprise to me, since it comes from him; for I can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him, that I am past the being amased at his Ignorance, or his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, either in asserting or denying.

and he fancied I had said, that he had <hi>owned this</hi>; upon which he protests, <hi>that he neither thought it, said it, nor writ it; and that it could not be found in any page of his Books.</hi> But I can assure him, when I say, <hi>it is certain,</hi> I never think of him: for his <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> are the two things in the World, that are the most opposite to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my thoughts. I had denied that any thing had appeared in the Tilting at <hi>Greenwich</hi>: but to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of this, he gives me two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are equally strong: The one is, that once at <hi>Naples</hi> something like this fell, out, and the other is <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s Authority; and if I will not believe these two, he leaves me to my Incredulity.</p>
                  <p n="69">LXIX. He says, <hi>I shew a very good Opinion of my self,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 467.</note> if I expect to be believed in this point, whether</hi> Anne Bullens <hi>Father was one of her Iudges, against all other Writers.</hi> No, it is only that I have a good opinion of my eye-sight, and that, having seen the Original Record, and marked the place where any body else may see for it, I expect
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57150:77"/>
to be believed beyond those who write only upon Hear-say: and when our Author gives such marks of sincerity in his Quotations, as I have done in mine; then if I question his <hi>Papers,</hi> he may use the right of <hi>Reprisal</hi> upon me; but this is the case between us.</p>
                  <p n="70">LXX. He tells me the use of the term <hi>Stoical</hi> is now altered in <hi>France</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 468.</note> if it is so, I was not bound to know that: but this ought not to come into so high a reckoning. The term <hi>Stoical</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be affected to that Philosophy, whose character was an <hi>Insensibility</hi> and a <hi>constant equality of temper</hi>; so I had reason to say, this was ill applied to <hi>Anne Bullen.</hi> The little he says after this, is so slight, that I cannot dwell upon it: every <hi>Reader</hi> will see, that he had a brow of a peculiar composition, that could say, that I had added nothing in those <hi>Articles</hi> that are in my <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix</hi>; and that I had only repeated those things that I had already said in my <hi>Reflections</hi>: and because he knew he could answer no part of it, he thought the more dextrous way of avoiding to do it, was to send his Reader back to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57150:77"/>
the former parts of the Book: hoping no doubt that they would not be at that pains, and so he fancied he had very artificially put all that by him; but as my <hi>Appendix</hi> contains not any one thing that was in the former part of my Book, so he had not answered any one tittle in it in those parts to which he sends his <hi>Reader</hi>; yet if he does not answer that which I had said, he makes me say that, which I had not said concerning <hi>Cajetan,</hi> as appears by the words which are upon the first Page, of the <hi>Nouvelles of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Learning</hi> for the Month of <hi>April.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> sees, that those <hi>great Affairs, that as he tells me, are upon my hands,</hi> have not hindred me from dispatching so <hi>small a one</hi> as his is. Neither this, nor the <hi>Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of my <hi>Reflections</hi> on his second <hi>Volum,</hi> could hold me long. I should have had both many scruples and much uneasiness upon me, if this had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired much of my time; but I have prevailed with my self to bestow a <hi>week</hi> on each of them. If it were a matter of any Importance on which I
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57150:78"/>
had writ, I should have thought, that the owning the hast in which it was writ, was a disparaging of it: but since it was imploy'd in so mean and so easy a performance, I think it is a Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my self to confess the speed I made in it. It will perhaps be a little longer a digesting to Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> than it was a preparing to me. One Proof will quickly appear whether the world is so satisfied with his Answer, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that to return to any tolerable thoughts of his <hi>History</hi>; for I have been informed from <hi>England,</hi> that a Gentleman, who is famous both for <hi>Poetry and several other things,</hi> had spent three moneths in translating Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>'s <hi>History,</hi> but that as soon as my <hi>Reflections</hi> appeared, he discontinued his Labour, finding the credit of his Author was gone: now if he thinks it is recovered by his Answer, he will perhaps go on with his <hi>Translation</hi>: and this may be, for ought I know, as good an entertainment for him as the conversation that he had set on between the <hi>Hinds</hi> and the <hi>Panthers,</hi> and all the rest of the <hi>Animals</hi>; for whom Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> may serve well enough as an
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57150:78"/>
Author; and this <hi>History</hi> and that <hi>Poem</hi> are such extraordinary things of their kind, that it will be but suteable to see the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>worst Poem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come likewise the <hi>Translator</hi> of the <hi>worst History,</hi> that the Age has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. If his <hi>Grace</hi> and his <hi>Wit</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove both proportionably, we will hardly find that he has gained much by the change he has made, from having no <hi>Religion</hi> to choose <hi>one</hi> of the worst. It is true, he had somewhat to sink from, in the matter of <hi>Wit,</hi> but as for his <hi>Morals,</hi> it is scarce possible for him to grow a <hi>worse man</hi> than he was. He has lately wreaked his Malice on me for spoiling his three moneths la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but in it he has done me all the the honour that any man can receive from him, which is to be railed at by him. If I had ill nature enough to prompt me to wish a very bad wish for him, it should be, that he would go on and finish his <hi>Translation</hi>: by that it will appear, whether the <hi>English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is the most Competent Judge in this matter, has upon the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Debate, pronounced in Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s favour, or in mine. It is true,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57150:79"/>
M. D. will suffer a little by it, but at least it will serve to keep him in from other Extravagancies: and if he gains little Honour by this work, yet he cannot lose so much by it as he has done by his last Imployment.</p>

                     <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
                     <p>I Have perhaps said already more than enough for laying open those <hi>HIsto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> that have appeared hitherto with so much pomp: and that have been received much more favourably than they deserved. It is perhaps a little too cruel in me, to pursue Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> so closely, when he has drawn the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of all the World upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Mr. <hi>Hosier</hi> was not satisfied to call him an <hi>Impostor,</hi> and an <hi>Author of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,</hi> in a private Letter to a Friend, but was willing to let this be publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that all the world might likewise know it: and Mr. <hi>Larroque</hi> has laid
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57150:79"/>
open his Errors and Impostures so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously, that he has at the same time discovered his own Learning and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness, as well as the Ignorance and the Falsehoods of Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> in which he has shewed himself to be the worthy <hi>Son</hi> of so great a <hi>Father,</hi> and has given such an Essay of what may be expected from him upon greater occasions, that the world will long for more of the Production of such a Pen. But because Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> intends to treat all <hi>Nations,</hi> and all <hi>Illustrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> alike ill, and to shew that he is equally ignorant and bold with them all: I will only add here one part of the <hi>Remarks</hi> that those <hi>learned Persons</hi> who publish the <hi>Abstracts of Books</hi> in <hi>Leipsig</hi> have made on him, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the moneth of <hi>October,</hi> 1686.</p>
                     <p>In which after they have shewed, that he writes almost all names false; that he confounds the Order of time, and the persons concerning whom he writes; that he does not know the <hi>Map</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> nor the situation of Towns, or the division of the <hi>Circles,</hi> nor the Interests in which the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> were at that time; that he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57150:80"/>
contradicts in one part of his Book what he had said in another; that he sets down the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Leipsig</hi> 18. years before it was done; he who was their <hi>Prince</hi> all that while, having been so noted an Enemy to that work; that the whole Relation he gives of <hi>Fronsberg,</hi> is false in all the parts of it, as well in the Character of the Man, as in his Actions, and both in his own death and in the death of his Children; besides all these, in every one of which they give a great many Instances, they conclude with that which is more remarkable, and in which their duty to their <hi>Prince</hi> made them the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, since it touches one from whom the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> is lineally descended by the Maternal Line. The fault is indeed worthy of Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> and in that I say a great deal: it is this, Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> says,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 89.</note> 
                        <hi>That</hi> Albert of Brandenburg, <hi>who from being Master of the</hi> Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Order, <hi>was made Duke of</hi> Prussia, <hi>did when he was</hi> 69. <hi>years old</hi> (he adds <hi>compleat,</hi> for he loves to be exact) <hi>marryed</hi> Dorothee, <hi>Princess of</hi> Holstein (tho she was indeed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57150:80"/>
Daughter to <hi>Frederick</hi> the First King of <hi>Denmark) that She who was very young, consented to the Marriage, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping he would shortly dye, and that so She would carry away a vast Fortune with her; but She was notably deceived; for She quickly bore him a Son, which cut off her hopes of having his Wealth: but which was worse, She spent</hi> 30. <hi>years of her life with him, so long did he live after their Marriage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> might have found the Falsehood of all this out of the common Genealogists, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar out of <hi>Chytraeus,</hi> whom he cites. <hi>Albert</hi> was born in the year 1490. and married the Daughter of <hi>Denmark</hi> in the year 1525. which was in the 35. year of his Age. She bore him several children, but one Daughter only came to Age, who was married to the Duke of <hi>Meklebourg.</hi> She died after they had lived 22. years together: and after that in the year 1550. when <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was now 60. year old, he married to a Daughter of the House of <hi>Bruns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> by whom he had the Son, that succeeded him in the Dutchy of <hi>Prussia</hi>: he had also many Daughters by her,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57150:81"/>
of whom one was married to the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and another to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector</hi> of <hi>Bradenbourg,</hi> and the rest to other <hi>Princes</hi>: and this <hi>Albert</hi> died in the year 1568. in the 78. year of his Age, which one would have thought was a great Age: but Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> must be <hi>Sublime</hi> in every thing, so he makes him to have lived till he was 99. Some have wisht that such hints as these are might be furnished from the men of the several <hi>Nations</hi> that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has brought into his <hi>History</hi>: for it must be confessed, that no man has ever taken so much pains to make himself be so generally decried as he has done, by giving every Kingdom an <hi>Act</hi> in his <hi>Play</hi>; that so all <hi>Europe</hi> over he may be equally despised: and therefore all further pains concerning him may be well superseded. I am sure, I am more than weary of him.</p>
