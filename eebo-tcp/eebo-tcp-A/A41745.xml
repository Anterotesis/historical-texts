         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as the holding that Land

            <p>This I have been ambitious

            <p>THE Author of theſe Sermons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
induced to publiſh the three
former, by the Deſires and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of ſome conſiderable Perſons, who
heard them preached, hath choſen himſelf
to add the fourth; in which he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to finiſh what he began in the
third. He knows they are ſent forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Learned and Critical, and (which is
more diſcouraging) into a Contentious and
Cenſorious World. But he is willing to
ſacrifice his Name and Reputation, and
whatever he accounts dear or pretious, to
the Cauſe of God and the King, and to the
Intereſts of Peace, and Truth, and Juſtice.
He is content to paſs thorow evil Report,
or good Report, if by the Divine Favour
and Bleſſing, theſe plain Diſcourſes may be
any way beneficial even to the meaneſt
Readers, by convincing them whom they
are to Reform, and whom they are to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
and how impoſſible it is to be good
Chriſtians, if they be not good Subjects;
that being preſerved from the pernicious

It is alſo the great Deſign of the Goſpel,
by the cleareſt Methods of Inſtruction,
by the moſt powerful Arts of Perſuaſion,
by all its excellent Precepts, encouraging
Promiſes, and awakening Threatnings,
effectually to enforce this very Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Our Lord and Saviour came into
the World to call <hi>ſinners to repentance;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat 9. 13.</note>
that is, to a removal out of the paths of
ſin, or a return from their evil ways, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a better courſe of Life and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
His eminent Forerunner cryed in
the Wilderneſs,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand.</hi> Which he himſelf
too, while he lived upon earth, earneſtly
urged with his own moſt gracious lips;
warning and aſſuring men, that except
they would repent,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 3, 5.</note> they ſhould all periſh.
And when he aſcended to Heaven, he
left this Charge with his Apoſtles, that
<hi>Repentance and Remiſſion of ſins ſhould be
preached in his Name among all Nations.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk 24. 47</note>
He commanded them to publiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to all the World, That he, who is
the Son of God,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 6.</note> having given himſelf a
Ranſom for all,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note> and taſted Death for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man; by Vertue of his Death and
Paſſion, all thoſe of Mankind that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of their Rebellion againſt God, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106810:11"/>
return to a ſincere Obedience to him,
ſhall obtain Pardon of ſin, eſcape that
Eternal Death, which is their deſerved
Puniſhment, and be made partakers of
Everlaſting Happineſs.</p>
            <p>In Obedience to this Command, and
in Imitation of thoſe Examples, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Repentance hath been much
inſiſted on by the Apoſtles and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
in every Age. And yet, as much
as it hath been preached, there are ſome
perſons in almoſt all places widely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
about the Nature of it, and very
many that neglect to practiſe it; among
which, ſome think themſelves priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and exempted, and ſo take no care
about a matter wherein they ſuppoſe
they are unconcerned; others imagine it
to be a work altogether out of their
power, and therefore deſpair of doing it;
others preſume they can do it any time,
when they will, which makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
delay it. I hope, by the help of
God, to ſpeak ſomething to the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
at leaſt of theſe ſeveral ſorts of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitents,
and with reſpect to each of
them, I ſhall conſider theſe four things.</p>
            <p>The true Nature of Repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106810:12"/>
The Obligation that lies upon all men
to repent.</p>
            <p>The Power God giveth them to do
this. And</p>
            <p>The proper Seaſon for it.</p>
            <p>All which Heads of Diſcourſe offer
themſelves to us in the Text. The firſt,
which is the Nature of Repentance, is
here plainly deſcribed by <hi>Returning from
our evil Ways, and Amending our Doings.</hi>
The ſecond, The Obligation that lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all men, without exception, thus to
repent, to return, and amend, is alſo
clearly expreſſed, <hi>Return ye every man.</hi>
The third, The Power men have to do
this, is implied in the whole Precept, as
delivered from God, ſince it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
with his Infinite Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to require an Impoſſible Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And laſtly, The proper Time and
Seaſon for this Work is declared to be
Now, the preſent Time. <hi>Return ye now,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I begin with the firſt, The Nature of
Repentance deſcribed in my Text, by
<hi>Returning</hi> and <hi>Amending.</hi> And here I
ſhall not detain you with any long Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue
on an Argument that hath exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106810:12"/>
ſo many Tongues and Pens, but
ſhall only endeavour in a few words, to
give ſuch an Account thereof, as may
ſerve to diſabuſe the deluded Sinner, and
detect ſome prevailing Errours in this
Affair of ſo great conſequence.</p>
            <p>To ſay nothing of the meer Shadows
and Appearances, thoſe Pictures and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of this Great Duty, the rent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
disfigured Faces, demure Looks,
Heads bowed down like a Bul-ruſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
There are many things which, with a
more fair and plauſible pretence, paſs
under the Name and Notion of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
There are</p>
            <p>Convictions and Awakenings of
Conſcience,</p>
            <p>Confeſſions and Supplications,</p>
            <p>Sorrow and Regret occaſioned by
ſin,</p>
            <p>Purpoſes and Reſolutions againſt it.</p>
            <p>But all theſe put together will not
conſtitute us true Penitents, unleſs we
add what the Text requires, a real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
and Reformation, a Returning
from our evil ways, and an Amendment
of our doings. The former may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive
Acts, good preparatives to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
but this latter is the Thing it
ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106810:13"/>
When Repentance is ſpoken of, or
called for in Holy Scripture, it is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſcribed by ſuch Phraſes as theſe,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19</note>

               <note place="margin">Jer. 4. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Turning and Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <hi>Purifying our Hearts, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nigh unto God, Caſting off the Works
of darkneſs, and putting on the Armour
of light.</hi> From which, and the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
it is very evident, That true
Repentance is a real Converſion, a turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from all ſin unto God. St <hi>Peter</hi>
words his advice thus, <hi>Acts 3. 19. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and be converted, that your ſins may
be blotted out.</hi> And thus God himſelf
interprets his own Command, when he
requires Repentance, <hi>Ezek. 18. 30. Repent,
ſaith the Lord, and turn your ſelves from
all your Tranſgreſſions, ſo Iniquity ſhall not
be your Ruine.</hi> And whenever Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is ſet forth in Scripture by any
kind of Convictions, Confeſſions, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
or Reſolutions, they are ſuppoſed
to be truly ſincere, and immediately
productive of Converſion and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106810:13"/>
but without this Effect, they are
totally invalid.</p>
            <p>The cleareſt Convictions, and the
moſt inlightned Apprehenſions of all that
Evil, which is to be found in any of our
Ways or doings, are no Arguments of
true Repentance, unleſs that Light hath
a genuine and free Operation upon our
Wills and Affections, to move them to
ſuch an Abhorrence of all thoſe evil Ways
and Doings, as concludes in the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them. For otherwiſe <hi>Balaam</hi>
whoſe Eyes were opened, and <hi>Eſau</hi> and
<hi>Judas,</hi> who had ſo great Apprehenſions
of Sin and their Loſs by it, and <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar</hi>
and <hi>Darius,</hi> who had ſuch a
Senſe of the Majeſty of God, and <hi>Herod</hi>
who heard St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gladly, and
<hi>Felix</hi> who trembled at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Diſcourſe,
yea, and the very Devils, who are ſaid to
believe and tremble, muſt all be placed
in the Catalogue of Penitents.</p>
            <p>And although theſe inward Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may break out into Confeſſions and
Supplications, yet no Confeſſion or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
whatſoever, is any Act of ſincere
Repentance, except it flow from a real
Hatred of Sin, and be attended with an
Endeavour to forſake it. 'Tis ſad to ſee,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106810:14"/>
how Men run the Round of Sinning and
Confeſſing, and Sinning again and then
Confeſſing again, all the while conceiting
themſelves to be ſecure enough in that
black Circle: As if every ſin, although
never ſo often repeated, were as ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated
as confeſſed. But do they think to
cheat and charm God Almighty thus ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily,
when they come to him, with their
Hypocritical Acknowledgments, and feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Promiſes of Amendment, made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
with much appearance of Affection,
but not without ſome kind of mental Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
or ſecret Intention of affronting
him again? Will the great Searcher of
Hearts be appeaſed by ſuch a Mock De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
as <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh paid to the
little Image he wore in his Cap, which,
when he deſigned the Murder of any
whom he feared or hated, he would take
from his Head and kiſs, beſeeching it to
pardon him that one Evil Act more, and
it ſhould be the laſt? What performance
can be more ſlight, what more eaſie and
trivial, than to give God a few good
words, like the Complements we beſtow
upon Men, and to exclaim againſt our
ſelves in perfunctory Confeſſions? There
is no Mortification in all this; it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſts
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106810:14"/>
neither Blood nor Spirits; it lops
off none of our Limbs; it breaks none
of our Bones.</p>
            <p>And what if our Confeſſions be made
with ſome pain and ſorrow? That doth
not preſently argue the ſincerity of our
Repentance. Every Melancholy Fit at the
Remembrance of our ſins, is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Godly Sorrow. For no ſmall
grief and ſadneſs may ariſe in the Mind
of the moſt impenitent Criminal, not
out of any Diſlike of his Fault, but of
the Puniſhment that follows it; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
himſelf is wicked, but becauſe there
are good Laws againſt him, and a juſt
Power and Authority to put them in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.
The ſinner may be extremely
troubled to ſee, that what is ſo pleaſant
to him is not ſafe. The Preſage of the
uneaſineſs of Hell,<note place="margin">Acts. 5. 33.</note> in which all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of ſin are like to conclude,<note place="margin">Acts. 7. 54.</note> may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
cut him to the Heart, and yet this
Grief may little or nothing abate his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to it. He may ſtill look kindly
on his beloved Luſts, although he behold
them with Tears in his Eyes. But when
he thus weeps not at the Evil, but at the
Danger of thoſe ways in which he walks,
and will not return from the Evil, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106810:15"/>
though he hath ſo ſad a Proſpect of the
Danger, his wilful Guilt defiles his Tears,
but his Tears will never cleanſe his Guilt.
When all the Terrors of his Mind, and all
thoſe Anticipations of Hell, thoſe gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Worm, which he feels in his
Conſcience, cannot perſuade him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
his doings; ſuch a high Fortitude
in ſin, ſuch a reſolute Embracing it under
ſo difficult Circumſtances, plainly ſhews
that he is wedded to it with indiſſoluble
Bonds, hath taken it for better and for
worſe, and will keep and maintain it,
with its Delights and Pleaſures, and with
its Plagues and Torments too, never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be divorced from it.</p>
            <p>But if the Apprehenſion of infinite Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and the formidable Aſpect of inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
Miſery, have ſome Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him to cool his Affection to his Sins,
and produce Reſolutions of Amendment,
this indeed is a good Step towards Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but ſtill there may be a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Diſtance, betweeen the Purpoſe and
the Thing it ſelf. When Men have ſurfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with their ſins, they caſt them up
with Bitterneſs, make paſſionate Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt them, and waſh themſelves,
as they think, in penitential Tears, but as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106810:15"/>
ſoon as the Tears are dried up, the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
are forgotten, and they return to
the Vomit and Mire. Thus he who was
intemperate the laſt Meal, reſolves to
faſt the next; but when a few Hours have
wrought off the heavy Load of his firſt
Exceſs, he adds a ſecond, and his Vow of
Abſtinence is either not remembred, or
not regarded. But ſuch ineffectual Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
ſo ſuddenly broken, do rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance,
than expiate our Guilt; and ſurely
the Aggravations of ſin deſerve not to be
numbred among the Acts of Repentance.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, ſet a man have the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
Convictions of the Evil of his Ways,
let him make ſolemn Confeſſions and
Supplications, and do it with ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
at the ſad Conſequences of his ſins,
and ſome Reſolutions againſt them, he
hath not yet repented with that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which will procure a Pardon from
God, unleſs he return and amend. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Church, to prevent all miſtakes,
begins her Abſolution with theſe Words.
<hi>Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, who deſireth not the Death of
a Sinner, but rather that he may turn from
his Wickedneſs and live,</hi>—implying
that there is no Repentance unto Life,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106810:16"/>
without turning from ſin; no true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
but the true Convert. And thus
much is evident, even from the proper
and natural ſignification of thoſe two
words in the New Teſtament, by which
Repentance is expreſſed, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the one importing a real change
of Mind, the other better care for the
future. So that if we be ſinners, there
is an indiſpenſable Neceſſity of altering
the Temper of our Minds, and the Courſe
of our Actions. Nothing can ſecure us
but a real Reformation; nothing leſs than
this can evince the Truth of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
And the Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ought to be applied by us to the
right Objects, to our own evil Ways and
Doings, and to all of them without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
This the Text expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
<hi>Return ye now every man from his</hi>
(his own) <hi>evil ways, amend your</hi> (your

            </p>
            <p>The World is full of Reformers, and
yet there is but little Reformation. The
Reaſon is, becauſe moſt men love to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

rather than the Dunghil at their own
Doors.</p>
            <p>But the true Penitent is a more humble

               <hi>one who ſtudies to

but he will endeavour to make an
impartial Reformation of every thing
that is amiſs.</p>
            <p>If we forſake our ſins only in part, or

Or, is not this rather the very Policy
and Subtilty of Wickedneſs, whereby we
diſcover our deeper Skill in the Trade
and Myſtery of Iniquity?</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to vindicate
Repentance from ſome falſe and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

            </p>
            <p>The next thing to be conſidered is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Univerſal Obligation, which lies upon all

which was my ſecond Obſervable. <hi>Return

But ſince the indiſpenſable Obligation
that lies upon every man, to <hi>return and
amend,</hi> is ſo plainly expreſſed in the Text,
I proceed to the third Obſervable, <hi>The
Power God gives men to do this;</hi> which,
although it be not ſo expreſly declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is moſt certainly implied; as we
muſt needs acknowledge, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that this is the great, conſtant,
and peremptory Command of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by all his Servants the Prophets.
And the words, in which it is delivered,
are Verbs active of the Imperative Mood,
<hi>Return ye, Amend ye.</hi> They call for
Action, the Effect of Power, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſuppoſeth the Being of its Cauſe.
For no Effect can be produced, where
there is not a capable Efficient; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth God ever require that it
ſhould. It cannot conſiſt with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Wiſdom and Goodneſs, to put us
upon an impoſſible Undertaking, or to
command us any Thing, which we
have no Power or Capacity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
although we uſe the moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Endeavour. If he did, ſuch a
Command would not be Obligatory.
No Perſon can be obliged by any
Law of God or Man to do that, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106810:19"/>
is not poſſible for him to do. By all
the Meaſures of Reaſon and Equity,
the total Want of a Power to obey,
excuſeth from Obedience. As we may
clearly ſee in ſome particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God, which in ſome Caſes
we are not obliged, becauſe not able,
to obſerve. The Man that lies lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
upon the Bed of Sickneſs, is
not bound to come to the publick
Prayers of the Church; nor the Deaf,
to hear Sermons; nor the Dumb, to
make an Oral Confeſſion of his Faith.
But the general Precept of Forſaking
our Sins and Reforming our Actions,
obligeth every Man in what Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
ſoever he be placed; becauſe
every one may do this, if he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly
willing.</p>
            <p>'Tis very plain, that the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
to Repentance and Amendment
of Life, lies in Mens Wills, and not
in their Want of Power. For if they
had no Power at all to reform their
Lives and Actions, if they were forced
to go on ſtill in the Ways of Sin
their walking in them would not be
ſinful. They could be charged with
no Fault, in doing, what they could
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106810:19"/>
not help. But that which makes men
truly criminal, that which makes them
Sinners, and guilty before God, is this,
That they omit ſomething required,
which they might perform if they
would, or do ſomething forbidden,
which they might avoid.</p>
            <p>All actual Sin is either the Neglect
or Abuſe of ſome Power or Faculty
given us by God, which we ſhould
and might employ to a better Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>It is therefore in the Power of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man to forſake his Sins in good
meaſure, and to amend his courſe of
Life; This every Rational Man would
certainly do, if he did not wilfully
neglect or abuſe the Power he hath.
Men indeed, by their ſad degeneracy
from the Primitive State of Humane
Nature, have contracted a great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
and Weakneſs; but this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
they might in ſome meaſure
put off and be freed from, if they would;
this is not ſuch a Weakneſs, as is really
diſtinct from Wilfulneſs. If the By as
of their Wills were not ſo propenſe to
their Evil Ways, they might return
from them; and when the Scripture
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106810:20"/>
ſeems to repreſent their Condition to
be ſuch, that they cannot, the Senſe
of ſuch Texts may be no more than
this, That their Wills are ſo depraved,
ſo bent to Wickedneſs, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
obtain of themſelves to be Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to do what they eaſily might
do, if they were not unwilling. For
Inſtance, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in the eight
Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Verſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
<hi>The carnal Mind cannot be
ſubject to the Law of God.</hi> Not, as if
ſinful men were perfectly unable to
forſake their Vicious Practices, and
obey the Holy Commandments. But
he means, that through the Love of
Sin, and Hatred of the Div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne Law,
they cannot obtain of themſelves to
be willing to renounce the one, and
ſubmit to the other. For he ſaith in
the ſame Place, that <hi>the carnal mind is
Enmity to God;</hi> and this is the chief
Reaſon, why it cannot be ſubject to
his Law. The Man that heads an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
Rebellion, cannot pretend that
he hath no Ability to ſerve his Prince:
He hath Strength and Forces at his
command, if they were not miſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by his diſloyal Affection. And
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106810:20"/>
every Sinner hath Faculties and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which he might call off from the
Service of Sin to the Service of
God, were it not for the Naughtineſs
of his Heart.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That although Men
have the Power to repent and amend,
yet the Want of a willing Mind will
certainly hinder them from it; neither
can they obtain a Willingneſs of Mind,
without the Grace of God renewing
their Wills, and effectually inclining
them to better Ways and Doings. All
this I readily acknowledge, but this
ſhould not diſcourage any from endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to repent and reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
Becauſe the Divine Grace and
Aſſiſtance is never denied to mens ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and earneſt Endeavours; our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Saviour having aſſured us, that
<hi>God will give his holy Spirit to them
that ask him,</hi> Luk. 11. 13. No man
therefore is ſo far void of Power to repent
and amend, but he might do it if he
were willing, and he ſhall alſo by
Degrees be made willing, if he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
pray for the Grace of the Holy
Spirit, and with his Prayers joyn his
conſtant Endeavours to bring his Will
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106810:21"/>
to ſome complyance with the Will of
God. Whoever takes this courſe and
perſeveres in it; let him not be afraid,
he ſhall not miſcarry.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall ſtill contend, that men
cannot ſo much as pray for the Grace
of God with any degree of Sincerity,
nor uſe any ſincere Endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
themſelves, except God enable
them ſo to pray and ſo to endeavour,
and therefore that they have no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
at all, and can do nothing in the
leaſt towards theſe Effects; this Sequel
is to be denied. For although no man
hath any Power in and from himſelf,
either of Repenting, or of Fraying to
God for his Grace; yet all, even the
worſt of Men, have ſome Power to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it given them from God, and
thoſe that uſe the Power given them
ſhall ſtill receive more and more.</p>
            <p>Is there not ſuch a Thing as the
Preventing Grace of God, whereby he
is aforehand with us, and moſt freely
begins to diſpoſe and incline us to
Repentance and Reformation, before
we do in the leaſt either deſire it or
endeavour it. The Beginning of ſuch
a good Diſpoſition and Inclination, is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106810:21"/>
I conceive at ſome time or other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
wrought by the moſt juſt and
merciful God in all the Children of
Men. He finds a Time to awaken
the Natural Conſcience of every Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to raiſe in him a Senſe of his
Guilt, and a Fear of his Danger; which
Apprehenſions, if they be not oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
or ſuppreſſed, will put him
upon Endeavours to provide for his
own Safety.</p>
            <p>And upon ſuch Awakenings of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
there are none but might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to amend their Doings, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
leſs ſinful by leaving off ſome
of their ill Practices. Although they
cannot arrive at a Mature State of
Piety and Vertue all on a ſudden, yet
they might look, and make towards
it, with ſome deſires and Endeavours
to attain it. They have Power doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to reform in part, which if they
do, God will ſupply them with more
Power; and if they proceed in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance,
as it is afforded them, they ſhall ſtill
receive larger and larger Meaſures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
until the Work of Reformation be
perfected. <hi>He that hath</hi> (that is, he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106810:22"/>
that improves what he hath) <hi>to him
more ſhall be given; but he that hath
not</hi> (that is, he that doth not improve
what he hath) <hi>from him ſhall be taken
away, even that which he hath,</hi> Mark
4. 25.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, The Holy Spirit of God
doth ſooner or later come home to all
our Souls, in ſome meaſure, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the Aids of his Grace to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of us. Now when men
<hi>quench the Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 9.</note> and <hi>reſiſt the holy
Ghoſt,</hi> as often as he ſtrives with them;
when they ſtifle his Convictions,<note place="margin">Acts. 7. 51.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
his Motions, and put off all ſerious
and awakning Conſiderations working in
them; when they endeavour to drown
the Voice of Conſcience, which is the
Voice of God, either by the continual
Noiſe and Throng of Worldly Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or by conſtant Diverſions to falſe
Pleaſures, and vain Entertainments of
Fancy, which ſo poſſeſs their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that they quickly expel all pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Thoughts; it is no Wonder, that
the Holy Spirit, being often reſiſted
doth at leaſt leave ſuch men to walk
on ſtill in their evil ways, and to die
and periſh in their Sins. But if we be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106810:22"/>
willing and obedient, under the Power
and Conduct of Gods Spirit working
in us; if we hearken to his Dictates,
and comply with his Motions, he will
ſtill come in to our Aſſiſtance with
greater and greater Aids,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 58.</note> and we may
be aſſured, that <hi>our Labour ſhall not be
in vain in the Lord.</hi> If we will cooperate
with the Grace of God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> 
               <hi>his Grace ſhall
be ſufficient for us.</hi> If we will do our
Parts towards the making us holy and
happy, God will certainly do His. If
we uſe our ſincere endeavour, that is,
if we do what we can towards it,
(and none can ſay, that they cannot
do that) God will infallibly bleſs our
Endeavours, and make them proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and ſucceſsful. So great is our
Encouragement to <hi>work out our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12, 13.</note>
although we are to do it <hi>with
fear and trembling, when it is God that
worketh in us both to Will and to Do
of his good pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe there are not ſo many
of thoſe, who are kept off from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Reformation through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of Succeſs, as there are of thoſe,
who continually delay this neceſſary
Work upon a bold Preſumption, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106810:23"/>
they can do it at any Time when they
will; the Remainder of my Diſcourſe
ſhall be ſpent in the Conſideration of

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The onely Time for Repentance
and Reformation is Now, the Preſent
Time; and 'tis of infinite Concern that
we enter upon it without delay, leſt
we for ever loſe the Opportunity
of Doing it.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Now is the accepted Time,

               <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note> No other
Time is ours, but the preſent; We can
no more command the future, than
recal what is paſt. And therefore it
was good Advice, which a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
gave his Scholar, that he ſhould
repent one day before he died, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that he ſhould do it that very
day, becauſe he had no Aſſurance of
another. He that doth not preſently
return from the Paths of Sin, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the next Step be beyond all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of Retreat. He that adjourns
the Amendment of his Doings to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Day, may within a few Moments
be cut off from all further acting in this
Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:106810:23"/>
And yet, how ſecurely do men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their Repentance and Reformation
from Time to Time, as if they were the
abſolute Lords and Maſters of Time, to
recall it or prolong it, as they pleaſe. Of
theſe Perſons we may obſerve three
Sorts.</p>
            <p>Some put off this Work to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
End of their Days, walking in the
Counſel of the Ungodly all their lives,
and yet hoping to die the Death of
the righteous.</p>
            <p>Others think, their old Age will
be ſoon enough to become ſerious
and penitent, wiſe and religious.</p>
            <p>Others deſign to defer their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
only to the next more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Opportunity, when they hope
to have better Leiſure for it.</p>
            <p>I wiſh it were as eaſie, effectually
to diſſuade theſe Perſons from ſuch
Delays, as it is to diſcover the great
and preſent Danger of the leaſt of them.
As for the firſt, The putting off Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to the Time of Sickneſs and
the Approaches of Death, this is a moſt
unreaſonable Preſumption and hardly
differs from perfect Madneſs. For a
Death-bed Repentance is a Thing ſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106810:24"/>
very uncertain, whether it will prove
Sincere and acceptable to God, that
there cannot be a more prodigious Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than to commit an Eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to ſuch an infinite Hazard. What
Aſſurance can there be of any ones
Sincerity, who delays his Return to
God, till at the very laſt he be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to it, by the Exigence of his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Condition? 'Tis to be feared, he is
not a free and ingenious, but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated,
and very like to prove a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wretched and eternal Penitent
who with much Grief and Sadneſs
forſakes his evil Ways, when he can
walk in them no longer; who begins
to amend, when the Seaſon of Sinning
is over; and to caſt out his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>uſts, when
Nature it ſelf doth it, whether he will
or no: For although he love his Sin
never ſo paſſionately, he muſt now
leave them; and although he hath ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
God and Goodneſs all his days, he
muſt now fly to them, or elſe be daſhed
upon everlaſting Miſery.</p>
            <p>When a man is tumbling off from
the World, and ſinking towards the
Bottomleſs Pit; it is no wonder, he
ſhould catch at God. Being arrived at
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106810:24"/>
the <hi>Non <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltra</hi> of his Evil Ways, at
the Chambers of Death and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs
of Hell, it is no ſtrange thing,
that he ſhould ſtop his carreer, and
begin to give back. When he ſtands
upon the Brink of the deep and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Gulph of Tophet, ſees the Mouth
of the Infernal Furnace opened to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, ſmells the Brimſtone, hears
the noiſe of the Damned, and begins
to be ſinged with the Flames; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſuppoſed that he ſhould leap
in without any Reluctancy. No, no,
having ſo near a Proſpect of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Ruine, the natural Deſire of Self-preſervation
will cauſe him to try his
utmoſt, whether there be any poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Eſcape? Now he will cry aloud
to God for Mercy, make great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
of the Evil of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ways, high Profeſſions of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to return from them, and ſtrong
Reſolutions to devote unto God a
Thouſand Lives, if he had them to
give.</p>
            <p>But it is a great Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any thing of Grace or
Goodneſs in all this Repentance, which
is extorted from the dying Sinner, by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106810:25"/>
ſuch a preſſing Neceſſity. This Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
ſo haſtily brought forth in the
very laſt Extremity, muſt needs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

wither before it grows up. Moſt even
of its faireſt Appearances do undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
miſcarry, and tho' in regard of
their Vehemency, they are called Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeekings of God, yet being ſo late
in reſpect of the Time, when they
commence, they are as it were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the Triumphs of the Juſtice
and Indignation of God, who laughs
at the Calamity of thoſe, who in their
Health and Proſperity <hi>have ſet at

            <p>And what if there be ſome Hopes,
that this late Repentance may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
prove to be of the right Kind,
and Effectual to Salvation? Let us

have this great Work to do at

out few, who in their ſerious Thoughts
do really deſign and forecaſt a dying
Repentance. No, although men will
not yet return from their evil ways,
they intend not to run on ſo far,
until they come to the very Brink of
Deſtruction. They reſolve to ſtop in
good time, as they think, and while
they may retreat with Safety. When
the young Man hath rejoyced a little
longer in his Youth, and walked in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106810:26"/>
the ways of his heart, and in the ſight

            <p>But art thou ſure, O fooliſh Sinner,

how ſuddenly mayſt thou be arreſted
by the cold Hands of Death, even in
the Heat of thy Youth, when thou
leaſt thinkeſt of ſuch a Thing? The
moſt flouriſhing Vigour and Strength
is liable to innumerable Dangers, and
may be conſumed in a Moment. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
men are taken away without
any Warning, in the midſt of their
Pleaſures and Enjoyments; ſo that
none can be certain of long Life; and
none are more unlikely to attain it,
than thoſe who moſt expect it; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when ſuch Expectation is uſed
as an Encouragement to delay Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Such Preſumptuous Sinners may
very juſtly provoke God to blaſt their
vain Hopes with a ſudden Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
When the Rich man in the
Goſpel, having laid up much Goods,
promiſed himſelf many years to enjoy
them, how ſharply and ſuddenly was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106810:26"/>
he both confuted and confounded,
with that bitter and ſurprizing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 18, 19.</note>
               <hi>Thou Fool, this night ſhall thy
Soul be required of thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe men eſcape the various
Accidents of an untimely Death, and
have their Lives prolonged to many
years; yet if they run thorow all the
Stages of their youth in a Wicked
Courſe, and never ſtop till Gray Hairs
overtake them; if they forſake not
their Sins, while they have Strength
to commit them, but follow their
Luſts, until a decrepit Age puts out
their Fire; the Repentance of ſuch old
Sinners may be very doubtful, whether
it be ſincere and acceptable to God,
as well as that of the Death-bed Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 14.</note>
               <hi>He, that hath had a Male in
his flock, and yet hath kept for God
onely a corrupt thing, will hardly eſcape
the Curſe of the Deceiver.</hi> There is
but little Hope, that God ſhould be
pleaſed with that man, who never draws
nigh to him, until the years draw
nigh in which himſelf hath no pleaſure,
who comes with the very Ruines of
Nature, with a ſhatter'd Underſtanding,
a crazy Body, feeble Limbs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106810:27"/>
Senſes, preſenting himſelf a rotten
and unſavoury Sacrifice; like that old
decrepit Mimick at <hi>Rome,</hi> who being
grown out of date, and ſlighted by
the People, made his Recourſe to the
Capitol, and there acted his Part as
well as he could, before the Image of
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the reſt of their Gods, as
if they would accept what Men had
deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>But perhaps we do not intend ſo
unworthily to requite the Author and
Preſerver of our Lives, by pouring out
unto him only the Dregs and Lees of
them. Neither will we ſo improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
adjourn the Care of our Souls
to thoſe evil Days, when we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bear the Infirmities of the Body.
We will repent, and ſerve God, and
reform our ſelves very ſpeedily. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we deſire that this Work may be
poſtponed a little while, until we have
a more convenient Seaſon when we
hope to be in a better Temper for
it.</p>
            <p>And do we onely hope? Alas! a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!
if we cannot infallibly foretel,
that ſuch a fitter Opportunity and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Diſpoſition will both together
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106810:27"/>
happen to us, we ſtill run a great

               <note place="margin">Pro. 27. 1.</note> 
               <hi>when we know not what a day

may never be brought forth: For
who can tell, whether the Sun may
live to make another Day? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the next Night may not cloſe
his Eye, bury him in Darkneſs, and
hang the World in Mourning at his
Funeral? Or if he ſhine forth again,
we may not live to ſee his Light. There
is no future Time that we can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
promiſe our ſelves, no, not that
of which we have the neareſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
Perhaps this very Time is our
laſt Opportunity, and if we let it ſlip,
'tis irrecoverable. For ought we know
our eternal State in Happineſs or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
may depend upon our well or
ill employing the few Hours that are
left of this very Day: And theſe are
paſſing from us with a ſwift and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
Motion; one of them is gone
while I have been ſpeaking to you,
and the reſt will follow apace. And
although, when this Day is ſpent, we
may poſſibly have many more to come,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106810:28"/>
yet all the moments of our Time are
winged, and will continually fly away
like an Eagle, or Poſt, or Ship, or
like an Arrow that leaves no Path. So
that unleſs we be very watchful, and
take a ſtrict Account of them, they
will ſlip from us and be utterly loſt.
And if we careleſsly or wilfully loſe
thoſe pretious Moments, which now
offer themſelves to us, it is much to
be feared, that we ſhall ſtill do ſo with
the next, and the next, and the next
until all our Time be expired.</p>
            <p>If we be unwilling to reform to day
we have no Reaſon to imagine, that
we ſhall be more willing to do it to
morrow. The longer men walk in
their evil ways, the more ſtrongly are
they inclined to continue in them
and the Difficulty of forſaking them
grows greater and greater by every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay;
their vicious Habits are ſtill more

and Loyalty, the Fear of God,
and the Fear of the King do very well
conſiſt together. <hi>Solomon</hi> exhorts to

hath alſo done the ſame, in almoſt the

what God hath joyned, let not vain Man

Heads of our ſeparating Factions cannot
ſeparate theſe one from the other. They
cannot indeed break off one Link from

            <p>We ſee here Loyalty to our Prince
is a thing commanded by God himſelf
together with Piety and Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
himſelf; yea and commanded in
the very next place to it; ſo that the
one is a part, an inſeparable part, a
very conſiderable part of the other. And
it follows from hence by apparent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
that mens Diſloyalty is a clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:106810:32"/>
Indication of their Irreligion. If they
fear not the King, they fear not God.
<hi>If any man ſeem to be religious and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth
not his Tongue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 26.</note> from <hi>ſpeaking evil

on the other ſide, if any man ſeem to
be loyal; if he profeſs the moſt awful
Veneration, the moſt dutiful Affection
to the King, yet, if he be void of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
his Allegiance is very uncertain.
He that is a bold Rebel againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and a falſe Traytor to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
is not like to be true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to his Prince. He may indeed be
Loyal for a Time, ſo long as his
Intereſt or his Humour inclines him to it,
but when he hath an Opportunity to
rebel with advantage, all his Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
will be caſt off.</p>
            <p>Here alſo we may perceive, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the preſerving a due Fear and
Reverence towards God and the King,
how neceſſary it is, that People ſhould
be forewarned of ill men, that they

            <p>And ſince both they and their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices
ſhall be purſued with Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance;
ſince none can tell what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Chaſtiſements a Provoked God,
and an angry Prince, may prepare for
them, it cleary follows, that thoſe who
joyn with the Seditious, are very ill

Self-Preſervation, while to prevent ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
and fictitious Dangers, they
throw themſelves into real and certain
Miſery.</p>
            <p>But to come to a more diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of each Particular obſerved
in the Text; I begin with the firſt,
the Exhortation to Religion, <hi>My Son,
fear thou the Lord.</hi> Of which Fear I
ſhall briefly conſider,

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, As for the Nature of the Fear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
we owe to God, it is not a ſlaviſh
Dread, joined with Anguiſh, Hatred,
and Deſpair; but a filial Reverence,
mix'd with Hope and Love. It is ſuch
an awful Apprehenſion of Gods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Greatneſs in himſelf, and his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Dominion over us, as is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a delightful Senſe of the
tranſcendent Goodneſs of his Nature,
and his admirable Kindneſs to us.</p>
            <p>If we could behold nothing in God
but irreſiſtible Power, ſoveraign Will,
and Severities of Juſtice, our caſe would
be like that of the Devils, our Fear
would then be nothing but pure Dread
and Horror, and the only Product of
our Faith would be <hi>to make us trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 19.</note>
But although the Majeſty of God
Almighty hath ſuch an overpowring
Glory in it,<note place="margin">Iſay. 6. 2, 3.</note> as dazles and confounds all
Mortal Creatures, <hi>and makes the very
Seraphims cover their Faces,</hi> yet ſince
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106810:34"/>
the aſtoniſhing Terror of it is allayed
and mitigated by his Goodneſs, and
ſince we believe him to be the Lord
God merciful and gracious, that Fear,
which we are to have of him,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 7.</note> is not
pure ſolitary Fear, but Reverence, or
Veneration, which ſuffers Love to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But then Secondly, as for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of this Reverential Fear, they
ought to be the higheſt and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
that the Soul of man is capable
of. The very higheſt Meaſures of Fear
are moſt due, moſt fit to be payed to
Gods abſolute Soveraignty over us,
and lower meaſures can never ſecure
our Obedience to him.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram.</hi>
               </note> For (if I may
take the liberty to borrow ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of this from a late excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Divine) ſuppoſe we fear any Thing
or Perſon in all the World more than God,
then when ever there happens a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
between the Fear of that Thing,
or that Perſon, and the Fear of God,
the greater Fear will overcome the
leſs, and ſo cauſe a Neglect or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation
of our Duty to him. But where
the Fear of God is predominant, there
it will ſecure our Duty, there it will
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106810:34"/>
be attended with ſincere Obedience.</p>
            <p>And this in the Third Place, is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
natural and proper Effect of ſuch a Fear,
If our Fear of another be in any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
degree, it will command and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
from us the ſame degree of Care
and Study, to ſerve and pleaſe the
Perſon feared. Fear implies an Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of Danger, and Danger, ſo far
as 'tis apprehended, will ſo far excite
us to uſe and employ the beſt Means
we can for our Preſervation.</p>
            <p>If we chuſe to diſobey God, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we do not fear his Threatnings;
and if they are not feared, it is becauſe
they are either not believed, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.
But the clear and firm Belief,
joyned with the ſerious conſideration, of
the Miſeries threatned to Diſobedience,
cannot but reſtrain and deter us from it.
We cannot indulge our ſelves in Sin, unleſs
we enjoy ſome Pleaſure in it; and we can
enjoy no Pleaſure in it, unleſs we forget
or disbelieve the everlaſting Puniſhments,
which Almighty God hath prepared for it.
While men have real and ſettled Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of thoſe Puniſhments, and while
the Remembrance of them, keeps them
under the Awe of Fear and Dread, their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106810:35"/>
Sins will appear ſo grievous to them,
that they will be forced to abſtain from
them for their own Eaſe and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>And if the Fear of God be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
as it is a filial Reverence compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with Love, it will be much more
powerful to move and excite Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to him. Reverence willingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
readily pays, and chearfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
what was forced and conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by meer Fear. If Awe and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
be united in a devout Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the God whom we ſerve, his
Service, which before was a Yoak and
a Burden, then becomes perfect Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
ſo pleaſant and ſo natural to us
that to refuſe it will be an Extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our own Joys, a Reſiſting o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

our own Deſires, and a Violence to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
A man, that highly reveres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
is as much inclined to pleaſe him
as he is to pleaſe himſelf, and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to offend him, as he is to wound
his own Breaſt.</p>
            <p>Obedience therefore is an Inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

our Religion. We all profeſs Religion,
and the Fear of God, we all pretend
the higheſt Awe and Reverence to his
divine Majeſty; But do we ſincerely
endeavour to ſerve and pleaſe him?
Are we guilty of no wilful diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
no choſen and deliberate viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his holy Laws? If we indulge
any of theſe, the true Fear of God is
not in us.</p>
            <p>For it is, fourthly, to be noted, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
theſe are the Contraries and Oppoſites
unto this Fear. All wilful and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
Sins are perfectly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to it. Theſe are Affronts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
bold and Impudent Practices,
which carry the Marks of great Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
clearly written upon their Brow.
When men deliberately chuſe to do thoſe
things, which they plainly ſee and know
to be contrary to the Divine Laws,
this is a manifeſt Diſcovery, that there
is no Fear of God before their eyes.
Let us therefore prove the truth of
our Religion, by the ſincerity of our
Obedience; particularly by our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to thoſe Commands of God,
which require us to be Loyal to our
Prince. That we may fully ſhew, what
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106810:36"/>
an Awful Senſe we have of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and Soveraignty of the moſt high
God, both in our Words, and in our
Actions, let both our Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
declare, how much we revere his
Power and Authority, not onely in
himſelf, but in thoſe alſo whom he hath
ſet over us.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And ſo I come to the ſecond part
of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Advice, wherein we are
admoniſhed unto the Fear of God, to
ſubjoyn the Fear of the King, who is
Gods Vicegerent. Of which I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in the ſame Method, as I have done
of the former, by conſidering its
<list>
                  <item>Nature,</item>
                  <item>Degrees,</item>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, As for the Nature of the Fear,
which we owe unto the King, 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much of the ſame nature, with
that Fear which is due to God himſelf,
onely 'tis inferior and ſubordinate to it.
For Kings are honoured in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with the adorable Name of God.
And the Laws of <hi>England</hi> looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106810:36"/>
the King as a God upon Earth,
do attribute unto him in ſome Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
diverſe Excellencies, that belong
properly to God alone; ſuch as are
a kind of Omnipotency in raiſing men
from Death to life, by pardoning
whom the Law hath condemned; a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Omnipreſency, by his numerous
Officers, who every where repreſent
him; and little leſs than an Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and an abſolute Perfection of
Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs: For our
Law will have no Error, no Injuſtice,
no Folly, no Imperfection whatſoever to
be found in the King.</p>
            <p>The Fear therefore which we owe
to our dread Soveraign, even like that
which we render to the divine Majeſty,
is a moſt profound Reverence for, an high
Eſteem of, and a moſt humble and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Affection unto, his Sacred Perſon
and Authority. It is a filial Fear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of Dread and Love: For the
King is the Father of our Country, by
whoſe Providence and Protection, we
are ſupported and defended, by whoſe
vigilant Care and Conduct we quietly
enjoy all that we poſſeſs. Of this (as
St. <hi>Jerom</hi> hath obſerved) even the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106810:37"/>
were ſo ſenſible,<note place="margin">Hieron. l. 9. in Ezek.</note> that it was a
conſtant Cuſtom among them, to call
all their Princes by the name of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi>
which ſignifies both Father and
King. And it was the Promiſe of God
to his Church, that in the Times of
the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Iſay. 49. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Kings ſhould be her nurſing
Fathers, and Queens her nurſing Mothers.</hi>
Which great Bleſſing hath been, and is,
moſt viſibly enjoyed by us in this
Nation, as much as by any People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Heaven.</p>
            <p>Since then by being born the Kings
Subjects, we have the Happineſs to be
his Children, the very law of Nature
doth oblige us, to pay him all the Aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
and Affection, and Duty of
Children.<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>If I be a Father</hi> (ſaith God)
<hi>where is mine Honour? If I be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
where is my Fear?</hi> Now the King
next and immediately under God, is
the great and common Father, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Lord and Maſter of us all.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And therefore, ſecondly, The Degrees
and Meaſures of Honour and Fear,
which are due to the King are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
higheſt, and the greateſt, next unto
thoſe that are due to God himſelf. The
ſupreme Power and Authority under
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106810:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God, being lodged in the ſacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Soveraign Prince, he may
juſtly demand the ſupreme Honour.
Within his own Dominions he is only
leſs and lower than God, he is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and higher than all Ranks and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Men. Yea all the States of
the Realm joyned together, all the
Nobles and Commons, and the whole
Body of the People have not a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Authority equal to his. All
his Subjects, whether Publick Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
or private men, not only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
and apart, but joyntly and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
are under his Command. For
otherwiſe, he would not be the King
of a Kingdom, or a Political Society,
united under one Form of Government,
but only a King of ſingle men ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
taken, and ſo he would be a
ſtrange kind of Chimerical and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Prince, a King of nothing but
a Rope of ſands.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>St. Peter,</hi>
Chap. 2. ver. 13 and 14. that great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
makes this plain Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
our Subjection to the King, and
to all other Magiſtrates, whether ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
collectively or diſtributively, We
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106810:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are to ſubmit to the King as Supreme, to
all others as his Officers and Delegates
Sent and Commiſſioned by him; all of
them together, as well as each of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
having received all their Power and
Authority from him, and he having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his from God alone.<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 2. 4.</note> For the King is
no Subſtitute of the People but the Miniſter
of God, and his Power is the Ordinance
of God.</p>
            <p>This is the Voice of Scripture and
of Reaſon, and this I may with the
greateſt Confidence, becauſe I can with
the ſtrongeſt Evidence affirm; it being
not only the unanimous Opinion
of all the Wiſeſt Politicians, and Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the World, but alſo the Catholick
Doctrine of the Chriſtian Church for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundreds of years together, that a
Monarch or Soveraign in his own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
hath no Superior, but <hi>God Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed it would be very ſtrange,
if any conſidering men ſhould think
otherwiſe: For it is a manifeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to be a Soveraign or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Prince, and to have a Superior.
Thoſe Kings, who have any Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
them, are only titular, not real
Kings. The Soveraignty is always lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106810:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where there is the higheſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
And according to the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of our Nation, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
in the King, for the Lords
both Spiritual and Temporal, together
with all the Commons aſſembled in
Parliament, do by a Solemn Oath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the King to be Supreme,
and themſelves to be his Subjects;
and they have in publick Statutes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
declared, the ſole Supreme
Command and Government of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,
ever to be, and to have been,
by the Law of <hi>England</hi> the undoubted
Right of his Majeſty, and his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors;
and that both or either Houſes
of Parliament cannot, nor lawfully may
raiſe or levy any War, offenſive or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive,
againſt his Majeſty his Heirs
and lawful Succeſſors. Neither can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Laws or Statutes be made by them,
but onely ſuch as the King approves.
Neither is the King accountable to them,
or to any other, or liable to be puniſhed by
them or by any other, beſides God.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Eſſentials of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or ſupreme Power, to have the
ſole Power of the Sword, to have the
Legiſlative Power, to have a Power
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106810:39"/>
which is irreſiſtible and unaccountable,
and no way ſubject to the coercive
Authority of any other. Every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and Imperial Soveraign hath all
theſe? And that we are under ſuch a
Soveraign, the whole Parliament did
acknowledge in the 24. <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 12. in
which it was Reſolved, That by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Authentick Hiſtories and Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
it is manifeſtly declared and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
that this Realm of <hi>England</hi> is
an Empire, and ſo hath been accepted
in the World, governed by one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Head and King, having Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Royal Eſtate of the Imperial
Crown of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Kings Majeſty being therefore
the only Supreme Governour in his
Dominions, next under God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
full, perfect, and entire Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Authority from God alone,
which no other Magiſtrates have, but
by Emanation from him, ought to be
revered by us, with the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Awfulneſs and Veneration, that
can juſtly be paid to any Perſon or
Power upon Earth. The Fear and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
we owe to him is greater than
we owe to any other, and is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106810:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
greateſt that can poſſibly be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
except only that Divine Honour and
Adoration, which is peculiar to the Deity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Awful Fear of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Prince, if it be really within
us, will have the very ſame Effect that
the Fear of God hath. It will produce
a moſt humble and loyal Submiſſion, a
moſt faithful and dutiful Obedience to
him. We ſhall execute his Commands
with Chearfulneſs, and bear with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
what he inflicts upon us. We
ſhall carefully endeavour to obſerve
and keep all his juſt Laws, that is to
ſay, all thoſe which are not contrary
to the Laws of God. And if it ſo
happen, that we cannot comply with
his Injunctions, by Reaſon of their
Repugnancy to the Divine Commands;
then we ſhall meekly and quietly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Penalties that enſue ſuch
non-complyance. There is but one
only caſe, wherein a good and loyal
Subject, who duly fears and honours
his Prince, will refuſe to obey him,
and that is, when ſuch Obedience will
by no means conſiſt with his Obedience to
God; then indeed he will obey God
rather than Man, becauſe he fears God
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106810:40"/>
more than any mortal Man, more
than the greateſt Monarch in the
World. But there is no Caſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
wherein he dareth, either to
reſiſt or reproach the Perſon or the
Authority of the King, or to offer
any Indignity to him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For in the fourth and laſt Place, it
is to be remembred, that all Acts of
wickedly preſumptuous Diſobedience,
all Oppoſitions by Force of Arms, all
reviling Expreſſions, and all manner of
Affronts are the moſt manifeſt Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
to the awful Fear of Soveraign
Majeſty. <hi>Where the Word of a King
is, there is Power,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 4. But if his
Word be ſlighted, and his Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed,
he is not honoured as a King.
<hi>Who may ſay unto him, what doeſt thou?</hi>
None ſurely can without great irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
<hi>Is it fit to ſay to a King, thou
art Wicked, or to Princes, ye are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi>
Job. 34. 18. No, it is very unfit,
it is one of the higheſt Inſtances of
Impudence, Rudeneſs, and Unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.
It is ſuch Behaviour as doth
no way conſiſt with the Deference,
Obſequiouſneſs, and profound Lowlineſs
which ought to be in Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:106810:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But what is it then, to take Arms
againſt him? Is it not plainly a fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt God, whom the King
repreſents, and with whoſe Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he is inveſted, <hi>Prov. 30. 31. A King</hi>
(like God) is one, <hi>againſt whom there
is no riſing up;</hi> No, not upon any
pretence whatſoever, without open
Perfidiouſneſs and Rebellion; of which
when any are guilty, they not only
affront their Prince, and contemn his
Laws and Government; they not
only act contrary to their Duty and
Allegiance, but they totally caſt off
the very State, and Quality, and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Subjects; yea, they are ſuch
Monſters of Men as do in a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
renounce humane Nature, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Civility; They are as natural
Brute beaſts, made to be taken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
So St. <hi>Peter</hi> deſcribes them,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10, 12.</p>
            <p>If we have therefore any Fear of
God or the King, if we have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to Religion or Loyalty, Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or Civility, we will abhor the
thoughts of ever joyning with ſuch
ſalvage, untamed, ungovernable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
ſuch Wolves and Tygers in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106810:41"/>
Shape as Rebels and Traitors are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Yea if we deſire to keep our ſelves
out of danger, we will have nothing
to do with any of the Friends or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents
of ſuch ill men, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
factious Deſigners, who do more
remotely attempt to deſtroy the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by introducing the Changes
and alterations of it. Which brings me to</p>

It is a Monarchy, and the beſt

We have been under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Kings, beyond the utmoſt
Records of all Hiſtory. Of Kings we
may juſtly boaſt, more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nation in the World: For it was

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106810:43"/>
under the ſame good Conduct of Kings,
that the true Chriſtian Reformed Religion
hath been hitherto preſerved among us.</p>
            <p>Shall we then be ſo unwiſe, as to
hearken to the Antimonarchical Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
of thoſe reſtleſs Demagogues, who
would alter and change, ſubvert and
deſtroy this moſt excellent this moſt
ancient, Form of Government? And what
if ſome Men, will not, or cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
that our Government deſerves
to be thus extolled? What if they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
this Conſtitution to be none of
the beſt? Yet every plain Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
may underſtand, That the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
of a Change are unſpeakable. A
Change of Government cannot ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
be introduced without a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and all the fatal Conſequences that
attend it; a Rebellion which commonly
begins with factious Combinations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Pretence of Defending Religion, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and Property; proceeds by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Force, and all the Ways of ſecret
Stratagem or open Aſſault; and ends in
Blood and Slaughter, Spoil and Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation,
Rapine and Plunder, Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Sacriledge; a Rebellion, I ſay
which, if proſperous and ſucceſsful, make
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106810:43"/>
a great Change indeed, overturns all
Order, and Rule, and licenſes all the
Injuſtice in the World; lays the Reins
upon mens necks, and takes off the
Reſtraints of their Appetites; throws
down the Fences of Law, and leaves
all open to the Incurſions of Violence;
gathers mens Luſts into a common
Storm, and fills all things with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and Confuſion; breaks up the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the Earth and lets in a kind
of Hell upon us. All theſe dire Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Subverting the Government
this Nation hath ſadly felt; and if
we took any Notice of the Black and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Day in the laſt week,<note place="margin">Januar. 30.</note> they muſt needs
at this Time be freſh in our Memories.</p>
            <p>But perhaps all this doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the men that are given to
Change. The ſeditious Incendiaries care
not, although the whole Kingdom be
in a Flame, if they can but warm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at the Fire; and at the End of
all this Blood-ſhed, Ruine, and Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation,
they expect nothing leſs than
the rich Spoils of a happy Victory, and
the Glory of Triumph. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

And their Puniſhment is as ſignal as
their Villany. They reſiſt the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

worthy of God.</p>
            <p>Every Age hath afforded Examples of
this; but I will only inſtance in the
Judgments, which followed the firſt
notorious Sedition that happened in
World, and the laſt great Rebellion in
our own Nation.</p>
            <p>That firſt Sedition (of which we have
a large and full Account in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Chapter of <hi>Numbers</hi>) was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of <hi>Corah</hi> and his Accomplices
againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of aſſerting the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the People, in Oppoſition to
the arbitrary Government of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
whom they accuſed of Tyranny (as
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106810:45"/>
               <hi>Joſephus</hi> expreſly ſaith, agreeably to
what the Scripture it ſelf doth imply)
and the freeing themſelves from the
Incroachments upon their ſpiritual Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
by the Uſurpations of <hi>Aaron</hi>
and the Prieſthood. Which ſpecious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
drew into the Conſpiracy a great
Number of Conſiderable Perſons, even
two hundred and fifty Princes of the
Aſſembly, famous in the Congregation,
<hi>Men of Renown.</hi> But notwithſtanding
their Popular Pretences, (which were,
for ſubſtance, the very ſame, that gave
the firſt Riſe and Birth to our late
Confuſions;) and although they acted
under ſome ſhew of Authority, when
ſuch an Aſſembly of Princes and Great
Men joyned with them; (as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
alſo endeavoured to juſtifie their
Proceedings, by the pretended Power
of a Parliament;) although, I ſay, they
had ſuch fair Colours, for what they
did, and ſuch Eminent Men on their
ſide, they were made to ſuffer the juſt
deſert of their Sin. Both Earth and
Heaven conſpired to puniſh them, and
their Deſtruction was no leſs terrible
than ſudden. They had diſturbed the
Earth by their Faction, and the Earth
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106810:45"/>
as it were moved with Indignation againſt
them, rent aſunder, and opened its
Mouth to ſwallow thoſe in its Bowels,
who were unworthy to live upon the
Face of it. When they had been divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the People, the very Ground di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
it ſelf under their feet, and breaks
into a Chaſm in the Place where they
ſtood, that they might go down quick
into the Pit of Deſtruction, Death and
the Grave both ſeizing them at once.
And thoſe two hundred and fifty of
the Seditious Incendiaries that offered
Incenſe, were as ſwiftly conſumed by
Fire from Heaven. So ſuitable were
their Puniſhments both to the Nature
and the Degree of their Crimes.</p>
            <p>And when the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> inſtead of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Duty by theſe dreadful Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
took upon them the next Day in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Inſurrection to juſtifie the Plea of
<hi>Corah,</hi> to own thoſe Rebels as the People
of the Lord, and to charge <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
as being guilty of their Blood; the Wrath
of God went out againſt them and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them, as in a moment, with ſuch a
quick diſpatch, that, although <hi>Aaron</hi>
with all poſſible Haſte made an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for them, there were deſtroyed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106810:46"/>
by the Plague, no leſs than Fourteen
thouſand and ſeven hundred.</p>
            <p>But to come to the Inſtance nearer
home, What, I pray were the Effects
of the late Rebellion in our Native
Land? Was it not in the Event moſt
pernicious and deſtructive to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
themſelves, at leaſt to the Chiefeſt
of them? Did not their Calamity ariſe
ſuddenly, ſo ſuddenly that themſelves
ſcarce ſore-ſaw it? Thoſe malignant
Comets, having blazed a little while,
quickly expired in Stench. Their Riſe
was ſudden and their Fall too. Their
reſtleſs Ambition made them violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
introduce a Change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but what a Change did them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
meet with, when they were
thrown down from the Top of all
their vain Falſe Glory, to be the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and the Hiſſing of the People?
They had divided the Kingdom, and
embroiled it in a Deſtructive War:
God therefore divided them among
themſelves, and made them their own
Scourges, like an Army of <hi>Philiſtines,</hi>
ſtill beating and threſhing down one
another, until the Reſtauration of his
ſacred Majeſty, when the Hand of God
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106810:46"/>
was illuſtriouſly viſible, both in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to the Throne of his Father,
and the principal Rebels and Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
to Publick Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Some indeed there were, who had
no ſmall ſhare in the Guilt, and yet
eſcaped the Puniſhment; But they may
thank their moſt Gracious and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Prince, whoſe matchleſs Clemency
hath been greater than the greateſt of
their Bloody Villanies. And after ſuch
a Pardon of ſuch Guilt, if any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of this Crown have a mind to
rebel again, let them take heed leſt
they ſin beyond all Poſſibility of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
and barr themſelves eternally,
not only from the Mercies of the King,
but alſo from the Mercies of God
Almighty.</p>
            <p>As for our ſelves, if we ſuſpect or
perceive any Factious Men to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
againſt the Government, let not
our Souls come into their Secret: Let
us not meddle in the leaſt with ſuch
Sons of <hi>Corah,</hi> except it be by all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means to detect, oppoſe, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs

them in their Curſed Attempts and
Machinations, unleſs we deſire to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106810:47"/>
fall with them, in their Ruine and
Calamity. But as it was Propheſied
by <hi>Hoſea</hi> of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
That after their Captivity they ſhould
return and ſeek the Lord their God
and <hi>David</hi> their King;<note place="margin">Hoſ. 3. 5.</note> ſtill, <hi>David</hi> their

we and our Poſterity may fear, and

and all his Lawful Succeſſors,

Pen of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Mouth of God.
<hi>For the tranſgreſſion of a Land, many
are the Princes thereof: But by a man of
underſtanding and knowledge, the State
thereof ſhall be prolonged.</hi> In which words
there lie before us theſe Four Obſervables.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a publick National Judgment
and that is the ill State of a Nation

Governours, when <hi>many are the
Princes thereof.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, the notorious Cauſe of ſuch

the Wickedneſs of a People, <hi>the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion

            </p>

            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:106810:50"/>
Fourthly, The principal means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſo great a Mercy is procured, and
that is the Wiſdom of the Monarch,
his <hi>underſtanding and knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
National Judgment, <hi>many Princes;</hi> by
which it is plain, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
Supreme or Soveraign Princes:
For many inferior Magiſtrates or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Governours, are at all times
neceſſary to every State and Kingdom,
even in their moſt peaceful and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
Condition. It is therefore the
multiplication of Soveraigns, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
here ſpeakes of; by many of whom
may be meant, either many lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns,
or many Uſurpers; both
which are publick Evils, although the
latter be the more ſignal Judgment.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, by Princes in the Text
we may underſtand lawful Soveraigns;
and of them there may be either many ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively,
or many at once. There may be
many ſucceſſively in a Monarchical State;
ſometimes by the very Nature of the
Conſtitution, as in an Elective Monarchy,
where the Crown is not inviolably fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in one Royal Family, and in the one

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106810:51"/>
conferred on various Perſons of divers
Families or different Lines, according
to the Will and Pleaſure of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.
This is an ill State in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Hereditary Monarchy. At the
Death of every Prince, 'tis ſubject to an
<hi>Interregnum,</hi> in which the whole Frame
of things may be unſettled; and every
new Election not only commits the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Affairs to untried hands,
but may alſo expoſe the Kingdom to
great Chages, and dangerous Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ariſing from the oppoſite Intereſts,
Affections, and Inclinations of various
Families, and conſequently of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as are choſen out of them.</p>
            <p>Indeed if it happen that the Elected
King be the Son of Nobles, as <hi>Solomon</hi>
ſpeaks, if he deſcended from the Sacred
Race of Kings, and hath been educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               </gap>
he hath not only the Title, Place, and
Office, but the real Majeſty and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
the God-like Spirit, the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Juſtice, and Clemency of a King
matters may go well while he Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
<hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Land, when thy
King is the Son of Nobles,</hi> Eccleſ. 10. 17.
But if it ſo fall out (as it often may i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

be choſen out of the meaneſt of the

never be happy under ſuch a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
For a Servant <hi>when he reigneth,
is one of thoſe three things, for which the
Earth is diſquieted, and one of the four,
which it cannot bear,</hi> Prov. 30. 21. 22.</p>
            <p>Sometimes alſo by the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Heaven, and by the Viſitation
of God, there may be many Princes
ſucceſſively even in an Hereditary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,

and blind and boiſterous Rabble, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their ſhare in the Government.</p>
            <p>I deny not that theſe Republicks are
lawful Powers in thoſe places where
by Divine permiſſion they have had a
durable continuance and eſtabliſhment.
Long Poſſeſſion may give them a Title,
and as bad as they are, Uſe and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
and the Situation of ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
may make them tolerable in ſome
few particular places.</p>
            <p>Neither will I ſay, that <hi>Solomon</hi> did
expreſly and deſignedly pronounce this
Sentence concerning them. The truth
is, they cannot boaſt of ſo great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.
It doth not appear, that any
ſuch Forms of Government had ever
been heard of in his Days. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
many in this Age, and in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have been ſuch fond Admirers of
Common-Wealths, I ſhall for their ſakes
enquire, whether theſe rare Models of
Government, although they do not fall
directly under <hi>Solomon's</hi> Cenſure, be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any better than the many Princes
in my Text are ſuppoſed to be? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be not, for the moſt part,

Heaven, <hi>for the tranſgreſſion of a Land?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they were generally ſo in their
Original, I think is not much to be
doubted. For what was it that brought
Republicks into the World? Was it not
Faction and Sedition? Were they not
all at firſt meer Uſurpations? Where
is then any People, Nation, or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
which was not anciently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Kings? We cannot ſuppoſe that
any was not, unleſs we will take upon
us (as ſome of our Republicans have
confidently done) to queſtion the truth
of all ancient Hiſtory.<note place="margin">Plato Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divivus. p. 27.</note>

infallible Story in the Writings of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
who had both the Power of a King,
and the Spirit of a Prophet, gives us
ſufficient poof thereof. And if we ſearch
after the firſt Riſe and Birth of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical
or Democratical States, we
ſhall conſtantly find upon Record, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106810:53"/>
they were the natural products of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs
and Rebellion.</p>
            <p>When men ſhook off their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to their Prince, and revolted from
that Eſtabliſhment, to which they were
born Subjects, then they Erected a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth
Thus the <hi>Roman</hi> Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
began by a <hi>Regifugium,</hi> the fickle
and inconſtant People changing the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Form of their Government, becauſe
of the particular miſcarriages of one of
their Governours. Thus the united
Netherlands upon their Defection from
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> made up a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of many Independent Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
joyning together of meer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
to keep themſelves from being
puniſhed, for rebelling againſt, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring
their rightful Prince. Thus the
<hi>Swiſs Cantons</hi> revolting from the Houſe
of <hi>Auſtria, Genoa</hi> from the Empire, and
<hi>Geneva</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſet up
for themſelves as Common-Wealths or
free States, as they love to be called,
caſting off their ancient, and for the moſt
part eaſie dependance upon their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Soveraigns, that they might aſpire
to the Name and Shadow of a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Freedom. And even the ſo much
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106810:54"/>
celebrated <hi>Venetians</hi> ſtole their Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
at firſt, taking advantage of the
common Fears and Diſorders, when <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
was alarm'd by the <hi>Hunns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is there any ſuch Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs
in Republicks, after they are
ſettled, as will make amends for the
badneſs of their Original. If we look
into their Adminiſtration, we ſhall find
them attended with ſo many and ſo
great Inconveniences, that the chief end
of Government, which is the publick
Peace and Happineſs, or the well being
of a Community, cannot be ordinarily
obtained by them.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more pernicious to any
Society, than Contention and Diſcord.
<hi>Can two walk together,</hi> ſaith God <hi>except
they be agreed?</hi> Amos 3. 3. And if Two
cannot, it is not to be expected that
Many ſhould. There can be no peace
without Agreement, and the Agreement
of many, if there be no Superior to
unite them, is almoſt impoſſible. As A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
is conſtantly attended with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
ſo is Polyarchy with Diviſion.</p>
            <p>Where there is a conſiderable number
of Men, that have an equal ſhare in the
Soveraign Power, there will be inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106810:54"/>
Diſcords, Jealouſies, and Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
iſſuing from their different Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and oppoſite Counſels, as to the
Conduct of State Affairs. And although
their Debates be ended by Majority of
Suffrages, their Animoſities, eſpecially
in the weaker ſide, will be the more
inflamed. For ſince all Men naturally
deſire to have their own advice fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
thoſe that are out-voted will be
apt to look upon themſelves as both
diſparaged and diſappointed, from whence
will ariſe Anger, Hatred, and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
which Paſſions, if there be oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
will break out into Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Inſurrections, to ſuppreſs and
ruine thoſe whom they could not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terballance.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſon why there are no
greater Tumults and Seditions in our
Modern Republicks, is becauſe being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
perpetually engaged, either as
Principals or Confederates in Forraign
Wars, the Factious Spirits have not
leiſure to quarrel at home. <hi>Pax tibi
Marte,</hi> which is the Motto of <hi>Venice,</hi>
may very well ſuit all the reſt of them;
For when they have no work cut out
for their Swords abroad, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106810:55"/>
running into Domeſtick Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and by theſe the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, might long ago have been
ruined, had it not been for the little
mixture of Monarchy, with which their
Conſtitutions are compounded; ſuch as
that of a Duke, or a State-holder, who
reduceth the Factions to ſome Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and keeps the State from a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
            <p>Neither are Republicks in leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from Foreign, than they are from
Inteſtine Enemies, which makes them
live in perpetual fears of Invaſion; and
being unable to defend themſelves, in
this caſe alſo they are beholden to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:
For the uſual Aſylum where
they take ſhelter, is under the Wing
of ſome Potent Neighbouring Prince,
whom they chuſe for their Protector.</p>
            <p>Beſides, nothing is of greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the good ſucceſs of arduous
Affairs, than Secreſie. But is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hope of ſecreſie, where there are an
hundred Ears to hear the Counſels, and
fifty Tongues to publiſh them; and
where ten or twenty of thoſe fifty (as
it uſually happens) diſſent from the
reſt? Will not theſe be hugely tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106810:55"/>
to revenge the neglect and refuſal
of their own Advice, by divulging the
moſt important Secrets of the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faction?</p>
            <p>And tho' there be ſometimes a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Acquieſcence, in the Opinion of the
Major part; yet the Debates and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations
among ſo many different
Judgments, are commonly ſo long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
that before they can arrive at
a Reſolution, many favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
for Action are irrecoverably
loſt, and their beſt Deſigns miſcarry
for want of timely Execution.</p>
            <p>But beyond all that hath been ſaid,
there is this great miſchief in every
Ariſtocratical or Democratical Common-Wealth,
that the many Princes or chief
Magiſtrates by which it is governed,
being only temporary Officers of no
long continuance, have a ſeparate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of their own, diſtinct from that
of the Publick; by which means they
will be very apt, to aim chiefly at their
own private advantage, in all their
publick Truſts, and may be ſometimes
ſo far corrupted, as to betray their
Country to a Foreign Power, when
ſufficient Aſſurance is given them, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106810:56"/>
they ſhall not only ſurvive the Fate of
the expiring Government, but enlarge
their Fortunes by its Diſſolution.</p>
            <p>A King and his Kingdom have but
one and the ſame inſeparable Intereſt.
If the Kingdom be ruined, the King
periſheth. But it is otherwiſe in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth,
where ſome that ſit at the
Helm of State,<note place="margin">See ſome of theſe, and diverſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of Republicks, more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Dr. <hi>Nalfon's</hi> Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of King and people <hi>Ch.</hi> 3.</note> may have the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
both to ſecure and to enrich
their own private Veſſel, by ſinking the
publick Bottom. Neither will they be
at all concerned for the loſs of their
ſhare in the Government of it, when
by ſelling that Power, which they muſt
ſhortly reſign, and bartering away the
publick Intereſt together with it, they
purchaſe a higher and a more durable
Grandeur, than otherwiſe they could
ever have obtained.</p>
            <p>And now let any one judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Form of Government, in which
many have a Copartnerſhip, be ſo great
a Happineſs to a People, as ſome have
pretended it to be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if by many Princes we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
many Uſurpers of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it will be much more evident
that they are the Rods, and Scourges of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106810:56"/>
Heaven, the Plagues and Judgments of
a provoked God, with which he Viſits
a ſinful People.</p>
            <p>Uſurpers are ſuch men as are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
born to Empire, nor legally cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to it, but being inſpired by inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Ambition, poſſeſs'd with unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Hopes, and mounted on the ſoaring
Wings of Arrogance and Preſumption,
raiſe themſelves with an inſuperable
boldneſs, and violently invade the Seat
of Majeſty.</p>
            <p>They acquire their Power by the
moſt wicked and unlawful means, and
by the ſame evil Arts keep and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it; by treaſonable Leagues and
Bonds of Iniquity, by Hypocriſie and
Diſſimulation, Perjury and Cruelty, Blood
and Slaughter, and the total ſubverſion
of all Lawful Government, Right and
Juſtice, Peace and Order.</p>
            <p>They inveigle the giddy Multitude
with ſpecious Declamations againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pretended miſcarriages in the whole
conduct of Publick Affairs; that by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
the wild Commotion of Popular
Fury, and the reſtleſs Ferment of blind
and bitter Zeal, they may have Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Tools ready whet and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106810:57"/>
for the great Work of a thorow
Reformation, that is to ſay, of hewing
down, and cutting in pieces, of pulling
up Root and Branch, whatever hath
not the luck to pleaſe them.</p>
            <p>They fill all places with falſe Fears
and groundleſs Jealouſies of Arbritary
Government, that when their ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and triumphant Rebellion hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned
their Rightful Prince, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
may Reign in his ſtead, with
the greateſt Heights of Arbitrarineſs.
And when they have Lorded and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized
a little while, others get up
and depoſe them. And theſe alſo, in
a ſhort time, are forced to give place
to ſtronger Rebels, and greater Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
perhaps to ſome of their own
Creatures and Servants, by whoſe help
themſelves were raiſed.</p>
            <p>Thus the Government of a Nation,
being once removed from its right Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
is toſs'd about from one to another,
and various Uſurpers ſucceſſively poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
themſelves of it, as this or that
Faction grows predominant. But O the
Inſolencies, the Oppreſſions, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,

Confuſions, the Crimes and Calamities
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106810:57"/>
of all ſorts, that ſuch a Land muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

of that People, where ſuch dire

How do <hi>they reel to and fro and

be the caſe of all that have any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
any Principles, any Faith, any

the glorious Titles of Patriots and
Protectors, thoſe bloody Murderers in
the room of Nurſing Fathers, thoſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous
Wolves in the Shepherd's place!
O the ſudden Convulſions, ſurprizing
Paroxyſms, inſupportable Agonies of
the Body Politick, when ſhe is forced
to be the Patient of ſuch cruel Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
who pretend to heal her Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
by giving her the wideſt and
deepeſt Wounds, and to reſtore her to
a ſound and healthful Conſtitution, by
drawing forth her very Heart-Blood
and vital Spirits!</p>
            <p>This! this is the lamentable State
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106810:58"/>
of a Nation, when Uſurpers, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Uſurpers have Dominion over her!
Of all This, the execrable Occaſion of
the preſent mournful Solemnity affords
the moſt convincing Proofs. Of all
This, our own Native Country had a
long, a ſad Experience, for neer twenty
years together. And although more
than twenty be paſt, ſince our happy
Deliverance from theſe Miſeries, and
the juſt Vengeance of Heaven upon the
Authors of them; yet we ſee the ſame
Faction begins now to lift up its head
again, the ſame Antimonarchical Spirit
is revived, and under the ſame Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
too, of ſecuring our Religion, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and Property, of keeping out
Popery, Slavery, and Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Witneſs the late horrid Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick
Conſpiracy againſt His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties

            <p>I never took delight in calling to

ſort of Men. Would to God they
might have been buried in the deepeſt
Oblivion, without any hope of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furrection.
But ſince the ſame Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of men, inſtead of forgetting the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106810:58"/>
Practice of them, are ſtill returning to
the ſame; and ſince we have ſtill cauſe
to humble our ſelves under the Hand
of God, which ſo ſeverely chaſtiſed us
by them; I muſt crave your Patience,
while I briefly reflect on the Plagues
and Miſchiefs of thoſe old Treaſons
and Uſurpations, that we may be the
more awakened, by all lawful means
vigorouſly to oppoſe the firſt beginnings
of any new ones.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt preſent you with
a diſmal Scene of things: For whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhall conſider our numerous Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
under the Infamous Reign of
our numerous Uſurpers, thoſe before
the Murder of the King, that horrid
Fact it ſelf, the very Center of all the
reſt, and thoſe that followed after, will
ſoon perceive, that the Flood-Gates of
Ruine were ſet wide open, and that
all manner of Confuſion and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
came in upon us with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming
Deluge.</p>
            <p>Our Uſurpers began their Tyranny,
as ſuch generally do, by a bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.
For Rebels and Uſurpers are of
the ſame Species; Rebels are Uſurpers
Militant, and Uſurpers are Rebels Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:106810:59"/>
As ſoon as the Faction of the long
Parliament departed from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to him, on whom all their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
depended, and inſtead of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
their humble Advice in dutiful
Counſels, endeavoured to obtrude their
imperious Dictates, by an overbearing
Force, our Land was immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
many Princes; one Lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,

            <p>Theſe heady Demagogues, after they
had reproached the Government in
contumelious Harangues, and injuriouſly
Impeached the Chief Miniſters of State,
that the moſt able and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
being removed, they might more
eaſily wound their Lord and Maſter;
after they had largly Remonſtrated the
Nations Grievances, among which they
reckoned all the Complaints that Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
with whom the eaſieſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is a Yoke and Bondage, could
frame or imagine; after they had thrown
down the Mitres, that the Crown might
fall with them; excluded the Biſhops
from their Rights of ſitting in the Houſe
of Lords, and affronted the King with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106810:59"/>
the higheſt Irreverences, animating the

Numbers to aſſault his Majeſty, with
their unreaſonable Demands and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
Petitions; until His Sacred
Perſon and Life being in danger, he
was forced to withdraw in his own

actually reſiſted the Ordinance of God,

Victory, and what was the bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
they purchaſed at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
of ſo much Blood and Treaſure?
They reformed the Church, by pulling
down her Walls and Pillars, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
her Lands, deſtroying her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
Veſtments, and Utenſils, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing
her Beauty, ſequeſtring her

away all Forms of Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and tolerating all Religions, or
rather, Irreligions, Schiſms, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.
They reformed the State by the

and exhauſting the Wealth of the
Kingdom, the Subverſion of the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Laws, the Violating thoſe

of Parliament, for which they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have taken Arms; the Caſhier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Peers of the Realm, and the
Ruine of the Monarchy. They brought
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106810:61"/>
us to a glorious Liberty indeed, when
the King and the Lords being laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
as uſeleſs, the Nations Ears were
nailed to the Door-poſts of the Houſe
of Commons, and when that Houſe
too, having Impriſoned or Excluded
the far greater and ſounder part of her

            <p>Theſe things happened to us before

then at the Perpetration of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
and unexampled Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
all manner of Sins and Miſchiefs
ſeemed to be as it were concentred
in one Point.</p>
            <p>That execrable Murder and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the moſt Sacred <hi>Britiſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of Glorious

that the inflamed Wrath of

was ſuch a Sin of this then Barbarous

Tears enough to lament and deplore.</p>
            <p>That a King ſhould be Tryed and
Sentenced in a Judicial manner, with
ceremonious Pomp, as a Capital Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
by the meaneſt of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
againſt all Laws Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,

Scaffold, neer the Gates of his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,

before the Sun at Noon Day,
before thouſands of his own Subjects,
before divers Foreigners of all Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106810:62"/>
Parricide, as hath been an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
Spectacle to the preſent Age,
and will be an incredible Hiſtory in
the future. In ſhort, that a King ſo
Wiſe and Juſt, ſo Pious and Virtuous,
One whoſe Life was the viſible Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
of the excellent Religion he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd;
whoſe Government by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy
of Goodneſs, made his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſeem to Reign with him; one
who was ſo great a Patren of the
Church, ſo tender a Father of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
ſhould be perſecuted and driven
out of the World, by his own rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Children, with all this helliſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency
and Indignity; after they had
moſt ſolemnly profeſſed, that they
would make him a Glorious King;
after he had moſt ſincerely endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make them a Happy People;
and after they had obtained from him
ſo large Conceſſions, as no King grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, as no Subjects before demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
I ſay, that men ſhould ever be ſo
wicked, as to act ſuch an ingrateful Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
among us; that God ſhould ever
be ſo angry, as to permit ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-whelming
Calamity to befall us,
this is a ſtrange, and a new thing in

the Earth, ſuch as our Anceſtors never
heard of, ſuch as I wiſh Poſterity may
never imitate.</p>
            <p>Thus they made their Soveraign a
Glorious King indeed, when they would
not have him to Reign over them,
when they would not ſuffer him to be
any longer, <hi>Rex Diabolorum,</hi> as the
King of <hi>England</hi> hath been ſometimes
called, and then truly was, but furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
removed him to a Celeſtial Throne,
among the bleſſed Saints and Angels.
Thus they effectually ſeparated him from
ill Counſellors, when they ſent him
to that High and Holy Place, where
'tis impoſſible there ſhould be any.
But that Angelical advancement, which
made his Martyrdom a Royal Triumph,
was the greater aggravation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicides
Diabolical Guilt;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> 
               <hi>And that far
more exceeding and eternal weight of
Glory,</hi> which turned his Loſs of three
Temporal Crowns into a light Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to himſelf, made his three Kingdoms
Loſs of ſo Glorious a Prince the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
Judgment upon them.</p>
            <p>Had our many Uſurpers, been only
the Authors of this one Miſchief, this
alone would have abundantly proved
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106810:63"/>
them, the great Plague of Heaven for
the Tranſgreſſion of our Land.</p>
            <p>But after and beſides this, behold a
long Train of direful Conſequences.
The King being Murdered, his only
lawful Succeſſor, the Heir apparent both
of his Virtues and his Kingdoms, was
forced to be an Exile for his own
ſafety, and all lawful Government was
baniſhed with him. Thoſe who had
the boldneſs to Arraign ſacred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
Majeſty, made no ſcruple to
paſs their unrighteous Sentence on the
moſt Innocent of the People. The Ax,
which had taſted Royal Blood, could
not afterwards be ſatisfied, without
frequent Sacrifices of the moſt Duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Subjects, whom the devouring Sword
had ſpared. And the truly Keepers
of our Liberties took care to ſecure
them, by making the whole Nation
but one great Priſon, and themſelves
the Jaylors.</p>
            <p>Theſe Birds of Prey began now to
divide the Spoil, beſtowing upon one
another the Lands of the Crown, the
Revenues of the Church, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
of Delinquents, as the Rewards of
their great Service, in delivering their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106810:63"/>
Country from one pretended Tyrant,
and ſetting up forty or fifty real ones
in his room. For we were now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
by a vile Remnant of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives,
who juſtly deſerved the Infamous
Name that was generally given them.</p>
            <p>And when theſe upſtart Muſhrom
Princes of the New Common-wealth
had pretty well blooded, and fleeced
the Nation; when they had Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
without any Law, Executed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Crime, and ſequeſtered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Mercy; until like the Locuſts
and Caterpillars, they hardly left any
thing green, and flouriſhing among
us; in a word, when they had done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing that was good in their own
Eyes, and bad in the Eyes of all the
World beſides; at length a leading Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their Tyrannical Juncto, who
alſo bore the greateſt ſway in their
Murdering Army, being a more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Impoſtor than the reſt, out-wits
them all, pulls them down, and Rules
by himſelf with as abſolute a Power,
as was ever aſſumed by the moſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Monarch.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Engliſh</hi> Grand Seignior ſet over
the Land a company of Baſhaws, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106810:64"/>
the Title of Major-Generals, who
in their reſpective Provinces, according
to the Command of their Imperious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
inſolently domineered over the
Nobility and Gentry, diſarming, deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating,
and baniſhing ſeveral miles from
<hi>London,</hi> all whom they pleaſed to call
Malignants, that is to ſay, all the Kings
Friends, that had ſurvived the ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Miſeries. The Power he gave
to theſe Decimators was great and
boundleſs, and their Proceedings were
purely Arbitrary, in Oppreſſing, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
and Spoiling; whereſoever they
ſuſpected any to be guilty of Loyalty,
taking from them yearly the Tenth
Penny, unleſs they bought off that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
vexation with a valuable Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
So that the Free People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were become as very Slaves as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that live under the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>And after this great Uſurper was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into another World, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the cruel and bloody Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
he exerciſed in this; we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
perpetual Confuſions, and various
Changes of Government and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours;
<hi>Britain</hi> ſeemed then no fixed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106810:64"/>
Iſland, but as it were a rolling Ship
in the boiſtrous Ocean, ſteered by no
Pilots, but the mutable and alternate
blaſts of contrary Winds; toſt up and
down from one Wave to another, and
made the ſport of the proud inſulting
Billows; until the miraculous Goodneſs
of Heaven ſettled us again upon our
Ancient Foundations, reſtored our Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Monarch, and Excellent Monarchy,
of which our great ſins had ſo long
deprived us.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come to the Second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in the Text, the cauſe of this
National Judgement, which is the ſame,
that is the cauſe of all other Publick
Judgments, even the publick Guilt, <hi>the

            </p>
            <p>It is the multitude of National Sins,
that introduceth the multitude of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.
If a People ſuffer under the
ſucceſſive Invaſions, numerous Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and unbounded Tyranny of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Princes; all this miſchief, whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
are the Inſtruments in bringing it

genuine Product of their own Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>God often permits the Hands of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106810:65"/>
to execute his Wrath upon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and makes the Wickedneſs of ſome
the Chaſtiſement of others. When his
Indignation is moved, by the provok-Impieties
of a ſinful Kingdom, and
when the time for Judgment is fully
come; he will no longer ſhelter it by
his Providence, from the Sons of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Blood; no longer reſtrain the
Tumults of the Rabble, and the Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

            <p>The Life and Safety of the King is
the Life and Safety of the People; their

to have only Breaſt-plates of Iron and

been as of many Horſes and Chariots,
running to the Battel, loudly proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Folly of their Wickedneſs, who deſire
and chuſe Gods Plagues, who contend
and wreſtle for the Vengeance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and will not be content without
it. We have lived in an Age, in which
men have Faſted and Prayed, and Fought
for the procuring of Divine Judgments,
for the ſubverſion of our Lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
the extirpation of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
tempered Monarchy, and the
ſetting up the Uſurping Powers of a
many-headed Democracy. We have
had Bon-fires in our Streets, and loud
Thanſgivings in our Pulpits, when the
deſired Calamities have been obtained;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106810:69"/>
when the raving Petitions of ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
Enthuſiaſts have in juſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
been granted them; yea ſome
of their Lay-Preachers ſolemnly praiſed
God for that very prodigious Sin and
Judgment, which was the cauſe of this
days Faſting and Humiliation. Such
was the infatuating perverſeneſs, the
ſenſeleſs extravagance, the impudent
wildneſs of their monſtrous Impiety!</p>
            <p>And is it not ſtrange, that even now,
after the Impoſtures of Religious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
have been ſo plainly detected, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all that our Eyes have ſeen, and
our Ears heard of the Miſeries and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
which Seditious Republicans
have brought upon us, Men ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the diſſolving the Ligaments of
the Monarchy a ſecond time, and the
opening a Door to let in another Scene
of numerous Uſurpers, to enſlave and
ruine us? That the Machinations of the
late Conſpirators had a direct tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
this way, needs no Proof. And all
Wiſe men can eaſily judge, whether the
cutting the great Cable that holds the
Government, or the violating the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Hereditary Right of Lineal
Succeſſion to this Imperial Crown, would
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106810:69"/>
not be like to have the very ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Effects?</p>
            <p>Will our Fears of our <hi>Roman</hi> Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
juſtifie a Contrivance, ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
contrary to Law and Equity, to
our moſt Solemn Oaths both of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
and Supremacy, and to thoſe
very Intereſts of Peace, and Religion,
which are ſuppoſed to be in danger?
Is not this the ready way, to introduce
Wars and Confuſions; in which we ſhall
have many Religions, without the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of any; in which we ſhall have
many Princes, and no Government,
but all contending for the Supremacy,
one to obtain his juſt Right, others to
acquire or to hold an unjuſt Poſſeſſion?
Is the imitating of the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſome of the worſt of their
wicked Practices a good Expedient to
keep out Popery? Or can this ſinful
Nation reaſonably hope to prevent thoſe
Judgments of Almighty God, which

execrable Murder of the Royal Father,
by another high Injuſtice in diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting

            <p>And what if it ſhould be granted,
that the Cauſe of mens Fears, and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106810:70"/>
concerning the Future State of a
Kingdom, is true and real? The worſt
that any good man can fear, from any
lawful Soveraign whatſoever, is ſuffering
under him; but it is far better to ſuffer
wrong, than to do it. And when ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
cannot be avoided, (as in this
World it ſometimes cannot) 'tis far
more tolerable to ſuffer under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt
Government of one rightful Prince,
than under the illegal Tyranny of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Invaders, who aſſume the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
and moſt unbounded Power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt right to any Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, do we deſire never more
to behold the infinite Outrages of an
Army of Rebels, with all the calamitous
Appendages of Civil Broyls? Are we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to change again the Golden Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of our Ancient Monarchy into the
Iron Rods of Republican Uſurpers? Let us
then unfeignedly lament, and in our
Places endeavour to remove the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sins of our Land, the indubitable
Cauſes of ſuch great and National
Plagues. And let us not think that
Sedition and Treaſon are the only ſins
that deſtroy Kings and Governments,
and bring Confuſions upon a People
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106810:70"/>
Although theſe more immediately do
Execution, yet there be others that
make us liable to Condemnation.</p>
            <p>If Atheiſm and Profaneneſs, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Curſing, Drunkenneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery,
Fraud and Oppreſſion abound
among us, ſhall not God viſit for ſuch
Tranſgreſſions as theſe? eſpecially when
men glory in them, and make them
the Marks and Badges of their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty;
as if they could not be good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
without Rioting and Ranting,
Tearing and Hectoring. This God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damming
Tribe, whatever their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
or Intentions be, are as real E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to their Soveraign and their
Country, as any of the Papiſts or Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks.
For men may fight againſt
their Prince, though they be not up
in Arms, and give him a fatal Blow,
though they never Aſſaſſinate him. All
great and National Vices have Treaſon
in them, and are not only levelled againſt
the Honour and Majeſty of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but alſo againſt the Crown and
Dignitie of the King, and the Peace
and Safety of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Let us not therefore joyn with any
Wicked men in their God-provoking
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106810:71"/>
and King-killing Sins, whereby we ſhall
contract at once the complicated Guilt,
Infamy and Miſery of being Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Common Ruine. But let
us all unanimouſly, according to the
Station in which God hath placed us,
avoid, diſcountenance, and ſuppreſs all
manner of Wickedneſs, and Irreligion.
At leaſt let us abate the Publick Guilt,
by leſſening the Number of our own
Sins.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106810:74"/>

               <hi>and blaſphemy.</hi> The latter
Part of it will now furniſh me with
no leſs ſuitable matter of Diſcourſe on
this Day of Joy and Thankſgiving, for
the Birth and Happy Return of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
moſt Auguſt Monarch, by whom,
through the great Bleſſing of Almighty
God, the flouriſhing condition of theſe
Kingdoms was moſt auſpiciouſly reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and hath been hitherto preſerved.</p>
            <p>In the whole Verſe I noted theſe
four things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ill State of a Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Polyarchy or Plurality of Supreme
Governours, When <hi>many are the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the notorious Cauſe of ſuch
a Judgment; 'tis expreſly aſcribed to
the Wickedneſs of a People, <hi>the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
of a Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the oppoſite National Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or the Happineſs of a Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a well ſettled Monarchy, <hi>When by
a man of underſtanding and knowledge,
the State thereof is prolonged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the principal means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſo great a Mercy is procured, The
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106810:74"/>
Wiſdom of the Monarch, his <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Two former of theſe I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
diſcourſed of, and now come to
the Third of them, The National Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or the Happineſs of a Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a well ſettled Monarchy, when <hi>by
a man of underſtanding and knowledge,
the State thereof is prolonged.</hi> By a
Man, that is to ſay, by one Man, one
Soveraign Prince, in oppoſition to the
many Princes before mentioned. And
how great a Bleſſing a well ſettled
Monarchy muſt needs be unto any
Nation, we may more than conjecture
from the following Particulars, in which
I ſhall endeavour to give ſome account
of its incomparable Dignity and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
beyond all other Models of
Government.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Monarchy is the Government <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
whereby God himſelf hath always go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
Angels and Men, and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ever ſince they had a Being, and
always will govern them ſo long as
any of them ſhall continue in Being.
God is a Great Monarch, the King of
all Kings, and Lord of Lords, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abſolute, illimited, and Supreme Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106810:75"/>
the one Almighty, independent,
and eternal Rector of the Univerſe,
who ever did, doth, and ſhall rule and
command all other Beings; who alone
hath all Power of himſelf, and is the
Fountain from whence all Dominion in
any other is derived. <hi>Thine, O Lord,</hi>
ſaith David, <hi>is the Greatneſs, and the
Power,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>and the Glory, and the Victory,
and the Majeſty: for all that is in the
Heaven and the Earth is thine. Thine
is the Kingdom, O Lord, and thou art
exalted above all. Both Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
come of thee, and thou reigneſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all.</hi> Theocracy or the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God himſelf is moſt perfectly
and neceſſarily Monarchical, which is a
clear Indication of the ſupereminent
Excellency of this Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that the happy Settlement
and durable Eſtabliſhment of a Nation
may be moſt effectually promoted by
it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Monarchy is the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which God hath choſen and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
among the Children of Men,
for the good of humane Societies in
Nations and Kingdoms. As himſelf by
Right of Creation and Conſervation
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106810:75"/>
hath an immenſe Monarchy over all
the World; ſo he hath ordained finite,
and limited Monarchies, in the ſeveral
Regions of the Earth, in each of which
it pleaſed his Divine Providence always
to ſet up one Deputy, or Vicegerent,
who next and immediately under him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
was Supreme Lord and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
of all, until at length Rebellions
and Uſurpations in ſome few of them
violated the Order of God, converted
Monarchies into Popular States, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
the Subjects above the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.
As it is in Gods Power alone
to appoint Rulers and Magiſtrates, and
to confer an Authority to govern the
World; ſo his Wiſdom is beſt able to
judge, what Form of Polity is moſt
conducive to the Welfare of Mankind.
And therefore ſuch ſort of Governours,
and Governments, as by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
have been moſt anciently and
univerſally eſtabliſhed, ought by infinite
Degrees to be preferred before any of
the new Models, which have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
and introduced by thoſe Troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of the World that are given to
Change.</p>
            <p>We juſtly value things according to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106810:76"/>
their Original, and their Antiquity.
Now if we would know the Original
and the Antiquity of Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
we muſt look back as far
as <hi>Adam,</hi> and look up as high as God.
Monarchy began in Heaven, and to
make this lower World happy, it was
ſoon after eſtabliſhed upon Earth. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Empire of <hi>Nimrod</hi> be the
firſt that is expreſly mentioned in the
Sacred Writings, yet the firſt of Men
was undoubtedly a Monarch, who, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the many hundred years he lived
in the World, was the only Soveraign
under God, and all his numerous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
were as much his Subjects as
they were his Children, being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the Law of God and Nature to
revere his irreſiſtible Authority, and to
pay a dutiful Obedience to him. After
his Death (his ſecond Son <hi>Abel</hi> being
ſlain, and <hi>Cain</hi> the Eldeſt curſed by God
for the Murder of him) the Empire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
to <hi>Seth</hi> his third Son, who, as
it is conceived, eſtabliſhed Religion, and
made Laws and Conſtitutions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Divine Worſhip: For in his Days
we read that <hi>Men began to call on the
Name of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 26.</note> After <hi>Seth, Enoſh</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:106810:76"/>
his Son ſucceeded in the Government;
After <hi>Enoſh,</hi> the following <hi>Patriarchs.</hi>
And ſo long as the World was but one
Nation, and of one Language, we may
rationally ſuppoſe, that they had but
one King. But at the Confuſion of
Languages, each Diviſion of People had
their Head, who undertook to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
them to ſome convenient Region,
where they might dwell together; and
ſo he who was their Leader, became
their Prince; as <hi>Heber</hi> was the King
of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence-forward there were
various Kingdoms, diſperſed over the
Face of the Earth, which were both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed,
and protected from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by the ſeparate Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of their ſeveral Princes. And
ſuch was the firm and ſtable Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which Monarchy had in all the
former Ages of the World, that the
Earth knew no other Power for above
three thouſand years. For the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
that Hiſtory takes notice of,
was at <hi>Athens;</hi> and it began, as ſome
ſay, after the Expiration of the Reign
of <hi>Eryxias,</hi> which happened in the
thirteenth Olympiad, and neer the Year
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106810:77"/>
of the World 3275, or at the fartheſt
after the Death of King <hi>Codrus,</hi> who
lived ſomewhat above an hundred years
before, and is ſaid to be the laſt King
of <hi>Athens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Juſt. Hiſt.</hi> l. 2.</note> by <hi>Juſtin</hi> and ſome others.
Afterwards <hi>Sparta, Corinth, Thebes,</hi> and
other Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> followed the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Athens.</hi> But thoſe little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealths
were continually plagued,
either with inteſtine Broils, or Foreign
Wars; and the <hi>Athenians</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
which were the firſt that changed
their Government, paid dearly for it,
when inſtead of one King, they had
thirty Tyrants reigning over them. And
at laſt, when theſe quarrelſome States
had almoſt ruined one another, they
were all made to ſubmit to the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi>
Empire, and never ſuffered to
erect that Form of Government again.
After theſe, I have not read of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
of Note in the World, beſides
the <hi>Roman,</hi> until our few Modern Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
were ſet up, whoſe later
Date is eaſily known. Since then it
was Monarchy under which the Nations
of the world lived and flouriſhed, in a
ſettled and uninterrupted courſe, for ſo
many thouſand years, it is not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106810:77"/>
that the happy State of a Land
ſhould be ſo well prolonged under any
ſort of Popular Government, which tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
Innovations have introduced.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As it is not to be doubted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
but Monarchy was anciently the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Government of the World, ſet
up by Divine Order and Approbation;
ſo it is particularly moſt clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
from Holy Scripture, that it was
of Gods own eſpecial Deſignation and
Appointment, among his peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he
had choſen above all other Nations, to
be the Objects of his ſingular Favour.
Their Government was Monarchical
as ſoon as they became a Nation, even
from the time of their Deliverance out
of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery; and ſo it all
along continued, until after that the
Son of God came down from Heaven
to be their King, their Nation was
moſt juſtly deſtroyed, for their horrid
Impiety, in rejecting and crucifying that
Prince of Peace.</p>
            <p>The firſt Governour God placed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them was <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was their
Lawgiver and Judge, and as real a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
as ever raigned. He was King
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106810:78"/>
in <hi>Jeſhurun,</hi> Deut. 33. 5. or according
to ſome Verſions, King in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He
was a King, as the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi>
ſaith upon the Place, <hi>Non quidem No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
&amp; Pompâ, ſed Jure regio.</hi> His
Power was Supreme, Sacred, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable,
his Will and Command un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable;
and thoſe that denied or
diſputed his Authority, received the
moſt exemplary Vengeance from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that was ever inflicted upon the
worſt of Mankind. He appointed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
divers inferior Magiſtrates and
Judges, as <hi>Jethro</hi> adviſed him; he choſe
able men out of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and made them
Heads over the People, Rulers of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
Hundreds, Fifties, and Tens; but
the Supreme Power he wiſely reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in his own Hands; and all the
moſt difficult and weighty Cauſes were
brought to him, that they might be
decided by his final and determinative
Sentence, from whence there was no
Appeal. Neither were any Sacred, or
Eccleſiaſtical matters exempted from his
Regulation and Government. The
whole Aaronical Miniſtry, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in Typical Rites, Ceremonies,
and Sacrifices, was ordered and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106810:78"/>
by him, although executed by the
Hand of <hi>Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after the Death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the
Supreme Authority of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was ſtill in a ſingle Perſon, being
committed by God, either to the High
Prieſt, or to ſome Eminent Man, whom
he was pleaſed to raiſe up, ſuch as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah</hi>
and the ſeveral Judges. For, that
the High Prieſt or the Judge, when
there was one in thoſe days, had the
Soveraign Power inveſted in him, is
evident from that Command of God,
<hi>Deut. 17. 12. And the man that will do
preſumptuouſly, and will not hearken unto
the Prieſt, that ſtandeth to miniſter there
before the Lord,</hi> (viz. to the High Prieſt,
as the ſcope of the place plainly ſhews)
<hi>or unto the Judge, even that man ſhal die,
and thou ſhalt put away the evil from</hi>
Iſrael, <hi>and all the People ſhall hear and
fear, and do no more preſumptuouſly.</hi> Is
not this as great an Authority as any
Monarch in the World can deſire, thus
to have all Perſons obliged to acquieſce
in his determinative Sentence and final
Decree, and to have a Power to puniſh
all wilful and preſumptuous diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with Death? <hi>Joſephus</hi> expreſly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106810:79"/>
calls their Judges Monarchs; and <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
ſuppoſeth them to have all things
belonging to Kings, except their pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Train and external Grandeur. <hi>Iſti

            </p>
            <p>If it be objected, That <hi>in thoſe days,</hi>
as ſome Texts ſpeak, <hi>there was no King
in</hi> Iſrael. The meaning of thoſe places
is not, that the Judges were not real
Monarchs, but that at ſome certain
times there was no particular Judge,
who ſat as their Supreme Dictator, and
exerciſed regal Authority among them;
as alſo, that the High Prieſt whoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
it was to govern, when there was
no Judge, was negligent and careleſs of
the publick Affairs. And the great
Bleſſings of Kings and Monarchs may
be underſtood, even by the horrid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties
and Diſorders that happened in
thoſe Days, when there was no King

and contrary to a publick and ſolemn
Oath. Theſe, and no better than theſe,
were the unhappy concomitants and
conſequents of having no King in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
that is to ſay, of having no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Ruler, who exerciſed a Soveraign
Power among them, as the Judge, and
when there was no Judge, the High
Prieſt ordinarily did.</p>
            <p>The laſt of their Judges was <hi>Samuel,</hi>
and when he had governed many years,
the Infirmities of his Age, and the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of his Sons, whom he placed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, gave them occaſion to deſire
a King, that they alſo might be like
all the other Nations, and that their
King might go our <hi>before them and fight
their Battels.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 8. 6, 19, 20.</note> Hereupon the Soveraign
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106810:80"/>
Power was tranſlated from Judges to
Kings, and ſo it ſtill was lodged in
the Hands of a ſingle Perſon. Neither
had their Kings any more Power, than
their High Prieſts and Judges had. For
<hi>Samuel,</hi> and his Predeceſſors, had as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Authority as any Soveraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
although they were not called Kings.
But now, like all other Nations, their
Governour was not only a King by the
Supremacy of his Power, but had the
very Name and Title, with all the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Magnificence and Enſigns of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.</p>
            <p>But here in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
State, we meet with a remarkable Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
which deſerves to be the more
conſidered, becauſe divers have thought
it a great Objection againſt Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernment.
The ſum of it is this,
That God was extreamly angry with
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for deſiring a King, and
proclaimed his Indignation by loud Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-claps,
and a violent tempeſtuous
Rain in Wheat-Harveſt;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 16, 17.</note> which made
them confeſs, that they had added to
all their Sins <hi>this evil in asking a King.</hi>
From whence ſome of our Republicans
conclude, That Regal Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106810:80"/>
is ſo far from being of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Appointment, that it is ſuch a
humane Invention as is diſpleaſing unto
God.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That although God
was angry with them for asking a King,
it was not for this Reaſon, becauſe he
hath any diſlike of Kingly Government.
He was not offended at the Act it ſelf
of deſiring a King,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Sherlocks</hi> Caſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Supreme Powers. <hi>p.</hi> 15.</note> which is in it ſelf
very innocent, and may often be moſt
juſt and neceſſary; but he was diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
at the manner and circumſtances
of it. In deſiring a King, they asked
a good, yea an excellent Thing, and a
great Bleſſing from Heaven. But God was
angry, becauſe they asked this good
Thing with an ill mind, and at a time
when they ought not to have deſired
it. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, It may be conceived, that they
asked a King out of the Pride of their
Hearts. They thought it a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be ſubject to a Judge, who
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ived among them without any great
Pomp or State. And although his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inſpired Wiſdom, and immediate
direction from Heaven, abundantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>enſated
all the defects of External
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106810:81"/>
Magnificence, they were unwilling to
be under ſuch a Governour; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ambitious of worldly Glory, they
would have ſuch a Soveraign Prince, as
the other Nations had, they would have
a King to go out and in before them,
with all the viſible Splendor of Royal
Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their deſiring a King was
accompanied with Infidelity and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
of Gods Providence and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
For it was when they were
in fear of an Invaſion by <hi>Nahaſh</hi> King
of <hi>Ammon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 12.</note> And that it was this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of theirs, rather than the Form
of Kingly Government, that God was
diſpleaſed at, is evident from <hi>Samuels</hi>
Expoſtulation with them, in which he
briefly recounts Gods conſtant care for
their Preſervation in all their former
Dangers; and how by the Hands of
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Jerubbaal,</hi> and
<hi>Jeptha,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> he had delivered
them from all their Enemies on every
ſide.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They deſired a King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any juſt Cauſe, or legal Warrant
or due Advice, in a raſh Tumultuous
and Seditious manner, at ſuch a time
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106810:81"/>
when they had a Supreme Judge (who
was a Lawful Soveraign) of Gods own
Appointment. Even in his Life and
Reign, they deſired a King. They had
not the Patience to expect his natural
<hi>Exit</hi> by Death, but they would have
this excellent Governour, who deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſo well of their Nation, Depoſed,
and ſome other Advanced in his place.
God might therefore very juſtly be
angry with them for rejecting ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and eminent a Perſon, who was
not only their rightful Prince, but one
who had Ruled with great Prudence,
Juſtice, and Clemency. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He was more eſpecially
angry with them for rejecting himſelf.
For God himſelfe was in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and by asking a
King to go out and in before them,
they threw off the Government of
God himſelf.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8. 7.</note> 
               <hi>They have not rejected
thee</hi> (ſays God to <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
diſcontented at their Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
<hi>but they have rejected me, that I
ſhould not reign over them.</hi> This then was
their great Sin and Fault, that they asked
a King, when they had already the beſt
of Kings,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 12.</note> when the Lord their God was
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106810:82"/>
their King. They were not culpable becauſe
they choſe to be under Monarchical
Government; for they were under that
before; but becauſe they preferred the
Government of a King, before the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Government of God. For du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Times of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah,</hi>
and the Judges, they being inſpired
Perſons, who acted by a Divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,
the exerciſe of their Authority
was under Gods own immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
But when God gave them a
King, though he himſelf was, in ſome
ſenſe, ſtill their King, and though the
King, which he gave them, was his
Miniſter and Vicegerent, who ruled by
and under him, and received the Laws
of Government from him; yet he
then in great meaſure left the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of it to the Will and Pleaſure
of Princes, and to the Methods of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Policy. Now I confeſs indeed,
the Government of an Earthly King is
not ſo eligible, as the Government of
God himſelfe; but it may notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be much better than any other Form
of humane Government; and it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
God thought it better; becauſe when
he foreſaw that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106810:82"/>
time be weary of his immediate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
he gave direction in their
Law for ſetting up a King, not for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
a Republick or Popular State;
As we find in <hi>Deut. 17. 14. When thou
art come to the Land which the Lord thy
God ſhall give thee, and ſhalt poſſeſs it,
and dwell therein, and ſhalt ſay, I will
ſet a King over me, like all the Nations
that are about me; thou ſhalt in any wiſe
ſet him over thee, whom the Lord thy
God ſhall chuſe.</hi> And the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that there were three ſpecial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
given their Fathers, which they
were obliged to obey, after their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
Poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
Firſt, that they ſhould have a King o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them. Secondly, that they ſhould
deſtroy <hi>Amalek.</hi> Thirdly, that they
ſhould build a Temple. Of which
three, the firſt was concerning the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up a King, becauſe the other two
were to be performed by him.</p>
            <p>It ſeems God was ſo far from being
an Enemy to Kings, that he deſigned a
perfect Regal Government for his own
People, as ſoon as they ſhould be well
ſettled in the promiſed Land. They
were then to have a King; a King not
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106810:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in any wiſe to be ſet up by the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the People, who have no Power
to govern themſelves, and can transfer
none to another, but a King of Gods
own chuſing; and a King, like thoſe of
other Nations, with all the external
Magnificence of Royal Majeſty. For ſo
<hi>Samuel</hi> repreſents the manner of their
King, which, though look'd upon by
ſome Learned Men, as a Deſcription of
Arbitrary Tyranny, is ſuppoſed by others
to be only an account of what is neceſſary
to the due ſupport of Regal Power, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the juſt Grandeur and Dignity
thereof. He tells them, that their King
ſhould take their Sons, <hi>and appoint them
for himſelf, for his Chariots, and to be
his Horſmen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and to be Captains o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Thouſands, and captains over Fifties,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>and take their Daughters to be his
Confectionaries and Cooks; and take their
Fields, and Vineyards, and Oliveyards,</hi>
that is to ſay, the Tenth of them;
for ſo it is expreſſed in the following
words; <hi>the Tenth of their Seed, and of
their Vineyards, and the Tenth of their
Sheep,</hi> &amp;c. All which ſeems to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
requiſite to the Royal State of
a Soveraign Prince, who cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106810:83"/>
without Servants and Officers of all
ſorts, both for his Domeſtick Affairs,
and for the Execution of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
nor maintain his Servants, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſufficient Revenue, by Publick
Taxes, ſuch as the Tenth of their Fields,
Vineyards, and Flocks, which was the
uſual Tribute paid to the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p>And now it muſt be acknowledged,
that <hi>Samuel</hi> does upon this account diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from deſiring a
King, becauſe the neceſſary ſupports
and expences of Royal Power would
ſeem oppreſſive and burdenſome to them,
who had been hitherto free from ſuch
Charges and Exactions. For while they
were governed by their former Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
by the High Prieſt or the Judge,
the Government was no charge at all
to them. The High Prieſt had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Maintenance, when he was Supreme
Governour, than when he was only
High Prieſt. And the Judge, whom
God extraordinarily raiſed up, was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
and ſupported in his Government
by the extraordinary Preſence of the
Divine Power, without the Aids of
Men or Money, without any Maſs of
Treaſure, or numerous Guards and Trains
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106810:84"/>
of Servants. But this is no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at all to the ordinary Kingly
Power,<note place="margin">See D. <hi>Sherlocks</hi> Caſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</note> as if that were more expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and burdenſome, than other Forms
of humane Government; becauſe it was
like to be a new Charge to a People,
whoſe peculiar Priviledge it was to be
free before from all ſuch Services and
Tributes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> then were at length,
by Gods own Wiſe Inſtitution, placed
under the Conduct and Dominion of
compleat and perfect Kings, who had
not only the Power and Office, but
alſo the very Name and Title, with all the
Magnificent Appendages of Regal Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Kings was <hi>Saul,</hi>
of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who, after
God had choſen and exalted him to
that high Dignity, was received as a
great Bleſſing from Heaven, with the
moſt joyful Acclamations of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And the Holy Ghoſt hath thought
fit to leave it upon Record, that they
were only the Children of <hi>Belial</hi> that
ſaid, <hi>how ſhall this Man ſave us,</hi> and
that ſuch Miſcreants were the only men,
<hi>who deſpiſed him and brought him no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents.</hi>
1 Sam. 10. 24. 27. The People
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106810:84"/>
had deſired a King, that might go out
before them, and fight their Battles;
which deſires and expectations <hi>Saul</hi> at
firſt very well anſwered. For when he
took the Kingdom over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he fought
againſt all their Enemies, on every ſide,
againſt <hi>Moab, Ammon, Edom, Zobah,</hi>
and the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> and <hi>whitherſoever he
turned himſelf, he vexed them. And he
gathered an Hoſt and ſmote the</hi> Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites,
<hi>and delivered</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of the
hands of them that hated them.</hi> 1 Sam.
14. 47, 48.</p>
            <p>And although God was pleaſed to
rend the Kingdom from <hi>Saul,</hi> for ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome of <hi>Amalek</hi> contrary to the
Divine Command, and for invading
the Prieſts Office, yet he was ſo far
from aboliſhing Kingly Power, that he
carefully appointed a Succeſſor in it,
and ſent <hi>Samuel</hi> to Anoint him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was ever his purpoſe to ſettle
the Kingdom in <hi>Judah;</hi> and therefore
he took occaſion from <hi>Saul's</hi> Sins, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
the Crown upon <hi>David</hi> and his
Line, who were of that Tribe, making
the Succeſſion to it Hereditary in the
Days of <hi>Solomon,</hi> when it was in its
moſt flouriſhing and glorious State
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106810:85"/>
And when he had thus fixed the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of that Kingdom, according to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s
Prophecy, he never ſuffered it to
depart from <hi>Judah</hi> until <hi>Shiloh</hi> came.
Thus we ſee the Government of the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation was all along Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
even from the Days of <hi>Moſes</hi> unto
the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and it is
not to be imagined, but that God, who
choſe them to be his peculiar People,
would alſo chuſe for them the beſt
Form of Government extant in the
World.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Kings were
not real Soveraigns, but were (as is
affirmed by ſome of the Rabbins) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to the Sanhedrim or Senate of
Seventy one Perſons, and (which is more)
might be ſcourged by the Sanhedrim;
only by the great Sanhedrim at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
ſay ſome, yea, ſay others, by the
leſs Sanhedrim of twenty three, which
was the Government of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
City; This (as the Learned Dr. <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
hath evidently proved) is a meer
Fiction of the Modern Rabbins,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chriſtian Loyalty</hi> l. 1. c. 3.</note> and
deſerves as much to be believed, as their
prodigious Story in the <hi>Talmud</hi> of the
number of Horſes for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s own Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106810:85"/>
which are there ſummed up to an
hundred and ſixty Millions, accounting
a thouſand thouſand to a Million. And
although both <hi>Romiſh</hi> Writers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of an Antimonarchical ſtrain, in
managing their reſpective Deſigns,
have frequent recourſe to this Plea of
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synedrial Power, yet it is
not therefore in any degree the more
credible. <q>For thoſe men (as the Dr.
obſerves) who can believe, that the
Apoſtolical Form of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was by Lay Elders, becauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
late Authors, but neither Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
nor Ancient Fathers, do aſſert it;
and thoſe who can perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that our Saviour made the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> the Univerſal Monarch
of the whole World, and gave him a
Plenitude of all Temporal and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Power; becauſe many Writers of
that Communion do now aſſert this,
while what is inconſiſtent therewith
was declared by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and the Ancient Chriſtian Church,
ſuch men have underſtandings of a fit
ſize, and ſuitable diſpoſition, to receive
theſe Rabbinical Traditions concerning
the Synedrial Authority and Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</q>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, After our Saviours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Monarchy being the Univerſal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
ſettled and eſtabliſhed in all
conſiderable Nations and Countries, he
was ſo far from changing and altering
this moſt ancient and univerſal Polity,
that he required and commanded all his
Diſciples to live in Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to it. That the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
was of the ſame Nature with the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſthood, tht Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was a Figure and a Shadow in
that Oeconomy, a part of the Legal
Paedagogie, inconſiſtent with Chriſtian
Liberty, and conſequently aboliſhed by
the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> is ſuch a
wild and abſurd imagination, as our
Enthuſiaſtick Republicans could never
have entertained, if they had once ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
peruſed either the Goſpel of
our Bleſſed Saviour, or the Writings of
his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>He who declared,<note place="margin">John 18. 36.</note> that his <hi>Kingdom
was not of this World,</hi> came not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
or unhinge the Kingdoms he found
here. He came not to extinguiſh the
Title, break the Scepters, and trample
upon the Crowns, of Earthly Monarchs,
but gave a greater ſecurity and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106810:86"/>
to their juſt Dominion, than
ever it had before. He never claimed
a Power of judging, cenſuring, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
Soveraign Princes, although ſome
of his profeſſed Servants in <hi>Rome,</hi> in
<hi>Geneva,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and (I wiſh I could
not ſay) in <hi>England,</hi> have. The Son
of God was no Enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but
acknowledged his Imperial Authority,
and commanded men to render to him
all the Rights which belong to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Majeſty. When that enſnaring
Interrogation was propoſed by the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes,<note place="margin">Mark 12. 14.</note>
               <hi>Is it lawful to give Tribute unto</hi>
Caeſar? He not only gave a diſtinct
Anſwer to their particular Enquiry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
them of their Obligation to
pay Tribute, but alſo laid down this
general Rule, That they ought to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to <hi>Caeſar all the things that are Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars.</hi>
He plainly proved to them the
juſt Soveraignty of <hi>Caeſar</hi> by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of Coining Money, and gave
them an ocular Demonſtration of it, by
ſhewing them the Majeſty of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
in the Image upon their Coin,
and the Characters of his Authority
in the Superſcription. And yet <hi>Caeſar</hi>
was at this time their Soveraign, not
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106810:87"/>
by an ancient and hereditary Right,
but by the more dubious Title of a new
and late Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour owned the Power of
Governing the World, delegated by God
to Emperors and Monarchs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
that Delegation by his own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to it. As he told the <hi>Roman</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,
<hi>that he could have no Power at
all againſt him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 19. 11.</note> 
               <hi>except it were given him
from above;</hi> ſo conſidering the Divine
Original of that Power, he meekly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
even to the moſt cruel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
Exerciſe of it, not denying the
Authority of his Judge, although his
Sentence was the moſt wicked that was
ever pronounced. He, who knew that
Kings and Emperours ſhould hereafter
be Nurſing Fathers to his Church, would
not now take away their Power, or in
the leaſt diminiſh their Soveraignty, or
oppoſe them with any forcible Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
tho' no man ever ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them ſuch unjuſt and inhuman U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
as he met with.</p>
            <p>Neither did any of his Apoſtles take
upon them to New-model the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the World, but were exact
Followers of their Lord and Maſter, in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106810:87"/>
a quiet and peaceable ſubmiſſion unto,
and in a juſt revering of all Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Kings and Monarchs, as no other
than Gods Miniſters and Vicegerents.
The higher Powers which St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in
the <hi>13th</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> calls the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God, and to which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
every Soul to be ſubject upon pain
of Damnation, were at that time Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical;
and although the Perſon
poſſeſſed of thoſe Powers is generally
thought to be <hi>Nero,</hi> who was one of
the worſt Monarchs that ever Reigned;
yet he earneſtly preſſeth the neceſſity
of Subjection to him, not only <hi>for Wrath,
but alſo for Conſcience ſake:</hi> Becauſe as
bad as he was, he was advanced to the
Empire by God, he was Gods Miniſter,
and inveſted with his Authority. It
ſeems St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo great a Friend to
Monarchical Government, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a dutiful Subjection to it, as to
the Conſtitution and Appointment of
God, and would not give the leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to attempt its alteration,
by ſetting up a Popular Soveraignty;
although the Emperor, who then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
was not only a Heathen, but
ſuch a prodigious Tyrant, as no Prince
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106810:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the Chriſtian World ever was, or
is ever like to be. The ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
alſo manifeſtly prefers Monarchs,
before all other Governours, when he
exhorts <hi>that Prayers and Supplications
be made firſt for Kings, and then for all
others in Authority.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 1. And
St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives an undeniable Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of Monarchy, when he ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
placeth the Soveraign Power in
a ſingle Perſon, and ſo expreſly fixeth
it there, as any man may ſee he doth,
in the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Chap.
2. Verſes 13, 14. <hi>Submit your ſelves to
every Ordinance of man, for the Lords
ſake, whether it be to the King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
or unto Governours, as unto them
that are ſent by him.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
ſubjection to all humane Power
and Authority, which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
humane Creature, or Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not as if it were ſo the Ordinance
of Man, as not to be the Ordinance of
God; for then St. <hi>Peter</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but becauſe the Power
and Authority, which is appointed by
God, is managed, exerciſed, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
by, and among, and over men,
and for the good of men. Although
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106810:88"/>
he calls it the Ordinance of man, he
exhorts to ſubmit to it, for the Lords
ſake, which plainly ſignifies, that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hand men have in the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the exerciſe of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
yet it is appointed by God,
and derived from him. But that which
I chiefly obſerve in this Apoſtolical
command, is, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> manifeſtly
aſſerts the Soveraign Power of Kings
and Monarchs, but not of the Senate
or the People. According to his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
the King is the ſole Supreme
Governour, and all others are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned
by him, and ought to live in
ſubjection to him. They were to obey
<hi>Claudius,</hi> the then <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, as
their higheſt Lord and Governour,
next and immediately under God, they
were alſo to ſubmit to <hi>Furius Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
Scribonianus,</hi> and to the other <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Procurators in their ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
but theſe they were to obey
under the Emperor, only as his Officers
and Miniſters, only ſo far, and ſo long as
they derived Authority from him. Thus
we ſee Chriſt and his Apoſtles acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
approved, and confirmed that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical
Power, by which they found
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106810:89"/>
the World governed, and gave no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the novel Opinions of
thoſe State-menders, who are for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up a popular Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Monarchy hath in it ſelf a
real and intrinſick Dignity and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
beyond all other Models of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
It is moſt agreeable to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to the common Genius of
Mankind. 'Tis moſt eaſie and ſafe,
moſt worthy and honourable; and moſt
apt to procure and promote the chief
ends of Government, having far more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
and fewer inconveniences, than
any Ariſtocratical or Democratical State.</p>
            <p>We ſee there is but one Head o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the ſeveral Members of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Body, and 'tis almoſt as monſtrous
to have it otherwiſe in the Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick.
There is but one Mind or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
to govern all the humane
Paſſions and executive Powers, and if
any of them command and control in
the place of Reaſon, it is a Rebellion
and Uſurpation. By the Ordinance of
Heaven, one Sun rules the Day, and
one Moon the Night; but if divers
Suns appear at the ſame time, or if
Comets give light inſtead of the Moon,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106810:89"/>
theſe are look'd upon with horror, as
the Prodigies of Nature, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
Omens of Wars and Plagues, and
dire Calamities coming upon the world.
Among the Bees, as Naturaliſts obſerve,
a little Monarch governs the whole
Swarm. Of the Cranes, one flies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and leads the company. Among
Sheep and other Cattle, one guides the
Flock, and is as it were Herdſman to
the reſt. Thus there appears ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of Monarchy thorow the
whole courſe of Nature. And if it had
not been hugely agreeable to Mankind,
it could never have ſo univerſally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
as it hath; it could never have
ſo long continued the ſtanding Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of all Ages, and of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
except a very few. For the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Common-wealths that have been
erected in the world, compared with
the Monarchies and Regal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is as ſmall and inconſiderable,
as the number of ſtrange and monſtrous
Births, compared with thoſe uſual and
natural Productions, which daily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
according to the regular courſe of
Things. And of thoſe few Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
ſome have been forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106810:90"/>
to Monarchy, that they might not
be ruined under their new Models.</p>
            <p>No other Government hath ſuch a
ſtable Foundation for its own conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
or for the firm and durable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Peace and Happineſs of the
People governed, as Monarchy hath.
When the different Intereſts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
minds; the various Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the contrary Humours of the
many chief Magiſtrates of a Republick,
are ready to tear the State in pieces;
the Monarch rules and governs all things
with an eaſie, peaceful, and undiſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Determination, having none to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with him, or to controle him.
Where Many govern, there will be ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable
Diviſions and Diſſentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them; and we know, that a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand.</hi>
But ſuch Diſcords and Dangers cannot
ariſe, where the Soveraignty is in a
ſingle Perſon.</p>
            <p>The Monarch alſo may readily and
ſpeedily at any Time, or in any Place,
Judge and Decree concerning the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs. But the ſeveral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
in a Republick muſt appoint a
Time and Place, when and where to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106810:90"/>
meet together; and after they are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled,
there are frequently many long
and tedious debates, before any thing
can be effected, if they do at laſt agree
what to determine. In ſhort, all thoſe
inconveniences of a Popular Government,
mentioned in a former Diſcourſe, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
in Monarchy.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that the Wiſdom, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Counſel and Conduct of many,
may be much better than of one alone.
This is true: But then we ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Ruling and Miniſtring; Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Aſſiſting; Commanding and
Counſelling. The Aid and Advice of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Wiſe men may be greater and better
than of one. <hi>Without Counſel,</hi> ſaith Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,<note place="margin">Prov. 15. 22. &amp; 24. 6.</note>
               <hi>purpoſes are diſappointed, but in the
multitude of Counſellors they are eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
And again, <hi>In multitude of Counſellors
there is ſafety.</hi> But what his Opinion was
of a Multitude of Princes, my Text hath
ſufficiently diſcovered. In weighty Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
'tis good to hear the ſeveral Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Opinions of many; but the
reſolving and determining what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
is to be followed, the Decreeing and
Commanding what ſhall be done, is beſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106810:91"/>
and ſooneſt performed by one. He who
hath compared the various Opinions of
divers wiſe Counſellors in any Caſe,
ſhall be able to give a Judgment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
like an Oracle. He who hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
and digeſted all their Arguments,
both on the one ſide and on the other,
may eaſily and ſpeedily determine the
matter, which many cannot do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great difficulty, and long conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>As for the common Objection, that
Monarchy is apt to degenerate into Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;
and that the Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the Subject are more ſecured
and better preſerved in a Republick; this
hath been confuted by our own ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
under the late Uſurping Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
of <hi>England,</hi> when we ſaw
more Tribunals of Iniquity, more Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Property, more unjuſt, Arbitrary
and Tyrannical Proceedings againſt our
Lives and Liberties, and all our deareſt
Enjoyments, in the ſpace of four or five
years, than our Anceſtors ever ſuffered
under any of the preceding Monarchs
(perhaps under all of them) in all the
Ages that are paſt. There is no ſort of
humane Government, which is not liable
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106810:91"/>
to ſome miſcarriages; and where the
Soveraignty is inveſted in many, there
it is liable unto moſt. Neither is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that there ſhould be ſo much Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
in a Monarchy, as there may be
in a Republick, unleſs we can imagine
that one Tyrant may be guilty of more
Outrages and Cruelties than thirty or
forty, who may have all the ſame Will
and the ſame Power to do miſchief, that
the one hath.</p>
            <p>In a word, all thoſe good Offices and
beneficial Acts of Government, which
the many Chief Magiſtrates in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
can perform by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of their number, may be done much
better and eaſier, by one Soveraign Prince,
with the Aſſiſtance of his Counſellors
and Miniſters. But the abuſes of Supreme
Power can never be ſo great or ſo many,
when it is committed unto one, as they
may be, when it is committed unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>There is now only the laſt Obſervable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
in the Text to be conſidered by us,
namely, the principal means of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and durable State of a Nation under
Monarchy, and that is the Wiſdom of
the Monarch, <hi>his underſtanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106810:92"/>
But by a man of underſtanding and
knowledge the State thereof ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Niloxenus</hi> being asked, what was the
beſt and moſt uſeful thing in the world?
Anſwered, <hi>A King,</hi> who being the Image
of God, is above all, and commands all.
But when the King reſembles God not
only in his Supreme Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but alſo in his Divine Wiſdom and
Goodneſs, When <hi>Light, and Knoweldge,
and Vnderſtanding, and an excellent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is found in him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 5. 11, 12.</note> He is then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the greateſt Bleſſing that Earth can
enjoy, or Heaven beſtow. <hi>A King that
ſitteth in the Throne of Judgment, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
away all evil with his Eyes.</hi> Prov.
20. 8. His Wiſdom and Circumſpection
protects his numerous Subjects, againſt
thoſe injuries which they may receive
either from within, by Diſorders among
themſelves, or from without, by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
and Invaſions of a Foreign Power.
And this he doth, by oppoſing and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
the Authors of ſuch Miſchiefs. <hi>For
a wiſe King ſcattereth the Wicked, and
draweth the Wheel over them.</hi> Prov. 20.
26. That is, He diſcovers and diſſolves
the Aſſociations of ill Men, diſperſes their
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106810:92"/>
Aſſemblies, breaks their Combinations,
and gives them the due Rewards of
their unjuſt Enterpriſes. The only Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers
of a State are wicked and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Men; theſe therefore his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ſuppreſſeth, that he may procure
and preſerve a ſettled Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.
Thus <hi>the King by Judgment
ſtabliſheth the Land,</hi> Prov. 29. 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the common ſort of People be
of a perverſe Nature, Vain and Ignorant,
Proud and Contentious, impatient of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
deſirous of unbounded Liberty,
unwilling to be tied to Laws, hard to be
tamed, and apt to run into Confuſions;
yet the Prince, who is well skilled in the
Myſtery of Empire, bridles this Behe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth,
puts his hook into the Noſe of this
Leviathan, reduceth the wild and boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Multitude to ſome Order and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and by inflicting exemplary Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on ſome of the worſt of them,
keeps the reſt in due Bounds.</p>
            <p>The Wiſe Monarch, being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the various Humours and
Paſſions of Mankind, and eſpecially with
that diverſity of Temper and Manners,
which may be obſerved in his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
applies himſelf properly to them,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106810:93"/>
and ſo manages them as to make their
contrary Studies, Inclinations, and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
joyntly conſpire to advance the
common Good.</p>
            <p>He underſtands the Nature and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of his Affairs; views things
not only in their preſent Poſture and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
Appearance, but ſearches them
to the bottom, enquires into the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Iſſues and Events of them, conſiders
their Cauſes, Concomitants, Effects, and
Conſequents, with all their accidents
and relations; and uſeth not only his
own Judgment, but the beſt advice of
the wiſeſt men within his Dominions;
by which means he finds out the fitteſt
Expedients, for providing for the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Proſperity of his Kingdom, and
the improvement of its Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
            <p>His Laws are excellently contrived for
the publick benefit; not too gentle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſuch are ſeldom obeyed; nor too
ſevere, becauſe ſuch are ſeldom executed.
He will reign in mens Hearts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
as well as over their Bodies; and
that he may be no leſs loved than feared,
he allays the Terror of Irreſiſtible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and the Dread of Supreme Power,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106810:93"/>
by gracious Aſſurances of his Royal
Goodneſs. He looks upon Juſtice and
Mercy as the great Pillars that ſupport
his Government, and hath an equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to them both. <hi>His Throne ſhall be
eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs,</hi> (Prov. 25. 5.)
<hi>and upholden by mercy,</hi> (Prov. 20. 28.) He
is not ſo rigorous, as to be wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon Juſtice; nor ſo remiſs, as by his
mildneſs to bring his Authority into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>He diſtinguiſhes Times and Seaſons;
knows when to Pardon, and when to
Puniſh; when to looſen, and when to
ſtraiten the Reins of his Government.
He diſcerns Perſons too; not only who
are good Subjects, and who are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
or diſaffected; but alſo, who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and faithful Friends, whoſe Reports
he may credit, whoſe Judgment and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
he may truſt; and who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
Flatterers and Sycophants,
thoſe Wolves in Sheeps clothing, thoſe ſly
Traytors under the Mantle of Loyalty.
He knows whom to employ, and whom
to reject; whom to reward, and whom
to chaſtiſe, Prov. 14. 35. <hi>The Kings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
is towards a wiſe Servant: but his
Wrath is againſt him that cauſeth Shame.</hi>

The Conſtancy alſo of the Prince is a
conſiderable part of his Prudence, and
he preſerves the Nation he governs in a
long and happy ſtability, by being ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in his own Reſolutions, agreeable to
himſelf, ſuiting his Actions to his Words,
and thoſe to his Principles, and all to
the Rule of right Reaſon. For tho' he
accommodates himſelf to the various cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of Things, Perſons, Times,
and Events, like the skilful Pilot, who
according to the different State of the
Sea, and the ſeveral changes of the Wind,
doth diverſly turn and guide his Sails;
yet in all the Mutations, Revolutions,
and Viciſſitudes of his Affairs, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
unmoveably the ſame, obviating e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Emergency, and managing every
Caſe, with a ſtedfaſt Preſence of Mind,
and even Temper of Soul, and a uniform
Method of Procedure, either regulated
by his own former Experience, or by
the Obſervations of Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Glory and Majeſty of
a Wiſe Monarch ſhines always with the
ſame bright Rays, caſting a fair Luſtre,
and diffuſing a benign Influence all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
ſo that if any ſort of People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Dominions, be not quickened
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106810:94"/>
and warmed by his kind Beams, it is
becauſe their free paſſage is hindered, by
the groſs Miſts of Error, Prejudice, and
Diſaffection, or by the interpoſition of
ſome ſuch Obſtacles. His prudent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
makes his good Subjects
happy. But 'tis no wonder, if thoſe men
live ſomewhat uneaſily under the moſt
excellent Government, who inſtead of
Loyal Obedience to it are continually
miſrepreſenting, libelling, and oppoſing
it, that by rendring it odious, they may
perſuade people to a defection from it,
and reduce it to thoſe difficulties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
which may give them oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
either to undermine, or overturn
it. Neither is it fit indeed, that ſuch men
ſhould proſper in their accurſed Attempts
and Machinations. 'Tis none of the leaſt
Benefits which a Kingdom receives from
the Prudence of the Soveraign, That it is
thereby protected from ſuch a Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Party within it, which, if they were
not curbed and reſtrained, would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ruine the whole. Thus we ſee the
excellent Effects of Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in a Prince, and how greatly it
makes for the Happineſs of a Land.</p>
            <p>But yet we are not to think, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106810:95"/>
Wiſe Monarch is always fortunate
and ſucceſsful, or that he can continually
preſerve the Peace and Proſperity of his
Subjects. For in the Affairs of this world,
the Effect is not always tyed to the Means.

               <hi>Except

ſagacious Prince cannot certainly foreſee
all thoſe dangerous Events, and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Accidents, which, if they be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
may ſuddenly ſpring up, and prove
fatal to the State. Neither is he always
furniſhed with the Power to prevent the
Miſchiefs and Calamities that he may
probably expect, and prepare againſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
may be wanting to effect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things, which his Wiſdom may tell
him are neceſſary to be done; and thoſe
which he employs, if they be not wiſe
and faithful, may ſoon mar all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances,
and ſpoil his moſt hopeful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106810:95"/>
Yea although he hath all humane
Aids imaginable, the beſt and ableſt
Counſellors, the ſtrongeſt Armies, the
richeſt Treaſures, and all managed with
the greateſt Prudence, Courage, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
yet he may be oppoſed by ſome
ſort of Enemies, which he can never
maſter. All his Wiſdom, and all his Power
can make but a weak Reſiſtance againſt
conſuming Famines, deſtroying Plagues,
violent Tempeſts, raging Inundations,
and fearful Earth-quakes. He cannot ſtop
the malignant Influences of the Stars,
nor ſuppreſſs the noxious Vapours of the
Earth, nor purifie the contagious Air,
nor give Laws to the proud ſwelling
Waves, that the Winds and Seas may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
him. Theſe things he only can do,
who hath a Supreme Soveraignty over
all the World.</p>
            <p>And therefore the truly Wiſe Prince
doth not confide in his own Policy or
Strength, but humbly implores the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Bleſſing of the Divine Providence
to protect his Perſon, guide his Counſels,
and proſper all his Endeavours, for the
publick Welfare. Which that he may the
better obtain, he will employ his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for the Maintenance and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106810:96"/>
of true Religion. He will rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
men in the Fear of God, always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring,
that tho' he hath no Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
upon Earth, he hath one in Heaven.
His Power ſhall be the ſupport of Virtue,
the Shield of Innocence, the Fence of
Right, the Shelter of injured and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
weakneſs, the Encouragement of
them that do well, and the Terror of
evil Doers; whereby he will anſwer the
ends of his Inſtitution, as it becomes the
Chief Miniſter of God for the Good of
a Nation. Now ſuch a Prince, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the difficulties of Empire,
hath no great cauſe to deſpair of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
ſucceſs in the management of it. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
commonly waits upon well-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
Attempts; and the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which is wont to afford its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the juſt and regular Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of private men, is much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for Soveraign Princes, who are
Gods Vicegerents and Repreſentatives.

Honour and Truſt is placed, eſpecially if

hope, that Heaven will afford him all

            <p>But if it ſhould ſo happen, that God

into the Hands of his Enemies, thereby to
puniſh the Tranſgreſſion of an ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Land, (which was the Caſe of the
Royal Martyr) while the guilty People
owe all their Miſeries to their own Sins,
the end of the Wiſe and Juſt Prince ſhall be
Peace, everlaſting Peace, and Glory in
the Life to come. And the People alſo,
if God be gracious to them, after their
own ſad Experience hath taught them the
difference between the gentle Reign of
a rightful Monarch, and the unbounded
Tyranny of various Uſurpers, may be
made happy again, by the Re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Government, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration

And now if Monarchy be ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

Praiſe.</p>
            <p>This Day our moſt Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
was Born, a Prince deſigned by
Providence to be the Miracle of this Age.
A Prince, whoſe great Sufferings, and
great Wiſdom learned by them, whoſe ſad
Afflictions, and wonderful Deliverances
from them, whoſe innumerable Dangers
and conſtant Protections againſt them,
no Hiſtory can parallel. A Prince whoſe
Government is ſuch, that nothing in
the World ought to be more deſirable
to theſe Nations, than the long and
happy continuance of it.</p>
            <p>This Day he had alſo as it were a
ſecond Birth, when after a long Exile,
God was pleaſed in a ſtupendious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to bring him back to the Throne
of his Fathers, and in him and with him
to reſtore the moſt Auguſt Monarchy
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106810:97"/>
of Great <hi>Britain:</hi> A Thing effected by
ſuch admirable Trains of Providence,
and ſuch manifeſt Declarations of the
Kindneſs and Favour of Heaven, both
to this Imperial Crown, and to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Poſſeſſor of it, that it alone, if
thorowly conſidered, were enough for
ever to ſilence all theſe Factions among
us, that are any way diſaffected, either
towards the one, or towards the other.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore render all poſſible
Thanks to the moſt High God, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Period to our Civil War, and
all the Calamities of a twelve years
unſettlement and Uſurpation, by placing
over us again ſuch a Government, and
ſuch a Governour; and for preſerving
both Him and It, for theſe twice twelve
years, ſince their Miraculous Reſtauration.</p>
            <p>And with our Praiſes, let us joyn our
Prayers, That God who hath hitherto ſo
wonderfully delivered our moſt Gracious
Soveraign from Enemies and Dangers of
all ſorts, would ſtill protect his Royal
Perſon, continue his Health and Vigor,
inſpire his Mind with Wiſdom, and Crown
his Endeavours with ſucceſs, that by his
