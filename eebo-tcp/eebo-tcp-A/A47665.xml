            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

apace to behold this Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
this fair <hi>Gallery of Heroick Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
first erected in <hi>France</hi> to the
Honour and instruction of your Sex,
and now transported into <hi>England</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same Account.</p>
            <p>These Gallant <hi>Heroesses</hi> repaired
first from all the Regions of History
to the Court of <hi>France</hi> to lay down their Crowns at the Queen
Regents Feet: This Ceremonie and Duty performed, they
had a desire to passe the Sea, and inform themselves of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and state of this Island; And finding no Queen here to
whom they might render the same obedience, they resolved to
address themselves to you, hoping to finde amongst such noble
Company, some Ladies, who resemble them at least in part of
their Vertues, if not in all.</p>
            <p>A Voyage of this Nature deserves the best Entertainment;
And the most sumptuous Feast you can set forth to such illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Guests in acknowledgement of the Honour they have
done you by this Visit, will be the pure oblation of your Hearts
inflamed with a desire to follow their Glorious steps, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
their Exemplar Vertues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55122:4"/>
The conversation of such brave women cannot chuse but be
most delightful and instructive to you: and some of your hours
I assure my self, will be well imployed in giving a serious Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Stories of their renowned Actions, and in reflecting
chiefly on the examples of those Christan <hi>Heroesses,</hi> who beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
this rich <hi>Structure,</hi> and contribute most to your Imitation.
Their gallantry is so perfect, as you need not doubt, but they will
gladly suffer your noble Hands to take some Flowers out of
their Garlands; which if well applyed, Crowns may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
on them, and one day placed upon your Heads by some
worthy Person of our Countrey, who taking notice of your
Vertuous Carriages and improved Actions in this land of trial,
may hereafter erect a new Gallery, in which your Statues and
Names will remain a Spectacle of Honour and Imitation to
Posterity.</p>
            <p>I need say no more, having given you sufficient matter of
Emulation: It is powerful in all great souls, and observed to
be particularly grafted in your Sex. I will not then detain you
any longer from entring into this resplendent <hi>Gallery,</hi> but open

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Heroick Women</hi> assembled in this
<hi>Gallery</hi> are come from all parts of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
to lay down their Crowns at your
Majesties Feet, and to congratulate in
common the Honour you have rendred
to your Sex. True it is, <hi>Madam,</hi> that all
the Eyes of <hi>Europe</hi> are now fix'd on you.
And there are no Mouths so little Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and so much ingaged elsewhere, which do not seriously,
and sincerely applaud you.</p>
            <p>However, <hi>Madam,</hi> I may say, that the Company I present
unto you will bring no confusion to the Feast. They are Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
and Illustrious Women, who have been like your self,
the choicest objects of their Ages: They are Victorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whom Vertue and Glory have Crowned with their own
Hands. And this must needs be a sweet satisfaction to you that
so many Soveraign and Illustrious Women have descended
from their Thrones and Theaters to become your Spectators.
The Sound and Acclamations of so many <hi>Heroesies</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
you with their Hands cannot chuse but be a pleasing
harmony to your Ears.</p>
            <p>The chief thing, <hi>Madam,</hi> is, that these Applauses are no
Stage Representations; that these Acclamations are no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
or purchased Flatteries. They are serious and legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Tributes, which the vanquished pay to their <hi>Victress.</hi>
And you have vanquished them with so much Grace and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
<pb facs="tcp:55122:5"/>
the Advantages you have over them are so charming,
and your emulation hath been so modest, as there is not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them who is not thankful and well pleasing with your
Victory.</p>
            <p>This Victory, <hi>Madam,</hi> so acceptable to the Vanquished,
is intirely Yours. It is not of your Regency; It is of your
whole Person: And though it be Peaceable and free from
blood, yet it is not inferiour to those tumultuary and bloudy
Victories you have gained in the generall distemper of all
<hi>Europe.</hi> It is certainely your great glory to have overcome on
the Rhein, on the two Seas beyond the Alps and the Pyrene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Mountains: But your Glory (Madam) is much greater,
by having ouercome in Histories and Annals, in Heroick
Ages, and in the Region of great Examples. And what
noise soever is made by the Arm's of <hi>France,</hi> the Reputation
of your Vertue Victorious over the <hi>Artemisias,</hi> the <hi>Rada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guna's</hi>
and <hi>Pantbea's,</hi> is far more illustrious and resplendent
then the renown of your Fortune victorious over so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
Armies, and reduced Fortresses.</p>
            <p>I need not fear that any one will accuse me of flattery, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
my words with hyperbolicall Excesse. Heathen Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
were never of the force, or stature of Christian Vertues,
and amongst these later yours (<hi>Madam</hi>) are the most Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
and eminent; they are Heroick and Soveraign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Your Piety indeed is of another Elevation and Zeal, then
their affected shews of Devotion, who limit to the circle of
their Beads, who referre all their Meditations to the modesty
of their dresse, and to a few tears squeezed out by force. Your
Piety amuseth not its self in making smoak in the house of
God, and trafficking with him by consuming Tapers, and
evaporating Perfumes. It draws from the bottom of your
heart the fire Incense and Victime of the Sacrifices it offers to
his Divine Majesty; And which is more acceptable to him
then all the Gums of Land and Sea; which is more pleasing
to him then the bloud of slaughtered flocks; it presents unto
him the Contrition of a Soveraign heart, the Humility of a
Crowned head, and the abasement and adoration of a humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
and religious Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55122:5"/>
This private Worship, and these domestique Sacrifices,
make not her whole imployment; she hath other more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Practises, and other Exercises exposed to the eyes of the
world. These Practises are Instructions which equall the
worth of Laws: And these Exercises are Examples which
command. She refers her particular devotions to the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the People: She Prayes and Meditates for an infinity
of Souls: And the Propagation of Faith, the Defence of the
Church, the safety of the Kingdom, the Peace and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the whole Christian World are the points of her Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and the scope of her Prayers.</p>
            <p>Publick persons ought thus to meditate and pray for the
Publick: Their Devotion should be a devotion of Order, and
their Zeal a zeal of Discipline. They cannot vow any thing
better then wholesome Laws, and good Examples, not any
thing more holy then Mercy and Iudgement. And what is
aspiration and desire in their Oratory, ought to be reduced to
Order and Policy in the Body of the State. In this sence it is
said, that Piety is an universal Good, and for all uses; And in
what sence soever it be spoken, the extent of this saying is at
present filled up by the extent of your Piety, which is the
Generall Merit, and the Common good of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Is it not your Piety, which hath forced heaven, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the resistance of yeers; which hath obtained the fruit of
Benediction, the expectation and desire of the People, after all
their desires were exhausted, and their hope and patience in a
manner consumed? Is it not this Piety which hath retained
on our side both the Fortune which the death of the deceased
King had set at liberty, and the reputation which seemed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to retire with Fortune? Is it not this Piety which crowned
the ashes of this good Prince and brought Victory to his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall;
which infused resolution and courage into the sorrow
of <hi>France;</hi> which shewed unto our Enemies couragious and
formidable Tears, and a bold and triumphant Sadnesse? Is it not
this Piety which hath made the Perfume wherewith our mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Devils have been chased away; which hath bound up
the spirit of Discord, fatall to Regencies, and funestous to the
Minorities of Princes?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55122:6"/>
Our fear <hi>Madam</hi> was, that we did ask too much, and did
beleeve our wishes too great when we demanded a smooth
and peaceable <hi>Regency</hi> for your Majestie, and when we wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King a <hi>Minority</hi> free from Rebellion and Troubles:
Yet what we behold at present <hi>Madam,</hi> is far greater then
our wishes, and much exceeding our demands. VVe see a
<hi>Regency</hi> managed with Vigour, and Addresse, still attempting
and prosperous: A <hi>Regency</hi> which hath the splendor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the most Illustrious Reignes. We behold a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority</hi>
Victorious and Conquering: A <hi>Minority</hi> respected by
Subjects, and dreadfull to Enemies: A <hi>Minority</hi> which is the
hope and support of the Christian VVorld. VVe see a
VVoman who diverts bad blasts, and changeth malignant
Constellations: A VVoman belov'd and follow'd by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
A VVoman the Superintendent and Directresse of
Victory. VVe behold a Child, who hath the Credit and
Reputation of Reigning Soveraigns. VVho is the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of Princes, and the Master of Nations; who ballances
and decides the Affairs of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these Prosperities, <hi>Madam,</hi> are after God the works
of your Piety, the fruit of your Devotions, and the reward of
your good Deeds. Your Oratory is the common Fortresse,
and generall Magazine of our Frontiers. It is the principall
Peece of our Campes, the most redoubtable to our Enemies.
In your Oratory, that is formed which destroys their Engins,
and disorders their Designes: that which takes in their Towns,
and defeats their Armies: And all our Victories commence in
your Cabinet, through your Zeal and Prayer, before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Generals, and the Valour of Souldiers compleat them
in the Field.</p>
            <p>By this way of Combatting you make a holy VVar, and
fight like a Christian <hi>Heroesse.</hi> Thus the good Angels and
blessed Souls fight in the behalf of Men: Their Piety is their
Valour, and their Prayers are their Weapons. And your
Majestie, who so profitably imployes this Victorious Piety,
and these combatting Devotions, merits no lesse thereby the
Name of <hi>Heroesse,</hi> and the Title of <hi>Conqueress,</hi> then if you
<pb facs="tcp:55122:6"/>
exposed your Person to the labour and toil of Sieges, to the
perils and hazards of Battels.</p>
            <p>Force is not so great as it is esteemed, for being cloathed
in Iron, for handling fire and steel, for making a breach with
Canon-shot. True and eminent Force is to defeat Armies by
desiring their overthrow; It is to demolish Citadels and Forts,
by bowing knees, and lifting up hands to Heaven: It is to
take in Cities, and to subject Nations by a Tear let fall a
hundred Leagues from thence, by a word which no man

            <p>Such was the Force of the Prophets, Generals of the Hosts
of God: Such was that of <hi>Moses, Gideon,</hi> and <hi>Debora,</hi> who
led the Elements, and Meteors to the Warres; who had Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Fortune in their Troups; who effected more by a
signe given by their hands, then could be performed with
armed Nations, and a whole world of Engins. Such was the
Force of the Victorious VVidow, who vanquished all <hi>Assria,</hi>
encamped before a City, and defeated it with a few sighes and
tears. It was like that of St. <hi>Hellen</hi> who overthrew <hi>Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

whose Alms and Fastings were the principall weapons of two
Raignes. Like that of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>otilda</hi> who preserved <hi>Clodoueus,</hi> inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in a disadvantagious Encounter, and repulsed the <hi>Germans,</hi>
who poured down like a deluge upon their Frontiers. And
even at present, <hi>Madam,</hi> this Force is the same with that of
your Piety, which at the foot of Altars performes all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Exploits of our field Armies; And which even in
your Closet gains Battels, and takes Towns in all the parts of
<hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this commanding and Victorious Piety is not the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Peece of your <hi>Regency:</hi> It is assisted by Prodence and
Justice, by the Graces and Magnificence, by all serviceable and
delightfull Vertues; And these Co-operating Vertues, acting
as they do, in the Spirit and by the conduct of Piety which
governs them, are indeed of another Elevation then those
which Act in the spirit of the World, and by the direction of
Morality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55122:7"/>
That Prudence which the VVorld inspires, is but a tutor'd
and disciplin'd Malignity, but a certain Venome tempered
with Flegme, and infused with method. Your Majestie puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
both within and without, hath nothing of Malevolent
or Imposture, nothing of captious or double, Dealing.</p>
            <p>The lights of your VVisdom cannot be false, comming
from so high a Region, and from so cleer a Source. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be defective, Marching with so even a pace, and levelling
at so elevated an End; nor cannot it be reproached, as having
either by mistake or weaknesse fixed it thoughts upon those
mean and inferiour Ends, which humane Prudence seeks in
Time, and within the limits of Matter.</p>
            <p>Justice meerly Morall, is, to expresse it well, but an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
VVilfulnesse, a wilde and cruell Habit, which lawfully of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends.
Its force is but a force of Obstinacy and unpliableness;
By striving to over-bend the Level it breaks it; It snaps in two
the line, by endeavouring to hold it too straight. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
often enough abused by the small distance between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of right, and the extremity of wrong; It acts great
cruelties where it thinks to produce great Examples. Your
Justice, <hi>Madam,</hi> illuminated and tempered by Piety, which
governs it, is equally remote from those two Extreams. It is
truely forceable and entire, but it is of a temperate and gentle
Force. It is of an Integrity like that of Laws which are far from
Cruelty and harshnesse, which are modest and respectfull.
And ordaining things with this Integrity and Force, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
Persons with respect, and sweetens in them the sense of
what may be the most rigid in its Orders. It cannot be said,
<hi>Madam,</hi> that the Law is a leaden Rule in your hands: It hath
there all the evennesse and solidity it ought to have: Nor can
it be said to be a Rule of Iron; It hath neither the weight nor
roughnesse thereof, nor breaks the things which will be no
more then adjusted.</p>
            <p>But there is no Law so rigorous which may not be sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Graces with which you Act. And Justice; nay the
most unflexible and vindicative Justice would alter its inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and countenance, and become milde and munificent in
<pb facs="tcp:55122:7"/>
their Company. In this I say much, <hi>Madam,</hi> and yet this
much is but a part of what may be said. VVe know the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the first Domination the VVorld hath seen, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
know, that they were the Graces which tamed
the cruelty of the first Men; which imposed the yoak upon
their necks, which made them love bondage and chains.
However this yoak was yet but rough-drawn; These chains
were rude and and unpolished: And the wonder is, that the
Graces which imposed them on Men, were then but unexpert
and half rustick. Your Majesties Graces are of a higher Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and have another kinde of Force then those other.
They are such whose commands oblige, and which are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to those they binde: They are such as alleviate duties, and
sweeten servitude; such as know how to polish the Scepter, and
temper the over great resplendency of the Crown. And, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
I shall not stick to say, that lesse efficacious Graces then
your own have sweetned Injustice, and set a pleasing face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Tyrannie.</p>
            <p>The Importance is, that these your Majesties Graces are
not onelie modest and disciplined, but Religious and entirely
Christian: Your Piety hath inspired them with devotion
and zeal: It hath sanctified them, and sanctified your Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Justice. And this sanctification of the Graces, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
is not a vain intertainment of the mind, nor an amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of unimployed Reason. Force is more necessarie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
then to the melancholy austerity of retired Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
Aud it cannot be but the effect of a continuall and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
labour, of an ever firme and attentive soul, to please
without intermission; to delight with seriousnesse; to be still
in good humour and of good example; to gain hearts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making any unseemly Advances, or hazarding one single
word of Indiscretion.</p>
            <p>Magnificence, which is an other Vertue attending on great
Fortunes, and great Souls, is governed like your Majesties
Vertues, by this directing and commanding Piety, which is
the Superintendent of your Life. It is no new thing to see
Magnificence at Court. It is Originary of that Country: There
<pb facs="tcp:55122:8"/>
it hath its Theatres and Exercises: And there is no private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so well provided with whom it suffers not inconvenience
and constraint. But to speak truly (<hi>Madam</hi>) it is very rare to
see at Court a well Ordered and Regular Magnificence, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
from Pride and Haughtinesse, cured of Ostentation and
Excesse, disingaged from sense and from the things it mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth.
And this Orderly, Regular, Spirituall and unclogged
Magnificence hath an other kind of force then Frugality,
Modesty, and Simplicity which are far remote from burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and ingaging Objects.</p>
            <p>Soveraignty, <hi>Madam,</hi> hath a splendor which sutes with its
own Condition. It hath lights which belong unto its Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and which you cannot lawfully extinguish. The Vertues of
your Fortune are of another Order, and ought to have other
Marks then those of your Person. And by a disposal contrary
to that of the Ark of Covenant, which was only covered
with skins, and adorned within with Gold and Purple. Your
Majestie may well reserve Modesty for your Interior, and
Humility for your Sentiments: but it owes Lustre and Pomp
to your Dignity: It owes a specious and splendid Exteriour
to the eyes of the World. This mixture of Splendour and
Modesty, and this alliance of appearing Majesty with a veiled
Humility, is the last form and consummation of Christian
Magnificence: And I know not <hi>Madam,</hi> whether in the
whole Course of your life there be any part wherein your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is more vigorous, or your Spirit acts more gallantly and
with greater Force.</p>
            <p>There is mauy times but a constrained and necessitated Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
nothing but an artificial and ill-looked Poverty in
what is stiled the Vertue and Power of private Persons. That
which is Humility under Sackcloth, and is Abstinence in a
Cloister, would be peradventure Pride and Presumption under
Purple; Ambition and Avarice in a Palace. True Power,
<hi>Madam,</hi> consists in floating as you do, above the abundance of
your Condition, and the plenitude of your Fortune: It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in conserving the elevation of your Soul, and the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of your Heart amidst an Infinity of Objects, which
<pb facs="tcp:55122:8"/>
sweetly ruine, and bind with pleasure. It consists in keeping
your self in a posture of mind like that of the <hi>Cherubius</hi> on the
Ark, who amongst Gold and Pretious-stones, in the midst of
Purple and Perfumes, turn not away their eyes from the
<hi>Propitiatory.</hi> In fine, it consists in preserving the Purity of
Intention, and the Rectitude of sight, in the most pompous
and resplendent Actions, and in Imitating the Planet-R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Intelligences, which look onely upon God, and aim at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but his Glory in the splendor of their Orbs, and amidst
the numerous Objects they convey unto us.</p>
            <p>These Vertues <hi>Madam,</hi> which are all Heroick and Royall,
have conjoyntly wrought upon the Statue erected unto You
in the midst of this <hi>Gallery:</hi> Magnificence hath furnished the
Matter, which is pretious and befitting the Merit and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Work. The Graces, I mean the industrious
and skilfull Graces have carved it, and given it all the Lectures
which a compleat Figure can receive from a perfect Modell.
Force hath received it from their hands, and raised it upon its
Basis. Justice hath graved the Inscription, and Piety hath
been the Overseer and Directresse of the whole Peece.</p>
            <p>These Artists are none of the common Artificers, nor
their works any of the Vulgar ones. Their hands transcend
those of the Ancient Sculptors: And the Eternity they are
to give, is a far different eternity from that of the <hi>Heroes</hi> in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the Gods in Brasse All these Gods and <hi>Heroes</hi> framed
by Men, are long since dead and buried: We scarce retain their
dust, &amp; some small fragments half consumed by time It belongs
only to the Graces and Vertues to work for Eternity. Not only
Years, but even Ages, more injurious then Years treat their
Works with respect: And yet at this day in the Books and
Memorialls of Worthy Men there are Ancient Pieces of their
Modell, which are as neat and entire, as if they came but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of their hands. The Portraitures they have made of
your Majesty, of what matter soever they be composed, will
be used with the same respect and esteem, they will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
and destroyed; they will be entertained and multiplied
by Time. And Posterity, even the least Curious, yea the least
<pb facs="tcp:55122:9"/>
Cultivated and rudest Nations will desire their Copy.</p>
            <p>VVhiles these honours and this acknowledgement of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
are in Expectation, be pleased <hi>Madam,</hi> that the most
Noble and Illustrious Part of Antiquity may honour you in
this <hi>Gallery.</hi> This will be no impure and tumultuary Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
The honours which shall be rendred you by so many
Wise, by so many Magnanimous, by so many gloriously chast
Women will not be disavowed, and unauthorized. Such
fair hands cannot present you but with most pure Incense, nor
make you other then beautifull and precious Crowns: And
nothing but just and melodious Acclamations, nothing but a
Harmony of Honour and Heroick Hymns, can proceed from
so many Soveraigne and well instructed Mouthes.</p>
            <p>This Veneration will be common to the Illustrious of your
Sex: But those of your Race and Name will bring unto it a
particular Zeal, as they have a Duty, a Part, and Interests
peculiar to themselves. And in the Crowd of so many <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esses</hi>
which will presse to be seen by your Majesty, the <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
and <hi>Isabella's,</hi> whether of <hi>Castile</hi> or <hi>Austria,</hi> will make
their Offerings and Vows remarkable amongst the rest. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<hi>Madam,</hi> they have a neerer Relation to you, and owe
you more then others: And the honour they have to Revive
in you, and to be <hi>Irradiated</hi> by your Reputation, is to them
a second Life more Illustrious then the First: It is to them a
temporall Beatitude, wherein they take more glory then in the
eternity they enjoy in History.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Madam,</hi> the Honour which <hi>Heroick</hi> Women shall
render you, will not be like those Ceremonies of the good
Goddesse wherein Men had no share: VVe shall be admitted
thereto in Common; we shall mingle our Duties, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
with theirs; their Incense and our own shall make
the same Persume; their Hymns and ours shall make but one
Consort. Your Goodnesse <hi>Madam,</hi> and our Duties, your
Vertues and the VVonders they have wrought, will be the
Subject of these Hymns. The Prosperities and Victories of
your <hi>Regency</hi> will be loudly sung: And Peace which is the
Crown of Prosperities, and ought to be the End of Victories,
<pb facs="tcp:55122:9"/>
will be the close of our Songs, and the accomplishment of your
Praises.</p>
            <p>Yes <hi>Madam,</hi> this Victorious and Crowned Peace, will be
the reward of your Pietie and good VVorks. It will be the
fruit of the Zeal and Conduct of those two Princes, who are
so Beneficiall and Glorious, either by the hazard of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the Field, or by their Abilities and sincere Intentions in
the Cabinet Counsell.</p>
            <p>Their Example will infuse Force and Vigour into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
of Counsell: And so many judicious and sharp-witted
Heads, which compose this Illustrious Body, will contribute
to the Conclusion of this Important Affair, the union of their
Judgements, and the harmony of their Lights. The chief
President of Justice, that Christian and <hi>French Cato,</hi> who
might make up a whole Senate, and whom we might oppose
to the Ancient Republique, will put his helping hand therto,
with that incorruptible Integrity, and that unlimited Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is the Hope and Ornament of this Reigne, and will
be the Example and Admiration of future Ages. I hat other,
so just, so well tempered, so well composed, and so charitable
wise Person, to whose care your Majesty hath committed the
Administration of your Revenues, will contribute thereto
that generous and pure Integrity, and that disinterressed and
faithfull Zeal, which have always carried him to the good of
the State, and the ease of the People. And if he hath been
able to sweeten the harshest part of his Ministery, if he hath
introduced Civility and good Offices into the Exchequer, and
reconciled the Graces with the Treasury, well may he also
sweeten the Asperity of Factions, well may he contribute to
the restauration of Tranquillity in the State, and to the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
of Peace thorowout all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Madam,</hi> I must not forget that so able and faithfull a
Minister of State, who assists you to sustain the burthen of
Affairs: He is one of our Chiefest hopes, and will be one day
one of the principall Instruments of the Peace we expect. The
spirit of Ancient <hi>Rome</hi> wherewith he is so abundantly endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was a spirit of Direction and Counsel, a spirit Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb facs="tcp:55122:10"/>
over Victories, and Arbitrator of Events. Heretofore all
known Nations, and the whole world that was capable of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
submitted to the Manners and Impressions of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
It ordain'd with Authority and Soveraign Power, both
Peace and War. It disposed the good and bad Fortunes of
Kingdoms, and made the temporall Destiny of Nations. Now
if this spirit was so soveraign and efficacious in rusticke Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
in half savage Consuls and in grosse and Illiterate Sages;
we cannot sear that it degenerats and grows weak in him who
is the Senator of the Christian VVorld; who is the Consul
of a spirituall and sacred Republique, who hath joyned acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with naturall Lights; who hath been polished both by
Ecclesiastical and Civil Sciences. The wheels of the State

               </gap>rdered rightly
and with addresse; nor can the Genius and Purple of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
which succeeds the Ancient Senate but give Force and
Dignity to our Affairs.</p>
            <p>It is not prejudiciall <hi>Madam,</hi> that this spirit be the spirit of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which was heretofore the Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> VVorld,
and which is at present the Head of the Christian. There is no
member to which the spirits of the Head are strangers: There
is no Countrey where Wisdom and Fidelity are not naturall.
And moreover the most Noble and perfect things, even those
that have most Vertue and Force, are not Originary of the
places where they Act Great Rivers have their Sources three
hundred Leagues from the Countreys they enrich and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.
Fire, Light, and the spirit of the Planets, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
so great effects in the low Region of this VVorld, are Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
of the Higher. The <hi>Intelligences</hi> were not created in the
Sphear they move. The <hi>Angel-Guardians</hi> of this VVorld,
are not of this VVorld. And your beautifull Soul <hi>Madam,</hi>
that Soul of yours so Noble and Munificent, so Elevated and
Royall, is but a Guest and Passenger in the fair Body it governs.</p>
            <p>It is not then <hi>Madam,</hi> Inconvenient or contrary to Justice,
nor yet against Order, that this rare Spirit should be to our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
what the Administring Spirits are to the Sphears and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
committed to their charge: VVe thence cannot expect
<pb facs="tcp:55122:10"/>
but a lesse defective, and a more harmonious Conduct; but an
Administration more disingaged from matter, and elevated
above the clouds of Interest; but a Tranquillity lesse casuall,
and more regular; but a Prosperity more generall and of a
larger Extent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>No, <hi>Madam,</hi> this Prosperity will not be a restrained and
particular Prosperity. Superiour Causes are not Nationall and
propriatory, they do no good which is not Universall: And
all <hi>Europe,</hi> even the whole Christian World will have their
share of it after <hi>France.</hi> Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Acknowledgement thereof will be
also common, and the Benedictions generall. Your Majestie
will receive Praises in every Language for it. And in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
of Praises, <hi>Madam,</hi> I may peradventure, be so happy as
to raise my voice above the rest, to give it a Body and light, and
to make it last with your Name and Memory.</p>
            <p>So excellent a VVork should not be unadvisedly underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and in a bad season: It should not be touched with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie

Serenity, as also fit and selected hours. I hope to enjoy them,
<hi>Madam,</hi> from the continuation of the fair dayes your <hi>Regency</hi>
doth promise to us.</p>
            <p>And I further hope, that the Graces which ingage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in all that belongs to us, setting their hands to this work,
together with the Muses, will joyntly draw your Picture, which
shall resemble you as neer as is possible.</p>
            <p>What I here offer you <hi>Madam,</hi> is but a rough Draught of
this Picture. Your Majestie may see in little the height of

which they have lest of it, shew cleerly, that they allotted not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
their recreative and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hours. If there there be any place
where their Doctrine is perspicuous and methodical; where Eloquence
is exact and vigorous; where Zeal hath sweetnesse and Force; where
the Graces are instructive and edifying; we must acknowledge it to be
in that part of their Writings. And these great Masters, who behaved
themselves so judiciouly in her other productions, have displayed all
their Art, and employed all their Capacity therein: Have acted there
with their whole Spirit, and poured forth all their Lights.</p>
            <p>The School-Master of <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> speaks alwayes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limely,
and like a great Doctor. But when he undertakes to instruct
Women, he is not satisfied with the Height and Solidity of his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but addes thereunto the Dignity of expression, and the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of words: He gives a Relish and Glosse to Sentences, Cadence
and Lustre to Periods. And the mixture he makes of Profit and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is so just and fitly tempered, as he seeme to say for delectation and
divertisment, all that be delivers for perswasion and instruction. There
is something of the same Greatnesse and Majestie in all the works of
S. <hi>Chrysostome:</hi> But this greatness is polished and cultivated; and this
Majestie hath certain Delicacies and particular Graces in all that he
hath written for VVomen: And not to say any thing of the Books he
composed either to instruct or confirm Virgins, or to comfort and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Widows, it sufficiently appears by the Letters he hath written to
<hi>Olympiada,</hi> that he dropped Gold from his Pen, as well as from his
Mouth; And that he took particular care to polish this Gold, and give
it a new Lustre and fair forms when he employed it for Women.</p>
            <p>The Fathers of the Latine Church have not less contributed to
their Institution then those of the Greek Church: And what
they contributed thereunto is not laboured with less Art, nor
seasoned with less Grace. Without citing the true works which
S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine</hi> have left us upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
Every one knows that to Women their choicest Letters have
been written; I say those excellent and learned Letters, which seem to
contain whole Volumes in few Lines, and great Books reduced into
Epitomies. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth not appear an <hi>Affrican</hi> in those quaint Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
All the rudeness of his Countrey is sweetned in them: They are
set forth with all the Ornaments of his Rhetorick. S. <hi>Jerom</hi> is not guilty
in his, of that Austerity, who seems not to have written but in Choler:
Not only the tartnesse wherewith the Criticks reproach him is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,
but the very Thorns of his profession flourish in them: And the
<pb facs="tcp:55122:12"/>
Stones of his Desert are there precious. As for <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> what he hath
composed there, appears wonderful by the sweetnesse of his Spirit
mixed with that of his Stile; and he hath left in them as many Rayes of
light as there be Sentences.</p>
            <p>I say nothing of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> who hath had Bees for his Nurses: And
who was, to give a true Character of him, an intelligent and discoursive
Bee. Every one knows that he hath inserted all the Honey of his
Hive into the Books he composed for Virgins, and into that he
addressed to Widows. The expressions therein are so pure, so exquisite,
and delightful, the sentences of choice and elaborate; and there is
every where so great a profusion of Flowers, as he thought fit to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
them by the Condition of those Persons to whom they were to be
presented. The most peevish and harsh of all Authors have written
for the Instruction of Women. I speak of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who besides the
Book he wrote concerning the veil of Virgins, hath composed another
touching the Apparel of Women, and a third concerning their Attires.
And if there be any harshness or asperity in those works, as in all others
of his Composure, this harshness is at least magnificent, and like the
riches of Barbarians: These asperities have a kinde of Dignity and
Splendor; They have something I know not what, which shines and
wounds; which resembles unpolished Gold, and misshapen Diamonds.</p>
            <p>The holy Fathers have not only applyed Moral Philosophie and
Rhetorick to the Instruction of Women, but have made Poesie and
the Muses serve to the same use. And those severe ones, who lived only
of pure Light and Spirit, did not conceive it unworthy the severity of
their Life, or the Sanctity of their Priesthood to measure Syllables, to
adjust Words, to paint and flourish their Discourses, to give a Relish
to their Doctrines, and Grace unto Vertue; to instruct by divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to make what is profitable passe under the Colour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adhel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> who was one of the most learned Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath
left us a Poem, where Virginity, Chastity, Modesty, Devotion,
and the other Vertues of Maids are adorned with all the Gold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Stones of <hi>Parnassus,</hi> which is the <hi>Peru</hi> of Poets. We have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
another of the same matter and form, which <hi>Avitus</hi> Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Vienna</hi> composed to Crown the Virginity of his Sister <hi>Fuscina.</hi>
And albeit this Crown be in the time of the first Lilies which were
sent into <hi>France,</hi> yet the Flowers thereof remain at present as fair and
fresh after twelve hundred Yeers, as if they were but newly gathered.
Thereby these two holy Bishops have rendred Honour to the Muses;
They have reconciled them to Chastity; They have sanctified their
Ornaments and Attires; They have done to them what <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
did with the Looking-glasses and Jewels of the Egyptian Ladies.</p>
            <p>My designe is not to assemble here all the Authors who have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
their Lucubrations, and Writings to the Instruction of Women.
The Assembly would be too great for so narrow a space; And it were
<pb facs="tcp:55122:12"/>
to make a compleat Library of a Preface. Such as I have alledged, are
sufficient to evince the Importance of this Instruction, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade,
that it forms at least the Moity of Christian Policy. Could
Doctors and Prelats so inlightned by God, so penetrated by the Unction
of the Holy Ghost, so purified and heated by the Fire of the Altar,
lose their Fire in unprofitable Productions? Have they consumed their
Time, and wearied their Hands to effect nothing considerable? And
would Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> himself have written to a Woman with the Pen of
an Eagle, wherewith he had written to the Angels and Churches of
<hi>Asia,</hi> wherewith he had made the first Draughts of what was before, and
will be after time; if he had not believed that a Letter written to a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
might be as Canonical and profitable, as Letters directed to Angels
and Churches?</p>
            <p>These Reasons and Instances more powerful then any other have
ingaged me in this Work. My Pen is not the Pen of an Eagle like that
of Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> I write not by the Wisdom and Light of the Holy Ghost,
as <hi>Solomon</hi> did. I have no Gold to employ like Saint <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> I fall very
short of the Idea's and Conceptions of the alledged Fathers. And if
these great Saints and eminent Men did not believe, that the matter
upon which I Labour was unworthy of their Capacity, and beneath
their Idea's; I ought not to fear, that it may appear Noble and Precious
enough for mine. And no man ought to call in question the Utility of
a Work, whereof so many Learned Hands have left such excellent
Models.</p>
            <p>It is true that I have given a new sonn to this matter, and altered the
Shape and Figure of those Patterns. There is a Philosophy more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and instructive then that Anatomized one, read in the Schools. Her
Attractives are modest, and accompanied with Force: she hath no affected
Dress; and having a more lovely Aspect, and better Fashion then the other,
she gives not less Edification, nor a worse Example. She doth not produce
like that other, crude and discoloured Axioms, formless and dry
Decisions. She Beautifies them with exquisite Inventions, with curious and
coveted Figures. She knows how to adde Lustre to Force, and to give
Grace and Dignity to what is solid.</p>
            <p>I conceived that my Designe might fall into the hands, and under the
direction of this Inventive and pleasing Philosophie, magnificent in Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
and rich in Designs. And to the end she might not have all the trouble
of the Work; I have to her, associated Portraiture, Poesie, and History,
which are three other illustrious and renowned Co-operatresses: and these
three, associated to this noble Superintendent, have framed this whole
Structure which I consecrate to the Publick, under the Title of <hi>The Gallery
of Heroick Women.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Title is not so limited, as it may seem to some who know not
Vertues but by the Draughts which Painters form of them; and do not
believe that there is any other Fortitude, then that which they see with a
Helmet on its Head, and a Pillar on its shoulders. This armed and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustious
<pb facs="tcp:55122:13"/>
Fortitude is but subordinate to another general one which assists
all the Vertues; which is present in all great Actions, which supports all
good Works, which is the Directress of all Heroes both in Peace and War.
It is to this Fortitude St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> attribute after <hi>Plato,</hi> the
Victories of the Spirit over the Flesh, those of Vertue over Fortune, those
of the Honest and Honourable Good over the Delightful and Profitable.
It is of this Fortitude <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks in that Picture, where the Heroick Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is drawn with so fair Colours, and Crowned with so magnificent an
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ogy.</p>
            <p>In effect, Temperate and Chaste Women require Fortitude: Loyal and
Constant Women need it: Modest, Reserved, and Devout Women need
it as much; And peradventure they require more then those presumptuous
and haughty Gallants, who fancy to themselves that they support States;
And that their Arms are the Pillars of Empires. Courage is necessary both
to bear handsomly the Chains of Marriage, which though never so well
gilded are yet painful; and to endure its Yoke, which is never so
smooth as not to incommodate; it is so needful to resist both pleasing
and frightful Passions, flattering and dreadful Objects. It is requisite to
regulate Love, even that Love which is Honest and Lawful. It is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to bridle Lawful Joyes and innocent Pleasures: to moderate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory
Sorrows, and Afflictions authorized by Nature and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom.
In a word, there is no Christian or Moral Vertue to which Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
is not required. And for this Reason my <hi>Gallery</hi> hath a larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
then the Frontispiece doth promise. There is room for all Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Women by what Names soever they are called: And the Prudent, the
Chaste, the Faithful, the Couragious, the Constant, the Pious may all
enter into it, and keep their degrees there under the Title of <hi>Heroick
VVomen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The assembly of these Gallant Women might be greater then I have
made it: And albeit <hi>Solomon</hi> was troubled to finde one single Heroick
VVoman, yet since his Time enough have appeared to Plant here a
whole Colonie. Of all this great Number I have chosen twenty of the
most Renowned all Illustrious amongst them. And not to produce
them confusedly &amp; in disorder, I have divided them into four Squadrons.
The first of Jewish Woman; The second of Barbarian VVomen, to take
the word Barbarian in the same sence as it was understood by the Grecians:
The third of Roman, and the fourth of Christian VVomen. I exhibite a
Picture of each; and the Subject of this Picture is taken from the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendent
and couragious part of her Life. Besides, these Pictures are not
meerly superficial, &amp; carry a bare outside like those of <hi>Philostrates</hi> who was
content to express what was visible; &amp; to copy out the draughts of the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
with the strokes of his Pen. They represent chiefly the Interior &amp; that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
part w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> cannot be disclosed or expressed but by Philosophers. They dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
all the Features &amp; Motions of the Heart, all the Postures and Colours
of the Soul: And the Scope of it which is wholly Moral, aims more at the
<pb facs="tcp:55122:13"/>
Manners then at the satisfaction of the Eye. Every Picture is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a Sonnet, which is another piece drawn in little: And the
Sonnet is seconded by an Historical Elogie, where the Life of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roess
is abbreviated, which serves for the Subject of the Picture. I adde
a Moral Reflection to the Elogie, which tends more directly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to the Benefit and Regulation of Manners. And there I mark
out what is most profitable and instructive in the preceding Example:
I establish practical Axioms, and draw from thence useful consequences:
I advertise Women of their Duties and obligations, and cause them to
take in by Grains and Drops the pure spirit of Christian Philosophie,
and the extraction of her Maximes, which they scarce receive but with
distaste, in Books where it is without seasoning and in grosse.</p>
            <p>In sequence of this Reflection, and in order to the Maximes which
are given therein, I propose a Moral Question, in which there is enough
to satisfie the Intellectual part, and to fortifie the Appetitive. And after
the having decided it to the advantage of Vertue, and to the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Women I desire to instruct; I confirm my Decision by
a Modern Example, which I take either at our own Door, or fetch it
from our Neighbours; to the end being seen neer at Hand it may make
the deeper impression, and act with more Vigour. Besides, these Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are all illustrious and Heroick: They contain great and wonderful
things: And I have chosen them of this form, to teach such as run after
the Fantomes of Romances; that Truth is not only instructive, but
also more delightful and divertising, then falshood; and that natural
Bodies are more Luminous and Graceful, then all the Apparitions and
Specters which Magick Art produceth. As for the Heathen Women
which I bring upon the Stage, I place them not there as perfect Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.
I know very well that their Vertues have been but rough drawn;
And that wanting the light of Faith, they remain imperfect. But
I know also, that such fair rough drawn Vertues are presented
there, as we may gather from thence wherewith to form excellent
pieces. And by the same reason that the Son of God alleadged <hi>Nin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve</hi>
against <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and proposed <hi>Tyre</hi> to <hi>Judea,</hi> one may alleadge the
Heathen and Barbarian against Christian Women: one may well
propose <hi>Pantheas</hi> to <hi>Catherins,</hi> and <hi>Zenobias</hi> to <hi>Agathas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I particularly declare, that I do not pretend to justifie the Death of
those who slew themselves with their own Hands: what Colour soever
the Philosophie of that time gave to their Deaths; and with what
paint soever the Poets have set them forth. If they had the Force and
greatnesse of Courage, it was enormous and disproportioned; it was a
greatnesse beyond limit or compasse. Nevertheless this doth not hinder
that these enormous and great disproportioned Women may have
something of imitation. One may frame by a <hi>Colossus</hi> a Figure of a
middle and very exact Stature. In Moral Philosophie as well as in
Logick, Errour may be serviceable to Truth: And a good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
may be drawn from a bad Principle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55122:14"/>
Behold what I had to say in order to the designe and structure of this
Work. I have nothing to adde to what hath been said, but these
few words with which S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> concludes the second Book he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to Virgins. Since the tasts of men are so different, and that there
are as many Opinions as Heads; If any Neatness and Care appear in some
places of my Discourse, those places can justly displease no Man: If
there be any mature and serious ones, they will please the Palat of those
in whom the Maturity of understanding accompanies the Maturity of
Age: If any be found flowered and delightful, they will not offend
such as are in the Age of the Flowers of Grace; and Men will grant
me, that it is no lesse necessary to write for these Persons then for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
There remains nothing more for me to say to the Reader. He
may enter into my <hi>Gallery</hi> when he pleaseth; The Door is open to him.</p>

and so adorn'd with the riches and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Nature, is the western Part of
Palestine. You cannot choose but know
it at first sight by that verdure which
makes it enjoy as it were a perpetuall
spring; And by those tufts of Palms and
Cedars which serve as naturall Garlands
to crown it. These Towns and Cities which appear afar off are
not built by the Israelites. They have as yet erected in this
Country nothing but flying Towns and walking Cities.
They have only built with Canvas and Cordage: All their
Houses have been hitherto but field habitations: And during
the obstinate and continual wars wherein they were imployed,
their thoughts were more taken up in rendring souldiers war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
and forming Captians; then in hiring Masons and making
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55122:16"/>
Architects. Besides at present the whole Countrey is fild with
the rumour of wars and preparrd against the Cananites. Ten
thousand men selected out of two Tribes, are rlready advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
towards Mount Thabor: And the men you behold in
arms about the great Palm are the most remarkable of the
people, whom <hi>Debora</hi> the Prophetesse and Governesse of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
retained with <hi>Barac</hi> to instruct them in the discipline of
war, and excite them to act gallantly.</p>
               <p>You never beheld a Tribunall like that of this Governesse.
Surely their enters more splendor and pride in the Thrones of
Kings, but lesse naturall Majesty and true Glory. This is
not the work of a year, nor the master-peece of a Carver: It
is of the Suns own modeling, that Illustrious and universall
Artist, which forms Mettalls and precious Stones. And you
may belie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, that having wrought a whole age to perfect it, he
hath not kept from thence that soveraign spirit, and those
pleasing Rayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which draw respect in dazeling the sight. The
greatest splendor and the chiefe glory thereof neverthelesse is
derived to it from <hi>Debora,</hi> who gave it her Name, and chose
it for the Seat of her Justice. The Graces when she gives Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
under this Palme, serve her son Herralds and Guards;
And at all the Decrees she pronounceth, every lease seems pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to crowne her words.</p>
               <p>Surely also no woman was ever heard to speak more sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raingly,
nor with an Authority, accompanied with more sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and efficacy. Prophesie and Law were never expounded
by a more powerfull Mouth. And it is a wonder that all the
Offices of Regal Dignity, being so weighty and combersome,
are not felt by so beautifull a head. She often gave Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and composed differences under this Palme: At present
she gives our Orders for the Combate, and exhorts her Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers;
and within a few houres you shall see her upon the head
of Troops joyning action to Command and contributing by
her courage and example, to the victory which she her self
had prophesied. Though you hear not her words, and that
even her voice doth not reach you, yet her very Countenance
is intelligible and perswasive: Her Gesture and Looks give
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55122:16"/>
vigour and lustre to her speech: And from her very eyes,
which are the two fairest peeces of her Eloquence, there
issues forth something, I know not what, of vigour and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which would make it self to be understood by the deafest
persons, and perswade the most incredulous; which would
even cast fire into the coldest, and excite the most drowsie and
stupid souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barac</hi> and the other chief Commanders by hearing her,
took a second courage and a new zeal. They fight already
in desire and thought; in the agitation of their hearts and with
the fiercenesse of their looks. The encounter is hot in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
and the vanquish'd enemies are forced to flie. There
is not a Souldier so ill armed, there is not a Commander so
little versed in war, who hath not victorious visions; who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
and without striking a blow puts not a whole Troop of
Canaanites to flight; who figures not to himself the possessing
the Head of their General, and the Crown of their King
loaden with chains. But as yet there is not one drop of blood
shed in their imaginary Combats; there is not a Launce bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
nor a dart thrown: And it would be fine sport to the
enemies, if they had no other defeat to fear. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
field of battel, and other dangers which attend them, they
shall have no occasion to defend themselves at so great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and to fight against Apparitions: And by a revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they expect not, and humane Prudence cannot
prevent, their fortune which they believe to be so well establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and guarded by so great a multitude of armed chariots
and offensive engines, will be suddenly ruined by two VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>See how this Palme already crowns one of them, she bears
not onely the Name of <hi>Debora;</hi> but seems to be animated by
her spirit, and to possesse like her a warlike soul and a prophetick
Instinct. Her verdant youth more gay and pleasing then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
is a presage of victory. Her very arms embracing the
Queen Regent applaud her promises, and infuse courage into
her Auditors: You would say that they congratulate her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Triumph, and demand for their share of the booty
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55122:17"/>
a Trophy of the arms of the enemies General. But behold,
<hi>Debora</hi> armed and ready for the Combat: her elevated arm
testifies the impatience of her zeal: and her heart appears al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
inflamed in her eyes and on her face. Her grace never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
is not altered by it; her animosity is becoming and
modest; and from this little fiercenesse, which is as the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or cream of choler, and a tincture of zeal added to her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
natural attractives, a third quality and a mixture of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and sweetnesse is formed, which will work a double effect
upon the Enemie, and at once, and in an instant imprint in
them, both terrour and reverence.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ISTORY doth not furnish us with a Gallant Woman more
ancient then <hi>Debora,</hi> to whom I give the first place in this
<hi>Gallery.</hi> She succeeded <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> and inherited from
the first, the Spirit of Prophesie, from the second, Courage
and military vertue: and from both, Authority and Magistracy. Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
excepted, she exercised all the Offices, and filled up all the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of that time: and out of her divided graces, a Prophet, a Judge
and Captain was formed. Her Audiences had something I know not
what of military: she exercised there a kinde of field Magistracy;
and gave them under a Palme of her own Name, which served her for
a Tribunal of Triumph, and crown'd her Decrees, as well as her Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories.
God having chosen her to break the yoke of his people, and
to redeem them from the bondage of the Canaanites, she assisted with
her Person in the battel given them by <hi>Bara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> and contributed her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
predictions and courage, to the glory of that day. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
thereunto even her last hopes: and though the were a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and that her husband had lest her but a spark of what remained,
(to make use of a sacred word) yet she hazarded in that fight with
this spark the resource of her blood, the foundation of her house,
and the seed of her posterity. I speak according to the sence of the
Doctors, who believed that <hi>Barac</hi> was the Son of this excellent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he became a Souldier and Captain under her discipline, and
had learn'd of her how to fight and overcome. So that in his time,
to joyn my words with those of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> a Widow was seen govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a holy Nation, a Widow distributing rights, and arbitrary duties,
a Widow mediating between God and his people; a Widow or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
peace and war; a Widow directing combats and victories, a
Widow leading an Armie, nay the Mother and Commandresse of the
General of an Armie. And the untractable and mutinous Jews, whom no
human prudence could govern in time of peace, faint hearted and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd
Jews, whom no valour of men could defend in time of war,
were reduced to order and military discipline, became docible and vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctorious
under the Regency of a Widow. The wonder is, and it must
be added here to crown her memorie, that no complaint was made,
not any fault found during this Regency. And the sacred Writ which
hath not concealed the defects of the Patriarchs, and hath published
to posterity the dissidence of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the imprudence of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi>
the incontinence of <hi>Samson,</hi> the fall of <hi>David,</hi> and the follies of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
sound nothing to reprehend in <hi>Debora,</hi> and left us only her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
and Hymns, her Laws and Victories. This example is wonderful,
and our sex hath reason to be jealous of it, there was in this woman
wherewith to form three great men: and this triple Spirit which was
given at once and in grosse, might satisfie for the government of three
Races, if it had been placed severally and bestowed by intervals.</p>

                  <p>FRom time to time such examples are seen, to the end we should
be advertised, that souls of the first magnitude may be found in
bodies of the second sex: that the instruments which God em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes
receive their vertue from his hand, and not from their own mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that the authority and impression of his finger upon what
faces soever merits respect, and requires obedience. We ought to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to those Powers he hath established, as we are subject to his Sun
and Planets. And as we undertake not to prescribe Laws to the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
and to order the course of the Sun, but leave them to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of those intelligences which move them, and equally bear and
without murmuring the sweetnesse and force of their influences: so

and undertake to judge our Judges and rule our Masters. We must not
degrade Authoritie, nor make our Soveraigns our subalterns. Let us rest
content in beseeching God to inspire them. And this prayer once made,
let us leave them to the inspiration of God and to the conduct of their
good Angels, who are their invisible Counsel. And what ever arives to
us from them, let us bear it with equality of minde, and remember
that there is no losse comparable to that of obedience.</p>
                  <p>Certainly if S. <hi>Paul</hi> wills us to be subject to superiour Powers, and
to bear even with our most rigorous and insupportable Masters, far
mote just is it that we submit to the Powers, whose commands are
milde and pleasing, and which are, like <hi>Debora,</hi> assisted by fair Vertues
and Graces. It seems that God acts more visible by those, and that
his Authority is more resplendant and appears most clearly through
theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The obedience likewise which men render them is commonly

                  <head>MORAL QUESTION.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Whether Women be capable of Government?</head>
                  <p>I Know very well that there be Politicians who are against the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Women; but I know also, that these Polititians are
no Evangelists, and that there is no Creed as yet made of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
The example of <hi>Debora</hi> is a famous and Prophetical proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Doctrine. It is adeclaration of God himself to which there
are no Axioms to oppose. And when we see a woman made the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernese
of his people, and the General of his Armies, a Woman who
gave Judgements, and gained Battels, a Woman who had the mission
of Prophets, and the Authority of Judges, which were then particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

be said that Women are absolutely uncapable of Government without
opposing the Sacred History, or accusing with contempt the choice
which God made of her for the ruling that Nation which he himself
hath sanctified.</p>
                  <p>States are not governed by a beard not by an austere Countenance:
they are ruled by the strength of wit, and with the vigour and activity
of reason: and Wit may be as strong, and Reason as vigorous in the
Head of a Woman, as in that of a Man. There are some Planets called
Males, and others Females. These are not lesse regular not lesse active
then those: they have not lesse light, nor are guided by lesse perfect
Intelligences. As for the want of heat, and the excesse of moisture
where with Women are reproached, besides that these are but super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
differences, which reach not to the soul, nor can place any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
between mindes; it will be granted me, that not the hot and
cholerick, but the cold and phlegmatick are the wisemen.</p>
                  <p>Let us say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> likewise that it imports not of what colour, or of what

the Law-makers and Wise men of <hi>Greece</hi> would have been Wrastlers.
That ancient Senat, which was the purest and most spiritual part of the
Roman World, would have been a company of Gladiators: and if now
adayes the Ministers of State were to apply themselves to wrastling and
running, we must choose them amongst Smiths and Seamen. I here have
been some weak and tender Princes, to whom the affairs of two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
seemed of no weight; and who governed both on this side and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55122:19"/>

                     </gap>
ones have been seen who bowed under the lightest, and were
disturbed with the most easy and gentle affairs. They might be
excellent Wrasile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

composed of the Arms and Feet of the State, and could bear all its

                     </gap> but they were not composed of the Head; they had not the
form, not could perform the functions of it.</p>
                  <p>It is not then the vegitable part which forms great Princes. The
good conduct proceeds not from the strength of the Arms, not from
the well closing of the Shoulders: the Stern is handled otherwise then
the Oa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Hatchet. Women as well as Men may have these hands and forces.

                  <p>Women are accused of excesse, inconstancy, and weaknesse: and

                  <p>Women cannot only reproach us with the Monsters of our sex which

hath thown to what height the understanding of Women may advance
in the Science of well governing. And though fortune made her not
a great Queen, yet Vertue made her a Heroesse, who gives place in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to those that make the greatest noise in History. I shall not need
to produce Testimonies thereupon, or to cite Books and Authors. Our
whole Age is equally knowing in the life of this wise Princess: her
memory is publikely honoured in all the Courts of <hi>Europe:</hi> nay even
such as were no Friends to her House, had for her the <hi>Castilian</hi> heart
and the <hi>Flemish</hi> spirit. They have applauded her in good earnest with
handsfree from the Dominion of <hi>Spain:</hi> and besides she is daily crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     </p>
                     <p>Her vertues were no shadowes nor parcels of vertues; they were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and perfect ones: vertues for every use and of every form: and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
is acquainted with no vertues which had not in her all their force
and extent. Though they have all an affinity with each other, yet all
of them have not the same resemblance, nor the same functions in the
civil life. There are some which are born with us, and are as it were the
advances and graces of Nature. There are some which must be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and are the fruits of labour and study. There are some which are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55122:20"/>
strong and vigorous, fit for action: there are pleasing and polished
ones which serve onely for shew. The Infanta possessed them all: and
what most imports, she had them all great, and in a condition to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
them with splendor.</p>
                     <p>First, she was born with this graceful Soveraignty, and by natural
right, which hath its title and force upon the face of beautifull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
and this Soveraignty is a powerful and very useful piece when it
is well managed: it governs by the bare aspect the most harsh and least
tractable hearts. It softens the hardest commands, and takes from
them what is biting and vexatious: it would infuse even mildenesse
and grace into Tyranny. Certainly it is not beauty which deliberates,
which judgeth, which enacts Laws and Ordinances. But the Common
people, for whom the most part of Laws and Ordinances are made, is
an Animal into which there enters more of the body then minde, and
which obeyes more by sense then reason. Likewise it is true that this
flower lasts not long, and appears only in the Spring: but saded Roses
retain full a good odour: And besides that the Infanta kept all her
life time certain remnants beautiful enough, of this first flower; these
very remnants were supported by so sweet and becoming a Majestie;
they were accompanied with so many graces and civilities, and so many
other flowers of the latter season were mixed with them, as no body
could well distinguish between them and those of Youth.</p>
                     <p>The Intellect is the eye of Wisdom, and the guide of all vertues. It
is the chief Minister of Princes, and their natural Counseller: and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
can effect nothing if it be not enlightned by it. The Infanta's
understanding was ranked amongst the most elevated and capable

There were no affairs so vast or weighty, which it did not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend

Counsellers were never busied to finde her wayes and expedients: it
was enough to give their approbation to those she furnished of her
own: and she never furnished any which were not advantagious, and
according to the measure of affairs. Besides this capacity of minde, and
this interiour prudence even borne with her, she used great care, and

her own.</p>
                     <p>Moreover this Capacity did not consume it self in vain speculations
in wandring and fruitlesse Idea's; it was active and attempting, bold
and laborious. And there have been some Princes of great repute, who
acted lesse Gallantly and with lesse vigour then this Princess. The
pains she took in Audiences is incredible: the never made affairs wait
upon her: never was her Closet or minde shut to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never did the
accuse them of importunity, nor complained of their crowding in.
Likewise she never remitted them to the care of her Officers: she was
as jealous of them, as if she had inspired them with understanding and
conduct, as if her hands had brought happinesse to them, as it they
had taken addresse and light from her presence. Secretaries were to
her rather Officers for shew, then use. She her self finished the most
difficult and important dispatches: and when it was needful to write
in commanding terms, and in a maiestical stile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it was necessary
to use the Character of Grace, and civil, and obliging expressions, she
did not pay with borrowed words, or hired conceptions, her minde
furnished her abundantly with all that could perswade Soveraignly,
and with Dignity, and with all that was capable of gaining hearts, or
taking them by force.</p>
                     <p>When she was resolved for the siege of <hi>Breeds,</hi> which served so long
for the exercise and spectacle of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and which was before the

wrote with her own hand for aid to all the Princes her Allies; to all the
Communities of the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> for Contributions and Convoyes;
to all the Commanders of her Troops to issue forth Commissions, and to
give out Orders. And it may be said, that all the chief Engines of this
famous Enterprise received from her mouth, from her hand, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
a spirit of Authority which infused vigour into them, and made
them act with successe.</p>
                     <p>She wanted not even courage and addresse in military affairs: but
her courage was bound up, and her military addresse restrained. And
had she not been so famous, and so very exemplar amongst modest and
pious women she might have had the first place amongst the valiant and
Heroick. It not suiting with her condition to sight with her hands,
she sought with manly counsels, and bold resolutions. She imployed
the valour of the heart and the courage of the countenance, where it
was not permitted her to use the strength of the Arm. She marched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
even into the mouth of danger, and expected it sometimes with
a steady pace, though only armed with the stability of her mind, and the
Dignity of her looks. Such as have written the History of the wars in

the Souldiers, and sent them to fight fortified with presents and

as if she had a desire to manifest thereby, (to use this saying of
the Poet) that the Goddesses can thunder as well as the Gods; and
that they have like them their Arcenals and Thunderbolts. Certainly
if it hath been said, that the military sweat of the first Consuls, and
those hands which tasted of Liberty, gave to the earth they cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
a stately secundity mixed with glory; I doubt not but the
Canons levelled by this I rincesse, received from her eyes and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
a second fire which gave spirit to the first, and redoubled its
force.</p>
                     <p>But her most usual dutie in her Armies was not to make breaches
and ruine walls, it was a wholsome and charitable duty: a duty of
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ety and mercy: and this duty contributed to victory: this mercie
assisted to the taking of Towns and the gaining of battels. Knowing
that there are some enemies more formidable, then those against
whom men arm and intrench themselves: and that the Canon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of Iron and Fire is lesse destructive to Armies, then necessities
and maladies, she took a particular care of the infirme Souldiers; she
caused them to be liberally and abundantly furnished with necessaries.
She disposed of her Jewels and moneys laid up for her trifling pleasures,
to provide them Drugs: and the lost hours, which another would
have imployed at play, and recreative walks, she imployed in furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them with pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

wounded. I have been told of some Princes who tore their shirts to
binde up their Souldiers wounds: I know the name of that Person
who once made his Diadem serve to the same use. But concerning this
matter I have learnt nothing, nor read any thing of Antiquity which
is not very ordinary, if compared with the Charity of the Infanta. It
is very credible, that the vertue of those Remedies was no ways weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by this Charity: and I doubt not but the Plaisters and Swath-bands,
which passed through so pure and beneficial hands, preserved
more Souldiers, then Casks and Curresses. Whereupon I call to minde
that couragious <hi>Victorius,</hi> who was called the Mother of Camps and
Armies. This name indeed is full of glory, and in my opinion of higher
value then the Statues and Triumphs of many Emperours: but of what
esteem soever it be, the Infanta deserved it by a better title then <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius:</hi>
she was not only the Mother of her Armies, but even the Preserver
of them: her charitable acts made them subsist, her presence and Piety
made them overcome.</p>

                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55122:21"/>
To these imployment of the field we must joyn the inclination and
dexterity she had in that innocent war and pastime which is used in
Woods, without effusion of human blood, and without leaving Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and Orphans. She there gave a little more freedom to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
and suffered its bounds to be a little more enlarged: we know
likewise that she there performed all that a most couragious and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
person could have done. And as if she had delighted in a danger
wherein she might be humanly valiant, and overcome without doing
hurt; she was seen to encounter chafed Wilde-boats with a jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin
in her hand; And to shew in this single sport a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> serious a valour
and as true courage as would have been requisite on a breach or in a
set Battel.</p>
                     <p>There is a haughty capacity and a swelling Pride: There is a savage
Courage and a magnanimity which would fain strike a terrour into
others. This alliance of vices with vertues was not observed in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta,
she was both modest and capable: she was humble and prudent:
and her magnanimity though high and couragious was yet sweetned by
a goodnesse victorious without Arms, and conquering without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
which gained her more hearts, then all the forces of <hi>Spain</hi> could
overcome. This goodness did onely acquire her the love of her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
but it gained her Subjects where she had no Jurisdiction: It
entertained her servants without Pensions or Wages. It made her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of a larger extent then her own Country. It made her reign of a
longer durance then her life. Besides it was an universal goodnesse for all
uses: a goodnesse without delay or resence: at all howers and in all
proportions: a spring of goodnesse which could not be exhausted by
any effusion: a goodnesse ingenious to do good; and to do it seasonably
and to the purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to do it with a good grace and Majesty.</p>
                     <p>It is wonderfull that this awful Princess, who at her pleasure gives li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to Fortune and Ambition, and extinguishes the most enflamed Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
it is wonderfull I say, that even death it self could not suspend
the inclination she had to do good: and the last breach of her life was
a spirit of grace, and an effusion of good deeds. She had received the
last Sacraments, and her soul strengthned with the bread of the strong,
and prepared by extream unction, expected only the moment of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring,
when she remembred that many petitions were remaining in
her Cabinet unanswered. These were petitions of the afflicted and
miserable, who were apparently in danger of never coming out of their
misery, if she drew them not forth before the alteration which her
death was ready to produce in affairs: she gave order that these peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
should be brought her; and causing her head and hand to be
raised up, she imployed all that remained of her sight and motion to
signe them in the best manner she was able. Surely she could not die
more gloriously, nor with a more noble and natural essusion of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And this makes me remember the Sun, which still enlightens the
Earth, and doth good to it, even when it is in the Eclipse. Thereby
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55122:22"/>
she supports whole houses which are ready to sall: she raiseth up some
which were already fallen: and this last trembling of her head sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
Communities and wrought the preservation of many Families.
This was the right way of reigning charitably, and exercising a most
benigne Soveraignty, to give pardons and grant favours in the very
sight, and even in the arms of death. This was the true way of
dying Royally, and after an Heroick manner, to rise up out of the bed
of death, that she might save Families from shipwrack which were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to perish, and to employ the last breath of her life, to make the
miserable revive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to restore them hope, goods, repose, and Fortunes
at the very rendring up her soul. Surely those ancient Heroes who
took a vanity to die standing, and to have their bodies upright, and
their souls elevated never died so nobly, nor in so good a posture.
And that Prince, the delight of Mankinde, who reckoned amongst his
acquisitions the goods he had bestowed, and counted amongst his losses
all those which were remaining, how thristy a manager soever he
were of favours and benefits, yet he never arrived to that height as to
oblige by his last breath, and to do good in the last motion of his
Soul.</p>
                     <p>There are forced favours and constrained benefits, which fall but by
drops: there are some which carry with them as it were the stings of
repulses and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll Language, and serve onely to distaste those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them. Nothing of this Nature came from the Infanta.
Her favours were without delay, and often prevented the asking:
they were all pure, and without thorns: and her benefits resembled
gold which should grow without earth and ordure: they were not only
of great value and solidity, but they had besides much lustre; they sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
the heart and dazled the sight.</p>
                     <p>This Grace of doing good was the particular character, and as it were
the proper Beauty and Mark of the Infanta. All her actions, I say her
most serious and vigorous actions were imbued therewith: her piety
it self had taken a tincture of it: and though her vertue were one of
the highest and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>reest from ostentation, yet she never did any thing
fiercely and with shagrin: she acted nothing which was not gallant and
civill, which was not done with reflection and study, which relished
not of quaintnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e and magnificence: Nay, it is said, that even her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venties
did not distaste; and that her very rigours were obliging.
Whereupon it is related, that when she was in <hi>Spain,</hi> a certain Knight
less wounded in his heart then head, having entertained her with some
discourses, into which there entred fire and adoration, the wise Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
who knew very well that there was something of <hi>Eudimien</hi> and
of the Moon in this man, had more pity then anger for him. And to
free her self dexterously from his importunities procured the King her
Father to give him an honourable employment attended with a great
Revenue which carried him far enough off from <hi>Spain.</hi> Thereby she sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
Vertue without exaspirating the Graces, and proved at once so
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55122:22"/>
rigorous and indulgent to this melancholly person, that with one stroke
she punished his love, and made him a Fortune.</p>
                     <p>Above all, this goodness of the Infanta appeared admirable in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
ruined Powers, in comforting great wounded Fortunes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Lustre and Dignity of eclipsed Planets put out of their
Houses and Courses. To perform the like acts of mercy, another sort
of charity is required then is practised in Hospitals: and the pain of an
ulcerated Prince demands other lenitives then the pain of a broken Leg,
and of an Arm cut off. The Infanta did sundry times such good deeds,
and her charities have ascended even to crowned Heads. Princes flying
to her for protection, and decayed Princesses found with her their
House and Rank. They found there preparatives and remedies for
their wounds, even pretious preparatives, and agreable and perfumed
remedies: and the Hand it self which touched them was so skilful, as
to charm their anguish, and to take away the seeling, and almost the
very remembrance of their falls.</p>
                     <p>Authority which is to Princes a Crown without matter, and a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of invisible Majesty; which is in them a vertue that acts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
motion, and procures them obedience without force or violence:
This Authority I say, which is formed out of the vertue of a Prince, and
out of the esteem of his Subjects, was soveraign in the Infanta, and
alone affected more then all the Engines of <hi>Spain</hi> assisted with all the
Mines of the <hi>Indies</hi> could have done. She neither wanted Armies nor
Cittadels to support her Commands: and what she did with two words,
another could not have done with four Cittadels, and as many Armies.
Her Subjects obeyed her intentions, what marks soever they had of
them, and by what mouth soever they were declared. Even strangers
and enemies honoured her Name, and had for her, submissions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
and compla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>All these vertues of Peace and war which became familiar and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
to the Infanta, which assisted her in her Closet, and followed
her in the field, were under the conduct of another superiour vertue,
and of a higher discent. I speak of Religion which is the Tutresse of
States, and ought to be the Superintendent of Policie. That truly was
the predominant vertue of this great Princesse: but it was not a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
and timerous Religion, a Religion of scruples and apish fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
much lesse was it of those artificial and painted ones, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and fit themselves for shew, which have studied looks, and tears
of reserve for the publick, which deride in private the masked part
they act in Churches. The Infanta was solidly religious, and even with
vigour of spirit: she was humble and submissive to God without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
she dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aded him with that respectful fear which is the only
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55122:23"/>
fear of the wise and constant. Noblenesse and Dignity were to her so
inherent, as they entred in a manner against her will into all her good
works: And in her least devotions there was a tincture of Majesty,
and some thing I know not, what which had a touch of the greatness of
her birth. And surely to speak my thoughts of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Great men are not
permitted to be lesse devout then mean persons: and crowned heads
owe no lesse subjection to God then others. But the devotion of Great
ones ought to be more magnificent and resplendent, then that of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
persons: And crowned heads even in their submissions, and
when they humble themselves have a lustre and motion of dignitie
which others want. The fire of the mountains which God himself
hath touched is another kinde of fire, then all those which are enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
with the sat and moisture of the valleyes: And the majestical
submission of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>alm, bowing under the weight of its fruits, renders
far more honour to Heaven, then the lightness of a reed under the first

                        </gap> it.</p>
                     <p>As the greatnesse and dignity of the Infanta assisted her piety, and
had their place and share in all her devotions: so her piety entred into
all the actions of greatnesse and dignity which related either to her
quality or office. It had the first rank and principal Authority in her
Counsel: It was present in the beginning and end of all her enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises;
It gave them the platforms and designes of all that was to be
executed, both within and out of her Dominions: And what propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
soever was made either for Peace or War, it was alwayes the first
heard. This Piety had likewise its part in the liberalities and profusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Infanta, and dispensed them so Christianly and with so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
a Charity, as they overflowed even into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ouses of the poor.
By this means Churches and Hospitals became the festival recreations

mercy as well as magnificence did honour to the publick. Even diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements
and pastimes were practised in the sight of this piety proper
for all uses: It brought thither order and discipline: It took from
them even the indecency of gesture, and the immodesty of discourse:
It only left them a serious and regular gallantry, and a most pure and
spotlesse joy. Affairs were also blessed and prosperous in the hands of
so religious a Princesse. <hi>Flanders</hi> was never more happy then in her
time: And it hath been very evident since her death, that war and ill
fortune bore her respect while she lived. But the vertues of this great
Princesse detain us too long: behold more matter then is requisite to

polish her self by practise, and to adde to so excellent a nature, as to a
rare and valuable matter, perfect habits, and exquisite and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Court of <hi>Florence,</hi> where adversity furnished her all it could with the
best impressions, and most exact and fairest forms. A second marriage

by <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, who had less regard in this choice to the

and to the conservation of his Patrimony of seventeen Provinces.
They remained yet all in peace and obedience when the Dutchess of

work and full of reputation, wherein she had Kings for her Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers,
and was looked on by all <hi>Europe</hi> with astonishment. It was
likewise to the wise and speculative of that time a wonderful spectacle
to see a woman wrastle alone against so great and dangerous a storm.
Yet she got the upper hand at last: and after nine yeers of agitation,
she brought back the vessel into the Haven in despite of the windes
and tides, which had forced it out. I say that she was to wrastle alone
against the storm; because the Councel it self had begun the trouble,
and the Ministers hired to save the vessel were the first that split it, and
made way for the waves.</p>

of Miracles and of prodigious Adventures, hath never seen
any thing of like Courage, nor of greater Fame.</p>
               <p>The joy she felt at the successe of so high an enterprise adds
new lustre to her eyes, and a second grace to her face. The con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fidence

the same time he pushes with his arms as it were to force her to
give back: and by a contrary effort he seems willing to carry
her away with his head. His heart strives within to succour
the wounded part, and not being able of himself to assist it,
with all the remainder of his force, he conveyes thither Anger,
Rage, and Despair. These impotent and furious Passions appear
confusedly, and with horror on his face swollen with the blood
and spirits which are there poured out from the whole bodie.
It would be hard to distinguish them by their proper features,
and by the Colours which are natural to them: All of them
have participated of the Anguish which is mingled with them,
and are grown either pale with Death which entred by this
wound, or red with the blood which flowed from thence.</p>

death to him. But the third yet more sensible and cruel death
was, that his enemies in his very presence and sight rejoyce at
his death and at their victory.</p>
               <p>Surely also this sight may be called the death of <hi>Sisera,</hi> and
the wound which he received therby in his heart though it cast
forth no blood at all, is yet more painful to him then that of his
pierced head; You would say that he is ready to dart out of

his mouth a thousand Blasphemies against Heaven, and as
many Imprecations against <hi>Jahel;</hi> But his voice is stifled with
the presse of his passions, and dies in his throat; There issueth
forth of it nothing but froth, which is the blood of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
rage, and not being able to blaspheme with his tongue,
he blasphemeth with his countenance and the motion of his
lips. <hi>Debora</hi> and <hi>Barac</hi> look upon him in silence, and with a

This good and couragious Princess was no way frighted at the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of so many swords already staind with blood, and even reaking
with the murther which was newly committed at the door. She boldly
advanced before her husband, and alone acted the part of al the Archers
of his Guard: But the match was too unequal, and fidelity being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
and without arms could not resist a multitude, nor overcome an
armed Furie.</p>
                  <p>The King being thrown on the ground, the Queen cast herself upon
him, and covered him with her body, to the end at least he might not
be wounded but through her wounds, nor receive death but through
her own: Her Sex was not respected, the Vertues and Graces of
her person proved no Sanctuary to her: she received two blows
upon her husbands body: and these furious Murtherers having at
last by Violence taken her from him, the poor Prince being man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
all over with wounds, rendered up his soul in the tears and
blood of his wife; The Author of this execrable Patricide, and
the cruel executioners who had assisted him with their hands, carried
not far the blood of their Prince. Divine Justice, and the revenging
Angel of Kings followed them by the track and voice of this blood
which cryed out against them; and there was none of them which was
not brought to condigne punishment: there was made the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in several spectacles, and the people had full leasure to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
and to glut themselves with their punishment. The detestable
Earl of <hi>Ath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e</hi> was reserved for the last act of the Tragidy, which lasted
three dayes; in each of which he appeared under several Engines of
torment and terrour, with a Crown of hot iron upon his head. And
thereby unfortunatly and contrary to his own sense was verified the
vain prediction of a woman, who had assured him, that he should be
one day solemnly crowned, and before a great assembly of people.</p>
                  <p>We may learn by this History that the Majesty of Kings is sacred;
that their blood and lives are holy things, and that there is in Heaven a
particular Tribunal, and selected Executioners established against those
who violate them. From hence also it is learnt, that the end of Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is commonly bloody and tragical, and that it is a dangerous thing
and full of hazard to commit crimes and to attempt upon the promises
of a Fortune-Teller. In fine to return to my subject we are taught
thereby that the strength of hands is not necessary for the force of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that delicate and polished Graces can do as much as couragious and
strong Vertues, and that Women are no lesse capable of an Heroick and
eminent fidelity then Men.</p>

hath placed in them doth dazel the sight; but even her very feet
contributed to the victory, and the eyes of her Buskins have
surprized <hi>Holofernes</hi> by the eye, and enslaved his Soul.</p>
               <p>These arms, though divinely reinforced and purified with
a Heavenly ray, could not have overcome alone. They
effected nothing but after prayer, fasting, and tears. And
though these which are spiritual, and of an invisible temper
have not wrought upon the sight of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> yet they have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55122:31"/>
done it upon the heart of God, and opened a passage whereby
Safety came upon his people, and Death upon his enemies. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi>
is ready to give a beginning to both, The exterminating
Angel who assists her, puts not a Lance of Fire into her Hand,
nor the point of a Thunderbolt brought down from Heaven;
such noble weapons, and descending from so great a height are
not necessary for this execution: And God doth not use to
leave to the haughty the title of a glorious and renowned
death. He presents to her the sword of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> and
putting it into her Hand, he setled confidence and boldnesse in
her Heart. You would take this fatal sword for the stroke of a
Thunderbolt: you would swear that it is all composed of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
But these lightnings are not like those which are formed
in the clouds: they come to it from a Diamond and a Rubie
whereof the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which is ready to imploy it. You would say that it glittereth
from the impatience it hath to be serviceable to a stroke, which
will be worth many Battels, and which shall be heard by all
Ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Judeth</hi> receives it couragiously and with confidence; but
her courage is far from fiercenesse, and her confidence appears
modest and submissive, Her faith renewed in this perilous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and her zeal breaking forth, enlighten her face, and
diffuse themselves by her mouth. And her eyes are lifted up
toward Heaven, as if they did shew the way to the prayers she
sends thither in silence and accompanied with the spirit it of her
tears. There is nothing which so pure a soul, and so holy
tears may not obtain; and the voice of this silence is too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and pressing not to be heard. But though it were strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to penetrate Heaven, and to make it self to be heard of
God, yet it reacheth not the ear of <hi>Holofernes.</hi> Beast that he
is, he is far from waking at this voice, he would not awake at that

hath not only lost both spirit and motion: but even his hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as a Guard about her person at the door of the Tent.
Her Angel Guardian lights her with a Torch, and at the same
time bowing down the Pike of <hi>Holofernes</hi> (which he had
seized on) seems to assure her with his looks and gesture that
he will second her, if her hand should fail. Observe the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these Angels who sport with a cask and Cuyrass: There
is a mysterie in their Action, and what they sport at, is the
assurance and instruction of <hi>Judeth;</hi> They break in pieces the
Armer of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> which was thought to be all composed of
solid Fires, and of well tempered and well hammer'd Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and which was so long the general terrour of all <hi>Asia:</hi>
In breaking it, they deride the infirmity of human powers;
and you see that they shew the pieces of it to <hi>Judeth,</hi> to assure
her that there is nothing to be feared, having guards and seconds
to whom Diamonds and Steel are but Glass and Tiffany.</p>
               <p>As for those whom you see at the door of the Tent, they
stand there to chase away fear and apparitions from this Maid,
whom <hi>Judeth</hi> placed there for a Guard. They remain in
that place to repell the Devils, Enemies of Gods people, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55122:32"/>
might come to the aid of <hi>Holofernes.</hi> Their arms though seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
obscure are yet composed of a Celestial and most resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
matter: but because lightnings might issue from them
which would awaken the whole Camp, they themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured
them and suppressed all their light. Neverthelesse this
restraint is no longer needfull for them. Behold <hi>Judeth</hi> coming
forth with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bodies, which are half dead with wine and sleep, and
which shall quickly be dispatched by the <hi>Israelites.</hi> The blood
still reaks after the sword, and where it passes, the earth greedily
drinks up the drops which fall from it.</p>
               <p>You believe indeed that the joy of this Victory is not little
in the heart of the Conqueresse: It is there so great as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
on her face, and her eyes have received thereby a second
fire with a new and accessory light. It will suddenly appear far
greater in <hi>Bethulia</hi> where the generous Widow is impatiently
expected: and to which place she is going to carry, with the
Head and Death of the Publick Enemy, the life and freedom
of all the people.</p>

off the Head of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> and raising the siege of
<hi>Bethulia.</hi> This part of her life hath been indeed the most
radiant and remarkable, but peradventure not the most laborious or
Heroick; and she more easily defeated <hi>Holofernes</hi> invironed with a
whole Armie, then Pleasure and Grief, Covetousnesse and Fear, then
her own Beauty and Youth. She was victorious nevertheless in all sorts
of conflicts, and got the upper hand both of pleasing and terrifying

she had inherited their Faith and Constancie: This first Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
being mastered, the overcame also Idlenesse, Pleasures, and the
latter Affections, which are the second and most dangerous Enemies
of young Widows. She not being able to renounce her Youth, nor to
be rid of her Beauty, which were to her like suspected Domesticks, and
hard to be preserved: she kept them continually shut up; and likewise

Besides these pleasing and flattering enemies certain cruel and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

miracle; and if it took no effect, she was to passe through all the hands
of a furious Army; she must suffer all the punishments and Deaths
which inraged Tyranny can inflict; she measured all these punishments,
and numbred all these Deaths: And upon a serious consideration of
them all the undertook in their very sight and presence this memorable

                  <p>The next day the General of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet, thinking to be at
the Fight, came to the Feast of it. The People being richly cloathed,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55122:36"/>
and the Magistrates in their ceremonial garments went out to meet
him, and brought to him their Deliveress in Triumph. He caused her to
come before the Armie raing'd in order upon the shoar. And there after
the having Crowned her with an Elogie, which was of more value
then the Laurel, or the Oak of the Ancients; He ordained that every
Souldier should make her a present, and offered her for a Husband
what Captain soever she would please to chuse, with promise, that he
would prevaile so with the Senate, as he should be adopted of the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nory,
and her Marriage Portion given her out of the publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury.
<hi>Marulla,</hi> who was truly bold and couragious, yet more advised
and discreet, rendred Thanks to the General for his Presents and offers;
and made him this answer, <q>That the difference was great between the
Vertues of the Field and those of a Family; that an excellent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain
might make a bad Master of a Family, and that Marriage
being no Warfare, the Hazard would be too great, and the Election
too rash, to chuse a Husband in Arms, and to take him in a Field of
Battel.</q> This Answer set a second Value upon the Act of <hi>Marulla:</hi> and
made appear, that there was a great deal of light in her Fire; and that
her valour was both spritely and Juditious: and from that time, they
looked upon her, not only as an <hi>Amazon,</hi> equal to those represented
in Fables, but esteemed her also as a learned Person amongst the
Muses.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Combat you behold, though it
be bloody on the one side, and cruel on
the other, yet it is none of those where
Valour should be brutish, and commit
murders. She is very resolute and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious;
but she is disarmed and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
In like occasions the weak become
strong, the dying victorious; and they
that strike and kill, were the vanquished. The Combat is for
the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> for the Law of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
and Prophets. On the other side this cause is defended
by abandoned and naked Faith, and on the other, assaulted
by Infidelity, armed with Engins and punishments. The match
seems to you to be unequal: And you will hardly believe, that
Infirmity and Tendernesse, can be of more Force then Iron
and Fire; that a Mother weak both in Sex and Age, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
both abandoned and unarmed, should vanquish a furious
and armed Tyrant, and overcome all the Executioners of his
Train. Nevertheless they subdued them all, and there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
on their side as many Victories as Deaths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salomona</hi> was present at all these particular Combats: All en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
that you see her, she hath already delivered up six parts of
her heart; And I believe that she is now come to her last
Childe, and to her seventh Crown. Her face bears as many
Victories, as Years. There is something I know not what, of
venerable and August in her wrinkles: and you would say
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55122:38"/>
that even the Law it self is come out of the Propitiatory in
humane shape, to infuse Zeal into her Followers, and to teach
them Fidelity and Constancy.</p>
               <p>Certainly Beauty, whatsoever is said of it, belongs not only
to Youth. Vertue is graceful in every Age, Her flowers are
of the latter season as well as her fruits: And whether by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
right, or by an Immemorial Priviledge, she hath ever
preserved the advantage of being at once, both Beautiful and
Ancient, and of having charms under gray Hairs and wrinkles.
You will profess at least, that she hath commanding Attractives
in this half dried up skin, and upon these withered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heeks:
And you will be as much inamored of these venerable Ruines,
and this Heroick and generous Caducity, as of adorned Youth,
and a scandalous Vivacity.</p>
               <p>Besides, do not believe that her Constancie is blinde and
obstinate; it is fortified with Sence and Reason, and its solidity
is resplendent, and penetrated with light, as well as that of the
Diamond As if she were not furnished enough with that
which is intrinsical and diffused from her own Spirit; A light
more vigorous and pure, descends to her from Heaven, which
infires her Heart; and her heart being inflamed with this fire,
seems ready to issue forth of her Eyes to receive it, even in its
source By the Charity of this Divine Light she came to know
the short and ruinous Carreir of time, and the Immense and
sollid Extent of Eternity: She hath seen the Waste
and Defects of Fortune through the Paints and Disguises
wherewith she varnishes her self: And one Single Ray mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
extinguished in her apprehension all those Piles of
Wood which are set on fire for her self and Children, and
made her discern afar off, in the hands of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
the Crowns prepared for them.</p>
               <p>Illuminated by these Lights, and fortified by this Object,
she hath already overcome even six Deaths: and behold her
wrastling with the seventh, which assaults her by the youngest
and last of her Children. There is tendernesse indeed on that
side, but nothing of weaknesse; and this last part of her Heart
in being the most innocent and lesse fortified by time shall not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55122:38"/>
be the less invincible. The Tyrant thinks to gain upon her by
that way, but he was not well acquainted with her: He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
himself, that at least with this single drop of blood which
was left her, she would preserve the hope and restauration of her
Posterity. But the blood of the <hi>Macchabees</hi> would not endure
the least stain for its Conservation: and so holy and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Race could not end more honourably, then by seven
Martyrs.</p>
               <p>She was far from contributing her voice and Carresses to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and from becoming the Temptress of her Son, she for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
his Minde, and strengthened his Courage: she discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him her Bosom and Breasts, which are reasons so much
the more powerful, as having the more tendernesse: she shews
him the Heavens open, and the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> a Spectator
of his Conflict, with the Patriarchs and Prophets. I think
also that the spake to him of his Ancestors the <hi>Macchabees;</hi>
and made him understand, that this great Light, is that, of their
Conquering Souls, which are descended to assist his Victory,
and to finish by his Constancie the Glory and Coronation of
their Name, the Triumph and Sanctity of their Race.</p>
               <p>The Couragious Youth heareth her with a manly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie:
his Resolution is visible already in his Eyes, and gives a
Color to his Face: His Constancie in Punishments will quickly
shew, that he is twice born of this Heroick Mother; that he
is no less the fruit of her Heart, then of her Womb; and that
he hath sucked with his Milk the Spirit and Quintessence of
her Vertue, and the very blood and Marrow of her Soul. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now assaulted by large Promises and magnificent VVords,
he only opposeth his silence to this vain Battery: and one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Head, accompanied with a Gesture of Scorn, over
turns all those Mountains of Gold which are offered him. The
Tyrant being irritated thereby bites his very Lips; wrath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
new Fires in his Heart, both for the Mother and the Son:
Some sparkles of them are seen already to issue from his Eyes,
and smoak out of his Mouth: and two great stacks of wood
will suddenly be here enkindled with his Breath, and the Fire of
his VVrath.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:55122:39"/>
Mean while <hi>Salomona</hi> rejoyceth at the Courage of her
Son, she animates him afresh to the Combat; and proposeth
to him the Example of his Brothers. She shews him their
souls already crowned, who remain at the Gate of Heaven,
staying only for his, to begin their Triumph. Those are their
Bodies which you see amidst the Executioners and Tortures.
Of six, two of them have been delivered up to the Furnace
incompassed with Fire; and the four other have been divided
between two great Caldrons. They live no longer, and yet still
resist; They seem to contest with Insensibility, which is to
them, as it were a second Constancy, and a natural Force, which
their souls have left them at their Departure. You would say,
that they had a mind to make shew of a distinct Virtue from that
of their mindes, and to possess their labours and merits apart in
this common cause: You would say, that every member hath
a Heart peculiar to its self, and a particular life to expose. Their
blood, though shed, retains still its vigour; There issueth
thence a smoak which proceeds from the fire of their Zeal;
nay, even their flead skins, and their lopped off Feet and
Hands retain still something of the Spirit of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi>
and seem to seek a second Victory.</p>
               <p>There remain none about them but these two Executioners.
All the rest are out of the Combat and have lost their Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with their Forces. The Fires which have been kindled to
consume these Holy Victimes, are overcome by the Divine
Fire, which hath left them nothing but the exteriour to burn:
Neither do I know whether they respect not the very marks
which appear upon these bloody and torn reliques: Surely they
owe this and more to that Fire, superiour to all others; And the
impression of Charitie ought to be at least in like reverence,
and no less sacred then the impression of Lightning. Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Flames of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Furnace had this discretion,
either Natural or Divinely inspired. They respected the three
Jews, whom Faith and Charity had consecrated; And by
a violent breaking out, like that of a Lion, who should leave
his prey and fall upon his Keeper, they devoured those Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Impiery who kindled them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:55122:39"/>
But nothing but Miracles of Courage and Patience will be
wrought here. God will permit the Consummation of the
Sacrifice, and receive all the Smoak of it. <hi>Salomona</hi> her self
who hath hitherto fought but in heart, and been only tryed
against Compassion, shall be suddenly tryed against Grief.
By the same Force wherewith she restrained all her Tears she
will pour out all her Blood. She will overcome Cruelty, as she
hath vanquished Nature: And after seven Deaths suffered in
Minde and by Piece-meal she will endure the last, which shall
be the Recompence and Coronation of all the rest.</p>

approaching to God by this elevation, and consequently illuminated
by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that Providence which governs it, doth not repiningly, and with fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse
receive that part of events which is assigned her; she acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates
herself by degrees to the rules of this vast Family into which
she is entred: she performs her part of the consort, and contributes
at least her resignation to the designe of the great Workman, and to
the general harmonie of his Work. Concerning Hazard and Fortune,
knowing very well, that they are but Figures which Errour hath
painted and set up; and that none but Children and Ideots regard
them, she equally de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

happens to her of good or ill, she receiveth it with the same sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of Mind, and acknowledgeth therein the care and goodness
of the Father who sends it her.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the soul is purified by this elevation, and disburdens herself
of matter: And the neerer this elevation approaches her to God,
the stronger and more vigorous she is, the purity also which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
thereby is more exact, and her disingagement more perfect; she
is thereby lesse capable of material passions, and can raise her self to
such a degree, and unite herself so close and straightly to the first spirit,
that being made one spirit with him, she forgets the allyance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of her body, and assists indifferently and as a stranger to its sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
and joyes.</p>
                  <p>In fine the Soul brought back by this elevation to the spring of life,
and led into the entrance of Eternity, which is promised her, learns to
contemn these little Moments which roll within the Circle of time,
and mark out to every one the space and length of his life: And so far
is she from apprehending Death, or being affrighted at the sight of its
terrible Arms, that she looks upon it as her Deliverer, as that which was

this unfortunate Marriage. King <hi>Henry</hi> omitted no kinde of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to gain this learned and wise old man, who was grown white in
the Service of the State, and had spent fourty Years to the Honour of
his Countrey and Time. But all his temptations proved weak, and his
Offers as well as his Threats returned back to him without effect. The
Chancellor was stronger then all the Engins which were prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him: the Prayers and Tears of his afflicted and mourning Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
were not able to move him. The Engins and Rage of an inflamed
and furious Tyranny could not alter his resolution.</p>
                  <p>He had a Daughter called <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was no lesse the Daughter
of his Spirit, then of his Body; He had formed her with his Tongue,
and polished her with his Pen: He had imprinted in her by degrees and
in divers Figures, the Flower of his Learning, and the Spiritual part
of his Soul: And he that shall represent to his imagination an exact
Graver, and jealous of the perfection of his Work; who should spend
Dayes and Nights about some rare piece of Marble, which he designes
for one of the Muses or Graces, will have a right imagination of the
Cares and Assiduity which this good Father had shewn in the instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this excellent Daughter. His Cares also proved successeful, and
his Assiduity was very fortunate: And if it be a common saying, that
Books are the Children of their Authors, one may well say that this
Daughter was the most learned and polished Book which issued from
the Minde of Sir <hi>Thomas Moor.</hi> His <hi>Vtopia</hi> and other Works, which still
live, are but in one Language and of one matter, That other Piece
was both Greek and Latine, Prose and Verse, full of Philosophie and
Historie.</p>
                  <p>Of all the Family of Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> there was scarce any but this
Woman learned and couragious, who went not along with the Time,
not was pliable to Interest. She was singularly beloved of her Father;
and a few Words of her Mouth, accompanied with as many Tears
would have battered him more dangerously then all the suborned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55122:42"/>
of <hi>Henry:</hi> and all the Engins of Schism. Neverthelesse these so
powerful words, and these forcible Tears which might have shaken him,
were all imployed to confirm him: Friendship and Tenderness fortified
his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith, and gave Courage to his Constancie: And the Piety of the
Daughter added to the Zeal of the Father, and finished his Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> being Prisoner in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where
he was visited by God alone, and had commerce with none but the
<hi>Muses</hi> which suffered with him; his Couragious <hi>Margaret</hi> caused a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Letter to be spread abroad, in which she feignedly seemed willing
to gain him to the Kings Will, and procured leave by this innocent and
charitable deceit both to see and serve him. Being received into the
Tower she left at the gate, with the person she had taken upon her, the
resentments of Nature, and the weaknesse of her Sex, and entred with
the pure Spirit of Christianity, and with a couragious Faith prepared
for the Combat.</p>
                  <p>So far was this Daughter from tempting and assaulting him with the
Ruines of his tottering House, that she represented to him the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of his suffering for that Cause; that Men and Angels were Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
of his Victory, that he had the Applause and Congratulation of
the Church, and that the Glory of his Family was raised to the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Martyrs. She spake nothing to him which he knew not before;
but she said nothing which did not confirm him. Old reasons received
a new light from her Tears, and issued with more vigour out of her
Mouth. And whether God placed in her Voice and upon her Lips
some tincture of Divine Spirit, whether pleasing persons have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Charm, and an Eloquence without Art; or that their sole presence
is perswasive. It seemed as if an Angel appearing to this <hi>Moor,</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
him with more Zeal, or infused into him more Light. In fine
having received the Sentence of Death after Fourteen Moneths of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
and an illustrious and solemn Confession of his Faith,
made in the presence of all the Ministers of the Schism, his good
Daughter was willing to be a spectat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her self by the Evidence of his Faith, and with the last Act of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie,
she expected him in his passage, and went to imbrace him in
the midst of the people, who gave back out of respect, and with their
Admiration and Tears honoured so resolute and so examplar a Piety.
At these last imbraces the fervour of friendship mixed with that of
Zeal, ascending from her Heart to her Head, caused some Tears to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still
from her eyes. But these were couragious Tears, and such as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
the first Heroes of Christianity shed upon the wounds and
Crowns either of their Fathers or Children still warme with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.</p>
                  <p>After the execution of the impious sentence, which had submitted this
High Judge of Equity to the sword of a Hangman: <hi>Margaret</hi> prepared
her self to tender her last duties to the Bodie of her Father. Concerning
whose Head after it had served a whole Moneth for a spectacle of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55122:42"/>
upon <hi>London</hi> Bridge, she bought it of the Executioner, and caused
it to be inchased in Silver; to the end it might remain with his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
the Relique of his Family, and of her Domestick Devotion.
Notwithstanding, this Devotion wanted not Accusers, and was pursued
by Justice. It was made a crime of State, that they might have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to persecute Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> even after his Death, and cause that
part of his Heart and Spirit which he had left to his Daughter to suffer a
second Martyrdom. She was made a Prisoner, and examined before the
Schismatical Tribunal: But she shewed so much Constancie in prison:
she answered so prudently, and with so great courage: she made so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and a noble confession of her Faith, that the Commissioners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
being become her Admirers, conceived it much fitter to send her
back, then to give a second Victory to her Father, and multiply Martyrs
and Crowns in his Family.</p>

                  </gap>alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Jasper belongs to the Palace of
<hi>Herod:</hi> And it can be no other then
<hi>Mariamne,</hi> who comes out of it with so
much splendour, and so sumptuously
apparelled. There needed no Diadem
and Sceptre to make her known; Her
Dignitie is neither Artificial nor bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed:
It is from her Person, and not from her Fortune.
And her Heroick Stature, her Majestical Countenance, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Beauty came from the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> as well as her Blood
and Courage. Can you believe, seeing her so Beautiful and
Resolute, that she is going to Execution? She goes thither
most fair and undaunted as you see her; And all the Graces and
Vertues accompany her to that place. Bloody and murtherous
Judges, suborned by her Husband, Mother, and Sister in Law,
come to give the Sentence of death against her. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
before this Tribunal of Tyranny and Injustice, with a
Countenance of Authority, and a Soveraignty of Heart
equal to that of her Face. You would have said, that the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
was to pronounce the Decree; and that the Lives of the
Judges were in her Mouth. But as good Intervals stay not with
sweetned Tyrants, nor with charmed Vipers; so malice and
poison quickly return to the Judges of Iniquity. Their fury
which Innocence and Beauty, equally Imperious, had chained
up with respect, is loosned and confirmed; And they at last
pronounced her Sentence, but still with Fear and Trembling.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55122:44"/>
As if their Faces had accused their Consciences and given
the Lye to their Tongues; As if their very Tongues had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
what was done; their Palenesse and stammering made
a Declaration contradictory to their Decree, and justified
condemned Innocence. In what manner do you think she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
this unjust Sentence, and procured by her own Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?
With more Equality of Spirit, with more Indifferency
then she could have received his Carresses. And had it been
but a feigned Death they pronounced against her, she
could not have appeared lesse moved. She is come hither with
all the Calmnesse of her Heart: the Reproaches and Injuries
of her wicked Step Mother, who combined with her
Enemies did not provoke her. And had she gone to a publick
Sacrifice or to some solemn Feast, She could not have carried
thither a better composed Modesty. Since it is decreed that she
must die, she resolves to die resolutely, and like a <hi>Macchabee.</hi>
And there will not only appear a Constancy in her Suffering,
but even a Dignity and Grace. Pitty it is nevertheless, that so
perfect a Light should be extinguished at its high Noon, and
in the midst of its Carreer: And the Mists must needs be very
thick and malignant which could not be dissipated by it.</p>
               <p>But we amuse our selves in bewailing her, we lose her last
splendour, and the last examples of her Vertue. She is already
arrived at the Place of Execution: And the envious <hi>Saloma</hi>
hath so violently pressed the Execution, that at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
I speak, there is an end of poor <hi>Mariamne. Herod</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is come too late to save her: His Retraction was fruitlesse:
They left him not so much leasure as to suspend the wicked
Sentence, or to keep back even for one moment the Arm of
the Executioner And repentant Love which brought him
thither, found nothing but sorrows to vent, and unprofitable
tears to shed. Affrightment, Horror and Despair entred into
his Soul, at the sight of <hi>Mariamne</hi> dead Spite, Anger, and
Jelousie, at the same time issued from thence: And the marks
of these Passions mix'd at their encounter, caused this distemper
in his Eyes, and the Confusion you behold on his Face. His
Bodie half reversed, and his arms extended follow the posture
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55122:44"/>
of his Soul, which remains as it were in suspence between
astonishment and aversion, between the respect and horrour
of these deplorable Reliques. He was willing at once both to
remove his sight from thence, and to sacrifice himself upon
them for the expiation of just blood, by blood that was guilty:
And to Immolate the jealous Penitent to executed Innocence.
He wished that he were able at least to tear out his Heart, and
to rid himself with it of his Crime and Punishment. His Eyes
besieged by a Death as yet warm and bloody, and by two Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
equally frightful, finde every where Torment and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
               <p>Me thinks this Fury strikes Fear into you. Surely she is fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
And the most Resolute and Heroick Souls, even
those which deride Death with all its disguises, cannot behold
her without Trembling, if she appears to them. Of these
Serpents which you see upon her Head, some raise sinister
Reports, and bad Rumors; others infuse suspitions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusts:
There are some which steal in by the Eyes of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands:
others which enter by the Ears of VVives. The
fairest Flowers wither as soon as they are touched by them.
The best united Hearts are severed, if never so little bitten by
them; and from their mouth doth fall, as well the Gall which
imbitters the sweetest Humours, as the Venom which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
the fairest Flowers of Marriage. The Torch which she
holds in her Hand is no less pernitious, then the serpents about
her Head. All the bad Colours wherewith the most innocent
Actions become darkned, are compounded of this Coal. Her
Smoak obscureth the purest and clearest Lights, and draws
Tears from the fairest Eyes; she robs the fairest Faces of their
Lustre and Attraction; Her Fire seizeth on both Souls and
Bodies, she causeth Frenzies and Calentures, and even in this
Life she makes Devils and damned Souls. All this teacheth
you, that this Furie is Jealousie, and Enemie of the Graces, and
the Corruptresse of Love. She is come as you see, to act her
second part, and begins to revenge that Murder, to which she
her self did instigate. All the Serpents which are wanting on
her Head, are about <hi>Herods</hi> Heart, and even tears his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55122:45"/>
The Bloody sword which she shews him is a dreadfull
Looking-glass to his Imagination. He beholds there, the horror
of his Crime, he sees there, the wounds of his Heart and the
stains of his Soul.</p>
               <p>This Apparition indeed is frightful: but the incensed Ghost
which ariseth from this beautiful Bodie is much more: And
<hi>Herod</hi> suffers an other fire, and other stings then from the
Torch and Snakes of the Furie: His wandring and troubled
Eyes change their station at every moment: They are obsest
with these two Spectres, which haunt them every where: And
thinking to repose them upon this dying Beauty, wherein
heretofore consisted his chief Happinesse, he findes there a
Tribunal and Scaffold; his condemnation and punishment.
His Yesterdayes Idoll is to day his judge and Executioner.
This just Blood which still reaks is, a devouring fire which fills
his distemper'd Imagination, and there comes out of it Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Complaints, Outcries of Reproach and Vengeance.
These cold and tyed up Hands tear his Heart in pieces: and
this Beautifull Head which caused all his joyes and happy
dayes, is now the Principal part of his Torment. Mean while
she hath only changed place: the blow which cast her down,
hath not shaken off her flower: her Grace and Beauty are
thereby a little faded, but not defaced: And her open and
still <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rene eyes seem to expect another Death, as if there needed
more then one to extinguish them. Thus the eclipsed Moon
is still fair, and the Sun sets daily without losing one single
Ray, or changing Countenance. The mischief is, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Moon recovers her defections, and is cured of her Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
and the Sun riseth again the next day after his setting;
there is no renovation of Light or a new day to be expected for
<hi>Mariamne:</hi> And this Beautiful Head is fallen in her own Blood
never to rise again.</p>

great in her, Birth, Beauty, Vertue, Courage, nay bad
Fortune. She was the Grand-Childe of Patriarchs,

Picture stood in Competition with <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in the Heart of <hi>Anthonie.</hi>
Her Vertue neverthelesse did not consent to this concurrence; and
being far from thinking on forbidden Acquisitions, she never dained
to put any constraint upon her self, for the preservation of that which
she lawfully possessed. Her Chastity was so severe, and so little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
outwardly, that there remained within something I know
not what of stately and piccant, which exasperated <hi>Herod,</hi> and made
him return to his own Nature. But she was the same to the bitings of

struck off without paling her Brow, or displacing her Heart. Her
Constancie did not begin by her punishment, it began by that which
is termed her good Fortune. Having espoused a jealous Tyrant, it was
requisite for her to be as couragious in the Palace, as in the Prison; and
Resolution was as needful for her under the Diadem, as under the
Sword. The Blow which struck off her Head was less her Death then
the End of her punishment: for one Crown it cut off, it brake a dozen
chains, and it was a Redeemer and not an Executioner which delivered
her from <hi>Herod.</hi>

                     <hi>HEROD</hi> glorious and tormented, and <hi>Mariamne</hi> crowned and
unhappy teach us, that the greatest Tranquillity is not found in
the Highest Regions of the World. There are no priviledged
Territories, nor exempt from Malediction: Many sufferers are seen in
Prisons and upon Scaffolds; but the worst treated Persons remain in
Pallaces and upon Thrones. These nevertheless cause more Envie then
Pitty. The People admire what they ought to lament; and when there
is occasion of drawing the Picture of Happiness, they represent her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Throne, and place a Scepter in her Hand, and a Crown upon
her Head.</p>
                  <p>But the People are ignorant Judges, and very unskilful Painters:
Every day they judge at Random, and without knowing the Cause;
Every day they vent Chimaera's and Caprichio's for well regulated Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.
They sufficiently understand of what matter Crowns are made;
and discern well enough how they glitter: but they know not their
weight and asperity, nor see from whence they wound. They assist in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
at the Sacrifices which are offered to crowned Fortunes: They
keep an account of all the grains of Incense which are burned to them:
but they assist not at their perturbation and torments. They see not
the Wheels, nor the Nails wherewith they are pricked; and lesse also
do they discern the fire which is put into their wounds. They have a dim
sight, and an Imagination filled with a Stage Felicitie, which hath only
a fair Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k and a purple Garment made meerly for shew: but they see
not all the tears which trickle down under this specious disguise; not do
they see the Wounds which bleed under this Purple.</p>
                  <p>Let us learn then, not easily to subject our Opinions to our Senses,
never to esteem things by the Exteriour, to make more account of a
sweet and peaceable Mediocrity, of an obscure and silent repose, then
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55122:46"/>
of a bitter and turmoiled Greatness, then of a punishment magnificently
attended and exposed to the view of the people. And let us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that this so common saying delivered by a gallant Person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Fortune of Labourers may be spoken generally of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Fortunes: They would be happy if the advantages of Medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie
were known unto them.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the Death of <hi>Mariamne</hi> which was the Crime and
Punishment of her Tyrant, it teacheth us that Jealousie is a dangerous
Beast; that it makes no distinction of Persons; nay, spares not him that
foments it: That it is that ungrateful and cruel Serpent which leaves
nothing intire in the House of its Host. And that if the fire be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished
with Sulphur, if Wounds be not Healed by Lancing them,
it is a very dangerous Experiment, to think to extinguish Spight with
Choler, and to cure the bitings of Jealousie with the Teeth and Nails
of Crueltie: There is another Reflection to be made upon this Picture;
but it will serve as matter for the ensuing Question.</p>

<hi>Mariamne</hi> is not the first upon whom this observation hath been Made:
History entertains us only with sad adventures of unfortunate Beauties.

God hath ordained even in Nature it self which is governed by so just

                  <p>But besides Honour and Dignity, the Benefit thereof in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
is great: And it is principally in Regard of those Excellent
Persons that this old Proverb is verified, which saith, that Adversity is
Instructive, and that Afflictions are better then Doctrines. First they
are preserved thereby in Christian Humility, and are cured of a certain
interiour and secret Pride, which is the ordinary Disease of Beautifull
Women. They learn at least, that the Divinity wherewith Men treat
them is but a Poetical and Stage-Divinity; That the Reverence which
is rendred them is but a Mask or Play: And their understanding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by Adversities is not easily corrupted by the Smoak of the Incense,
which their Adorers offer to them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover they are advertised thereby that God hath not made them
for the Earth: and that Heaven is their proper Region, as it is the
Region of Spirits and Light: And surely if that Prince would not
be accounted wise, who should cause his Statue to be made of Gold,
and placed in a back Court or Stable; can these so perfect reatures,
which are the Fairest, and most pretious Images of God, believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Blasphemie, that they have been finished with so much Care to
adorn only the low Storie of the World, to Beautifie the Region of
Disorder and Misery, the Element of Thorns and Tears? God hath
made them then for his Palace, nay even for the Highest and most Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
part thereof. And because he will have them there most pure
and spotlesse, he puts them in the fire of Afflictions which purifieth
them from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Castile,</hi> will no longer believe that Vertue is a Charm against
Disasters, nor that the Graces are able to inchant Fortune.
This Princesse who had Whitenesse and Beauty even in her Name, was
of those Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>cs, which the Holy Scripture represents unto us besieged
with Thorns. She was of those Pearls which were drowned in Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and abandoned to Tempests. All her dayes were serene, and all
hours sweet and quiet under the Climate of <hi>France:</hi> and by a Destiny
contrary to that of Roses, which have prickles onely upon their stalks,
and must be first gathered to be Honoured; she was Happy and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
whilst she was a Maid, and lived in the House of <hi>John</hi> Duke of
<hi>Bourbon</hi> her Father. The Tempest, Bitterness, and Tragical Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her Life, began from the very Moment of her Marriage with
<hi>Peter</hi> the Cruel, King of <hi>Castile.</hi> Certainly also the Allyance was too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal,
and the union too ill made between Innocency and Cruelty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a most pure Grace and a Devil composed of Blood and Durt.</p>
                  <p>Before <hi>Blanch</hi> went into <hi>Spain,</hi> the Prince had no longer any Heart
to give her; <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Padilla</hi> was become Mistresse of it: and whether
it were by Conquest or Usurpation, she reigned there so absolutely, and
with so great a Command, as all the Authority of the Queen her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and all the Favour of <hi>Albuquerque</hi> her principal Counseller, were
needful to dispose him to the Consummation of the Marriage. The
Wedding was not celebrated; it was tumultuary precipitated, and
done in silence without the least Shew or Pomp. It was rather a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Act then a Feast of Joy; and if this forced Prince brought to it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but discontent and aversion; the unfortunate Princesse assisted
there with the Spirit of a Mourner, and the Countenance of a Victime
designed to Death. They had not been two dayes together, but <hi>Peter</hi>
resolved to leave her. He could not live content far off from his Heart,
and his Heart was in the Hands of his Mistresse, who laid a charge
against him for marrying <hi>Blanch,</hi> and threatned him as a Rebel Subject
and a fugitive Slave.</p>
                  <p>The Queen his Mother, and his Aunt <hi>Elenor</hi> being advertised of his
Designe, replaced before his Eyes the wrath of an offended God, the
ill opinion of his scandalized People, and the incensed Arms of <hi>France.</hi>
He loosneth himself from all these Chains, he overcomes all these
Obstacles, and rides post where his Love or his wicked Devil called
him. After some Moneths dedicated to them both, he returns to his
Wife, drawn by the earnest Intreaties of his Mother, by the good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> by the Counsels and Sollicitations of his Grande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

But he returned to forsake her two dayes after, and to give her by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Divorce, a second Wound more injurious and sensible then the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55122:48"/>
former. The noise of it was great, and the History also saith, that this
so violent aversion was wrought on him by a Charm; and that a Jewish
Magitian corrupted by <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Padilla's</hi> Brothers, fastned this Charm to

                  <p>Whatever it be, this Cruel King not only left his Wife a second time

                  <p>This barbarous and unjust Treatment of the Fairest and most Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Princess of her Age, was a Scandal to all <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> sent a
Legat armed with Excommunications and Anathema's, to set at Liberty
oppressed Innocence, and to punish the Incorrigible and Scandalous
King. The Princes of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Aragon</hi> made a League with the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants

in hand this Cause: And the King being a hunting, a Spirit appeared
to him in the shape of a hideous and frightful Shepherd which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him with Divine Vengeance, if he recalled not his Wife. All this
did not mollifie the obdurate heart of this Prince: On the contrary
being perswaded that the Life of <hi>Blanch</hi> was the Fatal Fire-brand which
nourished all these Fires, and that they would be all extinguished with
her. He caused her to be impoisoned at <hi>Medina</hi> in <hi>Andalo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by a Couragious and Magnanimous Piety, she knew so well how to joyn
Devotion to Patience and Incense to Mirrhe, as she sanctified her Prison,
and made it a House of Sacrifice and Prayer.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether any Princess was more perfect then this: but in
all appearance, there was never any one lesse happy; she was Espoused
in Mourning, she was a Widow during Marriage: and the Wedding
day, which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

her accomplished and pure, and it was his good pleasure, that Adversity
and Constancy should give her the last Hand, and that Princesses should
learn by this Example, that Martyrs may be made as well between Balli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and under a Cloth of State, as upon Scaffolds and Amphitheaters.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU see that it was a remarkable Day,
which proved Fatal to vanquished
<hi>Lydia:</hi> And which was like to prove
no lesse to Victorious <hi>Persia.</hi> The
Blood runs still from the Wounds of
these two great Rivals: And the
Earth is covered all over with the
pieces of their broken Armies. But
<hi>Lydia</hi> was not acquit for a little Blood
and some sleight wounds. She lost there her best Men; and such
as remained were put in Chains It is not yet known how For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and the Conquerers will despose of <hi>Craesus.</hi> He was newly
driven by Force into his Capital Citie: And his Riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of fighting in his defence and preservation were taken and
led Captives with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Persia</hi> also did not purchase this Important Victory at a
cheap Rate: she lost there much of her pure Blood, and a
great number of useful and precious lives. <hi>Abradates</hi> was the
most generally Lamented: His Death, though Illustrious, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured
this fair Field, and mingled Mourning with Triumph.
And even in the fruition of Victory, it made victorious <hi>Cyrus</hi>
to sigh, and drew tears from his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>yes. If we had come one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sooner, we should have seen these Noble and Generous
Tears trickle down: they would have taught us that the Eyes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55122:50"/>
of Heroes are not Adamantine Eyes; And that the Vulgar are
deceived, who take great Hearts, for Hearts of Brass. <hi>Cyrus</hi>
then bewailed <hi>Abradates;</hi> but he did it magnificently, and
after an Heroick manner. His tears were followed by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of Riches, which will be presently burned with the
Dead: And he is newly returned to the Camp, to give out
Orders for the Funeral Pomp, and to make choice of the
Victimes which were to be Immolated to the Ghost of his
Friend. He believes him still in the Field of Battel, where
he enjoyes his Reputation, and numbers the Dead and his
own Victories.</p>
               <p>As for these sad Preparatives and Funeral expences, they
are made for the Consolation of <hi>Panthea,</hi> no less then for the
Honour of <hi>Abradates.</hi> But <hi>Panthea</hi> is no longer in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Comfort her self with burn'd Purple, or Gold consumed
to Ashes; with the Smoak of a Flaming Pile, and the Blood
of a Butchered Flock; with the large shadow, and great Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of a vast Sepulchre. Her Grief was too violent to expect
such Superficial and VVeak Remedies; and to be cured by
Ceremonies and Superstitions. She had Recourse to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
of less Cost, and far more Efficacious: She believed
that a small Piece of Steel plung'd into her Bosom, would be to
her Sorrow a more Infallible and Speedy Remedie, then
Mines of Gold, and Quarries of Jasper, erected into Pillars and
Pyramids over her Husbands Bodie. And this Remedie,
which she conceived the most speedy and Infallible, she newly
took couragiously, and with a boldnesse which merited to be
reserved for a lesse Tragical Occasion.</p>
               <p>Behold on her Face the Confidence of her Spirit, and the
graceful Composure of her Grief. Every thing is very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
to Beautiful Persons: Their Sorrows and Angers look
handsomly; Their Tears adorn them, and their very despites
Beautifie them; And there is nothing even in their Maladies
and VVounds which appears not Decent; There is not any
thing even in their Deaths which seems not pleasing from their
Attractives, and shines not from the same Lustre which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisheth.
That of <hi>Panthea</hi> hath nothing hideous or gastly;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55122:50"/>
you would rather take it for a sweet Sleep, then for a violent
Death. The Graces themselves, if there be any such as Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Poets describe, could not sleep more modestly: And
a Flower which the North Winde hath withered, could not
more gently bow down its Head, nor die more gracefully.
It is not likewise a Palenesse which you see upon her Brow and
Cheeks; It is a tincture resembling that dying Brightnesse
which appears in a Clear Cloud when the Sun withdraws his
Beams from it Trust not her Eyes though they begin to
close: The Fire Burns still, even when it is extinguished: And
the Sun being in the Ecli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

offend the sight. The like may happen to these dying Eyes:
The Sparkles which fall from them retain still a kinde of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and He it: and I do not doubt but if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and that one of them should enter into his Heart it would in

that through what art soever it passeth, it will passe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously,
and depart victorious and through a fair gate. It is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
neverthelesse, that it will sally forth by the nearest Gate
to the Heart, and which she her self newly made with her own
Hand. A stream of Blood which goes before this great Soul,
prepares the way: And spurting up even upon the Bodie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bradates,</hi>
enters there through all his VVounds, as if it would fill
his empty Veins; as if it would even penetrate his Heart, to
reinkindle the extinguished Fire; and dispose it, by the Spirits
which it brings to receive the Soul which was to follow them.
Her Countenanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> though languishing expresses joy at this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.
Her life seems to passe in good earnest with her Blood
into her Husbands Bodie: and her Soul is assured to finde
there a second Abode, which will prove more happy then the
former had been.</p>
               <p>Comforted by this Vain and sweet Imagination, she let
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55122:51"/>
fall her Head upon the Head of <hi>Abradates.</hi> You would say
that she prepares her self to expire upon his Lips: And that
after the transmitting into him her Blood and Spirits, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
to place her Sighs and last Breath upon his Mouth. Love
supports her in this Action: But it is an Heroick and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
Love, a Love which instructed her in Vertue and
fortified her Courage. For Loves, if you are yet to learn it,
are not all Wanton and Voluptuous There are Austere and
Chaste Loves, there are Valiant and Philosophical ones: And
amongst them, Glory and Vertue have their Confederates and
Disciples, as well as Vice and Pleasure. He that assists <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>
with so much Care, is one of these Confederates of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and Disciples of Glory: It is he that strengthened her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Temptations, and the Courtships of <hi>Ariaspes;</hi> he that
inspired her with Chastity, and Conjugal Faith; he that taught
her to apparel her self with the Reputation of her Husband, and
to Adorn her self with his Victories: he that perswaded her
rather to love <hi>Abradates</hi> glorious and dying with a good
Name, then living and Infamie.</p>
               <p>This manner of loving Gallantly, and like a Heroess was
indeed according to <hi>Abradates</hi> own Heart: And you see in
what Posture he set himself to correspond therewith We
have not seen him in the Conflict breaking a Squadron of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi>
and pursuing the Victory in a Warlike Chariot;
But we behold the Glorious Colours which he brought thence,
and received even between the Arms of Victory. It seems
that his Valour could not die with him: At least it appears
still heated in his Wounds, and stately on his Face. The
Rich Armour which his Generous Wife had bought him
with her Pearl, was pierced thorow in divers Places; as if a
great Soul could not fally forth by one single passage. The
blood which trickles down from thence is mixed with the
blood of his Enemies, wherewith he is covered, and seems
willing still to overcome. All things have in him, some Mark
of Honour and Generosity: And even Death it self is bold
upon his Brow, and resembles Victory. In this so glorious
and Mournfull Condition, his Vertue begot Pittie even in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55122:51"/>
those to whom in the Conflict it had bred Emulation. It was
Honoured by the Blood of Enemies, and by the Tears of his
Rivals: by the terrour of the one, and the affliction of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And immediately a sumptuous Monument erected over
his Bodie and that of <hi>Panthea,</hi> buried in the same Garment,
will be to each of them as a second Life and an Immortalitie of
Jasper and Porphire.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>ANTHEA</hi> had a Philosophers Spirit in a Womans
Bodie, and a knowing and disciplined Soul under a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Climat. There was nothing weak or rustical in
her Life: All her Actions were full of Courage and
Dexteritie. Chastity, Grace, and Modesty excepted,
nothing appeared in her agreeable to her Sex. Having
remained a Captive after the Defeat of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> vanquished by
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> she was set apart, as the most precious piece of the Spoil, and
as the choicest fruit of the Victory. And in this occasion her Vertue
appeared more rare and prizable then her Beauty. A noble man of
<hi>Persia</hi> having had the Impudence to attempt upon her Honour, Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Chastity, and Fidelity defended it: And the Victory which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
to her, evidently shewed that Fortune had not yet overcome
her. And that though she were an absolute Captive, yet she had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a free Heart and a soveraign Soul.</p>
                  <p>The Affection she bore to her Husband <hi>Abradates,</hi> was serious and
manly, she did not consume it in affected Discourses, and superfluous
Apprehensions. She truly loved his Life and Repose; but she was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of his Reputation and Renown: And she would rather have
wished him an untimely and glorious Death, then a dishonoured and
compleat old Age. So far was she from making him lose in her Closet the
hours of the Field, and from withdrawing him from Gallant Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and Honourable Dangers; that she sent him thither in a costly
Equipage like a Conquerer; that she delighted to see in him an adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and sumptuous Valour, which might both dazle and affright; which
might beget at once both Admiration and Fame.</p>
                  <p>He died likewise Victorious in the Gold Armour which she had
bought for him with her Pearl and pretious Stones: as if she intended
thereby either to adorn his Death, or to set a Value and Lustre on
his Victory. Being brought to her covered over with his own Blood,
and that of his Enemies, she received him Couragiously and with a
manly Constancy, mixt with sorrow and Majesty. She forbore not to
bewail him, but it was done with those modest and decent Tears which
do not soften the Heart, but beautifie the Face. Not being able to
make his Soul return into his Body, she essayed to substitute her own
in the place of it: For that end she opened her Bosom by a wide
wound: and leaning on him, as if she were willing to fill his Heart with
her Blood and Life; she dyed in two Bodies, and yeelded up her Soul
through her Husbands Wound and and her own.</p>

                  <p>I Put not here a Sword into Womens Hands, nor invite them unto
Poison, a Halter, or Precipice. Voluntary Death might appear
handsom and becoming in this <hi>Barbarian;</hi> it would seem black and
hideous in a Christian Woman. But Chastity, Fidelity and Constancie
are in use with all Nations, and requisite for All Sects. And our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Women without darkning or disfiguring themselves may imitate
Barbarian. Let them learn of her, that Conjugal Love is not an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
and mincing Passion; That it is vigorous and serious; That it is
capable of great Designes, and of Noble and Couragious Thoughts.
Let them understand, that though their Sex be exempted from the
Dangers and Functions of War, yet their Fortunes and Mindes are not
so: that they ought to serve with their Goods and Possessions, if not
with their Persons: And that it were a Disgrace for them to spare two or
three Pearls, and Parcels of rich Cutwork in Occasions, wherein Princes
are Liberal of their Blood, and Kings expose their Crowns and Heads.
In fine let them know that their chief Ornament consists in their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
Glory: that they ought to adorn themselves with all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to their Credit and Reputation: And that a man without
Honour is as great a Deformity to a brave Woman, as a Head of Clay to
a Statue of Ivorie.</p>

               <div type="question">
                  <head>MORAL QUESTION.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Concerning the Order which a Gallant Woman ought to
observe in Conjugal Love.</head>
                  <p>IF good Eyes and a great Light be requisite to love regularly, more
Courage and Vertue is yet required to it: And well ordained Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
what sweetness soever it promiseth, is the most powerful, and the
most rare perfection of a Gallant Woman. There are many who ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
love their Husbands: The Heart of a Turtle or the Soul of a Dove,
without other Philosophie would suffice for this Tendernesse. But
surely, few there are that love them according to measure and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their duties; few that know how to afford just proportions to
their kindnesses, and to set every office in its place, and in the degree
which is proper to it: Finally few that can boast with the Spouse in
the <hi>Canticles</hi> of having a regular Love, and a well ordered Charity.
And neverthelesse it is this regular Love, and well ordered Charitie
which must accomplish the Fortitude of a Woman; For according to
the saying of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> these give the Character and Tincture to all
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55122:53"/>
other Vertues of what Sex soever they be, and by what Names soever
they are called.</p>
                  <p>Morever this Order, to draw the Designe of it in little, and to teach
it by Epitomie, must be taken from the very order of those Objects
that are beloved. Wherein this proportion is to be exactly observed,
that every Object be ranked in the esteem, and according to the degree
of its Merit: That the most pretious and important should have the
first Cares and be furthest advanced in the Heart; that the rest of lesse
consequence should remain in the superficies, and rest satisfied with the
second thoughts and remaining Affections: And generally that love
should grow intense or remisse, rise or fall, act or acquiesce according
to the different weight, according to the several degrees, according to
the Value of the good which is to be affected and pursued.</p>
                  <p>This Rule ought to be in a Gallant Woman, what the Rod was to
the Angel whom <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw measuring the Temple. She ought not to
Love, but with proportion according to the quantity of merit: And
how vast soever her Heart is, she must yet be wary of pouring it out
rashly and at random, she ought to give nothing of it but by weight
and measure. Not that I permit her to divide, and distribute it to
whom she pleaseth, she owes it all entire to her Husband: But she
owes it not equally to her whole Husband. And as she owes more of it
to his Person, then to his Apparel and Livery; more to his Head, then
to his Hair, and more of it to his Hands, then to his Nails: so she
owes more to his Honour then to his Life; more to his Conscience
then to his Honour, more to his Soul and Salvation, then to his Bodie
and Fortune.</p>
                  <p>These measures and proportions are taken from Moral Philosophie,
which teacheth us, that such Loves as are loosned from us, and slide out
of us, are but small threads of that Love which remains in us. They
are taken from Christian Philosophie, which directs that Charity, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be terminated in our selves, or shed upon our Neighbour, should
be of the same Nature, both in its source, and where it makes its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge;
and that it should passe from one to another to the same end,
by the same tracks. Now there is no Woman so ill instructed, who
knows not, that by the Law of well ordered Charity, she owes her
essential and principal parts, and as I may say, the Heart of her
Heart, to his Honour and eternal Happiness: And owes only the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory
and superficial parts to his Life and Fortune. By this Law then,
as such Wives love themselves immoderately and inordinately, who give
to their Honour and Salvation but their second affections, and the
remaining cares after their lives secured, and their Fortunes setled. So
such do love their Husbands very confusedly, and without discretion,
who torment themselves both day and night about their Health, who
demand of Fortune Riches and noble Offices for them; and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to as little trouble concerning their Souls and Salvation, as if
the Bodie were the whole Person; and as if beyond the Tomb there
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55122:53"/>
were nothing but Fables to be expected and nothing but Fantomes to
be feared.</p>
                  <p>Certainly so inconsiderate a Love must needs have very bad Eyes:
And it cannot be, whatever men say, but a very childish and besotted
Love, to value things by the sound and colour, to forsake the solid
which is obscure, and noiseless; and to run after the superficial which
is bright and resounding. What would they say of a Woman who should
take the pains every morning to present flowers unto her Husband, and
who should at a great expence cause Essences and pretious Powders to
be brought from forreign parts to perfume his Clothes and Linen; who
should take upon her to feed his Servants and Horses; who should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolately
lament the fall of one Hair from his Head, and the prick of
a pin on his Hand. And after all these Tendernesses and Cares, could
without Emotion and with a quiet Spirit see him choak'd with an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie,
torn in pieces by his Dogs, and tyed upon a Wheel? What
might be spoken of this Woman, ought to be said of the most discreet
and prudent Women, I mean the discreet and prudent according to the
sence of the World. There are some of these wise and discreet Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who employ all sorts of Cares and Inventions about the Body and
Passions of a Husband. The touch of a Lancet which should but
scratch the skin would even pierce their Hearts, and cause their very
Souls to issue forth by their Eyes. A sleight Feaver which shall draw
but a few drops of sweat from him, will congeal the blood in their veins.
And as for his soul, which is the essential and important piece in order
to Eternity, they lesse deplore its falls and wounds, then they would
lament a torn Gorget, or a broken Dish of Purcelane. They will suffer
it without trouble to be tormented by as many Hangmen as there are
sins to be confiscated to the Divine Justice, and to its eternal Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
to become a prey to Hell and the second Death.</p>
                  <p>A Gallant Woman will not have such confused cares, nor such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable
kindnesses: All her Offices will be Just and Regular.
And if <hi>Panthea,</hi> who was but a Heathen, nay a Barbarous Heathen, had
a Heart Noble and Philosophical enough to with her Husband rather a
precipitated and Honourable Death, then an effeminate and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
old Age; our Christian Woman, who hath more light and a
better Guide will advance one step farther; and will rather wish for
the last perfection of her Love, that her Husband might ascend to
Heaven before his time; though he went thither without Feet or Hands,
as the Gospel saith, nay without either skin or Head, then to descend
into Hell all entire, and loaden with Scepters and Crowns. This Vertue
is not without example: some of them are seen in the Palaces of Kings,
where present interest crouds in, and findes so much relief; and where
the pretensions for the future are so little considerable and abandoned.
Those which I am going to present to your View are of this Nature:
they give not only instruction to Women, but will render Honour to
<hi>France,</hi> which hath educated Holy Queens and Martyred Princesses.</p>

be cast naked into a Pond, threatning to drown her unless she would
change her Religion. The couragious Princess was not daunted at the
Death she saw before her Eyes, and as it were upon the Brink of her
Lips. She was drawn out from thence with an initiated Martyrdom,
and a compleat Victory. And to overcome her self, as she had vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Gosuinda</hi> and Heresie, she suppressed the resentment of this injurie,
and concealed it even from <hi>Hermenigildus</hi> himself. But the Eyes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
are more spiritual, and see farther then others: they have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of prophetical in them: and the most artificial dissimulation
with all its Countenances, and Masks, could not make them believe it.
The Prince no sooner beheld her as yet pale with the Combat she had
lately sought, but he conceived an ill opinion of this Paleness: And
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55122:54"/>
not knowing whether he should take it for a signe of the past evil, or
for a presage of evil to come; he suffered in a Moment all that <hi>Indegun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi>
either had or could yet suffer. His Intreaties at last having wrested
the Truth out of her Mouth, he left the Court with her, and retired
to <hi>Sivil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was there where the Princesse freed from the Importunites and
wicked Devices of <hi>Gosuinda</hi> set upon Herisie in her turn: And gained a
second victory over her, which was evidently the Recompence of the
first. She was a Soveraign in her Husbands Heart: and though this
Soveraignty of Love placed her above all the Empires of the Earth;
yet she had a scruple to reign in that Heart, where the Son of God was
degraded. Having an Heretical Husband, she could not believe her self
to be entirely Catholick: And becoming one self same Flesh and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
with an excommnnicated Person, she apprehended to be burned
or stained with his <hi>Anathema:</hi> she feared left the sound part might
draw putrifaction and infection from the corrupted. But though she
were assured of her own salvation by an expresse Revelation from
Heaven; yet the eternal Reprobation of her Husband was a frightful
Specter, which awaked her every Night, and caused her to have strange
Dreams. At every moment she seemed to behold the Sword of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice severing two so well united halfs; And the exterminating
Angels seized upon the one and cast it into Flames.</p>
                  <p>On the other side she apprehended that the Conversion of <hi>Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigildus</hi>
might prove fatal to both their Lives, or at least that it might
infire the State. She had reason to fear the Furie of an irritated Step-mother,
and the Hands of an Heretical Father, become a Tyrant. It
seemed to her, that it would be more proper to suffer God to work;
To expect the effect of his Mercie with patience, and to enjoy, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while,
the Flower of her Youth, the Fruits of her marriage, and the
Offers of Fortune; then to lose all this by an indiscreet Pietie and of
Supererogation; and by an Enterprise exceeding her Forces. Faith
nevertheless weighed more with her Spirit, then human Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
and the Interest of Eternity prevailed against the Interest of
Time. She resolved, whatever might happen, no longer to endure
this Divorce of Religion, which profaned her Marriage: No longer
to suffer the Excommunication and <hi>Anathema</hi> of her Head, the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and Reprobation of her Husband.</p>
                  <p>Love was the first Doctor that began the Conference with <hi>Hermeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gildus:</hi>
The Graces, who are perswasive without speaking, joyned
themselves with Love, and were of the Party. There were neither
Texts cited, nor Reasons alleadged in this Dispute: All the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were Tears and Prayers: And Tears and Prayers effected more
then all the Divinity converted into Dilemmas and Syllogysms could
have done. <hi>Hermenigildus,</hi> shaken by this first Conference, shewed less
opposition at the second, which he had with the Bishop of S. <hi>Leander.</hi>
And the Light of Truth working more efficaciously, and with more
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55122:55"/>
Force upon a Subject, which the fire of Love had prepared, he submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at last to both. This change made a great noise: and he himself,
to give notice of it to all <hi>Spain,</hi> caused Mony to be coyned which was as
it were a publike Act of his Faith, and an abjuration of Heresie, which
his Image and Name published thorowout all the Cities.</p>
                  <p>After this, the Father irritated at the Conversion of his Son, and the
Son inflamed with his new received Faith, came to an open Breach.

seriously and with Tears represented to him the ill example and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of this War, and made him discern, that after a long contention
it could lead him but to a decryed and scandalous Victory, or to a
dismal Defeat followed by a Tragick Death. She made him call to
Minde the Heroick Maximes of that Faith he had embraced: And
often repeated to him, that according to this Faith Acts of Injustice
might less handsomly be committed, then suffered: and that there
was no Sufferes in so bad a Condition, who was not of more value

Mouths, which stirred the Coals on all sides. <hi>Hermenigildus</hi> who
foresaw that it would be great and lasting, resolved not to cast himself

                     <hi>Hermenigildus</hi>
promised to remember her good Instructions: He himself took the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55122:55"/>
Spirit and Zeal thereof from her Mouth. And all that he promised,
he kept exactly and with Constancy.</p>
                  <p>War having bin unfortunate to him, and the Imperial Forces which he
had called to his aid having betrayed him after a long Siege, he lost <hi>Sivil</hi>

and acquainted <hi>Leovigildus</hi> with the inclination he had to Peace
and Obedience. The old Man, who was not ignorant that despair is a
dangerous weapon, and that the last Efforts of the vanquished, and
the bitings of dying Beasts are equally to be feared, sent his Brother
<hi>Richardus</hi> to him, who ended the matter by perswasion, and brought
him in, without giving other Assurance then his Word. This confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
was Hazardous and full of Danger: And it is credible, that the
remembrance of <hi>Indegundis</hi> wrought more effectually therein, then the
perswasions of <hi>Ricaredus.</hi> The old man also having him in his power,
forgot his own Blood and Nature; and having in vain tryed him, like
a Tempter and a Tyrant, with Offers and Threats, Chains and Prisons,
not being able to deprive him of his Faith, he took off his Head</p>

wherein even in Despite of her, Nature was present with Grace.
She bewailed her dead Husband, and crowned him a Martyr; And she
could not crown him more richly then with her Tears. A few dayes
after God called <hi>Indegundis</hi> to give her a Crown. Affliction, Love, and
Zeal loosned her Soul: she died Victorious over Nature and Heresie:

The good Princesse armed with their Spirit, and fortified by the
remembrance of their Triumphs and Miracles, resisted his Wiles and
Violence. How little soever she had complyed and given way to the
Tempter, she might have reclaimed the Tyrant, and made him a good

crown her, then a Husband who might corrupt her.</p>

much she suffered from a Prince and People equally Barbarous and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OW vain are the Hopes of Man! And how
dangerous Imposters, and treacherous Guides
are Desires! <hi>Sinnorix</hi> came hither to give a
beginning to his Marriage: Death, which is
found every where, would be at the Feast in
Despite of the publick Joy. That which is
very strange, Love himself brought him thither: and by a
new and Fatall Revolution of all things, Vertue is there
a Cheat and a Homicide: And the betrothed serve as
Victimes to the Sacrifice prepared for the Ceremonie of their
Nuptials.</p>
               <p>Fidelity and Treacherie are the Subject of this Action;
<hi>Camma</hi> and <hi>Sinnorix</hi> are the Actors; and the Temple is the
Scene. <hi>Sinnorix</hi> not being able to overcome the Chastity of
<hi>Camma,</hi> at last caused her Husband <hi>Sinnarus</hi> to be slain, that he
might succeed to his Bed and Throne. And <hi>Camma</hi> knowing
no other way to be quit with <hi>Sinnorix,</hi> compassed it by the
feigned Consent she gave to his Addresses. She deserted not
her Revenge to time and occasions which might happen: she
would not expect obscure and Domestick ones: she believed
that she ought to satisfie her self in a high, and remarkable
way: And without giving one moment of Truce to her
Enemie, she comes to poison her self publickly with him,
by the drink which was prepared to confirm with Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55122:58"/>
and by a solemn sacrifice the Contract of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>The Declaration she made of so Couragious, and so little
expected an Action, raised a Tumult in the Temple, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
amongst the people. No person is seen there who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
on the Goddesse, or remembers the Sacrifice. The
Victimes which were already at the Foot of the Altar crowned
with Garlands of Flowers, and powdred over with fine Meal,
were affrighted at the Noise made about them: And saving
themselves with their Garlands and Ribbons threw down the
Perfumes and Censors; and scattered the Assistants surprized
with Astonishment, Superstition, and Fear. Instead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them back, the most confident accompany them in their
Flight. The Virgins of <hi>Diana</hi> only stayed behinde, and they
themselves were detained by a Terrour which tyed their feet
and congealed the Blood in their Veins. Their astonishment
and fear appeared on their faces, which bore the Color of their
Garments. The very flowers of their Crowns seemed to wax
pale by their Example, and Affrightment. The Torches
fallen from their Hands are extinguished by the Milk and
and Wine of the Goblets which were tumbled down: And
of these two confounded Liquors a third is composed, which
retains the Colour of them both.</p>
               <p>In this general tumult <hi>Camma</hi> alone remains quiet and
undaunted. She was never more fair and Graceful then you
now behold her: She never drank any thing more delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or pleasing to the taste, then that Remnant of Death
she newly gave her Enemie. The sweetnesse of the Revenge
she took, wrought upon her Heart before the poison, and
penetrated even to the bottom of her Soul. There was spread
from thence upon her face an effusion of Joy, accompanied
with a majestical and pleasing fiercenesse, even Anger it self
was there graceful: and the last drops of its Gall had there a
kinde of Sweetnesse. Nothing is seen in her of that Death
she had taken in: her Couutenance resembles a Conqueresse,
and in her Attire something appears festival and Triumphant.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55122:58"/>
The very Flowers where with she is Crowned seem to rejoyce
that they shall not be carried to a profane and polluted Bed:
And that they shall dye Ghast and without Blemish in her
Company. It was believed that she had taken them to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
with more decencie; and to render Honour to her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
and new Marriage: And this was done to go more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned
to <hi>Sinnatus,</hi> and to Triumph over <hi>Sinorix</hi> with more
Pomp.</p>
               <p>The wretched Man dejected by the Guilt of his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and pierced by the Reproaches of <hi>Camma,</hi> falls on the
Ground with the Fatal Cup which deceived him. The Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Death, which he drank, begins to spread it self on his
Face: And disquieted by his Despair, no lesse then by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
he looks upon <hi>Camma,</hi> with Eyes which speak neither a
Lover nor a Husband. I think also that he vents forth against
her all the Gall of his Spirit, which is more bitter, and comes
from a far worse spring then the poison he drank. And being
able to do her no more mischief, he dismembers her at least by
his desires and Gesture: And makes of her Bodie as many
pieces, as he sends forth Imprecations and Reproaches against
her. She hears him coldly and without Trouble. It may be
said that she loves him in this Condition: And having never
beheld him without Horrour, she now sees him with Joy.
Meanwhile the Poison gaining on her Noble Parts, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Heart half open, by the Effort which her Soul makes
there to sally forth, and reunite it self to <hi>Sinnatus;</hi> behold her
sinking between the Hands of her Maids.</p>
               <p>They are well recovered of their first disorder; but in no
Condition to help her, if their tears serve not for an Antidote.
The best they can do is to lift up their Eyes and hands to the
Goddesse, and to demand of her by their Gestures and Sighes
the preservation of so sublime a Vertue, for the Honor and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of their Sex. <hi>Do</hi> not believe that they are heard. <hi>Camma</hi>
opposeth their Petitions, and offers up Prayers to the contrary.
In the Smoak of the extinguished Torches, and the overturned
Censors she beholds the Ghost of <hi>Sinnatus</hi> still bleeding from his
VVound, who gives her a signe, that it is time to depart; And
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55122:59"/>
that she is expected in the Region of Chast and Faithful Souls.
Her impatience redoubles at this Object: And her Heart clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up she takes leave of the Goddesse; Craves Pardon for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in her Temple, and at the Foot of her Altar and Image, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
to Love and Revenge: And with these last words, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
up her Spirit with a serene Countenance; and such as a

and that a Crown is more for the Heart, then for the Arms or
for the Head. On the other side we learn from the Crime of <hi>Sinorix,</hi>
that unchast Love is a dangerous Guest: It enters with Nosegayes in its
Hand, and Garlands on his Head; And assoon as it comes into a House,
and hath there setled it self, it exhibits poisons and swords. We gather
also from his punnishment, that Divine Justice, though it sets forth late,
yet it fails not to arrive in due time: And that without causing Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners
to come afar off, it often makes our Idols become our Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors,
and our sins our punishments.</p>

                  <p>I Suppose the Truth of the Thesis, and suppose it upon the Report
of History, which is the Conserver of Truth, and the Depository
of fair Originals and eminent Examples. I have been consulting on
it in all Countreyes and Ages: and I confess that in every Countrey

Women by Troops, who dyed out of Fidelity and Love to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.
But when I required from it Husbands of the like Vertue and
Courage, scarce could it furnish me with enough to make a number.

those efficacious words by which she gave Reputation to her Death,
and Courage to that of <hi>Petus:</hi> The Lancet wherewith <hi>Paulina</hi> opened
her Veins, that she might die with <hi>Seneca:</hi> And divers other famous
pieces which are in Veneration with the Ancients; and which are seen
still coloured with Blood, and marked with the Fidelity of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
The sight of these pieces is sufficient alone, and without other
proof to perswade, that Women love more constantly, and with more
Fidelity then Men. But I suppose this Advantage of Womens Fidelity
above that of Men, who have hitherto lest no Reliques of it: And
seeking Reasons for it in Natural and Moral Philosophy, I finde eight,
which added to the Memorials of Antiquity, will strengthen this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
against the malitious Allegations wherewith some use to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
it: And which may make it at least an Article of Human Belief.</p>
                  <p>First, if Philosophy and Experience have Authority enough to be
credited therein, Affections follow Humours; and take their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and tincture from the temper which serves them for matter. Now
it is not doubted, but Melancholy is the predominant Humour in a
Woman: it is not doubted, but that her Temper is more moist and her
Complexion more tender then ours: we ought not then to doubt,
but that her Affections are more adhering and setled: and that she is
more strongly united to whatsoever she fastens her self. Why should
we doubt it, since Melancholy hath been hitherto believed to be the
matter of Constancie, and the most proper Oyle to nourish the fire of
Love? Since we see that loft things are better linked together then
hard ones: and that without Humidity no lasting union can be made.
From thence comes the ancient saying, which declares that the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Women can endure no Mediocrity: and that whatever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
they desire it obstinately, and without intermission.</p>
                  <p>Let us adde Instinct to Humour, and Necessity to Complexion: and
what Faith teacheth us, concerning the Creation of Woman taken out
of the side of Man, being supposed; Let us alledge for the second
Reason, that the Instinct of the part to the whole being of necessity,
and consequently stronger then the Instinct of the whole to the part,
which is but of congruity: It was according to the order of Nature
that a Woman should do by an Intelligent and Judicious inclination,
what all other separated parts perform out of a blinde and insensible
Propension. And since Man, from whom she was taken, is necessary for
her conservation; it appears nothing strange, that she adheres more
constantly to him, and renders him more affection then she receives:
And besides, this surplusage which she gives him, is lesse an advance and
a work of supererogation, then a duty and acknowledgment.</p>
                  <p>After this second Reason there follows a third, which is grounded
upon the Assistance and good Offices which Women receive from Men.
This assistance is frequent and more then ordinary, and these offices
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55122:61"/>
continual and at all hours. Those which the Bodie receives from the
Head can hardly suffer lesse interruption; those which the Moon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
from the Sun can scarce be more necessary to her. And therefore
if good offices be the tyes of Hearts, and the chains of Souls; is it not
reasonable that Women should love more then they are beloved; and
be more strongly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>astned then they fasten; since in the Domestick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
they servelesse then they are served; and are more obliged then
they oblige? Should they have lesse of good Nature then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
which fastens it self inseparably to the Tree that supports it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leaves it either in Life or Death? Should they love lesse constantly
then the Female Palm, which never findes comfort, never receives
verdure, nor is ever capable of Renovation after the Death of her
Male to which she was allyed.</p>
                  <p>This Fidelity doth not only appertain to the dutie and gratitude
of Women: but it concerns their Honour and Glory: And whether
in their opinion there be something of Nature and Instinct therein;
whether there be not something of Tradition or Hear-say; they are all
perswaded that Constancy, next to Chastity, is the predominant Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and the essential quality of Vertuous Women. Men place not
therein their puncti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>o of Honour: there is no Title less alledged
among them, there is no quality more cheap, then that of a good
Husband: They scarce rank or hold it considerable in the Description
of a Gallant Man. And from hence it comes, that Constancie and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
whereof I speak, being not controverted with Women, they
have ingrossed them both to themselves, and left to men in their room
Valour, Knowledge, Justice, and other Vertues, which as they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
suted better with the Dignity of their Sex.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it is the chief Ambition of good Women to be beloved
by their Husbands entirely and with perseverance. This begets their
Peace and Content at home: this procures them a good Name, and a
good odour of Reputation abroad On the other side they know, and
Nature hath taught it them, that the Heart is the only Bait with which
another Heart may be taken: and that Love, to which wings are given,
is a Bird not to be caught, but by another Love. From whence it ariseth,
that to possess this so important Love, they make advances of it which
exhaust them, and whereof very often there remains only in them a
habit of loving solitarily, and an obstinate and customary Fidelity.</p>
                  <p>Besides, it is with the Heart of a Woman, as with Rivers which are
kept in, and shut up; and have but a little Descent by which they have
liberty to disburthen themselves. Conscience and Honour, Chastitie
and Fear, the Laws of God, and the Laws of the World are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles
which encompass it on every side: and it cannot dilate it self
without breaking them, not break them without extraordinary vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
Likewise, when amidst so many obstacles, the discharge lies
open to it on the Husbands part, it pours it self forth on that side
with more impetiosity and restriction, then doth the Heart of a Man,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55122:61"/>
which resembles those shallow Rivers, which have neither Ridges not
Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>, but many little open streams through which they disburthen
themselves.</p>
                  <p>Let us also say, that Women being freed from many affairs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Men are charged; And Love being, as a certain Person said, the
businesse of persons wanting employment, and the occupation of those
that are at leasure: they must necessarily love with more Force, and
with more application of minde then they are beloved.</p>
                  <p>In sine, I adde for the eighth Reason, that Love hath Jealousies like
a King: It is also the Princely and Soveraign Passion: And in a Heart
where it reigns, it cannot endure that any should go equal with it, nor
play the Mistresse. Now the Hearts of Men are more divided, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to more Passions then those of Women. Every day occasions and
affairs introduce there some New Passion: and every one will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in its turn, and reign at least on the day of its Arrival. Perfect
Love, which is Jealous of its Authority, and an enemie to disorder
and confusion: not knowing how to be at quiet and in a state of
Honour amidst these turbulent Passions, gives way to them, and retires
into a Womans Heart: And it is there lesse disquieted and more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute:
No Rival is found there to rise up against it: There is no Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which doth not obey it. For this Reason, Fortune, Affairs, and the
Passions which are of their Train standing almost all for the Husband,
nothing remains for the Wise, but Conjugal Love accompanied with
Fidelity and Constancy. I might produce great number of Reasons
for it: but it is the weight and not the multitude which ought
to perswade. Let us conclude this Question with an Example, which
will manifest in despite of <hi>Monteigne,</hi> that there are modern as well as
ancient Fidelities: and that good Wives have appeared long after the
Age of either <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

strange nor new: the Rose and Thorn grow upon one stalk: and one fire
produceth both Light and Smoak. The representation thereof in that
respect will not be lesse delightful: And by an opposition like that

Earl of <hi>Castile</hi> in a publick and regular Duel, undertaken solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to be mistrusted when her fire is rakedup: when her teeth are
hidden: and when her Gall and Poison are covered with a seeming
sweetnesse. And we may take also in this sence the saying of holy
Scripture, which advices us to avoid the fury of an irritated Dove.</p>
                  <p>These Ashes of a plaistred Reconciliation, and this feigned meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a Dove, had like to have ruined <hi>Gonzales.</hi> He would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
himself from an open Fire: and would have defended himself
against an Eagle which should have assaulted him by Force. <hi>Theracis</hi>
counterfeits her self tractable and inclined to Peace; makes an offer of
Reconciliation: And to establish a solid and lasting Peace between <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
and <hi>Castile,</hi> she proposes a Marriage between her Sister <hi>Sanchis</hi>
and <hi>Gonzales.</hi> Surely the Bait was too tempting, and too subtilly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
and with too much dexterity to catch nothing. <hi>Gonzales</hi> who
was generous and no Enemie to Peace, gave ear to this Proposition;
receives from the Queen of <hi>Leen</hi> (deputed for the solemnization of the
Contract) the Promise of absent <hi>Sanchia,</hi> and returned her his. When
all things were agreed, he undertakes a journey to <hi>Navarre,</hi> with no
other Attendance then his own Family: Neither did he think to go to
a Siege or Battel: he beheved that his Voyage was to a Treaty of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:
and a Marriage is not treated of with Armies and Engins of
War: No man espouseth a beating Drum or flying Colours.</p>
                  <p>As soon as he arrived in <hi>Navarre,</hi> King <hi>Garcius</hi> a Complice in the
Treason of his Sister <hi>Theracia,</hi> received him with outrages and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches:
and without giving him time to recollect himself commits
him to Prison, and causeth him to be loaden with Chains more harsh
and ponderous, then those which he came to seek. <hi>Sanchia</hi> advertised of
so soul a Treason, to which she had contributed innocently, and with
no ill intent, thought her self obliged, for the Justification of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and for the Honour of her House, to assist a Prince who was
taken in her Name, and by her promise. She found out a means to see
him in Prison, and this sight mollified her Heart, and laid it open to
Passion, which never before found any accesse unto it. Pitty which is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55122:62"/>
not bashfull and suspected by no man, entred first boldly, and without
resistance: Love stole in fearfully after her, and was there received up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ingagements made by <hi>Gonzales,</hi> and upon the faith which had
been given him. <hi>Sanchia</hi> was already sufficiently tied by the promise
delegated to the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> her brother, and to her sister the
Queen of <hi>Leen:</hi> But she found her self there much faster tied by the
chains of <hi>Gonzales:</hi> She renewed to him the promise she had sent him
by the ministers of her brothers treachery: And having given necessary
orders for his liberty, she took him out of prison, and fled away with
him to <hi>Castile,</hi> where she was married to him in great pomp, and with
the general applause of the people.</p>
                  <p>I confesse that there was much of boldnesse in this action; and I would
not pardon it in a Maid, who had followed a wandring fire, and played
the part of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, or a <hi>Lucipps.</hi> But if we consider that <hi>Sanchia</hi> was
no longer at her own dispose, nor at her brothers: that she was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and betrothed to <hi>Gonzales:</hi> that she had given her faith out of
obedience: And that she owed more to her betrothed faith, then to
the treachery of her House; her boldnesse will be no reproach to her
memory: And men will rather give her an honourable ranke amongst
the <hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>sses,</hi> then joyn her with the wandring women of <hi>Romances.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
the King her brother did not take it in that sense. As soon
as he was advertised of his prisoners and sisters flight; he presently rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a powerfull Army and fell into <hi>Castile:</hi> But he fell in under so ill a
Planet, that he was defeated in the first Battell; and by the sport of
Fortune, which mingles at her pleasure, chains and Crowns, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
them sometimes upon one Head, and sometimes upon an other; or
to speak more Christianly, by a just disposure of Divine Providence,
which would punish Injustice and Treachery, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> in
his turne remained prisoner to his Fugitive, and was loaden with the
same Chains he had brought for him.</p>
                  <p>After some moneths of imprisonment, <hi>Gonzales</hi> moved by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
of his Wife, set him at liberty, and sent him back with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to his Kingdom: These benefits ought to be ranked amongst
those Coals, which according to the saying of the Wiseman, give new
heat to congealed Charity, and reenkindle extinguished affection:
But they stirred up hatred, and inkindled a new warre which would
have caused great flames and ruines, if the wise and couragious <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi>
before one drop of blood was spilt, had not mediated between
her Husband and Brother, and quenched with her tears the fire which
had taken on all sides. These tears which had vertue enough to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
a warre already flaming, and to pacifie two Kingdoms in Arms,
had not enough to sweeten the Animosity of a Woman. The Queen of
<hi>Leen</hi> reserved her passion in all the Treaties which were held: And in all
the Articles which were proposed to her, whatsoever her lips and tongue
did swear, and whatsoever her hand did signe, she full sware in her mind,
and signed in her heart the death of <hi>Gonzales.</hi>

The obstinate Princess not content with having laboured unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
and at a great expence to dishonour the Name of the King her
Brother, with having perverted her Faith and falsified her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
took away also the Honour and Reputation of the King her
Husband: And perswaded him to make of his Word and Faith a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
snare for <hi>Gonzales.</hi> The Faith of Kings is sacred; Their Promise
is holy, And it is a prophanation, and a kinde of Sacriledge to convert
them into Deceits and Treasons; and to make them serve for Baits to
Circumventions. This Prince nevertheless seduced by his Wife, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the Prophanation of his Word and Faith. He convened the
States of his Kingdom, and sent thither the Earl of <hi>Castile.</hi> The Earl
had sight good enough to discern afar off the snare which was laid for
him: but he had too good a Heart, and too confident a Soul to avoid
a snare from which he knew not well how to flie, but by flying from
his Duty, and turning his back to his Reputation. He stuck fast then to
his Reputation and Duty; and committed his Life and Liberty to
Fortune. Fortune nevertheless which is said to be favourable to bold
Actions, gave him no better entertainment at <hi>Leon,</hi> then he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at <hi>Navarre.</hi> He found there a second Prison, and as strong and
heavy chains as the former: And found no <hi>Sanchia</hi> in that place, who
might break these chains and open the Prison for him. But Love which
was more just then Fortune, and works far other Miracles, did not
long retard the bringing thither his Deliveress: And if she had been
Couragious and Faithful during the time of Contract, she shewed
her self yet more Couragious and Faithful in the state of Marriage.</p>
                  <p>Assoon as she had notice of her Husbands Captivity, her first thought
was to march in the head of twenty thousand men, to destroy his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with Fire and Sword, and to bring him back to <hi>Castile</hi> through the
Ruines, and Light of a flaming Province. To this first thought which
arose from her Courage, another succeeded, wherein there was more
of Prudence, and more of Safety for her Husband. She fixed upon
that, though the danger thereof was more evident for her self: And
she resolved to oppose to a foul and treacherous fraud, an innocent
and purely charitable deceit. She chose amongst the most Faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the Earl her Husband, all those who had most courage and
strength, and commanded them to follow her without noise, and with
Arms of more effect then shew. This done, she began her journey in
the habit and Marks of a Pilgrime: passeth every where for a Woman
of quality, who went to perform her Vow made to S. <hi>James.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
arrived in <hi>Leon</hi> with two Knights, she so craftily and dexterously
assaulted the Gates of the Prison, as at length they were opened to her,
and obtained leave to see her Husband.</p>
                  <p>The apparition of an Angel invironed with fire and covered over
with light, could scarce have more dazled <hi>Gonzales,</hi> then the arrival of
disguised <hi>Sanchia</hi> had done. After the first Embraces, and the Tears
that were mixt with them, which supplyed the place of Words, she
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55122:63"/>
acquainted him in few words with the occasion of her coming: And
conjured him to take the garment and liberty she had brought him, and
to leave her in exchange his Chains and Apparel; nay his punishment
and Death, if it were decreed he should die. This exchange being
made, he went out of Prison with the Garment and Heart of <hi>Sanchia;</hi>
And found the two Knights at the Gate, who brought him to the
place where his servants waited for him. The next day the light disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
that charitable Fraud which the night had concealed. The King
of <hi>Leon</hi> on the sudden expressed an Anger, which seemed never to be
allayed without effusion of Blood. But reason returning by degrees,
admiration succeeded his wrath: He highly praised a deceipt so well
meant, and of so great example. And having magnificently treated
his Sister, he sent her back to her husband with ceremonie and pomp:
and this Pomp served as a Triumph to Conjugal Love and the Fidelity
of Women.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is nothing here but exceeds
the measure of mean Spirits: Nothing
but transcends the Capacity of shallow
Heads. The Mausolaeum which you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
is one of the Worlds great Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
<hi>Artemisia</hi> who caused it to be built,
is another far greater Miracle, though not
so vast, nor wearieth so much the sight.
But both have wherewith to fill with her Renown, as well the
present as future Times: Wherewith to furnish matter for
new Fables; And to serve in History for a spectacle of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
and prodigie to all Nations and Ages.</p>
               <p>They are no common Architects which direct this sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and stately structure. Love is the undertaker and hath
traced out the designe: Magnificence presides in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and all the Arts gathered together work there under her
Command, and by her Orders. Surely it were needful to have
a very vast apprehension, and Eyes capable of great objects to
contemplate at once these pendant Quarries wrought into
Pillars: And to behold at one View a whole Mountain of
Jasper erected into an Obelisk. <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> must be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
exhausted and impoverished: I do beleeve that at present
there are left neither Marble in their Bosoms, nor pretious
Metals in their Veins. And you there behold in Frizes,
Chapters, and Ballisters, all that the sun was able to produce
rich and resplendent in many Ages. Not only all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Earth have been exhausted to serve for this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55122:65"/>
but whole Colonies of workmen have been consumed
therein; And all those rich carved Pieces, whereof your eyes
partake in an instant and without trouble, are the Invention
and labour of the ablest heads and the most skilfull hands of
<hi>Greece.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Leocarez</hi> who was the Authour and Father of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Gods, and of the most eminent Artists of these dayes,
imployed all his skill in that Statue which he made of one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Agate. It hath no other colours then what the Stone
brought with it from the Quarry. And neverthelesse by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence,
which exceeded the expectation of the VVorkman,
Nature so well mingled them, and with so much equality and
proportion, that a Picture, were it drawn by the hand of <hi>Apelles</hi>
himself, could not better resemble <hi>Mausolus.</hi> Three Lamps
framed of three large Rubies make a precious Fire, fed with
Balm under this Figure. There is a fourth, which is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of a more noble matter, which sends forth a cleerer and
more resplendent flame, though it be invisible. It is the heart it
self of <hi>Artemisia,</hi> which burns alwayes equally and with the
same fire, and consumes before her Husbands Ghost still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to her eyes.</p>
               <p>I observe that you have a long time fixed your sight parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
upon the face of this Colossus, and upon the strange
Characters it bears. The Characters are <hi>Egyptian</hi> and Sacred.
The Subject is the Elogy of <hi>Mausolus,</hi> expressed in figured
and mysticall termes. The mourning of his Widow, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
of his People are not there forgotten: But all this, as you
may see, is there onely in Epitome, and in a cold and livelesse
stile. The most Magnificent, even the most eloquent and
faithfull Epitaph of <hi>Mausolus</hi> is in the heart of <hi>Artemisia.</hi> Love
and Death have grav'd it with their Pencils. There is not a
word in it which hath not both life and heat, which doth not
love and sigh, which doth not resent and is not resented. Is it
not that which the Architect meant to expresse by this Love
and Death, which he hath couched at the Foot of the Obelisk?
Would you not say that these Characters were but newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven,
and that they made all Passengers who shall read them
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55122:65"/>
to accompany with their sighs and Tears, the Sighs of the Arts,
and the Tears of the Muses; the sadnesse of the Metals, and
the mourning of the Marbles?</p>
               <p>As for those two other Loves which close up the Ballisters,
they are numbred among those which have contributed their
Cares and Labours to this vast Work. They hold also the
Square and Compass in their Hands: And seem thereby wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give Testimonie against the Errours of the ignorant,
who perswade themselves that Love can act nothing which is
not tumultuous and irregular; And that there is nothing but
confusion and disorder in all its productions. Love neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
(whatsoever these ignorant persons may say of it) is the
superintent of Harmonies and Accords; and the first inventer
of Squares and Measures: And I do not doubt, but if some
one of those people came hither, he would presently avow
that Love is more regular and better proportioned in this vast
building, then Philosophie ever was in the Tub of the Cynick.
Surely also it is wonderful to behold, such regular Enormities,
and such adjusted proportions amidst so great excesse. But
nothing yet there appears save the first draughts of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
and evennesse: And one must expect the last form of
the whole Bodie to judge of the correspondencie between these
enormous and monstruous parts, which are the Temerities of
Art, the Exaggerations of Marble and Jasper; And if I may
say so, the Hyperboles and Amplifications of Architecture.</p>
               <p>We are not the only persons in whom so sumptuous and
magnificent a mourning begets astonishment. Those that you
see at the Foot of the steps, though they belong to the Court
of <hi>Artemisia,</hi> and are accustomed to the Majestie of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
and have their Mindes and Eyes as full of it as ours.
Some expresse their astonishment by their Gesture, and seem
to say that this Monument will one day draw all <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Asia,</hi>
and be an Heroick Temple, where Magnificence and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Love and Death, <hi>Artemisia</hi> and <hi>Mausolus</hi> will be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
together, and receive from Posterity an equal worship,
and like Oblations. The rest further advanced observe her
action, and accompany it with their respect and silence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:55122:66"/>
The affliction of her Minde seems to have passed even into
her Garment, which is black and without ornament. Her sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
nevertheless is Majestical and becoming: And upon
her face, still pale by the Death of her Husband, there appears
a kinde of pleasing languishment, which demands compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and would beget Love, if it were in a subject either lesse
elevated, or lesse austere. Two Turtle Doves which she her
self newly sacrificed to the Spirit of <hi>Mausolus</hi> burn before her,
with her Hair upon an Altar of Porphirie: And mean while
the fire which seized on her Heart by degrees consumes the
tyes of her Soul, and prepares it to go joyn it self with the
other Heart which expects it. The ashes of <hi>Mausolus,</hi> which she
hitherto so charily preserved, are moistned with her Tears in
the Cup you see in her hand. She takes it up to drink them: And
her moist and sparkling Eyes which partake something of the
Sun and Rain seem to say to those that understand them, that
she nevertook any thing more sweet and pleasing to her tast:
That the richest works of Art and Nature could not worthily
enough conserve so pretious a Pledge: That these dear Ashes
are due unto the fire of her Heart, and that nothing but <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misia</hi>
alone could make a fit sepulchre for <hi>Mausolus.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is nothing strange that <hi>Artemisia</hi> speaks in this Picture:
She hath lived above three thousand yeers in the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of Man. Her Fortune and Dignity nevertheless hath
not preserved it for her. Whatsoever hath been said of
Gold, it doth not exempt those from corruption who
wear it in their Crowns: and the Names of Kings and
Queens ought not to be more priviledged then their Persons, which
die upon Thrones. Vertue hath made <hi>Artemisia</hi> live to this day,
and would have her remain to her Sex, an everlasting Example of a
peaceable Magnanimity; and of a Widowhood Couragious without
Despair, and afflicted without Dejection. The one Moity of her dyed
with <hi>Mausolus,</hi> and she burned with him that part of her Heart in which
Joy resided: But she reserved the other in which was Fortitude and
Courage. And if since the fatal Moment which had thus divided her,
she was never seen to delight in any thing, yet no man ever observed the
the least weaknesse in her. Her modest and strict mourning, and her
well becoming and Majestical reservednesse suted with a perfect Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow:
But her bold and Couragious activity in War her dexterous
and free Conduct in managing affairs; and her constancie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
all sorts of second affections, was like a Woman, who acted still
with the Heart and Spirit of her Husband, and who had even espoused
his shadow. But not being content to have preserved his Courage in
her action, and his image in her Memory, she must needs have also his
Ashes upon her Heart; And erected his Name and Tomb into a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
by a structure in which all the Arts wearied themselves, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
her self was almost exhausted.</p>

                     <hi>ARTEMISIA</hi> though a Heathen and a Barbarian is to young
Widows a Governesse full of Authority and of great Example.
She teacheth them that the most invincible and strongest Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
is not that which sends forth the loudest cryes, and which seeks
to express it self by Poisons and Precipices: That it is Modesty and
Fidelity which make chast Matrons, and not Hairs pulld up by the
root, and torn Cheeks, That a sober and lasting Mourning is more
decent and exemplar, then an unequal affliction which tears it self
to day and paints it self to morrow, which is furious on the day
of a Husbands Buriall; and will endure no Discourse but of
Poison and Ropes, and two Dayes after will have their Haire
curled, their faces painted and spotted. And that a Heathen woman
having in one Monument placed all the wealth of a whole Kingdom,
to raise unto the Name of her Husband an imaginary and fantasticall
Eternity. It is a very great shame that Christian women should not
distribute even for the salvation of their Husbands, and the Comfort of
their own Souls the Remainder of what they spend upon Play, Vanity,
and Excess. And because this Truth is important and of great use, I
conceived, that it would be very beneficial to give it a more solid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and to make a Discourse of it apart, where it shall have all
the proofs and all the light whereof it is capable.</p>

               <div type="question">
                  <head>MORAL QUESTION.</head>
                  <head type="sub">In what manner a Gallant Woman should mourn, and what
ought to be the duties of her Widowhood.</head>
                  <p>THose Women are very ill instructed in the Morality of their Sex,
who reduce into Shagrin and sadnesse all the Duties and Vertues
of a prudent Widow. A serious and constant Love doth not
wholly pour it self forth into tears; And all the decency of exemplar
Fidelity consists not in a black cypress Veil or Gown: It is not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by shadowed lights, and weeping Tapers; And it is not discovered
by studied looks, and by fourty hours of artificiall darkness. Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
I say even Christian philosophy, forbids not tears in like occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
It is impossible that blood should not flow from hearts which are
divided, and from souls which are severed by force. And since man, as
the Scripture tells us, is the head of the woman, the wonder would be
no lesse, if a Wise should lose her Husband without weeping, then if
a body should not bleed when the head is cut off: But she ought not
also to perswade her self that her wound must run everlastingly; And
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55122:67"/>
that it concerns her honour to have alwayes tears in her eyes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
in her mouth. Sadness, Mourning, Solitude, relate indeed to
her duty, but make not the most important, and indispensable part
thereof: And yet by a publique Errour, which time and custome have
authorized, this lesse important part is superstitiously observed. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are not content with a regular and discreet sadness, they put on
an extravagant and fantasticall kind of sorrow; And Opinion begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
where Nature ends, they sigh for fashions sake, and weep artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
after the true mourning hath consumed the reall sighes, and when
tears in good earnest are exhausted.</p>
                  <p>A Prudent and Couragious Widow will give no way to fancy, or
opinion, and will submit all that she can reasonably and with decency,
to lawfull Customes, and to instructed and cultivated Nature. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once satisfied these duties of tendernesse which proceed more from
the superficies then the bottome of the heart, she will reserve her self
for more solid and serious duties of greater force and use, wherein her
affection and fidelity may act more profitably, and be produced with
more honour and reputation. The weak widows who raise up a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
and slothfull sadness to a degree of Vertue; and the wilfull who glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in an incurable grief, will oppose to these duties the example of the
widow Palme, I mean of that Palme from which the Male is taken
away: She is never cured, as they say, of her driness, which is her affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and what care soever is taken to reestablish her, she dies at length
languishing, and of I know not what secret disease, which resembles our
Melancholy.</p>
                  <p>However it fares with the widowhood of the Palme, which is but a
Metaphoricall and figurative widowhood, as her love is but symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and allegoricall: If it be lawfull to make comparisons, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
figure for figure, I will say that a prudent widow ought to leave
unto weak souls examples of weakness, which resides in the lowest story
of souls; and to seek out in the Region of light and pure spirits, patterns
of a generous mourning, and of an active and well governed affliction:
She will performe during a widowhood of many yeers, what the Moon
doth during a widowhood of few hours: An obscurity is seen upon
the face of the Eclipsed Moon; And this obscurity is, to speak proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but the sadness and mourning of her widowhood, occasioned by the
interposition of the Earth between her and the Sunne. But this sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which deprives her of colour, takes not away her force. It makes
her not descend from her Elevation, nor diverts her course: Though
she appears black to us, yet she forbears not to keep her Station, and to
move regularly and in order: And her mourning doth not hinder her
from following the conduct of her Intelligence. The affliction of the
sage Widow ought to be just and regular, like that of the Moon. Her
mourning ought not to deject her heart, nor discompose her carriage.
It ought not to obscure the light of her soul, nor retard the activity she
owes either her House, or the Republique, to which she is after the death
of her Husband, what the Moon is to the World in the absence of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55122:68"/>
Sunne. Her affliction is not exempted from these duties, and her Sex
gives her no dispensation for them. The Widow and afflicted Turtle
doth not abandon the care of her neast, and the feeding of her little
ones. And the Mother Eagle when the Male is taken from her doth
not forbear to prey and make warre upon Serpents. There are exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
enough of this Active and Couragious Widowhood, of this reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and well ordered sorrow, of this discreet and magnanimous mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
This which I am going about to propose, is Illustrious and full
of Reputation: and the sight of it ought to be so much the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull,
in respect a Copy of it is now drawn, which posterity will
esteem no lesse then its Originall.</p>

was the third Widow, who honoured this Age, so fruitful in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Examples, and Crowned Vertues. Her Charity and Works of
Mercie retain still a good odour in the Church, and edifie the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
It is reported that the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> the second, who was
present at the opening of her Tomb, made an offering to her of three
Crowns of Gold: And by this Ceremonie crowned in one single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
a holy Virgin, a holy Wife, and a holy Widow. The Charity of
Queen <hi>Blanch</hi> was practised in a higher degree then that of <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
Her works of Mercie were more universal, more necessary, of greater
use and better Example. The poor were not only entertained and the
sick comforted by her good deeds; but Nations were conserved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and Provinces setled in Peace, Wars extinguished, Troubles paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
good Lawes established, publick abuses reformed, Heresies either
humbled or abolished, and a whole kingdom preserved in peace, and
quietly governed, and with Justice. These Royal Charities and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of State, are of a quite other Rank then the particular ones which
are practised in Hospitals. And the Crown of a Holy Queen which
<hi>Blanch</hi> hath merited thereby, may equal those of a holy Wife, of a
holy Widow, and of a holy Nun, which the purchased by her other
Vertues.</p>
                  <p>But I look upon her here as a Widow: and without doing injury to
the memory of three others, who were not set forth with so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and who left lesse light behinde them; We may well place
her upon the Stage, and propose her for the pattern of a modest and
constant, active and victorious Widow. Her heart by the Death of the
King her Husband suffered all that a Heart violently t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and divided between Grief and Love, could endure. But Reason and
Piety prevailed over Grief and Love; and so well ioyned the pieces of
this Heart, that a scarre onely remained without weaknesse or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie.</p>
                  <p>After this secret and domestick Combat sought against two predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55122:69"/>
passions, and authorized by Nature; she began by the Cares
and Duties of a Mother, which was to her more intimate, and of a
longer standing then a Regent: and applyed her first thoughts to the
education of her Son. Having a designe to make him a Holy, Wise, and
Victorious King, she placed about him able Religious men, and of good
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, who seasoned in him the first principles of Piety; Men of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and experience who read him lessons of State-affairs, and taught
him Policie sutable to the time and practise; Captains and Knights of
Reputation, who instructed him in the Science of War, and rendred
him one of the most Gallant men at Arms in the whole Kingdom.
Passing from thence to the Functions of her Regencie, she began with
setling Religion, which ought to be the principle Pillar of a State.
And because she was not ignorant that the least Divisions in this Pillar
might procure the general destruction of the whole building; and
that Conspiracies and Revolts are the ordinary Attendants of Schisms
and Heresies, she vigorously endeavoured the reduction of the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses.</hi>
Her pains therein found so happy success, as she dissipated the
Remnants of this unhappy Sect: And <hi>Raymond</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholouse</hi> forced
by her Arms, submitted to the Authority of the Church; expiated the
Apostacie of his House, and the Rebellion of his Progenitors, made
publick satisfaction, and in his shirt, to that Religion which he had so
often violated.</p>
                  <p>These happy successes of a most happy Regency did not hinder the
Commotions of some disgusted Princes from shaking the vessel, and
indangering it in the midst of a Calm. They did not hate the Princess
who governed, she was too amiable, and ruled with too much Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and <hi>Grace:</hi> But it vexed them to see the Stern in her hands;
and they were willing to take it from her, with a purpose to break it,
and to divide it amongst themselves. Noise and Tumult did not astonish
the Regent not put her in disorder: she dexterously managed the most
tractable, and brought them back by little and little to their duty, she
shewed her Sword lifted up to the most perverse and untractable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
And by her Prudence, no lesse then by her Courage, their raised
Troops, and plotted Enterprises were reduced to Deputies, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
Force having proved so unsuccessful to them, they resolved to
practise Treason, and undertook to carry away the King as he was
going to the appointed Assembly at <hi>Vandome.</hi> But it is a dangerous thing
to undertake to steal away a young Eagle from under the Wings of his
Mother, and to carry away by force a young Whelp from a Lionesse.
<hi>Blanch</hi> being advertised of their Conspiracie saved the King in the
Castle of <hi>Mount-le-Hery:</hi> and from thence brought him back to <hi>Paris</hi>
with a strong Convoy, and even the sight of the Conspirators, to whom
there remained only shame and despite, which are the first punishments
of discovered Treasons.</p>
                  <p>After these appeased Troubles the Duke of <hi>Brittany</hi> on the one side,
and the Earl of <hi>Champain</hi> on the other, raised with new Charges a new
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55122:69"/>
party. <hi>Blanch</hi> went out the first in the most rigid season of the Year.
The heat of her Courage was so great in this War, and her March so
speedy and vigorous, that not being to be stayed either by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
which stopped the most rapid Rivers, nor by the Heavens which poured
down Snow, she returned in few Moneths victorious over Winter, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Rebellion. The Earl of <hi>Champain</hi> was defeated with less Noise,
and with gentler Arms. The King being already set forth to chastise
him, the Regent got before him, and went to try whether perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
might prevail without Force. But he yielded neither to perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
nor Force. They were the Graces which vanquished him; The
face of <hi>Blanch</hi> left nothing to be acted by Reason or Arms, It gained
the Victory without Combat; It concluded the Treaty without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
or Articles. And the Earl who was come forth a Rebel to
the Son, returned back a Slave to the Mother, and a sworn Servant to
them both.</p>
                  <p>All the whole Regency of <hi>Blanch</hi> was thus powerful. And in the
Field as well as in the Closet, in Military no lesse then Civil Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes,
she shewed that her Heart and Head were equally capable of
the two parts of Regality: That her Hands were as fit for the Scepter
as for the Sword; and that she knew how to govern as efficaciously, as
handsomly to overcome. This so lively and beneficial light did not
escape the being assaulted with very soul slanders, which fell upon that
which ought to be most respected and inviolable in a Woman. But the
vapours which arise from the Earth do not darken the Sun, nor hinder
it from doing good to the World; and these Obloquies took not away
one single Ray from the Vertue of <hi>Blanch,</hi> nor hindred her from shining
and finishing her Course peaceably and with Honour. In fine, to equal
also in austerity and submission, such as she had excelled by action and
in the Government of affairs, she imbraced like them the profession of
a regular life. Thereby the acquired out of the World the Regality of
the poor and humble, the Soveraignty of Spirit and interiour Unction.
She finished what was wanting to a Queen by adding to that Dignity
the Title of Religious. And the Veil which she took was to her a second
Crown, which gave a second Lustre and set a new value upon the first.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have heard of the Rout of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi>
and of the last part his
treacherous Fortune plaid him. This
extravagant, after many phantastical
prancks, and dayly disorders at last
entertained new Loves, leaving him,
to bequeath her self to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
She carryed away ather going off, all
the favours she had given him: she
resumed all her Crowns and Scepters: And of so many Marks
of Love, of so many stately Pledges, and glorious Ensignes,
she left him onely an impoisoned Ring, to the end his Despair
might possesse at least something that was rich; and that a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
might procure him a more honourable and glorious
Death, then a halter could do.</p>
               <p>This pernicious Example spread it self thorowout all <hi>Asia;</hi>
and the Infidelity of Fortune was followed with the Revolt
of the People. But that which will move Pittie even in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
<hi>Asia,</hi> and would do the like in Fortune if she had any
sensible part; that which will be lamented by deserting and
Rebellious People, is that <hi>Mithridates</hi> as jealous of his Wife,
as despairing of his Affairs, resolved to depart out of the
World, to remain no longer in the power of Fortune; and
to take a Course that his Wife might first go out of it, not to
leave her behinde in the Hands of his Enemies. This Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Resolution accompanied with a far more Barbarous
Command hapned to be brought to the Queen, by an Eunuch
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55122:71"/>
of her Chamber. The Message was delivered solemly and
with Ceremonie, with mournful looks, and a Pomp which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
some great Funeral. <hi>Monima</hi> on the contrary received
it with her Festival Countenance, and a Face full of Joy.
She likewise adorned her self, and put on all her Jewels to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it with the greatest shew and Lustre. As if she had taken
this Message for a Defiance of Fortune and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> she
resolved to brave them both, and inform the World, that she
had rather be with Death, then alive with Jealous <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
or deceitful Fortune.</p>
               <p>Being informed that her Husband carried in an easie and
woundlesse Death an impoisoned Ring; she believed that her
Diadem might well be as compassionate to her, and render
her the like office. And that after the having deprived her of
Liberty it might deprive her also of Life. But the Diadem as
you see is broken in her hands: You will peradventure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Majestie opposeth it self thereunto, and that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
his Honour not to suffer an Ensigne of Dignity, and a
Sacred, and Regal Ornament to become an Instrument of
Despair, and a Fatal Core. You will perchance believe that
the Graces are come to the Aid of an Innocent and ill treated
Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have hindred the Pearls which are particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to them from being prophaned by her Death, who is
the Glory of their Sex, and the Pearl of <hi>Asia.</hi> Others will
believe, and peradvanture with more probability, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem
had much of the malice and Spirit of Fortune which
wrought it; And that it being made to deprive <hi>Monima</hi> of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
it ought rather to break then to bestow it on her. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it were, the Wise and Couragious Queen looks upon the
pieces of it with a Countenance where there is lesse of Despair
then Contempt, and more of a Philosopher then a Woman.
This haughty and becoming Action, mixed with fiercenesse
and modesty, hath something I know not what which explains
it self more efficaciously then Clamours and Reproaches:
And a furious Woman, who should exclaim with open mouth
against Fortune, could not do her more Despite, nor so highly
reproach her Impotencie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:55122:71"/>
Surely also the Woman that you see is not a painted Idol,
a dainty and voluptuous <hi>Barbarian,</hi> and <hi>Asian</hi> fit onely for
the Bed and Table. She is a Couragious and knowing
Beauty, a severe and Stoical Beauty; A Beauty which lead
Philosophie into a <hi>Seraglio;</hi> which reformed the Riot and
Delights of a debauched Court, which preserved amongst
the Women and Eunuchs of <hi>Asia,</hi> the Constancie and
Austeritie of the Sages of <hi>Greece:</hi> Notwithstanding all
this, she is commanded to die: In vain do the Vertues and
Graces intercede for her; In vain do they appeal from
her Husbands barbarous Will; They will not procure it to
be cancelled whatsoever they alledg to the contrary: And you
see already the poor Queen laid on her Bed, and ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the stroke which was to execute it.</p>
               <p>But consider here on the one side the trouble of a brutish
and discomposed Soul: And on the other side the calme and
serenity of a wise and well instructed Spirit. The Eunuch is
affrighted with the cruel Obedience which he is going to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto his Master. Of his two hands the guilty one which
was to give this unhappy Blow, proves weak and feeble, scarce
able to bear up the Sword. The other, more innocent is lifted
up as if it stood upon its Guard either against some Fantome
which threatned it, or against the Lightning which issues
forth of <hi>Monima's</hi> Eyes, and which fills the Chamber with
a sudden and new Light. It would be hard to judge whether
it be out of Fear or Respect, that he turns away his Head;
whether he be affrighted with the Jealousie of his Master,
or dazled with the Majestie of his Mistresse; whether he
apprehends the being unfaithfull to the one, or impious
and Sacrilegious to the other. <hi>Monima</hi> nevertheless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
him, and presents to him her naked Throat. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Serenitie of her Countenance, and the sweetnesse
of her Eyes, you would take her for a Captive, who flatters
her Deliverer, and intreats him speedily to break her Chains.
Hence it appears who would be most terrified with the
Prick of a Thorn, and who would be lesse bold in gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Rose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:55122:72"/>
You are astonished to see so much resolution joyned with
so many Graces, and so much Constancie in a Countrey of
Riot, and in an <hi>Asian</hi> Court. Surely also the Graces are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
accompanied with Resolution. Constancie is not the
Companion of Riot: And the Vertue of <hi>Monima</hi> is not
borne upon this Stately and Sumptuous Bed where you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
her. The Jewels which load as much as they adorn her,
neither setled her Minde, nor fortified her Courage. Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie
hath educated and trained her up with her own Hands;
and good Books have formed her. They have been her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structors
in her Fathers House: They are her Councellors
and Confidents at Court: She hath given them all the
Hours which others bestowe on their Looking Glasses and
Flatterers: She hath drawn from them that Constancie and
Vigour of Spirit, which you behold in her; And even at
present she caused them to assemble upon this Table, to be
supported by them in this Combat; and to overcome
Fortune and Death by their Assistance and in their Sight.</p>
               <p>But what Disposition soever she had to die Couragiously
and like a Conqueresse; her Despairing VVomen cry out
against her Courage, and oppose her Victory. The boldest
amongst them put back the Eunuch with her Hand and
Voice: She gives him injurious Language, and yet tenders
supplications to him. Anger and Pittie speak both at one by
her Mouth; and you would say, that either willingly or by
force she will obtain from him the Death he prepares for her
Mistresse. The rest melt into Tears, and tear their Hair;
as if of their torne Hair Ropes were to be made to tye the
Hands of Death: And as if by their Tears shed in streams
they were able to Ransome their Mistresse; They would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Redeem her with their Blood, if Death would be paid
with the Exchange: And if they could either deceive or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Jealousie of <hi>Mithridates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They alone were not afflicted at the deplorable end of their
Fair and Wise Mistresse. The Vertues and Graces which
alwayes attended her, are yet more afflicted at it then they.
VVe might behold from hence these Fair afflicted Women,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55122:72"/>
and become Spectators of the Modestie of their Sadnesse, and
the Comlinesse of their Tears, if our Eyes were purer, and
more accustomed to Spiritual Visions. Fortune her self, who
hath composed all this Tragick Scene, cannot look upon her
without some kinde of Regret; and I do not doubt but
she would make another Catastrophe, and conclude it by a
more happy issue, if she could make a Reconciliation with
Vertue, and be cured of the Jealousie which he hath of her.</p>

thousand thorns, and perchance to as many blemishes in the Palace of
<hi>Mithridates.</hi> This Palace was to her a gallant Prison, and her Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
a specious Yoak. She was inchain'd with her own Diadem,
and tormented upon her Throne: And the matter of her glory was the
matter of her servitude, and the instrument of her punishment Her
bloud retains still a voice and spirit in this Picture; And if you hearken
to her Ghost, it will tell you, that your Liberty though obscure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious,
is of more value then the lustre and riches of her Chain;
that it would be better for you to be your own Mistress in a Cottage,
then to be a slave under a Cloth of State: And that a Turtle is more
happy in the Desert, then an Eagle in a guilded Cage.</p>
                  <p>Learn then from the unfortunate Dignity of <hi>Monima,</hi> that the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of Women consists not in those remarkable Pieces, and specious
Colours, whereof Fortune composeth great Ladies. It is made up of
the tranquillity of the Minde; Of the satisfaction of the Heart, and the
repose of Conscience: And the priviledge of sitting in presence of a
Queen, contributes nothing to the tranquillity of the Minde, Nor pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the soul in a better seat. Crowned Coats of Arms, and the Title
of a Palace written in golden Letters upon the gate of a House, are not
Defences against Adversity, Discords, and the exterminating Angels
Canopies of State, and Balisters are not respected by spight and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
nor by unquiet Nights, and perplexing Dreams. There is nothing
that prohibits evil passions, and detractions, to follow Coaches which
have right to enter the Louvre: And commonly the thornes of the
Heart spring from the Jewels on the Head; The wounds and ulcers of
the Conscience proceed from the trickings and ornaments of the face.
In fine, if the Vertues and Graces be for you, do not envie others their
good Fortune: And remember, that flowers are more fair and continue
longer fresh in Valleys then on Mountains. There is another Conside<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration
to be had upon this History, and because it is curious and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The ensuing Question will teach us the speculation and use
thereof.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="question">
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:55122:74"/>
                  <head>MORAL QUESTION.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Whether it appertains to the dutie of a gallant Woman to
expose her Life to satisfie the minde of a
Jealous Husband.</head>
                  <p>IT would be very Inhumane to go about to lay more weight upon the
yoak of married Women. It lieth heavy enough already upon
their necks and hearts: And if the most Couragious amongst them
had not their comforts, they would scarce be able to bear it one hour.
It is enough that they have been condemned to obedience and subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
without being still subject to Jealousie: And that an imaginary
and barbarous duty, which nature avows not, and which is neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the universall, nor written Law, should oblige them to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
themselves, as often as it shall please this fantasticall fury.
Truly not to speak of other burthens; The condition of Mothers
would be harder and more deplorable then was heretofore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Children, who were immolated to fiery and sanguinary Idols.
And if they owe their bloud and life to the cure of their jealous Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
there is scarce any so happily married, or so discreet, that three
or four times a week, ought not to prepare her self, either for a knife,
rope, poison, or precipice.</p>
                  <p>Extream and expensive Remedies are not for daily Maladies; and
there is no Malady so popular and common to weak Spirits as Jealousie:
nor is there any infirmity which doth so easily, and at random seiz up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unsetled brains. There needs but a piece of Ribbon, or a Nosegay,
but a word, which signifieth Nothing, but a sigh vented by chance to
make a man jealous: And being once so made, he hath visions and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sits, which exceed the whimsies of frantick people. His minde
and thoughts will quarrell with all the Figures in a piece of Tapistry,
and will take them for Rivals, that debauch the eyes of his Wife, and
court her in silence. If she presents her self before her looking-glasse,
he will accuse her very Image of bringing her some message of assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And in case she commend but an ancient marble Statue, or look
but fixedly on a Picture, it will hinder his sleep. He will even mistrust
the prayer Books he shall see in her hands; And when she shall say her
Hours, he will beleeve that she reads Love-letters: There will be no
Domestique upon whom he will not ground some suspition: And
the most faithfull, will in his conceit, be taken either for disguised
Gallants, or confidents maintained at his expence.</p>
                  <p>Would it be just to oblige Women to the Warranty of all these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies?
And would it not be extreamly cruell, to demand their
bloud, to make a Remedy for so fantasticall a Disease? There is then
no written Law, nor any Tradition which ordains them to die for their
jealous Husbands: But excepting life and conscience, they can have
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55122:74"/>
nothing so intimate to their Souls, nothing so fixed to their Hearts,
which they ought not to tear from both; be it to prevent Jealousie
which might grow, or to cure that which may be already grown.</p>
                  <p>This they owe first to their Conscience; and to the Evangelical
Precept, which ordains them to cut off their Hands and Feet, if they
be feet of Offence, and hands of Scandal. I say not that they should
cut them off with Saw or Rasor: but by an unbloody and moral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
whereby, without tearing one single Nail, without taking
from them one Hair, they deprive them of all the functions, which
may occasion a fall. It imports not that these functions be innocent of
their own Nature; and that besides there be no evil intervening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to spoil them. Persumes are excellent things; yet Women to
whom Persumes are offensive, would not excuse their Husbands indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion,
should they take pleasure to torment them with Essences
and Spanish Gloves. Let them use as much Justice in the Subject now
in question, and let them not conceive themselves innocent before
God, when they obstinately persist in torturing their Husbands with
Conversations and Customs, which though indifferent and without bad
designe, cease not to beget strange convulsions of Minde; and to cause
sometimes their Brains even to turn in their Heads.</p>
                  <p>Secondly it concerns the purity of their Reputation, that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
rid themselves of all the habits, which make way for suspitions,
and may leave any shadow of Jealousie. It is a strange Domestick; It
is impossible that it should remain long in a House without causing a
great noise and fume. Now this noise bears a part in all Tatlings and
detractions: And the same fume which makes the Husbands Head turn
round, and fills his mouth with bitternesse, slains also the reputation
of the Wife. If she be not esteemed unfaithful, she will at least be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
disobedient: And though of these two blemishes the second
be lesse sordid, and savoureth not so ill as the first; yet it is still a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
which sullies; and when Reputation comes to be once sullied
on the one side, no great scruple is made to stain it on the other.</p>
                  <p>But though Women had no Conscience nor Reputation to preserve;
yet the very interest of their quiet should be alone prevalent enough to
withdraw them from Gossipping. Certainly those small delights where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they amuse themselves, cost them strange anguishes of Minde;
and are followed with very tart reproaches. They bring not a Flower
from any suspected Walking-place which becomes not at home a Thorn
in their Heart and Head, and very often tormenting Devils approach
them in Angelical shapes; They finde a Domestick Hell under an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered
Heaven. This implies not that Jealousie doth every where
perpetrate murders, and that it alwayes imployes poison, Sword, and
halter, yet is there no place where it doth not bite and scratch. It is never
without Teeth and Nails; and its Teeth, which cause nothing but pain,
are more to be scared then Ropes and Swords, which might give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in taking away Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:55122:75"/>
A Gallant Woman will not insist upon these three Reasons where
Interest is more prevalent then Honour: She will passe to the fourth,
where Glory is most pure and Vertue is disinterested. What others
will do through terrour of Conscience, or to preserve their quiet and
good repute: she will do the same upon the sole account of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
affection, and out of a Complacencie purely conjugal. There
is yet more; and this is the last degree, to which without doubt
Women will never ascend in Troops. Her Love being Heroick, and
her Complacencie vigorous and Couragious: not only to cure her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
Husband, and to remove all the Thorns from his Heart, and
all cares out of his Head; She will rid her self of objects, even of the
shadow of objects which might nourish these Cares and Thorns. She
will even destroy her own Beauty, if he do but suspect it: she will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
her Graces, if he mistrust them of holding any intelligence
with a Forreign Love: she will dye couragiously, provided she may
die innocent, and without staining his hands with her Blood.</p>
                  <p>Although I have said that Women will not ascend in Troops to this
high degree: yet some there are, who have arrived to this Pitch, and gone
thither more innocently and couragiously, then <hi>Monima,</hi> she whom I
shall immediately produce will finde few equals. She cannot be placed in
too great a light, nor upon too fair a Stage. She cannot have too noble
Spectators: and History will never give her so many applauses and
Crowns as she deserves.</p>

                  <p>THe Wound which <hi>Hungary</hi> received at the taking of <hi>Seget</hi> was
great and dangerous: And if God had not reached out his hand,
and upheld that Kingdom; it was ready to perish by this wound.
The siege was famous by the presence of <hi>Solymon</hi> the second, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
this last Expedition with five hundred thousand men, and left
the finishing of it to his Reputation and Fortune, dying a few dayes
before the taking of the place, and almost in the sight of Victory. It
was not the Earl of <hi>Serins</hi> fault, who defended the Town, that <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
Fortune and Reputation died not there with his Person; and that
Victory did not abandon him in this Action, and remain to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Ladies of <hi>Seget</hi> did what service they could with their Jewels
and Pearls which were converted into Money for the pay of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
they served also there with their persons. And by a Zeal much
bolder then that of the Carthaginians, who gave their hair to make
Ropes for Engins of War, they employed their Arms to the repairing of
the Walls, and exposed their Heads to the defence of the breaches and
Gates.</p>

                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:55122:75"/>
At the last assault given by the Turks, the Earl of <hi>Serin</hi> perceiving
that the hour of perishing was at hand, resolved to dye most magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
and in Pomp; and to give Lustre and Reputation to his Death.
He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ought in an Imbroidered Sute, and with a string of Diamonds tyed
about his Hat, having the keyes of the Town fastned to his Scarse, and a
hundred Crowns in his Pocket for that Souldier, who should send him
to Triumph in Heaven. The History renders this testimony of his
Death; that it was a Triumphant and Victorious Death. But though
it was victorious; yet it did not equal the Death of a Ladie of <hi>Siget,</hi>
who surpasseth all that is left us of the Memory of Heroick time.</p>
                  <p>She was a Woman of quality, and one of the fairest: but she was
none of those languishing Beauties and without Vigour; of those
Beauties which resemble the stars of the North, which have no activity,
and shine faintly, and without heat. She was vigorous and bold, yet
vigorous with sweetnesse, and bold with a good Grace and Comlinesse.
Her Husband who loved her passionately, and even to the degree of
Jealousie, scared nothing but her taking in the taking of <hi>Siget.</hi> The
Image of captivated and inchained <hi>Hungary,</hi> nay of flaming and bloody
<hi>Hungary</hi> was to his apprehension a lesse dreadful apparition, then the
Image of his Captive Wife. To rid himself of this Fantome, which
followed him every where, and to secure the Honour and Freedom
of his Wife, of whom he was more Jealous, then of the Honour
of Christianity, and the Liberty of <hi>Europe;</hi> He resolved to take
her out of the World, before the Victorious Turk should enter
the City; which was no longer able to resist, and had too good hearts
left to yield themselves.</p>
                  <p>This so Tragick and soul a resolution was no sooner fixed in his
Minde, but the slains thereof appeared even in his Eyes and upon his
Face: His Wife who was discreet and quick-sighted observed them,
and was touched therewith, she pardoned his Jealousie in consideration
of his Love: And though she was fully prepared for death, yet she
did not desire a death which might make him a Criminal, whom she
loved more then her own life. She took him aside and made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that his bad intention could not be hidden from her: She
was so dexterous as to draw the confession of it from his own mouth,
and upon his Confession she strongly and efficatiously represented
to him the infamie which would remain to him from so Barbarous an
Act, and the Scandal which he would give to his Age, and leave
unto posterity. <q>I confesse said she, that I owe you all my blood;
And behold me ready to give it without reserving one drop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
have patience till some other come to shed it: Do not fullie your
hands with it; stain neither your memory nor your soul there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
Do not inkindle an eternal fire by it. For my part, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
far more Life then Death: and all the Scimiters of the Turks
cause in me far less fear, then their most gentle and pretious Chain,
were it more sweet and pretious then the Diadem of the <hi>Sultanesse.</hi> But
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55122:76"/>
permit me to die gloriously and with Reputation: Do not dishonour
the Repose which you seek, Disparage not your good affection: My
Honour is not so desperate, that it cannot be preserved but by a
Crime. You think to justifie your self by laying the blame upon Love:
You are much mistaken, if you take it for a murderer: Do not put
the Dagger into its hands: Do not solicit it to commit a murder;
and if you cannot restore it the goods you have received from it, leave
it at least its Reputation, and do not envie its Innocencie. An honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Death is not so hard a thing to find in a Town taken by force:
There enter enough of them by Gates and Breaches. Let us fallie
forth together with Swords in our hands to chuse an illustrious and
renowned end. Let it be by fire or sword; let it be short or lasting it
imports not; It will be sweet to me, provided I dye a rival to your Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and not a Victime to your Jealousie.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having said this, she caused her self to be compleatly armed, and went
out with a Sword in her hand, and a Buckler upon her arm; her Husband
followed her, armed with the like weapons, and encouraged by her
words and Example, which gave him a second Heart, and a new Spirit.
They went on boldly where fire, noise, and danger were greatest. And
as soon as they came to the place, where they were to fight between
the flaming Fire, and the victorious Army, They shewed by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
which they did, that there is no valour like the valour of despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Love, and of Graces armed in defence of their Honour. After a
long and rude fight, they were at last rather overpressed then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by a barbarous multitude, irritated by their own losses, and
their resistance: And feeling their strength stealing away with their
Blood, they gave each other their last imbraces, and fell upon a heap
of dead bodies, which had been slain by their Hands. They could not
die more sweetly then in the fruition of their mutual Fidelity: They
could not have a more magnificent Tomb, then their Arms and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Their souls which imbraced each other as well as their Bodies,
could not be severed by Death. And it was believed that God, who is
the Author of chast Unions, received them into Heaven in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and crowned them with the same Glory.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ONFESSE that this new Spectacle
hath surprised you; And that you
could not have believed the Graces so
Couragious, nor Lovers so Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
as to go in chase of Tygers and
Lyons. Besides, if it were to the chase
of Swans, which are harmonious and
amiable, and armed only with feathers:
If it were to the chase of Bees, which have nothing but honey
in their bodies, and respect Innocents and Virgins: the party
would be lesse unequal, and the divertisment lesse hazardous
and rash. Beauty which is the Mother of the Graces, and
Loves goeth also sometimes a hunting; But it is onely to the
chase of Eyes and Hearts, which have neither teeth nor nails,
and can neither bite nor scratch: And now adayes the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of this Mother have the boldness to hunt Tygers and
Lyons.</p>
               <p>But shew no fear for them; they are accompanied by <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobia,</hi>
who yesterday gave chase to the Roman Eagles, which
are more dreadfull and furious Beasts, then Lyons and Tygers.
Yes, she whom you see hunting there so gallantly, and with so
gracefull a boldnesse, is the famous <hi>Zenobia</hi> Queen of the <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myrenians,</hi>
who lately gave Chase to the Roman Eagles: And
by the defeat of the Imperiall Army, secured to her self the
Conquest of <hi>Egypt.</hi> So glorious and painfull a Chase well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
that peace and divertisments should succeed. But this
generous Woman hath not learn'd to refresh her self like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55122:78"/>
in her Closet and under a Canopy of State. Her very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is Active and Heroick: and her divertisments ars dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Combats, and essayes of Victories.</p>
               <p>You may approach without danger, and contribute at least
with your eyes to the noblest Chase which was ever given. It
is not like those which are practised in the Amphiaters of <hi>Rome,</hi>
where captive Beasts are chased by captive Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
here which is not Glorious and Noble; They are Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes
that chase, and are chased: And that which is yet more
wonderfull, Lovers are here bold, and the Graces adventerous
and dreadfull. Beauty indeed was heretofore seen armed; but
it was rather for shew then a Combat: And her weapons were
as little dangerous, as the prickets which Roses bear. <hi>Zenobia</hi>
was not content with furnishing her with Arms; she made her
warlike, and taught her all serious and practick Combats.</p>
               <p>Consider with what boldnesse she attaqu's this Lyon. It
appears by her countenance that she takes this danger for a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime
of her Courage. The fiercenesse you see in her is not a
fiercenesse of any trouble or emotion: It is a demonstration of
courage, and a tincture of boldnesse spread upon her face: It
is a valour of countenance, and a Meene of Combat: It is a
manly and military Grace: It is a tart sweetnesse, which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly
affrights which begets at once both fear and love. But
<hi>Zenobia</hi> imployes not here any thing of this tartness; she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
it for other occasions, when she is to grapple with Consuls
and Kings. This Chase is to her but a meer divertisment:
And her heart could not be more calme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor her face more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,
had she been to deal only with Beasts in a painted Cloth.</p>
               <p>Her Horse couragious by Nature, and proud of the fair
burthen he bears, casts forth his feet as if he meant to give the
first stroak, and anticipate the Javelin which is ready to part
from the Princesses hand. The chased Lyon prepares to receive
them both: And he was even ready to have cast himself upon
<hi>Zenobia;</hi> but the lightnings which her heart and spirit dart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his eyes, the flaming of those feathers which dance about her
head, and the jewels wherewith she is adorned making her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
like a flaming fire, he looks upon her with an irresolute
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55122:78"/>
Anger mixt with Fear: And you would say beholding his
posture, that he deliberates between the dazling brightnesse,
and the threatning Javelin.</p>
               <p>Disquiet not your self, and abandon the fear you expresse to
have of <hi>Zenobia;</hi> she is accustomed to overcome all sorts of
Enemies; and if she should fail of her stroke, <hi>Araspes</hi> who is
present with a sword in his Hand to second her, would have
Courage enough to draw upon himself the danger and Fury
of the Beast. He could not be worse treated by him, then he is
by his own Love, which exposeth him to a thousand cares and
vexations, tearing him in pieces without teeth or nails. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the most frightful instruments, and the greatest wounds
do not alwayes cause the greatest Torments. Such as delivered
up their Slaves to Lions, were lesse cruel then he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his own to be cast amongst Lampryes; and it were
better to be crushed in pieces by an Elephant, then to be gnawn
by Rats, or eaten up by Flies.</p>
               <p>This poor Prince <hi>Zenobia's</hi> Prisoner, even a Prisoner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Chains and Manacles, is come from a remote Countrey
to offer her his Person with his Kingdom. But he assaults a place
too well provided: and though a Scepter and a Throne be
powerful Engines; yet in vain will he bend the forces of his
Throne and Scepter against her. The Heart of <hi>Zenobia</hi> is too
well fortified against all sorts of second affections: The Name
and Image of <hi>Odenatus</hi> leaves no place empty there: And
surely she will not violate the Vow of VVidowhood which she
made to his Ghost and Memory. <hi>Eraspes</hi> is in Despair of her,
as you see; yet his Despair is respectful, and accompanied with
esteem: And he loves better <hi>Zenobia</hi> generous and inflexible,
then he would do <hi>Zenobia</hi> base and yeelding. Observe his
Respect in his very looks, his Despair by his Palenesse, and the
fire of his Heart under the Ashes of his Face. See how he
suspends his Address and Courage before his Conqueresse:
He will leave her all the Glory of the Chase: And looking on
her with imploring eyes, he demands of her for himself, the
same fair Death she prepares for the Lion: and intreats her to
do that favour at one stroke to them both. But she was satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55122:79"/>
in having wounded him with her eyes, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
to wound him by her hand. And so far was she from
taking away his life, that she was ready to have given him his
Liberty, and reduced him to himself, if he would have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
it.</p>
               <p>As for this stately Beast, he will carry no further either his
Liberty or Life: And in recompence of them both he will
have the Glory to be overcome by the same Arm, which Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday
vanquished the Roman Eagles. Her two sons who
stand by her, intend to share in her Victory, and finish with
their Bowes what she is going to begin with her Javelin, It is
not requisite that I shew them to you to make them known.
Their Beautiful and Couragious Mother is so to the Life upon
their Faces and in their Actions, as there are no Eyes so bad
which do not suddenly discern, that these two lovely Coppies
come from this fair Original. You will remain astonished to
behold in them so great Courage in so tender an Age; if you
consider that they are born of an Heroess, who possesseth all
the Graces of her Sex, and all the Vertues of ours. Her active
and contagious Courage is not only communicated to her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who grow warlike by hunting, and learn by practising
on Lions to vanquish Kings: But it animates her whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and inspires all her domesticks: And her House repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
no lesse the Court of a Queen, then the Camp of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queresse.
The most usual and chief imployment of her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks
is to fight and overcome. Her very Daughters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
valiant by her Example, and have the Generosity
of <hi>Amazons,</hi> wearing their habits, and executing their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>They stay to hunt in the neighbouring Wood: And from
hence you might have the pleasure of their Chace; you might
be Spectators of their Boldnesse and Activity, if the Trees did
not hinder your sight. Behold three of the boldest and most
diligent about the Queen, who undertake to set upon a Tyger,
which she had wounded in passing by. But he is no longer in
a condition either of saving or defending himself. The Arrow
hath pierced his shoulder, and whether he received with it
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55122:79"/>
some Charms from the hand that sent it, or whether these <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids</hi>
which binde him with strings of Myrrhe, have deprived
him of his Natural fierceness; It seems that his Wound af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
him more Glory then it gives him pain. You would say
that one single stroke doth not suffice him: and that he expects
to dye from more then one hand; and to do Honour by his
Death unto more then one Grace. And had there been some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
attractive in these shafts, had the <hi>Cupids</hi> that binde him
drawn them out of their Quivers, and lent them to these Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses
he could not expose himself to their strokes with more
Cheerfulnesse and Delight.</p>

                  <p>IT is great Pittie that so eminent a Generosity, so Heroick a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie,
so invincible a Chastity, so modest Graces, so many Vertues
of Peace and War should be damned: And that <hi>Zenobia</hi> the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious,
the Temperate and Chast, should finde as bad an Eternity as
<hi>Messaline</hi> the dissolute and incontinent. But how should we help it?
Heathen Vertues, what Beauty soever they have, how well adorned so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they be, are in fine but foolish Virgins. The Heavenly Bridegroom
knows them not: and what supplications soever they present at the gate
of his Palace, it will never be opened to them. If Chastity, Temperance,
Modesty, and Fidelity, which shall not come to him with full and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Lamps, and shall not be presented to him by Faith and Charity, will
not be admitted to these Nuptials. If there be no place there for
temperate, and modest Heathen Women, who had no warning to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
their Lamps, and to follow these lovely Guides to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom;
what will become of the licentious and debauched Christian
Women, who have broken their Lamps, contemned, and rejected their
Guides? Certainly if it be written that penitent <hi>Nineve</hi> shall condemn
incorrigible <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> it is much to be feared that the gallant <hi>Zenobia,</hi>
and other Vertuous Heathens shall rise up in the day of Judgement to
give Testimony against our Ladies, who refute their belief by their
course of life: who condemn by their Wantonnesse and excesse, the
force of Christianity, and the Austerity of the Gospel; who had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lose eternal Crowns, then part with little flowers half perished,
serving only to infect them with their ill odour, and to prick them with

                  <head type="sub">Whether Women be capable of Military Vertues?</head>
                  <p>I Dispute not here against the general practise; nor pretend by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
authority to discard an Immemorial Discipline, and a policie as
antient as Nature. Lesse also is it my designe to publish an edict by
which all Women should be summoned to War. They ought to keep
themselves to the distribution which Nature and the Laws have made,
and Custome received; and to content themselves with that part which
hath been assigned them in oeconomie and houshold affairs. I say
only, that this common Right which deprived them of Arms, hath not
rob'd them of Courage, nor cut off their Hands; that military Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are neither too unwieldy nor too harsh for them: And if it were the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55122:81"/>
good pleasure of Custome, valiant and victorious Women would not
be ranked amongst the prodigies of their Sex. The Number of them
would be as great, and the Examples as common as of Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e and Chast
Women.</p>
                  <p>First, the Heart is the essential part of Gallant and Valiant Men: It
is the Heart which begins all assaults and Combats; which gives the
first Charge, and comes off the last: and it cannot be denyed that a
Womans Heart is as vigorous, and of as good a temper as that of a Man;
if we consider that it was made by the same Hand, and formed of the
same matter. And there is some ground to believe, that it may be more
vigorous and of a better Temper: if we remember that the first Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was made of a matter already solid, and which had need of soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Moreover as Steel what hardness soever it received from Nature,
cannot be formed into the iron of a Lance nor into a Sword unlesse it be
softned: so Courage is gross and material, immoveable and unactive,
before it be sharpned: And Choler according to the saying of the
Philosopher, must be whetted that it may become Valour and service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for War. Now it is certain and experience shews it, that this
Choler which excites Courage, and gives it the title of Valour, is more
quick and sudden in Women then Men: And consequently if Custom
hath deprived them of acquired and habitual Valour, it hath not taken
from them Natural Valour, and that Spirit of Choler which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
Spirit, and the last tincture of that Humour which produces
Gallant Men.</p>
                  <p>Some will oppose to me here the delicacie of their complexion, and
the tenderness of their Temper. It will be demanded of me what
reckoning will be made of such a Hand as may be hurt by an ill sowen
Glove, or an ill polished Ring? Of such a Head as sweats under
silk, and bows under a soft Pillow? Of such a Bodie as may be pierced
through by a Beam of the Sun, and be beaten down by a single Hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone:
To this one may answer; first, that this Weakness proceeds
from the ill Education of Women and not from their temper: And
<hi>Plato</hi> observes very judiciously to this purpose, that if the excesse of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity,
which allayes their Vigour, and renders them more tender then
Men, were dried up by moderate exercise; their Complexion being
reduced thereby to a more just and exact quality then ours; their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
would become by that means stronger and more active, and have
a more free and lasting motion. Whereupon, that I may not seem to
vent a Proposition at random and without proof, he makes us observe,
that among all the Species of Animals of prey, the Females have the
swiftest pace and the strongest flight, and sight more couragiously, and
with more vigour then the Males.</p>
                  <p>In the second place we must answer, that valour doth not require
Arms of Steel, nor Hands of Iron: That the antient Hero's were not
brazen Statues: that they were not all of the Complexion of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Grecian, who wrastsed against the greatest Chains: And that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55122:82"/>
even in these dayes men dryed up by the Sun, and hardned by Frost,
are not the Persons who gain victories. Let us adde for a third answer,
that tendernesse is not so timerous as they make it, nor so incompatible
with Valour. Roses which are so Beautiful grow compleatly armed,
and though tender forbear not to prick. Bees which live within the
Honey Comb, and are sed by the Spirit of Flowers, have stings and
wage war. The Holy Scripture makes mention of a Dove which was
no lesse formidable then Eagles: And not to go so far, the Heart it self,
which is the scat of Valour, is the most tender part of the Body: It is
composed of flesh without Nerves, and Bones; hath neither Teeth nor
Nails to fortifie it. There may well then be generous Spirits and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Souls in tender Bodies, as there are good swords in Velvet Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,
as victorious Hands are seen in persumed Gloves; as Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
are lodged in painted and guilded Tents.</p>
                  <p>That if it be necessary to support reason by experience, and to make
History speak for Philosophie; it will produce from all Ages whole
Armies of couragious and warlike Women; Women Conqueresses
and victorious over men; even the most gallant and valiant amongst
men. That famous <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who deserved the Name of great by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his exploits, was defeated by <hi>Thamaris</hi> Queen of <hi>Scythia:</hi> And
the <hi>Scythiaus</hi> themselves who were all born Souldiers, and had no other
Countrey nor Houses then a Camp and Tents, were overcome by the
<hi>Amazons.</hi> That famous <hi>Semiramis</hi> to whom a Prophet gave the Name
of Dove, was indeed a Dove in her Closet, even a voluptuous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed

and chase couragiously and with vehemency. <hi>Joan</hi> Countess
of <hi>Mountfort,</hi> and Daughter to <hi>Lewis</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> was one of these
ever generous and bold Eagles. Her whole Life was a perpetual War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
or a continual preparation to it. Her first divertisments were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
and manly: And at the Age when Maids begin to see the World
to go to Bals, and shew themselves at publick Meetings; she began to
learn the riding of great Horses, running at Tilt and fighting at Banners.</p>
                  <p>She learnt all these Exercises without forgetting the Bashfulness of
her Sex, without taking off from sweetness or discomposing Graces:
And there was alwayes upon her Face, and in all her Actions, a mixture
of Beauty and Valour; a tincture mingled with Boldness and Modesty,
and a certain Air like that of <hi>Minerva,</hi> drawn by the antient Painter,
who was armed and yet appeared a Virgin. Her Valour likewise was
not a Valour for Carrousels and Turnaments: and her Gallantry was
not painted and specious. From counterfeit VVars and Chamber Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats,
she passed to real VVars, and Field Encounters: she was present
at Sieges and Naval Battels: she gained all kindes of Victories, and
merited all sorts of Crowns.</p>

the pursuit of his right by a seizure: and assisted by the VVit and
courage of the Countess his Wife, partly by Force, and partly by dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetity,
he gained the most considerable places of the Province. <hi>Charls</hi>

adjudged the difference about succession in his Favour: And the King
committed the Execution of the Decree to his Son the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>

                  <p>This fall of the Count must evidently occasion the Ruine of his
Countesse, As they say, the Death of the Male Palm is followed by
that of the Female; But all Loves are not of the same complexion,
nor subject to the same Symptomes. The generous Widow remained
unshaken between her Husbands Death, which lay extreamly heavy on
her heart, and the war he left upon her shoulders: And it was a hard task
for a Widow to stand out against all <hi>France,</hi> her Enemie and in Arms.
She visited in Person all the Towns of her Party: she setled the affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

there; the French Armies marched to besiege <hi>Henebond,</hi> to
which place the Countesse betook her self with her choisest friends: She
manfully sustained the siege, and served there with her whole Person:
She acted no lesse with her armes then with her heart and head; And she
alone was of more use then many Souldiers and Captains. She gave out
Orders, and was the first in executing the Orders given: She made one
in all the Sallies, and assisted at all the Assaults. And when she ascended
upon the walls, and went through the streets mounted on a warlike
horse and compleatly armed, the lightning of her eyes and the fire of
her heart spread upon her face, and this Valour of carriage and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
which reinforc'd her Beauty, and gave it a quicknesse, did
encourage the most scarful, and awaked the most drowsie and faint-hearted.</p>
                  <p>One day, when the Besiegers equally irritated by her resistance, and
their own losses come to a general Assault, the Couragious Princesse
having for defence set in order all her people, even her Women and
Maids, whom her example had made warlike, ascended unto the top
of a Tower to discover the state of the sight: And as soon as shee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
that none but servants were left for the Guard of the Camp; she
came down from the Tower, took Horse and Sallying forth by a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55122:83"/>
Gate in the head of three hundred Cuirassiers she fired the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Quarters. The smoak and flame called them quickly back to the
defence of their Tents and Baggage. The Countesse having done her
work, made a Gallant Retreat in the sight of her Pursuers: And the
wayes of <hi>Herel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>and</hi> being shut up, she got with her Party into <hi>Aulroy.</hi> The
besieged were five dayes without hearing any tidings of her: Meanwhile
she made up five hundred Horse: And the sixth day very early in the
morning she presented her self before the face of the Camp: She forced
all that she found in her way, and entred the City with a great sound
of Trumpets: Victory her self could not enter more Gloriously, not be
received with more joy.</p>
                  <p>It was not onely her work to resist Force and Engins rais'd against the
Walls, but the was to defend her self against Stratageins, and to contest
with those artifices which slack the courage of her people, and debauch
them from her service. But in fine, her Prudence, her Dexterity, and
the Eloquence of her intreaties accompanied with her presents, stayed
them till the arrival of the English succours which raised this first Siege.
She procured afterwards a Cessation of Arms, which gave her time to
passe over into <hi>England,</hi> and in Person to sollicite new aids. Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
Civility, and all the Graces asked them in her behalf, and caused
them to be Imbarked: Her Valour and Fortune preserued them at
Sea, and rendred them Victorious in <hi>Britany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Naval Army of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Blois</hi> having set upon her before the
Islands of <hi>Garnsey,</hi> the manifested that her Valour was for both Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and that she had as good a Heart, and as solid a Head in a ship,
as upon a Bulwark and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>renches. She fought all the day with a Sword
in her Hand, under a storm of Iron and Fire, and amongst many dead
Bodies of different forms and all of them frightful enough. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
she did neither sink under Iron nor Fire: she beheld with a sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saft
Eye all the shapes of these bloody and gastly dead Corps: And
though they had been more terrible and in greater numbers, she would
not have sailed to carry away the Victory in the midst of them, if the
Night and Tempest which intervened had not taken it out of her hands.
As soon as she landed with her Troops, she marched directly to <hi>Vanues,</hi>
and began the War afresh by besieging this Place. Her presence and
Example proved the two strongest Instruments wherewith the Walls
were beaten down. And the Town at last being taken by Force after
several assaults, in which she sought both with Voice and Hand, she
made her entry on horseback, and like a Conqueress.</p>
                  <p>If I were to follow this Victorious Woman in all occasions, and in all
the fights at which she was present; I should write here a History of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeers: It sufficeth to say for conclusion, that after divers Sieges and
Battels, she placed the Crown upon her Sons' head. And if she had lived
in an Age of Statues and triumphant Arches, she would still triumph in
Marble and Brass, upon all the Gates and publick Places of all the Cities
in Brittany, as she still sights and will fight eternally in our History.</p>

               <p>HOw dangerous a Good is Beauty! how difficult
is it to keep! and to what strange Adventures is
it exposed! I know not whether the danger
would be so great to have the keeping of a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
Beast in ones house, as to harbour a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
woman: or whether the Graces, I say the modest and

Innocence; they bite but till their hunger is satisfied: and
there are some Feasts which bad Fortune celebrates: there
are days of Truce for those whom she persecutes. Beauty
knows none of those days of Truce, nor those intervals of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency.
Her very Complacences are dangerous, and her
Repose is to be feared. And to the end you may know that it
is not only a debauched and licentious Beauty which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive,

her self, who was so severe to her own Beauty, and kept it
so watchfully, and under so great restraint, happens to be
newly murthered by it.</p>
               <p>You may have peradventure heard of the undiscreet gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
of those Princes who are in the Camp of <hi>Ardea.</hi> The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55122:85"/>
other day they entred into discourse concerning the merit of
their VVives, and every one giving the prize to his own, it
was resolved that the Eyes should be chosen Iudges of this
difference: without adjourning the agreement to the next
day, they all took horse together, and rid Post to <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>Collatia.</hi> It is said that all the voices were for <hi>Lucrecia:</hi> she
gained unhappily an advantage, which she did not dispute:
and this unfortunate and fatal Purchase cost her the loss of
her Honour and Life. Young <hi>Tarquin</hi> of his own Nature
Arrogant and full of Pride, and inheriting from his Father
the name of Proud, being returned to <hi>Collatia,</hi> and received
by <hi>Lucrecia</hi> as her Husbands Friend, came with a Sword in
his hand to surprize her in Bed, and offered her a Violence
which surpasses the Title of Proud and Tyrant. I will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with the particulars of this Attempt, but only say,
that by break of day the poor VVoman, grown desperate in
her Misfortune, sent in all haste for her Husband <hi>Collatin,</hi>
and <hi>Lucrecius</hi> her good Father; They being come, with <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Valerius</hi> their intimate Friends, she with Tears related
to them the sad Accident of her violated Chastity: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
engaged them by Oath to Revenge it, she on a sudden,
preventing their Excuses and foresight of her Intention,
struck her self to the Heart with a Dagger which she kept
hid under her Gown. Behold the last Act of this funestous
Tragedy; which will perchance have yet more sad sequels:
and you are come very seasonably to receive the last sights of
the first Roman Heroesse.</p>
               <p>She gave her self but one blow, and all that were present
received it. A stream of blood ran from <hi>Lucrecia's</hi> VVound:
Streams of Tears flowed from her Husbands and Fathers
VVound: And of these tvvo sorts of VVounds, I know not
which is the deepest and most painfull. I know not whether
the blood comes more from the Center of the heart, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it slides away with more resentment, then the tears. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it were, <hi>Lucrecia</hi> appears well satisfied with the stroke
she newly gave her self. You would say that with her blood
there issues forth something, I know not what, that is lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55122:85"/>
and clears the dark clouds which the shame of the
last night had left in her eyes, and on her brow. You would
say that her Innocence and purity of heart are seen through
her wound: and her wound is to her, as it were, a new
mouth, which cals upon the eyes, and perswades in silence.
Do you hear what this mouth, eloquent without noise, and
perswasive without words, uttereth: It protests against the
outrages and tiranny of the <hi>Tarquins:</hi> it implores the revenge
of Gods and Men, and doubtless it will obtain it from them
both, and obtain it by the voice of her blood, which is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
and bold, which is animated with indignation and
justice, which is full of a Roman spirit and vertue.</p>
               <p>There is nothing seen effeminate or weak in her person;
nothing which is not either a proof of her innocence, or a
mark of her courage: And though there were no other testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
for her, yet her justification is clear and manifest in
her looks, in the ayr of her face and countenance. The tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of vertue is not there a superficial painting, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of art; it is there interiour and natural: it hath been
still entertained by the effusions of her heart, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ayes of
her soul: And now that her soul hath abandoned it, and
that her heart pours it self out through her wound, this fair
tincture resists still the colour of death, which effaces all the
rest; you will not believe that I say too much, if I aver that
it would neither submit to the stain of vice, nor to the dye of
impudence.</p>
               <p>You may have seen bashfulness elsewhere: All honest wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have this tincture, and the brown should have it as well
as the fair. You may have also observed modesty elsewhere;
it is a natural ornament, and no costly dress, which may be
used by rich and poor. But perhaps you may have never
seen but upon this face a couragious bashfulness, and a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and heightned modesty. This temper belongs to the
ancient Heroesses, who armed the Graces, and led them forth
to the wars. Those of <hi>Lucrecia,</hi> though not warlike, appear
not less bold; and her beauty, though brought up in the
shade, and under a veil, hath no less vigour or courage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55122:86"/>
Nevertheless this powerfull and couragious beauty begins
to decay, and these wounded Graces will quickly expire one
after another. Mean while it is apparent that the loss of their
Honour doth more disorder them, and is more sensible to
them then the loss of life. Their shame is still fresh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and fear is not yet come upon them. Their blushes do
not vanish, though their spirits steal away with their blood;
and before they die of their wound, they will expire with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
for having complyed with the last nights crime, though
they then assisted without being seen, and by meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Collatin,</hi> who had the greatest loss by this accident, seems
the most afflicted: He supports <hi>Lucrecia,</hi> who sinks between
his arms; and he himself would need anothers arms, if he
were not sustained by wrath, which came to the succour of
his heart, and inflamed his countenance. Seised as he was
with wrath and grief, indignation and pitty, he could not
express himself but by his eyes; and his tears, since his voice
failed him, bid unto <hi>Lucrecia</hi> the last adieu, and confirm to
her the good opinion he had of her Innocence.</p>
               <p>To this discourse of tears, <hi>Lucrecia</hi> makes answer with
blood, and sighs: She casts down her eyes upon her wound,
as if she meant to give a sign to <hi>Collatin</hi> to behold at least her
naked heart through this gaping wound. I believe that the
last motion of her lips is an oath, whereby she assures him
that he shall find it free from the stains of her body; that he
shall meet there with no other image then his own, nor any
print of a forraign flame: and that if there remain still any
ashes of it, they are the ashes of a lawfull fire, which he alone
hath inkindled, and which is no less pure then the sacred fire
of the <hi>Vestals.</hi> Though there be nothing but spirit and
breath in this oath, yet it is understood by <hi>Collatin,</hi> who
makes the like protestation of fidelity for the future. But it is
only exprest in tears and sighs, he hath forgotten all other
terms: And <hi>Lucrecia,</hi> who yet well understands them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
the protestation of his eyes, and consigns it to her soul,
which carries it with joy to the other world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55122:86"/>
                  <hi>Brutus,</hi> who stands by, makes a third protestation, which
is of a different form, and will not be accomplished but with
fire and sword. The countenance you behold in him is not
his ordinary meen: The language he speaks is new to him,
and without doubt the Genius of <hi>Rome</hi> hapening to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at this action, appeared to him, and inspired him to the
full. It is from his light this Romans eyes are ardent, and his
whole face as flaming fire: It is with his spirit he is possessed,
and they are his words which issue forth of his mouth.
VVith one hand he holds the bloody Dagger which he
but newly drew forth of <hi>Lucrecia's</hi> wound, and seems to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it as a sacrifice to the Genius that speaks to him; the other
he lifts to Heaven; and accompanying with his voice and
fire, the voice and smoke of the chaste blood, which distils
from the fatall Dagger, he vows to the Gods and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
the ruin of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> and the extirpation of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</p>
               <p>This new fire stayes not with him: it passes to <hi>Valerius</hi> and
<hi>Lucrecius</hi> the Father: It dryes up the tears upon their Cheeks,
and sadness in their hearts, and inkindles in place thereof an
anger, which is yet but a particular and domestick fire, and
such an one as will soon set <hi>Rome</hi> and all <hi>Italy</hi> in an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
flame. These two grave Senators confirm by their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
and countenance the same oath which <hi>Brutus</hi> takes:
Their fiery eys and their faces grown young again, by a heat
unknown to their age, swear in the same form to extirpate
the <hi>Tarquins. Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of this amazement, he will mingle his zeal with theirs: And
all four consecrating themselves to liberty and revenge, by
touching that blood which this woman gathers up, they
joyntly renewed their vow to <hi>Lucrecia's</hi> Ghost. And <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Vcrecia</hi> complains in these verses of her rigorous usage, and of
the charge laid against her, to the dishonor of her Memory. I
have seen this charge, and the sentence annext to it in the Books
of the City of God: I have been present sometimes at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
which one of the highest and strongest Vertues of her Sex is
wont to make against her: And I confess, that if she be judged by the
Christian Rule, and the Laws of the Gospel, she will be hardly able to
justifie her Innocence. The most favourable will be at least of S. <hi>Austins</hi>
opinion, and conclude with him, that she neither merited the death she
gave her self, if she were innocent in her dishonour; nor the praises she
received, if she were guilty of it.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, were she withdrawn from this severe Tribunal, where no
Heathen Vertue appears, which is not in danger to be condemned: were
she to be judged by the Law of her own Country, and by the Religion of
her time, she will be found one of the chastest Women of her Age, and
one of the most couragious of her Country: Noble and Vertuous Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
which so often accuseth her, will absolve her of her disaster, and be
reconciled to her; and every one will confess that her sin is less ascribable
to her own fault, then to the imperfection of the Law, which had ill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
her, and to the scandals of that Religion which had given her but
bad presidents.</p>
                  <p>In effect, the Law of that Country was then but specious and superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial;
the Moral was only applyed to plaister over the exteriour, to imitate
the countenance and gestures of Vertue, to make fair masks and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
delusions: It touched not upon corrupted intentions, it had no Rule
for inordinate desires; and in case depraved passions came not so far as
to ill effects, yet it abandoned them to their own sense, and permitted their
hearts to enjoy a liberty more then popular: It allowed them an unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable
and unrestrained freedom. As for the Religion of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
which erected Courtisans into Goddesses, and sacrificed to Adulterers, it
was not to be expected that it should produce Virgins and chaste Women.
Therein <hi>Lucrecia,</hi> even ravished <hi>Lucrecia</hi> was better then the Gods of <hi>Rome.</hi>
It was not the love of pleasure, nor the fear of death which induced her to
sin, but the love of Honour, and the excessive fear she had to lose it: and
if she were not endowed with the resolution of <hi>Susa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s,</hi> who sunk neither
under death nor infamy, it suffices to say in her excuse, that she knew not
the God of <hi>Susanna:</hi> And the miracle would have been too great, it a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Woman had equalled one of the highest Vertues amongst the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
without the Law, and the Graces, which made them so.</p>
                  <p>Let us not forbear then to commend <hi>Lucrecia,</hi> she is worthy of our
praises. Ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath been the Nurse of sublime natural ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
&amp; of great Pagan Heroes, hath brought forth nothing more high and
great, nothing more gallant and couragious, then <hi>Lucrecia.</hi> This great City
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55122:88"/>
was the Exterminatrix of insolent Kings, and the Mother of the Common-wealth:
And to bring into the World this famous Maid, who ought to have
commanded so many Nations, she opened her own bosom, and procured
to her self a remarkable and violent death. Therein she was more glorious
and worthy of esteem then the Mother of the first <hi>Caesar,</hi> whose belly was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> up to make way for the Usurper, whom she bore in her womb. The
outragious Villain who offered violence to her Honour, did not dishonor
her: Honour stuck close to Vertue, and Vertue cannot be torn out of the
heart, it must fall of it self. Being unable with her single hands to resist
armed Force, she repelled it with her minde; and her soul raised it self as
much as it could, not to be stained with the impurity which defiled her
body. Besides, she was willing to cleanse it with her blood: and the zeal
of her Modesty was so great, as she punished upon her self the unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which another had committed.</p>

But whether he hath been the Author of this novelty, which gives so ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
whether he had learnt it by tradition, or whether the Philosophers

of an amarous and pretending Poet, who sought to accommodate

                  <p>They must then keep themselves to that Morality which all Nations

that chastity is an essential part appertaining to the honor of their whole

so efficacious and luminous, as they purifie vice, and give lustre and grace
to sin? surely it would be very strange, if out of the ordures and infection
of petty Bourgers houses, gold and perfumes should be made in Pallaces, if
tattered garments, which would discredit the wife of a mean shopkeeper
should adorn a Princess; If the dirt of the hands and feet should become
a Paint and Ornament of the head, if spots which appear unseemly in a
little Star should not be so in a great Planet: This would be to relapse into
the error of the Ancient Idolaters, who sung Hymns to their adulterous
Gods, and punished their servants for the same crimes: who adored in
publike debauched and pratling Goddesses, and at home preached chastity
to their wives and daughters.</p>
                  <p>I add hereunto, that by the right of Nature, and by the Order established
in the world Greatness and Nobility have a particular obligation to purity.
The noblest spirits and the most elevated Intelligences, are, if I may say so,
the purest Virgins, and the freest from the staines of matter. The Planers,
who are the Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s and Nobles of the corporeal world, have the advantage
in point of purity, as well as in that of Greatness and Nobility. And not
only fire, which is the superior Element, is purer then the rest; but it is also
more purifying, and a more declared enemy to whatever defileth. By the
same reason gold and silver, which are the Soveraign Mettals, are esteemed
for their purity; And the same purity gives a value to Pearls and precious
Stones, which are, as a gallant person said, the Majesty of abbreviated
Nature. Regulation observed with so hansome order and so just a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of things, is to Princesses and great Ladies a Law of purity which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55122:89"/>
they have found in their birth. It cannot be more lawful for them to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with it by the moral Doctrine of <hi>Tassus,</hi> then it can be permitted by
the Philosophy of Chymicks, that either Gold should be mixt with Brass,
or Diamonds be blemisht with Flaws.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if Chastity be a natural Ornament, and an easie attire without
art, which is proper and peculiar to the second Sex, I see not why it should
less appertain to the condition of <hi>Heroesses,</hi> then those fancied Ornaments,
and such cumbersome rich Dresses, in which they are so curious. It would
be very strange that they who might not decently apparel themselves in
course cloth, might yet appear decently without the robe of chastity, and
that nature had made for them the whiteness of Pearls and the fire of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonds,
and for others the whiteness of chastity, and the fire of modesty.
And assuredly Nature hath not given them so many Beauties, nor imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them so lively lights, which we ordinarily observe in them, to the
end these Beauties should be prophaned, and these lights obscured; and
that by their prophanation and staines they should scandalize such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them. She is too jealous of so excellent things: The exact curiosities
wherewith she hath ranked them, the care she hath had to preserve them
for the purest part of the world, are marks visible enough of what she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
from great Ladies, to whom she uses to be so liberal of such treasures.</p>
                  <p>And if modesty be an Ornament proper to their quality as well as to
their Sex, it cannot be denyed, but the contrary vice is by the same reason
a stain to them both, nay a stain so much the baser, as the subject upon
which it fals, is of a higher birth, or of a more elevated fortune. And therein

the magnanimous and debauched <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Surely it is great pitty
that so many Vertues have been so ill lodg'd, and with so bad company.
And since the Holy Ghost hath compared fair women who are not wise,
to Sowe's adorned with bracelets of gold: since a Philosopher hath said,
that fair ignorant persons were vessels of Allabraster fill'd with vineger, we
may also say by the same reason that these magnanimous, debauched, and
these learned, licentious women were full fraught vessels, and loaden with
dirt, magnificent Pallaces, and infected with Ordure and unwholsome air;
costly Monuments, and filled with putrifaction. And therefore we must
conclude, that modesty is a vertue necessary for <hi>Hercesses;</hi> And that great
Ladies have more interest in its conservation, then those that are inferior
to them both in birth and fortune. The discourse by which <hi>Tassus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
to prove the contrary, is scandalous: And if I might be credited, he
would be condemned by the express sentence of all Ladies; And his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
would be banished out of all Closets, and Chambers, as Poets his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
were heretofore out of the Commonwealth of <hi>Plato.</hi>

<hi>Dagolert,</hi> was born with all the Graces and Advantages she could receive
from Nature. Her Nobility was of a Race which had this quality of the

Heroick spirits. Her beauty was soveraign by right of Nature, which reigns
without strong holds and Armies. Her wit and courage might have made
a Conqueror, if it had been placed in another Sex. Nevertheless it was a
courage without cruelty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was a wit tempered with sweetness and force:
And as for her vertue, it was so pure, and of so good odour, as it pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
all her actions, and left no part of her life, upon which detraction it
self could colourably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>asten an untruth.</p>
                  <p>Being advantaged by this natural endowment, which was more to be
esteemed then all the Crowns Fortune could give her, she was espoused to
<hi>Arioldus</hi> King of <hi>Lombardy.</hi> The first years of her marriage were happy and
peaceable, either by her carriage, which was pleasing and dexterous, or by
the power of her vertue, which wrought successfully upon <hi>Arioldus</hi> heart,
and disposed him sweetly to contribute his esteem and complacences to
this domestick felicity. Nevertheless as there be Serpents which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
enemies to fair Flowers; and as Dogs do not bark against the Moon
but when she is perfect, and possesses all her light; so there be jealous
Devils who have a particular spite against pleasing and illustrious vertues:
and it was one of these infernal Spirits who impoysoned the mind of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oldus,</hi>
and changed the happy state of <hi>Gondeberga.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She had in her service a young Lord, native of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> named <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>sus,</hi>
a person of a gracefull aspect, and full of courage; who besides his
exteriour gallantry, had also that which was useful and serviceable in the
Field. But as the most part of Court Vertues, to qualifie them rightly, are
but sportive, and painted Vertues; but poor ones, which act the part of
Queens, and deformed ones with fair masks: so this gracefull meen, and
great courage of <hi>Adalulsus,</hi> covered a dangerous pride; and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
presumption lay hid under this Gallantry. Nevertheless, whether
these defects were covered over with so curious a plaister, and so artificially
applyed, as nothing of it appeared to the eyes of the Queen, whether she
suspected it to proceed rather out of Youth then any formed malice, or that
she really believed that vertues did lose nothing of their grace in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of vices, she did not forbear to have a singular esteem of him, and to
reserve those favours and kindnesses for him, which she had for no body
else.</p>
                  <p>These favours indeed were very innocent and pure: and there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
undecent and immodest in these kindnesses. But discretion was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55122:90"/>
wanting: and <hi>Gondeberga</hi> should not have trusted so much to her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and the purity of her intentions, as not to remember, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so pure, which may not be impurely interpreted; and that even the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Roses, innocent as it is, serves for matter of poyson to Spiders. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
there are some men so vain, and so well perswaded of their own merit,
as they cannot believe that a woman, what preservatives soever she may
carry about her, and with what Vertues soever she is guarded, can look
upon them without forfeiting her liberty at first sight, and her reason at the
second. And the extravagancy of some proceeds so far, as to perswade
themselves, almost with the good man of the Comedy, that the Dog-daies,
and the Southern wind, which cause Feavors, are less dangerous to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
then their presence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adolulsus</hi> was one of these good people; he easily believed that the
esteem which <hi>Gondeberga</hi> expressed towards him, proceeded from passion.
He took her civilities and favours for coloured Courtships, and fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of a vanquished Chastity, which was willing to be summoned, to
the end it might surrender with Ceremony, and according to the forms of
War. Adding temerity to this Vision, he had the impudence to speak to
her of Love, and to violate Majesty by the impurity of his mouth, and
by the blasphemies of a sacrilegious solicitation. <hi>Gondeberga,</hi> who was one
of those generous Ladies, who are not to be touched without punishment,
and who have thorns of Roses, as well as their Graces &amp; Blushes; remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a while without making any reply, either because she feared to prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
her voice and soul to the ears of this infamous person, or that she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated
on the punishment of his Audacity, she suddenly rose up, and
without other answer, spit in his face at her departure.</p>
                  <p>I expect indeed that gentle spirits will not approve this quickness, and
that they will alledge against her the address &amp; moderation of the wise and

the boldness of the <hi>Lombard,</hi> who violated the sanctity of a Crown,
which came neer to Sacriledge, was another kind of folly, then that of the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> which related more to his head then heart: who was respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

treated in the same manner. And if mildness were seasonably used by the
Princess of <hi>Spain</hi> towards a melancholy Innocent, who discoursed not of
his folly, but to windows, and only expressed himself by his guittar in his
Serenades. The severity was no less opportune, which the <hi>French</hi> Lady ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
on a furious person, who had need of chains.</p>

and dispersed its bad odour as far as <hi>France.</hi> He represented to himself, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55122:91"/>
in affairs of this nature one ought not to be fearfully wicked, and by halfes;
that bold and consummated Crimes were the most successful, and that
since the King could not sail to be advertised of what had happened,
it were good to begin first, and turn the storm upon the head of
Gondeberga.</p>
                  <p>Being fortified by this resolution, and his natural Audacity, he presented
himself before the King with the face of an Impostor, and a countenance
versed in the art of dissimulation and lying. <q>He began by a counterfeit
grief &amp; false regrets: He complains of the harshness of a new duty, which
changeth the duties of his condition, and offers violence to his honor.
He calls that necessity, cruel, and unfortunate, which enforces him to
become an informer against a person, who was sacred to him, and for
whom he would have exposed a thousand lives. And after a tedious

nothing but a fit conjuncture to execute this design. And that if an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
and couragious prudence were not opposed to so pressing a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and which hung already over his head; it is to be feared that his
delay and circumspection might prove fatal to him; And that a moment

upon the State.</q>

the confusion of wandring thoughts, and ballanced between belief and

last upon the testimony of <hi>Adalulsus,</hi> the contestation was great in his heart
between a Husband and a King between Love and Fear: And these pieces
being so neer to him, and so contrary in themselves, he neither presented to
his mind an expedient, whereby he might reconcile them, nor any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
reason upon which he might justly give sentence for either. At last
he submitted to fear, and declared for the King, upon whose conservation
the Husband depended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And being perswaded, that in dangers of this nature

the Queen, and caused her to be carried to the Castle of <hi>Amello,</hi> where during
the space of three years she had commerce with no person whatsoever:
And light it self beheld her only by intervals and stealth.</p>
                  <p>The wise Princess patiently did acquiesce to the will of the King her
Husband; And endured this civil death with a constancy, which shewed
cleerly that there was something in her more noble then her blood, and
more Soveraign then her Crown. This trial, though harsh and painful,
proved not unprofitable to her. It gained her the consummation, and the
last purity of vertue: And when God perceived this last purity, and this
compleatment, which forms great Examples and Heroick models, he

and defends it against the scandalous Morality of <hi>Tassus:</hi> But one may also
draw other lights from thence, which are no less instructive, nor less use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for the direction of Ladies. First, this so pure affection of <hi>Gondeberga</hi>
towards <hi>Ada<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lsus,</hi> ought to teach our malicious Criticks, that very often
what they find of ill Odour in particular actions, proceeds from the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
disposition of their own brains; That they take sometimes Stars for
Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts; and that they suspect impurity and corruption even in those
friendships, where there is nothing but a pure spirit, a most pure light, and a
fire loosned from matter.</p>
                  <p>But it is not enough for Amities to be pure and innocent, they ought
to be considerate and reserved, and must take heed of making indiscreet
advances. Rash and presumptuous <hi>Adalulsus</hi> are to be found every where,
who have alwayes prepared matter to inkindle a fire out of the least sparks
of affection which are discovered to them. And what most imports, is, that
they cannot be satisfied with a secret temerity, and an interior presumption.
They become confident by their imaginary conquests. They dream of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55122:92"/>
and fortunes, and divulge them when they are awake. They counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Assignations, and forge Letters; And these counterfeit Assignations are
followed by real quarrels: These forged Letters inkindle fire in Families,
and blast the best Fames, and the most innocent lives; surely such must
needs be incorrigible who cannot be converted by so many examples. And
though the sacred scripture forbids us to lament an Inchanter, who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
himself to be stung by a Serpent which he himself hath charmed,
yet is he more to be deplored then a woman who confides in so deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a faith as that of men, and hazards her reputation upon oaths which
have been so often broken.</p>
                  <p>In fine, misbelieving Christians and baptized Epicures will learn from
the double revolution of this Tragedy, that although truth and justice do
not visibly intervene in all actions which are represented upon the Theatre
of this world, yet we cannot say that they sleep behind the Scene, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
there idle. They suffer there indeed confusion and disorder for a time,
but it is not a perpertual confusion, nor a disorder without art. And this art
cannot appear till the conclusion, to which they by design reserve the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
of Innocence, and the punishment of Calumny.</p>

Fugitives: The River where you pass is
rapid and full of danger: and though it be of
your party, and a Roman like you, yet one
may fear that it approves not of your flight:
and that it carryes you away to Sea, instead of bringing you
back to <hi>Rome.</hi> But I may cry out with open mouth, and with
all my strength, yet cannot be heard. It is impossible for my
voice to reach them amidst the confused clamors, and the
pressing outcryes of a whole Camp pursuing them. The
tumult as you see is great upon the shore. The whole Army
near upon have quit their Tents: you would say that the
signal is but now given either for a battel, or a general assault;
and this tumultuary Sally, and with so much noise, is only
design'd to apprehend nine or ten Maids who are fled from
thence.</p>
               <p>Do not believe that this accident is a prank of the Devil,
who causeth panick fears: much less is it to be taken for a
game of Fortune, of this insolent and fantastical Sportress,
who often raises these fears in the greatest Kings and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
It is a mysterie of <hi>Romes</hi> Genius: It is a serious presage
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55122:94"/>
of her future Empire, and a certain forerunner of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
which are ordained her: For it is fit to inform you
where you are, and to render you an account of the spectacle
which begets your astonishment.</p>
               <p>This River is <hi>Tyber</hi> the nurse of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is not yet adored
by other Rivers, and acknowledged by all Seas. It is not yet
crowned with Triumphant Arcks, Obelisks and Amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aters,
as one day it will be: And nothing but initiated Towers
and imperfect VValls appear upon its Banks, which are as
it were the swath-bands of the yet Infant Republike. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
it rolls along gravely and with pomp: And as if it
were already sensible of its future glory, you would say that
it doth accustome it self betimes to the <hi>Roman</hi> dignity, and
the Majesty of the <hi>Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for these <hi>Maids</hi> who so boldly and with so much
danger pass it over, are of the chief Families of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
Companions of <hi>Claelia.</hi> The <hi>Senate</hi> had delivered them up for
Hostages of the Treaty made with <hi>Porcena,</hi> who but yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
kept the City besieged, and endeavored to replace the
<hi>Tarquins.</hi> But being perswaded by <hi>Claelia</hi> that their detention
was an imprisonment sweetned by specious terms, and by
forms unknown both to their Sex and Age, and that in other
respects it stood not with their honor nor the dignity of the
Commonwealth to suffer so fair a portion of <hi>Rome</hi> to be led
Captive into <hi>Tuscany,</hi> they made an escape out of the Camp
by confederacy: And behold them crossing <hi>Tyber</hi> with a
boldness, which will compleat the liberty of their Country,
and be recompenced with Elogies and Statues.</p>
               <p>The noise of it is great, and the astonishment general
through the whole Camp of <hi>Porcena.</hi> He came himself to
the Sea side to be a spectator of his second defeat, and of the
disorder in his Army. The loss of a battel would have less
weakned him then this bold Act which assaulted his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and overcame him without effusion of blood. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of <hi>Mucius,</hi> who lately undertook to kill him in the
midst of his Camp, had apparently left him more courage
and hope to overcome the fortune of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to humble
the pride of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:55122:94"/>
He resented indeed this adventure, wherein he saw all his
designes ruin'd and his reputation lost. But he resents it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously
and like a King: His astonishment was not bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and stupid: He was not one of those unjust persons,
who can only esteem such Vertues, as are their stipendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and wear their Liveries. He looks with respect upon
the presages of the growing Monarchy: And though he hath
taken upon him a superficiall and exteriour anger to satisfie
his irritated people, and to contribute something to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
Treaty; yet interiourly, and in his heart he applauded
this boldness, and submitted the <hi>Tuscan</hi> Fortune to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</hi>
He will presently make a greater noise, and send De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
to the Senate to complain of the breach of Faith by the
Fugitives, and to require restitution of them. But he will
only restrain his anger till their return: And changing his
part as soon as he shall have them in his power, he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
his Complaints into Praises. He himself will compose an
Elogy of <hi>Claelia,</hi> and seriously, and with a solid reward crown
the same Vertue which he menaceth with his countenance.</p>
               <p>The Soldiers who went disorderly out of their Tents, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not so much Honor to his Vertue, nor look upon it with
so respectfull and peaceable an eye. The alteration appears as
extream in their spirits: and their indiscreet and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
anger clearly demonstrates, that in Armies, sound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not common, and reason resides ordinarily all in the
Generall. Cast your eyes in this occasion upon these who
are as immovable, as if this adventure had charmed them:
You would take them for armed Statues, or for Gyants that
sleep standing, and with open eyes. They have likewise but
an uncertain and confused sight, and the least amazed
amongst them cannot say, whether he sees what is done, or
whether he dreams. Behold others who stretch forth and
stir their arms, as if they had wings, and were to flie after these
Maids. But whatever hath been said of <hi>Icarus,</hi> they will not
rise up from the ground with their arms; and their whole
flight being meerly imaginary, nothing but their reproaches
and imprecations will pass the River. The arrows of these
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55122:95"/>
Archers are much more to be feared by <hi>Claelia</hi> and her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions:
They have iron teeth and reall wings; they can
flye faster, and wound more dangerously then the reproaches
and imprecations of the rest. Behold the straining of some
in bending their Bows, and the strength of others in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
their Arrows. Let us cry out to them to spare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and disarmed Beauties, and not to offer violence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Sex for which VVar and Barbarity it self hath respect;
to pardon at least the Graces of <hi>Rome,</hi> if they will not honor
its Vertues, and submit to its Fortune. But by no means, let
them alone; their Arrows will be more humane and discreet
then themselves; they will better understand the rights of
their Sex, and the common respects which are due to them.
The noise they make in the ayr, is as it were a complaint of
the violence which hath been offered them: You would not
take them for Courriers sent after these Fugitives; you would
take them for other Fugitives, who save themselves after the
first. Some fall down at <hi>Claelia's</hi> feet, others sink before her
Companions, and all these Arrows plunging themselves in
the River, assure them by their fall that they come not to
hurt them.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the couragious Damsels recover the other
shore, where Glory and the Genius of the Republike expects
them. <hi>Claelia,</hi> who instigated them, is still their guide, and
advances first upon a Horse generous by Nature, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
proud with the Beauty and Nobleness of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
That other so famous Beast upon which <hi>Europa</hi> cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Sea of <hi>Creete,</hi> was less stately, and swam less gallantly,
and with less pomp. See how he manages his feet in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and cadence, and how his lofty head salutes afar off the
Towers of <hi>Rome.</hi> Surely he would merit to be consecrated,
as well as the she VVolf, which was Nurse to the Founders
of the City. And the <hi>Senate</hi> will appoint him at least a <hi>Statue,</hi>
and cause her memory to be kept in Marble.</p>
               <p>She that governs him is as little affrighted with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
as with the cryes and reproaches which follow her.
Fierceness is beautifull, and boldness pleasing on her Face.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55122:95"/>
There is something, I know not what, that is Noble and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesticall
about her, which resembles Soveraignty. And were
she armed, one would imagine that it vvere Victory her self
which abandons the <hi>Tuscans,</hi> and is going to render her self to
the <hi>Romans.</hi> Her Companions follow her vvith a bold and
resolute cheerfulness: The vveakest are mounted two by
two upon their Horse; the rest hold by their Tayles, and
swim the best they are able. They have all an equall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and the fire vvhich issues forth of their eyes, and
addes something, I know not vvhat, of splendor to the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their looks, clearly shews that they are very pure <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
vvomen, and that their hearts are full of the blood and
spirit of the Republike. The vvaves becomming smooth
under their bodies, carry them vvith respect and delight. It
seems that some Soveraign <hi>Genius,</hi> and full of Authority is
come opportunely to keep them in awe: And if some of
them rise above the rest, they do it vvith so much modesty, as
gives occasion to believe, that it is only to applaud this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
and to testifie their joy.</p>
               <p>The God of the River comes forth in person to be a specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and to partake of the hopes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the presage
of her Victories. Behold him Crowned vvith branches of
Corrail, and Encompassed with Reeds, vvho expresses his
astonishment by his action. Tears of joy trickle down from
his eyes, vvhich are mingled vvith the vvater vvhich fals
from his Hair and Beard. <hi>Horacius</hi> vvas lately received by
him vvith less gladness, when he cast himself between his
Arms after the fall of the Pridge, vvhich had been so brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and couragiously defended by him. And his hands lifted
up to Heaven, seem to thank the Gods for having allyed him
to a Republike, whose Daughters triumph over Kings, and
know how to vanquish Armies without fighting.</p>

                  <p>THis generous Maid, who rather affected an honorable and perilous
Freedom then a subjected &amp; captivated Security, is to chaste Women
a great Mistress of Honor and Christian Liberty. She teacheth them
gallantly &amp; like a Roman, the very same which St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth in so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
a Latine stile. She tells them that Chastity is not servile, and cannot be
made a Captive; that it cannot endure chains; no not those which adorn
and beautifie; that it is an enemy to all sorts of Prisons, even glorious
and magnificent ones, even those which are built for riot and pleasure.
This free and generous Chastity did not invent the Neck-laces, Bracelets,
and other ensignes of this pretious and specious servitude which Women
have made for themselves. And when they are imposed on them by a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Power, and the tyrannie of Custom, so far is Chastity from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
or beautifying and adorning her self therewith, that she wears
them with regret and pain; and groans under chains of gold and pearl,
as <hi>Hester</hi> did under the yoke of her Diadem.</p>
                  <p>But if she cannot endure these jewels which adorn the body, much less
can she bear with those which afflict the minde; which are the yoke and
torment of the heart, which bind the thoughts and inchain desires; which
make of a poor soul a voluntary and obstinate Captive. Likewise there is
no servitude more aver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a woman to be held by that, and remain chaste: And how strong soever a
place may be, yet it is taken when Hostages are once given. Besides, it is
observable in this History, that the generosity of <hi>Claelia</hi> effected more alone
then all the heads of the Senate, and all the arms of the Camp: And that
which is very strange, a vertuous Woman and a bold Maid were the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
of the Republick, and the principal causes of the Roman Liberty. A
more famous proof cannot be brought, concerning the utility of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

                  <p>THis Question is not one of those extravagant Problems and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes
which are made at random, and without any appearance of
doubt. On what side soever you take it, there is a probability,
and evident and colourable Reasons for it: And the vertue of <hi>Claelia,</hi> which
was no less profitable, nor less esteemed at <hi>Rome</hi> then that of <hi>Horatius</hi> and
<hi>Scerola,</hi> doth clear it at least of Temerity. However my intention is not to
decide it. It will suffice that I set down plainly and sincerely the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and right of the Parties. The Readers will deliver their opinion
how they please, concerning my Relation: If there be injustice in their
Censures, this injustice will neither prove Murther nor Theft: and after
this, there will remain neither any death for them to expiate, nor any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution

                  <p>Let us begin with our own Vertue which is the eldest, and will have
the first place; and let us forget nothing which may support her Right,
and set a value upon her Advantages. First the Vertue of Men is a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Command and Authority, a superintendent and directing Vertue.
She is for that side which governs and directs: And it is as well a part of
her Duty as of her Right to govern and conduct. For this reason, as in a
humane Body the Head is of more use then the Arms, and Discourse then
Motion: As the Art of a Pilot is more necessary and useful in a Ship then
the skill of the Marriners: As the valour of a Commander in chief, nay
an infirm and weak Commander, is more important in an Army, and
contributes more to Victory then the valour of Souldiers who are in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
health (which hath caused this saying, That Stags which should
have a Lyon for their Captain, might overcome Lyons which should be
led by a Stag.) So in a Common-wealth, the vertue of Men which is on

                     </gap>n, and hath only by natural Right a docility, subjection
and obedience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What is said of Good, is to be said of Vertue. That Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
which is the most common, and whose limits are least restrained, which
acts the most universally and in more then in one place; which extends
it self to more subjects, to more uses, and to a larger space, ought to be
without doubt the most beneficial to the Publick; as it is in its self the
most perfect, and in its Stock and Natural Goods. Now the vertue of a
Man is dispersed through the whole Body of the Common-wealth: It
act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s in all the parts thereof, and gives to every one that life and motion
which is proper to it. All Civil Functions appertain to it, All Military offices
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55122:98"/>
enter into its Duty: Churches and Tribunals, City and Country, the
Court and Desert are under its jurisdiction; and consequently for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
it cannot be disputed in point of utility with the vertue of a
Woman, which is a particular and quiet vertue, a restrain'd and sedentary
vertue; a Vertue which scarce goes abroad without staining its self, or at
least without blushing, which can no further inlarge its self then the
length of the silken and woolen tyes, wherewith it is fastened to
its home.</p>
                  <p>In fine, Vertue is more profitable where it is most active; It is most
active where it is most vigorous: And doubtless it must be more vigorous
in subjects naturally solid and fortified by use, then in weak and slothful
ones, where it is weak and remiss. It is then more vigorous and active,
and consequently of greater utility in a man who is of a stronger and
more solid complexion then a Woman; and who hath more vigour, more
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>dness, more constancy, and more natural stability. And this Reason
added to the two former, seems to conclude for us, and to give the prize
to the vertue of our Sex.</p>
                  <p>However the vertue of Women hath likewise its right and pretentions:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> grounded upon Reasons and Examples: It can alledge for its self Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

                     </gap>: And if we give credit thereto, it wants but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

valent of Spirit and Language, wherewith combats are sought in the long
Robe; yet I will adventure to say something in its behalf. And if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
Military Orders have been instituted to defend it with Arms, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that without deserting the cause, one may at present defend it
with the Pen.</p>
                  <p>To begin then by giving an Answer to the Reasons of the adverse
pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>y, I say, It is certain that Publick Good is rather a work of Vertue
which commands and governs, then of that which obeys and is governed.
But it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> certain, whether this commanding and ruling Vertue be

                  </p>
                  <p>As for what hath been said, that the most diffused Vertue, and the
most universal in its actions, is the most beneficial to the Publick; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55122:98"/>
that it hath been spoken judiciously and with reason: But the Vertue
of Women hath been wrongfully and injuriously represented as an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Captive, to whom its house was given for a Prison, and was bound
with tyes of thred and couen. I know not whether the use and custom of
this Age have not in this point offered violence to Nature: But I know
very well that there was a time when it was more free: and that the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Women, less restrained then now it is, served more profitably in
all the parts of the Rebulick. The Jews had Women Generals of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and Women Judges and Prophetesses: Women have publickly
taught Philosophy and Rhetorick at <hi>Athens:</hi> A Woman succeeded in the
School and reputation of <hi>Plo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> have had women Graduats and Readers: And to say nothing
of those whom Orators, Poets, and Painters have had for their Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and Rivals, there is scarce any Nation which hath not furnished Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
with Heroesses and Amazons.</p>
                  <p>It hath been said in the third place that Vertue is more active, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
more beneficial in a strong subject wherein it is vigorous, then in
a weak one wherein it is remiss. This Proposition being understood of the
vigorous operation of the soul, contributes nothing to a Man, not takes
nothing from a Woman. Their souls are essentially equal and of the same
temper: There are some Men indeed in whom Wit and Courage, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and Resolution (which are the Nerves and Muscles of the Soul)
have less hold and vigour, then in many Women. And that if the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
be understood of the strength of the Body, and the solidity of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is from our purpose, and carries besides our Level. Vertue is not of
so low a degree: It hath not been given us to bear great burthens, and to
hew down Trees: And the Moral hath not placed amongst the qualities
of a good Magistrate, and the conditions of a perfect Prince, the strength
of the arms, and the breadth of the shoulders.</p>
                  <p>From this consideration then, the equality is at least seeming between
the vertue of a Man, and that of a Woman. And some person who would
not rest satisfied with having reconciled the parties, and reduced their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
to equality, might adde over and above to the right of Women a
new weight of Reasons, which would carry it against the right of Men.
First he might say, that the particular disposition of Families and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
themselves, resemble particular States, and abbreviated Kingdoms, in
which Women Reign. If they be Wise, Vertue and Peace Reign there
joyntlie with them: And from this Peace of well ordered Houses, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
tranquillity, and good order of Cities ariseth.</p>
                  <p>Unto that, he might adde that the matter and first seed of mens Vertues
comes from a good birth, and is form'd by good Education: And that
the Vertue of Women contributes much to a good Birth, and doth all in
matter of good Education. It doth not import that Man should be the first
Principal or Original of Man, and that a Woman should be but the second
and subaltern. Thus is the Sun the first Producer of Trees and Mettals,
and yet Trees are good or bad according to the disposition of the Earth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55122:99"/>
which is their common Mother: And under one Sun Gold and Palm-Trees
are produced in one place; and elswhere nothing but clay and
thornes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is the same with men; if there be of them Intellectual and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
Couragious and Faint hearted, Modest and Insolent, all these good
and bad qualities derive from the Vertues or Vices of their Mothers. They
take in their wombs by track of time, and drop by drop the different
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and several tinctures of good and evil, sleep'd in their blood and
mingled with their humors: as Potters Clay receives a good or bad shape
from the Mould in which its Cast.</p>
                  <p>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> very well what de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>terous and careful Tutors are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and what is done in Colledges and Academies. But surely what
address soever these Tutors have, and what Care so ever they imploy, yet
they change not the matter which they work upon. Iron becomes
not gold in the hands of the Goldsmith. Nor is Earth converted into
Marble under the hands of the Engraver. Precious matters ought to come
from the Quarry and Mine: And Noble Subjects and capable of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
formes, are to be composed in the Mothers womb. I speak nothing
of Education, which is a painful generation and of long labor, and a
Birth of many years It is certain that this Education is effected by the cares
and hands of Women And if children be like shape-less lumps, to which
it is necessary that the tongues of Mothers should give the right form; it
cannot be doubted but these tongues give them also the tincture, either of
vertue or vice, according to the good or evil qualities wherewith they
are indued.</p>
                  <p>In fine, one might alledge for the last proof of this Discourse, that
the vertue of Women is more efficacious then ours; and that our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
are not so much followed nor run after in such throngs as theirs;
whether by reason Meekness is more attractive and perswasive then Force,
and that pleasing Originals never want Coppiers: Whether by reason
guides of this Nature take away all excuses from the Faint-hearted and
Tamerous: and that there is no Person who dares complain of the
thornes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ggedness of the way in their Company: Whether by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
all men being either Sons of Husbands to some Women, the Sons
follow by instinct, of out of respect the wills of their Mothers; and the
Husbands accommodate themselves out of friendship or complacencie to
the inclinations of their Wives. And for these reasons the vertue of Women
being generally followed, and having Imitators in both Sexes, it seems
one may conclude, that their Sex is more profitable, and more conducing
to the Publick Good.</p>

And this zeal was so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>These actions did not proceed from an unprofitable and idle Vertue:

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE defeat of <hi>Brutus</hi> could not be concealed
from <hi>Porcia.</hi> The noise and mourning for it
are great everywhere: The Publik as well as
Particulars regret it equally and in common:
and I believe that the very <hi>Statues</hi> in the <hi>Senate</hi>
and <hi>Tribune</hi> have lamented a Citizen with whom in fine the
Republike and Liberty of <hi>Rome</hi> even then expired. This
generous woman did not receive this loss with outcryes
and fainting fits; she did not violate her Cheeks and Hair;
she did not accuse Heaven, nor reproach Fortune for it;
and one may say that the news of <hi>Brutus</hi> Death found <hi>Brutus</hi>
living and victorious in <hi>Porcia.</hi> Nevertheless, with all this
Fortitude and Courage, she took a resolution to die: and
you need not doubt but she will execute the resolution she
hath taken.</p>
               <p>Nothing of Cowardize ought to be expected from the
Daughter of <hi>Cato;</hi> nothing of weakness from the widdow of
<hi>Brutus.</hi> She is couragious from her Race, and a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
by Alliance: and her Death will be as Stoicall as that
of her Husband and Father: Her kindred and friends being
willing to preserve this fair remainder of the ancient Vertue,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55122:103"/>
did in vain set guards upon her: she made them understand
that they might inchain her body, but could never fetter her
soul: That she could pass through a thousand Chains, and
as many closed Gates: and that if her Fathers Vertue was
able to free him from the power of <hi>Caesar;</hi> and that of her
Husband, to preserve himself from the victory of <hi>Anthony;</hi>
Hers would not remain captive to their importune cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and troublesome offices. In fine, whether she had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
or prevailed with them, you see her out of their
hands: And how little soever their cares are retarded, it is
much to be feared they will come too late, and not finde her
alive.</p>
               <p>A slave who had broken his Chains, and freed himself
from a long imprisonment, could not be more joyfull then
you behold her. Her joy notwithstanding is modest and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere:
As her heart never changes place, so her face never
alters colour: and her Death from this very instant will be
as quiet and serene, as her Contentments were heretofore.
She represents not to her self the place to which she goeth,
nor the way she takes. She hath nothing but <hi>Brutus</hi> in her
thoughts, and before her eyes, and provided she go to him, it
is indifferent to her whither she go by Sword, Precipice, or
Poyson. The shortest way is the best in her opinion: and
the nearest Gate, what spectre or terrifying object soever hath
the guard of it, will be fitter for her purpose then one more
free and remote.</p>
               <p>But all wayes appear to her equally barred up, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of her servants removed from about her, all that
could open any passage unto death. She pretends that this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is a violence offered her, she is vexed and angry at it;
yet this vexation is without trouble, and this anger ascends
not to her face. All her thoughts are busied to deceive these
officious Importunes, and not to take revenge of them. There
are no offensive arms which she doth not try upon her self in
imagination. Her Fancy puts into her mouth, and to her
throat all it can compound of Poysons, or forge into Swords.
She attempts to strangle her self with the Scarf you see in he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55122:103"/>
hand: she tryed in vain to do it with her Neck-lace and
one of her Bracelets: And nothing remains but to tear off
her Hair, and work it into a Cord. Surely to commit a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with such instruments, is to inrage Beauty, and render
the Graces cruel. But all means of getting out of prison
seems lawfull and honest to a Captive.</p>
               <p>VVith this thought she entred into her Closet; she found
an opportunity to dye more couragiously, and without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nnocent things. She found there a pan of Coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
which little <hi>Cupids,</hi> the Authors of fair Couples, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents
of vertuous Amities have prepared for the ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of
her affection. I doubt not but she sees them by the light of
the fire within her Soul, which is mingled with that of their
Torches. And you may behold them as well as she, if your
eyes were purified from the vapors which arise from Matter:
The two least present to her the pan of Coals, which they
carry upon their heads. They render her this last office,
with smiles and serene countenances: You would say that
they animate her with their sparkling eyes, and with the joy
of their looks; and that their mouthes half open, seem to
promise her the acclamations of Fame, and the applauses of
all Ages. A third <hi>Cupid,</hi> greater and stronger then the two
other, and hanging in the ayre, lights with his Torch the
Coals which are in the Pan: I believe notwithstanding that
his Torch, what vertue soever it hath, contributes less there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
then his presence. And if some one might say, that by
only touching a Tree with the end of his Finger, he cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d set
a whole Forrest on fire; it is apparent that this <hi>Cupid</hi> might
in passing by, and with his bare shadow infire Mountains,
even frozen Mountains, and covered over with Snow.</p>
               <p>Do you not observe upon the face of <hi>Porcia</hi> the pleasing
mixture which proceeds from the light of this Torch, added
to the fire of her eyes, and that which her heart spreads upon
her Cheeks? There truly it is where confusion appears no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and where delight and glory enters. Painters and Dyers
could invent nothing like this. And the concurrence is not
so lovely upon a Rose freshly blown, when the first rayes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55122:104"/>
of the day newly flaming, and still red from its birth, adds an
artificial Purple to that which is natural to it. You have a
sight piercing enough to sever the brightness of the fire from
the fair dye of blood, and to distinguish the lustre which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
outward, from that which Courage begets, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
from the bottom of the Soul.</p>
               <p>But you are too attentive in contemplating the action of
<hi>Porcia:</hi> And her heart is more visible by that then her face.
VVith one hand she puts a burning Coal into her mouth;
with the other she takes a second, as if she needed many to
conclude her life: And whether the grief for her loss hath
suppressed all other sorrows; whether she hath no sence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
but in her heart, where her soul contracts it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Image of <hi>Brutus;</hi> you would say that they are Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies
which she handles; you would say that they are Leaves
of Roses which she swallows. But whether it be insensibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or resolution, whether it be Love or Philosophy, it doth
not hinder the fire she had within, fortified with an exteriour
flame, from burning the tyes of her soul.</p>
               <p>I conceive them already consumed, and this generous soul
speedily departing out of her fair prison, will joyn it self
with her likeness which is come to receive it. Her Guards
affrighted and surprized, hasten with tears in their eyes, and
complaints in their mouthes. But their tears will not quench
this fire, nor will their complaints terrifie Death, or chase it
away from the place into which it is entred. This fire will
shine in the eyes of all Nations and Ages, and give an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
lustre to the memory of <hi>Porcia:</hi> This Death will be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld
with that of <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Brutus:</hi> And this Closet will
be as fair a Perspective in History as the City of <hi>Vtica,</hi> and
the <hi>Philippian</hi> Field.</p>

reverence to it to the last; and honoured it with her last words. Seeing
her self besieged by her kindred, which took from her all means of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
asunder the tyes of her soul, she resolved to kindle there a fire with
burning Coals, which she swallowed down. Thus she set at liberty what
remained of her Father and Husband: And by her death the blood of the
one, and the heart of the other, once more overcame Tyrannie.</p>

                  <p>WOmen ought to learn from this example, that the fault cannot be
charged upon their Sex that they are not valiant: That their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
are vices of Custom, and not any defect of Nature:
And that a great heart is no more discomposed by a tender body, then is a
great Intelligence by a beautiful Planet. Doves would have the boldness

that they ought to have a place for them as well in their Closets as Beds;

                  <head type="sub">VVhether VVomen be capable of an Eminent Generosity?</head>
                  <p>I Have been present at some Disputes undertaken upon this Question:
And sometimes it hath caused me to have innocent and pleasing quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
with my Friends. I have seen some who could not endure that a
Woman should be commended for Generosity: It is, said they, as if one
should praise her for having a good seat on horse-back, and for well
handling her Arms: It is as if one would set her forth with a Helmet or
the skin of a Lion: It were to confound the bounds which sever us, and
place disorder in Morality. And a generous Woman is no less a Solecism
then a Woman Doctor, and a Woman Cavalier. It is an incongruity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as undecent as a bearded Woman.</p>
                  <p>To this I did Answer, that Vertues having their seat in the Soul, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only a good disposition of the Soul to operate, belong to both Sexes;
That Generosity is one of those Vertues: That the office of the Body and
the action of its Members are not necessary to it; That all its Functions
are interiour and performed in the heart: And that the heart of Man and
Woman is of the same Matter and Form. I added thereunto, that the
Comparison of Arms and Military Exercises concluded nothing against
the Generosity of Women: That all things are becoming to well-shaped
persons and of a handsom aspect: That <hi>Semiram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

were as gracefully set forth with Helmets as with Crowns: And that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as well known in Fables, was not found unhandsom in the Lions
skin, which <hi>Hercules</hi> wore. That besides that, there have been women seen
who knew how to manage a horse, to throw a dart, &amp; use their swords with
a good grace. No just comparison can be made, nor a right consequence
drawn from the exercises of the Body in reference to the Habits of the
Soul. That a Woman Doctor and a Woman Cavalier were but Errors of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55122:106"/>
Grammar which do not violate Morality. That Generosity not being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
to the heart of a man as a beard is to his face, it might belong with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any incongruity or undecency to both Sexes.</p>
                  <p>To these Reasons which came to my minde, and which I alledged tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary
and without choice in like Disputes, others of more weight and
better prepared may be added upon meditation. Generosity, to define it
rightly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a heighth of courage, or an Elevation of minde, whereby a soul
raised above interest and profit, is led inviolably and without deviation
unto Duty which is labourious, and to Gallantry which is painful and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
in appearance. And because this disposition taken in its usual foyle, and
in respect of matter, scarce belongs to any but Great and Noble Persons:
the name of Generosity hath been given to it, which is a name of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Nobility. Whether then that we take Generosity materially, and
for that cream of good blood and pure Spirits which nourish and sustain
it: Whether we take it Morally for an immutable and constant resolution
to pursue Duty and Gallantry, even to the contempt of Interest, and with
the loss of benefit, it will appear that in either sense, Women are no less
capable thereof then Men.</p>
                  <p>First, it was never said, that Nobility appertained only to one Sex, and
that the cream of good blood was all on the one side, &amp; all the dregs on the
other. The distribution of it is equally made, and according to natural
Justice. Sisters possess it in common and without distinction with their
Brothers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it is with noble Races as with Pomegranate Trees, which
bare no Flowers without Purple, nor Fruit without Crowns: And it is
the like with Palm Trees, whole Males and Females are of equal Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Wherefore a noble minde belonging no less to Women then Men,
and the pure blood dispersing its self equally through the veins from their
Birth: it remains that Generosity should have on either part an equal
stock, and that the matter of which it is composed should be common.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The true form and proper spirit of Generosity proceeds
from the Intention, and pursuit of that pure and laborious Good which
is its object And this object is not so difficult, nor placed in so high a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
as women cannot pretend to it. They are not so meanly born that
they cannot raise themselves above what is pleasing and profitable: they
may have higher a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ms and more noble desires; Nature hath given them as
well as to us, the rellish and appetite of acting gallantly: And in History
the foot-steps remain still fresh, of those who have arrived to this vertue
through thorny passages and precipices, even through flames and tortures.
The frequent toyls they have undergone to run after a luminous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
Fantome, testifie their disposition and forces, shewing what they
are able to do herein. and when Queens and Princesses shall be exposed,
who have cast themselves from their Thrones, who have mounted upon
flaming Piles, who have passed through Swords, to follow a seeming
and imaginary Good, who will be so incredulous and obstinate as to deny
that Women have a Natural inclination to an effective and real Good?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as Princes and great Persons have their Duties and a Gallantry
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55122:106"/>
which is proper to their Fortunes: So Princesses and great Ladies, besides
the Duties and Gallantry of their Sex, have second Duties, and a particular
Gallantry, which appertains to the Decency of their condition. Now if
these Duties be laborious, if this Gallantry be difficult and environed with
dangers; if one cannot arrive to it but with trouble and ruines? If to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to it one must abandon certain Interest, and ruine a present Fortune? If
one must part with his blood, and expose his life, what will a Couragious
Woman and of qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ty do, and to what side will she betake her self? Can
any one wish that she should submit to fear and conjectures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That she
should expose her honour to preserve her Fortunes? That she should fail
in her Duty, not to prejudice her estate? That she should suffer her blood
to be stained, rather then part with one drop of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This truly would be
very poor, and unworthy of a Noble Soul. She must then renounce the
pleasure and profit; she must trample upon the Mines of her Interests:
she must renounce Fortune, and reject her Parents; she must expose her
self even to death and punishments, to advance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
to Duty.</p>
                  <p>Since this cannot be effected without an Heroick Generosity, one must
of necessity either grant this Generosity to Women, or allow that they may
be Covetous and Interessed out of Duty; that they be lazy and disloyal,
handsomly and with decency, ungrateful and treacherous by the right of
Nature, and the priviledge of their Sex.</p>
                  <p>But Nature hath not conferred on them so bad a Right, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Priviledge. On the contrary, she would have them all born with
an inclination to what is glorious: And whether she hath infused some
Ray into their souls; or whether their hearts in their very Birth have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in Impression of it, like to that which Iron receives from the
Load stone: the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is found: And their souls at the first Idea, which excite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they have received of it, turn to it by their own instinct, and without ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>pecting
any extrinsical motion which presseth them to it. From thence it
comes that Women are generally curious in what is fair and glorious, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
seeking after all the Species of it, and observing all the Rules and
Formes thereof. And if upon their Bodies, and in their Garments, in
their Moveables, and all things else they so pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ionatly affect, a materiall
and sensible Beauty, which is of the lowest Order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not credible, that
they have less inclination to the Intellectual Beauty; and of the first Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which is the Beauty of what is Noble and Gallant. From hence we may
conclude regularly, and in good form, that the inclination to this Splendo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
being, as truly it is, the Fountain of true Generosity, one cannot deprive
them of it without taking from them thereby that inclination which is
most Natural to them; it being the second spirit of their hearts, and the
first property of their Sex.</p>
                  <p>But why should we take it from them? Hath Nature made them les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Noble then the Females of other Animals, to whom she hath given ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of Generosity, which she hath not bestowed on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55122:107"/>
not whether any man hath made this observation before me; yet it ought
to be made, and Women may draw instruction, and advantage from
thence. Lions and Tygers, Leopards, Male-Eagles, and all other beasts
which are naturally so fierce and couragious, never fight but for Interest,
and Prey: And their whole Courage, to express it well, is but a violen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
greediness; Their Valour is but for necessity and Rapine: Hunger is the
only Punctilio of Honour which sets them on, and without this provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
their fierceness pines away, and their mettal grows dull. It is not the
same with Females, their mettal is more Noble, and their valour less In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested.
They fight not only for their proper necessities, and do it as cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously
as the Males: But they fight also for others wants, for the defence
and preservation of their young ones, which the Males use not to do; even
to that heighth, that they expose themselves to fire and sword for this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is the only Duty and Good they are capable of. Hath Nature
then given Generosity to Lions and Eagles, hath she given it to Turtles and
Doves, and shall it not be in her power to give it to Women, to whom
she hath given a Soul of the same form, a Heart of the same temper. Blood
and Spirits of the same tincture as she hath given to Men? Let us conceive

Servant, a Couragious Husband, and undaunted Father. His Answer was,
<q>That he had never known other Interest to preserve, then his Honour;
not pretended to any other Fortune, then the discharge of his Duty:
That Governments &amp; Pensions were too weak Arms to vanquish him.
That an innocent and unspotted Poverty would be more glorious to
him, and give him better content, then criminal and sullyed Riches:
That the death of his Wife and Children, which they placed before his
eyes, was a Fantome which did no wayes affright him: that he owed
much to his own Blood and Nature, but far more to his Loyalty and
Prince. That his Reputation was never to him then his Family, and
his Conscience more interiour, and of an older date then his Posterity:
That a fit of the Cholick might to morrow take away his Wife, that
his Children might be as soon hurryed away by a Feaver; and that it
should not be said, that to reserve his Wife for the Cholick, and his
Children for a Feaver, he had robbed his Prince of his Right, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of Repose, his Name and Race of their Honours.</q>

was prepared for all the sad events which so dismal a beginning might
produce <q>They acquainted her that her Husband was their Prisoner:
That after his lost Liberty, he was still in the Eve of loosing his life:
that both nevertheless depended on her: That an easie ransom should
be set upon him: And that without alienating his Lands, without empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Coffers or pawning his Jewels; in a word, he should be restored
to her for the bare keys of <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Lady was of a Family which a Canonized Saint, and a Pope

                        </gap>,</hi> she came to be allyed to <hi>Vrban</hi> the fift. Besides this Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
Sanctity, and belonging to her Family, she had much Piety of her
own, and was very vertuous by her own Acquisitions. Her Piety never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
was not tepide and timerous: her Vertues were none of those idle
and Antick ones, which amuse the most part of Women. They were
strong and couragious; they acted continually and with vigour; and this
vigour was supported by a Generosity which might make a life Heroick, if
it had been placed in another Sex, and in a Soveraign Condition.</p>
                  <p>She needed no less courage to resist the Assault, and to acquit her self
with honour of so perilous an Attempt which was made upon her. She
made answer to those that proposed to her an exchange of <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cate,</hi> and her
Loyaltie for her husband: <q>That she owed her first and highest affections
to her King and Fidelity: And that she would not take them off to
give them to her husband, to whom she owed but second and inferiour
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55122:108"/>
ones. That she loved him intirely, and had great tenderness for him,
yet loved him in his degree and with order, and that there was nothing
remiss or weak in her tenderness. That she understood better then any
body the worth of her Husband: That were he to be sold innocently, and
to be put to a Lawful ransom, she would not only alienate her Lands and
pawn her Jewels to redeem him, but even rent out the labour of her
hands, and make money of her blood and death, if she could compass
it by her sweat and pains. That nevertheless for this, she would never
alienate her Fidelity, nor engage therein one single point of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
And that if she should make so ill a bargain, her husband
would be the first breaker of it. That he would never be perswaded to
depart out of Prison without his honour; nay he would never descend
from a Scaffold, nor ascend unto a Throne without it. But should he
forget his honour (went she on) yet I will never be unmindfull of
mine: I know too well the value of it, nor will I ever dispossess my
self thereof for any gain or loss which may arise from it. I understand
very well to what Marriage obligeth me; and what I owe to my Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
But I was not born a marryed Person, as I am born a French-Woman.
And it shall never be said that to preserve a Family, which
was but yesterday, and peradventure will not be to morrow, I have
laid open a Fort to Rebellion, and contributed to the ruine of my
Countrey.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Confederates of the League being overcome and repulsed at
this first Assault, did not yet retire: they continued the Battery for
the space of seven weeks: And every day they gave some new onset
upon the Place, through the heart of this generous Woman. Sometimes
they sware to make her Husband suffer all sorts of torments: And they
made her endure them all in her imagination with terrifying looks, and
far more frightfull words. Sometimes they threatned to render him back
to her by piece-meal: And these threats were worse then Canon shots, or
Granadoes, but they fell upon a heart which was stronger then the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Bulwarks; and which would not have yielded either for Canon shot,
or for all their Granadoes. In fine, the Confederates of the League despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of taking <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cate</hi> by so well guarded a place: and the dolefull and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
execution which followed their despair, clearly shewed that they
spake in good earnest; and that their threats were reall. Monsieur <hi>de
Barry</hi> was strangled in his Chamber by the hand of an Executioner: And
neither the Cord nor Engine wherewith he was strangled, could not draw
from his mouth any sign of irresolution, nor one single word of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
In History there are more glorious and famous Deaths then this;
but a more magnanimous &amp; heroick one hath not been seen. Remarkable
Deaths are not made so, by the Grandeur of the Armes which destroy; they
arise from the greatness of Courage, and the force of resolution: and there
are enough which will not yield before two hundred Piles, and a battery
of twelve Canon. But there are few which render not themselves to the
Rope of an Executioner. Surely it were to be wished, for the good of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55122:109"/>
State, that we might have many Copies of this gallant Man, and of this
generous Woman: If there were but one in every Town of the Kingdom,
it would be at least impregnable through coveteousness or fear.</p>
                  <p>The sending back the body of Monsieur <hi>de Barry,</hi> did in a strange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
incense the Garrison. In the first heat of anger and compassion, the
Soldiers transported by both, ran unto the Governors house, with a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

kept him Prisoner, being advertised of the taking of Monsieur <hi>de Barry,</hi>
had given him in charge to his wife, that he might be responsible to her
for the life of her husband; and that by the right of Reprisals he might
make satisfaction with his own life if the other miscarryed. Doubtless
there had been an end of him, and all the credit of the League could not
have saved him in this tumult, if Madam <hi>de Barry</hi> had not been more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
and humane then is observed in the single order of Nature. But
she was so after a more pure and sublime manner: and there was in her
heart another kind of spirit, and other principles, differing from the spirit
of the world, and the Maximes of Morality. <q>She presented her self before
this irritated Troop, and spake so efficaciously, and with so powerfull
and perswasive a grace of Monsieur <hi>de Loupians</hi> Innocence, of the Crime
they would commit, in making him undergo the penalty of a murther,
whereof he was not guilty; of the punishment God would infallibly
inflict upon this offence; that she appeased their spirits, and removed
all spite and rage from their grief. Addressing her self afterwards to her

the Heroick constancy, and the inviolable Fidelity of his Father; The
Patrimony of Glory which his death had purchased to their Family;
the stain which the unjustly spilt blood of Monsieur <hi>de Loupian</hi> would
bring upon this still-fresh Glory: the repentance which follows pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
Anger and unlawful Revenges: The Protection they ought to
expect from him, who makes himself to be called the Father of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,
and the Defender of Widows.</q> And by these reasons, fortifyed
by her example, and animated by a spirit of Vertue and Authority, she
saved this poor Gentleman, and sent him back to Monsieur <hi>Mont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The History of <hi>Spain</hi> makes a great deal of noise about the Generosity
of <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>an</hi> the Good, who being summoned by the Moors either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
up <hi>Terissa,</hi> which he defended, or to be a Spectator of his Sons death,
who was a Prisoner in their hands, would not become a Traitor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
a Father, and chose rather to preserve his Honour then his Race.
Truly this Generosity was Heroick: And <hi>Spain,</hi> so magnificent in great
words, and in vast and high expressions, hath no words so great, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
so vast which can equal it. Nevertheless the action of a Woman,
and a French Woman hath surpassed it: And the Loyaltie of Madam <hi>de
Barry</hi> was so much the more Gallant and Generous then that of <hi>Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>man,</hi> in
as much as a dearer pledge, and a more irreparable and sensible loss was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55122:109"/>
to be hazarded thereby. The Spaniard consented to the loss of a young
Plant which was dear to him, and made one part of himself: But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
this young plant was not single: This part was served from him;
And besides others might grow up in its place. The <hi>French</hi> Woman came
not off at so cheap a rate; she was to undergo the loss of the Stem, and
of all the Roots. She was to suffer the Incision of a part which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in her; which stuck to her flesh and bones, which was flesh of
her flesh, and bone of her bone, which made up the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty of her heart
and spirit. And the chiefest matter is, that this so difficult and costly fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was exercised in a time of trouble and tumult; In a time when Laws
were in disorder, and Duties in confusion: when Rebellion was Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
by the People, and Loyaltie made an Hackny: when Soveraignty
was L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tigious, and brought into Dispute, when the oppressed Crown
seemed ready to be torn in pieces, or to change its Master.</p>
                  <p>The Command of <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cate</hi> continued to this generous Widow: And for
the space of seven years she performed the Functions of it with so much
courage, and with so laborious an Assiduity, as she left nothing more to
be desired in point of her care and conduct. By her presence she gave
incouragement to the labours and exercises of the Souldiers: She was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in their Duties, and kept them in an exact Order, and under a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Discipline: She Commanded pleasingly, and with Dignity; and she
her self added example, and the shew of action to her Commands: And
whatsoever an active and vigilant Captain, Armed with Authority, could
have done in a Garrison Town, this gallant Woman did it generously and
with success, she did it with comeliness and a pleasing grace.</p>
                  <p>The deceased King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, who esteemed nothing rashly
and out of fancy, highly prized this Generosity: And when some Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers

                        </gap>cate,</hi> represented to him, that a Place
of such importance was not safe in the hands of a Woman: He often An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<q>That he reposed more Trust in this Woman, then in the ablest
Man of his Kingdom: That he knew not any one, who could give
so gallant an Earnest, or so precious a Pledge of their Fidelity, as she
had done: And that above all, it concerned the honour of <hi>France,</hi> to
have it known, that there were Ladies of that Nation, not inferiour to
Captains.</q> Nothing could be added to these few words: They spake
more then our longest Elogies can do. They Crown the Memory of this
Generous Woman, and are a greater Honour to her then a triumphant
Arch, and many Statues.</p>

               <p>To the force of so many Heroick reasons, and of so many

which is far more Heroick and Magnanimous. And the
mortall stroke she but even now gave her self, set a value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Reasons, and fortified them by a present Authority,
and by a Personall and still-fresh Experiment. She exhorts
him with her eyes, and countenance as you see: she exhorts
him with her hand, with which she presents him a Dagger.
But her most efficacious and pressing Exhortation is that of
her wound, which is a mouth of good credit and belief; a
mouth which can only say what it thinks, and nothing which
it doth not perswade. This stream of blood which flows
from thence, hath her voice and spirit: and this spent all

draw near their end. For my part I believe, and believe it

know no other Garlands but Helmets, no other Posies but
Swords, of those which take delight in Frost and Rain</p>
               <p>, in
Chains and Prisons. And I am much mistaken if it be not
the very same Love which led <hi>Euadne</hi> to the flaming pile of
her Husband, which sparkled the Sword wherewith the true
<hi>Dido</hi> guarded her self from a second Marriage: and which
lately also cut off the Hair of the Vertuous <hi>Hypsicratea,</hi> put
the Helmet on her head, and made a Queen become a Foot-soldier
in the Army of <hi>Mithridates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At present this Love playes the Exhorter and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
it speaks to <hi>Cicinna</hi> of liberty and glory, and animates
him to follow the Example and Courage of his wife. You
would say, that in guiding his hand to the Dagger which is
offered him, she assures him, that it will cut off the ligaments
of his soul without hurting him; that it hath been mollified
in the bosome of <hi>Arria,</hi> and by the fire of her heart; that
her blood hath qualified it, and take from thence all that it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55122:112"/>
had of malignity and sharpness: and that not only so No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Honourable a weapon as that, but even a Cord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by the hand of so gallant a woman, would be more
glorious then many Diadems wrought by the hand of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and presented by those of <hi>Messaline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicinna</hi> seems fully perswaded by these reasons, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
them by his gesture and countenance. He is no longer
the same fearfull and irresolute man as before: He hath still
the same head and body, but another heart is placed in this
body, and another spirit in this head. He hath no longer any
blood in his veins which is not <hi>Romane:</hi> All his thoughts
are triumphant, and all his sentiments worthy of a Consul:
and shortly his soul, greater then Fortune, and stronger then
Death, will depart victorious over both, and re-unite it self
to the soul of <hi>Arria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Example of constancy and conjugall Fidelity is very
precious to <hi>Rome</hi> at this time: and no doubt but the young
<hi>Arria</hi> and <hi>Trascus</hi> her Husband, who are spectators thereof,
will make good use of it. They greedily and studiously col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the circumstances thereof, and look upon it as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
piece of their Patrimony. Truly it is wonderfull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a wisdom at the age of eighteen; to behold maturity
and youth in one and the same head. To see a woman cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
and constant; a woman grave and serious in an age
of divertisements and pleasures. She conceives her self more
rich from the lessons and examples of her mother, then from
the succession of all the Consuls of her House: and three
drops of her blood, and four syllables of her last words have
something in them which is dearer to her then all the Pearls
of her Ancestors. She likewise stores up these words, and
layes up about her heart all that she can gather of his blood,
and of the spirit which is mingled with it. Surely this must
needs be her good Genius, who inspires her so timely to arm
her self thereby: and she cannot choose but foresee the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
wherein it will be usefull to her to have conserved the
memory of her Mother, and fortified her self with her Blood
and Courage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:55122:112"/>
                  <hi>Traseus</hi> was no less solicitous to reap benefit by this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Example: The present misfortune of <hi>Cicinna</hi> is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to him of his future mishap: and not finding himself so
weak as to crouch under the age, nor so powerfull as to alter
it; he clearly sees that the least he can expect, is to be ruined by
it after the rest. He restifies at least by his countenance that he
will not fall cowardly, nor expect till they push him on:
and all the rules of Phisiognomy are deceitfull, or he will be
an Original of his time, and his death will have one day a
place amongst the Heroick Examples.</p>

and brought to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Couragious and Faithful Arria did not
deliberate, whether she ought to follow him. It came not into her thoughts
that Adversity was a Divorce: she did not believe that bad Fortune ought
to be more powerful then Love; nor that it could Lawfully dissolve
Marriages. On the contrary, she believed that she was the Wife of
<hi>Cicinna,</hi> a Criminal and Prisoner, as she had been of <hi>Cicinna</hi>'s a Favourite
and Consul; and that she ought to have as great a share in his Chains and
Punishments, as she had in his Fortunes and Glory. She accompanied
him to the Ship: And at the instant of Imbarking, seeing her self put
back by the Guards: <q>You will permit at least, saith she, that a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of an ancient Consulary Race, may have some body to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, during so long a Voyage. I alone will supply the Places
of his Attendants: And the Ship will not be the more burthened, nor
the more exposed to Tempests.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>None being able to perswade these Barbarous People to receive her all
entire, she did not forbear in spight of them, to imbark her spirit and
heart with her Husband; and that she might follow him, at least in part,
she put her Body into a Fishermans Bark, and exposed it to the Winds
and Waves which carried away the rest. Fortune favoured so couragious
a Fidelity: The Spirit and Body of <hi>Arria</hi> arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> at the same time:
And being re-united at their arrival, did joyntly and with mutual cares
sollicite the freedom of <hi>Cicinna.</hi> Her endeavours finding ill success, she
resolved to die: And she sufficiently explained her self, by the reproach
she used towards the wife of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> for surviving the death of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
slain in her bosom.</p>
                  <p>Her Son-in-Law <hi>Thrascus</hi> alledged all that he could devise to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
her to live: All that he could invent not prevailing with her:
<q>You have a mind then, saith he, that your Daughter should abandon
her self to the like despair: And you condemn her to die with me,
when Fortune shall ordain that I must perish. My Example doth not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55122:114"/>
condemn her (replyed she:) And when she shall have lived as long,
and with as sweet an harmony, as I have done with <hi>Cicinna,</hi> she may
die boldly without my coming back to take the sword out of her hand,
or the poison out of her mouth. </q>Her kindred being advertised by this
Answer, that her Resolution was of more force then their Reasons, they
renewed their cares and diligences towards her. She besought them to
suffer her quietly to die, and not to change an easie death into a painfull
one Having said this, she violently threw her self against the next Wall,
and fell into a swound. Being come again to her self with much ado:
<q>I did tell you, saith she, that all you could do, was but to hinder me
from dying quietly and at ease.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the violent Attempts which <hi>Arria</hi> made upon her soul, did not
loosen the soul of <hi>Cicinna,</hi> nor perswaded it to depart Honourably out of
the World, and without expecting the violence of his Enemies. She
went at last to see him; <q>And declared to him, that if he had not
courage enough to go first, he ought at least to have enough to follow
her. She represented to him on the one side, the shame of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
made a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Servant, who made a Scene of the Court, and a Fantome of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
On the other side she remonstrated to him the Infamy which
the Executioner left to the Ashes and Memory of those that died by his
hands. She often repeated to him, that death was only terrible to irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and timerous persons: That it doth never wound such Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Souls, as loosen voluntarily themselves, and prevent the hand of
force. That this last Act would be more looked upon in History, then
his Consulship; and would be more resplendent then the Triumphs
of his Ancestors.</q> And perceiving that he still deliberated between Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
and Fear, she plung'd a Dagger into her own bosom, which she
had provided for that purpose: And then drawing it forth warm and
dropping, she presented it to him with these words, which were the
most Heroick and Victorious that ever issued from a Romans mouth:
Take this Dagger <hi>Cicinna,</hi> it hath done me no harm. <hi>Cicinna</hi> received
from her hand, with the Weapon, the Spirit and Courage which came
forth of her wound: And died rather by the Magnanimity of <hi>Arria,</hi> then
by his own Courage.</p>

Love and conjugal Fidelity doth consist: Let them observe how
many Combats she hath fought, and how many Victories she hath
gained. She had a present and future Interest in his Possessions and Hopes.
She was Young, Rich, and the friend of <hi>Messal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

her husband to Justice, and reserved her self for a better Fortune, and a
more happy Marriage. Her Riches, her Beauty, her Youth were no
Criminals: They had not conspired against the Prince: And it was not
against them Commissioners were appointed, and Informations given.
She rejected nevertheless, the Temptations of her Age and Interest. She
listened only to her Fidelity and Love: And taught her whole Sex by her
Example, that a good Woman hath no other Interest, then her Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

deceived, who said that Marriage was but a name of pleasure: And that
even now adayes they are much mistaken, who believe it to be a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Goods and Fortunes. It is a name of Yoke and Affliction, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of Evils and Troubles; a society of Cares and Labours. And it
is fit that young Women should be advertized on the day of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that they are not to be Marryed only for that day, but for all the rest
which are to follow, how stormy soever they may prove, and what
unpleasing hours soever they may have. They ought to know, that
with the person of their Husbands, they espouse all their present and

First, If we consider the End which God proposed to himself in the
Creation of Woman; we shall finde that she was given to Man to be his
Domestique assistant, a neer Co-adjutress, and of the same Birth with
him. Now it is certain that assistances and services are not necessary for
any body in time of Prosperity. Good Fortune hath no need of comfort
or support; of having her Tears dryed up, or her Blood stanched. It is not
for her, Oyles and Balm is provided, that Plaisters and Seat clothes are
made: She hath a sound Body and a free Minde: She is equally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
from all that is Burthensom and Afflicting. It is only to
bad Fortune, Charity and Compassion, I eniti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es and Remedies are
necessary. She is always either Sick or Wounded in some part: Her eyes
are never dry; her Wounds are never closed; and at all times, she hath
need of a Preparative and Consolation, of a Physitian and Philosopher.
Women, who are Naturally Assistants to Men, and their Co-adjutresses by
Divine Institution, appertain more to their Husbands when Suffering and
Persecuted, then when Happy and in Favour. And surely their Offices
would not be very important, not their Cares very considerable and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
if they should be willing to be accommodated with their Husbands
Riches, and Illustrious with their Dignity and Glory; if they should free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offer themselves to accompany them in Purple, and under a Canopy of
State; if they should make no difficulty to share in their Feasts, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
with them the gifts of Fortune: And yet when those Feasts were
over, and another Fortune arrived; they should become Strangers in their
Houses, and to their Husbands; they should be unwilling to suffer with
them one drop of rain; they should not speak to them but at distance,
and with a scornfull gesture, as if the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight of their Husbands
portended mischief, and that even their shadow were become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious.</p>
                  <p>Let us add for a second Reason, That as at the Creation of Woman, God
considered the incommodities of Solitude, &amp; the need man had of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
and Assistant; so he considered what was wanting to his entire
Perfection, and would not that so noble a Work, and begun with so much
Art, should remain Defective, and like those rough-drawn pieces in which
there is nothing formed but the Head. He then Created Woman, and gave
her to Man, not only as an Officious and Affectionate Co-adjut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>s; but as
a second Moity, and as a necessary part to his Perfection. God having
formed and joyned together these two Pieces, he declared in express terms
that his Design was, that they should make but one Body: And it is in
this sense the words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ought to be understood, when he saith,
<hi>Man is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of the Woman.</hi> This second Reason is yet more precise and
pressing then the former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And wives thereby are more straightly obliged
to take part in either Fortune of their Husbands. And certainly if a Calm
and Tempest be common to those that sayl in the same Vessel: If all the
Persons of one house have the same days and nights and suffer joyntly all
the inequalities of Seasons: The Community doubtless ought to be more
entire, and better linked together between the parts of the same Body: and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55122:116"/>
this would be strange and seem Monstrous, if their Sentiments were not
equal, and their Compassion mutual: But it would truly exceed all that
is strange and exorbitant, if in the Compound, which is made of Wife and
Husband, whilst that part which Governs is in Mourning and Affliction,
the other which is subject should be jocund, and play the Wanton, and
would leave off nothing of her Ornaments or Pleasures: If the Body of
a Wounded and bleeding Head were delightfully adorned, covered over
with Perfumes, and loadon with Flowers: If a Wife would make one at
all Meetings of Pleasure, and take her share in all Divertisements, whilst
her Husband suffers the rack of the Sciatica, and the torture of the Stone.</p>
                  <p>One may also say, the better to establish this Duty, and perswade it more
efficaciously, that amongst all kinds of Friendships, there is not any so
straight, not better linked together then that of Marriage. It is not exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and superficial, like other Amities: Nor is it upheld like those by civil
Tyes, which are weak, and break asunder if never so little touched. It is
an Union of the whole Soul and Body; the Tyes thereof are firm and solid.
There is Nature and Grace in it: The whole Person is fastned therewith;
and Time, which wears out Brass and Steel, cannot dissolve them. Now
Friendship, as every one knows, is a Community of Sentiments, and Wills,
of Joyes and Afflictions, of good and evil Fortunes. We are further adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
by the Wife, that blessings cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> there but after evils: And that
good Fortune ought not to have any place there, but as succeeding to the
bad. Whereupon we may remember the words of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who saith, that
such Persons understand not Friendship, as seek in a Friend a merry and
Table Companion, a Solicitor of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an Agent of favour, a Mediator
of Fortune: That we must seek out a Person with whom we may cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
enter into Prison, whose Bondage and Chains we bear; A man in
whose company we suffer Shipwrack without exclaiming against the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
or complaining of the Tempest; A man for whom we endure the
Wrack without pain, for whom we die smiling and with Joy. And if
common Friendship, which is free and superficial, and supported only by
Nature, hath so painful Duties, and so heavy and hazardous burthens, what
must be the Duties and Burthens of the Friendship of Marriage, which is
so interiour and necessary, which hath the assistance of God, and the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Sacrament; which is sustained by Nature, and fortified by Grace?
Can it be either Interessed or Timerous, with any Decency? can it hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly
express a niceness can it apprehend sorrow and death? can it avoid
bad Fortune?</p>
                  <p>I might also affirm, that this Duty is reckoned amongst the comely qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of a Wife, and the honour of a Family; and that no baser perspective
can be seen in a house, then a sick and afflicted Husband, and a gossiping
and tricked up Wife. This defect wounds generally all eyes: and there are
no Pictures in <hi>Italy,</hi> not Forreign Landschaps: there are no Ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Figures can rectifie it. Honor and decency is not only concerned
therein, but even contentment and satisfaction. And as hands touch ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
a sick and wounded head, and as it is a torment to them if they be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55122:116"/>
hindred from easing its pain, and touching its wounds: so a good wife,
who hath a heart truly fixed, who is indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d and penetrated by the Grace of
the Sacrament, cannot have a purer satisfaction, then to suffer with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
And should even good Fortune her self tye her hands and feet to
detain her by force with her, and should hinder her from following her
persecuted and unfortunate husband; good Fortune would be abhorred
by her with all her kindnesses: and were her tyes made of Crowns and
Diadems, they would be unsupportable to her.</p>

Philip the Second.</head>
                  <p>THe memory of <hi>Anthony Perez</hi> ought still to be fresh at Court: We
have seen him there a long time ago in Person: And every day we
see him there in his Relations and Letters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know not whether the
name of his wife be so well known there: but I know very well that this
is the first time she appears in that place: And peradventure she would
never have come, if I had not brought her thither: It is convenient ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
that she should come and make her self known there: She will
there not only contract no bad habits, nor will her vertue be altered by it:
but she will give also good examples to our Ladies, and read them
Lectures of Fidelity and Constancy. She will teach them, that Marriage
is not a society of Pastimes and Traffick; that the Duties thereof do not
alter with seasons; that its Tyes ought neither to be broken asunder, nor
loosened by Fortune. She will teach them, that they ought to be the same
to their ruined and unfortunate Husbands, as to those that are raised up to
honours, and in favour; that they ought to love them as dearly under a
Chain, as under a Crown; that they ought to bear respect to their ruines,
even to the pieces of their Shipwracks, and to the instruments of their
Punishments.</p>
                  <p>This wife and Couragious Woman was of the House of <hi>Coello,</hi> who
held an Honorable rank amongst the Illustrious Families of <hi>Spain.</hi> But
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55122:117"/>
Nobility without Vertue is but the half of a good Woman. It is a precious
matter to which fair Features and a perfect Figure is wanting. <hi>Jane Coello</hi>
was not one of these shapeless and defective Nobles: she was none of
these rich and rude lumps; of these Marbles which are only esteemed for
the Name and Antiquity of the Quarry from whence they come: All the
features of a good Woman were compleated in her, as the matter was
there pure and precious: And her Vertue was properly to her Nobility,
what an exact and regular Figure is unto a rare piece of Marble.</p>
                  <p>By espousing <hi>Anthony Perez,</hi> she thought not only to have married a
Secretary, and the Favourite of a Prince, a Minister of State, and a great
man in expectation; but she believed to have Espoused all that <hi>Anthony
Perez</hi> was, and could be; And prepared her self to Love him, in what
condition soever Fortune might place him. If all wives entred into Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with the same foresight and preparation: If in the Ceremony of their
Nuptials, and when they are to pronounce this word of Engagement and
Servitude, this great Word which cannot be retracted, they did give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up in such sort, to what is apparently Rich and Glorious: that
they still reserve themselves for what is poor and infirm, to which either
may be reduced, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> behinde the Favourite and the Grandee, they did consider
the misfortunes and ruins which might happen to them; there would be
found more solid pleasure, and more true satisfaction, less disgusts out of
Fancy, and less considerable complaints in Marriages: Bad Fortune would
not disunite so many Couples, nor make so many Divorces: And Wives
equally prepared for the misfortunes and prosperities of their Husbands,
would not change then hearts towards them upon every blast of wind;
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> would have so many different faces as are seen in the Moon. <hi>Iane Coello</hi>
was not subject to this inequality of heart, nor to these varieties of looks.
She doth not alter them with bad times, because bad times produced no
change in her Husband: And knowing that it was <hi>Perez</hi> whom she had
married, and not a Favourite and Minister of State, she was the same to
<hi>Perez</hi> Criminal and a Prisoner, as to <hi>Perez</hi> the Confident and Secretary
of <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>History indeed speaks of the favour and credit of this <hi>Anthony Perez,</hi>
and gives sufficient testimony that his Credit was not a credit acquired at
random, and by meer chance. He served a long time in the place of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of State to <hi>Philip</hi> the second, the ablest Prince of his Age, and the
most knowing in the Science of Princes. He understood all his Policies,
and lived neer those Springs by which this King governed so many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
He was acquainted with the secret of that fatal Cabinet-Councel
where so many Battels and S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eges were designed; where <hi>Europe</hi> was assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

not an unprofitable piece in this Cabinet; and his hand very often set a

so many Engines. But as Fortune never makes a gift of her Person,
though sometimes she lends it: And as the Court is not a Heaven in
which fixed Stars are seen; so <hi>Anthony Perez</hi> fell in his turn from this high

                  <p>Some have written, that the murther of Secretary <hi>Escoredo</hi> was the
cause of his misfortune. But those have seen but the outside of Affairs,
and have taken the Watch for the Spring. We ought rather to believe
the Speculatives of the I scurial, from whom we have learnt by tradition
that the death of <hi>Escoredo,</hi> made away by the secret order of King <hi>Philip,</hi>
was indeed the pretence for imprisoning <hi>Perez.</hi> But the concurrence of
<hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Perez</hi> in the love of the Princess of <hi>Floby</hi> was the true cause of
it. Nature had accomplished with extraordinary Care both the minde
and body of this Princess: but she had formed but one of her eyes; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

would have her rese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

did not hinder her from subjecting a Prince, who boasted of having
two World, under his subjection, and of reigning as long as the Sun
shines. And the Malignant Constellation of <hi>Anthony Perez</hi> designed,
that his inclination should concur with that of his Master.</p>
                  <p>Truly that Concurrence is very perilous; and the danger so much the

to Crowns and Scepters, which take delight in making Honourable and
Soveraign Rivals, which are like that vain-glorious Youth, who would
wrastle and run with none but Kings. But these arrogant and temerarious
Loves are subject to cruel Tragedies: And not long since, remarkable and
sad examples have been seen of them amongst our Neighbors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony Perez,</hi> who was in other things so judicious and prudent, did
not in this make use of his Judgement, nor advised with his Prudence.
He loved the Princess <hi>Floby</hi> with <hi>Philip:</hi> And perchance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to his misfortune,
he was better beloved by her then <hi>Philip.</hi> He had a pleasing and affable
Wit: he Wrote gallantly both in Prose and Verse. He had an excellent
gift in composing a Letter: he translated well a Sonnet and Stanza. His
Services favoured not of Authority, nor resembled Obligations. The
Graces and Muses, which are attractive and perswasive, spake to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
in his behalf. And <hi>Philip</hi> had for himself but a dazling, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
greatness; and that Majestly which tortures Love, and imprisons
the Graces. This good Fortune, if I may stile it so, was the ruine of <hi>Perez<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Philip</hi> chose rather to part with a good Servant, then to endure a Rival more
happy then himself. And the death of <hi>Escoredo</hi> happening in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
he put <hi>Perez</hi> in a Place, where he had leasure to learn, that it is
a dangerous thing to stand in competition with his Master.</p>
                  <p>His Couragious and Faithful Wise, did not account her self a Widow
by the fall of her Husband: she did not believe that his Imprisonment

had set her at Liberty: The Princess of <hi>Floby</hi> was no corrosive to her,
and she did not rejoyce in her minde with <hi>Philip,</hi> for having with one
stroke freed her from a Rival, and himself from a Competitor. These
thoughts of Liberty would have become a tatling Dame, who might

and Heroick, for being stronger and victorious over a more dangerous
Adversary. She perswaded her self, that the most eminent Generosity of
a good Woman, and the perfection of her Vertue consisted in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her self all entire to her divided Husband, and to secure unto him,
even to the last, the donation of her heart, though he should every day
withdraw his own by piece-meal; In accompanying him to what place
soever he should be cast by a storm: And above all in taking as great a share
in his adversities as himself, even in those adversities which are the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his faults.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fortified by these considerations, she made her self a prisoner with
<hi>Perez.</hi> and reserved to her self so much liberty as he wanted; to solicite
their common friends; to implore from time to time the goodness of the
King; to employ by intervals the credit and favour of tears and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the inlargement of her Husband. Behold how many Combats
she fought, how many Victo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

overcame Jealousie, which is the most powerful and dangerous enemy
of Women She deprived her self of liberty and repose, which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and inherent Blessings; Blessings which are not parted with, but by
extream violence. She subdued Avarice, by the continual profusions she
was enforced to make, to render the Gaolers and Guards plyable, in giving
them their fill. She was stronger then a Prison, rigorous and terrible by
reason of its incommodity, but far more rigorous and terrible in respect
of the Princes anger, which had banished all pitty from thence, which
had re-inforced the Gates, and redoubled the obscurities thereof; which
had added a new hardness to the Iron and Walls. In fine, she was victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
over tortures and death it self, exposing her self as she did to both, by
the boldness she shewed in conveying her Husband out of Prison, and in
deceiving the expectation and anger of the Prince. Truly this boldness
was very Ingenious and Witty: And Love was not only resolute in this
action, but a Deceiver in good earnest, and without scandal. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55122:118"/>
all this, the Couragious Woman would have answered with her
head, both for the Inventions of her boldness, and the deceits of her Love,
if <hi>Philip</hi> had consulted with the jealousie he had of his Authority, and of
his Mistress.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony Perez</hi> seeing all wayes barred up against hope; and that not one
single Ray of mercy appeared from the <hi>Escurial,</hi> resolved by the advice of
his Wife to seek of himself an end to his Miseries, without importuning
any more unpowerful Intercessors, and a deaf Clemency. The reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
was, that <hi>Iane Coello</hi> should procure a Womans Garment to be
secretly brought, and that <hi>Perez</hi> in the evening might go forth with her
disguised in this attire, and mingled with the Women of her Train. The
Plot took effect as they had designed it: <hi>Iane Coello</hi> went forth, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with this new Attendant, and intreated the Guards, with gold in
her hand, to permit her Husband to take some rest, who all the last
night could not sleep by reason of his disquiets and discontents. <hi>Perez</hi>
set at Liberty by this Device, repaired to <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, who received
him with Honour. And <hi>Iane Coello</hi> staied behinde in <hi>Spain,</hi> esteemed
by every one for her Courage and Fidelity.</p>
                  <p>I am the first that have shewn this Couragious and Faithful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to <hi>France:</hi> And I now present her unto the Court, to the end
our Ladies may learn of her, that great Expences and studied Excesses
do not form a gallant Woman: That so fair a Figure deserves better
Lineaments and Colours: That the Noblest blood of the World is
obscure, and wants lustre, if Vertue doth not give it. That Marriage
is a Companion as well for bad Times, and rugged Tracks, as for
fair Dayes, and delightful Roads: And that the affection of a good
Woman should resemble Ivy, which sticks close and inseparably to
that Tree which it hath once imbraced, never leaving it, what snow
soever falls upon it, what wind soever shakes it, what tempest soever
bears it down.</p>

She is the wise and vertuous <hi>Paulina,</hi> who became a Stoick
in the house of <hi>Seneca;</hi> and resolves to die in his Company,
and by his Example.</p>
               <p>You may have heard what common rumour hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
of <hi>Neros</hi> ingratitude, and of the Fatal command of
death he sent his Master. This second Parricide no less scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized
the Senate, and all the People, then the first, which is
yet fresh, and whose blood still reales upon the Earth. And
the impiety of the Tyrant after it had caused <hi>Agrippina</hi> to be
murthered, who had been twice his Mother, and brought
him no less into the Empire, then into the world; after it had
put <hi>Seneca</hi> to death, the Instructer of his youth, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his spirit, could not ascend higher, if it rise not up
against God himself; if it fall not on Religion and holy
things. Though this last stroke fell only upon <hi>Seneca,</hi> yet he
is the only person that was not surprized with it: and having
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55122:120"/>
often beheld the soul of <hi>Nero</hi> open, and even to the bottom;
he ever indeed believed that figures of Rhetorick, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
learnt by roat, would not be more acknowledged then
the Life and Empire he received from his Mother.</p>
               <p>He received likewise that barbarous Order with a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
truly Stoick, and worthy the Reputation of his Sect.
He did not appeal to the Senate, he knew very well that the
Senate is now but a Body divested of Power, a dismembred
Body, and still bleeding of the wounds it had received from
the Tyrant. He did not implore Redress from the Laws:
they were all at present either banished or dead. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to obey without noyse or delay: and you could not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
more seasonably to see a Stoick, dying according to the
forms and principles of his Profession. <hi>Paulina</hi> would also
shew, that Constancy belonged to her Sex no less then to
ours; and that VVomen might be Philosophers without
having commerce with <hi>Lycea</hi> and <hi>Portica,</hi> without making
Dilemmaes or Sylogismes. She believed, that being the one
half of <hi>Seneca,</hi> she might be couragious by his Courage, and
dye by the example of his Death, as she had been enriched
by his Riches, and honoured by his Fortune.</p>
               <p>Their Veins hapned to be opened by the same hand and
Lancet. Their blood and spirits were mixt together in their
wounds: And that of <hi>Seneca,</hi> entring into the Arm of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi>
with the Lancet, penetrated her very heart, and seated
it self about her soul. You see also, that being instructed and
fortified by this spirit, which serves for a second reason, and
an accessory Courage, she had the fortitude to expect death
standing, which is the last Act of Soveraign Vertue, and the
true posture of dying Heroes. The blood streamed from
her Arm with violence, as if her soul pressed it to have the
glory of going out the first: And to behold the purest and
most spirituall parts thereof, which spurt up from the Bason
into which it fell, you would say that it takes a pride in the
Nobleness of its Extraction, and conceives it self too well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
to be spilt on the ground. <hi>Paulina</hi> calmly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least alteration beholds it trickling down. And saving
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55122:120"/>
that her Colour vanished away by degrees, and Paleness
succeeded, as it doth to the last Rays of a fair day, which dyes
in a beautiful Cloud, no change was to be seen in her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
               <p>Her Constancy is no savage Constancy: It hath a serenity
and Grace; but it is a pale serenity, and an expiring Grace.
She is more covetous of her Tears and Sighs, then of her
Blood and Life: she prohibited her Eyes and Mouth to
shew the least sign of weakness: And a Statue of white
Marble, which should make a Fountain of its artificiall
Veins, could not have a more peaceable stability, nor a more
gracefull confidence.</p>
               <p>This example is very rare: but it is sad, and cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the mind, but by wounding the heart. The steam of
so Noble Blood draws almost tears from your eyes: And
it afflicts you, that you are not able to save the fair remains of
so beauteous a Life. Let it no longer torment you: The
Tyrant advertised of <hi>Paulina's</hi> generous resolution, sends
Souldiers to hinder her Death, and inforce her to live. Not
that he takes care of the Vertues, or is willing to preserve the
Graces, which are ready to dye with her. He is <hi>Nero</hi> in all
his actions, and doth no less mischief when he saves, then
when he ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

united hearts, and to divide the fairest Couples: It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he takes pleasure in forcing inclinations, and violating
sympathies: It is because he hath a desire to exercise upon
friendships and souls an interiour and spirituall Tyranny:
It is because after the death of <hi>Seneca,</hi> he will have the heart
of <hi>Seneca</hi> in his power.</p>

to make, yet they will enforce her to retreat, and fasten her
again to life, by binding up her wounds. It were to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

                  <hi>Seneca:</hi> But if they had Swathes and Remedies to apply to

Swathes, and killing Remedies. The last year he caused the

               <p>It is not the good old mans fault, that his soul is not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at liberty: he presseth it with vehemency enough; and
hath made for it Orifices large enough in all his Veins. But
<hi>Seneca</hi> must be long a dying, that his lingring death may be
a lasting Instruction, and a Pattern of a large extent. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this <hi>Seneca</hi> is not the man of whom Envy and Detraction
hath made so many false Pictures. I perceive nothing of
weakness or vice wherewith they reproach him. And this
Death, what ever ignorant and traducing spirits say, cannot
be the Tragedy of a seemingly Vertuous person, of a
masked Philosopher, of a Counterfeit and Sophisticall
Doctor.</p>
               <p>His calm and setled Constancy, shews outwardly the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of his mind. He seems to confirm with his eyes, and
brow, whatsoever he hath written concerning the contempt
of Fortune and Death: You would say that he alledges
himself for the proof of his Doctrine. He Philosophizes by
as many mouths, as there are wounds: And every drop of
his blood is a Stoicall Demonstration: A proof of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and a testimony which he renders to the Courage of
his Sect. His weeping and mourning friends receive with
his last words, the last spirit of Philosophy, and the pure
lights which already his almost loosned and descryed Soul
diffuseth.</p>
               <p>The attention they give him is full of respect, and hath
something, I know not what, of Religion: It would be
hard to say, whether it be to his voice or blood they are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
whether it be the dictates of his mouth, or those of his
wounds which they write.</p>
               <p>In this extremity this severe man, who so boldly looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Death, as if he were seeing a Mask, dares not fix his eyes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55122:121"/>
upon <hi>Paulina.</hi> I think that he apprehends lest friendship
might soften his spirit, and the Husband be found more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
in his heart then the Philosopher. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at this tenderness. It is not unseemly in a wise man. He
may with credit afflict himself for another: And the Tears
which friendship hath exprest, may decently trickle down on
his Face.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PAulina</hi> who is still victorious over death in this Picture, informs us
that Philosophy hath no Sex; that it communicates it self without
making any distinction between Garments and Faces: That the
Graces themselves may become Valiant, and Couragious under her
Discipline: And that Cowardise proceeds from the corruption of the heart,
and not from the tenderness of the temper, nor the dispositions of Fortune.
It likewise informs us that Vertue must needs be very weak, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55122:122"/>
superficial in the greatest part of Christian Ladies, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
themselves about a Necklace and a few Pearls; who have their
hearts fixed on a lac'd Petticoat, who are slaves to a small Fortune,
which to express it well, is but a figure of guilded dirt. The least they
can expect, is to be condemned by this Heathen woman, who had a soul
dis-ingaged from Riches which may vie with those of Kings; who
had a free heart even in the arms of a Fortune which was as large
as the Empire; and which raised jealousie even in the Fortune of the
Emperour himself. The ensuing Question will manifest, whether <hi>Paulina</hi>
could be a Philosopher and a Stoick; and whether I had reason to say that
Philosophy hath no Sex.</p>

                  <head type="sub">VVhether VVomen be capable of true Philosophy.</head>
                  <p>A Woman hath been heretofore seen playing the Orator in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
places, who did with unprofitable and studied Discourses,
what the Mountebanks now adayes use to do with their Drugs,
and Antick faces. There was also a lewd Woman, who affected a brutish
and impudent Freedom: who braved Fortune and Nature with a Staff
and Wallet; who was Beggerly and Arrogant; and who had, under a rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and tottered Garment, a worse Pride then is found under cloth of Gold
and Purple: Both the one and the other was called Philosophy; But both
had but the name and a false mask, which drew Spectators to them.
And certainly if no other Philosophy had descended from Heaven,
then from this bawling and Arrogant Creature: I should have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
concluded, that a good Woman could have no commerce
with Philosophy. There is a third, which is the true Mistress of
Life, and the Directress of Manners: which hath the general charge
of Vertue and Sciences; and is no enemy to the Graces: which is
endowed with a modest Capacity, and a Courage without Pride or
Fierceness. And if the Question be concerning this Philosophy, we
must boldly say, and without fearing to do her injury, that she hath
no Sex, no more then the Intelligences: that she is come as well for
Women as Men; and she being the last perfection of the Understanding,
and the compleatment of Reason, all rational Souls are equally capable
of her Discipline.</p>
                  <p>And to the end this Decision may be established with Method, it is to
be noted, that there is Philosophy Speculative and Scientifical, and a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55122:123"/>
Philosophy which is Moral and Active: Both are within the Sphear of
Womens understanding, and have no Functions, which exceed their
forces. The Speculative doth contemplate the Works of God, and the
secrets of Nature: She studieth the Harmony of the World, and
the marvellous Agreements both of the superiour and inferiour parts
composing it. And the end of her contemplation and study is the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
she receives from known Verities, and acquired Sciences.
The Moral flies not ordinarily so high, but her study is Practical, and
her Knowledges are applyed to Action. Her Office is to govern the
Liberty of Man, to marke him out Bounds, and regulate his Actions; and

within the limits thereof.</p>
                  <p>Surely in all this, there is nothing, which the Understanding of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
may not attain; nothing which is above their reach, and the tracts
which Nature hath laid open to them. Why should they not be as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
as our selves of Contemplation, and of the Sciences belonging to
Speculative Philosophy? Are their souls more Terrestrial, and more fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to matter then ours? Are they of a different Temper, and of another
Extraction? Hath Nature clogged them with some ponderous load? Hath
she tyed them with some chain to keep them from ascending? Are they
absolutely uncapable of those wings, which <hi>Plato</hi> hath observed in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
souls? All things then are equal between Men and Women, in
respect of the soul, which is the Intelligent part, and makes Learned men
and Philosophers: And if there be any Inequality in relation to the body,
as the same cannot be denyed, Women have the advantage, and it Perfects
in them the Capacity whereof I Discourse.</p>
                  <p>Some reproach them with the Humidity of their Complexion; but no
Man will reproach them of it, when he shall remember that moistness is
the matter of which those Images are formed which are useful to Sciences;
That it is the proper temper of the Memory, which is the Depository and
Nurse thereof; that it can contribute to the light of the Understanding, as
it doth to that of the body; that the moist Stars and Planets, have no
less brightness, then the other: And that dry heads are not reputed to be
the most replenished, and best furnished.</p>
                  <p>As for tenderness, without doubt they that make it the subject of their
Accusation, have not advised with <hi>Aristotle.</hi> They would then know, that
the most delicate Temper, is the least burthen'd with matter; the most
pure, and apt to be penetrated by the Lights of the Understanding: The
best prepared for fair Images; and for the Impression of Sciences. Saint
<hi>Thomas</hi> also, being to prove the Natural Excellency of the minde of <hi>Iesus
Christ,</hi> conceived that he could not alleadge a more pertinent Reason, then
the Delicacy of his Complexion. And generally the most tender and frail
matters are particularly covered in most subtile and perfect Forms. And the
rarest and most accomplished pieces of the Arts, are ordinarily framed of
Silk, ingraven on Christal, and turned in Ivory. Nature hath but one soul
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55122:123"/>
intelligent &amp; capable of Discipline: And this Soul is the form of the weakest
parts of the whole Body. And even in this so frail Body, the seat of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
and Reason is not in the Bones and Nerves, but in the Brain,
which is the softest and most tender part. Whereunto one may likewise add,
that in Politick Bodies, the more knowing sort of Men are not composed
of Tradesmen and Labourers; of those ignoble Members, who are of
strong complexion, and hardened by Labour: They are Studious and
Sedentary Persons; such as have been brought up in Repose and
in the shade.</p>
                  <p>Quickness is only remaining, which malicious Persons call Lightness,
and whereof they think to compose a strong piece against Women, who
pretend to Sciences. But to weaken this piece, and unnerve its force, A
question is only to be asked of those who busie themselves about it, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ponderosity arises from the mind, and Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ty from matter? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Angels and Planets, Intelligence, and Light, make things heavy
and immovable? And whether amongst Men, the able be the slow, and
the quick the stupid? Sciences require the wings of Eagles, and not the
feet of Tortuses. This is the reason why the Seraphins, who are the most
knowing and Theological Intelligences, have wings up to their heads. The
very word <hi>Discourse</hi> is a word of agility and quickness: And not to say,
that the eyes which are in us, the only parts capable of Study, cannot
Study, but by a continual motion: The Animal spirits, which are assistants
of Reason, and the material Springs of an immaterial Action, are the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and the most agile part of our substance.</p>
                  <p>Let us then acknowledge, that Women may share with us in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of Sciences. Nature had no designe to exclude that Sex from them:
And the reasons themselves which are alledged against their Right, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it the more, and have the force of new titles. It is known also that
since the time of the Muses, which were Female Sages erected into God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses:
there is no Age which hath not had a sufficient number of most
capable Women. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But these dead proofs, and remote from our sight, are not necessary

would have in this point all the Authority, which an approved
and renowned Academy might have. There is in that House a Mother
and a Daughter, in whom the pure tincture of the Roman Spirit is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
with the good Blood and Generosity of the Ancient Republick.
They are both of them knowing in the Science of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

who were the Cabinet-Councel, the Domestique Theater of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
and Dictators. But let no man believe that there is a pride and
presumption in this Science: That it is one of those which turn the brain
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55122:124"/>
and cause Convulsions in the minde. Let no man take it for a Mass of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disgested
and tumultuary Notions, for a collection of Fables and Histories
learnt by roat. It is Modest and Civil with vigour: It is solid without
ostentation and rudeness: It conduceth to the conduct of life, and the
regulation of manners: And it wants nothing of that which may give
imployment and adress to the Muses, Comeliness and Ornament to the
Graces. And of these two rare and learned Persons, there may be made an
illustrious Demonstration, concerning the Capacity of Women: And by
the same reason that heretofore it hath been said, that <hi>Athens</hi> was the <hi>Greece</hi>
of <hi>Greece,</hi> one may well say in reference to them, that the House of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
is the Court of the Court: I do not say of the interressed, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
and corrupted Court; I say of the ingenious and spiritual, of the
Gallant and Modest Court. Nevertheless, whatever I have said, it is
not my intention to summon Women to the Colledge; I intend not to
make Graduats of them, nor convert their Needles and Distaffs into
Astrolabes and Sphears I bear too much respect to the bounds which
fever us: And my question is only in order to what they may, and not
unto what they ought in the condition wherein things have been placed,
whether by the Order of Nature, or by an immemorable Custom, and as
old as Nature her self.</p>
                  <p>But surely, as I would not hold with those who should perform in
their Closets all the Exercises and Functions of a Colledge: Who should
discourse only in Enthymema's and Syllogisms: And should have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in their heads but the Ideas of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the Atoms of <hi>Epicurus:</hi>
So cannot I sufficiently praise those which put themselves under the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of that other practical and active Philosophy, which illuminates
the minde with her lights, and fortifies it with her principles: which esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth
Decency in Manners, and Stability in Life; which adjusts all
Conditions and all Fortunes to her rules. First, if there be a question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Capacity, it cannot be brought in dispute in relation to them:
Some have been found amongst them, who have followed as close as any
man the most sublime and speculative Philosophy; who have run through
all that may be open to Humane reason, and have been more eminent
then <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and more ancient then <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Theophrastes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover this practical Philosophy is not of an unknown Country,
nor out of the Common Road: It is not needful to have the wings and
sight of an Eagle to approach her; one may go thither a foot-pace, and
from all the Regions of the World: from all the degrees of State, and
from all the orders of life. She hath Disciples that are Soveraigns, and
Disciples that are Slaves. And in her Schools King and Subject, Rich
and Poor, Master and Servant, have their assigned places according to the
diversity of their Conditions, and the difference of their Offices. Besides,
the perfection of this Philosophy is not cumbersom, nor subject to disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
She allowes all other Lawful professions, and accommodates her
self to all degrees of Fortune: she gives Lessons for affairs, and for the
whole world: she gives them also for repose and solitude: And to learn
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55122:124"/>
these Lessons, it is not necessary that a Woman should abandon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of her houshold affairs: That she should be divorced from her
Husband; that she should renounce honest Pleasures, and Civil Society,
That she should shut her self up in a Chamber hung with Maps, and
furnished with Sphears and Astrolabes.</p>
                  <p>Let us add, that Moral Philosophy hath been given us to order our
Passions, to distinguish our Duties, and Offices, to teach the exercises of
Vertue, to guide us as by the hand to Beatitude. And have not Womens
Passions need of a Governess as well as Ours? May they not be mistaken
in their Offices and Duties? Are they born so well instructed, and perfect,
that they can learn Vertue without a Lesson or Method? Are they so
happy that they can attain to Be atitude by their own address, and without
a guid? The injustice would be then extream to deprive them of this
Philosophy, the Governess of Passions, the Mistress of Vertues, and the
necessary Guide for all those that pretend to Beatitude.</p>
                  <p>In fine, Women as well as we are to defend themselves against the
Gifts, and Outrages of Fortune: They are apt to Swellings and Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which follow good and bad Accidents: And no man hath a head
so naturally strong, that be can bear Prosperity without the Vertigo, or
Adversity without fainting and weakness. Ought we to expect that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
should be preserved from all these infirmities by the meer strength of
their Constitution; that their heads should not turn round upon the top
of the Wheel, and amidst the perfumes of good Fortune, that their hearts
should not change their seats, when they themselves shall change their
Posture; and that those hearts should stand after their owners fall? There
is no Constitution so well prepar'd, nor of so good a temper, from which
this Constancy and Equality ought to be expected without the help of
Moral Philosophy. And therefore we must conclude, that Philosophy is
not only neither against the Decorum, nor beyond the capacity of the
second Sex; but that she is an Ornament and a necessary support to it; and
that neither good nor gallant Women can be formed, but according to the
Designes, and by the Rules of Morality.</p>
                  <p>All the vertuous and magnanimous Women, which we admire in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
have been modelled according to these Designes, and compleated by
these Rules. We have known, and do know also some, who have the same
features, and are composed after the same manner: And if I did not fear
that some might accuse me of Flattery, and Affectation, I would here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,

<hi>England,</hi> which he had overthrown, <hi>Edward</hi> the Son of <hi>Scymer</hi> his
third Wife, succeeded to his Crown and Dominions: But as there is no
Seed so unhappy, nor of so short a durance as that of wicked men; so
the Excommunication and Curse, which had been Fulminated against
the Father, being fallen upon the Son, this poor Prince died before he
knew well how to live. And by a Will which he made, through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swassions
of <hi>Dudley</hi> Duke of <hi>Northumberland, Jane Gray</hi> was declared his
Heir. It may be said, without detraction, that this Will was dictated by
Ambition: But it may also be said without flattery, that it was made in
savour of the Graces and Vertues, to the advantage of the Sciences and
Muses: And the Crown of <hi>England</hi> could not be placed upon a more
beautiful head, or which could do it more Honour, then that of the
Lady <hi>Iane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She was born with those Attractives and Charmes, which seat a kinde
of Soveraignty upon the face of the most beautiful Persons, and which
give a Natural Unction to them, and a Diadem without gold or precious
stones: Her minde was endued with far more soveraign Attractives,
and with Charms of far greater force then her face. And these native
and adorning Graces, were accompanied with other acquired and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ones, which much increased their value, and gave them a second
tincture of goodness, and a new lustre. She spake both Greek and Latine
as if she had been of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome:</hi> she had an exact knowledge of
the Liberal Sciences, and perfectly understood both kinds of Philosophy.
But that which is more to be esteemed then all her Philosophy, more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Nevertheless we must speak the truth: All these so rare and highly

                     </gap>ed qualities, were not considered in the Will, which was made in
favour of <hi>Iane. Edward</hi> died as weak as he had lived: He abandoned his
last Testament to the will of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> as he had done
all the rest, and the Duke abused him in his death, as he had done in his
youth. This ambitious Minister of State, not being content with having
Raigned without a Crown by the toleration of his Master to whom he had
left but a specious Regality, and a coloured Dignity; perceiving a gate
open, by which <hi>Iane,</hi> who was married to the Lord <hi>Guilford</hi> his fourth
son, might bring the Crown into his House, he undertook to take
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55122:125"/>
it from the Kings sister, and to set it upon her Head, either by Right
or Force.</p>
                  <p>To this effect he besieges the minde of this poor Prince, already spent
with his sickness, and disquiered at the presence of death. He was made
believe that he could not in Conscience call to the Succession, either <hi>Mary</hi>
the daughter of <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> or <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daughter of <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi>
He alledgeth against the first, that being cut off the Royal Family by
the Divorce of her Mother, she could not be restored to it without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the Memory of the deceased King, and without giving Credit
and Authority to the Roman Tyranny. He opposed against the other that
being stained with the Adulteries and the punishment of her Mother, she
would fully the Honour and Dignity of the Crown if she had but touchd
it. From thence he concludes, that <hi>Iane Gray</hi> descended from <hi>Henry</hi> the
seventh by <hi>Mary,</hi> heretofore Queen of <hi>France,</hi> being the last drop of Royal
blood, which was sound yet pure and without stain; he could not make
another Heir, without casting Fire into the Royal Family.</p>
                  <p>The Declaration was made for these reasons in favour of <hi>lane:</hi> The
Councel of four and twenty approve it, notwithstanding the opposition
of the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> And two dayes after, the King rendring
up his soul, <hi>Iane</hi> is declared Queen of <hi>England.</hi> Her Father the Duke of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Father to her Husband, went to
acquaint her with this news, and prepare her to receive chearfully so great
a Fortune. This Fortune was the first dangerous Temperess, against which
<hi>Iane</hi> had need of Inspirations, and helps from Philosophy.</p>
                  <p>And here it will be confessed, that one ought to be supported by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy;
That one ought to have a heart extreamly good, and a strong head
peece, not to fall into a Trance at such news. Reason ought to be very
clear, and the understanding very pure to recive without amazement so
sudden and surprising a vapour. I might also apprehend that I should not
be believed, but rather accused of an Hyperbole, if I said, that <hi>Iane</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
one of the greatest Crowns of the World, with the same Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as if she had received a Posie of Violets. Regality is not a present to

of Stoicks, and the most zealous Preachers of Indolence and Aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
seeing themselves not called to Soveraignty by Fortune, and not
knowing how to attain to it by a straight and lawful way, were so bold
as to use violence, and aspire to it by Tyrannie. However I will not descend
from so high a proposition: I intend to go yet higher, and will rise to
something which is more eminent and more Heroick. <hi>Iane</hi> would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at least civilly, and with thanks a Posie of Violets: She absolutely
refused the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> And this so gallant and generous a refusal
proceeded from a more Stoical soul then that of <hi>Zeno,</hi> from a more Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
heart then that of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>

Not that she did not well understand the value of this Crown which
she refused: Nor was she affrighted with so resplendent a Fortune, as
she would have been terrified by a luminous Fantosme presented before
her eyes. But she knew also that there was Weight and Thornes in this
Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this Fortune with all its Glory, and all these Charms did
not tempt her, not appeared to her so lovely, as Justice, Tranquility, or
Philosophy. Solicited by the Supplications and Reasons of her Kindred
and Husband, who press'd her to consent to her greatness, and not to reject
a Felicity which is rare, and never presents it self twice to the same Gate:
She answered, t<q>hat the Laws of the Kingdom, and Natural right stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Kings Sisters, she would beware of burthening her Head
and Conscience with a Yoke which did belong to them: that she under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the Infamy of those who had permitted the violation of Right to
gain a Crown. But it were to mock God, and deride Justice to scruple
at the stealing of a shilling, and not at the Usurpation of a Crown. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
went she on, I am not so young, nor so little read in the guiles of
Fortune to suffer my self to be taken by them: If she inrich any one, it
is but to make him the subject of her spoil: If she raise others, it is but
to please her self with their ruins. What she adored but yesterday, is to day
her pastime. And if I now permit her to adorn and Crown me, I must
to morrow suffer her to crush and tear me in pieces. Besides, with what
Crown she doth present me? A Crown which hath been violently and
shamefully wrested from <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who dislikes the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Arme</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> and of others, who wore it after her. Why would
you have me add my blood to theirs, and to be the fourth Victime, from
whom this Fatal Crown may be ravished with the Head? But in case it
should not prove fatal to me, and that all its venom were consumed: If
Fortune should give me warranties of her Constancy; should I be well
advised to take upon me these Thornes which would delacerate, though
not kill me outright; to burthen my self with a Yoke, which would not
fail to torment me, though I were assured not to be strangled with it? My
Liberty is better then the chain you proffer me, with what precious stones
soever adorned, and of what gold soever framed. I will not exchange my
Peace for Honourable and Precious Jealousies, for magnificent and
glorious Fetters. And if you love me sincerely, and in good earnest, you
will rather wish me a secure and quiet Fortune, though mean, then an
elevated Condition exposed to the wind, and followed by some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
fall.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Reasons were powerful, and must needs be perswasive, yet they
took not effect: The ambition of the Dukes of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi>
was more prevalent. The Lord <hi>Guilford</hi> fortified her with his reasons:
And <hi>Iane</hi> overcome by so many pressing Solicitors, and in Authority, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to them her Freedom and Life. This resignation, proceeded from
a Soveraign Vertue, and a consummated Philosophy: And not doubting
but a Scaffold was prepared for her behinde the Throne; and that the
Crown which was offered her might not cause the loss of her Head, she
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55122:126"/>
submitted her self to Fortune, and consented to accept of Soveraignty with
more courage and moderation, then she had refused it. Matters being
thus concluded, they brought her to <hi>London,</hi> where she was solemnly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
Queen, and received with Ceremony, the Oath of Fealty from
all degrees. But this Oath held as little as her Soveraignty. And scarce
had she spent ten days in the Tower, according to the Ceremony observed
by new Kings, but the Parliament and People retracted them Oath and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
and delivered her up to the Princess, <hi>Mary,</hi> her Rival, and the
Lawful Heir of the Crown.</p>
                  <p>A more Eloquent man then my self, would say, that Fortune irritated by
her Refusals, plaid her this Prank to humble her Virtue, and to take revenge
of the cruelty of her Philosophy: I had rather say, and I will speak it more
Christianly, and with more appearance of truth, that it was God who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
this revolution, to save <hi>Jane</hi> by her fall; and to draw to himself by
a Scaffold, so pure and couragious a Virtue, which evidently had perished if
she had grown old upon the Throne. There are dangerous Prosperities,

wholsom Adversities, and edifying Falls: And those happen to us when
God resumes for us his thoughts of Peace, and disposeth us to Grace. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial

with Rhubarb; They triumph in the danger of their Souls, and praise God
for the marks of Reprobation. They deplore the presages and earnest of
their Salvation: And they desire so unhandsomly, they pray so propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously,
and in so bad terms, as if God were to punish them, he could not
do it more severely, then in hearing their prayers, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Iane</hi> judged more solidly of Gods designs, and of the course of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
And albeit so great a Revolution was a very distasteful Remedy,
yet she couragiously resigned her self thereunto, and took it with much
cheerfulness. Being sent prisoner to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> it was observed
that she entred it with as Serene a countenance, and with the same dignity
of look and action, as she had done the first time to begin the sad Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of her fatal Reign. While she remained there, she remitted nothing
of her Constancy, and her usual Studies. Vigour and Authority appeared
in all her words: all her actions were free through the freedom of her
Minde; which was enriched with a milde Grace, and a confident Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty:
And even in the Pallace, and upon the Throne it self, she could
not have more Majesty, nor appear more Resplendant and Sove<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raign.</p>
                  <p>The Sentence of Death being pronounced, she Couragiously submitted
to it, and answered nothing else, but <q>That her Crime was not for having
laid her hand upon the Crown, but for not having rejected it with force
enough. That she had less erred through Ambition, then out of respect
and reverence to her friends: That her respect, nevertheless, was a Crime,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55122:127"/>
and that her reverence deserved punishment: that she would willingly
admit of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that she could do no less then render satisfaction to
the State, and voluntarily take off, and in obedience to the Laws, the
Scandal which she had given by a forced Obedience and rendred by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
to her kindred.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Her Husband condemned to the same punishment, having sent to give
her the last visit, to the end he might arm himself with the example of her
Constancy, and by the vertue of her last words. She sent him word, <q>That he
demanded a lenative, which would put fire into the wound; and that it
was to be feared, her presence would rather weaken, then strengthen him.
That he ought to take courage from his Reason, and derive Constancy
from his own heart, and that if his soul were not firm and settled, she
could not settle it by her eyes, nor confirm it by her words: That he
should do well to remit this interview to the other world: That there,
indeed friendships were happy, and Unions indissolvable; and that
theirs would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ternal, if their souls carried nothing with them of Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial,
which might hinder them from rejoyning.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As she was led to the place of Execution, she passed by a Gallery from
whence she saw her Husbands body carried to the Chappel of the Tower.
This unexpected Object somewhat moved her, and begot compassion in
her. But it was a manly, and wel becoming compassion; and this Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did not so strongly invade her mind, as to hinder it from furnishing her
in repose with three Sentences, in three Languages. She wrote them down
in her Table-book, which she gave to the Lieutenant of the Tower, with
an excuse for the trouble she had given him. The Greek expressed, that
if his Executed body should give testimony against her before men, his
most blessed soul would give an Eternal proof in the presence of God, of
her Innocence. The Latin added, that humane Justice was against his
Body, but the Divine mercy would be for his Soul. The English con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that if her fault deserved punishment, her youth at least, and her
imprudence, were worthy of excuse; and that God and posterity would
shew her favor.</p>
                  <p>Constancie, Grace, and Majesty, which had ever accompanied her, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
also upon the Scaffold with her. One would have said that all
that was seen there could be nothing else but a meer representation of her
punishment; And that all this Tragical preparation, was but a fiction,
and a meer Ceremony. She rendred thanks to the Catholick Divine,
who had assisted her, and comforted her dispairing servants, with so well
composed a manner, and with so vigorous and Noble words, so full of
Judgement and Courage, as it seemed to some, that if Philosophy her self
had been to dye, she could not have dyed more couragiously, and with
more Dignity.</p>
                  <p>She made her self ready for the stroak of the Executioner; and to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
her beauty, though it were innocent of her Misfortune, she made a
Wreath or Head-band of her own Hair, whereof it seemed Nature had
formed her a Diadem. They offered to strike off her head with a Sword, as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55122:127"/>
if the Sword could have diminished the shame of her punishment, and
Dignified her Death, and the hand of the Executioner. But she rejected
this unprofitable and superstitious Ceremony: And resolved to be Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the same Ax which newly came from the Execution of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
Whether that she desired to mingle her bloud with his; Whether
she believed that a more painful death would be a more just Expiation of
her faults: And that the Iron of the Ax would better purifie her soul, then
the Iron of the Sword.</p>
                  <p>Such was the end of the Reign and Life of <hi>Iane Grey,</hi> who was an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi>
and <hi>Roman</hi> in <hi>England</hi> many Ages after the ruin of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
She shewed our Predecessors an Image of the ancient Constancy, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Vertue. And taught us that the Graces may be learned, as well as
the Muses; That Philosophy belongs to both Sexes; And that even in our
daies, under the Purple, and upon the Throne, she might be as vigorous
and couragious, as she was heretofore under the Wallet, and in the Tub
of the <hi>Sunck.</hi>

France, which is so noble a Mother, so Generous, so Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized,

and that under so temperate a Climate, and so benign Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
there should be found souls of the same temper with
those which are born under the Pole. But let him be a
French man by birth, and a Tartar or Scythian by nature, it
doth not hunder Vertue, which playes the principall part in
this Action, from being French. And this second <hi>Judith</hi> will
one day more honour her Country, then this second <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes</hi>
could disgrace it.</p>
               <p>You see the boldness of her Countenance, and the Vertue
of her Face. There is much of <hi>Judith</hi> in both. But there is
more then the Look and Face; more then the boldness and
Vertue of <hi>Judith:</hi> It is no common chaste woman you see: It
is a Virgin, nay a victorious Virgin which newly fought,

for the end of his Tyrannie, and for the punishment of his
Crimes. VVine and Sleep had already closed up his eyes,
and tyed his hands, and there wanted but a Sword and an
Executioner to make a great and celebrious example of him.
His Arms being near at hand, the chaste French woman,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55122:129"/>
inspired by the same Angel who inspired the chaste Iew, took
advantage of the Sleep and Sword of her enemy, and made
of <hi>Amolon</hi> an <hi>Holyfernes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two great wounds which you see in his head, were
given by that fair and chaste Hand. Pain awakened his
bound up, and benummed Reason: and the first drops of
his blood extinguished the dishonest fire which the Tears
and Prayers of this innocent Maid had enkindled. He is no
longer the same brutish and furious person as before. The
wanten flames of his heart, and the impure imaginations of
his head are all fallyed forth at his wounds: Iudgement and
Respect are entred in their Room: you would say that he
awakes with new eyes. Those at least retained no longer any
thing of that sulphure which was enkindled by the smallest
Rayes of Beauty, and which was set on fire by every lovely
glance which issued from it.</p>
               <p>He seems to endure with torment the sight of his chaste
and couragious Enemy: He suffers it nevertheless, and his
confusion mixed with astonishment, his shame accompanied
with reverence, make a silent Declaration upon his face, by
which he justifies the attempt, and acknowledges it for a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Victory: He doth consider that the same person is in
his power who had newly plunged him in blood, and who
had heretofore inflamed him; who had pierced his heart,
and newly wounded his head: He no longer remembers his
Love, he resents not his injury. His eyes and mind are too

               <p>However I much fear that this Imagination of <hi>Amolon</hi> may
not be powerfull enough to protect our <hi>Judith,</hi> if we do not
defend her against those furious Attendants, whom their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
blood hath irritated. I see her in eminent danger, if she
be only guarded by her Graces, and the light which environs
her. These people do not acknowledge the Graces: and
the fire of anger which they have in their eyes, diverts their
sight from his light. They stretch out their arms against this
innocent VVoman, and before they touch her, they tear
her in pieces afar off with frightful cryes and gestures, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ending
Cruelty. You would say, that their looks would be
first with the prey; And that they had a minde to tast it with
their teeth and nails.</p>
               <p>This precipitated and barbarous fury, doth astonish you.
It would amaze bolder men then you are: But this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of minde, and this Heroick Constancy in a Maid, is to
me a far greater astonishment, and Posterity which shall
read her History will be no less amazed. The former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencies
and Offers begot much more fear in her, then the
present Cryes and Threats. And because her Honour is
now in safety, and that her life is onely assaulted, she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the danger wholly past, and that all this tumult threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
some other Person. Having heard of the victorious
Virgins and Martyrs of Chastity, she regards not the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
these furious People intend against her. Her thoughts
are only fixed on the good she may receive from their fury;
and looks upon them as People, who will bestow upon her
a second Crown.</p>
               <p>Zeal, Boldness, and Modesty, are, I know not how,
either associated, or confounded upon her Brow and
Cheeks. It is indeed rather a confusion then a superficial
Alliance. But it is a pleasing and luminous confusion; and a
fire reflects from thence, like that which streams from the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55122:130"/>
richest Scarlet. VVill you not believe that it is from this
fire the Chamber is enlightned, and that the splendor of
those branched Lights, pendant from the seeling, is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
thereby? It seems also that some Rayes are fallen
from thence, which give a new lustre to this Sword, and
which are as it were a recompence for the service it hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in this danger to forsaken and unarmed Vertue.</p>
               <p>The astonishment and respect of <hi>Amolon</hi> increased, and
being more confirmed then before in his first idle fancies, he
gives a sign to his people to convert their anger into Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to adore her, whom they desire to tear in pieces. But
it is to require too much of furious men: Let them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
their hands and fury: Let them offer no violence to
Innocence, and we will discharge them of their Religion and
VVorship.</p>

                  <p>We see also, that the number is far greater of brave Spirits, who have

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>vils which beget fear and dispair,
and are opposite to Valour. This at first sight appears incredible: And the
Ignorant will suspect it for a <hi>Paradox</hi> and an <hi>Hyperbole.</hi> It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> true neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and the proof will be easie to those who know the different Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Good and Bad, and the several instincts of the Will. The first
Action of Good is like that of the Loadstone; it attracts the Will, and
forcibly fastens it self to it: It doth yet more; it Dilates the Will which it
hath fastened to its self; and penetrates it with a pleasing and violent sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which hath wherewith to gain and overcome it. Nevertheless, it
hath no need of violence against the Will: She renders her self up freely to
what is Good, and expects not to be forced from it. She embraceth all
that resembleth it: She ever gapes after the Odour and Shadow thereof.
And her happiness consisting in being united to it, she cannot repel it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
suppressing or suspending her instinct, without acting against her self,
and offering violence to Nature. Her instinct and disposition in respect of
Evil, are far different from the other. As it is an Object of Terror, which
woundeth by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> presence, the Will also cannot endure the Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She flies eagerly, even from the appearances and presages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and for this she needs neither new vigour nor force but her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
contrariwise she would have need of a second vigour more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
then the first; and it would be necessary that she should offer violence
to her instinct: If she were, I do not say, to follow Evil, but even to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it quietly, and to suspend the hatred she bears it. It is then more easie
to fight against Evil. and to overcome it by a propense and natural resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
then to repell Good, and obtain such a forced victory over it, as is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
to Nature, and constrains her Inclinations. And this truth being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
I leave unto others to judge, whether the Combats of Valour be
more hazardous and painfull, then those of Chastity: And whether to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55122:133"/>
support Nature, and to repulse with her by joynt Forces a danger which
affrights and threatens her, it be necessary to imploy more Vigour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
and act more couragiously, and with more resolution, then to force
her Inclinations to suppress her instinct and desires; to snatch from her
a Good which is Interiour, and Adherent to her; a pressing and obstinate
Good; a Good, which is supported by many other Goods, which are her
Solicitors and Agents, which render it valuable and sustains it.</p>
                  <p>This is a third Reason, which much increaseth the dangers of Chastity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the need she hath to be wel armed with courage &amp; warlike Discipline.
She is not only to defend her self from voluptuousness, which is an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and pressing Enemy: And which can hardly be vanquished, either
by open force, diversion, or stratagem. But she is likewise to overcome
Avarice, Vanity, and Ambition: She is to resist Engines of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Batteries of Diamonds and Pearls, and generally all the Assaults
which a potent Love, assisted by Fortune is able to give. Some Men go
about to Debauch even Reputation and Honour from the service of
Chastity, and to imploy them some times against her with better Success
then Pleasure and Riches; nay, then death it self and punishments, as it
hapned in the fall of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Now it is certain that Gold and Silver are
the Engines which overcome all things; with them Towns are taken
which have held out against Canons and Mines: By them Armies have
been defeated, which had resisted Fire and Sword, the injuries of Weather,
and the fury of the Elements: And a Woman hath need of far greater force
then that of the Heroes, to maintain a Battery, which hath broken whole
Legions, and overthrown C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tadels. There are also but too many of them
who surrender to it. And in these sorts of Combats, Victories are daily
gain'd with Gold and Pearl. Nevertheless that which is remarkable, even
Riches, Honors, Presents and Hopes, which have so much power to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Chastity, are helps which incourage valour, and Fortifie it: And the
valiant raise themselves great and resplendent Fortunes, out of the same
things, which turne chaste Women.</p>
                  <p>There is much more then this; And as if Chastity had not enemie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
enough of her own, she is to contest with those of Valour and Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
She is not onely assaulted by voluptuousness, and battered with pieces
of Gold, and Silver, with Presents and Offers, with Weapons which
wound the soul by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

which they propose to her is not a resplendent and specious death, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
and Glorious death, like that of valiant Men, but a hideous and
Tragick Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Death accompanied with Torments, and like those
which are bewailed upon Theaters. The chief thing is, that she is not to
contend with this death, and these Torments by resistance, and by repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them with the Sword, as in War: This Combat would be easie, and
Nature would both side with her, and support her. But she must over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by Patience, and in suffering all that an Irritated passion and become
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55122:134"/>
furious, can make one suffer. And Nature, to which sufferance is averse, not
assisting her in this kinde of fight: She must have a strong resolution, and
a very Heroick Courage to resist all alone Fire and Sword, and hold out
against the Rack and Tortures.</p>
                  <p>Those are truly to be esteemed, who expose themselves freely to so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Deaths as there be Grains of Lead, and Pikes of Iron in the Army of an
Enemy; who remain firm before artificial Thunders which strike at a
greater distance, and cause more Murthers then those of Nature. But the
end of those Persons, how resolute soever they be, is not to put back the
Goods which are offered them, and less also to abandon themselves to the
Evils which appear and threaten them: She is to acquire all that they see
of Riches and Crowns in the hands of Victory: She is to retort death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Enemies, and with Death, all the evils which accompany it, as
well as those that follow it. Chastity hath Objects and Pretensions quite
opposite to these: And it is her duty to vanquish equally things delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and formidable: The delightful, by a generous refusal; the formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by an immoveable Patience, and both by an Heroick Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>The couragious <hi>Susanna</hi> was to fight and overcome all these sorts of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
drawn together against her in one single Occasion. She vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Pleasure, which hath put so many Heroesses under the yoke, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Conquerers in chains. She overcame Infamy, which is the great Bug-Bear
of her Sex: She overcame Death, even the Death due to Sacriledges;
And that which exceeds all Expression: She chose rather to undergo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently
the shame and punishment of Adulterers, then to preserve her
Life and Honour by a Stain easie to be washed out, and far easier to be
concealed. Certainly the Victories of <hi>Sampson,</hi> though Heroick and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous,
if compared with these, will pass but for May-Games, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
And whatsover is said of it, he shewed less strength in tearing
up Pillars, and bearing the fall of a Ruined House, then <hi>Susanna</hi> did in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
her self to the snares which were prepared for her. Let us add now
Example to Discourse; and to Inculcate also to the Understanding the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage

the Vertues which make the Honour of her Sex; and even those which
Honour ours, were not wanting in her. She was very Beautiful, but far
more Chaste, and little less Valiant. She had Charms and accomplished
Graces: but those Charms were Innocent, and without Affectation: those

covered over with a certain dust steeped in sweat, which appeared like a
Military painting, and such as they give to Victory: A black and violent
flame suddenly seized on his heart: And the smoke thereof ascending to
his head, extinguished all that was found there of light. It was neither Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this Nature do not fasten on all sorts of matter: And although the Sun
doth illuminate Comets as well as the Planets; yet it is not from the fire
of Planets that he illuminates the Comets.</p>
                  <p>The relation which was made him of the Valour and Chastity of <hi>Blanche,</hi>
added new fire to his brutish Concupiscence; he was likewise by Nature
one of these lustful Devils, who are less lascivious by an appetite they
cannot have, then by the inclination they have to defile and corrupt.
Rapes and all debauchery, injurious to Vertue, were most pleasing to him;
And he took a particular delight in spoiling those Flowers which were
Consecrated to her. At first he constrain'd his Humour, and took upon
him a flattering and complacent Countenance; but this look was a very
improper Mask: And his rude and forc'd complacences were far from
softning the Vertue of <hi>Blanche.</hi> She knew very well that Tygers never
grow familiar in good earnest with their Prey, and that though they hide
their teeth and clawes, yet they seldom make much of them, without
scratching or biting them.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards he discovers himself, and declares to her his passion with
arrogant intreaties, and in a stile of Command. His intreaties, though
violent, finding not themselves powerful enough, he came to armed
threats, full of death and tortures: And his threats, with all their weapons,
proved as weak as his Intreaties. There nothing remain'd to try but force:
And as he prepared himself for it, the Chaste and Couragious <hi>Blanche</hi>
slipt out of his hands; got into the window, and transported by her Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and Courage, and perchance also by her good Angel, she precipitated
her self from thence. This boldness astonish'd all that were present: And
even <hi>Accidin</hi> acknowledg'd himself overcome by the fall of his Captive:
They that were sent to help her, believed her dead: She was only in a
swound, and had one shoulder out of joynt, and an arm broken. She
being come to her self, there was neither care not remedies spar'd for her
Cure: But as she apprehended more her Cure then death, the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
which asswaged the pain of her body, augmented the grief of her
minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and every moment she prayed against the Vertue of Remedies,
and bewailed the ease which she received by them. The Remedies had
notwithstanding more Vertue then either her Prayers or Tears: They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
her health, and the restauration thereof proved the <hi>Crysis</hi> of her
misfortune.</p>

                     <hi>Accidin</hi> no sooner saw her recovered, but he presently renewed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
and pursuits. He assaulted her Soul in every part, where it might
be assaulted. Having in vain contested against hope, he contested against
fear; And caused far greater Threats to succed larger Offers. But this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55122:135"/>
Assault found not a more prosperous Success then the former. His
great Menaces and Offers were tendred without effect; and there was
sound nothing base or weak in this great Soul. Perswasion not prevailing
with her, he used a Tyrannical and Barbarous Violence; and not being
able to gain upon the Spirit of <hi>Blanche,</hi> he caused her body to be fastened
upon a Table, which was more detestable to her then a Torturing
Wheel.</p>
                  <p>This action only sullied the Tyrant who did it; The Vertue of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
who endured it with so much regret, was not defaced by it: Her
very Name received not any stain thereby: Nevertheless being transported
with pain, and become odious, and almost unknown to her self; she
withdrew to the place in which her Husband Interr'd: Where having
discovered what remained of his body: where having made a short and
interrupted, yet Couragious and Manly Complaint to his Ghost; and
where having besought him to come and deliver her soul out of a Prison
stain'd by <hi>Accidin;</hi> she cast her self upon these dear and pittiful Reliques:
And in this state, able to beget Emulation in all the Vertuous Women of
Antiquity, she rendred up her Soul, not upon the Body of her Husband,
(who was no more) but upon his Shadow and Memory.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL England is dangerously sick upon this
Bed with Prince <hi>Edward.</hi> The Fortune of the
Publike being wounded to the heart by the
wound he brought from the Holy VVar, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
the same Convulsions as he feels: And
the Physitians give them but one day of life, if God send not
an Angel, and a Miracle to cure them.</p>
               <p>Surely it is very strange that the hearts of a whole Nation
should be wounded by one blow, and that one shaft which
hath hurt but one Body, should draw Blood from so many
Soules. But such is the condition, and as it were the destiny
of good Princes: They have a heart and soul in every one
of their Subjects: Their blood and veines disperse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
throughout all the parts of their Dominions, and their
least wounds are followed by publike Symptomes, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Maladies.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Edwards</hi> wound is one of those: The King his
Father, and all his Subjects lament it, and their Tears are the
Blood of their Soules, which have been wounded by his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
You will believe notwithstanding, that in this generall
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55122:137"/>
sickness, and amidst these common lamentations, the Princess
his wife is the most sick, and most to be lamented. There is
also a good half of the Prince in her; and reciprocally more
then a good half of her in the Prince. Her love at least is there
intire; and with her love there is more of her Life, and
more of her Soul then is left behind. Though far remote
from the fight, yet she was wounded there to death with
him: Her heart found it self just in the offended part: and
ever since her soul and life have issued forth by the same
wound with her Husbands blood.</p>
               <p>At present hope is returned to her, but it is a dolefull hope,
and such as may come from despair. The Physitians have
declared to her, that the Prince might yet be cured, and that
to cure him, it was necessary to seek out some affectionate
and couragious person, who would expose himself to take in
his Death by sucking the poyson out of his wound. Her
Love, which was present at the Consult of the Physitians,
perswaded her that this affection could not be expected but
from a woman, nor this Courage but from a Princes: That
this fatall wound could not have a more soveraign Salve then
her Tongue: and that if it were her Husbands destiny to
receive a second Life, he could owe it to no other then her
Spirit and Mouth.</p>
               <p>This inspiration greedily received by her heart, drew from
thence this bold and vigorous heat, and this tincture of hope
and joy which you see in her Face. There appears in her
Countenance something, I know not what, of fierce and
stately, which seems to require respect, and yet begets affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
It is peradventure a certain Ayr of Spain which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Seas with her, and followed her into England. It is
perchance a visible expression of her Heroick thoughts, and
an exteriour sign by which her Soul declares what she newly
concluded. For whatever this little fierceness may be taken,
and what name soever they give it; it sets a harmless edge
upon the sweetness of this Princess: It is to her Beauty and
Graces a modest and well-becoming boldness: It is as it
were a reflection of her Heart upon her Face, and as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55122:137"/>
of the greatness and vigour of her Soul.</p>
               <p>But whether it proceed from the greatness and vigour of
her Soul, or from the force and greatness of her affection, she
valueth not death, to which she is going to expose her self,
nor is affrighted at this great train of Terror which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
set before her; She considers, and hearkens to nothing
but her Love, which calls her to an action which will equall
Spain to ancient Greece, and old Italy; which will efface
the glory of renowned men and women; and infuse jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
into both Sexes: which will be the honour of this
Age, and the admiration of Posterity; and will manifest
that Charity no less then Faith hath the gift of Cures, and
the vertue of Miracles.</p>
               <p>Her Imagination was full of these great Objects. But her
Husband is the main one, and approacheth nearest to her
heart: In her mind she renounceth Reputation and Glory:
and by an express Oath taken upon the name and picture of
the Prince, which you see in her hand; She dedicates her self
to his Cure, and obligeth her self to suck in her own Death,
or to give him Life. Let us accompany her to the Execution
of this business, and place our selves behind this piece of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras
with the Princes servants, who observe her in silence, and
with gestures of astonishment. Vertue cannot have too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
witnesses in like Enterprizes. And this would merit that
time past should return, and the future advance to convey to
her Spectators of all Ages.</p>
               <p>Behold her already upon the Princes Bed, and couched
upon the wound she hath discovered. You would say that
her Soul to accomplish the Transport she hath vowed, and
to pass from the subject she animates, to that she loveth,
flows away by her Eyes with her Tears, and drop by drop
penetrates the Body of the sick Prince. Do not fear that these
Tears should inflame his wound; or that the Ardour of his
Feavour be augmented by them. These Tears indeed are
very warm, and come from a scorching spring: but they are
gentle and benigne; and I believe that not a Tear doth fall,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55122:138"/>
which carryeth not with it some part of the Princesses Soul,
and some drop of her Life distilled therein.</p>
               <p>VVhat do you think of this Love, who exhorts her with
his very looks and action? Doth he not seem to be newly
come out of her Heart to declare himself the Author of this
great Design, and to enjoy it neerer and in an open way? He
is not one of these Interested and Propriatory Ones that will
ingross all to themselves, and aym meerly at their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
satisfaction. Less also is he one of those Discontented
and Contentious Ones, who are armed on all sides with
teeth and nails; who carry not a Flower which is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Thornes; who make not so much cleer fire,
as they do noise and smoke.</p>
               <p>You see no Shafts nor Torch about him, because he is a
Saving and no Tyrannical Love: He is come to cure an
old wound, and not to make new ones: And there entreth
nothing but a pure Spirit and Light into the Flames which
he inkindles. He is not of the Country of Romances, nor
of the Region of Fables: His Origen is from Heaven, even
from the most Luminous, and highest part of Heaven. He
is next to God the Mediator of holy Marriages, and well
united Pairs: He is the common Spirit of Christian Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathyes,
and the Moderator of Chaste Agreements, and
Vertuous Harmonies.</p>
               <p>Such an Exhorter is most powerful, and his Inspirations
leave nothing to be acted by Reason. However he is not
the sole perswader of the Princess. Her Husband though
fast asleep, is no less Perswasive nor Eloquent them he. If
Prince <hi>Edward</hi> speaks not with his mouth, he speaks by the
paleness of his face: He speaks from the Ardour of his Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and the Palpatation of his heart. He speaks from
his wound which hath a Voice of Blood and words of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
In silence the Princess yields attention to this Voice
and to these VVords: And Answereth them with her
Sighs and Tears, which are no less Eloquent, nor less Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate.
And ere long when she shall thrust her Tongue
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55122:138"/>
and Mouth into this VVound, her Heart will descend upon
her Lips to bid the last adieu to the Princes Heart, and to
transmit into it her last Flame, together with her Life.</p>
               <p>But fear nothing in her behalf: This Love her Inciter, will
preserve them both. He put a secret Antidote in to her
Mouth, and gave her Spirit the gift of Healing. Her
Lips which he purified with a Spiritual and Sacred Fire,
will Exorcise Death, and dispossess it of this Body,
without taking it into her own: And one day, <hi>Edward</hi>
Cured, and <hi>Eleonor</hi> Preserved, will be reckoned amongst
the miracles of Heroick Charity.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Eroick Vertue doth not alwaies Kill; not imploys Fire and
Sword in all she takes in hand. All her Exploits are not
stained with Blood: she knows how to perform them of
more then one fashion and colour; and acts not everywhere
with Noise, though in every place with Force. There are
Obscure victories without witnesses, wherein she hath need of no less
boldness, then in those which are gained in the view of whole Nations,
and with the noise of Canons and Trumpets.</p>
                  <p>The victorie represented in this Picture, is one of these. <hi>Edward,</hi> Prince
of <hi>Wales,</hi> was come back from the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> with a wound he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from an Impoysoned Arrow. The Physitians had allayed all their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
and practises, and all those ways having been unprofitably tryed,
they declared to him, that he could not be cured but by the destruction of
some Person who might have the courage to suck in death with the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his wound. Being condemned by this Declaration, he prepares
himself to dye, resolving not to preserve life, by the death of another, nor
to make a remedy of an Impoysonment. The Princess his Wife, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
unto the King of <hi>Castile,</hi> conceiving her self condemn'd by the
same sentence, received it, as if love it self had pronounced it to her: And
seeing her self necessitated to dye, either by the death or cure of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
She resolved to chuse of these two deaths, that which seemed to her
the most Honourable, and least bitter; and which ought of the two moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of her life to conserve to her self, that which was most dear and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>This resolution taken with her love, she defers the Execution to the
next night; And as soon as the Prince was prepared for it by rest, she
gently discovers his wound, and begins to cure it by the purest blood of
her soul, which she pours into it with her Tears: That done, she set her
mouth to the wound, and with her tongue plunged her heart into it: By
little and little she sucks out the Poyson, and so seasonably casts it forth, as
she drew from thence all that was Mortal, without ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ning any part
thereof to her self.</p>
                  <p>Whether that this malignant humour were consumed by the subtile and
penetrating fire, which her heart diffused by her mouth: Or whether
God, who is Life and Charity, had laid his Spirit upon her lips, she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
her Husbands life without loosing her own; and by one act cured
two sick Persons, and wrought two Miracles.</p>

married Women This couragious <hi>Spaniard</hi> added to the <hi>Romans, Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,</hi>
and even to those <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who dyed for their husbands, will speak
Eternally for the constancy and fidelity of their Affections: And wil highly
prove, and in an Heroick fule, that the loving portion of the heart is more
vigorous and couragious in their Sex, then in Ours. But she will also prove
for their instruction, that nothing is impossible to well ordered Charity:
That her hands have the gift of Cures, and that the vertue of Miracles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
on her Lips: That she single and unarmed, hath more Force then
Death with all his swords and poysons: and that Barbarous and heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Love, which knew onely how to dye vainly, and with Audacity, was
but an impatient and desperate Love, compared to a Chaste One, which
knows how to save in dying, and to reap benefit even by its Dangers and
Losses.</p>
                  <p>But this saving and Wonder-working Love, ought not to be a busie and
Effeminate Love, or a Love of Interest and propriety. It must be a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
and Couragious Love, Extatick and Prodigal; Elevated above all
that pleaseth and affrights. This Torch must be like that, represented in the
<hi>Canticles,</hi> not a wandring and Volatile fire, but a fire ever Equal and Active;
A fire which consumes all the little threds of Interests; all Forraign tyes;
all Chains and Fetters; even those precious Chains which Fortune frames;
nay, those very Fetters which are more worth then Diadems, and which
fasten Princes on Thrones. Some will have it, that it consumes even the
tyes of the Soul and Body; And alleadge that place of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> where
the power of Love is equalled with that of Death. This point is
both important, and instructive: And because one might be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously
mistaken therein, it is fit to make a Question of it apart.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Whether it appertains to the Duty and Fidelity of VVomen, to
expose themselves to Death for their Husbands.</head>
                  <p>IF in this point we believe Antiquity, Conjugal Love was heretofore
very Tyrannical: And married Women, who subjected themselves to
it, ought to be well resolved. It was not satisfied, that they should bear
with the ill humours, and bad Fortunes of their Husbands, but it would
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55122:140"/>
have them sick of their Maladies, &amp; die of their Deaths: And as if it had not
been sufficient to make them slaves, &amp; undergo the yoke, It made them also
Sufferers and Victims, and put ordinarily either a rope about their necks, or
a dagger in their throats: The chief thing is, that there was a necessity of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that course to acquire the title of a gallant Woman: And such as were
able to endure life after the death of their Husbands, could not pretend to
the acclamations of their present Age, nor to the Eternity of History. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
even in these dayes this cruel Custom is used in some parts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
No Widows are seen in those Countries: And Families are not prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
there by Dowries which issue out of them: A Father of a Family being
dead, the Law of the Country ordains, that he be put in an Equipage for
the other World: And that such things as had been most dear unto him,
should be burn'd with him. The best beloved of his Wives hath this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by his last Will, and the Right which Custom allows her. She
dresseth her self more richly, and with more care for death, then she had
done for her Wedding-Feast: The whole Kindred in Festival Garments,
and adorned like her, Conducts her Solemnly and in Pomp to the flaming
Pile: And there she suffers her self to be burnt in Ceremony, and with a
more Natural and less affected Constancy then did the <hi>

who would counterfeit <hi>Hercules</hi> dying; And presented a Spectacle of his
death to the Army of <hi>Alexander.</hi> I know indeed that this Superstitious,
and regular Cruelty of the Indians; And that other tumultuary and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated
Despair of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> are equally reproved by the
Laws of Christianity. But I am not ignorant also that conjugal Love hath
its Meritorious and Vertuous Deaths: And there is some ground to doubt
whether such kinde of deaths may happen by way of obligation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Duty of a good Wife.</p>
                  <p>To this Question, which is not of meer Curiosity, but Instructive and
Profitable: I answer, First, that desperate and passionate Women, who kill
themselves to follow their deceased Husbands, transgress against conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Love, and violate the Fidelity they owe them. This Proposition draws
neer to a Paradox; Yet exceeds not its bounds; and Truth is there well
ballanced. One or two Reasons may Justifie it, and draw the assent of
the most devoted to the Memory of the <hi>Pant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="5 letters">

                     </hi> and the <hi>Porcia's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the first place it will be granted me, that the prime care of Lovers
should be to nourish their fire, and to keep it still in heat and action; To
delend it from all that might extinguish it: And the least neglects therein
are Temptations: Doubts are Dispositions to change and commenced In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelities.
Now this fire is smother'd in blood, and by the violence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Widows. It is a great folly to believe that nothing remains after
death: The earth of Church-yards is too cold to preserve a single spark
thereof: An such as thunder out so great Oaths, that their Ashes will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
everlastingly the heat thereof, are highly guilty of Perjury, unless
they vent them by way of Poesie. And if it be an act of Infidelity by
tract of time, and by piece-meal to suppress ones love from day to day,
and to deprive it by degrees of nourishment, what will it be to smother it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55122:141"/>
violently and on a sudden; not to leave it a single spark which may
inkindle it?</p>
                  <p>I know not how they will take what I have to say in this particular. It
is true nevertheless, and must be spoken, in what sense soever it may be
taken Conjugal Fidelity is more hainously violated, and the dead are far
more injured by the delusive Courage of the falsely Constant Women that
destroy themselves, then by the weakness of those which will open their
hearts to new Affections, and run to second Marriages. These at least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Memory of their Husbands; They still retain their Rings on
their Fingers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They keep their Pictures in their Closets and Hearts: And
the second fire which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>eth on them is not so incompatible, nor so much
an enemy to the first, that it permits not some sparks thereof, and a little
heat in the remaining Ashes. On the contrary, furious and despairing Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
in what manner soever they voluntarily die, reserve nothing of their
first fire: They destroy it even to the Matter, to the very Ashes and Harth:
And their Husbands, who might live long and quietly in their hearts, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
a second time by the impetuosity of their Despair, or by the obstinacy
of their Grief.</p>
                  <p>Hence I infer a second Reason against the Falsity of impatient and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing
Love. It is an opinion generally received, and supported both
by the Sense and Nature, as well as by Speculation and Philosophy: That
Persons beloved have a particular Being, and as it were a second Existency
in the Imagination, in the Soul and Heart of the Persons that love them.
They live there intellectually, and by their Images: And those Images are
not dead Figures, nor Impostures of a deceiving Art. They have Life and
Spirit; they are true and Natural: They possess all the Perfections and
Graces of their Originals, and have neither the Defects nor stains of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Now a Woman who kills her self out of a blinde and precipitious fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or who consumes her self with an obstinate and voluntary Affliction,
takes from her Husband this second Existency; and this intellectual Being
and Love, by which he surviv'd himself She voluntarily annihilates, and
violently destroys that which death had left her: And if she ought to
make a scruple of defacing his Picture, with what colour and pretence
can she justifie the violence she offereth to an Image, which was her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Life and Felicity in this World?</p>
                  <p>It is evident thereby that Constancy is not furious, and that Fidelity is
another thing then Despair: That the greatest Love is not that which
makes the most haste to poysons and precipices: That Wives cannot more
Religiously keep the Faith they owe to their Husbands, not give them
stronger proofs of their Affection, then in rendring their Fidelity, and Love,
durable and lasting: Then in procuring them in their minde a life full of
tranquillity and satisfaction: Then in espousing their Memory, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a new Contract with their Images: Then in carefully preserving
those things which have been dear unto them: And if they be good Wives,
they will not doubt but they were more dear to them then any World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treasure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:55122:141"/>
Let it not be said, that this Philosophy is too remiss and indulgent:
That it pleads the cause of Nice and Effeminate Dames; That it gives cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and authority to self Love. This cannot be spoken but rashly, and at
random; And surely as one may kill himself out of self Love, and through
an excess of tenderness; so one may preserve his own life for the Love of
another, and by a particular Effort of Courage. <hi>Seneca</hi> affirms, that for
this much Vertue is required: and that the bravest men ought to employ
therein, the whole vigour of their Souls. And this <hi>Stoack,</hi> who was as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
by his own inclination, as by the Genius of his Sect; who had been
inured to the Axioms, and opinions of the strongest Philosophy; who had
so frequent trials of himself against grief and death, freely confesseth, and
in good earnest, that he was become a thrifty dispoler of his bad remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and had spared the dirt and dreggs of his Old Age, to the end
he might preserve the Spirit and youth of <hi>Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s,</hi> who lived in him.</p>
                  <p>To this first Decision, Which allows not to Women the use of poyson,
and Steel; and imposeth an absolute necessity on them to survive their
husbands; I add a second, which replaceth them in the freedom, even in
the Right and Duty of dying for them: And the strength of this second
Decision, is not repugnant to the moderation of the former. I say then,
that albeit the Law, which forbids murther, and especially all self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
be express and general: Yet in a perilous occasion, where the life of
a husband should be in danger, his wife would be obliged to expose her
self for him to this hazard, and to give her own life for the preservation of
his, if there were an occasion of making this exchange. I do not ground
this obligation upon the right of Common Justice, nor on the Duties of
Charity in general. Common, and Universal Charity, doth not extend
so far: I ground it upon the Right and Duties of Conjugal Love, which
is of greater rigour, then the most rigorous justice, and imposeth more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
and strict Laws, then the strictest Charity.</p>
                  <p>And to begin with what is more particular and essential: We know
that the proper effect, &amp; the specifical Function of Conjugal Love, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite
two Moyties, which the Creation hath severed: and to reassemble
Man and Woman into one body. Moreover we see in all Natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that the less Noble parts expose themselves by instinct to fire and
sword, in the defence of the Nobler. We see that the Arms and Hands
stuffen and extend themselves to meet the danger which menaceth the
head; to receive the blows directed against it: To protect it even by their
wounds, even by their death and torture, What our Members do by
this instinct, which is a more ancient duty then all Laws &amp; Law makers,
which is a blinde Love, and a Natural Charity without merit; a married
Woman ought to do it freely, and by election, through the duty
of this strict and rigorous Charity, which Conjugal Love imposeth on her.
She is but the second part of the body, composed by marriage. Man, to
whom the Command belongs, is the Head thereof: and the Law which
from the begining was imposed upon Woman, to apply her self to this
Head, not onely ordains her to take light and Conduct from thence, but
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55122:142"/>
also wils, that to preserve this principle of her Conduct, and this source
of her light, she should lay aside the care of her own safety, and repose:
that she should take upon her self his dangers and wounds; and even save
him by her death, if it will be received in Exchange.</p>
                  <p>Besides, Love of its own Nature is a general Alienation of the whole
Person that loveth. It is a Transport without Contract or Hope of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
by which one gives himself all entire, and makes a free Donation
of all that he hath, and is, to the Person he affects. Now if this Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Transport may be valid and of force in any kinde of love, it is
doubtless in Conjugal Love, which leaves no right of reserve in Married
Persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which takes from them even the free use of their Bodies, and
engageth them in a mutual Dependency. And this Dependency is yet
more strict and indispensible on the Wives part, who owes unto her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
even the hairs of her Head, and the very Dreams and Fancies which
are within it: Whether by Reason the subjection is greater, and the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
more Natural and necessary of the Body towards the Head, and of the
Accessory toward the Principal, then of the Head towards the Body, and
the Principal towards the Accessory; or whether because Wives give
themselves with less reserve, and love more Sincerely, and with more Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
then Men This Alienation, when it is free and compleat, doth
not only establish on a Husband a just Title over all the Cares and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Wife; but it also establishes in him, a new Right over her
Blood and Life. And albeit, this Right cannot be exacted by Justice, yet
it may be done by Love, which is a far less severe and vexatious Exacter,
but yet more pressing and more efficatious then Justice. Nevertheless this
Exacter ought to know, that he cannot make use of this Right but in the
Extremity of Hope, and after the Tryal of all other Remedies. An arm
of a Man is not cut off to cure him of Rhume and Head-ach: And one
may say truly, that this kinde of Love would play the Tyrant, and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner,
and even cut the throat of a Wife, to make a Bath for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
sick of the Sciatica or the Stone.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, Love is a true and sensible Transmigration of the
Soul, or as some define it, grounded on the Doctrine of St. <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ys:</hi> It is
an Extasie by which the Soul ceaseth to live in the Body, which she ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
to live in that which she Loves. Upon which it is not necessary to
make a Commentary in this place; nor to say by way of gloss, that the
Word to live ought not to be understood of the first and Substantial, but of
the second and Active Life; of this sweet and sensible Life, which affords
Gust and Delight to the first. Every one ought to know, that Love is
the Original, and, as it were, the Fountain of Joy, Pleasure and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and of whatsoever hath a share in the sweetness of Life: And
therefore the sweet life of Lovers cannot subsist, but in the place where
they love: Their minds are sick and languishing, every where else: All
their thoughts, which tend not thither, are heavy and Terrestrial; are
Melancholy and burthened with Anxiety: Their Musings and their
Cares can follow no other Track: And of those Souls, it may well be
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55122:142"/>
said that they are Aliens, and Incommodated at home; And that their
Bodies are to them as bad Innes, nay Prisons and Sepulchres.</p>
                  <p>Hence it grows, that it doth not only belong to the Duty, but also to the
Interest and Repose of a good Wife, to Sacrifice her own life for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
and that the gain which may be made thereby, is by two thirds
greater then the loss. Thereby she only hazards the most unquiet and
worst part of her two lives. She exposeth nothing but her Sorrows and
Vexations, for the preservation of her Joyes and Pleasures. Of the two
places where her Soul lives, she only forsakes that which is sad and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy:
And by the ruine of her Prison, she secures her Palace. And
that by the choice of a death which lasts but a moment, and is sweetned
and purified by Love; She avoids a Widow-hood, which is to Lovers
a long and bitter death; A death of the Heart and Minde; a death which
endures and makes it self felt as long as it lasteth. Thereby in fine, her
Love enjoys the purest and highest satisfaction whereof it is capable:
Which is to produce it self entire: To fill up the whole Extent that lies
open to it; to pass even to the utmost bounds, and to the last Tryals.
Now so long as it advanceth not so far as death, there still remains a great
<hi>Vac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

wanting to Tryals. Being assured by the Testimony of Holy Writ, that
Perfect and Consummated Love, is only found in such as Sacrifice their
Lives for those who are dear unto them.</p>

                  <p>IT is no new thing to hear me Discourse of the bad Intelligence which
is between Friendship and Fortune It hath always been believed
that Greatness was too much Interessed, and Propriatory, to love real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and that it had a certain Pride and Rigour, which left no room for
Tenderness and soft Passions. It hath been said, that Love and Majesty
never dwell together: That it rather affects a mean and quiet Condition,
then an elevation exposed to Winds and Tempests. And they that have
resembled it to a Bird, have not made it flie with Eagles, nor placed it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the top of Cedars, and the summet of Mountains. They have rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it amongst Bees, which are Armed, and live like it, of the quintiscence
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

amongst Rose Trees, where there is Fire and Thorns like its own. But
whatever hath hitherto been believed or said, Friendship and Vertue are
not equally at variance with all great Fortunes: There are Grandeurs very
Affectionate and wel-Natured, as well as Rude and Intractable. And if
the Lizard, which walks only upon his hands, as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, be so bold
as to ascend even to the Palaces of Kings, and to dwell with them as their
Domestique: We must not believe that Love, which is Nobly Descended,
and to whom so excellent wings are given, is only born for Cottages.
There are no Houses shut against it: And it shall appear by this Example,
into what House soever Vertue introduceth it, there is no Greatness which
gives not place to it, nor any Interest which obeys it not.</p>

throughout all <hi>France:</hi> It was likewise Extraordinary and Wonderful;
and there was not only colour in the pieces which composed it, but also
Force and Solidity; they were all great and Illustrious. In my Judgement

of all those pieces; nay, the strongest and most solid, though it lasted
not so long as the rest This great Lady possessed in an eminent degree
all the Qualities which may conduce to the glory of a Family, and the
happiness of a Husband. Her Nobility was of the first rank: And I
know not whether in all <hi>Europe</hi> there were any Soveraign Title or Crown
wherein she had not a share. But there is a Nobility which is proud and
insolent; yet hers was Modest and Civil: The Titles of her House did not
puff up her Mind And the Crowns of her Allies and Predecessors made her
not receive others with scorn. To this Nobleness of Blood was added the
Nobleness of her Countenance, and that Soveraignty of Natural Right and
Ancient Descent, which begets Majesty in Beautiful Persons; but she was
not of those fair Ones who erect their Soveraignty into Liberty and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
Hers still remained within the limits of a lowly and exemplar So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety.
Detraction, which is so bold in lying, and findes out stains
in the most Beautiful Planets, had not one word to say against her.</p>

                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:55122:143"/>
Nevertheless, her Vertue was no sullen Vertue; she was none of those
curst ones, who have not a drop of good nature; who know onely how
to scratch and bite: She was naturally milde, and cultivated by study<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the Graces had so well tempered what might perchance have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                        </gap>leme,</hi> to bring him alive or dead: The execution of
this dangerous Plot was defer'd till the tenth of August, and that day the
Magistrate, who was not ignorant how hard a chase he had to follow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
himself with two hundred selected and armed men to seiz on the
Duke at the hour he should go forth to hear Mass. I know not whether
one ought to believe what is spoken of his good Fortune: but indeed I
have heard say, That she was more diligent about him, then the most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of his Guards: And that his enemies never laid any s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ares to catch
him, which she did not break asunder; that they never prepared a Pitfall
for him, over which she laid not a Plank. However it were, it is certain,
there had been an end of him that day, if she had not caused dispatches to
arrive to him, which busied him very happily all the morning, and divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him from going forth to expose himself to death, which was prepared
for him.</p>
                  <p>The occasion passing over with the morning, the Conductors of the
Enterprize resolved to begin by the seisure of a rich pawn; and to secure
the Dukes Person, by laying hold on the good Lady, his Wife, who was at
Mass. Mean while, one of the Magistrates, accompanied with twelve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and stout men, entered the Castle: Their Arms were hid under
their Cloaks; but their bad Intention being easie to be discovered by their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55122:144"/>
ill looks, one of his Guards had some distrust of them, and ran to shut the
Gate against those that followed to second them: the party began hotly
to discharge their Pistols before the Dukes Chamber: some of his friends
overpowred with number, were slain in the place: but his Domesticks
and Guards hasting to the noise, and he himself appearing with a Sword in
his hand, the end of the Pray proved as unhappy for the Assailants, as the
beginning. The Magistrate, and one of the boldest amongst his Troop,
made Payment for the attempt, with their persons; and the rest who were
not resolved to lose so much, rendred up their Arms, and abandoned the
party.</p>
                  <p>This first Troop being defeated, the Duke was not for all that out of
danger. He was enforced to defend the two Gates of the Castle against fire
and the Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

danger, nevertheless, was in the Church, where furiously entred an
armed, and incensed multitude, which seized on the Dutchess. Her quality
and Sex deserved at least some respect: but qualities are not distinguished
in a Tumult; and no Sex is Priviledged against Fury. Of two Gentlemen
that led her, one was killed at her feet, and the other being dangerously
wounded, was in little better condition. This Barbarous Act did not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
her: the bloud which sprinkled her Gown, and Death it self, which
passed over her, wrought no change in her Countenance. Her soul was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
Erect, and Elevated above danger; She conserved even the comliness
of her gesture, and the dignity of her looks, even words of Authority, and
tone of Command: and whereas another less Couragious Woman, might
have submitted to Insolency, and have flattered Fury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She treated them with
Command, like a Mistress, astonishing Audacity it self by her Constancy.</p>
                  <p>They advertise her that she was Arrested for her Husband; and that if
she had a mind to live, and preserve Him, she must consider of disposing
him to remit his Person and Cittadel into the hands of the Magistrate.</p>
                  <p>At this Declaration, which was made to her with threats, and a dagger
at her throat, she answered, <q>That she would not enter into any Treaty
with Murtherers: That she knew not how to give ill Counsels: nor
in what terms a Wise may perswade her Husband to be a Coward: that
it troubled her she had but one life to expose for the honour and safety
of his: that she was so far from lending them her prayers and tears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, that she would joyfully shed even the last drop of her bloud,
if that might add either a moment of new lustre to his reputation, or half
a days space to his life: And therefore let their fury finish on her, what
it had begun. That nothing of weakness should proceed either from her
mouth or hands, that they too well accorded with her heart; and that it
would better please her to dye at the Castle Gate for her Husband,
then to live without him upon a Throne.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>She made large promises; she found her self also as well disposed to
make good what she promised; and her Constancy being put to the Test,
was found as great and vigorous as her words. I learned from an Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Person, and who hath narrowly looked into the affairs of that time,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55122:144"/>
that she was brought before the Castle; and that they might there take the
Husband by the fear and danger of the Wife, the same Propositions were
renewed to her, with the same Threats and Violencies.</p>
                  <p>The Couragious Woman reduced to this Extremity, considered nothing
but the danger of her husband; and had no fear, but of his Affection and
Tenderness. She was not ignorant that all his weakness lay on that side:
and that there was no place so strong, which would not be hard for him to
defend against her tears: She also cryed out unto him, the better to fortifie
this weak part: <q>That she came not to perswade him to a dangerous
Piety; and to betray him by her Intreaties: That she came rather to
make her Body serve him for a new Barricado against his Enemies. That
if he loved her truly, and had a desire to save her, he should love and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
what was of her in him; that on him depended her safety and
danger; her good and bad Fortune: that out of him, she could have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life nor death, nothing to hope or fear; that he should take heed of
trusting Traytors, who assaulted his head by his heart: who would sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it to his overthrow, and raise a Compassion in him, to gain his life at
a cheaper rate: that he should beware of listening to the suggestions of
a Timerous and Apprehensive Love: that he should rather give ear to
that Affection which spake to him by her mouth: that it were lost la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to preserve her, if he lost himself: that it would be of no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to his Enemies to destroy her, if he were safe: that in despight of
them, and what death soever they should make her suffer, she should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
live most happy, as long as she should live in his remembrance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>She pronounced these words with so Graceful a Confidence, and so
Noble and Generous a Tone, as it clearly appeared, that at this instant her
heart ascended to her mouth to express it self by its own Language. This e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Vertue dazel'd the furious Souldiers, who environed her, and made
their Weapons fall out of their hands. The Duke was relieved by his frinds,
who came thither from <hi>Xaintes,</hi> and <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>gnae:</hi> And the Capitulation being
concluded between him and the Inhabitants, the Dutchess, impatient to see
him again, could not expect till the Castle Gate was cleared, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a Ladder whereby to enter at the window. Certainly after so Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
and Glorious a Victory, it had been fit the Gate should have been
thrown down before her, and that she should have entred the Castle in
Triumph, and by a Breach.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AD you known that this day was to be a day
of Miracle and Safety to <hi>France;</hi> and that you
should have assisted at the most Heroick action
which hath been ever seen, since Sieges and
Battles have been in use; you would be sorry
to have come too late: But here is yet enough to give you
a right prospect thereof. The adventure is wonderfull in all
its Parts; there is something great and prodigious in all its
Circumstances: And that which remains for us to see, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
by much, whatever can be regularly imagined, and
with any true resemblance.</p>
               <p>You are no strangers to this Country, and need not learn
from me to know <hi>Orleans</hi> by her Steeples, and the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of her VValls. Likewise you are not ignorant of the
Constancy and Fidelity which this great City had shewed,
when it was besieged by the <hi>English,</hi> and reduced to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of hope. But that which you do not yet know, and
what no man dares hope for, is, that in despite of the <hi>English,</hi>
and in the very sight of their Camp and VVorks, Succours,
safety and liberty hapned to enter into this Place, under the
Conduct of a <hi>Maide.</hi> Not only hope was not so bold as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55122:146"/>
to advance so far; but even belief it self, fortified by the
sight, hath much ado to reach unto it.</p>
               <p>Yea as a Maide, even a Country Maide, and a Sheper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess,
hath wrought this so little expected Miracle. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
is, that this Country Maide is a Prophetess; and
that this yesterdayes Sheperdess is to day the Generall of an
Army, and will be to morrow a Conqueress. The same God
who loosned from the Mountain the little Stone wherewith
the great <hi>Colossus</hi> was overturned, who drew from amidst
stocks of Sheep a youth victorious over Lions and Gyants,
made choice of this <hi>Maide</hi> to force <hi>France</hi> out of the hands of
strangers, and sent her to the King loaden with VVarlike
Commands, and promises of Victory.</p>
               <p>The King, by the advice of his Counsell, after an exact
and juridicall Inquisition into her life and words, furnished
her with Arms and Troops, to chase away the English be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Oreleans.</hi> She but now forced their Camp with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Lances: and behold her already with Victory and
safety at the Gates of the City. This first prosperous Action
is an efficacious and famous justification of her Innocence;
It is a powerfull and victorious answer to false Rumours, and
passionate Calumny: And suddenly the Coronation of the
King followed by the totall defeat of the Enemy, will be a
more solemn and authenticall proof of the authority of her
Mission, and of the verity of her Prophesies.</p>
               <p>I could wish that we had seen her in the heat of Fight
handle her first Arms by Efforts of consummated Valour.
But if we are come too late to be spectators of this Valour, to
behold the lightnings, and impetuosity of this Heroick fire,
which gave an action so lively to her Arms, and so sudden
motions to her whole Body; we may at least discern the
light thereof upon her Face; and a remnant of hear which
still excites not with so much violence as before, but with
more dignity and due proportion. Combat and Victory
have left a pleasing mixture of a scarlet dye upon her Cheeks,
and on her Brow: and the spirits of boldness receive a kind
of sweetness from thence, and a new Grace from the spirits
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55122:146"/>
of joy, which were mingled with them. Nothing of the
ayr of her Birth, nor of the manners of her Education is seen
in her. There is nothing even in her Countenance but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
Noble and VVarlike: And this sudden Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis
which is made in her, from a Sheperdess into an <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,</hi>
hath something, I know not what, which resembles an
Illusion, and savors of a Prodigy and Fable.</p>
               <p>VVould you say that the very thoughts of grazing, and
the inclinations of a Sheperdess had ever entred into this
head, which is so free and gracefull under an Helmet?
VVould you say that the Sheep-hook had hitherto the
charge and imployment of these hands which handle so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously,
and with so much dexterity the Banner and
Sword? VVould you not say that she is born in a Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
of Arms, and that she is trained up in a Camp? That
she is come to us from the Countrey of <hi>Amazons?</hi> That
she is animated with the same Spirit which animated hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Hipolita's,</hi> the <hi>Rodoguna's,</hi> and the <hi>Zenobia's?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of saying it. This were to praise her injuriously, and
to dishonour her in handsome Termes: This were to scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
Innocence, and prophane a Person whom God hath
particularly Consecrated.</p>
               <p>The Spirit which possesseth her is another Spirit then that
of the <hi>Zenobiars,</hi> and <hi>Rodoguna's:</hi> It comes farther off then
the Countrey of <hi>Amazons:</hi> It is of a much purer and higher
Region. You have heard some discourse of that double Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which inspired <hi>Debora</hi> with Truth and Valour, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
replenished the two parts of her double <hi>Ministery:</hi> Of
this double <hi>Spirit,</hi> which was a <hi>Spirit</hi> of Fire to <hi>David</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
and a <hi>Spirit</hi> of Light to <hi>David</hi> a Prophet. It is the
same <hi>Spirit</hi> which descended upon our <hi>Maide;</hi> which filled
her with his Light and Heat; which gave her the science of
Predictions, and the vertue of Victories.</p>
               <p>The Sword which you see in her hand, makes me remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that <hi>Meteor</hi> with two Faces, that famous and mysterious
Fire which an Angel-conducter carryed before the People
of God. Like that <hi>Meteor,</hi> it is luminous, and stained with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55122:147"/>
Blood; like that <hi>Meteor,</hi> it summons on the one side safety and
liberty, and on the other side it threatens death and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Nevertheless it hath not like that a light only for shew;
Its splendor is not presaging: It were inconsiderable, if like
Lightning, it wounded nothing but the sight; it ruines and
destroyes like Thunder: And they say also, that like Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it was drawn out of the bosome of the Earth. For this
Sword, if you know it not, is a fatal Sword, and resuscitated
by Miracle: It belonged to another Age then this: And
the <hi>Maide</hi> divinely inspired, caused it to be taken out of an
ancient Tomb, where it rested quietly with the Ashes of its
old Master. Scarce had it felt the vertue of this glorious
hand, but the agedness thereof fell off with its Rust. It hath
received a new lustre, which gives it a new force, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
life: and behold it already stained with the Blood of
strangers, and throughly heated with this first prosperity.</p>
               <p>Two hundred Lanciers march bravely, and in an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
order after this <hi>Maide.</hi> Had Fortune her self, or Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
led the Party, they could not have done more gallantly,
nor given more terror to the Enemy. To behold the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and boldness of their looks: To behold this Noble
and couragious joy, which appears on their Faces, and in all
their motions, you would not say that they intend to cast
themselves into a beleagured City, but that they rather
march to some Triumph. The enemies still affrighted by the
impetuosity wherewith they passed along, retreated disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into their Forts, conceiving that it would not be safe for
them to remain in their Tents.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless the number of those that have no longer
any need of Tents or VVorks, is great enough. And appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
if the landed Troops had given on at the same time
upon all sides, this dayes work had put an end to the Siege:
And this so stately Camp, which had been for seven moneths
the Prison of <hi>Orleans,</hi> would become at present the Sepulchre
of a good part of <hi>England.</hi> But so great a work well deserved
to be shewn distinctly and at leisure: And to the end this
imprisoned and despairing City might behold all the Valour
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55122:147"/>
of its <hi>Deliveress,</hi> it was necessary that its Prison should not be
broken but by track of time, and by parcels.</p>
               <p>This happy beginning is a certain presage of a far more
fortunate Issue. And the Earl of <hi>Dunois,</hi> whom you see un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gate with <hi>Lahire</hi> and the other Commanders, is gone
forth to congratulate with her aforehand. Peradventure
you may have never seen the face of this young Prince:
You have never then beheld the greatest Ornament of this
Age, and the fairest hope of Posterity. Take time to observe
him well; Behold his gracefull carriage, and the dignity of
his whole Person; Behold those Rayes of Majesty, which
have something, I know not what, of Royal, and are dyed
with the Purple of his Blood. Behold the Nobleness of
Aspect, and ayr of a VVarriour, which demonstrates his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
Courage, and his remarkable Valour, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that he adds much to the name of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
supports the Greatness and Fortune thereof. It is hoped
that his Vertues will not die with him: They will serve for
other Ages, and under other Reigns: And all Predictions
are false, and Physiognomy is deceitfull, or Princes shall be
born from him, who will be <hi>Heroes</hi> by Race, and Valiant
from Father to Son; who will be one day the Honour of
their Family, by rendring Honour to <hi>France.</hi>

Fancy. She is not composed of the same Matter with those Valiant Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
set forth in Romances, and by Poets. Her Vertue was Sensible and
Substantial: She really effected in the Field all that others have done in
Picture, and in the brain of their Inventors: Her Victories have not been

not before her: Their Fortune, which conceived it self already Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
gave way to her Angel; and what forcible endeavours soever they
used to hinder her entry into <hi>Orleans,</hi> she entred it in despite of them, and
deprived them of <hi>France</hi> by taking this City from them.</p>
                  <p>After several Fights, wherein she was still Victorious, she fell into the
hands of her Enemies, who treated her as a Criminal both in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

Sorcerers. God was pleased thus to permit it, to the end she might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish

of Men: And we see few places where this difference is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
and better marked out, then in the History of the Maid of
<hi>Orleans.</hi> God drew her out of a Village, to inform us, that he makes no
distinction either of places or names: that he esteems not men for their
Coats of Arms, and ancient Titles: that the blood of a Prince and a
Shepherd, are of the same colour and matter: That a Sheep-hook in
his sight, is of the same value as a Scepter: And that both high and low,
as well as the Palme and Bush, spring from the same Earth. He chose
her out of a weak Sex; because he hath ever loved to overcome Pride by
Weakness; to throw down <hi>Colosseses</hi> with grains of Sand, to fell Giants
with Reeds. He would manifest, that the weakest and least Warlike
hands are able to defend Scepters, and support Thrones when he hath
blessed them: that the safety of States depends upon his Providence, and
not in the hands of Armies, nor on the heads of their Ministers. And
to teach Conquerours, that Victories are gained more by his Favour then
by their Forces, it was his good pleasure that a Shepherdesse, who had
never handled but a Sheep-hook, should give more then ten times chase to
above ten thousand Lances. In fine, God was pleased that a Maid,
bred up in a Village, should perform all the Functions of Heroick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
that she should undergo all the Trials, and obtain all the Crowns
thereof. And thereby he hath taught us, that this sublime Vertue is not
always found in elevated Fortunes, nor still lodged in Palaces: That
no body is received by her for his own Condition: That no body is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by reason of his Name or his Countenance: that she only consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the heart which hath its Sex apart, and Qualities differing from these
of the Body: And that Women, who are more then Women by their
Courage, can ascend as high, and approach as neer to Vertue as Men. This
Verity is important, and very useful; And the ensuing Question, which I
am going to defend, must needs Instruct, with Delectation and benefit, by
way of Divertisement.</p>

                  <p>THE Heroes, of whom there is so much mention made in History,
were not of the Gyants Race: And their strength reached not so
far as to root up Trees, and remove Mountains. Common people
nevertheless, who can comprehend no other greatness then that which tires
the sight; who know no other force then what begets noise and ruines,
frame <hi>Colosseses</hi> in their imaginations, when we speak to them of those
persons who are called Extraordinary: And because they hear that men
esteem their strength, and prize their valour, they believe in good earnest
that these persons had Arms of Steel, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>egs of Brass; and that with
their Fists they did beat down the Walls of such Towns as they had a
mind to take.</p>
                  <p>I think it necessary to reform this imagination of the Vulgar, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it to a more just proportion. It is not the heighth of Statute, nor the
strength of the Body which makes Heroes: It is the greatness and elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Soul: It is the Courage and Resolution of the minde: And
there may be very elevated Souls, and of the first Magnitude, in little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
a mind extreamly vigorous may be found in very infirm flesh. On
that side then there is nothing which can diminish the right of Women, or
hinder them from pretending to Heroick Vertue.</p>
                  <p>And finally, to render this right of Women more perspicuous, and to
support the pretensions of such as shall have the courage to raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to that Pitch; It is to be supposed that Heroick Vertue, to define it
rightly, is but an excellent Vertue, and elevated above common Vertues.
This excellency arises to her, first from the Dignity and Eminency of her
object, which <hi>is Good,</hi> considered in the highest elevation it may have. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it is derived to her, from the perfection of the Faculties by which
she acts: and these Faculties receive their perfection from a spiritual and
penetrating Fire, which inlightens and purifies the Intellectual part, which
warms and transports the Appetitive. Thirdly, it arrives to her from the
Nobleness of her principal functions, which are to act vigorously, and
with resolution, and to suffer couragiously, and with constancy. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Action, how vigorous and resolute soever it be, even the most coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and constant sufferance, cannot attain to this eminent and prime
<hi>Good,</hi> but by a certain transport of the Soul; which the Grecians call <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasme,</hi>
this Transport is the fourth Cause, which produceth the Excellency of
Heroick Vertue.</p>
                  <p>Let us say also, to leave nothing unsaid, that the most beautifull and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
form which Heroick Vertue gives to Love and Anger, is a fifth
Cause, which addes to her a fifth degree of Excellency. I speak here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the opinion of the Ancients, who believed that Love and Anger
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55122:150"/>
were the predominant Passions of Heroes: whether because they are of a
more subtile and combustible matter, and that there enters more interiour
fire into their temper, then into that of other men: Whether because these
two Imperious and Soveraign Passions cannot be well purified but by a
more Soveraign and Imperious Vertue then themselves, nor can receive
elsewhere, and by an ordinary effort their last perfection, and the fair forms
whereof they are capable. All these conditions contribute to the dignity
of Heroick Vertue, and raise it to a superiour Order, where common Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are not admitted.</p>
                  <p>This Order nevertheless is seated in a place to which one may approach
from all the conditions of life: All great Souls are equally summoned to
it: On what side soever one ascends, Women may ascend thither as well as
Men. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the most Eminent and Soveraign gallantry, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
object of Heroick Vertue, is not out of their sight, and cannot be above
their Pretensions Nature hath not assigned them an end beneath That:
There is no bound beyond which, they are exempted from cares, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
to their own sense. There is no space wherein <hi>Good</hi> may not be to
them more <hi>Good;</hi> wherein Duty cealeth to oblige them; wherein Vertue
looses the rights she hath over them. The Careir of Honour is to Them as
great as to Us: And in this Careir there is not one single place which is
not marked out, in which it may be permitted them to make a false step;
to suffer themselves to be overcome; to abandon Gallantry, to reject a
Crown. Moreover they are called to perfection as well as we: And the
Son of God, who proclaims to the Saints and Just, that they must not
grow weary in sanctifying themselves; and that they ought every day to
adde some new lustre to their Righteousness, hath not discharged Women
from this labour, nor marked them out bounds, beyond which they may
be unjust, and far from Saints. Not only then this Eminent and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Gallantry, at which Heroick Vertue aimeth, is not out of their reach,
but is within the limits of their right, and enters into their duties: And
there may be occasions found which will not leave them the freedome of
adhering to an inferiour <hi>Good.</hi> Such Encounters and Enemies may come in
the way, as will excite them even to the last degree of Vertue, or cause them
to fall into Vice.</p>
                  <p>As for what concerns the perfection of the Intellectual, and Appetitive
portion, which is as it were the head and heart of Heroick Vertue: It is
certain that these faculties are not different where there is diversity of Sex.
They have everywhere the same matter, and are capable of the same forms.
The lights which descend into mens minds, are not purer, or of a higher
Sphear then those that descend into the Souls of Women: And from
these equal lights, derived from the same spring, a like fire, and of the
same force, may be kindled in the heart of them both. There are some men
who have not so much as the first glimmerings of sound judgement. You
would swear that they had been made out of the Lees and Dregs of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
You would say that not one single spark of this Coelestiall Fire is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into their Constitution: And their souls are so burthened, the rinde
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55122:150"/>
which incompasseth them is so obscure and thick, as no light can penetrate
them with on single Ray of Truth, which can give them a beginning of
any vertuous heats. On the contrary, there are some Women who seem to
be onely made out of the pure Extraction of rectified matter. The superiour
portion of their souls is so pure, and so lively reflects all the luminous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
it receives, the Inferiour hath two so noble fires, and moves so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly,
and with so measured and just a swiftness, that it would not savor
of flattery to compare them to those fair Compounds, which are formed of
the Intelligences and Planets. It is not then the difference of Sex, which
makes any difference in the faculties of a soul: and since they have the
same perfection both in Man and Woman: since both may be imbued
with the same light, and penetrated by the same fire, let us descend freely
step by step to the consequence to which this discourse leads us; and let us
agree, that Women may be disposed by this light and fire, to the principal
Functions of Heroick vertue.</p>
                  <p>History is as knowing and perswasive in this point as Philosophy: and
the Examples she alledges are as just and formal demonstrations, as those
which are framed according to the Rules of Logick. If it be shewed by

                  <p>But without going so far from our Age, and Modern History; was there
not a Transport in that Maid of <hi>Agria,</hi> who preparing her self to fight upon

                  <p>Was there not an <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> in the action which a young Woman of
the same Town performed at the same Siege? She fought compleatly arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
between her husband and mother: and when her husband after a long
and obstinate fight was killed by her side, her mother advising her to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
and render him her last duties: <q>God defend me, replyed she,
from so unseasonable a piety. Now is the time to revenge his death, and
not to deplore it: his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uneral may be well performed afterwards, if we
live, and if it be ordained for me to dye upon his body, mine will be a
Tombe glorious enough for him; and my blood mixt with his, will
do him more honour then my tears.</q> These couragious words were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by a far more glorious action. She threw away her own sword,
and took up that of her husbands; whether she esteemed it better then
her own, and most accustomed to overcome: or whether she thought it
might have retained some remnant of his Valour and dexterity, which
would fight with her, and bring her good fortune: And fortified by this
imagination, she cast her self fiercely, and with order upon those enemies
that were the farthest advanced; She killed t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ree with her own hand;
made the rest give back; and that done, she retired with her husbands body,
and the satisfaction to have revenged his death, which was to her as just
and manly a satisfaction, as that which is sought in a spruce and
flaunting mourning in a sorrow as Ambitious and Vain as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</p>
                  <p>Besides this Transport, which is a visible and commendable excess of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and Constancy, there is another kinde of excess which Magnificence
seeks in its actions, &amp; which also appertain to Heroick vertue And we must
not forget to affirm by the way, that Women have gone as far, and raised
themselves as high as Men by this second kinde of Excess. One cannot
speak without vast terms of the Egyptian Pyramides: And the abrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
draughts which Antiquity hath left us of them, do even tire our sight.
Nevertheless, the highest and most stately of these Pyramides, were built
by the boldness and Magnificence of Women. The <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the skill of all Architects, and of all the Sculptors of Greece; and left nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Marble not precious stones in <hi>Asia</hi> and this Monument was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
and enterprize of a Woman.</p>
                  <p>The pendent Gardens of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and those Walls so famous for their
matter and structure, were the work of a Woman: And this self same
person who was filled with nothing but vast thoughts, and unlimited
designs, resolving to have her Statue erected in a place where she had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a battel, caused it to be made out of a whole Mountain cut out into a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Figure, and seated upon a Throne. And because it would not have
been decent to see a Queen alone, she commanded the Artist to dispose the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55122:151"/>
outward and superfluous pieces of the Mountain with so much Art, as
there might be wherewith to make out of them half a dozen of Guards.
Without dis-interring ruins, buried under so many Ages, there are in
<hi>France</hi> sumptuous proofs enough of the Heroick Magnificence of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
But being exposed as they are to publick view, it is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to exhibite them in this Place, my Designe not being to Write for Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
or blinde men.</p>
                  <p>As for what concerns these two Soveraign and predominant Passions,
which are the Noblest matter Heroick Vertue can employ, the Constancy
and Force of Conjugal Love, even the Transport and last Perfection
thereof, will never be brought in Dispute against Women by any man
that hath entertained himself but for one quarter of an hour in History.
They are not less capable of making good use of anger, of purifying its
fire by a more spiritual fire, of guiding it to the supream degree of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
by an Heroick transport. And to conclude this point by a single
Example, but a remarkable and crowned one; you will finde nothing
but Blood, Sallies, and a hasty and precipitate Impetuosity in all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
of those Heroesses whom we know, if compared to what <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis</hi>
did in this kinde.</p>
                  <p>A Province which she had newly conquered, having chased away her
Lieutenants, and shaken off its yoke by a publick Revolt; The news of
it being brought to her at the instant her head was dressing, She did not
presently Proclaim that Ropes and Gibbets should be prepared, as some
Princes have done in like occasions; But without the least raising of her
voice, or uttering one tart Word; without making shew of my alteration
or surprisal, she took an oath that they should never finish the dressing of
her head, till she had chastised these Rebels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Oath taken with a tone
of Rallery, and with a Majestical and graceful sternness, she commanded
her Women to lock up her perfumes and jewels; sent for her Arms, and
gave out Orders for the marching of her Troops; Took horse with her
hair half pin'd up, and half discheveld: And the not only began, but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the War in this posture. And if my memory fail me not, it was
after the end of the War, she caused that vast and stupendious Statue to
be erected, which I formerly mentioned. Let us acknowledge, that there
was much of Magnaminity and Gallantry in this Transport<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that this half dress'd head, was upheld by a great heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That there
was not a stronger nor a more capable One: And that a Crown could not
be found too great or too glorious for it.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have taken Heroick Vertue by lights purely humane, and
have scarce spoken of any other then That which hath been known to
Philosophers. But if the Question be concerning an Heroick Vertue
which is Christian, and sanctified by Grace; which hath been illuminated

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55122:152"/>
to it as well as we; and that their Pretentions are as Lawful, and

therein conjoyntly with her. Nothing but Great and Heroick, was
observed in all the parts of her life: All her days were days of labour, or
preparatives to it: And before she arrived to the Age of overcoming by
Action she learnt to overcome by Sufferance. Divine Providence having
made choice of Her to manifest to these last Ages, how far a great Vertue,
assisted by efficacious Grace, may Advance, deprived her early both of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother, and placed her single and without support in the way of
Vertue, as soon as she could support her self. It was no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and became the sooner Active thereby. She was Serious and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
Temperate and Severe, from the Age of Childish Toyes and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes:
And when other Maids play with Babbies, or are flattered by
their Nurses, Adversity made her Warlike, and taught her to vanquish
Fortune.</p>
                  <p>This Severe and Disciplined Childhood, was followed by a Youth full
of Storms and Troubles: And God, who would not suffer her to have
other then grave Satisfactions, and solid Contentments, permitted that
the first Roles of her Marriage should be overspred with Thorns. She

Eleventh: And this Choice, wherein Inclination was fortified by Interest,
had been generally approved by all the high Degrees of this Kingdom.
The King her Brother, who ought to be the first in purchasing Honours
to his Crown and House, singly opposed this general Approbation, and
blasted the publick joy by the sharpness of a private Grudge. He spred
snares of all sorts upon the ways of his Sisters Innocence: He used a
great deal of Art to dissolve the knot of her Marriage. He endeavoured
to break it by violence: But this Tye not being to be broken or loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ened;
and his snares being too visible, and too grosly laid to catch the prey
which he pursued; he turned his forces and anger upon the Places which
belonged to the Patrimony of <hi>Isabella:</hi> And if his malice had been
more prosperous and better conducted; if Defenders of the Right of
Innocence had not risen up, he would have turned her naked out of the
Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But God, who delights in defeating the Designs of Iniquity and tyes up at
his pleasure the hands of Usurpers, did not permit that Injustice, though
Powerfull, and assisted by Authority, should prevail against disarmed
Right, and forsaken Innocence. He was pleased to make use of <hi>Henry</hi>
to exercise <hi>Isabella,</hi> as Nature makes use of Wind to fasten young Palms:
as Artists imploy Fire and Iron to purifie Gold, and to give a kinde of
Soveraignty with the Image of the Prince. And after that the Vertue
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55122:153"/>
of <hi>Isabella</hi> made Warlike, and Fortified, Instructed and Beautified by this
exercise, had received the last form of Heroick Vertue; he sent death
which snatched the Crown from the spiteful and usurping Brother, and
placed it upon the head of the Sister, ordained to the glory of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to
the discovery of the new World.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be said with what Designs she ascended the Throne;
with what Dextenty and Force, with what Purity of Intention, and
Capacity of Minde she set her hand to the Helm. Policy was never
more able, nor more found, or better Designed; Reason of State was
never more extended, or powerful: the Graces were never more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
nor efficacious then in this Princess. She was the Domestick
Oracle of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the visible Intelligence of his Councel; The Wise
and Speculative of his Kingdom received from Her their purest Lights:
They deliberated of nothing but in her presence, and by the clarity of her
Minde. And ordinarily the uncertainty and doubts of Consultation were
not cleared but by her Councels, which dis-intangled confused opinions;
which Fortified the Timerous and Irresolute; which gave the being and
consistency to Affairs. She held likewise the Place of the first Cause and
principal Agent in the conduct of this great Engine: And the History of
<hi>Spain</hi> acknowledgeth that <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> I say, that able and wise <hi>Ferdinand,</hi>
did act nothing but by the direction, and as subaltern to <hi>Isabella.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Her first care was to rally the parts of the State, which the past troubles
had dis-joynted. Having rallyed them, she used much Art to link them
together. And her Art was so efficacious and successful, as she set them
all in their former places, and rendred to every one their first Settlement
and Natural Functions. Scarce had she restored Health and Repose to
this great Body, but she was necessitated to put her self in Arms to defend
it. <hi>Alphons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Not content to raign in a known World, and to overcome by the sun
of Europe, she desired to vanquish and raign in another World, and under
other Planets. For this end she contributed with her Courage and Treasure,
to the resolution and designs of <hi>Columba:</hi> She sent her Fortune with him in
quest of a concealed Heaven, and of an unknown Nature. And if Europe
at present be enriched with Gold, and precious Stones out of new Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
if the new found Lands be enlightened by the Faith and Religion
of Europe, both Europe and the new Discovered lands ought
to serve as an Ornament and Lustre to the Magnanimity of Couragious
<hi>Isabella.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Understanding and Magnanimity, were accompanied with an
exact and severe, an incorruptible and Disinterelled Justice. Whereupon
I call to minde that being sollicited to pardon a Criminal of quality, who
offered a very considerable summ for the maintainance of some Troops
which marched against the <hi>Moors;</hi> She made these Solliciters fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that she was not raised to the Throne to make Traffick of Favours
and Pardons, and to set Impunity and Crimes to sale And to the end there
might not seem to be any thing of Interest in her Integrity, or that she aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the Confiscation of the Criminals Estate, she gave it all entire to his
Children, and would not suffer their Succession to be in the least measure
diminished by it.</p>
                  <p>So far was she from grating upon Crimes and Penalties; so far was she
from laying up in her Coffers the price of blood, and the revenue of tears;
that this good Princess took no greater pleasure then in giving with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
hands; then in making men rich and happy. She measured the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of her Kingdome by the extent of her good deeds: She counted her
Revenues by the gratifications which issued forth of her Exchequer; and
her chief stock, her most dear and precious Treasure, consisted in the hearts
and affections of her people. Never were any liberalities more natural nor
less restraind, more obliging, or better disposed then hers. Never did Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
act more gallantly, nor after a more Heroick manner, then in her
hands: it was never more universal, nor extended to more uses, nor to a
larger compass.</p>
                  <p>Her Profusions did not slide away in unprofitable &amp; transitory Pomps:

                     <hi>Isabella</hi> was not onely Wise and Couragious, Magnanimous, Just, and
Magnificent: But her Publick and Active Vertues were accompanied
with other Domestick and Peaceable Ones, which were not the less vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
for making the less noise; and had not the less merit in being less
Regarded. I set down her Devotion in this Last, which had been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in a Religious Woman: her modestie and Civility, which savoured no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the height of her quality: her Patience, which might have made
a Heroess in a private Fortune.</p>
                  <p>Her Court was a School of Piety, Purity, and Modesty for the Maids

and in the eyes of men.</p>
                  <p>It was not one of those Mercenary and Interessed Vertues, which serve
not but upon good Terms, and for great Wages and Pawn: It was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>E not astonished to behold ruines flaming upon
the water: to behold a shipwrack suffered in
the very Haven, and without a Tempest. The
Accident is strange, and not to be paralleld;
and I know not whether the Sea, which is the
Theatre of great Adventures, which is the Element of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Prodigies, hath ever brought forth a greater
VVonder.</p>
               <p>This Coast is the Eastern part of the Isle of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> The
Turks, spectators of this devouring Fire, belong to the Army
which came newly from the Sacking of <hi>Nicosea:</hi> And
these flaming Gallies were appointed by <hi>Mustapha</hi> to bring
to <hi>Selim</hi> the news and testimony of his Victory. But For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
deriding his vanity, suppressed this News, and detained
his Deputies. A generous Captive, more worthy of a
Crown then a Chain, not being able to submit to the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
slavery which was prepared for her in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> fired
the Powder in one of the Gallies; and the fire dispersing it
self from this Gally to all the rest, set the Captive at liberty,
and revenged the injury done her Country, both pillaged
and made a slave to Infidels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:55122:157"/>
This Resolution required a most Heroick Soul, and of the
first Order: And there needed a daring and inventive Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
without Arms, and by one single Act to defeat a whole
triumphant Army: to take away the fruit and sense of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
even in the fruition of Conquerours, and not to leave
so much as a mark, or news of their triumph unconsumed. It
is wonderfull that so high a design, and which might have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
the Souls of four Conquerours, could enter into the
Heart of a Captive Maid. But the wonder is yet greater,
that from the Soul of this Captive there issued forth such a
flame, as made the Sea appear all on fire, which burned the
goods and inhabitants of a taken City, which consumed the
mourning of an absolute Conquered People, and the joy of
a whole Victorious Nation.</p>
               <p>If we had arrived but one moment sooner, we should have
beheld the first light of this flame. VVe should have seen it
sally forth all pure out of this great Soul, which could not be
taken with <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>cosia;</hi> which remained victorious even amidst
ruined Towers, and forced VValls; which hath preserved
liberty amongst so many Chains and Guards. But if this
flame appear no more, we see at least its effects; And Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
will see them also after us. VVe behold a City which
revengeth the violence of men by the violence of fire; which
is burnt upon the Sea after it had been pillaged on the Land.
We behold a vindicative and officious death, a death which
punisheth Pirates, and disinchaineth Captives.</p>
               <p>These flaming Chests were filled with the Treasures of
many Races. The Parsimony of covetous Men, and the
Excess of the Magnificent were laid up in these Packs of
Merchandise, which you see thus smoaking: And Captive
<hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Scli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> and the <hi>Sultanesses</hi> a precious Ensign of <hi>Mustapha's</hi>
Victory. But there is now nothing remaining, saving the
Ashes and Smoak of this sad countenance of Rapine: And
<hi>Mustopha</hi> looseth with it the marks of his Victory, and the
Ensigns of his Triumph. The Flame devours the Presents
which were designed for <hi>Sclim,</hi> and the waves swallow up
what was provided to adorn the <hi>Sultanesses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:55122:157"/>
You would say that these two Elements, otherwise so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible,
agree in the division of the prey which is fallen
to them. The Fire hath for its share all that is light, and
swims above water; and all that is heavy and slides to the
bottome, belongs to the waves. Many Loads of curious
and rich stuff equally perished there, and make a common
smoak. Those pieces of Purple, and Cloth of Gold, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as black as the Cordages and Sayles: And the Ashes
of those excellent pieces of Ebony and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vory, are coloured
like the consumed Masts, and the burnt Oars. But neither
the burnt Oars, nor the consumed Masts, nor the bulks of
five Gallies, all on fire, afford not so Tragick a spectacle as the
unhappy People, who suffer two deaths at once, and are
drowned at the very instant they are burnt.</p>
               <p>The Fortune of the Victorious is equall to the Fortune of
the Vanquished: And the self-same flame melted the
Chains of the Captives, and the Weapons of their Guards.
Some carryed up into the ayre by the first violence of the
Fire, had not a taste of their Liberty, nor so much as saw the
Death which freed them. Others less suddenly assaulted,
cast themselves into the Sea, and extinguished their life,
thinking to extinguish the Fire, which had as yet but seised
on their Garments. Those were not more happy who trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to severed Planks, and floating Oars. People are not thus
preserved from a shipwrack which the Winds and Rocks
have not caused. The devouring Fire followed them; and
what ought to have been a Plank of safety, proves to them a
floating Pile; and brings nothing to Land but their Ashes:
Certainly it is a lamentable spectacle to behold so strange and
new asport of Fortune; to behold burning Waves and
foaming Flames: To behold unhappy wretches who are
drowned in Fire, and burnt in Water, who approach to
Death through two contrary Elements, who fall at once into
two opposite extreams.</p>
               <p>I perceive that you are troubled about the Couragious
Captive, who saved her self by this Fire. You could wish
that it were in your power to finish her deliverance, and to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55122:158"/>
pluck her out of the hands of Death, as she forced her way
out of bondage and shame. In vain do your eyes seek her in
this confusion of variously shaped and coloured Deaths. The
fire begins its effects by her: and as if it had a mind to fire
her all entire, it left nothing but her Soul and Reputation,
which are no longer in a condition to be either inflamed, or
stained. So chaste and generous a Beauty ought not to be
disfigured, or to dye by parcels: and it was not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to preserve the Honour and Purity of her Body, but
even the Comeliness thereof: It was requisite to conserve
even the Grace and Dignity of her Countenance: and her
Death ought to be at least gracefull and glorious. Let us
speak more justly, she must not dye: she must only disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
like those Heroes who were carryed away all entire:
And nothing ought to remain of her but a name of good
odour, and a most Illustrious Memory.</p>
               <p>At present her Soul discharged of the burthen of Matter,
and freed from the Chains of Fortune, enjoys in repose the
fruit of the Tempest which she newly raised, and offers to
the God of the Christians a Sacrifice of four Turkish Gallies,
and of more then four hundred Innocent Souls which she
redeemed from Slavery, and saved from Apostacy. All
these beautifull Souls, glorious by their Liberty and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
ascend with the fire and smoak of this great <hi>Holocaust.</hi>
Doubt not but in ascending they applaud their Deliveress;
and look down with joy upon their broken Fetters, and the
pieces of their burnt Prisons which float upon the waves
with the bodies of their Guards.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile <hi>Mustapha</hi> overcome in his turn, beholds from
the shore the spoyl of his Victory and Gallies. He knew not
as yet upon whom to lay the blame: And before hand, out
of despite he bites his lips, &amp; blasphemes against the <hi>Alchoron,</hi>
and his false Prophet. The confusion appears barbarous,
and stained with blood in his eyes: And the disorder of his
mind augments the fierceness of his Action, and the cruelty
of his Looks. If he were not so far off, you might hear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
he vents forth against Heaven, for permitting the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55122:158"/>
fire to seize upon his Fortune; and suffering the Ensigns of
his Valour, and the subject of his Triumph to be burnt. The
Captains and Souldiers which accompany him, are in no less
disorder, nor less furious then himself: And their despair is
no less, to see the treasure of their Souls, and the recompence
of their blood and wounds thus perishing.</p>
               <p>The People of the neighbouring Towns, and the Parents
of the Captive VVomen ordained for the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>raglio,</hi> have ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
different resentments. The People assembled upon the
VVall, look with astonishment upon the Smoak of then
Spoyles, and the confusion of the Barbarians Avarice: and
they that clap their hands, seem willing to adde force to the
fire which is come to punish them. The surprised Fathers,
and astonished Mothers suffer on the shore all that their
Children endure in the fire, and upon the waves. Tears of
joy distill from their eyes for the deliverance of their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
Tears also of compassion and sorrow flow from them
for their loss: And the one mingled with the other, make
upon their Cheeks an expression answerable to their
Courage and Tenderness. These Tears nevertheless have
not extinguished the sense of Honour. Even the Mothers
render Thanks for the adventure which they deplore: And
you would say, that on the shore they expect to receive, with
the Ashes of their Daughters, their unstained Memory, and
their most pure and glorious Souls.</p>

Soldier entring into the Magazine of Powder, she went in readily after
him: and having found fire ready at hand, assisted by her good Angel
(as One may believe) and inspired by God, jealous of the honor of
Virgins, she took hold of this fire, and cast it into a barrel of Powder
which was ready to receive it. The Effect was sudden. At the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
the flame disperseth it self with an incredible noyse through the

                  <p>WHat I have said in Verse, is true; and I can say it also in Prose.
The strong Hebrew who threw down a Pallace, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
a whole multitude at his Death, did no more then this
Mayd. If she had not so much strength in her Armes, she had peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
more in her Heart and Mind. At least she overcame Love and Pleasure,
which vanquished <hi>Sampson.</hi> And the Captives death which was no less
then hers, a bloody Victory without Combat, hath manifested in these
latter Times, that Vertue becomes not decrepid with Years; that it
is now the very same it was in the Time of Heroes; and that the
alteration we observe therein, proceeds from its Subjects, and not from
its vigor and strength.</p>
                  <p>But this chaste and victorious Mayd speaks cheifly to those that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Chastity, and are jealous of the flower and glory of their Sex.
She teacheth them, that perfect Chastity hath her Enthusiasmes and
Raptures, that she cannot endure to be tyed, how rich soever her chains
may be: that Fortune hath no Mountains of Gold, nor Rivers of Silver
which she doth not pass over: that Ambition cannot build her so eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Pallace from which she doth not precipitate her self: that Excess
and Voluptuousness cannot tye her with so sweet chains which she doth
not break: that even Death it self cannot present to her, Obstacles which
she doth not overcome.</p>
                  <p>It would be a great Shame to a Woman who should profess Chastity,
to be fastned to a Trifle: if she could not break a silken thred: if she
dare not oppose her self to a few Thorns. And I know not how she would
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55122:160"/>
dispose of her Honor, if to conserve It, she were necessitated to set fire on her
house, to leap down into a Precipice, to expose her self to Swords &amp; Wheels.
Tender Women and such as Love their ease, will make answer to this,
that these Raptures belong not to the Vertue of their Sex; And that Chastity
is not reduced to so great necessity as Despair must defend it. The subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Question will shew what weight this Answer carries, and whether
Christian Philosophy be on her side.</p>

                  <p>THe Question doth suppose a Transport to be Essential to Heroick
Vertue: And that there is an <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> which forms Heroes as
well, as there is one which makes Poets: This Transport to define
it distinctly, and to give an Express, and pure Notion of it, is an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Effort by which the Soul is violently carryed to Objects, which
transcends the common reach of Men. And because our forces be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to those high Objects; and that the best disposed, and most
able amongst us, can hardly advance much further without being born
up; it hath been always believed, that there necessarily entred into these
extraordinary Efforts something, I know not what, Divine, which trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
Nature; and of this I know not what, whether it be a Spirit or
Divine Fire, the word <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> is composed, which the Grecians
have expresly formed for these Transports.</p>
                  <p>Here nevertheless we must call to minde that <hi>Enthusiasm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which they are Transported. If the Rapture comes only from the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual

                     </hi> is properly That which Ignorant and Prophane Men
stile the folly of Poets. But if the Rapture be from the whole Person;
if the Intellectual part carryes away the Appetitive, if the Soul Transports
the Body; and if by a joynt effort they all tend either to the Divine or
Soveraign Good, or to that eminent Honour which is in this life the last
point of consummated Vertue; this general Transport, being a Transport
of Action, is the same <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> which they attribute to Heroes, and
which Philosophers seek in Heroick Vertue.</p>

                  <p>Moreover all the Masters of Morality teach us, that Chastity ought
not to fight but in retiring: that she puts her self in danger when she
takes upon her to be Valiant, and shews her Face to her Enemies: that she
cannot attain to Victory but by a Retreat, even by Flight, and a very quick
and sudden Hight: All this agrees with the Spirit of Transport, which

                  <p>Thirdly, Chastity is not one of these Vertues which are born for Action
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

she hath the Innocence of Lambs, and the meekness of Turtles:
she hath a Temper contrary to Lions and Eagles. Of what use would
then this Spirit of Transport be to Sedentary Vertue? Of what use could
it be in time of Repose and Retirement? What would that Lamb do with
this Heart of a Lion? What would this Turtle do with the Violence of

                     </gap>:</p>
                  <p>All these Reasons are very good proofs, that Chastity is a Vertue of its
own Nature, Reserved, and a Friend to Repose: But they do not prove,
that she is never Armed with Boldness; that she never takes Courage;
that she is a ways concealed, and still possessed with Fear: There are some
Occasions wherein she must of necessity alter her Humour and Carriage;
wherein she must express Resolution and Courage; wherein she must Act,
even elevate her self, and elevate her self with a Transport. Doves which

                  <p>Let us say, that this Heroick Spirit of Rapture is not necessary to Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

her; if the Spirit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

her, to what place would not her Fears and Restraints hurry her? And
even in this, her Condition is likewise equal to that of true Valour, which
hath an other Countenance, and an other Heart upon a Breach then in a
Closet; which march<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>n with an other kinde of Action and Look to a
day of Assault, then to a day of Ceremony.</p>
                  <p>Let us only oppose hereunto, that the Comparison is not equal between
Chastity and Valour; between a Peaceful and Sedentary vertue, and one
that is Warlike and Tumultuary. Chastity hath her Wars and Combats:
And her Wars are more lasting and ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

and labonous then those of Valour. She hath likewise more need
of Courage and Resolution, as I have already shewn: And consequently
the Spirit of Transport which is the Spirit of Courage and Resolution, is
more necessary to her, then to this Vertue of Fire and Sword.</p>
                  <p>And here the Bravo's, and great Pretenders to Valour, must not flatter
themselves, not think to obtain it by the fierceness of their Looks, and the
greatness of Words. The honour of Chaste Women is not in a place of
easier Access, nor less Elevated then theirs. Nature cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

if we were only to defend our selves against Complacences and Caresses:
Yet there are sometimes Daggers hid under these Flowers; and these Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

Complacent and Courting. They change their Art and Posture according
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55122:162"/>
to the Resistance which is made to them. They imploy Iron, where Gold is
not powerful enough: and where Sweetness is weak, and Presents effect
nothing, they practise Cruelty: they display terror and punishments. I
mean that Chast Women have not only pleasing, but even terrifying and
bloody Temptations. They are not onely to defend themselves against Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

without moving or changing place, can overcome all these Enemies whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Complacent or Barbarous? That she is able to loosen her self from all
these eyes and snates, whether from those which allure, or those which
strangle? That she is able to master all these temptations whether sweet

so many Adversaries, and in so many Conflicts if she be not filled,

                     </gap>, and the Extasies of Heroick
Vertue.</p>
                  <p>Nature is strong and Attractive: Chastity must resist her Forces, and
loosen her self from her Allurements. The senses stick close to those Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
which are Commodious to them; and the Body hath a strange adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to pleasure, where flesh and blood bears a part. Chastity must either
sever the sences from these Interests, and must break all that fastens the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to these pleasures, or she must voluntarily separate her self from the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and break violently with the body. Death hath cruel and frightfull
Weapons: It is accompanied with terrible and furious Attendants. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
must be prepared to rush through all these Weapons: and to Essay the
Teeth and Nails of these Attendants, rather then suffer the least stain. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may be said, the Reputation of valour is not so precious, nor invironed
with so many Difficulties. Her Crowns, even those which are made by the
site of Canons and Granadoes, cost not so much: and Heroes are formed at
a less expence amidst Pikes and Breaches.</p>
                  <p>I forget not what hath been said of Modesty. She is the proper spirit
of Chastity: and they affirm that she is Timerous and Apprehensive: that
she hath Moderation and Reservedness. I confess that for the most part
she is not Precipitous: and that she is never Impudent. But she is not more
fearful then Fear it self: and Fear hath its sallies as well as Anger and
Boldness have theirs. Some couragiously endure Pain, for fear of another
Pain. Some cast themselves into the Sea, for fear of falling into it: And
to avoid one Death but apprehended, they precipitate themselves into
another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Let us remember that the Ermine, which is the Symbole of Modesty,
and the silent Mistress of the Chastity which Nature hath given to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Concerning which, to say thus much by the way, she hath Treated
them more Honourably then men, to whom she hath onely given an Ant
as the Emblem of Labour and Industry. The Ermine is extreamly fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and hath neither strength nor weapons: and yet this unarmed and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Creature had rather dye then be sullyed. And when she is pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
rather then to expose her whiteness to a stain, and save her self by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

her self into the nets of Hunters, and perishes with Courage. Behold a
Transport, and a Transport of Modesty; behold a Sally, and a Sally of
Purity in an Innocent and Fearfull Animal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And shall We deny the same
Transport and the like Raptures to chaste Women? Without doubt they
are capable thereof. An Heroick spirit and possessed with <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
it self sometimes with their Vertue, penetrates their hearts, and in
them inkindles a fire, breaks all the fetters of their souls, tears them
from their bodies, and carries them away with main force.</p>
                  <p>By this Spirit was that <hi>Pelagia</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> Transported, of whom S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
hath left us so fair a Picture. Perceiving her self besieged by Enemies
which attempted more upon her Chastity, then her Faith; she threw her
self down into a Precipice, with all the Ornaments and Jewels wherewith
she had Adorned her self, to render Honour to her Death, and add Grace to
her Courage. With the same Spirit her Mother and Sisters were possessed,
when pursued by the same Enemies, they cast themselves into a River, and
there quenched by Death the wicked Fires of their Lascivious Pursuers. A
Maid of <hi>Alexandria</hi> possessed with the same Spirit, having been informed
of the mischief which her Eyes, though otherwise reserved and modest,
had done to a young Man, she tore them out of her Head, and sent them to
the sick Person, to the end he might inflict such punishment on them, as he
should think good; or at least that he might heal with their blood, the
wound they had given him.</p>

                  <p>We ought to believe for the love of Vertue, and in Honour of these Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Heroesses, that there was some Spark of Divine fire in these bold At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps;
and that the Spirit which transported them, came from above, and
from a purer Spring then that which forms the Raptures which we may
follow, and the Examples which are lawful for us to imitate. Those are not
for every day; nor for the use of all sorts of Persons. Besides, God doth
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55122:163"/>
not send Angels to all sorts of Persons; nor every day creates new Stars:
And unless we have an Angel for guid, and a new Star to follow, it would
be a rash attempt to walk upon the Sea, and to chuse a Precipice for our
way. The ensuing Example is not of these Extraordinary Ones; yet is it
of the great and Heroick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if there be any thing of Transport, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from an even Spirit, and which is not raised but regularly, and by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual

there are Countries of War, and as it were Frontier Regions, where she is

she ought to be more Resolute and Warlike, then elsewhere: She

                  <p>They conducted her to a Pavilion, where all <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dia</hi> seemed to be with all
her Gold and Precious Stones: having about them so Magnificent proofs
of their Masters Power, they failed not to use far more Magnificent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerations;
and to add Immense and Unlimited Promises to so glorious
a Spectacle. They gave her in little, a Model of the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> but this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
in little, was greater then the real one: It was composed of sumptuous
Delusions, and glorious Dreams: and it cost them nothing to build it with
Carved Gold, and Fosset Diamonds. The most Magnificent Poesie could
not describe so much as these Vain people had set forth in Hyperboles and
Promises. And according to their words, if she would consent to the Will
of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> she should tread upon Scepters and Crowns; she should be
possessed with all the Goods of Fortune. But all these Painted and Boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Riches coming out of their mouths, were Dissipated by the Winde
which formed them, and reached not so far as the Ears of the <hi>Victorious
Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ve.</hi> Her minde was fixed on more Transcendent Promises, and more
Solide and durable Grandeurs: And Faith had so deeply imprinted in her
imagination the Wedding of the Lamb, the Crowns prepared for prudent
Virgines, and the Eternal Rejection of the Foolish, that she saw neither the
Pomps of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> which were shewn her, nor the Delights of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanesses</hi>
wherewith they endeavoured to Enamour her.</p>
                  <p>These troublesom people being retired to leave her a little Repose, it came
into her thoughts, that perchance the moment of Liberty was procured for
her by her Good Angel, to the end by an advanced and Couragious Death,
she might break her Chain: she might Triumph over <hi>Mahomet</hi> &amp; Fortune,
and rid her self in an instant of those Fears which possessed her, and of those
Vain Hopes which they laboured to infuse into her. The Occasion was fair,
and the Means Specious &amp; Magnificent. There was a Table in the Pavilion
Composed of Precious Stones, and certain great Vessels Enameled with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55122:165"/>
Gold: therewere about her Red some Silken strings which might serve for
this Execution, and offered her a Death as Compleat and Noble, as a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

                  <p>She useth up with this thought, and viewing those stately pieces of

to set her at liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and dost thou think thy self strong enough to overcome Death, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with all its Torments, and armed with all its Engines? But what
if the occasion of Martyrdom be taken from thee? What if thou hast no
Death to Contest with? What if the Tyrant doth only attempt upon
thy Honour? What if he attaqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

taking away thy life? O Captive and Inchaind Virginity! With what
Weapons wilt thou defend thy self against these Violences? Why wilt
thou remit thy Liberty to an uncertain Death, which perchance will not
arrive till thy Honour be lost, having so assured and ready, so Innocent
and pure a Means in thy power? This vain shew of Riches, is a Snare
laid for thee: go no farther to seek thy Freedom: it expects thee there.
Gold is as hard as Iron. A blow from these Vessels may as well break thy
Chain in pieces, as the stroke of a Sword: and if thou art well resolved
to dye, there are Rocks for thee; there is a Precipice at the corner of this
Table. God will pardon necessity; and excuse so just a Violence. He hath
heretofore Inspired &amp; Crowned the like. And the Church Honours those
Saints which drowned themselves to purchase Salvation, who have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
into Heaven by a Precipice. But what am I, that attribute In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations
to my self, and rank my self amongst the Saints? From whom
have I learned to discern Spirits a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d their Motions? Do I know of what
colour that Spirit is who sollicites me? And if he be a Spirit of Imposture
and indisguise; If what <hi>I</hi> take for Zeal, be Despair; Whither will this
Despair carry me, and under the Conduct of this Spirit of Imposture,
but to the Unhappy end of the Foolish Virgines? Let us leave Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
to the Providence of God: since he is a Jealous God, he will take
into his care the Honour of his Spouses. And if heretofore he deprived
Fire of Heat, and suspended the hunger of Lyons, well may he extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
if he please, the Ardour of the Tyrant, and suspend his Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Resolution was followed with a Prayer, which came more from
her heart then her lips, and into which there entred more Faith then Words.
However she was quickly interrupted by the Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>chs, who came to bring
her to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whose new Passion could allow him no Repose. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of his Captive had incensed him: it troubled him that amongst the
Ruins and Ashes of a Sack'd Town, any thing should be found more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful
then his Victory; greater and more sublime then his Fortune. And
he would not have it said, that a Maid, nay an Unarm'd and Inchained
Maid, had held out against him, after the taking of so many places, after
the Defeat of so many Fleets and Armies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:55122:166"/>
Nevertheless he tempered himself in her Presence, and renewed to her
the same Promises, augmented with boundless and unreserved Additions:
But this second Battery shook her as little as the former: and as the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
prepared himself to add Violence to his Promises, the Couragious Maid
put him back with a fierceness both in Countenance and Action, which
manifested that she was able to hold out against his Violence, as against his
Promises; and that he could neither gain her by Composition nor Force.
It is very true, that Love is Impatient and Stately upon Crowned Heads:
that it is soft, and easily wounded in hearts accustomed to Overcome. The
Heart of <hi>Mahomet</hi> being mortally wounded by this Action, gave way
to Anger, which is never more Furious or Terrible, then when it comes in
the Rear of a Potent Love And <hi>Mahomet</hi> Transported with this second Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
laid his hand upon his Cymeter, and with one blow Crowned the
Captive, broke her Chain, and struck off her Head.</p>
                  <p>This Victory was not in the time of the Primitive Church: yet it is no
less Illustrious then those of that Age. <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Conquerour was as
Redoutable as <hi>Nero</hi> the Esseminate: and his Tent was a Field of Battel no
less dangerous then an Amphitheater. Ladies ought to learn from hence,
that Heroick Chastity hath her <hi>Enthusiasms</hi> and <hi>Raptures:</hi> And these <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasms</hi>
and <hi>Raptures</hi> ought to master all Fears and Hopes: These Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ought to surmount all that is both Delightful and Terrifying: But
they ought never to Precipitate her, if the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> doth not transport
her, and if she be not excited by a Forreign Violence.</p>

Truly a holy Criminal, and an executed Queen, is a strange

old in Prison. Insolent and furious Heresie respects in this fair
Head, neither Regality, which is a kinde of visible and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
Divinity, nor Beauty, which is a Soveraignty by
naturall Rights, and a Domination without violence. And
what the most Barbarous Antiquity may not perchance
have ever seen; what the most credulous Posterity will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
never believe; all the Vertues and Graces are
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55122:168"/>
violated in her Person, and condemned to the same Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>She goes couragiously to it, and with a Countenance,
which bears still the mark of her Dignity, and the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of her Innocence. She preserved them both after the loss
of her Kingdom and Liberty; and Fortune, which deprived
her of her Subjects, and is going to deprive her of Life, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deprive her Heart of Soveraignty, nor her Looks of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
They are not fastned to Her, they are born with Her;
and create a Majesty independent on a Crown and Purple:
And thereby she will be no less a Queen upon a Scaffold,
then she hath been upon a Throne.</p>
               <p>You do not behold in her those fair Rayes of Beauty and
Youth, which were heretofore the splendor and spectacle of

                     </gap>vre,</hi> which were the joy and serenity of all <hi>France.</hi> But
at least you see her not dejected by her mishap, nor obscured
by her bad Fortune. Her greatness appears all entire, now
that the steps and footstool are taken from her: And if her
lights were then more pleasing and lively, those at present are
more vigorous, and less apt to be extinguished: Her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
have not only fortified, but rendred her far greater:
and the Admirers of her Beauty, who heretofore called her
the Sun of the North, and the Planet of the Sea, did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
that her Vertue would resemble the Sun and Planets,
which appear greater through a Mist, then in a most pure se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity,
and without a Cloud.</p>
               <p>Her white Haires which you see, are not occasioned by
Age, they proceed from Afflictions and Persecutions. They
are caused by unkind Kindred, and bad Subjects. They
come from <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Ministers: And if this be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unworthy, it is little less strange, that so beautifull a Head
should grow white before its time, under so many hands im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to darken it. But this whiteness is no dishonour to
her, nor lessens any thing of her Grace. Innocence and
VVisdom are of this colour: And even Majesty it self is
seen sometimes adorned thereby, and rendred more Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and August.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:55122:168"/>
Would you believe that those persons who brought her
to this violent Death by a precipitated old Age, do not he
bitter upon her heart, nor disturb the Calm of her mind? So
clean contrary, that she hath laid the very remembrance of
their Injuries at the foot of the Cross: She hath retired her
thoughts from all objects which might exasperate them: She
called them back from all places whence any succour or pitty
might arrive to her: and hath deposited them all with her
Heart and Faith, in the wounds of the Soveraign <hi>Patient,</hi>
who assisted her during her imprisonment, and at present
assists and fortifies her against Death, by the Image and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his Passion.</p>
               <p>He encourages her with the Voyce of his Blood, &amp; speaks
to her by as many Mouths as he hath wounds. He arms her
with his Thorns and Nails: He covers her with his Cross,
which is to her an invincible &amp; sacred Shield; a Shield which
could not be pierced by all the Darts of her bad Fortune; nor
shal it be by the Ax it self of the Executioner which will chop
off her Head. Vnder the protection of this Shield, and at the
sight of this Example, she marcheth couragiously to Death:
And though a Queen, and Innocent, it seems not harsh to her
to pass through the hands of an Executioner, having before
her eyes, a God executed, and Innocence Crucified.</p>
               <p>Can you confide so much in your eyes, as to expose them
to this lamentable spectacle? Mine, wounded before the
stroke, flie back, not to behold any more of it. Yet I must
enforce them to see All. The last Rayes of the setting Sun
are the fairest: And the last drops of blood great Souls
pour forth, are more sparkling then the rest; and have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
I know not what, of more Vigorous and Noble.
Surely this Action must needs be extreamly black, since en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
were used to hide it from the light. But the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurities
to which they exposed it, will not give it a better
gloss; and doubtless if they were capable of sense, they
would fear to be stained by it. You would say that these
Torches do not contribute thereto their light but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret:
You would say that in despite they produce nothing

And not so much as the fatal Scaffold, but is set forth w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the

The cruel Ministers of so cruel an Action, thought to
sweeten Injustice, &amp; civilize Cruelty; they thought to appease
violated Majesty; and to abuse the Patient by this vain and
sumptuous Hypocrisie. They ought to know, that Pomp and
Ostentation do not justifie Crimes; that artificial &amp; specious
Cruelty is no other Fury then naked &amp; unpolished Cruelty:
And that the voice of blood causeth it self to be no less heard
upon Velvet Carpets then upon the bare ground.</p>
               <p>I need not shew these cruel Ministers unto you. They
are discernable enough by the greediness of their eyes thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after blood, and by the impatience and fierceness of their
looks. To see the attention they afford this spectacle, you
would say that every one of them is the Executioner: That
every one is ready to give the blow with his eyes: and that
this blow was designed against the Head of the Catholique
Church, and not against the Queen of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the other Spectators, in whose hearts there remains
some tincture of Humanity, detest this cruel Example. And
as many Tears as they shed, are as many Voyces and Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
against those that both advised, and put it in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But the voice of just blood unjustly spilt, will shortly
make a greater noise. It will be heard by all People and Ages;
it will be the eternall malediction of that person who so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
violates Nature in a Kinswoman, Majesty in a
Queen, Hospitality towards a Refugiate, and Adversity it
self in an unfortunate Creature, consecrated by more then
twenty years of misery.</p>

as if her condemnation were theirs, and that they were to die
by her Death. The fatal Ax hath pierced their souls, and the

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55122:169"/>
It deprived them of motion and voice, even of the sense of
their Sighs and Tears: And in the condition they remain,
I see nothing which resembles them, but those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The noble and couragious Patient, with a serene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
beholds this sadness in her VVomen. Her Soul ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
above the inferiour portion, is no longer subject unto
its tempests and showers, to its sighs and tears. The Clouds
of Matter begin to clear up about her, and she already casts
forth certain Rayes of advanced glory, which mingle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with those Angels who are come both to guide her,
and give a beginning to her Triumph.</p>
               <p>The Crown which they brought her, is not of the same
matter as the other two which are taken from her: No
Thorns or Reeds enter there: There is nothing sharp or
brittle; nothing which offends or burthens: And it is not
an Ornament of the same stuff and weaving like our Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dems,
which serve only to make Slaves glorious, and proud
Mortals miserable. It is a Crown of solid and pure Glory:
It is independent of Fortune, and stronger then Time: And
the wise Queen, who understood the value of it, would have
given all earthly Crowns to possess but one flower of it.</p>
               <p>Behold with what stedfastness of mind she presents her
Head to the Executioner, to receive from his hand this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Crown. But stay, do not stain your eyes with the
murther of the Innocent. God will have an account of the
least drops of her blood: And wo to the Hands and Hearts;
wo to the Mouths and Ears; wo even to the Eyes, in which
any stain of it shall be found.</p>

drawn after another manner then that of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> Other
Incense must be burnt, and other Crowns placed before a Martyr, then
upon the Altar of an Idol. Besides, all these Titles are equivocal Terms;
and properly signifie neither Vertue nor Vice. Magnanimous Persons are
not always Nobly born: And a great Courage is not ever of a great
House. Cedars and Palms grow in Vallies: Broom and Fern-Brakes are
found upon Mountains. Beauty is rarely Innocent: And Graces are
Flowers which may have an ill odour and grow in a bad Soyl. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Elevation and Lights of the Minde, they are common both
to Vertuous and Wicked Persons: And oftentimes we see Comets which
have more Fire, and are more elevated then great Planets. In like manner
Magnificence is a Vertue which may prove unfaithful and Heretical
which may be Imprudent, and condemned with the Foolish Virgins: And
we know that the Piramides of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and other like Wonders have been
erected by debauch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Let us then lay aside equivocal Titles and ambiguous Elogies: We
have Proper and Formal ones. Let us not say that <hi>Mary Stewart</hi> was
descended from a continued Line of Kings. But let us say that she had a
more generous Heart, a more Royal Soul, and Soveraign Reason, then all
the Crowned Kings from whom she derives her Extraction. Let us not
esteem her for Beauty, which is common to the Rose and the Poppy;
to Chaste, and Lascivious Women; but for a Vertuous and Disciplined
Beauty of good Odour and Example. Let us neither praise her Graces
nor her W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t: but let us commend the Reservedness and Modesty of her
Graces: Let us praise the Discretion, Sweetness, and Moderation of her
Minde: And let us not speak of her Liberalities, or say that they were
judicious and well Ordered: that they were choice, and disposed with
Method. Let us say, that she understood the Art and Secret of a Benefit;
that she knew how to give with Heart and Spirit, with her Countenance
and Looks. And that after Fortune had taken all from her, she continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be magnificent in Desire and Affection; and to make great Presents
with slight things.</p>
                  <p>The French <hi>Muses,</hi> who lived in her time, failed not to praise this part of
her Vertues, which had been beneficial to them, and done honour to
Learning. And truly they would have shewed themselves very ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
if they had not praised Her. It was no fault of this good Princess, that
they were not all Rich, and at their Ease, that they were not all Apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Cloth of Gold, and lodged in the <hi>Lourre.</hi> She Treated them fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55122:171"/>
and as her Companions: she recreated her self with them in Prose
and Verse; and the Sport never ended without some Present which clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

                     </gap>a's harmonious.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Courage which was her Predominant Vertue, and gave her
a place in this Gallery, it appeared in <hi>France, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> In <hi>France</hi>
she resisted Prosperity, and vanquished Excess and Pleasures, which some
have conceived much harder to overcome then Grief and Afflictions. She
preserved her self from the Corruptions of the Court, and from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsom
blasts which are ingendred by ease, and which attend a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

little less then new Created Planets, she shewed much Modesty under a
great Crown, and upon the highest Throne of the World a most eminent
Devotion and a Consummated Piety.</p>
                  <p>But because Vertue happy and at ease, is in a continual Violence; and
that violent things cannot last but by Miracle: God who made choice of

                  <p>Being returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Widow to <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, and to his
Fortune; And her Youth, joyned with the Supplications of her People,
and Reason of State, having obliged her once more to Marry; that which
ought to have been her Support, proved the cause of her Ruine. Heresie
imaged at the Zeal she bore to the Conservation of the Catholique Faith,
cast Fire into the Royal House to make it pass more easily from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church. Calumny, Ambition, and Jealousie, prepared the Fuel
for this Fire, and inkindled the Matter. But the good Queen having
quenched it by her Prudence and Address; Heresie which sought to Reign
by some one of its Faction, blew up the King her Husband by a Mine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
some endeavoured to blemish her with being the Contriver of this
Fire and Mine: And they slandered her very Mourning; and made her
guilty of her second Widowhood.</p>
                  <p>This Calumny proved a harsh Tryal to her: Yet it was but an Essay,
and as it were an Advance of the Disorders and Mischiefs which ensued:
And no Tragedy appears so Confused, as the life of this good Princess. All
her days were marked with some Revolt and Conspiracy. They were
Celeb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

her but a Crown of Martyrdom, and God gave it her in <hi>England,</hi> after a
Conflict of nineteen years, rendred in several Prisons, and determined at
last upon a Sca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <head>MORAL REFLECTION.</head>
                  <p>THis Picture moves Compassion, and is of great Example: There is
much to Deplore, yet more to Imitate: And for the Instruction of
eminent Fortunes, and the Consolation of mean Ones, Greatness is
there Innocent and Unhappy. <hi>Mary Stewart</hi> conserved her Innocence under
two Crowns: And in the Vastness of two Kingdoms, which she lost one
after the other, she was much longer a Christian, and with more Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
then a Queen.</p>
                  <p>On the one side this teacheth elevated Persons, that there is no Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
estranged from God, nor any Fortune rejected by him, provided it be
just. That the Unction which makes Kings and Queens, doth not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
that which Forms Saints and Holy Women: That Palaces and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mansions are not out of the Road of Heaven. That though Piety,
Modesty and Patience reside not usually at Court, yet they are no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
there: And that Vertue is more Perswasive and Exemplar upon a
Throne, then in the Tub of the Cynick.</p>
                  <p>Likewise on the other side they should learn, from the Afflictions of
this great Queen, to make less Account of Diadems which are torn in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
of Scepters which are broken, and of Thrones which tumble down,
if never so little touch'd by Fortune, then of the Grace of God, which was
a Purple Robe that remained to this devested Queen, an Unction which
is not obscured in her Prison, nor effaced with her Blood: A Crown
which cannot be taken off with the Head.</p>
                  <p>She was not only an Innocent and Vertuous, but an Unhappy and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
Queen: And thereby she teacheth both Great &amp; Rich Ladies, that there
is no Quality Priviledged in this Life. The Purple of Soveraigns hath its
Thornes, as well as that of Roses: Great Fortunes and great Structures
have their Storms: Elevated Heads have their Tears, as Mountains have
their Waters: And whatever Ambition makes us believe, the greatest Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
are not upon Wheels: They sit upon Thrones invironed with
Ballisters.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the ill Rumors which have been spred of <hi>Mary Stewart,</hi> and the
Insolence of Calumny, which hath disfigured her, teach those of her Sex
and Condition, that no Vertue nor Crown is free from detraction. Dogs
indeed bark against the Moon which is so pure: Frogs croak against the
Sun which is so beneficial and resplendent. Monstrous Figures, and the
names of Beasts have been imposed on the Vertues of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eaven: And there
is no Illustrious Plane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, which hath not been accused of some Crime.
However they take no Revenge: And what stains soever are laid upon
them: What Vapours soever arise to them from the Earth, they cease not
to do good to the Impostors which dishonour them: they forbear not to
inlighten the Earth which obscures them.</p>
                  <p>There are other Considerations to be made here upon the Providences
of God; upon the Adversities of suffering Vertues and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

upon the Blessings and Advantages of these Adversities. But these Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
are too Important, and too useful to be shut up in so narrow a
compass. They require more Leisure and Extent: And if whole Volumes
should be imployed therein, I need not fear that the subsequent Question
would be cast away.</p>

                        </gap>s.</hi> Now Adversity is the proper state of Vertue, and Vertuous
persons: It is the most commodious and favourable Treatment which
God can use towards those precious Souls which he cherishes with Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Love, and which he hath withdrawn out of the Crowd. It is the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Ornament and preparation of that Righteousness which he requires in
his Spouses. And these their Advantages of Adversity deserve at least that
we should not cast an ill look upon it, if we have not a mind to cherish it:
They will deserve that we should receive it with patience, if we have not
the Courage to meet it, and rejoyce at its arrival.</p>
                  <p>First, it is certain that bad times are the most proper for Vertue: Her
good seasons are produced by Hayl-storms and Wind, by War and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests:
And if Adversity be not her Mother, she is at least her Nurse and
Governess. You may see some smooth-faced, adjusted, and simpering
Dame set out with holyed Grains and Chaplets; disguised with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
Modesty, and with Tears squeezed out by force: And this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
Creature would have her self taken for Vertue. But you must
not be mistaken in her, she is not Vertue: She is a counterfeit which
would fain imitate her, but doth it unhandsomly; which Apes her, yet
hath not one hair of her Head by which to resemble her. Vertue, as some
imagine, is not an idle quality, and addicted to case: A habit made for
shew, composed of Countenances. It is a laborious and active quality:
It is a Warlike and Victorious habit: And wise men, to whom heretofore
she appeared, never saw her unarmed; they never saw her but amidst
Thorns, and upon Mountains: They conceived that her Pallace was built
with shipwrackt pieces, with the remnants of burnt house, with great Oaks
blacked and beaten down by storms of Thunder. She must be furnished
then with Contrarieties, that she may labour; She must find resistance
which may exercise her, and give force to the vigour of her action: And
if she had no Adversity nor Adversaries; if all her hours were serene, and all
her dayes, dayes of Peace, against whom would she offer Combat? In what
season would she gain Victories? Upon what Title would she demand
Crowns?</p>
                  <p>This concerns the generall duty of all sorts of Vertues; I say even of
those which are only industrious; which only labour exteriourly, and in
a Mechanick way; which are limited by Time and Matter. The Vertue of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55122:173"/>
a Pilot hath its chief action amidst the tumult of turbulent Waves, and
boysterous Winds; amidst the confusion of the melting Heavens, and the
townng Seas. The Vertue of a Physitian, and of Drugs, express their force
upon mutulated members, and wounds, through which the blood slides
away with life. By the same reason a Wrastler is as no Wrastler at a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
and a Souldier is as no Souldier at a Ball. The Vertue of them both
must be assaulted. It requires Resistance and Adversaries: it is atchieved by
Sweat and Dust, with Blood and Wounds.</p>
                  <p>It is the same with Moral Vertue, nay with Christian Vertue, which is
of an Order transcending all the rest. Her condition is to labour and
fight, to part with her blood, and to receive wounds. And if this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
seem troublesome to her, she must remember, that in the list of this
life the Prize and Acclamations of the Combat are not reserved for Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators;
for those lazie persons Crowned with Flowers and Perfumes,
who are content to look on quietly and at their ease. They are for those
that fight Couragiously, who mingle their blood and sweat with the dust
of the lists, who shew great Hearts and great Souls by great Wounds.</p>
                  <p>But Vertue is Innocent: And the wounds of the Innocent are more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
then those of the Culpable. Such persons as are wounded and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
in the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sts, such as endure Rain and Wind in the Trenches, such as
leave their Arms and Legs upon a Breach, or in a pitcht Battle, are not
Criminals drawn out of a Dungeon or a Gally. And after all, if Wounds
do so much torment this innocent Vertue, she may lay down her Arms,
and depart out of the Lists: She may also settle her self if she thinks good
near to Voluptuousness; paint and adorn her self like her, take half of her
Nosegayes and Perfumes; borrow her Looking glass and Fan. But this
once done, she must no longer call her self Vertue, nor pretend to Glory,
and her Crowns. Besides, Vertue never yet appeared effeminate, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous,
nor painted or perfumed: And no person was ever seen to
pretend to Glory, and run after her Crowns with a head covered over
with painting, and loaden with Flowers, with a Fan in her hand, and a
Looking glass at her Girdle.</p>
                  <p>Afflictions and Adversities are then the proper state of Vertue: as War
is the proper season of a Souldier; as the Lists is the proper place for him
who pretends to the Prize. And therefore let us no longer say that Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and Vertuous Women are unjustly afflicted: Let us no longer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to hazzard and tumult, what is according to natural order, and placed
in a just proportion. And let us learn once for all, that if Vertue be in her
right place, when she is in Adversity: if she doth her duty when she suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers;
Ladies who follow her freely, and in good earnest, cannot complain
of their ill Treatment, when God obligeth them to the same duty, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains
them to remain in the same state.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, he cannot afford them a more important tryall of his
Love, not more efficaciously testifie that he hath the thoughts of Salvation,
and the heart of a Father for them. Thereby he purifies and frees them
from vitious superfluities: He deprives them of what adulterates and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55122:173"/>
He prepares them for Crowns, and the Inheritance of a Future
Life. It is certain that there is no Vertue so pure, which hath not some
stain: There is not any so sound, which hath not some part either infected
or indisposed: And if this be true of Vertue, which saved her self in the
Desert; which put off her shooes, and forsook with them the dirt and
High ways at the foot of the Mountain: What will become of that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
which resides at Court and amongst the great Ones; which hath been
nourished with a dangerous and corrupted Fortune; which hath Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiques
as much cryed down as Riches, as Scandalous and Debauch'd as
Pleasures? Is it possible that she should be so sound, and have so good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatives
as the Ayr of the Court cannot corrupt her? that she should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
nothing from the Opinions and Customs of Men? that she should not
be infected by the Contagion of Fortune? that Riches should not puff up
her Heart and Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Pleasures should not beget in her Infirmity or
Corruption? And if there be no Vertue so Vigorous, not Reason so well
Fortified, which is able to resist so many things which spoil and corrupt;
I ask of a Lady, what usage might be best for her in that state, and what
choice she would make, if God had left it to her self? I hardly believe that
she would choose to be given over by the Physitian. The Election would
not be much better, then if she should make choice of a Precipice: the
Dispute would not be about the End, but the way to it: And if she had
rather perish by a Precipice, she cannot do it more certainly then by sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
It remains then, that she put her self into the hands of the Physitian,
and relye on him for the ordering of her Maladies and Wounds.</p>
                  <p>But she should be very ignorant, if she expected to be cured by him
with divertisements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with leaving her to her ease, with making her laugh.
Do the Maladies of the Body become obedient to such Remedies? Do
they heal her wounds with Leaves of Roses, and the Oyl of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>? Do
they not proceed against them with Bitterness and Pain, with Irons and
Fire? Nevertheless these Wounds remain only in the Superficies; and these
Maladies are often caused by a grain of Sand which pains them, or by a
drop of Humour slipt out of its place. And shall we likewise believe that
Interiour and Spiritual Maladies; that voluntary and inveterate Wounds
will be cured with Ragouts and Perfumes, that they will pass away at
Play or at Table? Shall we believe that the Friendly and Domestick Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Soul, that Vices avowed by the Will, and habituated in the
Heart will flie at the sound of Musick; will be chased away by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of a Persuming Pan? They will need bitter Potions and painful Incisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
They will require Remedies of Iron and Fire: And these Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Iron and Fire are the Adversities which God Ordains them; and
which are profitably and successfully applyed to them by Patience. It is
much better then, for Ladies to be Purged and Cured by Adversity, how
distastful soever her Medicines may be, then if by an unfortunate Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
they were abandoned to Contagious Prosperity, which would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
their Corruption.</p>
                  <p>This so harsh Treatment, and painful in appearance, will be yet found
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55122:174"/>
more wholsom and beneficial; if we adde, that thereby they are prepared
for the Wedding of the Lamb, and for the Crowns of the other Life. We
are not received at this Feast with soul Garments, and hands fullied with
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the fauest Head of the World which should have but one stain
will never be Crownd there. It is necessary then for us to be purified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we present our selves to this Feast: And those Souls doubtless are the
most happy which arrive there perfectly cleansed. Besides that, they are
not made to wait at the Gate, they have Purity here at a cheaper rate then
in that Country. The fire of Adversity, what hand soever inkindles it,
what winde soever blows it, is not by much so ardent as the Fire of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory:
And we are better Treated by Tribulation, nay by the most severe
and harsh can be imagined, then by these purifying Devils, which, as a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father saith, Act the same thing upon Souls, as Fullers do upon Stuffs
which are put out to be Dyed.</p>
                  <p>This so entire and perfect Purity ought to be accompanied with all the
Features of an exact and compleat Beauty: And this Beauty also ought to
be Royallie endowed, and to have a large stock of Riches. Now the
Beauty of a Soul, which is beloved of God, and his Holy Angels, is not
formed with Paint and Plaister, with Silk and Flowers: She is framed by
Maladies and Wounds: and her most delicate Painting ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
both of Blood, Tears, and Ashes. The Beauty of St. <hi>Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there is no Beauty in Heaven, which Adversity hath not made, and
Patience adorned.</p>
                  <p>As for those Riches which should make up the Dowry of this Beauty;
they are not the Fruit of a sweet Life, nor the Revenue of Pleasure and
Pastime. The very Riches of the Earth; even those gross and Material
Riches which belong to the lowest Story of the World, are Fruits of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
and arrive to us from the Tribulations and Afflictions of Nature.
Pearls and Coral are found in the Element of Tempests and Bitterness:
Precious Stones are taken out of Precipices and Rocks: Gold and Silver
are born Prisoners and in Dungeons: And if they be drawn out of their
dark holes, it is to make them pass through Iron and Fire: it is to make
them suffer all the Punishments of Criminals. Certainly, if Terrestrial
and meer Imaginary Riches are the Fruits of Labour, and the Daughters
of Adversity, it would not be Just, that the Riches of the Minde, which
form the Great Saints of the Kingdom of God, and the quiet Possessors
of Eternity should be the reward of Idleness, and the Heritage of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.
These Spiritual Riches then are the Inheritance and Revenue of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity:
And consequently this harsh and Laborious Adversity is more Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to great Ladies then Prosperity, which stain's and infect's them;
which sometimes even impoyson's, and strangles them.</p>
                  <p>Surely they would be very nice, if they did bear their good Fortune
impatiently and with complaints: if they were wounded by their Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55122:174"/>
if they groaned under the Matter of their Crowns. Since Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
is sent them by the Bridegroom to prepare them for his Wedding; It
is very just that at least so good an Office should make them rellish the
rudeness of its Hands, and the severity of its Countenance. Surely they
would weep with a very ill Grace, if they lamented that pressure which
adornes them; Because it loads them with Gold and Jewels: because it
pricks them by fastening on them Garlands and Crowns. They suffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Fortune on their Heads, and the Rack on their Bodies; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
themselves to Iron and Fire to appear Beautiful in the eyes of men:
And it would be truly a great shame that they should please God with less
Trouble, and more at their Ease. But here is enough to justifie the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God; and to shew to Vertuous and Afflicted Ladies how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they ought to esteem the Grace and Riches of Tribulation. It remains
to confirm them by a second Example, which hath the same Features, and
almost the same Colours as the first; and I hope it will have no less Force,
nor prove less perswasive, though it be less fresh, and more remote from
our sight.</p>

                  <p>IT is true, that Crowns are great Ornaments to Beautiful Heads. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
they are Ornaments which Pain more then they Adorn. And I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much doubt that no Person would burthen himself with them, if their
Thorns were visible. However their Thorns are not so well hid, but
that some of their Points still appear: And besides the secret Rack, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
Crosses which great Fortunes endure; there are likewise Exteriour

they are Tormented in the sight of the World for the Instruction of

who like Great Planets have much Light, and very few Blemishes. And
yet very often the Crosses of these Grandees are more harsh and heavy
then those of Violent and Impious Rich Men; then those of Bloody and
Tyrannical Great Ones. God Ordains it in this manner, as I said before,
to prepare them for Crowns by Patience, and to leave unto Great Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

therein, and to have her share of the Poison and bad Fortune. She pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
received all that fell upon her. Besides, she joyned Grace with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:
And being indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d with a pleasing Humour and a Gallant Spirit,
she made Answer to such as lamented her Condition, That having taken
upon her Marriage Day the Rose of <hi>England,</hi> she ought to bear it intire, and
with all its I horns.</p>
                  <p>Moreover King <hi>Henry</hi> had a great inclination to Repose, and no Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to Pleasure. The Mildness and Indifferency of his Spirit did not
Correspond with the Functions of Regality, which required Courage
and Resolution Noise and Stirs made him w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were in his own choice, he contented himself to have Ease and Repose for
his part, and left to his Favourites and Ministers of State, the Authority
with the Trouble, and Affairs with the Tumult.</p>
                  <p>This Soft and Slothful Life afflicted the Queen, who had a High and
Active Spirit, Noble and Manly Thoughts; and a Head as Capable to
fill a Crown as any Prince of Her Time. Not that she did not affect the
Repose of her Husband, and wished him his Hearts Content. But her
Love being Magnanimous, and of the Complection of her Heart, she
would have rather liked in him a Glorious Activeness, and accompanied
with Dignity, then this stupid Repose, and these mis-becoming Eases,
which Dishonoured him. Truly this Prince, though otherwise good, was
not beloved by his Subjects: And his Reputation bore the brunt of all
the Faults of his Favourites and Ministers of State. The Revolt of the
Grandees, the Seditions of the People, the Mutin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>London</hi> (who was then a Popular Soveraign, and a King of the third E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state)
and generally all the Disorders of his Kingdom were cloaked with
this Pretence.</p>
                  <p>All these Commotions grieved the Queen: But they did not affright
her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She hastned still with the first to the most wavering Places: and where
Power and Authority might stop any Disorder. Her principal Effort was
upon the Kings Spirit: <q>She continually represented to him, and with
Pressing and Efficacious Terms, that the Repose of Kings consisted not
in the softness of their Bed, but in the stability of their Thrones. That
the Throne could not be secure, if Esteem and Authority do not Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it: And that Esteem which ariseth from Action and Authority,
which grows from Courage, are lost by Sloth and Softness: that Affairs
are truly very ponderous; but that this Weight procures the Stability of
Affairs: And that there could be nothing more Fickle and Tottering
then a King, who discharges himself of all that lies heavy upon him.
That it were to Act a very bad part, to play the Titul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r King; and to
Reign by Agents and Deputies: That Authority Substituted, and out
of its Place, is weak, and without vigour: And the Scepter which
hath Force, and begets respect in the Hand of a Prince, is easily broken in
the hands of a Subject, and Resembles a Scepter in a Play.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These and other like Remonstrances, accompanied with the Eloquence
of Beauty, and the Perswasion of Love, Fortified the Kings Spirit, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55122:177"/>
made him take a firm Resolution to Reign for the Future without a Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and to Act of himself. He Resumed that Authority, which he had

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>France.</hi>
                     </q> That she began not her Work amiss. And that if the end of

Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> had done, in a short time not one drop of good Blood,
not one single Noble part would be left in the Body of the State.</p>
                  <p>The good Queen was very far from entring into these Tragical Thoughts:
And though she truly wished Authority and Power to the King her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
yet she did not wish him such an Authority, as might be hated and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
not s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch a Power as might cause Desolation and Ruines. Besides,
less was it in her Thoughts to procure the Destruction of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ree upon
which she her self was Grafted. And if she bore much Affection to the Stem
of her Race which was in <hi>France,</hi> she had much more for its Flower and
Fruit which were in <hi>England.</hi> She opposed nothing to these Rumors, but
the voice of her own Conscience, which spake lowder then Calumny, and
justified her before God, against the Impostures of Men.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless Calumny found so much Matter prepared to take Fire;
and blew so hotly, and effectually upon this Matter, as it grew into a great
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lame, which was like to burn all <hi>England,</hi> if <hi>France</hi> had known how to
entertain it, and make Advantage of this Occasion and Disorder. The
Accident befallen the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and the new Authority of the
Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> served for a Pretence to Ambition; and were the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and Superficial Causes of the War. The Duke of <hi>York,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and followed by all the Faction of the White
Rose, raised a powerful Army; and ordered it to march directly to <hi>London.</hi>
The King took the Field on his part, with the Party of the Red Rose, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55122:177"/>
with all the Forces he could draw together. The Battel was Fought at
<hi>Northampton:</hi> And God who is not pleased that just Right should always
prevail; and that Fortune should follow Vertue every where, permitted
the Royal Army to be Defeated, and the King himself to be taken Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by the Rebels.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> grown insolent by his Victory, brought him in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
to <hi>London,</hi> and caused him to be shut up in the Tower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
secured on that side, he put off his Mask of colourable Pretences,
wherewith he began the War: And Represented to the Parliament the
double Right his House and Fortune gave him to the Crown. Force in
like Occasions is a powerful Piece, and Victory an Eloquent Advocate.
However the Parliament yielded not wholly to Force and Victory: It
respected the Vanquished Right; and durst not Degrade Majesty, though
devested, and loaden with Chains. The Resolution of the Parliament
was, that during the Life of <hi>Henry,</hi> the Duke should rest satisfied with
the Title and Functions of Lieutenant General of the Kingdom; and that
the Crown should pass by Succession to his Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

the Exclusion of the House of <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A greater Affliction could not befall the Queen; she saw her Enemies
upon the Throne, the King her Husband in Prison, and under the hands of
an Executioner; the Prince her Son publikely Degraded, and Excluded
from the Crown by a Solemn Decree. All that could have Supported her
in this Revolution, was either fallen or tottering: And except her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Hopes, which Fortune was not able to cast down, there was
nothing about her but Shipwrack'd pieces of a ruined Greatness. But afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Vertue doth not waste her self in outcryes and tearing her hair: She
knows how to Discipline Affliction, and animate Grief: she knows how
to set together broken pieces, and contest with Ruins.</p>
                  <p>The Couragious Queen made this use of it: And instead of exhausting
her self by vain Complaints, and Superfluous Tears: Instead of Imputing
her Mishap to the Planets, or accusing Fortune, she thought to overcome
in Despite of the Planets and Fortune; and began to Levy new Troops.
To supply the Defect of Money which she wanted, the grace of her
Speech and Countenance served in lieu of Pay to the Souldiers: And this
Honourable Payment left a sting in the most benummed Souls, and infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Boldness into the most Fearful. Not believing that she might hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly
commit to Lieutenants an Affair which concerned the Freedom of
the King her Husband, and the Destiny of her House; she resolved to
take part in the Danger, and attempt in Person against Fortune. She put
her self then in the Head of her Army, and marched directly to <hi>York,</hi> where
the Forces of the Enemy were Encamped.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>England</hi> never saw an Army which had a more Beautiful Leader: No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
did it ever see any one Fight with more Courage. The Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who
Mustered above Ten thousand Men, perswading himself that he might
purchase a young Queen at a cheap Rate, went to meet her against the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of his Commanders, and presently exposed the Business to a general
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55122:178"/>
Battel. It cannot be express'd what the Queen effected by the Greatness
and Courage of her Words; by the fire of her Eyes, by the boldness of
her Looks, and of her whole Person. She infused Courage, Ardour, and
Impetuosity into her People: She seemed to give even Sense, Activity and
Address to their Weapons. If <hi>Victory</hi> her self had Marched before them, in
the Equipage and Lightnings which our Imagination ascribe to her, she
could not have done more. The Rebels received a total Overthrow: The
Duke of <hi>York</hi> taken with his Son, the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> and the Earl of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
passed through the hands of the Executioner. Their Heads were
exposed upon the Walls of <hi>York</hi> on the point of three Spears; To the end
the Example might make a greater shew, and be the more Famous; and
that Rebellion might be instructed afar off, and with the more Terrour. A
Crown of Paper begitting the Dukes Head, was the particular Mark and
Punishment of his vain Pretensions.</p>
                  <p>This first Victory raised the Queens Heart without Impriding it: And
the new Greatness she added to it, was a Solid and Modest Greatness; a
Greatness of Designs, and Hopes, and no puffed up and vain-glorious
Greatness. Not being able to think her self Victorious, as long as the King
her Husband remained a Prisoner, she resolved to pass through all Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to break open his Prison, or expire at the Gate. This Resolution
taken, she steers her course towards <hi>London:</hi> Meets the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
who led a gallant Army, and augmented by the Defeat of the Earl of

surely it was with a sweet and pleasing Transport, that this Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Princess broke her Husbands Chains, drew him out of Prison, and
replaced the Crown upon his Head. And whatever is said in order to the
Glory of Ancient Triumphants, though they entred <hi>Rome</hi> with more Pomp

Terms from Fortune, then from so Inconstant and Wilde a Beast. He
Marched forth accompanied by his Wife, the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and all
the Body of his Party. And doubtless, if he had not made the more haste
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55122:178"/>
to get out, the least that could happen was to be shut up in the Tower of
<hi>London,</hi> and to behold from thence the Coronation of his Rival, and the
same Applauses which were before given him by all the People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward</hi> himself, though newly Crowned, did not trust to the new Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of this People; and did not believe himself sure of any thing, if
he had not Fortune and Victory on his side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He followed <hi>Henry</hi> by long
Marches: And <hi>Henry</hi> facing about, the Armies gave each other so rude and
forcible a Shock, as Thirty thousand men fell on the Place. <hi>Henry</hi> being
totally Defeated, saved himself in <hi>Scotland</hi> with the Queen: And the
Queen whose Heart was still Armed and Couragious, passed over into
<hi>France,</hi> from whence a while after, she returned into <hi>Scotland</hi> with two
thousand Men, commanded by <hi>Brezel</hi> Seneschal of <hi>Normandy. Henry</hi>
strengthened by this Succour, and that wherewith <hi>Scotland,</hi> his new Ally,
furnished him, returned again into <hi>England,</hi> with more Right and Courage,
then good Success. He was again Defeated by the Marquis of <hi>Montagne,</hi>
who Commanded King <hi>Edwards</hi> Forces: And his Overthrow was so
great, that the Queen was enforced to save her self in a Wood, with her Son
the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Event shewed, that Fortune expected her there to offer her an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front;
Not being able to overcome her Honourably, and deprive her of
Courage by a fair War, she undertook to dispossess her of it by the hands
of a Murtherer: And peradventure she had been there Assassinated, if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had not meant to sport yet longer with her, and reserve her for other
Outrages. It was no novelty with her to Dispoil a poor Queen: It is
her usual Pastime in all Countries, and at all times: And nothing is seen
every where but Ransack't Kings; nothing but denuded Princes, nothing
but Rich Men impoverished, who complain of her Robberies. But it hath
not yet hapned that a King, much less a Queen, should be so unworthily
Treated. Certain Villains, who found her in a by-corner, drawn by the
Dignity of her Countenance, and the sparkling of her Jewels and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Robbed her with so little Compassion, and used such Brutish
Violence towards her, that if any thing delivered her out of their Hands,
it was the Quarrel which arose amongst them about the division of
the Spoil.</p>
                  <p>Whilst they were fighting, the Queen whom all these frightful Faces,
and so many naked Swords could neither Terrifie nor Amaze, took up the
Prince her Son in her arms, and cast her self with him into the thickest
part of the Forrest. Another was found there, whom evidently Fortune
had placed in Ambush to do her more Injury, then all that she had already
suffered. But the Grace: and Majesty, nay the Afflicted Graces, and half
naked Majesty, were for this once more Powerful then Fortune. The
Queen seeing him approach, advanced with a stedfast pace, and a Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Authority; And presenting to him her Son, whom she carried,
said to him in Soveraign Words, and with a Commanding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Kingdom; I give thee the whole State to be carryed with him: save
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55122:179"/>

more; the Graces and Majesty spake the rest: And what is wonderfull, the
Graces without Ornament, and Majesty without a Crown and Precious
stones, humbled this Barbarous Fellow, and perswaded him that it was a
Queen who spake to him. He took the little Prince into his Armes, and
going before the Queen guided her so happily through by-ways, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently

                  <p>Truly this was a strange Game of Fortune, or to speak more Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it was a pleasing Spectacle to Providence, to behold a Great Queen,
Grand childe to so many Kings a Fugitive, half naked, and straying in a
Forrest like a Vagabond; following on foot a Thief, who alone served
for her Querries and Guards, who was all her Train and Court; and in
this deplorable Condition, which begot pitty even in Barbarity it self, to
conserve her Hopes and Resignation, and still bless Providence in whose

piece of Shipwrack, as a great Head fallen off from a great <hi>Collossus.</hi> But
though this great Head were fallen; yet it remained Entire. The Wind which
threw it down, had only displaced it: And likewise after her Fall she

                  <p>For my own part, I could not close this Gallery with the Picture of a
more Gallant and Couragious, more Active and Patient, more Resplendent
or Exemplar Vertue. You may finde Instruction there, both for Low and
High Conditions, for Prosperous and Afflicted Fortunes, for Men as well

as Women. Such as are upon the Earth, and in the Low Story of the
World, will learn from hence to Content themselves with the Repose and
Security of a mean Fortune, which is not subject to Agitations and Falls;
and not to Affect Tumult and Storms which pass over their Heads. Such
as remain in the high Region, will learn, not to make so great Account of
an Embroide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed and Tottering Greatness, exposed to Tempests and Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices,
Famous by its Shipwracks and Ruins. And when they shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that only Glittering things are subject to be broken, that elevated
Ones are liable to Falls, and such as are swoln up, do only burst asunder;
they will be affrighted with that which is the matter of their Vanity, and
will apprehend their Splendor, Elevation, and Pride. Moreover Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Fortunes are advertised hereby of their own Inconstancy and Frailty;
and the Unhappy, of the Patience they ought to have, and of the Merits
they may Acquire.</p>
                  <p>In fine, Men and Women of what Gold or Earth soever their Fortunes are
Composed, and in what Story soever of the World they are lodged, ought
to be instructed by this Example, that no Condition or lazy Vertue can be
Priviledged in this Life: That the Carreer of Adversities is open to all sort
of Persons: That Providence Assigns to every one the Rank and Function
which is proper to him: That there is no Victory which is not preceded
by some Combat; and that it is a very great shame, that Christians should
endure so many Afflictions, and expose themselves to so many Dangers
for a handfull of Flowers which last but a day; for a Perfume which is
dispersed by the first blast of Wind; for a Crown of Glass which may
break every moment: And that for Insatiable and endless Delights, and for
a Solid and Eternal Glory, they should fear to endure but the pricking of
a Thorne.</p>
