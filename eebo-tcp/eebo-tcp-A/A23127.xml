            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Cha.</hi> 1.</note> the firste que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those which you writyng vnto me intreated as by way of consultacion,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> is that the Apostle sayth, To those that bee in mariage, I commaunde, not I, but the Lorde, that a wyfe do not go from her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but if she go from him, that she remayne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried, or els be reconcyled to her husband again. And that an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande putte not away his wyfe. Whether it ought so to bee taken and vnderstonded that the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is prohibited to marye, whiche goeth from her husband without cause of fornication (for that is your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>): or els, as I thought in those bookes whiche manye
<pb facs="tcp:13674:3"/>
yeres ago I wrote vpon the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in sainct Mathewes gospell whiche our sauiour made vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mountaine, that he commaunded those women to remaine vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried which did go from their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes for that cause whiche is only permitted, that is to say, the cause of fornication. For you thynke that a woman goyng fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her husbande ought not than to marye, if she go away beyng not compelled by any fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her husband. And you considre not, if her husband geue no cause of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, that than she ought not to remaine vnmaried if she go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but she ought not at all to go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. For truely she that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to remaine vnmaried if she go from her husband, hath not the libertie of goyng awaye
<pb facs="tcp:13674:3"/>
taken from her, but the libertie to be maried. Whiche saiyng of you if it be true, than is libertie geuen to those women that be disposed to liue in continencie, not to tarry nor regarde the consent of their husbandes, that the saiyng of the Apostle, (let not a woman go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her husband) should seme to bee commaunded to theim that may chose, not continencie, but suche a deuorse as may bee lawfull to ioyne with other in mariage. Therfore it shalbe lauful to those women that loue to desyre no com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor to beare the yoke of mariage, to forsake their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes yea without any cause of fornication and accordyng to the Apostles saiyng to remain vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. And men likewyse (for there is like forme in both) if they wyl
<pb facs="tcp:13674:4"/>
liue contine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, may without the consent of their wyues forsake them, &amp; remaine without any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. For than (as you thynke) they may seke newe mariages, if the deuorse be for the cause of for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nication. But when that cause is not, than it foloweth (after your mynd) that the wyfe either ought not to go from her husband, or if she go from him, to remaine with out mariage, or els to returne to her former husband again. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whan there is no cause of for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nication, it shalbe lawful to either of theim to chose one of these thre thynges, either not to go one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, or if either parte go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to remaine so, or if they do not remain so, then not to seke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, but to returne to their former husband or wyfe againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13674:4"/>And where is than that the same Apostle would not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> either of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maryed parties shuld defraud the other in their carnall debt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cha.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> no not for a tyme, &amp; for this cause al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that they might wholy &amp; with more feruent dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce applie them selues to praier, but by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual consent? Howe shall this be saued that the Apostle sayth.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> But for fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, let euery husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d haue his wyfe, &amp; euery wife haue her husband. And let the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pay his debt to his wyfe, and like<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyse the wyfe to her husbande. The wyfe hath not power of her body but the husband, &amp; likewise the husband hath not power of his body but the wyfe. How shal this be true, except when the one partie wyll not, the other partie may not liue in continencie? For
<pb facs="tcp:13674:5"/>
if the wyfe may so put away her husband that she may remain vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maried, then the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hath not power of her body, but she her self Whiche is also vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of the husband. Moreouer when it is sayd, whosoeuer putteth awaye his wyfe,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> exceptyng the cause of fornication, maketh her to bee an adultresse: Howe shall wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande this saiyng, but that a man isprohibite to put away his wyfe, if there be no cause of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication? and it is tolde why? lest he make her to bee an adultresse. Truely therefore, because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she put not him away, but be putte away her selfe, she shall be an adultresse if she marry.</p>
            <p>Therfore for this great harme and inconuenience,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cha<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 3.</note> it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a man to putte away his
<pb facs="tcp:13674:5"/>
wyfe, but for the cause of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For then in puttyng her awaye he dothe not make her an adultresse, but putteth away an adultresse. What if the man say, I put away my wyfe without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cause of fornication, but for that he wyll liue chast, in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie: shal we therfore say that he dothe lawfully that he dothe? Who dare say so, that vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the wyll of the Lord, saiyng that he would not haue the wyfe put away, no not because the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would liue sole and chast, which excepted only the cause of fornica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion? But lette vs returne to the very wordes of the Apostle, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> To theim that bee in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age I commaunde, not I but the Lord, that the wyfe go not from her husband, but if she go, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
<pb facs="tcp:13674:6"/>
vnmaried. And let vs aske of him, &amp; as it were consult with him beyng present. Why diddest thou say O Apostle, if she go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her husband let her remayne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried? Is it lawful for her to go away from him, or is it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? If it be not lauful: why doest thou commaunde her goyng from her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to remain vnmaried? But if it bee lawfull, than truely there is a cause why it should be lawfull. This cause with no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng is founden but onely that which our sauiour excepted, that is to say, the cause of fornication. And therfore the Apostle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded not a wyfe that did go from her husband, to remaine vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, except she went from him for that cause, for whiche onely it is lawfull for a wyfe to go from her
<pb facs="tcp:13674:6"/>
husband. For where it is sayd, I commaunde her not to go away, but if she do go away, to remaine vnmaried: God forbyd that she that so goeth away that she must remaine vnmaried, should do any thyng against this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Howe therfore is she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to remaine vnmaried if she go away, except ye vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d her that may lawfully go away, which is not lawful to any wyfe, but in case her husband committe fornication? Who is it that wyll say, if a wyfe go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her husband without cause of fornication, let her remain vnmaried: seyng that she may not at all go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him but for fornication? Therefore I thynke that you nowe perceiue, howe muche this your vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng is contrarie to the bonde of
<pb facs="tcp:13674:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mariage, where God would not that continencie should bee taken on hand, but by the mutual agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of both the parties.</p>
            <p>But let vs open the matter a lytle playner,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cha.</hi> 4</note> and as it were sette the thyng before our eyes. Put the case, that continent life plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the woman, but not the man. The woman goeth from him, and begynneth to liue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently, she for her part wil liue chast, but she shal make her husband an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror (which God wyll not) because he, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will not liue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, wyll seke another woman. What shall wee say to the woman, but that the churche sayth in an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som doctrine, pay thy debt to thy husband, lest whyles thou sekest howe to be more honoured, he do fynde howe to bee damned. For
<pb facs="tcp:13674:7"/>
this would we say to him also, if he would liue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently without thy good wyll. For thou hast not power of thy body but he, like as he hath not power of his body but thou. Do not defraude one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but by comon consent. When we haue sayd these &amp; other thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that pertain to this purpose, doth it content you that the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should answer vs after your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I am obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the Apostle that sayth, I commaunde a wyfe not to go from her husband, but if she do go, to remaine vnmaried, or els to be reconciled to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Loo I haue gone from my husbande, and I wyll not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, but wyl remaine vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. For he sayth not, if she go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, lette her remaine vnmaried tyl she be reconciled to her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb facs="tcp:13674:8"/>
but let her remaine vnmaried, or els be reconciled to her husbande. And he sayth let her do either this or that. He hath permitted one of the two to be chosen, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelleth not to take the one. I haue chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to remaine vnmaried, and so do I fulfil the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. Correct me, blame me, refuse me, vse what seueritie you wyll if I do marry.</p>
            <p>What can I say again to this woman, but this. Thou doest not vnderstand the Apostle well? For he would not haue commaunded the woman to remayne vnmaried if she go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her husband, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suche a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as may lawfully go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, that is to say, for that one cause, whiche is therfore not expressed there, because it is most knowen, whiche is fornication. For god our master excepted that

they wyl say more and more that she desireth to haue a gret nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of husbandes. And by this reason you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude &amp; say.

Seyng therfore we say that it is

not lawfull for a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth away her husband for forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to marry another: and you say that it is lawful, but not expe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dient: Than w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out doubt we both say that she ought not to marrye that putteth away her husband for fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce there is, that when both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be christened, wee say that a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> puttyng away her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for fornication, may not marry an other, and that she may not put away her husband without the cause of fornication. But you say that a woman may not marry an other, if she put away her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d without any cause of fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, But if she do putte him away for that cause, that than it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for her to marry, because of the shame and reproche. And
<pb facs="tcp:13674:10"/>
so you permit a woman that shal not marry, to go from her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d be he a fornicator or none at all.</p>
            <p>But because the Apostle or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ by the Apostle dothe not permitte a woman to go from her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that is no fornicator,<note place="margin">

For she of whom it is sayd, if she go away let her not marry: is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnder that condicion to go away that she should not marry. If therfore she chose not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there is no cause why she shuld be prohibited to go away, as she of whom it is sayd, if she liue not continently, let her marry, and so is permitted to liue not contine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly vpon this condicion that she mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. If therfore she chose to marry

she cannot be compelled to liue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinently. Lyke as a woman refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng to liue continently, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to marry, that her inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent life may not be damnable: so she goyng fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her husband is com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pelled to remain vnmaried, that her goyng away may be not cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. But she shall be culpable if she go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her husband without fornication, although she remain vnmaried. Therfore she is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to remayne vnmaried, if she go away, that goeth away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a fornicator. Seyng these thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be thus, if we vnderstand the Apostle after that sorte, that we say to women, go not from your chast husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, but if ye wyl go, see that ye remain vnmaried: than wyll all those that delite to liue continently: suppose that they

not in that sermon I expounded, but in another place. Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer putteth awaye his wyfe but for the cause of fornication, and marieth another, committeth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultery: if we vnderstande it this waye, that whosoeuer putteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his wyfe for fornication and marieth another doth not commit adultery: Than it semeth in this matter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is not like forme &amp; reason betwene the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; the wyfe, because the wyfe although she go from her husband for forni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation, &amp; marieth another, yet she doth adultery: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his wyfe awaye for the same cause &amp; marieth another, doth no adulteri.

<pb facs="tcp:13674:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And that there is like forme in this matter betwene the man &amp; the wyfe, the Apostle sheweth there (wherof I must often make mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) wher when he had sayd, the wyfe hath not power of her owne body, but the man, he added and sayd likewyse, the man hath not power of his owne body, but the woman.</p>
            <p>Than (say you) why did Christ adde to his saiyng,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cha.</hi> 9</note> the cause of fornication, &amp; did not rather say generally, whosoeuer putteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his wyfe &amp; marieth another committeth adultery, if he also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitteth adultery whiche putting awaye his wyfe for fornication, marieth another? I thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke because Christe would make mencion of that whiche is the greater fault. For who denieth but it is more
<pb facs="tcp:13674:13"/>
adultery to putte his wyfe away without cause of fornication and marry another, than puttyng her away for fornication to marry an other, not because this is no adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, but because it is lesse adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the fyrst wyfe put away for fornication the second is maried. For sainct Iames the Apostle vsing a like speche, sayth To him that knoweth to do well and do not, it is synne. Is it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no synne to him that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not to do well, and therfore doth it not? yes truely it is synne, but this is greater, if he bothe knowe, and do not. And this is not therfore no synne, because it is lesse. But to speake then both after one sort, like as whosoeuer putteth away his wife, excepting the cause of fornication, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
<pb facs="tcp:13674:13"/>
another, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Euen so whosoeuer knoweth good &amp; doth it not, synneth. But like as it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be well sayd here therfore if he knowe not, he syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, (for there be also sinnes of those that bee ignoraunt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thei be lesse than of those that knowe: Euen so it can not be well sayd there, Therfore if he putteth away his wife for forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and maryeth another, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth no adultery. For there is adultery also of theim whiche marry other, forsakyng their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wyues for fornication, but yet lesse than of those that marry other, forsakyng their wyues not for fornication. For like as it is sayd, to him that knoweth good and dothe it not, it is synne: euen so this also may bee sayd, to him
<pb facs="tcp:13674:14"/>
that forsaketh his wife without cause of fornication and maryeth another, it is adultery. Therfore like as if we say, whosoeuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth a woman that is forsaken of her husband not for fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth adultery, without doubt we say true: and yet we do not deliuer him from that cryme that marieth a woman whiche is putte awaye for fornication, but doubte not but bothe bee adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Euen so we pronounce him an adulteror, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out cause of fornication forsaketh his wyfe &amp; marieth another, and yet wee doo not therfore defend him from the spot of that cryme, that putteth away his wyfe for fornication &amp; maryeth another. For although one be more than another, yet we knowe theim bothe to be adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
<pb facs="tcp:13674:14"/>
For there is no man so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, that wyll deny him to bee an adulteror that marieth a woman whom her husband hath put away for fornication, when he wyll call him an adulteror that maryeth her that is putte awaye without fornication. After this sorte therfore these be both adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terors. Wherfore when we say, whosoeuer maryeth her who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her husband hath put away without cause of fornication, committeth adultery: we speake it of one of theim, &amp; yet do not therfore deny him to bee an adulteror that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth her whom her husband hath putte away for fornication. So when both be adulterors, that is to say, both he that puttethaway his wyfe without cause of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and maryeth another, and
<pb facs="tcp:13674:15"/>
also he that puttyng awaye his wyfe for fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, coupleth him selfe to another: Truely when we reade this of one of them, we may not vnderstande it so, as though by him the other wer denyed to be an adulteror, because he is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. But if sainct Mathewe the Euangelist make this hard to be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, by expressyng the one kynde, and kepyng in silence the other: did not the other Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d both so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that it may be vnderstanded of bothe? For in sainct Markes gospel it is thus written, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer putteth away his wyfe, and maryeth another, committeth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultery vpon her: and if the wyfe putteth away her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and bee maryed to another, she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth adulterye. And in sainct Lukes
<pb facs="tcp:13674:15"/>
gospel thus. Euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth away his wyfe, and maryeth another, is an adulteror, and he that marieth her that is put away of her husbande, is an adulteror. Than what are wee that do say, there is one that puttyng awaye his wife &amp; mariyng another, is an adulteror, And there is another that doyng the same thyng is no adulteror: seyng the gospel sayth, euery manne is an adulteror that doth it. Therefore if whosoeuer dothe it, that is to say, puttyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his wyfe, maryeth another, is an adulteror: without doubte than they bee bothe adulterors, both he that without fornication and he that for fornication put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth away his wyfe. For that is, whosoeuer putteth away, that is to say, euery one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> putteth away.</p>

And I suppose therefore because this sentence may bee thought there to be explicated, in this that is sayd before. He maketh her to commit adultery. Howe can she that is put away bee made an adultresse except he that shal mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry her be made an adulteror?</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by sainct Mathewe, may bee vnderstanded by other Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes. Wherfore when we reade in sainct Mathewes gospel, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer putteth awaye his wyfe but for fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or rather this that is red in the greke text, besyde the cause of fornication, and marieth another, is an adulteror: Wee ought not by &amp; by to thynke him no adulteror, that for the cause of fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> putteth away his wife and maryeth another, but yet bee in doubt tyl we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sult and reade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel of other Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelistes that

E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man that putteth away his wyfe and maryeth another, is an adulteror. And because it is not lawfull to say the Euangelistes do not agree in one sence and one vnderstandyng, althoughe they speake of one thyng in dyuers wordes, therfore we must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, that it pleased sainct Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew
<pb facs="tcp:13674:19"/>
to signifie the whole by the part, and to be of the same mynde, not that one man that putteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his wyfe, and maryeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is to say, he that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her away beside the cause of fornication is an adulteror, and another man that putteth away hiswife for fornitation, is no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulteror, but euery man that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth away his wife and maryeth another, should not bee doubted, but that he is an adulteror.</p>
            <p>For that also that foloweth in sainct Luke,<note place="margin">

For if he haue carnal copu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation
<pb facs="tcp:13674:19"/>
with his owne wyfe, and not with another mannes wyfe, than commytteth he no adultery. But he doth commytte adultery. Therfore she is another mannes wife with whom he kepeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Moreouer if she be another mannes wyfe, that is to say, his wife that put her awai, although she bee put away for fornication, yet she ceasseth not to be the wife of him that did putte her away. But if she cease to bee his wyfe, than is she wyfe to him that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her the tyme. And if she bee his wyfe, then is not he to bee iudged an adulteror, but an husband.

what woman soeuer he maryeth that putteth awaye his former wyfe for fornication, she is an adulteresse, because she compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth with another wyues hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.

all thynges be not expedient, all thinges be lawfull, but all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges do not edifye. Let no manne seeke that is his owne, but that is another mannes. And to shew wherof he spake, he sayd: What soeuer is solde in the market, eat of it, askyng &amp; serchyng nothyng for conscience sake.

            <p>But in suche thynges that be of this sorte,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:13674:23"/>
It may not be sayd in them, this is good, but that is better, as it is sayd:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> He that geueth his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn to mariage doth well, and he that geueth not his virgyn to mariage dothe better, for there both be lawful, and the one som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes, somtymes the other is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For to those women that liue not syngle cotinently, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pedient to marry, &amp; so that is law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full, is expedient. But to theim that haue vowed continencie, it is neither lawfull nor expedient. Moreouer it is lawfull to go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an infidele husband, but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. And to remain with him if he consent to dwel with her, is both lawfull and expedient. For if it were not lawful it could not be expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. One thyng therfore may be lawfull, and not expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:
<pb facs="tcp:13674:23"/>
But it can not be expedient that is vnlawfull. And for that cause not all lawfull thynges be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, but all vnlawfull thynges be not expedient. For lyke as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that is redemed by the bloudde of Christ, is a man or a woman: but not euery one that is a man or a woman is redemed by the bloudde of Christ: Euen so euery thyng that is not lauful is not expedient, but not euery thyng that is not expedient is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vnlawfull. For there be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thynges that be not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as we haue learned by the Apostles testimony.</p>
            <p>But it is herd to define by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vniuersal rule,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cha.</hi> 16</note> what differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is betwene that is vnlawful and therfore not expedient, and that is lawful and yet not expedient.
<pb facs="tcp:13674:24"/>
For a man wyll soone say, euery thyng that is not expedient to be done, is synne, but euery sinne is vnlawful, therfore euery thyng not expedient, is vnlawfull. And than where be those thinges the Apostle sayth be lawful, but not expedient, if euery thyng that is not expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be vnlawful? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, because we may not doubte but the Apostle sayd true, and we dare not say that any synnes be lawfull: Than it foloweth wee must say, that some thing is done that is not expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; yet if it be lawfull it is not synne, although it be not to be done, because it is not expedient. But if it bee thought an absurditee, that any thyng should be done that is not expedient, and that he should be sayd not to haue synned that did
<pb facs="tcp:13674:24"/>
it: we must vnderstand that it is called an absurditee by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> custome of speche, which custom of speche extendeth so farre, that we say, beastes hauyng no reason ought to bee beaten when they faut or synne. But to synne, properly per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayneth to nothyng but to him that vseth the reasonable election of frewyl, whiche among al mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal liuyng creatures, is geuen to none but to manne. But it is one thyng when we speake properly, and another thyng when wee bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe wordes either by abusyng of them, or els by translation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other thynges.</p>
            <p>That we may therfore labor (if we can) by some propre differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to put distinction betwene that is lawfull and not expedient,<note place="margin">

expedient: Me thinke, those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be lawful and not expedient, whiche by righteousnes be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before God, but for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of men, ought to bee auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, least therby they bee stopped from saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and those thynges be vnlawfull and therfore not ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that be forbidden by righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes it selfe to be done at all, although thei be praised of those to whose knowledge they bee brought. Whiche thyng if it be so, than onely vnlawful thynges be prohibited of God, that thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges lawfull &amp; not expedient, may bee auoyded not by the bonde of lawe, but by the free beneuolence of mans discrecion. Therfore if it were not lawful to put away the infidele husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or wyfe, the lord would haue forbydden it to bee

done, and the Apostle forbiddyng it would not haue sayd, I say, not the Lord. For if the man be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to bee separated from his wyfe for the cause of fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: howe muche more ought the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to detest and abhorre in his wyfe the fornication of the mynde, that is to say, infidelitie, of the which it is written:<note place="margin">Psal. 72</note> Because loo they that make them selues farre from the, shall perishe.

            <p>But because it is after that sorte lawfull,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cha,</hi> 18</note> that it is not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, least menne beyng offended for the separation of their wyfes, should abhorre the doctrine of sal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uacion, by whiche vnlauful thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be prohibited, and so remain worse &amp; worse in their infidelitie
<pb facs="tcp:13674:26"/>
to their owne damnacion: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle is an intercessor, and by admonishment forbiddeth to be done, that is lawfull in that sorte that it is not expedient. For christen men and women be euen in lyke sorte not forbydden of the Lorde to go from their infidele wyfes and husbandes, as they be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. For if they were commaunded to put away suche wyues &amp; husbandes: than there should be no place left to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail of the Apostle that admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thyng should not be done. For a good seruant would by no meanes forbid a thing to be done that the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth. For the Lorde ones by Esdras the prophet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded it to be done,<note place="margin">1. Es. 10.</note> and it was done. The Israelites all that than had any, put away
<pb facs="tcp:13674:26"/>
their wyfes that wer straungers borne of another stocke, by which wyfes the men were seduced and led to straunge goddes, and not the women were won &amp; brought to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true god by their husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. For as yet the great grace of our sauiour did not shyne, &amp; the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of that people didgape and looke for the temporal promises of the olde testament. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they sawe those men also that worshypped many false gods abound in worldly goodes whiche they looked for at the Lordes hand as a great reward, by the flattery of their wyues. First they were afrayde to offend those false goddes, and afterward were induced to worship theim. Wherfore the Lorde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by the holy man Moyses, that no
<pb facs="tcp:13674:27"/>
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should marry a wyfe beyng a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger born. Therfore by good right they did put away at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, those wyues they maried against the Lordes commaundement. But when the gospel bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be preached to the Gentyles it found one Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tile ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to another, of whom if both the parties dyd not receiue the fayth, but the man or the woman beyng an infidele dyd consent to dwel with the other parte beyng christened: Neither the christian ought to be prohibited of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde to put away the infidele, nor yet to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. For she ought not to bee prohibited, because iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice suffereth to go away from a fornicator, &amp; an infidele ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath in his harte the greater fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: nor his chastitee with his

wyfe can not bee called true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause whatsoeuer is not of fayth is synne, although a christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may haue true chastitie with an infidele husband that hath no true chastitie. Therfore the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians ought not to be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be separated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> infideles, because they were bothe maryed beyng Gentiles, not against the commaundement of the Lorde. Seyng than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byddeth nor commaundeth the christian to go from the infidele: Therfore, that the christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shuld not go away, not the Lord, but the Apostle sayth, hauyng the holy ghost in whom he is able to geue fruitful and faythfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail. Wherfore when he had sayd of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whose husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was dead, she shal be more happi, if she
<pb facs="tcp:13674:28"/>
remaine so, after my counsail: lest any man might thynke this to be contemned as mannes counsail &amp; not as Goddes, he added after, I thynke verely that I haue the spirit of God. We must therfore vnderstand that the thinges that be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded of the Lorde, but be fruitfully cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sailed of his seruaunt, be counsailed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the same Lord. God forbyd that any Catholike man say, when the holy ghost dothe counsail, that the Lord doth not counsail: seyng that he also is the Lord, &amp; the workes of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie be inseparable. Yet he sayth, (concernyng virgynes I haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the Lord,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> but geue counsail, not that we shuld thynke this counsail came not of the Lorde, seyng it foloweth by
<pb facs="tcp:13674:28"/>
and by, and he sayth. As hauyng obtained mercy of the Lord to be a faythfull counsailor. By God therfore he geueth a faythful cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sail in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sayth. I thinke that I also haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit of God. Notwithstandyng the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement of the Lord is one thyng, and the faythfull counsail of the seruaunt accordyng to the mercyful gyft of charitee whiche is inspired &amp; geuen to him of the Lord, is another thyng. There to doo otherwyse is not lawfull, here it is lawful, but so that the thyng lauful, is partly expedient, partly not expedient. It is than expedient, when not only by righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teousnes before god it is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but also when men receiue of it no impediment to saluation: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to do otherwise, (that is
<pb facs="tcp:13674:29"/>
to say, to marry and embrace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage whiche is good, but lesse than continency) is both lawful &amp; expedient. Because it so releueth by the honesty of mariage the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleshe whiche is euer prone to fal to al vnlawful thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that it stoppeth no man from saluacion, although it wer more expedient &amp; more honest, if a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn would take that counsail, whervnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel her. Than also a lauful thyng is not expedient, when it is permitted, but the vse of that libertie and power, bryngeth to other an impediment of saluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of this sort is (wherof we haue spoken long) the departyng of a christian man or wife from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidele, whiche the Lord forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not by commaundement of
<pb facs="tcp:13674:29"/>
lawe, bycause it is not vniust be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hym: but the Apostle forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it by the counsel of charytie bicause it is to the infidels an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment of saluacion, not onely for that they be very perniciously offended: but also for that when they fall and ioyne theim selues in other maryages their wyues beyng alyue that put them away before, than they be with muche difficultie loosed and pulled from suche adulterouse maryages, as they be bounden vnto.</p>
            <p>Therefore here where that is lawefull is not expedyent,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cha.</hi> 19</note> it may not bee sayd, yf she putte awaye the infidell, she dothe well, yf she put him not awaye, she doth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: as it is sayd, he that gyueth to maryage doth wel, and he that dothe not gyue to maryage dothe
<pb facs="tcp:13674:30"/>
better. For in that second part not onely both be lawfull, &amp; therfore to neither of them any manne is compelled by Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but also both be expedient, the one lesse, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other more, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to that is more expedient, by the Apostles counsell euery man that may is prouoked to take it. But this where the questyon is concernynge the puttynge away or not puttyng awaye of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideles wyfe or husband? both be lyke laweful by that ryghtwyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whiche is before God, and therefore the Lorde forbyddeth neyther of them: but yet both be not expedient for the infyrmities of men, and therfore the Apostle forbiddeth that is not expedient, the Lord geuyng him free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to forbyd, for neither that the
<pb facs="tcp:13674:30"/>
Apostle counsaileth, the lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byddeth, nor that the Apostle for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>byddeth, the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth. Whiche thyng if it were not so, neither the Apostle would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail any thyng against the lordes prohibition, nor would forbyd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thyng against the Lordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. Wherfore in these two causes, the one concernyng mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng and not mariyng, the other concernyng puttyng away or not putting away the infidele partie: In the Apostles wordes there is some thyng like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some thyng vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. The lyke thyng is that both there he sayth, I haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the Lord, but do geue counsail, and here he sayth: I say, not the Lorde. For this saiyng, I haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Lord, is like to this, The
<pb facs="tcp:13674:31"/>
Lord sayth not. and this saiyng, I counsail, is lyke to this, I say. But this is vnlyke that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng mariyng and not mariyng, it may be sayd, this is well done, that is better, because both be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; the one lesse, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other more But concernyng the puttyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way or not puttyng away of the infidele partie, it may not be sayd he that putteth away doth well, &amp; he that putteth not away dothe better, but it must be said, let him not put away, for althoughe it be laweful, yet it is not expediente. Thus we may saye, it is better not to put away the infydle wife or husbande, although it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to put hym or her away euen as we say well, it is better, that is lawful and expedye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then that is lawful and not expediente.</p>

To other I saye,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7</note> not the Lorde, counsellyng those that had infidel wyfes not to put them away, if they consented to dwel with them.

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded there shuld be no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages made with theim that be of a diuers religion, &amp; ye brought in the testimony of the Lord, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng: Thou shalt not take a wyfe to thy sonne of the doughters of straungers borne,<note place="margin">Deut. 7.</note> least she leade him after her gods, and his soule perishe. You did also adde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the Apostle wher he sayth: A woman is bounden so long as her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d liueth. But if her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band be dead, she is free to marry whom she wyll, onely in the lord. Which you expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded so, that you added, that is to say, to a christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you added further. This is therfore the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Lord aswell in the old testament as in the newe, that no parties should remaine beyng coupled in mariage except they be of one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion &amp; faith. Than if this be the
<pb facs="tcp:13674:33"/>
Lordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement bothe in the olde testament and the newe, and if the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde it and the Apostle teache it, that no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage remaine coupled but of one religion and fayth: Why than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the lordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, against his own doctrin, against the precept of the olde testament and the newe, dothe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund, not only cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>saileth but also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth, that if the husband or wyfe receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayth, the one should not put away the other beyng an infidele if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidele consent to dwel with him? By these your wordes you shew euidently inough that this is one thyng and that another. For that (as you say) the Lord byddeth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle teacheth, both the testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde. But this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother matter, who can denye?
<pb facs="tcp:13674:34"/>
where it is intreated, not of those that are to be maried, but of those that be already maried. For thei wer both of one infidelitie when they were maryed, but when the gospel came, the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without the wife, or the wife without the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receyued the fayth. Than if this be a diuers thyng, as it appereth without any scruple or doubte: why doth not the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund as the Apostle doth, that the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian should remaine in mariage with the infidele, except peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

laye the matter as it were before your eies to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered. Behold ther be two maried persons, both infidels when they were maried: in these two there is no question that can perteine to the lordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandement, and the Apostles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the precept of the olde and newe testament, whereby a Christian is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ioyne in mariage with an infidel, for now they be man and wife and as yet bothe be infidels, as yet they be such as thei were before they ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ried, and as they were maried. the precher of the gospel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, one of them he or she receyueth the faith, but so that the other infidel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>senteth to dwel with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, whether doth the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde the Chrystyan to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the infidel, or not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund? yf you say he commaundeth: the
<pb facs="tcp:13674:35"/>
Apostle gain saith, I saye, not the Lorde. If you say he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, I aske the cause why. You wyl not aunswere the cause which you put in your letters, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord forbiddeth Christians to be maried to infidels: for that is no cause in this matter where we speke of perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s maried, not of persons to be maried. If therfore you haue found no cause why the Lorde shulde not forbid that the Apostle forbiddeth, (for you see nowe as I suppose, that it is no cause which you thought before was one) then consyder whether this be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause which I thought was it, and was then to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and now to be defended, that the Lorde sayth that thinge, whiche rightwisnes before him permyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, which may not be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by any meanes, that is to say,
<pb facs="tcp:13674:35"/>
whiche the Lord so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth or forbiddeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not lawfull at all to do otherwyse. For what thyng he permitteth to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of mans free wyl, either to do or not to doo lawfully: therin he semeth to geue place to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail of his seruauntes, that they shuld rather cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel that they shal see expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Let this rule be first and specially kept, that no vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful thynges be done. And where any thyng is lawefull after that sorte, that to do otherwyse is not altogether vnlawful: Than let it be done that is expedient, or that is more expedient. For that the Lord sayth as the Lord, that is to say, not by the aduice of a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailor, but by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of a ruler, it is not lawfull to do those thynges, &amp; therfore not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. The lord comaundeth a
<pb facs="tcp:13674:36"/>
woman not to go away from her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but if she go away, (that is to say, for that cause for whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che it is lauful so to do) to remain vnmaried or els to be reconciled to her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For a maryed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, her husband beyng aliue, is bounden to the lawe, and duryng his life she shalbe called an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse, if she be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> another hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, because the woman is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den so long as her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d liueth. Wherfore if a wife put away her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; marierh another, she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth adultery, and he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth her that is put fro her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, is an adulteror. And so by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the lord, let a man not put away his wife, for he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> putteth away his wyfe without cause of fornication, ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth her to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte adultery, but if he put her away for that cause, yet let him remain so.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:13674:36"/>For euery man that putteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his wyfe &amp; marieth another is an adulteror.<note place="margin">

doth well. And also, the woman shalbe more happy if she remaine so, whiche when her husband is dead hath in her libertie to marry whom she wyll, only in the Lord which may be taken two wayes, either remainyng a christian, or mariyng a christian.

another question of them that be alredi ioyned, let the Apostle here also be hard saie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, if any brother haue an infidel to his wife, and if she consent to dwel with him, let him not put her away: and if any woman haue an infidel to her hus<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bande and if he consent to dwell with her, let her not put hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away And let hym be herde so, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe it is lawful to be done, bicause the lorde saith it not: yet let it not be done, bicause it is not expediente.

So that for euery kind of fornicacion, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the fleshe, or of the spirite (where also infydelitye is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed) both it is not lauful for a woman, putting awaye her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to marry an other man, and

also it is not lauful for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng away his wyfe to marry an other, because the lord saith with out any exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Then howe can it be true, that a woman is bownden so longe as her husbande liuethe? Behold her husband liueth, because he is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther departed oute of his body,
<pb facs="tcp:13674:48"/>
nor yet hathe committed fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (which you wold haue repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for deathe): and yet the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nowe no more bownden vnto hym. Doo you not marke howe directly this is agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ste y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle, saiynge, a woman is bownden so long as her husbande lyuethe? or wyl you perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce say, that he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uethe, but yet he is not her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? for than he ceased to be her husbande, when she, by adulterye, dissolued the bond of mariage. Than howe shall she duringe her husbandes lyfe, be called an adul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tresse, yf she be wyth an other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, seying that her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is not now her husband, the bond of matry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie beying dissolued by the wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s adultery? For duryng which husbandes lyfe, shall she be called an adultresse, yf she be with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

man but her own husbande? But yf he cease to be her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, than truely she shall not be called an adultresse duringe her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And say not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the dead man or dead wife, may in this place be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for the man or wife co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittinge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery. Wherfor after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holsom doctrine &amp; teachinge, the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is bownden so longe as her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d lyuethe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, is not departed oute of hys body. For a woman maried
<pb facs="tcp:13674:49"/>
be of the Apostles mind, that we say not, a man committing adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, is to be counted as a dead man, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> therfor it is lawful for his wife to marye an other man. For although adulterie be death, not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodye, but of the soule, whiche is worse: yet the Apostle spake not of that deathe, when he sayd, yf her husband be dead, she may marie to whom she will: but of that onely deathe wherby a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> departeth oute of his bodye. For yf by the mans adulterie, the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of matrimonye be dissolued: than foloweth that absurditie, which I tolde before ought to be auoided, that the wife also by her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shuld be loosed from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bond, &amp; yf she be loosed, she is free from the law of her husband, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for (which thing is moste foulish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:13674:49"/>
spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) she shall be no adultresse yf she be with an other man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by her own adultery she is departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her former husband. Which thinge yf it be so far wide of truthe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man, (I speake not onely of Christianes,) but no com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men wit will admit it: than truely the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is bownden so long as her husband liueth, and to speake more plainly, so long as her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is in his bodye. And after lyke forme and maner, the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is bownden, so longe as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyuethe, in her bodye. For whiche cause, yf he wil put away the adul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tresse, let hym not marye an other woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, leste he him selfe doo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he blameth in his wif. Likewise yf the woman put hym awaye, let her not couple her selfe to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for she is bownden so longe

as her husband lyueth nor she is not delyuered from the law of her husbande (except he be dead) that she be no adulteresse, if she be with on other man.</p>

to be vnder the lawes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, than of Christe, because the ciuill lawes of the world seme to bynde men not with the same bondes of chastitie, that they bynd women: let them read what Antonius the Emperour, whiche was no Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten man, dyd constitute and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyn concernynge thys matier, wher the husbande is not suffred to accuse the wife for the cryme of adulterie, to whom he hathe not in hys liuinge gyuen example of chastitie, so that bothe shulde be condemned yf that contention did proue them bothe alyke to haue been vnchaste.

They shal haue before their eyes authorytie to inquyre, whether you lyuynge chastely, haue been author for her to lyue likewise well and chastely or no? For it semethe to me very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, that the man shulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire chastitie of hys wife, whiche he hym selfe wyll not performe: which thing may bothe condemne the man, and for mutuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of bothe their crymes, make an end of the matier betwen them both, or els take away the

yf many of gods ministers take sodenly and at vnwares, thys of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that is laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, hoping that they shall more bryghtly shyne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inheritaunce of Christe howe moche more oughte you, beinge ware of adulteries, to lyue continently, fearinge not to shyne lesse in the kyngdome of god, but to burn more in the fyre of hell.
