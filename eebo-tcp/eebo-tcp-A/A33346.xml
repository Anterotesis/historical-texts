            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Take the boldness to present you with these <hi>Narratives,</hi> not for that they are new, or supposing your selves to be strangers to them: but
<pb facs="tcp:95887:5"/>
as a Testimony of my Gratitude for these favours I have received from you: The high Heavens may be seen in the lowest valleys: So may a large heart in the least Gift. But truly though the Gift be worthless, yet so is not the matter contained in it, which sets forth such eminent and signal deliverances as no Church or people in these latter Ages of the world have received; And there must be a recognition of Gods mercies, or else there will neither follow estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor retribution: Hence <hi>Micah 6.5. O my people</hi> (saith God many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years after) <hi>remember now what</hi> Balack <hi>King of</hi> Moah <hi>consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and what</hi> Balaam <hi>the Son of</hi> Beor <hi>answered him from</hi> Shittim <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Gilgal, <hi>that ye may know the righteousness of the Lord.</hi> If there be not such a recognition of former deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, we that should be as Temples of his praise, shall be as graves of his benefits. Our souls indeed are too like filthy Ponds, wherein fish die soon, and
<pb facs="tcp:95887:5"/>
frogs live long: Rotten stuff is remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, memorable mercies are forgotten; whereas the soul should be as an holy <hi>Ark;</hi> the memory as the pot of <hi>Manna,</hi> preserving holy truths and special mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; as <hi>Aarons Rod,</hi> fresh and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing. Oh! let us imitate that man after Gods own heart! If the Lord will be <hi>Davids</hi> shepherd, he will dwel in Gods house to all perpetuity, <hi>Psalm. 23.1, 6.</hi> If God deal bountifully with him, he will sit down and bethink himself what to render for all his benefits, <hi>Psalm 116.7, 12.</hi> A Christian counts all that he can do for God by way of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, but a little of that much he could beteem him; and thinks nothing more unbeseeming him than to bury the mercies of God in oblivion. His two mites of <hi>Thankfulness</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> he dayly presents, and then cryes out as that poor <hi>Grecian</hi> did to the Emperour, <hi>If I had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter present thou shouldest be sure of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95887:6"/>What then may we judge of those persons in our daies, who labour to extenuate, yea annihilate these delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances? that would have no publick commemorations of them, that study how to invalidate them, and to blot out the remembrance of them? To render good for evil is Divine: Good for good is Humane: Evil for evil is brutish: But evil for good is Devillish. Yet alas! how ordinary an evil is this among us, to abuse our deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Gods' dishonour? But <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people, and unwise? Is not he thy Father? he hath bought thee, &amp;c. Deut. 32.6.</hi> Should we not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that good turns aggravate unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and our offences are not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle encreased by our obligations? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful persons are like the Snake in the Fable, who said to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man when he had shewed it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: <hi>Summum praemium pro sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo beneficio est ingratitudo.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
<pb facs="tcp:95887:6"/>
is the greatest reward of the greatest benefit.</p>
                  <p>How many such Snakes have we amongst us, that return evil for good, and unkindness for kindness? Is not this to fight against God, with his own weapons? as <hi>David</hi> did against <hi>Goliah:</hi> as <hi>Jehu</hi> did against <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>: and as <hi>Benhadad</hi> did against <hi>Ahab,</hi> with that life that he had lately given him? for the preventing whereof (if it may be) are these things published, being almost worn out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance more than the very names of them. Besides, though they may be found in larger volumes, yet are they not so fit for every Family: And as I have presumed (honourable and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) to publish them udder your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, so I doubt not but they will find the better entertainment for the same. My earnest desire and prayer for you is that <hi>the God of Peace will fill you with all joy and peace by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> multiplying his Blessings upon
<pb facs="tcp:95887:7"/>
you and yours: And that you would afford me a room in your <hi>Albe</hi> among those that</p>

                  <p>But that we may the better see what induced the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to make this hostile Invasion, we must be informed: both who were the inciters, and by what arguments, and artifices, they stirred him up thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                  <p>The Inciters were the Pope, and some traiterous <hi>English</hi> Fugitives who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in <hi>Spain,</hi> and at <hi>Rome.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was, <hi>The Conquest of England</hi>; which had been hindred for the space of ten years by reason of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Wars in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> The Arguments were, that seeing God had blessed the King of <hi>Spain</hi> with admirable Blessings and Successes; had given him in <hi>Portugal,</hi> the <hi>East Indies,</hi> and very many rich Islands belonging to the same; that he should therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form somewhat that might be acceptable to God (the giver of so great and good things) and most worthy the Power, and Majesty of the Catholick King: That the Church of God could not be more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, nor meritoriously propagated, than by the conquest of <hi>England,</hi> extirpating Heresie, and planting the Catholick Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Religion there.

would be most just and necessary; conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the Queen of <hi>England</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and persisted contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous against the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> That she supported the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Rebels in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> annoyed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with continual depredations; surprised, and sacked his Towns in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> and had very lately put the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to death, therein violating the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of all Kings.</p>
                  <p>Again, that this War would be no less profitable than just; For hereby he might add to his Empire other flourishing Kingdoms, extinguish the Rebellion in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> hitherto fomented and supported from <hi>England</hi>; secure his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages from both the <hi>Indies,</hi> and abate his vast expences in convoying his <hi>Indian</hi> Fleets both forward and backward: For proof whereof (they suggested) that the <hi>English</hi> Navy was neither for number, nor greatness, nor strength comparable to that of <hi>Spain</hi>; especially having the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> Fleet now annexed unto it. That <hi>England</hi> was not fortified, and it wanted Commanders: Souldiers, a Cavalry, and Ammunition; was bare of Wealth, and Friends. That there were many in all parts of it addicted to the <hi>Romish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95887:9"/>
and would upon the first opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity joyn their forces with his. In brief, that so great was the strength of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> and so unmatchable was their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that no man durst oppose against them, and therefore they might confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assure themselves of victory. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that now an opportunity was afforded by God himself to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to effectuate this great design, having no cause to fear any other enemies, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a Truce lately concluded by him-with the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> (his old enemies) being now embroiled in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars at home. They perswaded him likewise that <hi>England</hi> was an easier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest than the <hi>Netherlands</hi>: For that he had a shorter cut to it by Sea, and that an open Sea: neither was it so fortified with Cities, Castles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the <hi>Netherlands</hi> were: and that <hi>England</hi> being once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, the <hi>Netherlands</hi> would soon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of course, having lost their best sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter.</p>
                  <p>These, and such like arguments prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the next place they held a serious Consultation about the manner of Invading <hi>England. Don Avares Bassano,</hi> Marquiss of <hi>Sancta Cruce</hi>; who was to command the <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95887:9"/>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95887:10"/>
advised that some Port-Town in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or <hi>Zealand</hi> should suddenly be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Land For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (who was then Governor of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi> under the King of <hi>Spain</hi>) and by some <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships sent to assist him by Sea, that so the great Fleet might have an Harbour from whence to begin their Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: with whom agreed in opinion the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> himself, who was very forward to promote this expedition. But others opposed this by reason of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, danger, expence of time, and vast charge that it would require. They held that with the same charge <hi>England</hi> might easier be won, and that the Conquest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would be assured, if a well-appointed Army out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Counties</hi> might be landed at the <hi>Thames</hi> mouth, and <hi>London</hi> (the Metropolis of <hi>England</hi>) surprised by a sudden assault. And this opinion, as the more probable, prevailed. And then again it was advised by some, that War should first be denounced by an Herald, both to remove suspicion and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie from neighbour Princes, and to drive our Queen to call in forraign Forces to assist Her: hoping that according to the insolent manner of mercenaries, they would raise mutinies, and spoil the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb facs="tcp:95887:10"/>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95887:11"/>
which would make the Queens Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects evil affected towards Her, so that all things would grow into confusion in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But this motion was not hearkened to by men grown fierce, insolent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of their own strength, only they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the blessing of the Pope upon their <hi>Armado,</hi> and the prayers of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks to God and the Saints for good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. And to strike the greater terror into the hearts of the <hi>English,</hi> They set forth Books with printed Maps, wherein was expressed the greatness of their Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in each particular, which indeed was so great in <hi>Spain, Portugal, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at it, and procured the Pope to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten it by the name of the <hi>Invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado.</hi>

                  <p>Thus we see what preparations were made both at Sea and Land; at <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> for the subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>England,</hi> extirpating the Gospel, and subjugating us under the yoke of <hi>Spain</hi>: now let us see what provision and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons our Queen made to dispel this black cloud that hung over our head: And truly the first thing that she did was most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; For as when <hi>Jehosophat</hi> was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the like danger. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20.3. He sought the Lord and proclaimed a fast; so did She, requiring all her subjects to humble themselves by fasting and prayer, knowing that these are the best weapons of the Church, that they by them might seek unto the Lord, and say in the words of <hi>Jehosophat, O Lord God, art not thou God in Heaven? and rulest not thou over all the Kingdoms of the Earth? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee? O our God, wilt thou not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95887:15"/>
judge them? For we have no might against this great company that cometh against us, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi> But in the second place, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Prayers without endeavours and means are like <hi>Rachel, beautiful but barren,</hi> that She might not be taken unprovided, She prepared with all diligence as strong a Fleet as She could, and all things necessary for War; and She that in discerning mens parts and abilities was of a most sharp judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ever most happy, having the free choice in her self, and not by the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of others, assigned to every office by name the best and fittest men.</p>
                  <p>The charge of her Navy she committed to <hi>Charles Howard</hi> of <hi>Effingham,</hi> Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>England,</hi> of whose skill she had had former experience, and whom she knew both by his Moderation and Nobility, to be wary in providence, valiant industrious, and of great authority among the Seamen, and well beloved of them: Her Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral she made the famous Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and these she sent to the West parts of <hi>England</hi>; and for the Guard of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas, she appointed <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> second son to the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> whom she commanded also to lie upon the Coasts of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> with forty
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95887:16"/>
Ships, to watch that the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> might not come forth with his forces: By Land She commanded the General forces of the Realm to be mustered, trained, and put in readiness in their special shires, for the defence of the whole, which accordingly was done, and whereof the Lord <hi>Robert Dudley</hi> Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> was appointed Leeutenant; twenty thousand whereof were disposed along our South Coast for the guard thereof: besides which, she had two Armies; one of which consisting of a thousand Horse, and twenty two thousand Foot, was encamped at <hi>Tilbury</hi> neer the <hi>Thames</hi> mouth, whither the enemy fully intended to come: The other which was led by the Lord <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> consisted of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four thousand Foot, and two thousand Horse, which were to be the Guard of the Queens person: Her self in courage far surmounting her sex, as another <hi>Zenobia</hi> or rather <hi>Deborah,</hi> led forth the Lords Host against this great <hi>Sisera,</hi> and her Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers valiant and skilful, both for courage and quick dispatch, might well be compared to those <hi>Gadites</hi> that came to aid <hi>David,</hi> whose faces were like the faces of Lions, and were compared to the Roes in the Mountains for swiftness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arthur</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Knolles,</hi>

Sir <hi>John Knorris,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Bingham,</hi> and Sir <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> all gallant men, and brave Souldiers, were appointed to consult about managing the Land Service: These advised that all the commodious landing places for the enemy, as well from <hi>Spain,</hi> as from the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> should be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fortified, as <hi>Milford</hi> Haven, <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, Plimmouth, Portland,</hi> the <hi>Isle of Wight, Portsmouth,</hi> the open coast of <hi>Kent,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Downs,</hi> the <hi>Thames</hi> mouth, <hi>Harwich, Yarmouth, Hull, &amp;c.</hi> and that the Trained Bands throughout the Coast Shires, should meet upon a signal given to defend the said places, and do their best to prohibit the enemies landing. But in case he should land, that then they should leave all the Country round about wast, that so they might find nothing for food, but what from their Ships they should carry upon their shoulders, and that they should hold the enemies busied both night and day with continual Alarms, but not to hazard a Battel till more Commanders with their Companies were come together.</p>
                  <p>Some suggested also to the Queen, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> abroad were not so much to be feared as the Papists at home; for that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not attempt the Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>England,</hi> but upon confidence of aid
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95887:17"/>
from them: She thereupon committed some of them to prison at <hi>Wisbeach</hi> in the Fenns; by her Letters also she directed Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams,</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> what he should do.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Scots</hi> she put in mind to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the Papists and <hi>Spanish</hi> Factions: By her frequent Letters she wrote to the States of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in assisting her what they could.</p>
                  <p>But amongst these preparations for War on both sides, <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to cast a mist over her Majesties eyes, and to rock her into a sleep of security, importuned by all means the Realms unto peace, imploying the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> to be his instrument therein, who dealt earnestly by Letters with the help of Sir <hi>James Crofts,</hi> a privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor, and a man much addicted to peace, as also by <hi>Andrew Van Loey,</hi> a <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that a treaty of Peace might be entred upon, affirming that he had Warrant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto from the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Our Queen measuring other Princes by her own guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less heart, gave ear to this deceitful lullaby, little suspecting that a deadly snake could be hid in so fair a Garden; yet resolved to treat of Peace with her Sword in her hand, neither was the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> against her so doing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:95887:17"/>In the month therefore of <hi>Feb.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners were sent into <hi>Flandeas, Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Darby, William Brook,</hi> Lord <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Sir <hi>Jamis Crofts, Valentine Dale,</hi> and <hi>John Rogers</hi> Doctors of the Law, who arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there, were received in the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s name with all courtesy; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon sent away <hi>Dale</hi> presently to him to know where the place of meeting should be, and to see his Commission from the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> the place he appointed to be neer <hi>Ostend,</hi> the Town it self being then in the <hi>English</hi> hands; and as for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, he promised it should be produced at their meeting: Only he wished them to hasten the matter, lest any thing should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the interim to interrupt the treaty: and one <hi>Richardot,</hi> which stood by him, said more openly, <hi>That he knew not what in the mean time might be done against Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Which being reported to the Queen, She sent <hi>Rogers</hi> to the Prince to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was any design for the Invading of <hi>England,</hi> as he, and <hi>Richardot</hi> by their words seemed to imply: The Prince an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that he had never any thought for the Invading <hi>England,</hi> when he wished the Treaty to be hastened, and was angry with <hi>Richardot,</hi> who denied that any such words had fallen from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:95887:18"/>Commissioners for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> were <hi>Maximilian</hi> Earl of <hi>Aremberg,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Antwerp, Richardot</hi> President of <hi>Artois,</hi> with some other Civilians.</p>
                  <p>These stayed at <hi>Bruges,</hi> and for all their pretended haste, much time was cunningly spun out about the place of their meeting, which should have the Precedency, and what hostages should be given for security of the Commissioners: yet at length the <hi>Spaniards</hi> yielded to the <hi>English</hi> Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, both in going and sitting: and the place wars in Tents near unto <hi>Ostend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The demands for the Queen were, that there might be a surcease of Arms, with a present and undelayed Truce, she mistrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Spanish</hi> preparations at Sea: The sending away of forraign Souldiers out of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> for <hi>Englands</hi> security: A restitution of such sums of mony as the Queen had lent to the States, and which the King had promised to restore: That the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> might enjoy their ancient liberties, and priviledges, nor be governed by a stranger, but by a Native Prince: That they might have liberty to serve God with Freedom of Conscience: And lastly, that the Articles of the Pacification of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and other like treaties might be observed; which things if they were granted, she
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95887:18"/>
would condescend upon reasonable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to deliver up the Towns in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> which she then had in possession, that it might appear that she had not for her own advantage, but for the necessary defence of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and her self taken up arms.</p>
                  <p>To these the <hi>Spaniards</hi> replyed, that touching their preparations at Sea, they did assure them that it nothing concerned <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> That to send away the Souldiers, the King could not resolve till the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> had submitted themselves to him. Concerning their priviledges, that it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained nothing to the Queen, neither should She prescribe to the King a Law. And so far was he from tolerating Religion, that he would not so much as hear thereof, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then he had allowed to other Towns that had submitted to his obedience. And as for those Towns which had been taken from the King, and the mony expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about them, They said that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> might demand as many Myriades of Ducats to be repayed to him by the Queen, as he had expended upon the <hi>Low-Country</hi> War, from the time that She supported the revolting <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> and took them into her Protection.</p>
                  <p>About this time went <hi>Dale</hi> by the Queens command to the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95887:19"/>
and mildly expostulated with him about a Book lately published by Cardinal <hi>Allen,</hi> That <hi>English Renegado,</hi> wherein he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Nobility and People of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to joyn with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces, under the conduct of the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> to execute the Popes sentence already pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by his <hi>Bull</hi> against Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; wherein she was declared an Heretick, Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, cruel, for putting to death the Queen of <hi>Scots, &amp;c.</hi> And her subjects ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved from their Oath of Allegiance, and commanded to aid the Prince of <hi>Purma</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Her. (And indeed there was a great number of these <hi>Bulls</hi> and Books printed at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> from thence to be dispersed all over <hi>England.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>The Prince denied that he had ever seen any such Book, or <hi>Bull,</hi> neither would he undertake any thing in the Popes name; howbeit that he must obey his Prince. But for the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> he prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted that he did so honour her for her Vertues, that next to the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he esteemed Her above all others, and would be ready to do Her service. For the manifestation whereof he said that he had perswaded the King to condescend to this treaty of peace, which would be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious for the <hi>English</hi> than for the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95887:19"/>
For</hi> (said he) <hi>if the</hi> Spaniards <hi>be overcome they will soon recover their loss; but if You be overcome, your Kingdom, and all is lost:</hi> To which <hi>Dale</hi> made this reply: <hi>Our Queen is provided with strength sufficient to defend her Kingdom, and you your self in your wisdom may foresee that a Kingdom cannot be lost with the fortune of one Battel; seeing the King of</hi> Spain <hi>after so long Wars, is not able to recover his ancient inheritance in the</hi> Netherlands. Be it so (said the Prince) These things are in the hands of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
                  <p>After this the Commissioners contended with mutual debates, and replies, still twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and untwisting the same thread. For when the <hi>English</hi> pressed that a Toleration of Religion might be granted for the <hi>Vnited Provinces,</hi> at least for two years; It was answered, That as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> demanded not this for the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks; so they hoped the Queen in her wisdom would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire nothing of him which might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Honour, Oath, and Conscience of the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> When they demanded the mony due from the States of <hi>Brabant</hi> to our Queen; They answered, that it was lent without the Kings Knowledge or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and that the accounts being cast up, how much the said mony was, and how
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95887:20"/>
much the King had disbursed about the War, it would soon be known to whom the most ought to be repayed. With such answers as these they dallied with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Commissioners, till the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was come within the view of <hi>England,</hi> and the thundring of the Ordnance was heard from the Sea, which put the <hi>English</hi> Commissioners into some suspicion and fear, having no hostages for their safe return. But they received a safe conduct from the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> (who had in the mean time drawn down all his Forces to the Sea coast) and so were conducted to the borders near <hi>Calice.</hi> Thus came this Treaty to nothing, undertaken by our Queen (as was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) to divert the coming of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet: and continued by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to surprize <hi>England</hi> unprovided, and at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares So both sides put the Foxes skin upon the Lions head.</p>
                  <p>And now we are come to speak of this <hi>Invincible Armado,</hi> which was the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of five whole years at least. It bare it self also upon Divine assistance, having received a special Blessing from the Pope, and was assigned as an <hi>Apostolical Mission</hi> for the reducement of this Kingdom to the obedience of the See of <hi>Rome</hi>: and in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther token of this holy Warfare, there were
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95887:20"/>
amongst the rest of the Ships, <hi>twelve,</hi> called by the names of the <hi>twelve Apostles.</hi> The Gallions and Galliasses were of such a vast size, that they were like floating Towers and Castles, so that the swelling waves of the Sea could hardly be seen; and the Flags, Streamers, and Ensigns so spread in the wind, that they seemed even to darken the Sun, and to threaten destruction which way soever they turned.</p>
                  <p>On the nine and twentieth day of <hi>May</hi> this Fleet set sail out of the <hi>River <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95887:21"/>
slaves, <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> and they freed themselves by the slaughter of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> amongst whom <hi>Don Diego de Mondrana</hi> was one.</p>
                  <p>About the same time the <hi>English</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Vice-Admiral, who had in all about one hundred Ships, whereof fifteen were Victuallers, and nine Voluntaries of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> Gentlemen, hearing for certainty that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was ready to hoise up their sails, resolved to put forth from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and to meet, and fight them by the way; but were so met with by the same wind, that they could not get past the <hi>Syllies,</hi> and thence also were forced by the Tempest to return into their former harbour, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh their Ships, and Companies; only some of their Scouts at Sea descried some of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships, which likewise had been dispersed with the storm: but before the <hi>English</hi> could come near them, the wind vereing about, carryed them back to the <hi>Groine,</hi> where there rest of their Fleet lay in harbour.</p>
                  <p>Intelligence being brought that the <hi>Saa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were in want, their great Ships dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed, and the rest sorely shaken with the storm, and their men dying by multitudes of the Pestilence; the Lord Admiral <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95887:21"/>
intended with the first Northerly wind to take advantage, which coming about upon the eighth of <hi>July,</hi> he lanched forth, and bore his sails almost within the sight of <hi>Spain,</hi> purposing to surprise their weather-beaten Ships, and to fight them upon their own Coast. But then the wind suddenly changing into the South, and he wisely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing that the enemy might pass by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his discovery, that the Seas might be stormy, or his Fleet wind-bound, and that whilst he thus lay abroad, his service might be more necessary at home, and that his work was to defend the Coasts of <hi>England,</hi> he therefore presently returned and ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Fleet in the Haven at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his men to refresh themselves upon the Land.</p>
                  <p>At the same time there came more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident advertisement (though false) not only to the Lord Admiral, but to the Court, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet could not possibly come forth again that year, upon which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports (a dangerous matter in State affairs) so confident was our Queen, that she sent for four of her biggest royal Ships to be brought back to <hi>Chattam</hi>: But the Lord Admiral suspecting the worst, by a mild and moderate answer retarded it, desiring that nothing might be lightly believed in so
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95887:22"/>
weighty a matter, and that he might retain them though at his own charge. Wherein indeed a special providence of God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, for just at that time news was brought to the Lord Admiral by one Captain <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Flemming,</hi> that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was entred into the <hi>British</hi> Seas, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Channel,</hi> and was seen near unto the <hi>Lizard point,</hi> which came thus to pass.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> ships being new rigged, and their wants supplyed, their King still hot on his former resolutions, instantly urged and hastened his Commanders to put forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to Sea, which accordingly they did upon the eleventh of <hi>July</hi> with the same South wind which (as was said before) brought back our Navy into <hi>Plimouth</hi>; and so having a more favourable Gale, with brave shews, and full Sails, they entred our Channel, where casting Anchor, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched certain smal Pinnaces to the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> to signifie their arrival and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness, and to command him in the name of their King to forward his charge for that service.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twentieth about noon, this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Fleet was descried by the <hi>English,</hi> coming forward amain with a South-west wind. It was a kind of surprise: For that (as was said) many of our men were gone
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95887:22"/>
to land, and our ships ready to depart: Nevertheless our undaunted Admiral tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth such ships as he could get in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness into the deep Sea, not without great difficulty, certainly with singular diligence, and admirable alacrity of our Mariners, cheered up with the Admirals own presence and assistance among them at their halser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, the wind blowing strongly into the Haven.</p>
                  <p>When they were forth they saw the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> ships with lofty Towers like Castles, in front like an half-moon, the horns where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of stretched forth in breadth about seven miles, sayling (as it were) with labour to the winds, the Ocean groaning under them; so that though with full sails, yet they came but slowly forward. They seemed as it were to make for <hi>Plymouth</hi>; but whether their Commission was otherwise, or because contrary to their expectation, they saw the <hi>English</hi> ships out of the Harbour, they stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by towards <hi>Calice,</hi> hoping to meet with the Prince of <hi>Parma:</hi> The <hi>English</hi> willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffered them to pass by, that they might the more commodiously chase them in the Reer with a fore-right wind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iuly</hi> the twenty first, the Lord Admiral of <hi>England</hi> sent before him a Pinnace called the <hi>Defiance,</hi> to denounce war by dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95887:23"/>
her Ordnance, himself following in the <hi>Ark-Royal,</hi> set upon the Admiral (as he thought) of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> but it proved to be <hi>Alonzo de Leva</hi>'s ship, where fire, smoke, and loud thundring Cannons began the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley; and rending Bullets most freely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanged betwixt them, were fiery mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers of each others minds. Soon after came up <hi>Drake, Hawkins</hi> and <hi>Forbusher,</hi> playing with their Ordnance upon the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Squadron of the Enemies, which was commanded by <hi>Rechalde,</hi> who laboured all he could to stay his Men from flying for shelter to the Fleet, till his own ship being much battered with shot, and now grown unserviceable, was with much difficulty drawn into the main Fleet. At which time the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> gathered together his whole Fleet, scattered here and there by the <hi>English,</hi> and hoising more sail, kept on his intended course toward <hi>Callice</hi>; neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could he do otherwise, the wind fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the <hi>English,</hi> and himself finding the inconvenience of their great and high built ships, powerful to defend, but not to offend; to stand, but not to move; whereas on the contrary their enemies were nimble, and ready on all sides to annoy them, and as apt to escape harms themselves, being low built and so easily shot over. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95887:23"/>
he caused them to gather themselves up close in the form of an half-moon, and to slacken their sails that their whole Fleet might keep together. But our <hi>English</hi> Admiral having maintained an hot fight for the space of two hours, thought nor good to continue it any longer, thirty of his ships scarce coming to the work, the rest being as yet scarce gotten out of the Harbour.</p>
                  <p>In this first days fight the Saint <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> a <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship, having been sorely bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and much torn, was taken into the middest of their Fleet to be repaired: And an huge Ship of <hi>Biscaie</hi> of Don <hi>Oquendoes,</hi> in which was a great part of the Kings trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, began to be all in a Flame by force of Gunpowder, which was fired on purpose by a <hi>Flemish</hi> Gunner, for being misused by them: But the fire was soon quenched by the assistance of some other ships sent in to her help. All this while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for want of courage (which they called <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>) did what they could to decline the fight, casting themselves continually into Roundels (their strongest ships walling in the rest) in which posture they made a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing march towards <hi>Callis</hi>: yet in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer medly a great Gallion, wherein was Don <hi>Pedro de Valdez, Vasques de Silva, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenzo de Saias,</hi> with other Noble men,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95887:24"/>
being sore battered with the <hi>English</hi> shot, in avoyding whereof she fell foul upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ship, and ere she could be cleared had her fore-mast broken off, which so hundred her sailing, that she was unable to keep way with the rest of the Fleet, nor were their friends of courage to succour these distressed Lords, but left both ship and them in this sudden and unexpected danger. But the night coming on, our Lord Admiral supposing that they had left neither men nor Mariners aboard within her, and fearing to lose sight of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> past by her, and followed the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn which he supposed to be carried by Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> as it was appointed, but that brave Knight was eagerly pursuing five great Hulks which he took to be of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but when he came up, and haled them, they proved <hi>Easterlings</hi> and friends, and so were dismissed: yet by this mistake of his, the greatest part of our Fleet, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the direction of his light, was forced to lye still: so that he and the rest of the Fleet till towards night, the next day, could not recover sight of the Lord Admiral, who all the night before with two other ships, the <hi>Bear</hi> and the <hi>Mary-Rose</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Spanish</hi> Lanthorn.</p>

                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty second; Sir <hi>Francis
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95887:24"/>
Drake</hi> espied the aforementioned lagging Gallion, whereupon he sent forth a Pinnace to command them to yield, otherwise his bullets without any delay should force them to it: <hi>Valdes,</hi> to seem valorous, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that they were four hundred and fifty strong; that himself was Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> and stood on his honour, and thereupon propounded certain conditions: But the Knight returned this reply, that he had no leisure to parley, if he would immediately yield, so; otherwise be should soon prove that <hi>Drake</hi> was no dastard. <hi>Pedro</hi> hearing that it was the fiery <hi>Drake</hi> (whose name was very terrible to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) that had him in chase, presently yielded, and with forty of his companions, came on board Sir <hi>Francis</hi> his Ship, where first giving him the <hi>Conge,</hi> he protested that he and all his were resolved to have dyed fighting, had they not fallen into his hands, whose valour and felicity was so great, that <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> seemed to wait on him in all his attempts, and whose noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mind towards the vanquished, had often been experienced even of his greatest foes. Sir <hi>Francis</hi> to requite his <hi>Spanish</hi> Complements with <hi>English</hi> Courtesie, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him at his own table, and lodged him in his own Cabin: the residue of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95887:25"/>
he sent to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained prisoners for the space of eighteen months, till by payment of their ransoms they obtained their liberty: But <hi>Drakes</hi> Souldiers had well paid themselves by the plunder of the ship, wherein they found 55000 Ducats of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The same day <hi>Michael de Oquendo,</hi> Admiral of the Squadron <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pusco,</hi> and Vice-Admiral of the whole Fleet, suffered no less a disaster; whose ship being one of the greatest Gallions, fell on fire, and all the upper part of the ship being burnt, most also of the persons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were consumed: howbeit the Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the hold not taking fire, the ship fell into the hands of the <hi>English,</hi> which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the scorched <hi>Spaniards</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, was brought into <hi>Plimouth,</hi> a joyful spectacle to the beholders. All this day, the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> laboured securely to set his Fleet in order; To <hi>Alphonso de Leva</hi> he gave in charge to joyne the first and last squadron together; To every ship he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed his quarter to ride in according to the form prescribed in <hi>Spain,</hi> commanding them upon pain of death not to desert their stations. <hi>Glitch,</hi> an Ensign-bearer, he sent to the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> to acquaint him with his condition.</p>

                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty third, early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> taking the benefit of a Northerly wind, when they approached right against <hi>Portland,</hi> turned about against the <hi>English</hi>; but the <hi>English,</hi> nimble, and foreseeing all advantages, soon turned aside to the VVestward, each striving to get the wind of the other, which at last the <hi>English</hi> got, and so they prepared themselves on each side to fight; and the <hi>English</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued all day from morning till night to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter those wooden Castles with great and small shot: The fight was very confused and variable, whilst on the one side the <hi>English</hi> bravely rescued the <hi>London</hi> ships that were hemmed in by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and on the other side the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as stoutly delivered <hi>Rechalde</hi> being in danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Never was there heard greater thundring of Ordnance on both sides, the chiefest fight being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on this day; yet notwithstanding the shot from the <hi>Spanish</hi> ships for the most part flew over the <hi>English</hi> without hurting them, only <hi>Cock</hi> an <hi>Englishman</hi> dyed with honour in the midst of his enemies in a little ship of his. The <hi>English</hi> ships being far the lesser, charged that <hi>Sea-Gyant</hi> with marvellous agility, and having given them their broad sides flew off again presently, and then coming up, levelled their shot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95887:26"/>
without missing those heavy an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildy ships of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But the Lord Admiral would not hazzard a fight by grappling with them, as some unadvised persons would have perswaded him: For he considered that the enemy had a strong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the Fleet, whereas he had none; that their ships were more in number, of bigger burden, stronger, and huger built, so that they could not be boarded but with extreme disadvantage: He foresaw also that the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw would turn to a greater dammage than the victory would avail him: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanquished he should have brought <hi>England</hi> into extreme hazzard, and being conqueror he should only have gained a little glory to himself for overthrowing the Fleet, and beating the enemy. On this day the sorest fight was performed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, besides other remarkable harms which the enemy sustained, a great <hi>Venetian</hi> ship with some other smaller were surprized, and taken by the <hi>English,</hi> and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> were forced for their further safety to gather themselves close into a Roundel, their best and greatest ships standing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that they might secure those that were battered and less.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty fourth, the fight was only between the four great Galliasses,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95887:26"/>
and some of the <hi>English</hi> ships, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> having great advantage, theirs being rowed with oars, and ours (by reason of the calm) having no use of their sails, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding which they sorely galled the enemy with their great and chain shot; wherewith they cut in sunder their tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, cables, and cordage to their no little prejudice. But wanting powder which they had spent so freely, and other provision to maintain the fight, the Lord Admiral sent some of his smaller ships to the next Ports of <hi>England</hi> to fetch supply; which stirred up jealousies in the heads of many, that we should thus want upon our own Coasts. In which <hi>Interim</hi> a Council was called, wherein it was resolved that the <hi>English</hi> Fleet should be divided into four squadrons, and those committed to four brave Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and skilful Seamen, whereof the Lord Admiral in the <hi>Ark-Royal</hi> was chief: Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> in the <hi>Revenge</hi> led the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: Captain <hi>Hawkins</hi> the third: and Captain <hi>Forbusher</hi> the fourth. Other most valiant Captains there were in others of Her Majesties Ships, as the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> in the <hi>Lion,</hi> the Lord <hi>Sheffield</hi> in the <hi>Bear,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Southwel</hi> in the <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> Captain <hi>Baker</hi> in the <hi>Victory,</hi> and Captain <hi>George Fenner</hi> in the <hi>Gallion-Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester:</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:95887:27"/>
It was also further appoined that out of every squadron certain small vessels should give you a charge from diverse parts in the dead time of the night, but the calm continuing, this designe could not be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty fifth, being Saint <hi>James</hi> day, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were arrived against the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where was a most terrible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, each shooting off their whole broad sides, and not above sixscore yards the one from the other: There the Saint <hi>Anne,</hi> a Gallion of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which could not hold course with the rest, was set upon by certain small <hi>English</hi> Vessels, to whose rescue came <hi>Leva</hi> and <hi>Don Diego Telles Enriques</hi> with three Galliasses: which the Lord Admiral himself and the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> in the <hi>Golden Lion,</hi> row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ships with their boats (so great was the calm) charged in such sort with their roaring Canons, that they had much ado, and that not without loss, to save the Gallion, from which time forward none of the Galliasses would undertake the fight. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> reported that the <hi>English</hi> the same day beat the <hi>Spanish</hi> Admiral in the utter squadron, rending her sore with their Great Ordnance, and having slain many of her men, shot down her main Mast, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95887:27"/>

                     </hi> and <hi>Rechalde</hi> came in good time to her rescue. That the <hi>Spanish</hi> Admiral, assisted by <hi>Rechalde</hi> and others, set upon the <hi>English</hi> Admiral, which happily escaped by the sudden turning of the wind. That thereupon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gave over the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, and holding on their Course, dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again a Messenger to the Prince of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> to joyn his Fleet with all speed to the Kings <hi>Armado,</hi> and withal to send them a supply of great shot. But these things were unknown to the <hi>English,</hi> who wrote that from one of the <hi>Spanish</hi> ships they had shot down their Lanthorn, and from another the Beak-head, and that they had done much hurt to the third; that the <hi>Non-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella</hi> and the <hi>Mary Rose,</hi> had fought a while with the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; and that other ships had rescued the <hi>Tryumph,</hi> which was in danger: The truth is, they had so sorely battered those huge wooden Castles, that once more they forced them for their further safety to gather themselves into a Roundel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty sixth, the Lord Admiral, to encourage and reward the Noble At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of his gallant Captains, bestowed the Order of Knighthood upon the Lords <hi>Howard</hi> and <hi>Sheffield, Roger Townsend, John Hawkings, Martin Forbusher,</hi> and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95887:28"/>
others: And yet the vain glorious and boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting <hi>Spaniards</hi> caused a report to be spread in <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> was wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by them. It was resolved by our men that from thenceforth they should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail the enemy no more till they came to the <hi>British Frith,</hi> or strait of <hi>Callis,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Henry Seimore</hi> and Sir <hi>William Winter,</hi> with the ships which they had for the guard of the narrow Seas, waited their coming; and so with a fair gale from the South West and by South, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet sailed forward, the <hi>English</hi> Fleet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it close at the heels. And so far was it from terrifying our <hi>English</hi> Coasts with the name of <hi>Invincible,</hi> or with its huge and terrible spectacle, that our brave <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> youth with an incredible alacrity, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parents, wives, children, kinsfolk, and friends out of their entire love to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, hired ships from all parts at their own proper charges, and joyned with the Fleet in great numbers, amongst whom were the Earls of <hi>Oxford, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland: Thomas</hi> and <hi>Robert Cecil: Henry Brook: Charles Blunt: Walter Raleigh: William Hatton: Robert Carey: Ambrose Willoughby: Thomas Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard: Arthur Gorges,</hi> and many others of great note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:95887:28"/>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty seventh, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet making forward, towards evening, came over against <hi>Dover,</hi> and anchored before <hi>Callis,</hi> intending for <hi>Dunkerk</hi> there to joyn with the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s forces, well perceiving that without their assistance they could do nothing: They were also warned by the Pilots, that if they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any farther it was to be feared lest they should be driven by the force of the tide into the Northern Ocean. The <hi>English</hi> Fleet following up hard upon them, cast Anchor so neer that they lay within Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering shot; at which time the Lord <hi>Henry Seimore,</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> joyned their ships to them, so that now the <hi>English</hi> Fleet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of one hundred and forty sail, all able ships to fight, sail, and turn about which way soever they pleased. Yet were they not above fifteen that sustained the greatest burden of the fight. From hence once more the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> sent to the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> to hasten forth his long expected, and much desired forces: with which mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers many of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Noble men went to land, having had enough of the Sea; amongst whom was the Prince of <hi>Ascoli,</hi> the Kings base son, who returned to his ship no more; and indeed well it was for him, for that his Gallion was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95887:29"/>
cast away upon the <hi>Irish</hi> Coast, and never returned to salute <hi>Spain.</hi> These messengers earnestly prayed the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> to put forth to Sea with his Army, which the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet should protect, as it were under her wings, till it was landed in <hi>England.</hi> And indeed the Prince of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> hearing the best, and not the worst of this voyage, made all things ready that lay in his charge, whose hopes were so fixed upon <hi>Englands</hi> Conquest, and the glittering Diadem upon Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> head did so dazel his ambitious eyes, being assured by Cardinal <hi>Allen</hi> that he was the man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be crowned therewith, that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Coronet of the <hi>Low-Country</hi> Government, he transferred the charge thereof upon Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> the Elder, and having made his vows to the Lady of <hi>Hall</hi> in <hi>Heinault,</hi> he was already in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit no less than a King. But the date of his reign was soon expired, and his swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tide fallen into a low shallow ebb: For the day following in his march to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> he heard the thundring Ordnance ringing the passing peal of his hopes and title, and the same evening had news of the hard suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the hoped advancers of his dreamed felicity; and indeed do what he could, he could not be ready at the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95887:29"/>
                     <hi>Spaniards</hi> call: His flat-bottomed boats for the shallow Channels leaked; his provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of victuals proved unready, and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners (having hitherto been detained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their wills) had withdarwn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: there lay also watching before the Havens of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> whence he was to put forth to Sea, the men of War of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zelanders,</hi> so well provided with great Ordnance and Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, that he could not put from the shore unless he would wilfully cast himself and his men upon eminent perils and dangers of destruction: and yet he being a skilful and experienced Commander, omitted no means, being inflamed with a desire to conquer <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> foresight pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented both his diligence and the credulous hope of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For by Her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the next day after the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had cast Anchor, the Lord Admiral made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy eight of his worst ships, filled with wild-fire, pitch, rosin, brimstone, and other combustible matter: their Ordnance were charged with bullets, stones, chains, and such like things, fit instruments of death; and all the men being taken out, upon the Sabbath day, <hi>July</hi> the twenty eighth, at two of the clock after midnight, were they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95887:30"/>
let drive with wind and tide, under the guidance of <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>Prowse,</hi> amongst the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet. And so the Pilots re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, and their trains taking fire, such a sudden thunderclap was given by them, that the affrighted <hi>Spaniards,</hi> it being the dead time of the night, were amazed, and stricken with an horrible fear, lest all their ships should have been fired by them. And to avoid this present mischief, being in great perplexity, they had no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to avoid these deadly engines, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering inventions, then by cutting their cables in sunder, the time being too short to weigh up their Anchors, and so hoising up their sails to drive at random into the Seas: in which hast and confusion the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of their Galliastes fell foul upon another ship, and lost her rudder: and so floted up and down, and the next day fearfully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king towards <hi>Callis,</hi> ran aground upon the sands, where she was set upon by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi> This Galliass was of <hi>Naples</hi>: Her General was <hi>Hough de Moncado,</hi> who fought the more valiantly, because he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected present help from the Prince of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma:</hi> But Sir <hi>Amias Preston</hi> gave such a fierce assault upon her, that <hi>Moncado</hi> was shot dead with a bullet, and the Galliass boarded, wherein many of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:95887:30"/>
were slain, and a great many others leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Sea were drowned, only Don <hi>Antonio de Matiques,</hi> a principal Officer, had the good hap to escape, and was the first man that carried the unwelcome news into <hi>Spain,</hi> that their <hi>Invincible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> proved vincible. This huge bottom manned with four hundred Souldiers, and three hundred slaves, that had in her fifty thousand Ducats of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Kings trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, fell into the <hi>English</hi> mens hands; a reward well befitting their valour, who sharing it merrily amongst them, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miserable slaves from their fetters, would have fired the empty vessel: but Monsieur <hi>Gourden,</hi> Governour of <hi>Callis,</hi> fearing that the fire might endanger the Town, would not permit them to do it, bending his Ordnance against those which attempted it.</p>
                  <p>Had not this politick Stratagem of the fire-ships been found out, it would have been very difficult for the <hi>English</hi> to have dislodged them; for those huge ships had their bulks so strengthened with thick planks, and massie beams, that our bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets might strike, and stick, and yet never pass through them: So that the greatest hurt which our <hi>English</hi> Canon did, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by rending their Masts and tacklings.</p>

But contrary to expectation, the enemies with their sails spread, betook themselves to an absolute flight, and leaving <hi>Scotland</hi> on the West, they bended their Course towards <hi>Norway,</hi> being ill advised therein, (but their necessity urged, and God had infatuated their Counsels) thus to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to put their shaken and battered bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms into those black and dangerous Seas: Neither was the Climate heathful for the crazed Bodies of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> over-beaten, and tired with wants, they being now entred the fifty seventh degree of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Latitude; from whence our Lord
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95887:34"/>
Admiral returned, leaving only some Scouts to discover their success.</p>
                  <p>When the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> came to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entertained him with opprobrious speeches, as if in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his opportunity, and willingly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown so hopeful a Design. The Prince to give them some satisfaction punished his Purveyors of Victuals, yet withal laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his sleeve at the insolency of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> having heard them formerly to make their boasts that whithersoever they went they carried assured victory along with them, and that the <hi>English</hi> durst nor once abide to look them in the face.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> (as was said even now) being freed from the <hi>English</hi> that had haunted them like their Ghosts, consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted most seriously what was next to be done: they were very tender of the Popes Credit, who had prophesied, that this attempt would be fortunate and successful: The wrath of King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> was to be feared, his vast Expences being thus lost, and his hopes frustrated: other Adventurers would be undone: the glory of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would be laid in the dust: the <hi>Invincible Navy</hi> become a scorn, and <hi>England</hi> would still be <hi>England,</hi> not lorded over by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:95887:34"/>
if without further attempt they should return into <hi>Spain.</hi> But on the other hand they considered that 5 thousand of the Souldiers were slain: a multitude of their Survivors lay sick or maimed upon their hands: Twelve of their greatest ships were sunk, lost, or taken: their Cables, Masts, and Sails were cut; rent and broken with the <hi>English</hi> shot: Their Anchors left in the road of <hi>Callis</hi>: their victuals fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: Their fresh water was spent: and their enemies no less fierce, undaunted, and successful than at the first: The Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> though long in preparing, yet still unready, and kept in by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> firm Allies: which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances wisely ballanced, the vote went currant for their hastning to <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But withal knowing that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> (fast knit in affection and blood to our Queen) would yield them no sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; and having as little hope that <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> would afford them any, they cast all their, Horses, and Mules overboard, for the sparing of their fresh water: and so framing their course to sail about <hi>Cathenes,</hi> and the Coasts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> they steered between the <hi>Orcades</hi> and the Isles of <hi>Farr</hi> unto the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty first degree of Latitude: From whence the Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi> with his best stored
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95887:35"/>
ships, took Westward over the main Ocean towards <hi>Biscay,</hi> and at last arrived safely in <hi>Spain:</hi> where for his welcome, he was deposed from all his authority, forbidden to come at Court, and commanded to live private, neither could he give satisfaction by his bad excuses, albeit he imputed it to the treachery of his Mariners; to their ignorance; and small experience of those Northern Seas. The want of succours from the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>; the Tempests, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks and ill fortune: but not a word of the judgement of God, upon that Giant-like undertaking to enslave all <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Spanish</hi> yoke.</p>
                  <p>The residue of the Ships, being about forty in number, fell nearer with the coast of <hi>Ireland,</hi> intending to touch at Cape <hi>Clare,</hi> well hoping there to refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and supply their wants: but the winds proving contrary and tempestuous upon those dangerous Seas, many of their ships perished upon the <hi>Irish</hi> shores, and amongst others a great Galliass, wherein <hi>Michael de Oquendo</hi> was Commander, and two other <hi>Venetian</hi> ships of great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, besides thirty eight more, with most of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> contained in them Such as got clear off the danger, put forth to Sea: some of which by a strong West Wind
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95887:35"/>
were driven into the <hi>English</hi> Channel, where some of them were again set upon and taken by the <hi>English,</hi> others by men of <hi>Rochel</hi> in <hi>France</hi>; and some arrived at <hi>New Haven</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi>: So that of one hundred thirty four ships that set fail out of <hi>Lisboa,</hi> only fifty three returned into <hi>Spain</hi>: Of the four Galliasses of <hi>Naples</hi> but one: of the four Oallions of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but one: of the ninety one <hi>Callions,</hi> and great Hulks from divers Provinces, only thirty three returned, fifty eight being lost. In brief, they lost in this voyage eighty one vessels, thirteen thousand, five hundred and odd Souldiers. Prisoners taken in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> were above two thousand: Amongst those in <hi>England,</hi> Don <hi>Pedro de Valdez,</hi> Don <hi>Vasques de Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> and Don <hi>Alonzo de Saies,</hi> and others were kept for their ransome. In <hi>Ireland</hi> Don <hi>Alonzo de Luzon, Roderigo de Lasse,</hi> and others of great account: In <hi>Zeland</hi> was Don <hi>Diego Piementelli</hi>: To be brief, there was no famous, or noble family in all <hi>Spain,</hi> which in this expedition lost not a son, brother, or kinsman. And thus this <hi>Armado</hi> which had been so many years in preparing, and rigging with such vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, was in one month many times as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95887:36"/>
and at length wholly defeated with the slaughter of so many of her men, not one hundred of the <hi>English</hi> being lacking, nor one small ship of theirs taken, or lost, save only that of <hi>Cocks</hi>: and having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed round about all <hi>Britain,</hi> by <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Orcades</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously tossed, and very much distressed, and wasted by stormes, wracks, and all kinds of misery, at length came lamely home, with perpetual dishonour: whereupon <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> were stamped in memory thereof: A Fleet flying with full sailes; with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, <hi>Venit, vidit, fugit,</hi> It came, it saw, it fled: Others in honour of our Queen, with flaming ships, and a Fleet in a great confusion, and this Motto, <hi>Dux fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina facti,</hi> A woman was conductor of the fact.</p>
                  <p>In the aforementioned wracks above se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred Souldiers and Sailors were cast on land in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who (upon the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and by the permission of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) were after a years time sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>: But more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully were those miserable wretches dealt withal, whose hap was to be driven by tempest into <hi>Ireland</hi>: Some of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95887:36"/>
slain by the wild <hi>Irish</hi> (their old friends) and others of them being put to death by the command of the Lord Deputy: For he fearing lest they might joyn with the <hi>Irish</hi> to disturb the peace of the Nation, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Bingham,</hi> Governour of <hi>Connaught</hi> to destroy them: but he, refusing to deal so rigorously with those that had yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, He sent <hi>Fowle,</hi> Deputy-Marshall, who drew them out of their lurking holes, and cut off the heads of above two hundred of them; which fact the Queen from her heart condemned, and abhorred as a fact of too great cruelty. The remainder of them being terrified herewith, sick and starven as they were, committed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Sea in their shattered vessels, and were many of them swallowed up by the waves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> charged the whole fault of their overthrow upon the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> as if in favour to our Queen he had wilfully and artificially delayed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them: But this was but an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and pretention given out by them, partly upon a <hi>Spanish</hi> envy against that Prince, he being an <hi>Italian,</hi> and his Son a Competitor to the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi>: But chiefly to save the scorn and monstous
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95887:37"/>
disreputation which they and their Nation received by the success of that enterprise: Therefore their colours, and excuses (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) were, That their General by Sea had a limited Commission, not to fight till the Land Forces were come in to them, and that the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> had particular reaches and ends of his own to cross the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.</p>
                  <p>But it was both a strange Commission, and a strange Obedience to a Commission, for men in the midst of their own blood, and being so furiously assailed, to hold their hands, contrary to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and necessity. And as for the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> he was reasonably well tempted to be true to that enterprise, by no less promise than to be made a Feudatory or Beneficiary King of <hi>England</hi> under the Seignory (in chief) of the Pope, and the protection of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Besides, it appeared that the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> held his place long after of the Govenment of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> in the favour and trust of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and by the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and services that he performed in <hi>France.</hi> It is also manifest that this Prince did his best to come down, and put to Sea: The truth was, that the <hi>Spanish</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:95887:37"/>
Navy, upon those proofs of Fight which they had with the <hi>English,</hi> finding how much hurt they received, and how little, hurt they did, by reason of the activity and low building of our ships, and skill of Sea-men; and being also commanded by a General of small courage and experience, and having lost at first two of their bravest Commanders at Sea, <hi>Pedro de Valdez,</hi> and <hi>Michael de Oquenda,</hi> durst not put it to a Battel at Sea, but set up their rest whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Land enterprise. On the other side, the transportation of the Land Forces failed in the very foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For, whereas the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> made full account that their Navy should be Master of the Sea, and therefore able to guard and protect the Vessels of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation: When it fell out to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that the great Navy was distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and had enough to do to save it self, and that their Land Forces were impounded by the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Things (I say) being in this state, it came to pass that the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> must have flown, if he would have come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> for he could get neither Bark, nor Mariner to put to Sea. Yet certain it is that the Prince looked for the comming
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95887:38"/>
back of the <hi>Armado</hi> even at that time when they were wandring, and making their perambulation upon the Northern Seas.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the curse of God and his threatning in Scripture accomplished: <hi>They came out against us one way, and they fled seven wayes before us</hi>: making good (even to the astonishment of all Posterity) the wonderful Judgments of God poured out commonly upon such vast and proud aspirings.</p>
                  <p>After this Glorious Deliverance of our Land by the Power of the <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,</hi> and the wild Boar repelled that sought to lay waste <hi>Englands</hi> fair and fruitful Vineyard, our Gracious and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Queen (who ever held Ingratitude a Capital sin, especially towards her <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Protector</hi>) as she had begun with Prayer, so she ended with Praise, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding solemn <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated to the Lord of Hosts at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in her chief City of <hi>London,</hi> which accordingly was done upon Sabbath day the eighth of <hi>September</hi>: at which time eleven of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ensignes (the once badges of their bravery, but now of their vanity and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy)
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95887:38"/>
were hung upon the lower battlements of that Church, as Palmes of Praise for <hi>Englands</hi> Deliverance: a shew no doubt more pleasing to God than when their spread colours did set out the pride of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> threatning the blood of so many innocent and faithful Christians.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her self, to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample unto others upon Sabbath the twenty fourth of <hi>September,</hi> came from her Palace of <hi>White-Hall</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> through the streets of <hi>London</hi> (which were hung with blew Cloth, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the City standing in their Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on both sides with their Banners in goodly order) being carried in a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot drawn with two Horses to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, where dismounting from her. Chariot at the West door, she humbled her self upon her knees and with great devotion, in an audible voice She praised God as her only <hi>Defender,</hi> who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Her self and People from the bloody designes of so cruel an enemy. The Sermon then preached tended wholly wholly to give all the glory to God, as the Author of this wonderful deliverance: and when that was ended, Her Majesty
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95887:39"/>
Herself, with most Princely and Christian speeches exhorted all the people to a due performance of those religious services of thankfulness which the Lord expected and required of them.</p>
                  <p>About the same time the Fair being kept in <hi>Southwark,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Flags were hung up at <hi>London Bridge</hi> to the great joy of the beholders, and eternal infamy of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> proud attempts, as irreligious as unsuccessful. But the solemn day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Thanksgiving throughout the Land was the nineteenth of <hi>November</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tuesday, which accordingly was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served with great joy and praising of God; and well it were if it had so continued still, being no less a Deliverance than was that of <hi>Purim</hi> amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to be kept holy throughout their Generations.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Zelanders</hi> also to leave a memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of their thnakfulness to God, and their faithfulness to our Queen, caused <hi>Medals</hi> of Silver to be stamped, having engraven on the one side the Armes of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; with this inscription, <hi>Glory to God alone,</hi> and on the reverse, the pourtracture of great Ships, under written, <hi>the Spanish Fleet,</hi> and in the circumference, <hi>It came,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95887:39"/>
It went, It was, Anno</hi> 1588. In other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals also were stamped ships floating, and sinking, and in the reverse, Supplicants upon their knees, with this Motto, <hi>man proposeth, God disposeth,</hi> 1588. The <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> also stamped some medals with <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> ships and this Motto, <hi>Impius fugit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine sequente:</hi> the wicked fly when none pursues.</p>
                  <p>Our Queen, to shew her gratitude as well to the instruments as to the Author of this great Deliverance, assigned cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain yearly Rents to the Lord Admiral for his gallant service, and many times commended him, and the other Captains of Her Ships, as men born for the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Country. The rest she gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously saluted by name as oft as she saw them, as men of notable deserts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they held themselves well apaid, and those which were wounded, maimed, or poor, She rewarded with competent pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                  <p>The Lord of Hosts having thus dispel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this storm, the Queen dissolved her Camp at <hi>Tilbury,</hi> and not long after the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> ended his dayes, having been a Peer of great estate and honour, but liable to the common destiny of <hi>Great
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95887:40"/>
ones,</hi> whom all men magnifie in their life time, but few speak well of after their death.</p>
                  <p>THis Admirable Deliverance was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated by almost all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, especially by all the reformed Churches, and many Learned Men ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the same in Verse, amongst which I shall onely mention two: The first was that Poem made by Reverend Mr. <hi>Beza</hi>; Translated into all the chief Languages in Christendom, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated to all ensuing Posterity. It was this.</p>

                  <p>LEast the Remembrance of so signal a Mercy, and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance vouchsafed by God both to our Church and State should be buried in Oblivion, I have (at the request of the Book-seller) presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee here with a true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Narrative of that Grand Work of Darkness forged in Hell, and by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> suggested to some Popish Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:95887:45"/>
who envying the peace and prosperity of our Church, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the Gospel, had designed at one blow to overthrow both: And that nothing might be wanting to compleat that horrid wickedness, their purpose was to have charged it upon the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, thereby hoping to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their Religion from the imputation of so hainous a crime.</p>
                  <p>Now that the memorial of a Mercy of such publick and general concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should not be forgotten, we have the Word of the Eternal God to be our Guide therein, when the Lord had by his Angel destroyed the first born of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and spared <hi>Israel,</hi> He instituted the Feast of the Passover to continue the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial thereof through their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Exod. 12.11, 12, 14, 26, 27.</hi> saith <hi>Moses</hi> to them, when your Children shall say unto you, <hi>What mean you by this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>? Ye shall say, It is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb facs="tcp:95887:45"/>
of the Lords Passover, who passed over the houses the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> when He smote the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> and delivered our houses. And how careful good <hi>Mordecai</hi> was to continue the remembrance of that great Deliverance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God from Destruction plotted, and contrived by that wicked <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> appears <hi>Esther 9.20. &amp;c.</hi> where they did not only celebrate those present dayes of their Deliverance with Feasting and Gladness: but he, together with the rest of the <hi>Jewes</hi> ordained, and took upon them, and their Seed, and upon all such as joyned themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep those days in their appointed time every year, and that those days should be remembred, and kept through their Generations, every Family, every Province, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City, and that those days of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim should not fail from amongst the
<pb facs="tcp:95887:46"/>
                     <hi>Jews,</hi> nor the memorial of them perish from their Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And truly the remembrance of this great Mercy hath the more need to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived at this time, when some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted persons amongst us begin to les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, and decry it, and wholly to lay aside the observation of that day, though enjoyned by Act of Parliament, and made Conscience of by most of the Godly People of the Nation. I have also been induced the rather to make this brief Collection of the Story, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, though it be published by others; yet it is in larger Volumes, which are not every ones mony; whereas for a small matter every family may get and keep this by them for the benefit, and satisfaction both of themselves and children, that so the Lord may not lose of his Glory, nor they (for want of information) fail of their duty. I shall conclude with that of the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, Psal. 107.8. O that men would praise the Lord for his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:

                  <p>THe Plot was to undermine the Parliament House, and with Powder to blow up the King, Prince, Clergy, Nobles, Knights, and Burgesses, the very confluence of all the flower of Glory, Piety, Learning, Prudence and Authority in the Land: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Sons, Brothers, Allies, Friends, Foes, Papists and Protestants, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95887:48"/>
business, till at last <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> came puffing in to <hi>Catesby</hi>'s Lodging at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> saying, <hi>What Gentlemen, shall we alwaies be talking, and never do any thing? You cannot be ignorant how things proceed</hi>? To whom <hi>Catesby</hi> answered, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was resolved on, but first an Oath for secresie was to be administred: for which purpose they appointed to meet some three days after, behind Saint <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> Church beyond <hi>Temple</hi>-Bar; where being met, <hi>Percy</hi> professed that for the Catholick cause himself would be the man to advance it, were it with the slaughter of the King, which he was there ready to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake and and do.</p>
                  <p>No <hi>Tom</hi> (said <hi>Catesby</hi>) thou shalt not adventure thy self to so small purpose; if thou wilt be a Traytor, there is a Plot to greater advantage, and such an one as can never be discovered: Hereupon all of them took the Oath of Secresie, heard a Mass, and received the Sacrament, after which <hi>Catesby</hi> told them his Devillish De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise by mine and Gunpowder to blow up the Parliament House, and so by one stroke with the destruction of many to effect that at once which had been many years at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting: And for case of conscience to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95887:49"/>
kill the innocent with the nocent, he told them that it was warrantable by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Garnet</hi> himself, the superiour of the <hi>English</hi> Jesuites, and of <hi>Garrard</hi> and <hi>Tresmond</hi> (Jesuitical Priests likewise) who by their Apostolical Power did commend the fact, and absolve the actors. The Oath was given them by the said <hi>Garrard</hi> in these words;
<q>You shall swear by the blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and by the Sacrament you now purpose to receive, never to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close, directly nor indirectly, by word, or circumstance, the matter that shall be proposed to you to keep se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, nor desist from the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof until the rest shall give you leave.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Project being thus far carried on, in the next place the first thing they sought after was an house wherein they might begin their work, for which purpose no place was held fitter than a certain edifice adjoyning to the wall of the Parliament House, which served for a withdrawing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95887:49"/>
room to the Assembled Lords, and out of Parliament time was at the dispose of the Keeper of the place, and Wardrobe thereto belonging: these did <hi>Percy</hi> hire for his Lodgings, entertaining <hi>Guy Fawkes</hi> as his man, who changing his name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Johnson</hi> had the Keyes, and keeping of the Rooms. Besides this, they hired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother house to lay in Provision of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to frame, and fit wood in for the carrying on the Mine, which <hi>Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> provided at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and sware <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es</hi> into their Conspiracy, whom he made the Keeper of those Provisions, who by night conveyed the same unto <hi>Fawkes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The appointed day for the Parliament being the seventh day of <hi>February,</hi> It was thought fit to begin their work in <hi>October</hi> before: But <hi>Fawkes</hi> returning out of the Country, found <hi>Percys</hi> Rooms appointed for the <hi>Scottish</hi> Lords to meet in, who were to treat about the union of the two Kingdomes, whereupon they forbore to begin their work: But that Assembly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dissolved upon the eleventh of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> late in the night they entred upon the work of darkness beginning their Mine, having tools afore-hand prepared, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95887:50"/>
baked meats provided, the better to avoid suspition in case they should send abroad for them.</p>
                  <p>They which first began the Mine were <hi>Robert Catesby</hi> Espuire, the Arch-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver and Traytor, and ruine of his name, <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> Esquire, akin to the Earl of <hi>Northumberland, Thomas Winter, John Wright,</hi> and <hi>Guy Fawks</hi> Gentlemen, and <hi>Thomas Bates, Catesby</hi>'s man, all of them well grounded in the <hi>Romish</hi> School, and earnest labourers in this vault of Villany, so that by <hi>Christmas-eve</hi> they had brought the Mine under an entry adjoyning to the wall of the Parliament House, underpropping the earth as they went with their framed tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor till that day were they seen abroad of any man.</p>
                  <p>During this undermining, much consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was had how to order the rest of the business when the deed should be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished: the first was how to surprise the next heir to the Crown: for though they doubted not but that Prince <hi>Henry</hi> would accompany his Father, and perish with him, yet they suspected that Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> as too young to attend the Parliament, would escape the train, and perchance be so careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guarded, and attended at Court that he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95887:50"/>
would be gotten into their hands hardly, but <hi>Percy</hi> offered to be the remover of this rub, resolving with some other Gentlemen to enter the Dukes Chamber, which by reason of his acqaintance he might well do, and others of his like acquaintance should be placed at several doors of the Court, so that when the blow was given, and all men in a maze, then would he carry away the Duke, which he presumed would be easily done, the most of the Court being then absent, and for such as were present, they would be altogether unprovided for resistance.</p>
                  <p>For the surprize of the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was held a matter of far less difficulty, She remaining at <hi>Comb Abby</hi> in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> with the Lord <hi>Harrington,</hi> and <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, Catesby</hi>'s house being not far from the same, whither under a pretence of hunting upon <hi>Dunsmore</hi> Heath, many Catholicks should be assembled, who knowing for what purpose they were met had the full liberty in that distracted time to provide Money, Horses, Armour and other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for War, under pretence of strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and guarding the heir apparent to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>Then it was debated what Lords they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95887:51"/>
should save from the Parliament, and it was agreed that they should keep as many as they could that were Catholicks or favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of them: but that all others should feel the smart, and that the Treason should be charged upon the <hi>Puritans</hi> to make them more odious to the World.</p>
                  <p>Next it was controverted what forreign Princes they should make privy to this Plot, seeing they could not enjoyn them to secresie, nor oblige them by Oath, and this much troubled them. For though <hi>Spain</hi> was held fittest to second their Plot, yet he was slow in his preparations, and <hi>France</hi> was too near and too dangerous to be dealt with, and how the <hi>Hollanders</hi> stood affected to <hi>England</hi> they knew very well. But while they were thus busying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and tormenting their brains, the Parliament was adjourned to the fifth day of <hi>October</hi> ensuing, whereupon they brake off both discourse and work till <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass,</hi> and then they laid in powder, and other provisions, beginning their work again, and having in the mean time taken into their company <hi>Christopher Wright,</hi> and <hi>Robert Winter</hi>; being first sworn, and receiving the Sacrament for secresie; the Foundation Wall of the Parliament House
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95887:51"/>
being very hard, and nine Foot thick, with great difficulty they Wrought half through; <hi>Fawkes</hi> being their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel to give warning when any came near, that the Noise in Digging might not be heard.</p>
                  <p>The Labourers thus working into the Wall, were surprized with a great fear, and casting away their digging Tools, betook themselves to their Weapons, having suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient shot, and powder in the house, and fully resolving rather to dye in the place than to yield or be taken. The cause of this their fear was a noise that they heard in a Room under the Parliament House, under which they meant to have Mined, which was directly under the Chair of State; but now all on a sudden they were at a stand, and their countenances cast each upon other, as doubtful what would be the issue of this their Enterprize. <hi>Fawkes</hi> scouted out to see what he could discover abroad, and finding all safe and free from suspition, he returned and told them that the noise was only occasioned by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of Coals that were now upon Sale, and that the Cellar was to be let, which would be more commodious for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and also would save their labour for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95887:52"/>
the Mine. Hereupon <hi>Thomas Porcy</hi> under pretence of stowage for his Winter Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Coals, went and hired the Cellar, which done they began a new conference, wherein <hi>Catesby</hi> found the weight of the whole work too heavy for himself alone to support: for besides the maintenance of so many persons, and the several houses for the several uses hired and paid for by him, the Gunpowder and other Provisions would rise to a very great sum, and indeed too much for one mans Purse. He desired there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that himself, <hi>Percy,</hi> and one more might call in such persons as they thought fit to help to maintain the charge, alledging that they knew men of worth and wealth that would willingly assist, but were not willing that their names should be known to the rest. This request, as necessary, was approved, and therefore ceasing to dig any further in the Vault, knowing that the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar would be fitter for their purpose, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into it twenty Barrels of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which they covered with a Thousand Billets, and five hundred Faggots, so that now their Lodging Rooms were cleared of all suspicious Provision, and might be freely entered into without danger of disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95887:52"/>But the Parliament being again proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued to the Fifth of <hi>November</hi> following, these persons thought fit that for a while they should again disperse themselves (all things being already in so good a forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that <hi>Guy Fawkes</hi> should go over to acquaint Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Hugh Owen</hi> with these their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,) yet so, as the Oath of Secresie should be first taken by them. For their design was to have Sir <hi>William Stanleys</hi> presence so soon as the fatal blow should be given, to be a leader to their intended Stratagems, whereof (as they thought) they should have great need, and that <hi>Owen</hi> should remain where he was, to hold correspondency with forreign Princes, to allay the odiousness of the fact, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Treason to the discontented <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fawkes</hi> coming into <hi>Flanders</hi> found <hi>Owen,</hi> unto whom, after the Oath, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Plot, which he very well appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of; but Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> being now in <hi>Spain, Owen</hi> said that he would hardly be drawn into the business, having Suits at this time in the <hi>English</hi> Court: yet he promised to engage him all that he could, and to send into <hi>England</hi> with the first, so
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95887:53"/>
soon as their Plot had taken effect: Upon this, <hi>Fawkes</hi> to avoid further suspicion, kept still in <hi>Flanders</hi> till the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> and then returning, received the Keys of the Cellar, and laid in more Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Billets and Faggots, which done he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into the Countrey, and there kept till the end of <hi>October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Percy,</hi> meeting at the <hi>Bath,</hi> it was there conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that because th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir number was but few, <hi>Catesby</hi> himself should have power to call in whom he would to assist their design, by which authority he took in Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> of <hi>Rutlandshire,</hi> and <hi>Francis Tresham</hi> Esquire of <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> both of them of sufficient state and wealth: For Sir <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> offered fifteen hundred pounds to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Action, and <hi>Tresham</hi> two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. But <hi>Percy</hi> disdaining that any should out-run him in evil, promised four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds out of the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlands</hi> Rents, and ten swift horses to be used when the blow was past. Against which time to provide Ammunition, <hi>Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> also took in <hi>Ambrose Rookwood,</hi> and <hi>John Grant,</hi> two Recusant Gentlemen, and without doubt others were acquainted also with it, had these two grand Electors been
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95887:53"/>
aprehended alive, whose own tongues only could have given an account of it.</p>
                  <p>The business being thus forwarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by their complices, they at home were no less active: For <hi>Percy, Winter,</hi> and <hi>Fawkes</hi> had stored the Cellar with thirty six Barrels of Gunpowder, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of shot, had laid upon them barrs of Iron, logs of timber, massie stones, Iron Crowes, Pick-axes, and all their working tools: and to cover all, great store of Billets and Faggots, so that nothing was wanting against that great and terrible day. Neither were the Priests and Jesuits slack on their parts, who usually concluded their Masses with prayers for the good success of their expected hopes, about which <hi>Garnet</hi> made these Verses,

                  <p>His Majesty after reading this Letter, pausing a while, and then reading it again, delivered his judgment, that the stile of it was too quick and pithy to be a Libel, proceeding from the superfluities of an idle brain, and by these words, <hi>That they should receive a terrible blow at this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet not see who hurt them</hi>; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently apprehended, that a sudden danger by a blast of Gunpowder was intended by some base villain in a corner, though no Insurrection, Rebellion, or desperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt appeared: and therefore wished that the Rooms under the Parliament House should be throughly searched, before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or Peers should sit therein: Hereupon it was concluded that the Lord <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> (according to his Office) should view all the Rooms above and below: but yet to prevent idle rumours, and to let things ripen further, it was resolved that this search should be deferred till <hi>Munday,</hi> the day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the Parliament, and that then it should be done with a seeming slight eye to avoid suspect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95887:55"/>According to this conclusion, the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> upon <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> in the afternoon, accompanied with the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> repaired into those under Romes, and finding the Cellar so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stored with Wood and Coals, demanded of <hi>Fawkes,</hi> the counterfeit <hi>Johnson,</hi> who stood there attending as a servant of small repute, <hi>Who owed the place?</hi> He answered that the Lodgings belonged to Master <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Percy,</hi> and the Cellar also to lay in his Winter Provision, himself being the Keeper of it, and Master: <hi>Percy</hi>'s servant: whereunto the Earl, as void of any suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, told him that his Master was well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided against Winter blasts: But when they were come forth, the Lord <hi>Montea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> told him that he did much suspect <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> to be the Inditer of the Letter, knowing his affection in Religion, and the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship betwixt them professed, so that his heart gave him (as he said) when he heard <hi>Percy</hi> named, that his hand was in the Act.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> returning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the King and Council what he had seen, and the suspition that the Lord <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teagle</hi> had of <hi>Percy,</hi> and himself of <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> his man, all which increased his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties jealousie, so that he insisted (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95887:56"/>
to the opinion of some) that a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er search should be made, and the Billets and Coals turned up to the bottom: and accordingly the search was concluded to be made, but under colour of search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for certain Hangings belonging to the house, which were missing and conveyed away.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Knevet</hi>) a Gentleman of His Majesties Privy Chamber) was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed herein, who about midnight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament was to begin, went to the place with a small, but trusty number of persons: And at the door of the entrance to the Cellar, finding one (who was <hi>Guy Fawkes</hi>) at so unseasonable an hour cloked, and booted, he apprehended him, and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacking the Billet, he found the Serpents nest stored with thirty six barrels of Powder, and then searching the Villain, he found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him a dark Lanthorn three Matches, and other instruments for blowing up the Powder: And being no whit daunted, he instantly confessed his guiltiness, and was so far from Repentance, as he vowed, that had he been within the house (as indeed he was but immediately come forth from his work) he would certainly have blown up the House with himself and them all: And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95887:56"/>
being brought before the Council; he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented nothing so much as because the deed was not done, saying, that <hi>the Devil, and not God was the discoverer of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As desperate were <hi>Catesby, Percy,</hi> and the rest, who seeing the Treason discover'd, posted all into <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> where <hi>Grant,</hi> and his associates had broken open the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles belonging to <hi>Warwick</hi> Castle, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken some gaeat horses out of the same, to forward their hoped for great day. At <hi>Dun-Church</hi> Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> had made a match for a great hunting, that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence thereof they might seize upon the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Elizabeth</hi> then at <hi>Comb Abby,</hi> but when by those which posted from <hi>London</hi> they were informed that they were discovered, and pursued, being struck with a great fear; not knowing whither to sly, they desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly began an open Rebellion, pretending that they did it for the cause of Religion, all the Catholicks throats being intended to be cut, and so trooping together they wandred through <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> being pursued by Sir <hi>Richard Verney,</hi> the then High Sheriff, and from thence they went through <hi>Worcester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> into <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> their servants, and followers being about eighty men, who also stole away many of them from them. Thus
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95887:57"/>
ranging about, and finding no resistance, they rifled the Lord <hi>Windsors</hi> house of all the Armour, Shot, Powder, and all other Warlike Provisions: but the weather being rainy, and the Waters somewhat high, the Powder in carriage took wet, and so became unserviceable.</p>
                  <p>For their last refuge they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to <hi>Holbach</hi> House in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Steven Littleton,</hi> whither they were pursued by the High Sheriff of <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stershire,</hi> who not knowing of the Treason, and thinking it to be only some fray, or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, sent his Trumpeter unto them, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to render themselves to him His Majesties Minister: But their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces witnessing what the Sheriff knew not, answered, <hi>that he had need of greater assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance than of those few that were with him, before he could be able to command or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul them:</hi> and so they prepared for resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and having laid two pounds of the said Powder into a Platter to dry in the chimney, one coming to mend the fire, threw in a Billet, whereby a spark flew into the Powder, whose sudden blast was so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that though so small a quantity, it blew up the roof of the house, scorching the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and faces of <hi>Catesby, Rookwood,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95887:57"/>
                     <hi>Grant,</hi> and some others, whose consciences now told tdem that God had puished them justly with Powder, who with Powder would have destroyed so many. Being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirited with this accident, yet like desperate men, they resolved to die together, set open the Gates, and suffered the Sheriffs men to rush in upon them, and presently both the <hi>Wrights</hi> were shot down dead: <hi>Rookwood</hi> and <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> were very sorely woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Percy</hi> desperately fighting back to back, were both shot thorow, and slain with one Musket bullet: the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, were carried prisoners to <hi>London,</hi> being all the way gazed at, reviled, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested by the common people for their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, and horrible Treason: and so at last they received the just guerdon of their wickedness.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have seen this work of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by the watchfulnes of Gods providence detected, and defeated, and the contrivers of mischief fallen into the pit that they digged for others: Now let us see also how cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly they contrived the transferring the <hi>Odium</hi> of it upon the Puritans.</p>
                  <p>There was one Mr. <hi>Pickering of Tich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marsh-Grove</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire</hi> that was in great esteem with King <hi>James.</hi> This
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95887:58"/>
Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> had a horse of special note for swiftness on which he used to hunt with the King. A little before the blow was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Mr. <hi>Keies,</hi> on of the conspirators, and brother in Law to Mr. <hi>Pickering,</hi> borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this horse of him, and conveyed him to <hi>London</hi> upon a bloody design, which was thus contrived. <hi>Fawkes</hi> upon the day of the fatal blow was appointed to retire himself into St. <hi>Georges</hi> fields, where this horse was to attend him to further his escape (as they made him believe) so soon as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment House should be blown up. It was likewise contrived, that Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> who was noted for a Puritan, should that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be murthered in his bed, and secretly conveyed away: As also that <hi>Fawkes</hi> so soon as he came into St. <hi>Georges</hi> fields to escape, should be there murthered, and so mangled that he could not be known: whereupon it was to be bruited abroad that the Puritans had blown up the Parliament House, and the better to make the World believe it, there was Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> with his choice Horse ready to make an escape, but that stirred up some, who seeing the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness of the fact, and him ready to escape, in detestation of so horrible a deed, fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and hewed him in pieces, and to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95887:58"/>
make it more clear, there was his horse, known to be of special speed, and swiftness, ready to carry him away, and upon this ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour a Massacre should havy gone through the whole Land upon the Puritans. When the contrivance of this Plot was thus disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by some of the Conspirators, and <hi>Fawkes,</hi> who was now a Prisoner in the Tower made acquainted with it, whereas before he was made to believe by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions that he should be bountifully rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for that his good service to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick cause, now perceiving that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary his death had been contrived by them, he thereupon freely confessed all that he knew concerning that horrid conspiracy, which before all the tortures of the rack could not force him unto.</p>
                  <p>The truth of all this was attested by Mr. <hi>William Perkins,</hi> an eminent Christian and Citizen of <hi>London</hi> to Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> had it from the mouth of Mr. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Cotton</hi> that made our <hi>English</hi> Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, who also had it from the Relation of Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> himself.</p>

                  <head>A Narrative of the visible hand of God upon the Papists by the Downfall in <hi>Black-Friers</hi> London. Anno Christi, 1623.</head>
                  <p>ON the Lords day, <hi>October</hi> the twenty sixth according to the <hi>English</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: but <hi>November</hi> the fifth according to the <hi>Popish</hi> account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a common report went far and near, that one <hi>Drurie,</hi> a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Priest</hi> (a man of parts, and eminent gifts) would preach that day in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon in a fair house in <hi>Black-Friers London,</hi> whither all that would might freely come to hear him.</p>
                  <p>Upon this report very many, Protestants as well as Papists, Scholars as well as others, assembled thither about three a clock in the afternoon; That mansion house was now inhabited by the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador: and the Sermon was to be in a Garret, into
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95887:60"/>
which there were two passages: One out of the Ambassadorus with-drawing Room which was private, the other more common without the great Gate of the said Mansion House.</p>
                  <p>Under this Garret was another large Chamber which one <hi>Redyate,</hi> another <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi> Priest, had hired for himself: Unto whom Papists frequently repaired to hear Mass, and make confessions. Under this room was the aforesaid withdrawing cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Ambassador: supported with strong Arches of stone being immediately over the entrance into the great House: And at the South end of the Garret and on the West side thereof, there were Bed-chambers and Closets which other Priests had hired for themselves: The Bed-chamber at the South end was severed from the Garret on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a partition of Wanscote which was taken down for the Sermon time: The length of the Garret from North to South was almost sorry foot, the breadth about sixteen foot: The two aforesaid passages met on one pair of stairs leading to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret which had only that one door leading into it.</p>
                  <p>More came to this place then possibly it could hold, so that many for want of room
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95887:60"/>
returned back again; Others went into the aforesaid <hi>Redyates</hi> Chamber, and tarried with him. The whole Garret, Rooms ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, door, and top of the stairs were as full as they could hold. In the Garret were set chairs and stools for the better sort: most of the women sate on the floor, but most of the men stood thronged together: In all, about two hundred were there as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled. In the midst was a table and a chair for the Preacher.</p>
                  <p>All things thus prepared, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude assembled, about three of the clock the expected Preacher, having on a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, girt about his middle with a linnen girdle, and a tippet of Scarlet on both his shoulders, came in, being attended by a man that brought after him his book and hour-glass.</p>
                  <p>As soon as he came to the table, he kneeled down with shew of private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion for a little while; then rising up, and turning himself to the people, he crossed himself, took the book (which was said to be a <hi>Rhemish</hi> Testament) out of his mans hands, and the hour-glass being set on the table, he opened the book, read the Gospel appointed by the <hi>Remish</hi> Calendar for that day, being the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95887:61"/>
twenty first Sunday after <hi>Pentecost:</hi> The Gospel was in <hi>Matthew</hi> 18, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Text being read, he sate down, put on a red cap over a white linnen one turned up about the brims: He made no audible Prayer, but having read his Text, which was the Parable of forgiving debts, he spake something of the occasion of it, and then propounded these three special points to be handled
<list>
                        <item>1. The debt we owe to God.</item>
                        <item>2. The mercy of God in forgiving it.</item>
                        <item>3. Mans unmercifulness to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having insisted some while of the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of man by reason of the debt wherein he stands bound to God, he passed on to declare the rich mercy of God, and the means which God hath afforded to his Church, for partaking thereof: Amongst which he reckoned up the Sacaments, and especially pressed the Sacrament of <hi>Penance,</hi> as they call it.</p>
                  <p>When he had discoursed on these points about half an hour, on a sudden the floor whereon the Preacher and the greatest part of his Auditory were, fell down with such violence, as therewith the floor of the Chamber under it, where
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95887:61"/>
                     <hi>Redyate</hi> and his company were, was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down with it, so that both the floors, with the beams, girders, joyces, boords and feelings, with all the people on them, fell down together upon the third floor, which was the floor of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors withdrawing Chamber, supported with strong arches as aforesad.</p>
                  <p>There being a partition on the South side of the middle Chamber which reached up to the floor of the Garret and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it, that part of the Garret which was beyond the partition Southward, fell not, so as all the people thereon were safe, only they had no way to get forth: for there was but one entrance into the Garret, which was at the North-West corner. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon some through amazement, would have leaped out at a window almost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foot from the ground: but the people without, telling them of the certain dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger if they leaped down, kept them from that desperate attempt: At length by breaking a wall on the West-side they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Chambers adjoyning thereto, and so by creeping through that hole into the Chambers, they were saved: So were all they that stood on the stair-head at the door leading into the Garret: For the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95887:62"/>
stairs were without the Room, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fell but the floors, neither walls nor roof.</p>
                  <p>Also amongst those that fell, many escaped; for some of the timber rested with one end on the walls, and with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the third floor that yielded not, and so both such as abode on those pieces, and such as were directly under them, were thereby preserved. Amongst the multidude that fell, there was a Minister who (through Gods Providence) fell so between two pieces of timber, as that the timber kept his upper parts from crushing, and holped him by his clasping about the timber to pull out his feet from amongst the dead corpses.</p>
                  <p>Amongst others, the present preservation and future destruction of one <hi>Parker</hi> was very remarkable. This <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>Parker</hi> at this time took his Nephew, a youth of about sixteen years old to the aforementioned fatal conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95887:62"/>
where <hi>Drury</hi> preached: and both <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> and his Nephew fell with the rest: The youth there lost his life, but <hi>Parker</hi> himself escaped with a bruised body, being a corpulent man: yet so far was he from making a good use of his deliverance, that with much discontent he wished that he had dyed for his Nephew, saying, <hi>That God saw him not fit to dye amongst such Martyrs:</hi> Such are <hi>Romes</hi> Martyrs. But <hi>the preservation of the wicked, is but a reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to future judgment</hi>: For about ten days after, as this <hi>Parker</hi> was shooting <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> with his aforesaid Neece, whom he was conveying beyond Sea, they were both cast away and drowned in the <hi>Thames. Judge by this</hi> (O Parents!) <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God is well pleased with disposing your Children to Popish Education.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others there were that were pulled out alive, but so bruised, or so spent for want of breath, that some lived not many hours, others dyed not many days after.</p>
                  <p>The floor of the Chamber immediately over this where the Corps lay, being fallen, there was no entrance into it but through the Ambassadours Bed-chamber, the door whereof was closed up with the Timber of the floors that fell down, and the walls
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95887:63"/>
of this room were of stone, only there was one window in it with extraordinary strong cross barrs of iron, so that though Smiths, and other workmen were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately sent for, yet it was more than an hour before succour could be afforded to them that were faln down.</p>
                  <p>Passage at length being made, I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess into the room (saith Doctor <hi>Gouge</hi> the relater of this story) and viewing the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, observed some (yet but few) to be mortally wounded, or crushed by the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Others to be apparently stifled, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their thick lying one upon another, and partly with the dust that came from the cieling which fell down.</p>
                  <p>On the Lords day at night when they fell they were numbered ninety one dead bodies; but many of them were secretly conveyed away in the night, there being a pair of water-stairs, leading from the garden apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the house, into the <hi>Thames.</hi> On the morrow the Coroner and his Inquest coming to view the bodies, found remaining but sixty three.</p>
                  <p>Of those that were carried away, some were buried in a Burying place within the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadours House in <hi>Holborn,</hi> amongst whom the Lady <hi>Web</hi> was one,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95887:63"/>
the Lady <hi>Blackstones</hi> daughter another, and one Mistress <hi>Udal</hi> a third: Master <hi>Stoker,</hi> and Master <hi>Bartholomew Bavin</hi> were buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in St.<hi>Brides</hi> Parish. <hi>Robert Sutton, John Loccham,</hi> and <hi>Abigail Holford</hi> in St.<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews Holborn.</hi> Captain <hi>Summers</hi> wife in the Vault under <hi>Black Friers</hi> Church, and her woman in the Church-yard. For the Corps remaining, two great pits were dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, one in the fore Court of the said <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors house, eighteen foot long, and twelve foot broad; the other in the garden behind his house, twelve foot long, and eight foot broad. In the former pit were laid forty four Corps, whereof the bodies of the aforesaid <hi>Drury</hi> and <hi>Redyate</hi> were two: These two wound up in sheets, were first laid into the pit, with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of loose earth to fever them from the rest. Then were others brought, some in somewhat a decent manner wound up in sheets, but the most in a most lamentable plight, the shirts onely of the men tyed under the twists, and some linnen tyed about the middle of the women, the rest of their bodies naked, and one poor man or woman taking a Corps by the head, another by the feet tumbled them in, and so piled them up almost to the top of the pit.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95887:64"/>
The rest were put into the other pit in the garden.</p>
                  <p>Their manner of burial seemed almost as dismal, as the heap of them, when they lay upon the floor where they last fell. No obsequies of funeral Rites were used at their burial. Only the day after, a black Cross of wood was set upon each grave, but was soon by Authority commanded to be taken down.</p>
                  <p>When they were thus interred, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough search was made about the cause of the falling of the timber: The timber of each floor was laid together, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Summers that brake was taken. The main Summer which crossed the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret was ten inches square: Two girders were by tenents, and mortaises let into the middest of it, one just against another: the Summer was knotty where the mortaises were made, whereupon being over-burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it knapped suddenly asunder in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest.</p>
                  <p>The main Summer of the other floor that fell was much stronger, being thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen inches square, strong and found e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, neither did the girders meet so just one against another; yet that also failed, not in the middest as the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95887:64"/>
but within five foot of one end, and that more shiveringly, and with a longer rent in the timber then the other. For this Chamber was almost full with such persons as coming too late, went into <hi>Redyates</hi> Chamber: Besides, it did not only bear the weight which lay on the upper floor, but received it with a sudden knock, and so the massie timber shivered in two, and the people were irrecoverably before they could tear any such thing, beaten down into the third floor which was above twenty foot from the first.</p>
                  <p>It's true, we must not be rash in censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, yet when we see judgements executed on sinners in the act of their sin, when they are impudent, and presumptuous therein, not to acknowledge such to be judged by the Lord, is to wink against clear light, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 16.<hi>God is known by the judgements which he executeth.</hi> Shall <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> while he is vaunting of his great <hi>Babylon,</hi> be berest of his wits?</p>
                  <p>Shall <hi>Herod,</hi> whilest he is priding himself in the flattering applanse of the people, be eaten of worms? Shall <hi>Haman,</hi> whilest he practising to destroy all the people of God, be hanged on a Gallows fifty foot high, which he had prepared for <hi>Mordecai?</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95887:65"/>
Shall the House where the <hi>Philistins</hi> met together to sport with <hi>Sampson,</hi> fall upon their heads? Shall these and such like judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments overtake men in the very act of their sin, and yet be accounted no judgements, no evidences of Gods revenging Justice, or signes of his indignation? Truly then we may deny all Providence, and attribute all to chance: But add hereto, that this fell out upon their fifth of <hi>November,</hi> and it will be as clear as if written with a Sun-beam, that the pit which they digged for others, they themselves fell into it.</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>Gouge,</hi> who relates this Story in his <hi>Extent of Gods Providence,</hi> thus writeth.</p>
                  <p>I do the more confidently publish this History, because I was an eye-witness of many of the things therein related, and heard from the mouths of such as were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Sermon, the rest. For upon the first hearing of the destruction of so many persons as by that Dowosal lost their lives, our Constables presently caused the Gates of our precinct (it being surrounded with walls and Gates) to be shut, and raised a strong Guard from amongst the inhabitants to keep the house where this accident fell out, and to prevent tumult about it. Thus through the favour of the Constables, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95887:65"/>
Watch, who were all my neighbours, I had the more free and quiet access to view the dead bodies, and to inform my self of all the material circumstances about that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: which I did the rather, because the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> that then was, sent to me to inform my self throughly of all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and to send him a narration thereof under my hand; whereupon I did not only view matters my self, but caused Carpenters to search the timber, to take the measures both of the timber and the rooms. I was also present with the Coroner and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest at their examining of all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about the business. And the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Camerbury</hi> sending to me to come to him, and to bring with me the best evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I could, I got the foreman and others of the Jury, and four persons that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Sermon, and fell down with the rest, but by Gods providence escaped death, and one that stood without the door, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hearing, but fell not, all these I got to go along with me to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where I heard the witness which they gave to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bishop about this matter. One that fell with the rest, and escaped death, was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Gee</hi> a Preacher in <hi>Lancashire</hi>: two others were a son and servant to a Citizen
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95887:66"/>
in <hi>Pater noster</hi> Row: The rest were men of good understanding; able to apprehend what they saw and heard, and to relate what they conceived.</p>
