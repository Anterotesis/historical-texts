            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And this was the mayne occasion that I, (true friend) breaking the ice of my long concealed blessings, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, laid open to your view those christall, and abounding fountaines, which, who so tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, so instantly be-deweth his vnderstanding, with so recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Balsamum, that it spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the coldest Winter, and is euer fruitfull. This powerfull and celestiall water, is (as you beheld) enuironed with a guard of auncient Authors, of the most admired perfection in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions; and such, as from the riches of their wisedomes, haue left rules, precepts, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities; as legacies, regalities, and prerogatiues; by which all after-ages,

All these, though they bewray'd a willingnesse, to embrace you, and graunt you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse vnto that fountaine: yet through an auncient familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, begunne in childhood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene your selfe, and <hi>Cicero,</hi> which was one of them, you sought this courtesie rather from him, and hee gaue rather way thereto, then any other. And as he was euer of an affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble disposition, &amp; had beene well read in the conditions of all men, and, delighted to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, by the most illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnderstandings; hee so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted your inclination, that, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me from clensing, (as my custome is) and purifying that fountaine, he requested me, in
<pb facs="tcp:8414:6"/>
token of his affection, to present you with one volume of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles. I ask't him which? Hee answered; the Familiar. In what Language? English. Whereat I blush't, and smiled. Hee gathering, mine inward thoughts by mine outward car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, sayd; Blush not to bee made a Translator of so ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Bookes as mine Epistles; In that, things the more ordinarie they are; argue the more vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall acceptance: and besides, men of greater shew, haue held their translations of lesser mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for their greatest orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But blush to thinke that <hi>Cicero,</hi> whose letters bewray his conuersation, and whose conuersation was with Consuls, Kings, Imperator's, Praetors, Quaestors, Tribunes, Generals, and friends of his owne ranke,
<pb facs="tcp:8414:7"/>
               <hi>Caesar, Pompeius, Lepidus, Antonius, Brutus, Cassius, Cato, Plancus, Lentulus, Deiotarus, Octauianus,</hi> and such great Potentates; and at that time when all the world was subiect vnto one domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and himselfe in it a chiefe Commander; I say blush, to conceyte that he, should reduce such Epistles into Volumes, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for little ones. And wrong not thine owne iudgement so farre, as to imagine, that euery man of thy Nation, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, which is desirous, and worthy to read mine Epistles, is able to vnderstand them in their originall: goe on then; for those that ruled all men haue beene rul'd by me; be thou then ruled; and goe on. When I heard this, my shamefull blush was turned to a daring bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
<pb facs="tcp:8414:7"/>
which made mee replie, Commaund: but, thou art the whole worlds greatest Orator; and I, when these are ended, shall be but a young Translator; Let me bring thee a <hi>Sydney,</hi> a <hi>Great L: Chancellor,</hi> or a <hi>Sandys</hi>; that can parallel thy Latine, with our English Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. No, sayd mine Author; they haue done; doe thou. With that, I asked him, how?

But his speech was interrupted by the out-cryes of all men: because it was a

thing new found out, and without sence or reason. The Consuls neither assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him, nor were they greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant.

This controuersie endured till night, and then the Senate rose; and I, as it fell out, supt that night with <hi>Pompeius,</hi> lighting thereby vpon this occasion more fit than heretofore hath beene offered, as being the first Senate day, that hath since your departure prooued fortunate vnto vs. I so reasoned the matter with him, that he seemed to giue credite wholly to my discourse, and to deliberate how he might fauour you. Hearing his own tale, I must needs free him from the least touch of Ambition: but when I consider the carriage or passages of his familiar acquaintance, of what degree soeuer, I finde that assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, that at length is manifested to all the world: that all this cause hath beene before this time by some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and not without the knowledg or priuitie of the King himselfe, and of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8414:17"/>
his Counsellers. These I wrote the 14. of Ianuarie before day, in which the Senate was to sit. We shall as I hope maintaine our reputation in the Senate so far, as is possible in this so persidious an age, and full of iniustice. As for the popular respects, I thinke we haue so carried things, that nothing can be done with the people, without the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of diuine authoritie, or breach of lawes, no nor without compulsion. Yesterday the Senate ratified the things aforesaid, by interposing of their graue authoritie: to which though <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> and <hi>Caninius</hi> opposed themselues, yet it was registred, and I thinke it shall be sent vnto you. I will not faile to giue you good accompt hereafter of euery thing that passeth: and I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all my thoughts, endeuours, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and friends, in the effecting this businesse, to our owne contentment.

that, that the perfidiousnesse of any man can detract from you, in any thing wherein fortune hath inriched you.

And being of this minde, it vvas necessarie for me, as you see, that I should also fauour <hi>Caesar,</hi> hee being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard vvith <hi>Pompeius</hi>; to vvhich, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ancient friendship much moued me, that I and my brother <hi>Quintus</hi> haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaies, as you knovv, held vvith <hi>Caesar</hi>; partly, the humanity and courtesie, vvhich hee hath many vvayes in short time shevved vs. And to this, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Common-wealth, made great addition: seeming vnto mee, that it did not onely dislike, but strangely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, that there should be any conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with men of that quality.

were wont to bee such, as their Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</hi> I remember the first day of my Consulship, and often afterwards, that I might keepe the Common-wealth in a direct course, and at one stay, I layd so strong foundations, and in such a manner encouraged the Senate, that it was no maruell, though it carried it selfe so stoutly in December follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And in conclusion, I remembred: that from the time of our Consulship, vntill that of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Bibulus,</hi> men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in exceeding peace, and vnity; And vpon any occasion wee had to speake in Senate, our opinions had that esteeme that was befitting: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; at that time when you were Gouernour of the hither <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Common-wealth hauing no Consuls, but Merchants of Prouinces, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and ministers of seditions; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would, to giue occasion of war, throw mee into the midst of the Camp of discord, and ciuill contention. In which danger, the Senate hauing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily raised it selfe, and whole <hi>Italy,</hi> with the strength of the best men, in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and assistance: I will not relate what happened; because I should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of many; I will onely in briefe say, that I needed no army, but I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Commanders; And the fault was in generall of all those, which did not defend mee; but particularly of those,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8414:32"/>
which were tyed to defend me. And if they should bee reprehended, which were truely fearefull, they which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfetted feare, are so much more blame-worthy. Certainely, that dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of my minde was worthy of commendation; when seeing my Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens most ready to succour mee, and desirous, to shew me their thankfulnes; yet because they were without Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I would not put them to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with armed seruants.

And in deed, before I came into the Prouince I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued your letters, in which, though you certified me, of your going to <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> neuerthelesse you gaue me assured hope of our meeting.

                  </gap>mbassies went to <hi>Rome</hi> in your Honour. When I was in <hi>Apamea,</hi> the principalls of diuers Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties came &amp; told me, that the ordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ie charge of Embassies were so great, that the cities were not able to defray them. Then, I cast many things in my minde: First, I could not bee perswaded that you, who are not onely wise, but as the report now goes, a noble minded man, should be delighted in these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassies: and as I remember once in <hi>Synnadis,</hi> vpon the publique Tribunall I spake much thereof; alledging in the first place, how <hi>Appius Clodius,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further testimonie from the <hi>Myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densians</hi> (for that City was then men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) was knowne by the Senate, and by the people of <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And finally I concluded, that their good enclination lik't me wel, because they shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues thankfull to you, who had bene fitt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8414:74"/>
course no wayes necessarie: and if needes they would demonstrate their good affection, I should haue thought well of it, if some one had done it of his owne charge: And haue granted it; so that the expence had beene reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but not, if exorbitant. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore in any reason, take this ill at my hands: except, (as you adde) that mine edict had beene past, vpon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to crosse these legations; as some were of opinion. Now, in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they beare not themselues so ill, who doe such bad offices, as they, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

While I was yet in <hi>Rome</hi> I drew the edict; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, I annexed thereunto but one clause, which I tooke out of yours: and this at the importunity of the Tole-masters, who came to <hi>Samos</hi> to me, for this purpose; and touching the disburthening of the Cities of their charge, I wrote that article with speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and I annexed thereunto some new conditions, which gaue me good satisfaction; being so beneficiall to the Cities, as if I had herein restored to them their liues. But this poynt, which occasion'd all the suspition, that I went about to wrong you; is an ordinarie thing, put in practice by others before my selfe. And I could not be so foolish to imagine, that the Embassadours came to <hi>Rome</hi> for any priuate occasion;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8414:74"/>
as being sent, not to giue thankes to a priuate man, but vnto you; not for particular interests, but publique; and in an assembly not priuate, but generall to the world, that is, in the open Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Neither when I interposed this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I'le deliuer vnto you, what I can know, remaining in <hi>Rome,</hi> and therunto bending my minde, as I doe. I therefore affirme vnto you, that you shall not long dwell in these molestations, wherein at this present you are inuolued; but in those which also oppresse vs, I feare, you will euer continue. First of all I conceiue, that hee which beares all the sway, hath a very good opinion of you. This I write
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8414:107"/>
not without good ground. The lesse familiar I am with him, the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently I diue into his disposition. And therefore be secure, that he delaies your restitution for no other reason, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee would haue so much the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster occasion, to denie their suits with whom hee is displeased. Besides, all his friends, I meane those in greatest opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, stand greatly affected to your vertues, whereunto may bee added the peoples fauour vnto you, yea, and of all <hi>Rome</hi> besides. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer the Common-wealth, which, to tell truth; at this instant, is but weake, (but of necessitie it must recouer it former abilitie) with the same strength it shall haue, will constraine her gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, to restore you to your countrie. I said in the beginning, that I could not offer you my endeauour, and yet now I'le presume to offer you it: for I will seeke by all ceremoniall obseruance, to gaine, and binde vnto me <hi>Caesars</hi> friends, who loue me well, and spend much time with me; and by all artificiall meanes, I will studie to insinuate my selfe into <hi>Caesars</hi> amitie; which hitherto hath beene denied me, through my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer respectiue nature. In conclusion, take my faithfull promise, that I will leaue no waies vnattempted, by which I may thinke to compasse our ends: And in this I'le doe much more, then I

dare to write. In all other occurrents command me, for you shall see mee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the loue of all your other friends and kindred. I haue nothing in the world, which you may not esteeme as well yours as mine owne; But of this I'le dilate no further, being desirous that you should hope rather to helpe your selfe with your owne; as I hope you shall.

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:8414:113"/>
amities sake betwixt me and <hi>Pompeius,</hi> that they would diuert him from so wicked a determination. But hee, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I had been Consul, &amp; had preserued the Commonwealth, did me such an iniury, as was neuer offred to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Magistrate, of what mean rank soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; nor to the worst Citizen. For, at the last of December, as peraduenture you haue heard, he prohibited me, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation of my Consulship, to giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count vnto the people of my procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: which iniurie notwithstanding, at last redounded to my great honour. For, hee permitting me no further inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, then mine oath; I swore aloud, and the people with a loud voyce, and to my great glory, swore likewise, that mine oath was most true. Hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued this grosse disgrace; yet the same day, I sent to <hi>Metellus,</hi> those that were friends to vs both; requesting him to remoue that resolution, he had vndertaken against me; To whom he made answer, That it was not in his power: because, speaking to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he had formerly implyed, that there was no reason, that he should haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie giuen him to speake, who would not grant the same to others, but had punished them, without permitting them lawfull plea. Oh, what a graue Gentle-man, and braue Citizen was this! who, though I had deliuered the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:8414:113"/>
Senate from death, <hi>Rome</hi> from combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and <hi>Italy</hi> from war, thought mee worthy of that punishment, which the Senate, out of the consent of all good men, had inflicted vpon them, who meant to set <hi>Rome</hi> on fire; hew the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates &amp; Senators in peeces; and to haue rais'd vp, a most bloudy or cruell war. Vpon this, I oppos'd my selfe to your brother, who was present. For, the first of Ianuary, I so buckeld with him in the occasions of the Common-wealth, as hee might perceiue, I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted neither courage, nor constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. And afterwards on the third of the same moneth, hee hauing conuocated the people, in the beginning of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he went about to depraue mee, naming, and threatning me euery third word, with full resolution, vtterly to sinke mee; not by way of Iustice, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, but by bitter violence, and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate outrage. Whose temeritie, if I had not stou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if he did impart his minde vnto you, you sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>elfe to him, otherwise then fauorable. And, whensoeuer his name came in question in the Senate; I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ioyn'd with them in opinion, that proceeded mildly with him.

So, as I oppos'd not your brother; but I haue resisted your brother, neither was I towards you, mutable, as you write; but so constant, that I haue perseuer'd in louing you, though you gaue me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the contrarie. As also at this present, though you write to mee after a threatning manner, yet will I not complaine. Because I doe not onely pardon, but highly commend your passion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It's true, that if thy great losse grieueth thee, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the damage receiued; I see no course to diuert absolutely your griefe. But if naturall affection moue thee, to lament their miseries, that are dead: not to alledge now, what I haue often read, and heard vpon this argument: that there is no euill in death, after which if the soule liueth, it may ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:8414:131"/>
part aside, I will onely intimate vnto you one reason, which is very true: That such a danger is approaching to the Common-wealth, that euerie man should be glad to auoid with death. For what receptacle, shall honestie, bounty, vertue, laudable customes, good Arts, and finally libertie it selfe, and safetie, now finde? Questionlesse there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a young man or childe, of whose death I haue heard, in this, of all others, most cruell, and pestiferous yeare, which seemes not to me by the gift of the eternall Gods, to haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased from these miseries, and from this so bad a condition of life? So that if I could beate into your minde this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; that they whom you haue lost met with no euill, it would in a great part diminish your afflictions. For so you should come to retaine onely that griefe, which you feele not for their death, but for your owne losse. And surely it befits not the grauitie, and wisdome, which since your childhood, you haue alwaies manifested, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire for the losse of them, that feele nothing. Remember how you haue liued hitherto, with so great moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of minde, as it is necessarie for you to perseuere in the same constancie. And by wisedome and discourse, we must anticipate that in our selues, that at length time will bring vs: which by
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8414:132"/>
the remedie of yeares, healeth euerie greene wound. For if there were neuer so base a woman, which in the losse of children, did not at last cease lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: surely we are bound to draw that from our prudence, which continuance of daies will bring vs; and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the medicine of time, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son first propounds vnto vs. If these letters take effect, I shall thinke that I haue obtain'd my greatest desire: If they worke nothing at all, yet shall I iudge, that I haue done the office, of that friend, which I haue euer beene, and promise during life to be vnto you.

is; that you will prudently support, this common, and doubtfull accident: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, because none of vs can auoid it; doubtfull, because no man knowes, whether it will be of little, or long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. Defend your selfe brauely from griefe, and oppose Fortune; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluing in your minde, that both in our Cittie, and in other Common-wealths, many valiant, and innocent men, haue beene vniustly sent into ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Let me also tell you this: and would to God, I might not speake true; That you are depriued of such a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, which can procure no contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to a wise man. Concerning your sonne, if I should write nothing, I feare that I might seeme ingratefull towards his vertue: but if I should tell you, all that I iudge of him, I feare I shall renue in you that desire, and griefe, which you were wont to feele for the priuation of so worthie a sonne. But neuerthelesse you shall doe exceeding wisely, to thinke, that his loue, his valour, and his industrie remaine alwaies with your selfe: those things being no lesse our owne, that we embrace with our mind, then the same, that we behold with our eyes. His high valour therefore, and the inexplicable loue he beares you, ought to giue you great consolation. And you ought to receiue no smal comfort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that we and many others, so
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:8414:133"/>
much esteeme you, for the rare qualities of your minde: &amp; that this aduerse For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune abates no whit, of our loue to you; or of our iudgement concerning you. Whereunto you may adde another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; that as you haue not deserued this exile; so you should not much grieue therefore. For, wise men, when they are priuie to their innocentie, are neuer disturbed for any accident, that can happen to them. I, for the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie I retaine of our auncient friendship, and for the vertue which shineth in your sonne, and for the obseruance he shewes me, will be most readie to yeeld you helpe, and comfort.

Negligent; you supposing, that I neuer sought to bee acquainted with a matter, which did import my office so neerely, as it might proue preiudiciall to me: and that my Notarie, had set downe that, which he thought good, without speaking one word to me: alleaging, that if I had

mans ruine as yours. And for the other, I know you no waies stand in feare. It remaines that the generall perill of the Common-wealth, must needs peirce your heart; the which I turne to a kinde of consolation. And though learned men, prescribe many medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, for this so growen a disease; yet I feare, there is no other true comfort to be found, then that, which is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the fortitude of a mans minde. For if to liue well, and happily, it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that a man haue a cleare consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and doe all things conformable to Iustice: I thinke we cannot properly terme him vnhappie, who is priuie to his owne heart, that his secretest thoughts had neuer other obiect, then honestie. For I cannot imagine, that we left our country, our children, and our fortunes, for any hope of reward: but therein we thought that we discharg'd a certaine iust, pious, and requisite of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for the Common-wealth, and to our owne honor; not being so foolish, that we should repute victorie certaine. Whereupon if the same ensued, which formerly wee supposed might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, when we did enter into the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize: we must not abandon our selues, as if somthing had hapned, we thought would neuer haue come to passe. Let vs therefore beleeue (as in truth we may) that those things are neuer blam'd
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:8414:143"/>
in vs, which proceed from Fortune, and not from our selues: and being exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from this blame, we ought patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vndergoe those disasters, vnto which, the life of man, is subiect. Out of which reasons I conclude, that there is no man so sunke in miserie, but that vertue is of power, to preserue him. But let the lot fall to whom it will, of euery side you haue hopes, if any hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to publicke affaires. And here I remember, how you were wont, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend my despaire; and to encourage me to that warre, whereunto you savv me going against my will. At which time I neuer condemn'd our reasons, but our course. For I saw, that we too late opposed those armes, which had been much strengthened by our selues. Wherefore I gaue counsell, that such a warre was to be auoided, wherein force preuailed aboue counsell; and violence, aboue reason. And when I said, that, that would ensue which did; I presa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not what would come to passe: but onely feared lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t those miseries should happen, which I saw were likely to fall out: especially, that if I should haue giuen my censure of one, of two ends, I would surely haue promised that, which was most certaine. For we were superior in those things, which are not vsed in fighting; but inferior in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of armes, and resolution of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8414:143"/>
souldiers. Now, assume you, I pray ye, that courage, which then you thought I was to take. All the fore-mentioned I haue vvritten, because your <hi>Philargyrus</hi> discoursing before with me, and mou'd as I thinke, out of loyall affection, he told me, how sometimes you would be transported with griefe, which you should by all meanes bridle: being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that if the Common wealth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to her former estate, you may certainely hope, that you shall liue as honorably in the same, as any way is conuenient: and if she remaine desolate and oppressed, you shall haue no worse conditions therein then the rest. And this time, wherein vvee all continue doubtfull, and daunted, ought hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to seeme vnto you lesse grieuous, because you are in that Cittie, vvhere vertue grew, and was borne; vvhich teacheth vs, how to dispose, and order our liues.

Questionlesse, both long since, and many times, I would haue written to you, but that expecting dailie better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents, I desired rather to reioyce with you, then comfort you. Euen as short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I hope to doe; which will minister me occasion to write againe vnto you. Now, though I am inform'd and hope, that you contest with Fortune, out of a resolute minde: yet I'le see, whether with these letters, I can adde vnto your forces.

Yet many can testifie, how in the beginning I aduised <hi>Pompeius,</hi> not to ioyne with <hi>Caesar</hi>: and afterwards that hee should not separate himselfe from him. perceiuing very cleerely, that ioyning with him, the authoritie of the Senate was much impaired; and being separated, a ciuill warre would grow. I was a great friend to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and I loued and honoured <hi>Pompeius</hi>: but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> my counsell was loyall to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi> so both to one, and other it was profitable. Many other things passed, which I foresawe. Because I would not that <hi>Caesar,</hi> to whom I was much bound, should know, that if <hi>Pompeius</hi> had obserued my directions, he should haue beene in high state, and honoured of all the Cittizens; but yet hee should not haue had such a power, as now he

They came to armes: I stirred not: they went out of <hi>Italy,</hi> I staid as long as I could. In briefe, the care of my honor, wrought more in me, then the feare of life. I would not leaue <hi>Pompeius,</hi> because he had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken mee in my necessities: therefore to shunne infamie, like that <hi>Amphia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:8414:151"/>
you may perceiue the truth of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, you are bound to beleeue mee, as men vse to beleeue Augures, and Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, when they haue once spoken truth. Neither, doe I now goe after dreames, as the Augures are wont to doe, nor doe I marke how the birds flie, nor hearken I how they sing, nor minde how they eate: but I obserue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther signes: which if they be not more certaine then those, yet they are more easie to comprehend, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not so fallible. And my Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stication is grounded vpon two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. On the one side I consider <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi> nature: on the other, that of the ciuill warres. <hi>Caesar</hi> is benigne and clement, iust as he is disciphered in that booke, where you complaine of him. Besides, he loues noble spirits, such as yours is: and finally, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e will be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, with many mens entreaties: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they are not mou'd out of vaine ambition, but out of office, and charitie. The which all <hi>Tuscanie</hi> doing, 'tis to be thought, shee will be heard. Now, what's the reason, that hitherto, these things haue done little good? For he thinkes, that granting your returne, with whom, it seemes, he hath some cause to be angry; he could not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deny it many others. Oh, you'le say, what may I hope for then? if he be angry with me? he conceiues, that he
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:8414:151"/>
may extract his praises from the same fountaine, by whose drops, hee was formerly made wet, or dashed. Finally, he is a man of great wit, and prudent discourse. He see'th plainely, that he cannot long keepe you out of your Countrie, you being in <hi>Tuscanie,</hi> which is no base part of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He will not that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after you should acknowledge this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit rather from the time, then now from him. I haue spoken of <hi>Caesar</hi>: Now I'le speake of the nature of the ciuill warres. There is no man such an enemy to that enterprise, which <hi>Pomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherein I am wont to admire the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, iustice, and wisedome of <hi>Caesar</hi>: He neuer speakes but honorably of <hi>Pompeius</hi>: Oh, but he hath perform'd against him, many terribly actions. The blame is not <hi>Caesars,</hi> but of armes, and of the victory. Doe but marke vs: how hath he embraced vs? He made <hi>Cassius</hi> his Legate; He hath giuen the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Fraun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:8414:152"/>
wisht. What can I therefore inferre? Take the world what forme it will, the nature of things, and of ciuill warres, will neuer permit, but that in one, and the selfe same cause, all may haue the same condition: and that good men, and good cittizens, that are innocent, may returne into that Cittie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into so many guiltie banished men are returned. This is my prognostication: of which if I made any doubt, I would rather vse that consolation, with which you being a valiant man, as you are, I might easily suppose to comfort you: That if you had taken vp armes, for the Common-wealth, (for so you then thought) with certaine hope of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, you should not haue beene much to be commended; but had you imagined, it might so come to passe, that we should be vanquish't, the end of warre being vncertaine: it would haue beene a thing most vnbeseeming you, not to haue beene constant in aduerse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; as you would haue beene discreet, and moderate in prosperous. I would discourse yet farther; how much it would refresh you, to call to mind, that your deeds tended to a good end; And how delight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:8414:152"/>
with you. For other mens examples, reducing that law to memorie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all men, are constrained to obey, extenuate our griefe. Besides this, I would aduertise you, in how great an hauak and confussion of things we liue: in that we should lesse grieue to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priu'd of our countrie, when it is in ill state, then when it is well: but I would not haue you thinke of this reason. For out of hand, as I hope, nay, rather as I plainely discerne, we shall see you, in honor, and safetie. In the meane while, although I haue at many other times performed this office: neuerthelesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Caesar,</hi> and his friends do shew me euery day better countenance, I more confidently promise you, my paines, my endeuour, my loue, and my labour.

This hope I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, for all men, but for your person, I may haue it farre greater, being secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereof, by his nearest fauorites: to whom since newes first came out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> I haue not ceased to sue, together with your brothers: who are so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to procure your returne, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly beleeue, that <hi>Caesar</hi> seeing their valour, and singular affection towards you, will graunt what they would: and if the matter suffer some longer delay, then we could wish; it is, because we cannot haue audience from him, being exceedingly busied, in that hee must giue answere to so many demaunds. And moreouer, being prouoked against them, that haue renued the warre in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> it seemes he hath a purpose to punish them longest, from whom he hath rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For certainely there was neuer a more delight some thing to behold: and peraduenture he thought it would not so haue past with him: and <hi>Dolabella</hi> himselfe had little hope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But if our Gentlemen had not had their eyes open; vndoubtedly, he had ouercome his sute: and his opposite would almost voluntarily, haue giuen ouer the enterprise. I doe not thinke you wonder, that <hi>Seruius,</hi> chosen Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the people, should be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Whose place <hi>Curio</hi> hath deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and in their hearts, who know not his gentle disposition, he hath imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a strange feare. But as I hope, and desire, and as he makes shew, he will not start an inch from the Senate; nor from the partie of good men: he is now wholly for this. And that he tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him such a resolution, <hi>Caesar</hi> was the occasion, who not vsing to respect mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the obliging of euery man to him, how base soeuer he were; seemed to make little reckoning of him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I thinke, as also by others he hath beene aduertised, that a matter of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant admiration ensued, <hi>Curio</hi> who euer

I deferred to write vnto you, because the creation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates hanging in suspence, I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced continually, to attend vnto ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations: and partly I was desirous to tarry the end; that so I might aduertise you of euery thing; and supposing they would presently be dispatcht, I expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till the first of August. The creation of the Praetors, was prolonged, through certaine impediments. I know not how fauourable fortune will be to me, in the creation of the Aediles Curules. It is true, that in that of the Aediles of the people, manifest signes appeared more in fauour of me, then <hi>Hirrus.</hi> Of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Caelius Vicinianus</hi> I haue no feare. You know how we made a scoffe of him, when he said, that he would put on for the creation of a Dictator. The foole propounded it, and remain'd vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and many cries were heard against him. The same people afterwards see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue an extreame desire of <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi> I say to pleasure him ouer the shoulders. I hope 'twill not be long, ere you vnderstand that from me, vvhich you expect, and that of him, which I durst scarcely hope for. As for the state
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:8414:203"/>
of the Common-wealth, we did not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto looke for any new matter. But the one and twentith of Iuly, the Senate being assembled in the temple of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> and debating of the stipend that should be giuen to <hi>Pompeius,</hi> there was speech also of those souldiers, which formerly <hi>Pompeius</hi> had lent <hi>Caesar</hi>: how many they were; and how many they should be: so that <hi>Pompeius</hi> being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by a continuall importunity, that some ill tongued followes made to him, was vrged to say, that by all meanes he would call backe the said souldiers out of <hi>Gallia.</hi> Afterwards he was demanded his opinion, about sending a successor to <hi>Caesar</hi>: who replied that generally the matter of the Prouinces, should be put off till the said <hi>Pompeies</hi> return: who was to go to <hi>Ariminum,</hi> to the Armie: and presently he went thither. I think it will be treated of, on the xxiij. of August: and without doubt, something will ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be concluded, or some Tribune shall be nominated, that will not refuse the charge. But such an one will be blamed, because <hi>Pompeius</hi> in consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation hath said, that it were fit, that euery one should obey the Senate.

The contestation was great, each party hauing many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. Few respected merit; euery one assisted his kinsman, or friend. So that <hi>Domitius</hi> is my great enemy: insomuch, as hee hates not that acquaintance of his, whom you wot of, as he doth me: and the rather, because he thinkes he had wrong done him; and that I was the principall occasion of the iniurie. Now, he is starke mad, that men so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce at his crosse, and that I was so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable

Concerning the sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of the Common-wealth, I haue written ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to you, that I can yet discerne no peace. And the more this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie encreaseth, further then is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, so much more imminent the danger appeares. <hi>Pompeius</hi> is resolued, not to suffer <hi>Caius Caesar</hi> to bee made Consull by any meanes, before hee leaues the armie, and the Prouinces: vpon which the cheefe of the Citie will contest, that <hi>Caesar,</hi> except he first giue ouer his armie, and the one, and other <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llia,</hi> shall not bee created Consull. On the contrarie, <hi>Caesar</hi> is of a constant opinion, that he leauing the armie, his ruine will ensue. Yet he offers this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that both of them should leaue off their armie. And so, that loue, and discommendable vnion, turnes not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to secret hatred; but to a manifest war. I know not what side to take, and I thinke for the same cause also, you will be much perplexed. For one part I loue, and am beloued: in the other, I hate the opinions, not the men: and I think you know, that euerie one followes the more honest part, while they proceede
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:8414:219"/>
without armes: But when they come to a war, the strongest; supposing that to be most honest, which is most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in this discord: I see, that <hi>Cneius Pompeius</hi> will haue the Senate and Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his party; and to <hi>Caesar,</hi> all those will apply themselues, that liue in feare, or with cold hopes. The armies will not be equall: but there will bee time enough, to consider the forces of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, and to choose the best. I had almost forgot to write one thing to you, which was not to bee omitted. Know you, that <hi>Appius</hi> the Censor does miracles? Know you, that hee abates the pompe of statues, and pictures? that hee allots the measure of land? that hee constraines debtors to pay? hee thinkes the Censorship, is either paste of beane-floure, or niter: but in my opinion, he is deceiued: for, minding to purge himselfe of filthinesse, he opens all his veines, and all his bowels. Run, I beseech you, for Gods and mens sake, and come quickly to laugh at these nouelties; that <hi>Drusus</hi> is constituted Iudge of the accused, by the <hi>Scantinean</hi> Law: and <hi>Appius</hi> is about statues and pictures, I'le promise yee, you haue cause to come in haste. 'Tis thought <hi>Curio</hi> hath done very wisely, in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a stipend to be giuen to <hi>Pompeius.</hi> To conclude, will you know, what I iudge must fall out? If one of them go
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:8414:219"/>
not against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> I see cruell discords will arise, which must bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the sword. Either of them hath a great minde, and great forces. If infinite danger had not therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, Fortune had prepared for you, a great, and pleasant spectacle. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>

                  <hi>Caesar</hi> was in the prosecution of his courses, the same he will bee in pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his aduersaries; your conceit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues you. Euery thought of his, is cruell and rigorous, and also euery word. Hee departed angry with the Senate. These oppositions of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the people, vext him verie much. I assure you, hee will open his eare to no humiliations. Wherefore, if any affection towards your selfe, or to the onely son you haue; if of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or any other thing within your hopes moue you; if you haue any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to vs, or your son in law, so honest a man; you should not disturbe their fortunes, by imposing a necessitie vpon vs, of hating or abandoning that part, on whose victorie our saftie depends; or, by being an occasion, that against your preseruation, we beare wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions. Finally, you must consider, that what displeasure soeuer you could shew to <hi>Pompeius,</hi> you haue absolutely done it him, in this your delay. Now, if you thinke to stir against the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour; whom, while euents were doubtfull, you neuer went about to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend; and to accompanie them that are now put to flight, whom you would not follow in time, when they made resistance: 'tis the greatest folly of the world. Take heed, whilest you count it shame, with little care to prosecute

the office of a good Citizen, lest you be carelesse of your owne good. But if I cannot absolutely perswade you to what I would; at least attend, till aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements come, of the successe in <hi>Spain</hi>: the which I can tel you, at <hi>Caesars</hi> arriual will be ours.

Then, it disliked me to remaine long time farre of, from the custodie of the Common-wealth. For we sate in the sterne, and gouerned the Rudder: but now we haue scarcely any place about the pumpe. Do you thinke now, though I shall bee at <hi>Naples,</hi> that for this cause they will forbeare, to passe decrees in the Senate? when being at <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; attending to publicke affaires;

the decrees of the Senate are registred in a friends house of thine, my familiar; and when they please, they subscribe my name thereto, as if I had beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.

What must be done then? So long as this our master of ceremonies remains heere, I will neuerthelesse doe as you counsell me: when he is gone, I'le come to your Mushromes.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which thing, you wrote before vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, twice after one manner: so that I easily conceiued your dislike: and I had diligently returned answer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, to the end, that so well as in such an occasion, and time I was able, I might, at the least, in part, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether dispossesse you of your sorrow. But seeing in these last letters also, you shew what a care you haue of it: be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of this, my <hi>Paeto,</hi> that, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer could bee done with Art, (for now councell s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed, and procured with all diligence possible: and in my opinion, very successefully.
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:8414:240"/>
For, I am so honoured, and reuerenced by them, to whom <hi>Caesar</hi> wisheth well, that I beleeue I am beloued of them. For, though I could hardly discerne true loue from fained, except vpon some occasion, wherein, as gold by the fire, so true loue may bee tried, and knowne by some danger; for other, are but common signes: neuerthelesse, I build vpon this, rather then any other thing, to thinke, that I am heartily, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ruely beloued: that, both my fortune, and theirs is such, as there is no cause to dissemble. Then, as for him, who is Lord of all, I see not why I should feare; except in that, there is no security, where reason hath no authority. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can one promise any thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to himselfe, where, on others will (not to terme them appetites) euery thing dependeth. Notwithstanding, I haue not offended his minde in any thing: and therein I haue carefully v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all my dexterity and prudence. For, as other whiles I thought, that it rather appertain'd to mee, then any other, to speake freely; as to him, that had beene a preseruer of the common liberty: so now, seeing it is lost, I thinke it not fit for me, to speak any thing, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> may offend either <hi>Caesars</hi> minde, or his friends. But, if I should omit the occasion, of some excellent saying, I should lose the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion conceiued of my wit: the which,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:8414:240"/>
if I could, I would not refuse to doe. But yet <hi>Caesar</hi> himselfe hath a very good iudgement. And euen as your brother <hi>Seruius,</hi> whom I take to haue beene very learned, would readily say, this verse is not of <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Of the affection of the <hi>Galli,</hi> wee shall one day vnderstand, as you write, who was the principall occasion. But, I assure you, wee know it alreadie. Whereupon, reading your most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant letters, I was, towards the end, a little moued, in that you wrote; that if the creation of Praetors were put ouer to the moneth of August, you would come out of hand: and sooner, if they were created alreadie; not to appeare more foolish with your owne perill. Oh, my <hi>Furnius,</hi> how ill, you mannage your owne occasions. Considering, that you so easily learne to prosecute another mans. You suppose now, that you are to bee one of the elected, to stand for the Praetorship: and you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue, either to come in all poste, to be at the Creation, or else it being past, to come, to remaine at your owne house. And this you write, you'l do; affirming, that to proceed anie further in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the warres, were but a meere folly, for it would cost you too deere.

The maine point is, that you so steed the Common-wealth, that afterwards, all honour and Magistracie may bee due vnto you.

Wheresoeuer he passed, he set slaues at libertie, and tooke by force, whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he could: hee staid in no place, till he came to <hi>Vada</hi>: which place I wil discypher vnto you. It lies between the <hi>Appennine</hi> and the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and is almost impassable. I being some 30. miles off him, and he hauing alreadie combined his forces, with those of <hi>Ventidius,</hi> an oration of his was brought vnto mee: wherein hee began to entreat the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that they would follow him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> by reason he held cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencie with <hi>Lepidus.</hi> At this, shouts were raised, and principallie by <hi>Ventidius</hi> souldiers, (for, of his owne, he hath verie few) that they were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to die, or vanquish in <hi>Italy.</hi> And moreouer, they began to importune

him, that hee would goe towards <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia.</hi> He, not being able to withhold them, gaue order for his going thither, the day following. When I heard this newes, I presentlie sent fiue cohorts to <hi>Pollentia,</hi> before they should arriue there, and tooke mine owne way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwards. <hi>Trabellius</hi> arriuing with his horse at <hi>Pollentia,</hi> found my men, which I sent to defend it, there, an howre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: whereat I much reioyced. For, herein I thinke, consists the victorie. They conceiued some good hopes: for, they neither supposed, that <hi>Plancus</hi> fowre Legions, were equall to all their forces: neither did they thinke, that an Armie could so speedilie be condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of <hi>Italy.</hi> Against whom the Townes-men hitherto, ioyned with the horse I sent before, haue of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues couragiously resisted: and at my arriuall, I hope they will yet more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantlie oppose themselues.

<pb n="606" facs="tcp:8414:317"/>
(I hauing liu'd in pursute of honours) permitted not, that our mindes might with stronger knot be vnited through conuersation. Neuerthelesse, I knew well your good affection towards mee many yeares before the ciuill warre, when <hi>Caesar</hi> was in <hi>Gallia.</hi> For you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, that he wisht me well; honored me; and held me for his owne: the which you thought, could not but turne to my great benefit, and to <hi>Caesar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe rather profitable then otherwise. I omit, many things, which in those times, we were wont most familiarly to talke of, write of, and communicate. Because there are other poynts of farre greater consideration. I remember also that in the beginning of the ciuill war, when you went towards <hi>Brundusium,</hi> to finde out <hi>Caesar,</hi> you came to me in <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianum.</hi> First, what esteeme ought to be made of this onely demonstration, especially in those times? Then, doe you imagine, I can forget your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; councell; and affection? At which, I remember, <hi>Trebatius</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Neither are your letters out of my mind, which you sent vnto me, at that time when I came to meete <hi>Caesar,</hi> (if I be not deceiued,) in the territory of <hi>Trebula.</hi> Then ensued that time, when I was constrained either by the zeale of mine honour, my dutie, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to goe to <hi>Pompeius.</hi> What office,
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:8414:317"/>
or fauour left you vnperformed, eyther towards me absent, or my friends pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Whom did all my friends finde more kind to me, and them, then your selfe? I came to <hi>Brundusium:</hi> Now thinke you, that I haue forgotten with what celeritie you came flying to me, so soone as you knew it, from <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum?</hi> How great loue shewed you me, in your societie; discourse; and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of my minde; which was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed with extreame affliction, for the miseries of my countrey? Finally we began againe, to be resident together in <hi>Rome,</hi> where, in matters of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, about the manner, how I should proceed with <hi>Caesar,</hi> according to your aduise, I demeaned my selfe. And in other offices, you did afford this fauour to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and my selfe onely; to come daily to our houses; and often to spend many houres, in acceptable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. At which time, if you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, you vrged me to write these Treatises of Philosophie. And after <hi>Caesars</hi> returne, you intended nothing more effectually, then to make me do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall with him: Which you obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Now, to what end haue I made this discourse, larger then I thought to haue done? For this respect; because I much wondred, that you who cannot but remember these things, could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that I had wronged our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:8414:318"/>
For besides these which I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, which are cleare, and euident, I haue many secret passages, which with words, I can scarcely explicate. Your whole carriage giues me satisfaction; but aboue all, I am best pleased, partly [with] your singular fidelitie in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; your councell; grauitie; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie: and partly [with] your mirth; humanitie; and learning.

Your dignitie is so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that all mens eyes are fixed on you; and mens malignitie is the cause, that there is more liberall speech of you, then were befitting. And, if you doe not heare of these mutterings, I know not what to say. I, for my part, when it is my chance to heare them; defend you so farre, as I am sure, you are wont, to defend me against my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries. And I defend you two wayes. Some things there are, which I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed absolutely to denie: as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly; for this giuing of your voyce: some, which I demonstrate that you haue out of zealous loue, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse performed: as in that, about the charge of publicke sports. But you, who are most learned, know well, that
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:8414:318"/>
if <hi>Caesar</hi> were a King, as I suppose he was, you may for the office you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe be both praysed, and blamed: prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; because your faith, and humanitie is to be commended, for louing your friend after death; which reason I am wont to vse: blamed; because our Countries libertie should be preferred before the life of a friend; vpon which your aduersaries ground themselues. I much desire, that the controuersies I haue had about these clamors, might be related to you. But amongst others, there are two speciall particularities in your commendation; which no man infe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which though I would not forbeare to entreat of you, though I had not heard that you euer granted so much before: yet I entertaine more liuely hopes of obtaining it, seeing 'twas told me, how the <hi>Rhegienses</hi> had obtained from you the selfsame fauour. Who, though they be linked in friend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship with you, yet your loue towards me, bids me hope, that what courtesies you haue done for your owne, you will also performe for mine acquaintance. Especially considering, that, hauing many friends, which would sue for the like at your hands by my meanes; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest this kindenes only, for these men.

               <p>WHile I had the gouernment of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> to which Prouince, you know, that three Diocesses of <hi>Asia</hi> were assigned, I frequented with no man more familiarly, then with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,</hi> son to <hi>Arthemon,</hi> of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> And besides, that he was the man, who gaue mee entertainment in the same Citie; his customes also were very conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my condition: and he gaue mee much satisfaction, both in his life and conuersation. And, as I lou'd him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: so now, since I departed from mine office, my loue's redoubled: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I had found him, in manie occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thankefull and mindefull of mee. Insomuch, that I cheerfully entertain'd and respected him here in <hi>Rome,</hi> in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the honour, which I receiued from him in <hi>Laodicea.</hi> This I I haue written vnto you, both to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that I recommend him not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cause; and, that you may thinke him worthie of your hospitalitie. You shall therefore doe mee a singular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, if you make him conceiue, how much you loue mee; that is, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him to your protection; and, assist him, wherein soeuer honestly you may,
