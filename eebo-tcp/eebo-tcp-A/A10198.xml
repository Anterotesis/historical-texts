            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Your Lordlynesses have had above halfe a yeares time (allmost half as much space as most of you take to penn or conne your annuall or bieniall Sermons, and yet cannot get them perfect into your heads or hearts, into which they seldome sinke, but onely into your Bookes:) and yet have given no resolution to them, as people exspected you should or would have done: which makes many suspect, they have put you to a <hi>Non plus;</hi> either therefore answer them now, at this second Somony and publication, or els I and thousands more shall proclaime to all the world, you cannot doe it, and so are open enemies to his Majestie, his Imperiall Crowne, Lawes, Subjects, and in severall premunires, for all you beare your heads so high, like petty Kings and Popes: Yea I dare pronounce you perjured to his Majestie in the highest degree, by infringing your oathes of Supremacie, so oft reiterated: And as you are the first men inioyned to take this oath, by the Statute of 1. Eliz. c. 1. because the likelyest of all others to violate it, so you are more guilty of the frequent, open, and professed violation thereof, then all other his

Majesties subjects put together, who seldome infringe this oath, but either by your coaction or occasioning of them, by force or flatery to breake it, be sure you now give a fatherly satisfactory compleat answer to them with speed, at your utmost perills, and lay all other worldly imployments and affaires aside (as you have layed preaching by, long agoe) till you have done it, els these. Quaeligres will proove fatall to your Popedomes, Episcopalities, Consistories, Visitations, and elegall Ecclesiasticall Iurisdictions, and proceedings, and so I commit you to your studies for the present, as you (no doubt in imitation of your Saviour Christ and his Apostles, who had not any Pursevaunts, Iay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Messengers, and Catch-poales, attending at their heeles upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and many Jaoles and Prisons, to commit poore Christians and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters too at their pleasure, as your Lordships their Successors now have, though wee read not of them in any Author) commit others to your prisons and dungeons, and would doe me no doubt, if you could catch me napping, as Mose did his Mare, even for presuming to propound these questions to you in the behalf of my Soveraigne and Countrey.</p>

Tim. 2. 8.

R. 2. c. 5. which adjudgeth it <hi>Mortmaine, and contrary to the Statute</hi> of 3. and 4. Ed. 6. c. 10. 1. Eliz. c. 2. 8. Eliz. c. 1. <hi>which abolisheth and inhibites all other Rites, Ceremonies and formes of consecration (with all Popish Ceremonies and Pontificalls, wherein the manner of consecrating Churches, Chappells, and Church-yards is prescribed)</hi> but such as are onely prescribed in the Bookes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer and ordination, in which there is not one syllable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating Churches, Chappells, or Church-yards, or any one Statute of the Realme, or Canon of our Church since the beginning of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prescribing or allowing it.</p>
               <p>If they say, <hi>that the Temple at Jerusalem was dedicated, and that the Tabernacle and Altar among the Jewes was also consecrated.</hi> Ergo our Churches, Chappells and Church-yards must be consecrated by their Lordships. I answer.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That the</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">2. Chron. 6 &amp;c. 7. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Temple was consecrated by Salomon: and the</hi>

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:3611:4"/>
                  <hi>(who consecrated Aaron alsó and bis sonnes, and ordained them Priestes)</hi> neither of them a Bishop or High-Priest, therefore if any such consecrations are to be made, the King and temporall Magistrats ought to make them, not their Lordships, as Hospinian prooves at large, <hi>de Origine Obedirationum c.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 104. where hee concluds thus: <hi>Hoc autem authoritas antiquitus semper fuit Politici Magistratus:</hi> and that as well among the Pagans as Christians.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They had a commaund from God for the one; but their Lordships have none for the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>These Consecrations and purifyings were part of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law; and so quite abolished by Christ,</hi> Acts 10. 14. 15. Iohn 4. 20. to 26. 1. Tim. 2. 8. Col. 2. 13. to the end. Heb. 8. and 9. therefore not now to be used.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Temple, Tabernacle and Iewish Altars were conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated and hallowed, <hi>because Types of Christ,</hi> of which our Churches, Chappells and Church-yards are no Types.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The Iewes never consecrated their Synagogues (in which they had no Altars) nor yet their Burying-places, in lieu of which our Churches and Church-yards succeed: Therefore if their Lordships will imitate them, they must not consecrate Churches, Chapples or Altars, nor yet have any Altars in our Churches, much lesse take 20. 30. or 40. p. for consecrating them, as some of them have done, it being <note n="*" place="margin">Summa Angelica &amp; Rosella tit.
