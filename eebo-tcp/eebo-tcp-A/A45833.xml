            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Sober Requeſt to the Quakers:</head>
            <byline>Publiſhed by JER<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> IVES.</byline>
            <p>WHereas I have lately charged you in a publick Meeting, that you are <hi>no Chriſtians,</hi> and that your Friends of the Miniſtry are meer <hi>Impoſtors</hi>; which Charge you have endeavoured to evade with various put-offs, Alleaging that it was beſides the Buſineſs of the day; which is manifeſtly falſe: for, was it not the Buſineſs of the day to examine the Charge againſt <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi>? And was not this the firſt Article in your written Charge againſt him, that he writ a Dialogue between a <hi>Quaker</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>? Now this being the firſt general Article, what could be more material in order to his Vindication than for him to prove (or ſome one in his behalf, and the behalf of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity it ſelf) that you are no Chriſtians, nor worthy to bear ſo venerable a name? and if this be made manifeſt it can be no fault to oppoſe a <hi>Quaker</hi> to a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when I ſtill inforced this Charge, and by ſeveral motives preſſed you to vindicate the honour of your Profeſſion, by reſponding to what I had objected againſt you. <hi>Wil. Pen</hi> ſtands up and makes a Confeſſion of his Faith in Scripture expreſſions, which while you declaredly own ſuch Books (written by <hi>Quakers</hi>) as contain in them Doctrines no way reconcilable to Scipture-Language, or Chriſtian-Religion, but are deſtructive both of the one and the other, as I am ready to prove, it plainly ſhews that this Confeſſion was but a meer Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (an old art of Deceivers; who <hi>by good Words and fair ſpeeches</hi> do the more effectually <hi>beguile the hearts of the Simple</hi> and leſs wary Hearers) for, what if your Diſcourſes and Confeſſions of Faith be cloathed with Scripture-Language <hi>now</hi> more than formerly, this doth but render thoſe Confeſſions to be groſs Equivocations, unleſs you will renounce your former vile, abſurd, and nonſenſical Opinions, which I proved to your Face do make void all rules of Chriſtian Faith and Practice. And when by force of Argument I had driven you to that ſtrait that you could make no reply, and finding my ſelf under ſome indiſpoſition of body after nigh ſix hours diſcourſe with three of you, I thought it adviſable to quit the Meeting; which you making ſo ill an improvem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt of, for want of better Arguments <hi>Will. Pen</hi> crying out (as if he had been among the Boys in <hi>Moor-fields</hi>) <hi>They run, they run</hi>; others of you report as if I ran from the Charge, as being afraid or aſham'd to own it: I ſay, your ſo baſe and inſolent behaviour in my abſence, who had nothing to the purpoſe to anſwer in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, gives me the occaſion to let you know, that I am neither affraid nor aſhamed to make full proof of what I have charged upon you, if you <hi>dare</hi> appoint a Time and Place for that purpoſe. And then appoint whom you will to Diſpute the matter with me; provided none be admitted to ſpeak but us two, unleſs it be to correct any diſorders either in the Diſputants or Auditors; as alſo that a certain hour be agreed on for the beginning, and another for the ending of the Diſputation for that day; and that neither party ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the limites of that time ſo agreed on, unleſs it be by mutual conſent.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe terms I earneſtly requeſt a Meeting with you to prove theſe two things againſt you.
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That you are no Chriſtians,</hi> what ever you pretend.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That your friends of the Miniſtry</hi> (as you phraſe it) <hi>are Impoſtors, Falſe-Prophets, and men of lying Spirits.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now if you ſhall not by all this be prevailed upon to meet according to this Requeſt, I hope you will not take it unkindly if I conclude, that you that talk ſo much of the Light, care not how little you come at it, left your folly ſhould be made manifeſt; but if you take this for an unkind Concluſion, I hope this will pleaſe you (<hi>viz</hi>) that what ever you ſay of me, I ſhall pray that God would Convert you to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>; and Subſcribe my ſelf,</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Your Friend, <hi>JER. JVES.</hi>
               </signed>

            <postscript>
               <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
               <p>This Meeting is deſired to be diſtinct, without reſpect unto any Meeting that ſhall be a greed on betwen <hi>Tho. Hicks,</hi> and you, touching the matters you have objected againſt him.</p>
