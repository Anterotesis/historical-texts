            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE Of the Sitting Members that Serve for The Burrough of Southwark.</head>
            <p>THe Election began the Twelfth day of <hi>January,</hi> 1688/9. and upon the View it did appear the Sitting Members, had much the greater Number; but in regard a Poll was demanded, the Bailiff imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately complyed with it: and was proſecuted, perſuant to the Articles hereunto annexed.</p>
            <p>The Petition is in the Name of the Inhabitants of <hi>Southwark,</hi> who do pay Scot and Lot, and have the only right to Elect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It does <hi>allow that the Bailiffs has the right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and Ordering the Election;</hi> But complains that the Bailiff ſuffered perſons to Poll who had no right, and hindring the Petitioners to diſcover them.</p>
            <p>By removing the Poll from a convenient place, and continued it Three days at <hi>St. Georges</hi> near the Kings Bench and <hi>Marſhalſea</hi> Priſons.</p>
            <p>That thoſe which came to Poll for the perſons Nominated by the Petitioners were forcibly kept out, Beaten and Wounded. And returned Sir <hi>Peter Rich</hi> and <hi>John Arnold</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> when as (ſay the Petitioners) <hi>Anthony Bowyer</hi> and <hi>Edward Smith</hi> Eſquires were duly Elected by the Major part, who had right to Elect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer to this diſingenious Petition, The Sitting Members, doubt not to make it appear, That all the matters therein contained, are falſe and untruly ſuggeſted. For they will prove</p>
            <p>That at all times whenſoever a Poll was taken, the Burgeſſes were choſen by the Inhabitants, Houſekeepers of this Burrough, who did not receive Alms of the reſpective Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That in Five ſucceeding Elections theſe very Petitioners did give their Votes, as the Ancient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage of this Burrough,</hi> according to the Articles Signed by the Candidates.</p>
            <p>That divers of theſe Petitioners in former Elections did Poll for Sir <hi>Richard How</hi> and Sir <hi>Peter Rich,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Uſage now practiced, as being the Cuſtom of the Burrough.</p>
            <p>That all perſons who had right to Poll, had free acceſs in his Turn to the Poll-Table, where all neceſſary Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions were put by the Bailiff or his Deputy; That is to ſay, <hi>The perſons Abode, his Trade, and what ſort of Habitation he had, Before he declared for whom he gave his Poll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That to avoid all Conteſts and Diſturbance, in ſo great an Election; This Article was aſſented and agreed unto. That any Candidate might make his Queries upon any perſon, he ſuſpected to be a falſe Poller, and every night ſucceſſively, before the Books were cloſed; Copies of the ſame were either given or ſent to the Candidates on each ſide, to enquire after ſuch ſuſpected Pollers, to the end, they might be detected, and diſallowed before the Cloſe of the Poll.</p>
            <p>That in all former Elections where a Poll was demanded and taken, the Bailiff for Accommodation of the Inhabitants who are diſtant from each other, <hi>did take the Poll in the ſame places, they now were taken at.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That no Force was uſed by the Sitting Members or their Agents, the Conſtables who uſually attended the Poll, being generally inclined to favour the Petitioners ſide. Did uſe indirect means to feed the Poll with their party, thereby diſencouraging ſeveral that would have given their Poll for <hi>Arnold</hi> and <hi>Rich</hi> to decline it.</p>
            <p>That neither the Petitioners or the Candidates ever complained of any irregular or undue practice of the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff, during the taking of this Poll (which held ſix days) until the Books were caſt up, and the diſproportion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo great.</p>
