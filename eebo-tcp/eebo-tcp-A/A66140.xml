         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The earneſt deſire We have of bringing all the Counſels and Deliberations of Our Parliament to a happy Cloſe, and with as general ſatisfaction as is poſſible, moves Us upon ſome very ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſtop their proceedings for a very ſhort time, until ſome matters before them be ſo Prepared, and ſome Intereſts ſo Adjuſted, as their Unanimity thereafter may encourage all good Men, and diſappoint thoſe, who being as well enemies to Our Parliament as to Us, place much of their vain hopes upon apparent Diviſions amongſt them. If Our Affairs here had allowed Our Preſence with them, as We once deſigned, We ſhould have judged this worthy of Our immediat endeavours; But in Our abſence We have recommended to the Lord <hi>Melvill</hi> Our Commiſſioner (in whoſe fidelity to Us, unſtained affection to Religion, and to the National Intereſt, Our Parliament, as well as We, may juſtly confide) to take ſuch methods for removing theſe evils, with their cauſes, as may beſt conduce to prepare Matters for their Conſideration, and bring Our good Subjects to that Concord and Unity in Our Service, as ſhall make, We hope, that Meeting to be called, <hi>The happy and healing Parliament.</hi> We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Require you forthwith to Adjourn the Meeting of Our Parliament, from the Twenty ſeventh day of <hi>March</hi> inſtant, to the Fifteenth day of <hi>April</hi> thereafter, and to iſſue forth a Proclamation in Our Names, Continuing and Adjourning Our Parliament to the ſaid day, and Requiring all the Members thereof, to be preſent then in the uſual Manner, at the accuſtomed Place, and under the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications appointed by Our Laws. For doing whereof, this ſhall be to Our Commiſſioner, and to you a ſufficient Warrand; And ſo We bid you heartily Farewel.</p>
