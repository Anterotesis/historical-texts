         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Plain <hi>Discourse</hi> being
design'd at first, to go no
farther than the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> I
was by the late most Afflicting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
induced (as the Title Page
tells you) to send it to the <hi>Press:</hi>
Considering that a Discourse of this
Nature (tho' it can be at no time
<hi>Unseasonable)</hi> can never be <hi>mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

seasonably</hi> Published than at this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61714:3"/>
Iuncture; when there is as General a
Lamentation for the Death of our most
Gracious <hi>Queen,</hi> as we have ever
known for any Publick Calamity. And
my design herein being to promote,
what in me lyes, a due Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Hand of <hi>God</hi> in all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
and to instruct those who
need such Helps, how they are obliged
to behave themselves under them, and
how they ought to improve them; and
to lay before them the most Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Motives to such a Behaviour and
Improvement; I humbly hope it may
be in some measure serviceable to my
<hi>Country-men</hi> in affecting them with
such a Sense of this Heavy Storke, as
may have that happy Influence upon
them, which I have here shewed, God, in
His infinite Goodness, doth principally
aym at, in all the Evils that befall us.</p>
            <p>And because the quicker sense we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61714:3"/>
have of <hi>this Loss,</hi> there may be the
more hope of our Compliance with Gods
Design therein; and it being necessary
to the retaining and more quickning our
sense thereof, to keep fresh in our
Minds the Greatness of it, I can not
but take this Occasion to Represent,
with an Equal mixture of Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Grief, the <hi>Excellency of the
Person,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Greatness
of the Blessing,</hi> which we have lost.</p>
            <p>But since it would be too great a
Presumption (in <hi>me</hi> Especially) to
Pretend to give so full a <hi>Description</hi>
of Her Majesties Virtues, and Her
Natural and Acquired Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as may deserve the Name of
Her <hi>Character,</hi> I intend not mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h
more, than to instance in <hi>those</hi> which
lay <hi>most</hi> open to Observation: But
<hi>those</hi> are enough to speak Her, <hi>The
Glory of Her Sex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61714:4"/>
We had very Admirable Accounts
of Her, from Her Court at the
<hi>Hague,</hi> during Her Abode there,
from most Unquestionable Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which made us Envy our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Happiness in Such a <hi>Princess;</hi>
who <hi>Knew</hi> their Happiness, (as 'twas
impossible they should not) and had an
Extraordinary Value and Veneration
for Her. And since Her Return to
Her Native Country, and Her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
to the <hi>Throne</hi> here, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
knew a more Eminent <hi>Exception</hi>
than <hi>She</hi> was to that Common Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<hi>Minnit Praesentia Famam.
The Fame that Persons had when
Absent, suffers by their Presence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen had, to begin with Her
<hi>intellectual</hi> Endowments, an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quick <hi>Apprehension,</hi> and as
Clear and discerning a <hi>Judgment.</hi>
The late Arch Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61714:4"/>
hath more than once Expressed to <hi>me</hi>
great Admiration, at the Proofs He
knew Her give of these Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the weighty Affaires of State,
in the Kings Absences, when the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive
part of the Government was in
Her Hands. And, by the way, That
Great and Excellent Man, whose
Death is also much Bewailed, could
not have Chosen a Time for His leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the World, more happy for <hi>Himself,</hi>
than that which Providence Chose for
Him; since He escaped a very <hi>Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Shock</hi> by being <hi>taken away</hi> from
the inexpressible Loss we are now La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,
which was <hi>then</hi> at the <hi>door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen hath left also a Great
Name behind Her, for Her <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Prudence</hi> in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of whatsoever Business She
was pleased to be concerned in. And
in difficult Cases no Person certainly,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61714:5"/>
might more safely than <hi>She</hi> be trusted,
with that Advice of the <hi>Son of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach,
Let the Counsel of thine
own Heart stand.</hi> Several great
Passages which I have had from the
best hands do make me say <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Her <hi>Person</hi> was not more Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than was Her <hi>Temper.</hi> It was
so far from having the least Tincture
of Pride, or Peevishness, or any thing
distastful or disobliging, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of <hi>Deliciae Humani Generis,</hi>
might with as little suspicion of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
be bestowed on this Queen, as on

an Example of Condescending Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
Kindness and Sweetness, as <hi>She</hi>
was towards all about Her, or that

the Meanest of Her poor Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61714:5"/>
who were very Numerous. As
more of true Majesty was never seen
in a <hi>Sovereign,</hi> than in <hi>Her,</hi> So ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
appeared less of Loftiness, or of
Contemptuous Behaviour in a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>
In the several Yearly Courses of
my Waiting upon Her as Chaplain, I
can truly say, I could never observe
Her, to the best of my remembrance,
either by any thing she <hi>said</hi> or by
Her <hi>manner</hi> of speaking or by so
much as a <hi>Look,</hi> to be Angry or out
of Humour.</p>
            <p>She did not seem to have any thing
of Melancholy in Her Natural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
and yet, which is very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
She was at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the other Extreme. She
was Easie, Free and Chearful, but
without the least appearance of Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
She would neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e over whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Grief, nor transported with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61714:6"/>
Ioy, and yet was far from a <hi>Stoick;</hi>
Her Temper was sufficiently impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
She hath been seen to Shed Tears,
with great Tenderness, for the Death
of a Person She had an Esteem for,
and would Express a <hi>due</hi> Sense at the
hearing of Unwelcome Tidings; And
She had a great deal of <hi>Sympathy,</hi>
and <hi>Compassion</hi> in Her Nature, as
<hi>will</hi> be shewn: Yet She still bore Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
with great Patience; they
could not Extort from Her an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly
Word, nor make Her Uneasy to
any Body but Her self.</p>
            <p>Her parting with His Majesty once
a Year was always Grievous to Her,
and a Cloud afterward appeared upon
Her Countenance for a time, but it was
even Astonishing to observe, not only
how soon she Overcame Her Sorrow,
and Cleared up again, but also with what
Evenness and Composedness of Mind,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61714:6"/>
she could bear his Long Absences, and
the Thoughts of the infinite Dangers to
which He Exposed his Royal Person.
I say this was very wonderful, Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that She was a Pattern for <hi>the
Best of Wives;</hi> She always Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Tenderest Affection to, and the
Highest Value for, the King Her
Husband. And therefore it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for Her, notwithstanding the
Happiness of Her Temper, so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
Her self under such a Tryal, had
She not a great Faith in the Divine
Protection, being assured of His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Engaged in the Best of Causes.</p>
            <p>Such a Pattern was the Queen of
<hi>Sobriety</hi> and freeness from <hi>Vanity,</hi>
that I am sorry so few of our Ladies
could ever perswade themselves to have
the Ambition herein to resemble Her:
And that (contrary to the Custom,
which till this Reign hath <hi>here</hi> no less
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61714:7"/>
Prevailed, than in other Countries)
the Example of a <hi>Queen</hi> should be of
little force; nay of <hi>So little,</hi> as not to
be able to make such Childish Vanities

was so far from being lyable to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
upon that account, that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of great Worth, whose Office would
not let him be Ignorant of Her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
did sometime since Profess, that
<hi>he was very unwilling to say how
little she laid out upon Apparel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the Sobriety which relates
to the <hi>Palate,</hi> She was so far from
being fond of great Dainties, that I
heard Her once say, that <hi>She could
live in a Dairy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What an enemy She was to <hi>Idleness,</hi>
even in <hi>Ladies,</hi> Those who had the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61714:7"/>
Honour to serve Her, are living instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
It is well known how great a part
of the day they were employed at their
<hi>Needles,</hi> &amp; several Ingenuities; the
Queen Herself, when more Important
Business would give Her leave, Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them. And, that their Minds
might be well Employed at the same
time, it was Her Custome to Order one
to read to them, while they were at

            <p>And what a value She set on <hi>Time,</hi>
appeared by Her leaving Her <hi>Pillow</hi>
by Six in the Morning, and Her late
Returns to it: And by the <hi>Hours</hi>
which She daily spent in Her <hi>Closet.</hi>
And 'twas Admirable to see how She
would Contrive, to be as little as needs
must out of Business. She did not spare
so much as Her <hi>Dressing</hi> time from
it: Which was after She had been
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61714:8"/>
first in Her <hi>Closet</hi> about half an hour,
and then, after a Dish of <hi>Tea</hi> or
<hi>Chocolat,</hi> about <hi>two</hi> hours more.
She appointed Her <hi>Levy</hi> (that is
Her <hi>Dressing</hi> time) for the Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Petitions,</hi> and doing what other
Business could then conveniently be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch't.
And even <hi>now</hi> also would She
have Reading when there was a vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for it. And this was the time which
the Ladies knew to be most acceptable
for the receiving of Visits, because
then they would least hinder Business.
As for those Ladies who came at Her
<hi>Working</hi> time, they knew they should
not be welcome, except <hi>they</hi> work't
too.</p>
            <p>Between the Chappel-Prayers and
Dinner, She would commonly walk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Gardens, and there see how the
Gardners had observed Her Orders,
and farther appoint them what to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61714:8"/>
But we must return to Her <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi>
where, <hi>how</hi> She employed Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
we may more than guess, by the
Choyce Collection of Books She fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
it with; as well of <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
as <hi>History,</hi> and other Learned
and Ingenious Treatises; and by the
great improvement of Her Mind She
gained by them: Which those Worthy
Men who were Her Chaplains in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the Learned Clerk of Her
Closet here (who also for several years
waited on Her <hi>there)</hi> can abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Witness. Those <hi>Histories</hi> She
spent most time in, were such as by
which She might be best Accomplished,
for the most Difficult and Weighty
Employment of a <hi>Sovereign</hi> Queen.
And as to <hi>Divinity,</hi> She had been
such a Student therein, as well to
know, upon what <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
She ought undoubtedly to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61714:9"/>
the Gospel of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> &amp; the
Evidence we have for the Truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
And not only to have the truest
understanding thereof, whereby She
could well distinguish between the true
Teachers and the Corrupters of the
Christian Doctrine, but to be able to
defend it, and Especially against those
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion; Her
greatest danger, as I need not say, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been from <hi>that</hi> Quarter.</p>
            <p>And 'tis highly worth our Notice,
what a not able Insight She had into the
Errours of that Church, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandingly
She would Argue against
some of those Errours, when very
<hi>Young,</hi> and what a warm Zeal She
would even then express against <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;</hi>
for which she got the Name
of <hi>Queen Bess,</hi> from her Uncle
<hi>King Charles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a Second <hi>Q. Elizabeth</hi> She
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61714:9"/>
proved to be, both in regard of Her
immoveable Constancy in adhering to
the Protestant Religion, against vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Assaults, which have not hitherto
been made Publick; and of her great
Affection to the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
for whose true and just interest She
was much concerned. But yet Her
Love to this <hi>Church</hi> did not leven
Her Mind, with any sour Prejudices
against <hi>Other</hi> Protestant Churches,
as That of <hi>Holland</hi> found by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience;
nor lessened Her Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Sober Dissenters among Our
selves.</p>
            <p>I am as sensible as my Reader,
that I have now a little deviated from
the Rules of Method; but it is more
pardonable to give You such Remarks
as <hi>These</hi> in a less proper place, than
to forget them, when I have a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er
for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61714:10"/>
And now shall I need to add,
that our Incomparable QUEEN
was also a Person of most sincere
and Unaffected <hi>Devotion and
Piety?</hi> whether there be need of it
or no, I cannot decline this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>She was, if Comparisons may be
made, <hi>Most Exemplary</hi> in Her
<hi>Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very well Known, in the
<hi>First</hi> place, how strictly Conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
She was in the Observation of
the <hi>Lord's Day;</hi> and that as well
Privately, as in the Publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.</p>
            <p>As She enjoyned <hi>Preaching</hi> in
the Chapple-Royal after the Evening
Prayers (though there were always
Prayers, and a Sermon <hi>twice</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sunday Morning) and likewise
<hi>two</hi> Sermons, with the Prayers,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61714:10"/>
on all the Monthly <hi>Fasts,</hi> so was
She constantly a most Serious and
Devout Attender on them both parts
of those days. As She was also on
the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> the <hi>First</hi> Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
of every Month. And She was
observed to spend more Time than
ordinary in Her Closet, not onely
the <hi>Day,</hi> but also the <hi>Week</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
every Communion.</p>
            <p>Nor could any Business detein
Her from Her Private Chappel, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Morning nor Evenings, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Week. In all the Times of
my <hi>Waiting,</hi> I never knew Her
once absent. And whensoever She
had Occasion to go Abroad a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
She gave Order for the Prayers
before She went; or if She intended to
return to Dinner, She would have
them, tho' late, before She sate down
at Table.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61714:11"/>And whereas it was the Practice
in <hi>former</hi> Reigns, to have onely
the <hi>Second</hi> Lesson for the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Evening Service read in the
Private Chappel, She Commanded to
have <hi>both</hi> for the future. And it
so fell out, that I had the Honour
of <hi>first</hi> receiving this Her Pious
Command.</p>
            <p>But Her Piety was far from
being confined to Her Chappels and
Closet; She was <hi>every where</hi> a
like Pious in various Instances. A
Reverence of the Deity shewed it
self in <hi>every</hi> thing She said or did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who</hi> ever heard Her take the
Name of <hi>God</hi> or of our <hi>Saviour</hi>
into Her Mouth, in too light or
vain a manner? Tho' this Practice
is grown so common, as to be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
scrupled by very many, whom
we may not censure as not truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61714:11"/>
Such is the Force of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Custom.</p>
            <p>I do not, you see, speak of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faining
Gods Name by vain <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
for it would be much too <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
a thing to say of such a <hi>Saint,</hi>
that She abhorred <hi>this,</hi> but of all
<hi>irreverend Use thereof;</hi> but of
<hi>this,</hi> I say, our Blessed Queen did
make great Conscience.</p>
            <p>And so did She no less, of <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring</hi>
and speaking ill of Others,
and of all other Liberties, which
even great Professors of Religion
do too commonly give themselves in
Talking. And therefore She was one
of St. <hi>James</hi> his <hi>Perfect</hi> Women;
for saith he, <hi>If any offend not
in Tongue, the same is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is no Wonder, if She,
who could so perfectly govern Her
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61714:12"/>
Speech, should be as void of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
in all Her <hi>Actions.</hi> And it
is certain, that so She was.</p>
            <p>So Extraordinary Strict was Her
Majesties Life, even from Her
<hi>Youth,</hi> that for the <hi>Seventeen</hi>
Years of Her <hi>Married</hi> State, The
King, as he hath Professed, <hi>Could
never see any thing in Her,
which He could call a Fault.</hi>
And no Man can keep a Stricter
Guard upon his words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
is always observed to do.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Positive</hi> instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Queens Piety, or Fear
of God, they were such as shewed
She made no less Conscience of Sins
of <hi>Omission,</hi> than of <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might speak of the Pious Care
She took of Her immediate Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants;
and how concerned She was,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61714:12"/>
to have them secured from Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
when they had occasion
to go abroad. But I cannot omit
<hi>One</hi> Passage, which is an Equal
Instance both of Her Piety and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
She having condescended to
be <hi>God-Mother</hi> to a Daughter of
one of Her Servants, and calling
to mind those Words at the end of
the <hi>Office of Baptism; You are
to take Care, that this Child
be brought to the Bishop to be
Confirmed by him,</hi> &amp;c. She
not onely took <hi>this</hi> Care of Her
<hi>God-Daughter,</hi> but in Order to
Her due Preparation for <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
would instruct her Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and hear her say her <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism.</hi>
She did not think it enough,
to Command one of Her Servants,
or the <hi>Clerk of Her Closet,</hi> to
do this Office.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61714:13"/>
And how great a concern She had
for the Reforming of the Manners
of Her <hi>Subjects,</hi> in this very Loose
Age, appeared, by Her most Pious
<hi>Letter</hi> to the Iustices of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex:</hi>
Wherein She vigorously Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
them to do their Duty, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Oaths, in Executing the
Laws against Swearers and Curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and Profaners of the <hi>Lords
day,</hi> and all Debauched Persons.</p>
            <p>And Her Majesties <hi>Charity</hi> ought
to be taken notice of next after Her
<hi>Piety;</hi> in which most Christian Grace,
it is impossible So Excellent a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in all other Respects, should be
defective.</p>
            <p>The Queen could well distinguish,
between the Religion of the <hi>Means</hi>
and of the <hi>End.</hi> And no one can
be more sensible, than <hi>She</hi> was,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61714:13"/>
how <hi>little</hi> Praying, Hearing, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and the Sacraments do signify, to
those who place the Whole of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in such Things, as Necessary
as they are. She knew that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of these Great Duties, is the
making us more and more to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of a Divine God-like Nature;
the Subduing of all Corrupt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and inordinate Appetites, and
the making us forward to all Good
works.</p>
            <p>And it is Evident, that <hi>these</hi>
were the Ends She propounded to
Herself, in all Acts of Devotion;
as by Her great Proficiency in <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Virtues, so particularly by Her
Excelling in Works of <hi>Mercy</hi> and
<hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She filled Her <hi>Almoners</hi> with
Business of this kind, more perhaps
than any King or Queen Ever did
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61714:14"/>
in this Kingdom, within such a space
of Time. And tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not only in Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
at Home, but also in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Parts, among Poor Sufferers
for the Sake of Christ.</p>
            <p>And I have good reason to believe
from what I <hi>Know,</hi> that Her <hi>Own</hi>
Hands were likewise large Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of very Private Charities.</p>
            <p>And it is strange, that Her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
should serve Her to be so Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
as She was, in the Payment of
Her Private Pensions, at the Times
She had set for it, without being put
in mind of those Times when they
came. And Her Memory was no less
Faithful in reference to the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of Her Gracious <hi>Promises;</hi>
as I have known by <hi>Experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things, I say, are very
Strange, Considering how Her Mind
was always Loaded with Business;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61714:14"/>
and with Business of the greatest
Weight &amp; Importance, especially when
the King was Abroad: Which I think
hath mostly been for the <hi>greater</hi>
Part of Every Year. But it seems
She thought nothing could be of
<hi>greater</hi> Importance, than Works of
<hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Last Place, I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare
taking notice of Another Rare
Endowment with which Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
was Adorned, and which few
would expect to find in the Character
of a <hi>Woman,</hi> tho' a <hi>Queen,</hi> viz. <hi>Courage</hi>
and <hi>Fortitude.</hi> Herein
was She also a <hi>Second Queen
Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was Eminently demonstrated
by Her Manly (Her <hi>more</hi> than
Manly) Behaviour, when the <hi>French
Bravadoed</hi> it upon our Coast: And
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61714:15"/>
great Danger apprehended from our
Busy Enemies at <hi>Home,</hi> and of
Treachery in our <hi>Navy;</hi> and The
King then in very difficult Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Streight, the Queen
was now in, seemed much like <hi>that</hi>
of <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Ziklag;</hi> and much
Greater than <hi>that</hi> of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
at <hi>Tilbury.</hi> But <hi>now</hi> did
She demean Herself, not only as That
<hi>Queen,</hi> but as <hi>David</hi> did at that
Time, <hi>She Encouraged Herself
in the Lord Her God.</hi> And
Those who should have Animated
<hi>Her,</hi> had She <hi>need</hi> of being A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated
by them, were chiefly support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Observations they made of
the Admirable presence of Mind, She
all along shewed. Minding the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
which the Exegency of Affairs
called for, and Expressing no dissidence
of Success.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61714:15"/>
And <hi>this,</hi> no doubt, was one of
those Times, to which a Noble <hi>Earl</hi>
referred, in <hi>this</hi> Saying which I heard
from him, <hi>viz. We have owed
our Safety more than Once,
to the Queens Care and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy.</hi>
And he was at such a
<hi>Post,</hi> in all the most difficult part
of Their Majesties Reign, as to be
<hi>best</hi> Able of any Minister of State,
to say <hi>this</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> Knowledge.</p>
            <p>I cannot here Omit the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(tho' it would have better come
in before) what Another Great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
very Eminent for <hi>Piety</hi> as well
as Parts and Learning, with whom
the Queen frequently Conversed, did
say to <hi>me</hi> of Her, about <hi>Four</hi> Years
since, <hi>viz.</hi> She is so Good, that
when I Compare my self with
Her, I am Ashamed to find,
how much I fall short of Her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61714:16"/>
She was so great an Example of
Piety and every Virtue, that Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
them altogether, it can be no
<hi>Hyperbole</hi> to say, Certainly a
Greater never Graced a Throne.
She had the Virtues of the Best
Princes, without the least Mixture
of those Failings, with which the
Names of most of them are Stain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in History.</p>
            <p>As to that <hi>One</hi> (that <hi>onely)</hi>
Thing, which our <hi>Male-Contents</hi>
would fix as a foul <hi>Blot</hi> upon Her
Majesties Memory; would they once
be Perswaded to lay aside their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
and the groundless Notions
they have Entertained, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
they should not at length see,
with the Generality of their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Brethren, not only at Home,
but throughout Christendom, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61714:16"/>
That which they would make such

               </gap>n Hainous Crime in the King and
Queen, is rather an Instance of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>King,</hi> What greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
can they desire, than He
hath given them, of his not having
been Acted in what so much Offends
them, by Aspiring Ambition? For had
He been induced by so very Bad a
Principle, to take upon Him the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>these</hi> Kingdoms, Are
they able to imagine He would have
Harassed Himself, and run so many
Tremendous Hazards, as He hath
done ever since, both by Land and
Sea? Can they think it Possible for
Him to chuse <hi>such</hi> a Life, had He
Accepted of <hi>Three</hi> Crowns for the
Pleasure of <hi>Wearing</hi> them?</p>
            <p>Had <hi>this</hi> been his Ultimate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
His Haughty <hi>Neighbour</hi> had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61714:17"/>
too many Irons in the Fire, to have
given Him the least Disturbance in
the Enjoyment of His Acquisitions:
And would have Thanked Him to let
Him have owned Him for His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and to have consented to such a
League with Him, as <hi>that</hi> he made
with the Late <hi>Usurper:</hi> And would
no more have been King <hi>James</hi>'s
Friend, than he was King <hi>Charles</hi>'s,
when He fled to him for Succour;
but would have served the One as he
did the Other.</p>
            <p>Those know <hi>Nothing,</hi> of that
Prince who hath made himself so <hi>well</hi>
known to All <hi>Europe,</hi> that can make
the least <hi>doubt</hi> of this.</p>
            <p>One would think therefore, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
it self should not need to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
That King <hi>William</hi> Accepted
not of these Crowns, otherwise than
as a Means to the Noblest of Ends,

               <hi>viz.</hi> The Rescuing of both These
and the Neighbouring Nations, from
Popery, Oppression and Slavery.</p>
            <p>And would the Men I am dealing
with, have had the Queen obstruct
This Glorious Work, by Refusing to
sit with her Royal Husband upon the
English Throne, merely because That
Prince was her <hi>Father</hi> who left it
Empty? When if He could have been
satisfied, not to Subject Himself to
the <hi>Tripple Crown,</hi> and not to be
Governed by the Counsels of <hi>Jesuites,</hi>
and by the Dictates of the Greatest
Enemy we are capable of having; and
to let his People enjoy their <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Laws;</hi> He might have
Reigned as happily, notwithstanding
his being a Son of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as ever did Any of His
Royal <hi>Protestant</hi> Predecessors.</p>
            <p>Should the Queen have been so
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61714:18"/>
               <hi>Wilful,</hi> as to prefer the <hi>False</hi> Interest

               </hi> to the Interest of so many

She would have left a Blot <hi>indeed</hi>
upon Her <hi>now</hi> Spotless and most
Precious Memory.</p>
            <p>In what I have here said of Her
Majesty, Which is Extreamly <hi>little,</hi>
Considering what She deserved, I sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
Profess that I have no other
Aim, but to make us the more Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with that Sad Providence, which
hath deprived Us of Her; in Order to
our making that good improvement
thereof which God Expecteth.</p>
            <p>Had the Queens High Deserts been

High Esteem for His Royal Consort,
upon the account both of Her Wisdom
and Piety.</p>
            <p>And the King Bewails Her Death,
as an unspeakable Loss to <hi>Himself,</hi>
as well as to His <hi>People.</hi> He decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
like a good Christian, when He had
no Hope of Her Life, That <hi>He did
not Repine at the Will of God:</hi>
But yet the Thoughts of His Parting
with Her did Put Him, as Great a
Soul as He hath, into Terrible <hi>Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi>
Which were so far from being
<hi>Blame-</hi>Worthy, that they made His
<hi>Submission</hi> to That Hand, which
gave Him this Bitter Cup to drink,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61714:19"/>
the more like His Blessed Saviours.</p>
            <p>And the Queens <hi>Death</hi> was such
as it might have been Presumed, such
a <hi>Life</hi> would End in. Upon Her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the first Intimation of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
She was in, She Replyed to this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
<hi>I have been instructed by
the Divines of our Church, how
very Hazardous a thing it is to
Rely upon a Death-Bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi>
and I am not now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the Great Work of Preparing
for Death: And, I Praise God,
I am not Afraid of it.</p>
            <p>And She was so <hi>Composed</hi>
throughout Her Sickness, that 'twas
Evident She had not the least distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
upon Her Mind; but that all
was Calm and Serene within Her.
One of Her <hi>Physicians</hi> (a very Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Gentleman) was so Affected with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61714:19"/>
the Observations he then made of Her,
as since to say, <hi>She seemed to me,
more like an Angel, than a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Frequently She called for the <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
which my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
still read to Her; And about <hi>Twelve</hi>
hours before Her Departure, She Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
received the <hi>Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
at his Hands, Seven <hi>Bishops</hi>
Communicating with Her. And at
last She went away as quietly as a
Lamb, with <hi>Her Works following
Her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! What a Dark, What a Black
<hi>Christmas</hi> hath <hi>this</hi> Year brought
us! We may well apply thereto <hi>those</hi>
Words in the Prophesy of <hi>Amos, It
shall come to Pass, saith the Lord,
that I will cause the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to go
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61714:20"/>
down at Noon-Day,</hi> (and it was
scarce Noon-day, with This our Bright
Sun, when it sett) <hi>and I will turn
your Feasts into Mourning, and
all your Songs into Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, if my Grief could Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me farther to Aggravate this our
Loss, after the Faithful Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as defective as it is, which hath
been given of the Worth of the <hi>Jewel</hi>
we have lost, it would not signifie
much to you: since the Loss is such,
as that you can <hi>Conceive,</hi> much
better than I can <hi>Express</hi> the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it. And if it be not Year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Year more and more Felt, and
therefore better Understood, it will
be what we have as little reason as
can be, to expect.</p>
            <p>And nothing but wretched Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61714:20"/>
can make us Fearless of its
being designed for a Presage and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
of other Calamities; while we
continue so Bad a People, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Great Blessings, both
Spiritual and Temporal, which our
Nation hath had a long Enjoyment
of, above all other Parts of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom:</hi>
And while most Countries
about us have lain under Oppression
and Tyranny, and been in Blood and
Confusion: And notwithstanding our
late most wonderful Deliverance, and
the strange and unexpected Things
which God hath since done for us,
towards the Securing and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
thereof.</p>
            <p>The most serious People are much
afraid, That Her Majesty <hi>is taken
away from the Evil to come,</hi>
when they Reflect upon the High
Provocation, we have given to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61714:21"/>
               <hi>Divine</hi> Majesty, by our Obstinate
Aversion to the least Reformation,
either of Manners, or of any thing
Amiss, after all the Marvellous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpositions
of Providence, in the
Behalf both of our Church and State.</p>
            <p>God saw Her to be incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
too Good for a People, who would
not Mend in the least by Her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
And therefore what can we
reasonably think, but that He took
Her hence in just Iudgment to <hi>Us,</hi>
tho' in infinite Mercy to <hi>Herself.</hi>
At least, this sad Conclusion may be
made from this Providence, if we
should be as insensible of the Hand
of God in our Loss of Her, as we
have been of the Blessing we had
in Her, while we enjoyed Her. And
Her Kingdoms might have enjoyed
Her more than <hi>Forty</hi> Years longer,
had they better deserved Her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:61714:21"/>
Had Her Life been prolonged to
<hi>such</hi> a Number of Years, it would
have been no strange thing, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Her Temperance, and the
Healthfulness and Strength of Her
Constitution.</p>
            <p>We can assign no mere Natural
Reason, Why She might not at <hi>least</hi>
have lived to the Age of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who dyed before She was
<hi>Seventy</hi> Years Old, and yet was
<hi>Thirty Eight</hi> Years Elder than our
Blessed Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if it should prove, That this
sad stroke should be <hi>lost</hi> upon us,
what Cause may we have to dread,
a yet <hi>Sadder!</hi> I mean the losing of
our <hi>King</hi> too, who may well be
called, <hi>The very Breath of our
Nostrils,</hi> since the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
did so stile a Prince, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
not to be Named on the same
day with <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:61714:22"/>
And <hi>well</hi> may I say, that the
Loss of King <hi>William,</hi> would be
the Greatest, that (Humanly speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
can befal us: Since those are
worse than Blind, who will not see,
That the Safety of these Nations,
and of at least all our <hi>Protestant</hi>
Neighbours, doth wholly, under God
Almighty, depend upon His Precious
Life; and must necessarily so do in
the Eye of Reason, while our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
continue as they are <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should God call the King from us,
before our Danger from <hi>France</hi> is O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
I can not think but the Faces of
many of his Professed <hi>Enemies</hi> would
soon gather Blackness, at the Scaring
Prospect which those who can see but
one <hi>Inch</hi> before them, must needs <hi>then</hi>
have a Clear sight of. And then it may
Endanger their Losing that Sense they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61714:22"/>
have <hi>left</hi> them, to Reflect upon their
Prodigious insensibility of their <hi>own</hi>
interest, whether they Ever Come or
no, to have any Concernment for the
<hi>Publick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what Cause have we to Pray
Heartily for the Kings Long and
Prosperous Reign Over us, from Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to <hi>Him</hi> as well as to <hi>Our
Selves!</hi> Since to <hi>Him,</hi> as Gods
great Instrument, We Owe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of our Religion, and of all
that is Dear to us!</p>
            <p>To Conclude, Those who are so Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious
as to look no farther, than the
Natural Cause of the Queens Death,
are never like to be Bettered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
But Such as are duly Sensible
of Gods Hand therein; who could
easily have Prevented it without a
Miracle, and by his Ordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61714:23"/>
too, had He seen it in His
infinite Wisdom Fit; Can not but
See what an Awakening Providence
This is, Loudly Calling upon us to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone
His Wrath, by deep Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Hearty Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p>But let the Consequents of this
Stroke be <hi>never</hi> so Sad, we ought,
with Holy King <hi>David, To be
dumb, and not open our Mouths,
because it was Gods doing:</hi> And

and not onely his Patient Submission
to, but also Thankful Acquiescence
in the Will of God, under the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest
of Calamities, she brake out into
these most Impious and Blasphemous
Words, as they are in our <hi>Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Dost thou still retein thine Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity?
Curse God and dye.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

Good at the Hand of God, and
shall we not receive Evil?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That speech of hers is variously
rendred, but I shall onely Observe,
that the Hebrew Word which is here
Translated <hi>Curse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>properly</hi> signifies the

so renders it in this Place; but
I acknowledge so it doth too, in that
saying of the <hi>Devil, He will Curse
Thee to Thy face;</hi> where the same
Word is used, but our Translation
<hi>there</hi> must needs be right.</p>
            <p>But I have thought it strange, that the
<hi>Septuagint</hi> should render this Speech
of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Wife,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>Blapheme God and dye;</hi>
where the Word may very well sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<hi>Bless;</hi> and yet render that other
of the <hi>Devil,</hi>

               <hi>He will Bless Thee to
thy face;</hi> where 'tis manifest it must
signifie <hi>Curse;</hi> as it does in some few
other Texts.</p>
            <p>In short, I see no reason why we
should not (with some of our most
Learned Expositors) understand this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61714:25"/>
Word <hi>here</hi> according to its <hi>Proper</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification;
and so make <hi>Iob</hi>'s Wife to
say to him, <hi>Bless God and dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may Object, Why then should
these Words so strike <hi>Iob</hi> to the heart,
as his Reply shews they did, <hi>viz. Thou
speakest as one of the foolish Women
speaketh;</hi> that is, Thou speakest like
a <hi>Wicked Wretch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answer, That 'tis too evident
these Words were spoken</hi> Tauntingly,
<hi>and therefore well deserved so severe
a Rebuke: They may be thus Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras'd:</hi>
I see thou art a wonderful
Thankful Man: Thou canst bless God,
when of a vastly Rich Man, He makes
thee a Beggar; when of a Father, of
no fewer than Ten Children, He makes
thee Childless in a Moment: Go on to
Bless Him still, since thou hast so great
Encouragement; the Reward He designs
thee being the destroying of thee, next
after thy Children.</p>
            <p>And this saying, <hi>Bless God and dye,</hi>
used as a <hi>Taunt,</hi> I need not tell you
was highly daring and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
tho' not so Horribly Profane as
<hi>Curse God and dye.</hi>

no <hi>better</hi> Men of <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
tho' none did more Profess the

            <p>But we will a little Enquire, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Evil</hi> things do come also from
God's Hand; because those who have
the Highest Thoughts of the Divine
Goodness, may be most apt to Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
how God can be the Author of
any Evil; How out of the same Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
can Flow, both Sweet Streams
and Bitter; Or rather, How Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
can issue forth from the Fountain
of Sweetness.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>this</hi> is very Accountable,
will chiefly appear from what we are
to say <hi>hereafter.</hi> Our present Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is to shew, That Evils <hi>do</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the Hand of God; as also
<hi>what</hi> Hand He hath in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they</hi> do <hi>proceed from His
Hand, is so evident from the Holy
Scriptures, that nothing is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
God Almighty saith by His
Prophet</hi> Isaiah, Ch. 45. 7. I form the
Light, and create Darkness; I make
Peace, and create Evil: I the Lord
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61714:27"/>
do all these things. <hi>And by His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
Amos, <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. 6. Shall there be
Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not
done it? <hi>And by His Servant</hi> Moses,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 39. See now, that I even I
am He, and there is no God with me;
I kill and I make alive, I wound and
I heal; neither is there any that can
deliver out of my Hand. <hi>And all the</hi>
Threatnings <hi>in the Book of God do
suppose</hi> this.</p>
            <p>And therefore we there find Good
Men, still acknowledging God's Hand
in their Afflictions. Thus Upright
<hi>Iob,</hi> upon his receiving the Tydings
of his Prodigious Losses, saith, <hi>The
Lord hath given, and the Lord hath
taken away,</hi> &amp;c. Ch. 1. 21. The Lord
hath <hi>taken away,</hi> as well as <hi>given.</hi>
King <hi>David</hi> we find frequently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
such Acknowledgments. And
our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> calls his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<hi>The Cup which his Father had
given him to drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed the <hi>Pagans</hi> had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
this sense of the Evils (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Greater) that befell them,
as well as of their Good Things:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61714:27"/>
And therefore they had their <hi>Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi>
and many Expiatory Rites, for
the Pacifying of their Gods, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Calamities of any kind did
light upon them.</p>
            <p>Now in order to our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>What</hi> Hand God hath in Evils,
we are to take Notice.</p>
            <p>1. That they do not ordinarily
proceed <hi>immediately</hi> from His Hand:
Nay we have no reason to believe
that any Evils ever do, but 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that those do proceed from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible</hi>
second Causes, which do not
from <hi>Visible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Nor is it necessary to make E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
at least <hi>Ordinarily,</hi> the Effects
of Second Causes, by any <hi>positive</hi>
Act of God, whereby he useth those
Causes as his <hi>Instruments</hi> in the most
proper and strict sence of that Word.
But it may be enough to say, upon
the falling out of Disasters, that His
good Providence did not interpose,
in preventing those Evil Effects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
produced by their Causes. Nor
can we certainly conclude, that ever
God doth any more than withhold
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61714:28"/>
his wonted Protection in such Cases.</p>
            <p>3. Evils may be truly of God's <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing,</hi>
tho not caused by any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Act of His. And whensoever
His Providence suffers us to fall into
such Circumstances, as that certain
Evils inevitably light upon us, and
no Care could prevent them; then,
at least, we may look upon them as
being of the Divine Appointment, no
less than Permission.</p>
            <p>And even those may be so, which
are the Effects of other Peoples <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</hi>
As when the Pride, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,
or Malice of another makes
me a Sufferer. For the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Advantages which a wicked
Man may at any time have against
me, are from the Divine Providence.
So that, tho' it be infinitely unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of God, to infuse Evil Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Inclinations or Dispositions into
any man, or to excite any one to
<hi>Sin,</hi> yet He knowing such Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Inclinations to be in such
Persons, and that they only want
Objects or Opportunities for the <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of them, He may make use of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61714:28"/>
them, for the scourging of such Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Sinners, or for the Tryal of
such or such of His Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have an Instance hereof in</hi> Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei'<hi>s</hi>
Cursing King <hi>David. Upon</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishai'<hi>s
saying,</hi> Why should this dead
Dog Curse my Lord the King? Let me
I pray thee go over, and take off his
Head: <hi>The King thus Reply'd,</hi> Let
him Curse, because the Lord hath said
unto him, Curse <hi>David;</hi> who shall then
say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> could not mean by these
Words,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 9.</note> that God had laid His <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
upon that Wretch to Curse
him; This would have been to make
him no Sinner herein, but His Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
Servant. But his Meaning was,
That God had by his Providence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Shimei</hi> this Opportunity of insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over him, and venting his Spite
upon him. And therefore the good
King concluded that God in just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
did not scourge him with the
Tongue of <hi>Shimei,</hi> as He had done by
the Sword of his Son <hi>Absalom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus God calls the <hi>Assyrian,
The Rod of his Anger,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 10. 5, 6.</note> and saith that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61714:29"/>
               <hi>He will send him against an Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Nation.</hi> And by this Phrase,
we are to understand, God's so Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, as that all Difficulties and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
should be removed out
of his way to the invading of the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites;</hi>
which He knew he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
in mind to do, as soon as he
could have an Opportunity. Nor
are we to think it strange that such
Words, as <hi>Sending, Commanding, Doing,
Determining,</hi> and many other like
them, should be used onely to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
either <hi>removing Rubs out of the
way to certain Evils,</hi> (whether Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or Moral) or <hi>bare Permissions;</hi>
since these ways of Speaking are <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Idioms,</hi> and as ordinary as can
be in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Language: Of which
there are innumerable Instances in
<hi>Holy Scripture:</hi> I will Name one
more, <hi>viz.</hi> that in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 28. where
God's <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
are said to be in the Horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Death and Sufferings of <hi>His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Child Iesus.</hi> But 'tis as evident as
that 'tis impossible for God to be the
<hi>Author of Sin,</hi> that those Phrases sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61714:29"/>
no more than His <hi>Permitting,</hi>
or <hi>Decreeing</hi> to permit those Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to be inflicted by His Enemies,
and His so Ordering it in His Wise
Providence, as that all Impediments
to the Executing of their Malice,
should be removed.</p>
            <p>And we may well say, that God's
Hand is in the Evils which befal Men,
tho' there should be no positive Act
of His Hand in them, since the Evils
of which <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>Shall we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them at the Hand of God?</hi> Were
all inflicted by the Hand of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi>
through <hi>His</hi> Permission. All his
Heavy Calamities were the Effects
of Satan's Malice, and consequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God's not restreining him from
venting it as he did.</p>
            <p>It appears by the Story, that it
was the <hi>Devil</hi> who stirred up the
<hi>Sabeans</hi> and others to Rob him of his
Cattle, and to destroy his Servants:
That it was the <hi>Devil</hi> that brought
down the Fire on the remainder of
them, altho' it be called the <hi>Fire of
God from Heaven:</hi> That it was the
<hi>Devil</hi> who raised the Storm, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61714:30"/>
blew down the House upon his Sons
and Daughters: That it was <hi>He</hi> who
filled his Body with Blains &amp; Botch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
And these Terrible Evils were not
onely <hi>Permitted</hi> by God, but <hi>Appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
too, but His Appointment took
place through His mere Permission:
As knowing that Satan was enough
his Enemy, to bring all these Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
upon him, and worse too, if
He would but suffer him. There is no
more than <hi>Permission,</hi> or <hi>not hindering</hi>
to be understood in that Saying of
the Divine Majesty to him, <hi>Behold
all that he hath is in thy Power,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 12. Or in <hi>that, Behold he
is in thine Hand,</hi> &amp;c. Chap. 2. 6. Not
that God gave him a <hi>Commission,</hi> or so
much as <hi>Leave</hi> (or Licence) thus to
Torment the Upright Man; He one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
withdrew the Restreints he was
before under, from thus Worrying
him. This is evident from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
which the Devil himself gives
of his having hitherto spared him,
Chap. 1. 10. <hi>Hast thou not,</hi> saith he,
<hi>made an Hedge about him, and about
his house, and about all that he hath on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61714:30"/>
every side?</hi> And whereas he saith in
the next Verse, <hi>But put forth thine
Hand now, and touch all that he hath,
and he will Curse thee to thy Face:</hi>
It is plain, he meant no more by these
Words, but <hi>Cease to protect him from
my hand:</hi> And in so Expressing this
his Meaning, he complyed with the
fore-mentioned <hi>Hebrew Idiom,</hi> or
<hi>Manner of Speaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we proceed further, Let us
stop a while to take Notice, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
we are obliged to the Divine
Protection; in that we find not our
present State, far more Sad and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous
than it is. Many Afflictions
we meet with in this World, and
sometimes very Heavy ones: But for
<hi>One</hi> Exercise of our Patience, we should
have a <hi>Thousand,</hi> and those much more
intolerable than we have ever yet felt,
did not the good Providence of God
continually guard us; were not <hi>The
Lord of Hosts with us;</hi> were not <hi>The
God of Iacob our Defence and Refuge:</hi>
There are not a few things in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which would be both Mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61714:31"/>
and Destructive to us, but for
the Care which God Almighty takes
of us, by the Ministry of His <hi>Angels,</hi>
and very many other invisible Ways<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
We know, both by Observation and
Experience, that there is no Creature
so inconsiderable, as not to be able
to make us Miserable, with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Permission, or to put a Period
to our Lives. And therefore that
was a good Reply, which <hi>Theodorus</hi>
made to <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> when he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Kill him,</hi> viz. <hi>What a mighty
Matter is that, the most contemptible
things is as able to do this as thy self.</hi>
The ill <hi>Accidents</hi> to which we are
dayly liable, are innumerable; and
so are the Natural Causes, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us and within us, of a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Diseases;</hi> so that if they were
not over-ruled by Providence (and
that by such secret Means as make
it impossible for us to understand <hi>how)</hi>
we could never have one hours free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from Sickness, or Pain; and
should be always running into Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Devils</hi> were our onely Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61714:31"/>
who are still watching all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
against both our Souls and
Bodies, were it not for the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
the Case of <hi>both</hi> would be
most deplorable. St. <hi>Peter</hi> compares
the <hi>Head</hi> of them to <hi>A Roaring Lyon,</hi>
and saith, that <hi>he walketh about seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whom he may devour.</hi> Of these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Spirits, and their Malevolence
to Mankind, the <hi>Pagans</hi> had an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Tradition, &amp; the poor <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
especially need no such Tradition,
to whom, to this day, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Visible, and make them feel sad
Effects of their Malice. And we find
enough in the History of the Gospel,
to incline us to think it very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that many of the <hi>Diseases,</hi> and
other Evils which happen to <hi>us,</hi> are
of <hi>their</hi> Procurement. And there
needs no more, but God's saying to
any one of <hi>them,</hi> concerning any of
<hi>us,</hi> what he said of <hi>Iob, Behold they
are in thine hand,</hi> to make this Life
a very <hi>hell</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>I say therefore, how unspeakably
are we obliged to our Good God, for
protecting us, as He doth, with His
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61714:32"/>
Watchful Eye, and Almighty Arm!
We have seen that He needs not <hi>do</hi>
any thing, nor Exert <hi>His</hi> Power in
any one <hi>Act,</hi> to make our Being in
this World most miserable. He needs,
in Order thereto, onely not to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
His Care of us; which the Bad
as well as Good, and those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
Him every day, such is His
Goodness and Long-suffering, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Moment protected by; though
not <hi>alike</hi> protected; nor the same
Persons <hi>alwaies</hi> alike. And how fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
should we be of disobliging such
a Friend, lest we at length provoke
Him to pluck up His <hi>Hedge</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We come next to shew,
<hi>What is meant by</hi> Receiving Evil <hi>at
the Hand of God;</hi> which <hi>Iob</hi>'s Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
here speaks to be a most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Duty.—<hi>Shall we not receive
Evil?</hi> This implyeth these <hi>Four</hi>
Things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Heartily Acknowledging the Hand
of God, to be in the Evils that befal
us.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61714:32"/>
2. Submitting Patiently to His Will
under them.</item>
               <item>3. Doing this also, Thankfully.</item>
               <item>4. Complying with God'<hi>s</hi> Great End
and Design, in them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, <hi>Heartily Acknowledging the
Hand, or Providence of God, to be in
the Evils which befal us.</hi> Since God's
Hand <hi>is,</hi> as hath been shewed, in them,
we must needs be obliged to receive
them as from <hi>Him;</hi> and with a great
sense of the Truth of that Saying of
<hi>Eliphaz, Affliction cometh not forth of
the Dust, neither doth Trouble spring
out of the Ground:</hi> Or it is not to be
ascribed merely to Earthly or Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Causes. And therefore, as we have
observed, we find Pious Men in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
still owning God's Providence in
their Afflictions.</p>
            <p>Those consequently, who look no
farther than the <hi>immediate</hi> Causes of
them, or who look not beyond those
which are <hi>Visible,</hi> cannot behave
themselves like <hi>Religious</hi> Men under
them, nor scarely like <hi>Men:</hi> But do
too often resemble those silly <hi>Currs,</hi>
that fly furiously upon the Stones
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61714:33"/>
which are flung at them, taking no
Notice of the Hand from whence
they come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Those</hi> must either not believe that
God takes care of Men, and deny that
there is any such thing as Providence,
(which is as bad as slat <hi>Atheism,</hi> if
it be ever separated from it) who,
when, for instance, they are visited
with <hi>Sickness,</hi> think of no higher Cause
thereof, than the noxious quality or
quantity of what they have eaten or
drank, or infectious Steams, or bad
Air, or the like; and never consider,
that none of these things could hurt
them, had not God seen it good, not
to keep them by some Providence or
other out of Harms way, or not to
Over-rule such Causes. And the like
may be said of <hi>those,</hi> who, upon the
Death of a dear Relative or Friend,
are aware of no other Cause thereof,
than the Nature of the Disease, or the
Weakness of the Means which were
used for the Cure thereof, or some ill
Accident, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it never enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their thoughts, that this Person
would have Recovered, had God seen
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61714:33"/>
it fit to prolong his or her Life:
Which if He <hi>had,</hi> more effectual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
would have been applyed, or
Success given to more ineffectual:
Or, in a word, God would then have
raised up the Patient by some Means
or other, innumerable of which He
hath at His Command; or have done
it, if He had pleased, <hi>without</hi> Means.</p>
            <p>He who suffers from the Hand of
<hi>Malice,</hi> doth not suffer like a Pious
Man, who looks not upon His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
as God's Rod; who considers not,
that as much <hi>ill Will</hi> as he hath, he
<hi>could have no Power against him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it were given him from Above;</hi>
as our Blessed Saviour said to <hi>Pilate.</hi>
And so we might proceed in other
Instances.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Receiving Evils at God's
Hand implyeth also,</hi> Submiting pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
and quietly to His Will under
them. <hi>Patient submission under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
is expressed by</hi> Accepting
them, <hi>which is the same with</hi> Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them. If their Vncircumcised
Heart be humbled, and they Accept of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61714:34"/>
the Punishment of their Iniquity, <hi>&amp;c.
Lev.</hi> 26. 41. And they shall Accept of
the Punishment of their Iniquity, <hi>v.</hi> 43.</p>
            <p>We had as good, not to Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Hand of God in our Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as not to submit to His Hand.
Nay, in <hi>this</hi> respect it is <hi>worse,</hi> to
Murmur and Repine at them, while
we acknowledge a Divine Providence
in them, than to have no belief here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Repining at any thing
which we believe <hi>God</hi> hath an Hand
in, is <hi>Charging Him foolishly.</hi> 'Tis at
least, a <hi>Tacit</hi> and <hi>Virtual</hi> Accusing
God Almighty of Injustice, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness,
or want of Wisdom.</p>
            <p>Impatience under God's Hand must
necessarily proceed from some false
and unworthy Notion of Him; nor
can we grudge at any Dispensation
of His Providence, while we have a
Sense of <hi>this,</hi> That God can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what is most <hi>fit</hi> to be done.
Now it is nothing so great a Reflexion
upon the Divine Honour, to deny that
God concerneth Himself in our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
as, acknowledging it, to think
that He can do what is <hi>Vnworthy</hi> of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61714:34"/>
Himself, and can be Cruel or Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in any of them: Or can at any
time Act unlike to an Absolutely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Being. Nay <hi>Plutarch</hi> would tell
us, that it casts less Dishonour upon
God, to deny His very <hi>Being,</hi> than to
conceive such a thing as <hi>this</hi> of Him:
For He saith, <hi>That he had rather the
World should hereafter say there was
never such a Man as</hi> Plutarch, <hi>than that</hi>
Plutarch <hi>was an Vnjust and Naughty
Man.</hi> And I am sure, every Good
Man will be of <hi>his</hi> Mind.</p>
            <p>So that there is no Duty more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
and therefore more indispens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
than <hi>quiet Submission</hi> under the
Severest of Providences; which doth
always imply a Sense of their being
Good, as Severe as they may <hi>seem</hi>
to be; and no less Good <hi>really,</hi> than
they are Severe <hi>seemingly</hi> and in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>And therefore, where as we have
observed, that we still find good men
<hi>Acknowledging</hi> the Hand of God in
their Sufferings, so we have them as
constantly expressing their <hi>Submission</hi>
thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61714:35"/>
               <hi>Iob</hi> was a most Admirable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Patience, considering what a
prodigious Sufferer he was; tho' in
the <hi>last</hi> of his terrible Tryals, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
too much weakness.</p>
            <p>Old <hi>Ely,</hi> when the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi>
had told him the Dreadful Things,
which God had threatned against his
House, immediately expressed his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
in these Words, <hi>It is the Lord,
let Him do what seemeth Him good,</hi>
1 Sam. 3. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King</hi> David <hi>under a very sore Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
which he called the</hi> Stroke
<hi>and the</hi> Blow of God'<hi>s</hi> Hand, <hi>thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed</hi>
his <hi>Submission;</hi> I was dumb, I
opened not my Mouth, because Thou didst
it, <hi>Psal. 39. 9. And there is another
very Remarkable and Affecting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
given by him hereof, when he
was not onely forced to flee from</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
<hi>but in Eminent Danger of
losing his Kingdom, by reason of the
Powerful Conspiracy of His own</hi> Son
<hi>against Him.</hi> If, saith <hi>He,</hi> I shall find
favour in the eyes of the Lord, He will
bring me again, and shew me both the
Ark of God and his Habitation: But
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61714:35"/>
if He thus saith, I have no Delight
in thee, Behold here am I, let Him do
what seemeth good unto Him, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi>
15. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as, all things considered, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was there such a Sufferer as our
Blessed</hi> Lord, <hi>so never was there a
Pattern of</hi> Patience and Submission,
<hi>comparable to that which</hi> He <hi>hath
set us. Never were worse Words heard
from Him, than such as</hi> these: If this
Cup may not pass from me, except I
drink it, Thy Will be done. Not my
Will, but Thy Will be done. The Cup
which my Father hath given me to
drink, shall I not drink it? <hi>And His
Example is again and again proposed
to us, as a great Motive to</hi> Patience,
<hi>and the resigning of our selves to the
Divine Will under all Afflicting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences,</hi>
Let us, <hi>saith the Author
to the</hi> Hebrews, run the Race that
is set before us with Patience, looking
unto Iesus the Author and Finisher of
our Faith; who, for the joy that was
set before Him, endured the Cross, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
the Shame, <hi>&amp;c. Chap.</hi> 12. 1, 2.
For consider Him, who endured such
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61714:36"/>
contradiction of Sinners against Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
lest ye be wearyed and faint in
your Minds, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. And for as much,
<hi>saith the Apostle St.</hi> Peter, as Christ
hath suffered for us in the Flesh, Arm
your selves also with the same Mind,
1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>In</hi> Receiving Evil at Gods
Hand, <hi>is likewise implyed</hi> Thankful,
<hi>as well as Patient</hi> Submission. <hi>It is
evident, that</hi> Iob <hi>intended</hi> this <hi>too,
in saying,</hi> Shall we not receive Evil?
<hi>Seeing his</hi> Wifes <hi>upbraiding him with
his</hi> Blessing God <hi>in these words,</hi> The
Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken
away, and blessed be the Name of the
Lord, <hi>did occasion that Reply to her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor are we to think, that <hi>this his
Blessing of God,</hi> upon his receiving
such Woful Tydings, was <hi>more</hi> than
his Duty; as greatly honoured as he
hath most deservedly been in all Ages
for it: For 'tis as highly Reasonable,
that We should receive Evils <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi>
as that we should be <hi>Submissive</hi>
under them; tho' it is more difficult.</p>
            <p>Not that an Affliction as <hi>such</hi> is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61714:36"/>
matter of Thankfulness; but it is
so, Considered as designed by God
for our Good, our greatest Good; as
will hereafter be shewed.</p>
            <p>Good People find it a very Easie
thing, to thank God heartily for Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
after the Smart of them is
over, upon their Experimenting Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to their Souls by them: But
there is the same Reason to Thank
God for His <hi>designing</hi> us Good, that
there is for our <hi>actual receiving</hi> it. I
have every whit as much reason, when
I am Sick or in Pain, or when I see
one so who is <hi>dear</hi> to me, or when
I have <hi>lost</hi> such a one; to Praise God
for intending such Sufferings for my
Spiritual Advantage, as I have so to
do, after I have found this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by them.</p>
            <p>No Man can doubt, but that <hi>Iob</hi>
was Obliged to be Thankful for his
Afflictions (as Heavy as they were)
<hi>after</hi> he was raised to much more Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and Happy Circumstances by the
means of them; and therefore it is
Evident that it became him so to be,
while he continued under the weight
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61714:37"/>
of them. Because the Notion he had
of God assured him, that he Meant
great good to him by them; Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in <hi>this</hi> World, but Certainly in
that to <hi>come;</hi> which is far better.</p>
            <p>All Afflictions as <hi>such</hi> are Evils, as
<hi>Iob</hi> calls them, and therefore it would
be Harsh Doctrine to say, that we
ought to Bless God for them Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
under that Notion; but it
Sounds no more Harshly to say, that
we are bound to be heartily Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for them, as they are Means of
Grace, and Divine Methods for the
more and more qualifying us for the
Heavenly Happiness, than it doth to
tell me, That my <hi>Surgeon</hi> deserves
not only Thanks but a Reward too,
for the Torment he gives me, as that
Torment is designed in order to my
<hi>Cure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Considering Afflictions under the
notion of Medicines for the Curing
of our Spiritual Maladies, or as Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
for the Exercise of our Graces,
they are not onely Good, but some
of the Best things; but I shall not
need to say, that all Good things are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61714:37"/>
matter of Thanksgiving; nor that
our Thankfulness for them ought to
be proportioned to the <hi>degrees</hi> of
Goodness that are in them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is implyed too in</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Evils at Gods Hand; <hi>that we</hi>
Chearfully Comply with Gods Ends and
Designs in inflicting them.</p>
            <p>We now intimated that they are
designed for Good to us, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of our Endeavours with the
Divine Grace, is absolutely necessary
to the accomplishing of Gods good
Designs upon us. No Means of Grace
can signify any good to us, without
our making use of them as <hi>Such.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We said <hi>but now,</hi> That Patient
Submission is Expressed by <hi>Accepting
the Punishment of our iniquities;</hi> and
now we add that <hi>Compliance</hi> also with
the Ends thereof, the Chief of which
is our Reformation, was intended by
that Form of speech. Nor can we
be properly said to <hi>Receive</hi> Evil from
God, or to Accept thereof, if we are
meerly Passive under it; or at least we
then <hi>receive it in vain,</hi> as the Apostle
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61714:38"/>
beseecheth us not so <hi>to receive the
Grace of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to improve Afflictions to our
Spiritual Advantage, seeing <hi>this</hi> is
the Design of them, is to <hi>despise</hi> them;
which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> warned <hi>Iob</hi> against.
<hi>Happy is the man,</hi> saith he, <hi>whom God
Correcteth, therefore despise not thou
the Chastening of the Lord, Iob</hi> 5. 17.
Which is as much as if he had said,
Seeing God doth mean the greatest
Good to Men in Correcting them,
be sure thou so improve this His Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Correction; as not to frustrate
His End therein. And Excellent was
that Advice which <hi>Elihu</hi> gave him,
Ch. 34. 31, 32. <hi>Surely it is meet to
be said unto God I have born Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I will not offend any more; That
which I see not teach Thou me; if I
have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some may think, that we have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
one Great thing, in Shewing
what is implyed in <hi>Receiving Evils at
Gods</hi> Hand, and that is Rejoycing and
Glorying in them; which is more
than being Thankful: For there are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61714:38"/>
several Texts in the <hi>New Testament,</hi>
which speak <hi>this</hi> likewise to be a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
As particularly St. <hi>Iames</hi> saith,
Ch. 1. 2. <hi>Count it all Ioy, when you
fall into diverse Temptations,</hi> or Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>We Glory in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations,</hi>
Rom. 5. 3. And <hi>I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Glory in mine Infirmities,</hi> 2 Cor.
12. 9. And other passages there are
to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>But in Answer hereunto, such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
doubtless have not reference
to those Afflictions, which God lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon us in the Ordinary Course
of His Providence, but to those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
which Christians meet with,
for the Testimony of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and for Righteousness Sake;
which were the Chief sufferings of the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
And the Apostle doth plainly
intimate, in the words next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those I last cited, that <hi>this</hi> sort
of Afflictions were those he there
meant, <hi>viz. Therefore I take Pleasure
in Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
in Persecutions, in Distresses,
for Christ's Sake.</hi> Or in Suffering
all these for <hi>Christ's Sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61714:39"/>
               <hi>And those words of our</hi> Saviour
<hi>may well lead us,</hi> thus <hi>to understand
the forementioned and the like Texts,</hi>
viz. Blessed are ye, when Men shall
hate you, and when they shall Separate
you from their Company, and shall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
you, and Cast out your Name
as Evil, for the Son of Man's Sake.
Rejoyce ye in that day and Leap for
joy: For behold your Reward is great
in Heaven; For in the like manner
did their Fathers unto the Prophets.
<hi>Luke 6. 22, 23. And there are</hi> three
<hi>Special Reasons, why Afflictions that
are Suffered upon</hi> this <hi>account, should
be Rejoyced and Gloried in. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Because infinite Honour is done
us, when we are called forth to Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for the Sake of Christ. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is said, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41. That <hi>The
Apostles departed from the presence of
the Council, Rejoycing that they were
accounted worthy to Suffer for His
Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Because such Sufferings have the
most Glorious Reward Promised to
them. Which you now saw is the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61714:39"/>
Reason, which our <hi>Saviour</hi> gives, why
such Sufferers should <hi>Leap for joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Because a Great Reward doth
likewise <hi>accompany</hi> Such Sufferings,
<hi>viz.</hi> A mighty Presence of Gods
Spirit, whereby the Sufferers are
<hi>Strengthned with Might in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Man.</hi> And this was the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the Apostle gave, why he <hi>would
most gladly Glory in his Infirmities;</hi>
for it follows, <hi>That the Power of Christ
may rest upon me:</hi> And why <hi>he took
Pleasure in Reproaches, in Necessities,
in Persecutions, in Distresses for Christs
Sake,</hi> viz. Because, <hi>When I am Weak
then am I Strong.</hi> Or then do I
find Great Strength from Above,
when my Sufferings do most Exceed
my natural Strength. Again, St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
saith, <hi>If ye be Reproached for the
Name of Christ, happy are ye; for the
Spirit of Glory, and of God, resteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you.</hi> So that Glorying in Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
in <hi>such</hi> Tribulations, is, if
we make Comparisons, rather a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
than a Duty.</p>
            <p>As it is a very dangerous thing,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61714:40"/>
to make Christianity an <hi>Easier</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
than Christ hath made it, so
is it to make it a <hi>Harder</hi> too: For
<hi>this</hi> tends greatly to the Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of men, and the frighting them
away from it. But nothing could
more incline us to think it an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practical
Religion, than to be told
that one of its Precepts is, That we
must Rejoyce, Triumph and Glory
under whatsoever Afflictions we are
Exercised with. So that, when I am
Tormented with a Disease, when I
have lost a most dear Relative or
Friend, or see such a one in Misery;
When a Great <hi>Publick Blessing</hi>
(such a one as That which we are
<hi>now</hi> Lamenting) is taken away from
us, it is not Enough to submit qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
to the Hand of God, nor to Thank
Him for His good and gracious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
in such fore Tryals, towards
those who shall duly improve them,
but I must also Rejoyce and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in them; or I cannot Suffer like
a <hi>Christian:</hi> This in Truth is much
too Severe Doctrin. We must needs
say of it, what the <hi>Disciples</hi> said
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61714:40"/>
in another Case, <hi>This is an hard say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who can hear it?</hi> If <hi>this</hi> were
One of the Duties (as it is not) to
which Christianity does oblige us,
we could not affirm that there is no
ground for this saying of <hi>Trypho</hi> the
<hi>Iew</hi> to <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> viz. <hi>Those Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of yours, which are conteined in
the Book which you call the Gospel, are
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, So Great and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
that I suspect no Mortal can
observe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think it here sit to suggest <hi>this</hi>
also, That neither are we obliged to
behave our selves under Afflictions,
as if we had no <hi>Sense</hi> of Pain. This is
to suffer like <hi>Stoicks,</hi> not like <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
Afflictions are painful things;
<hi>They are not for the present</hi> (as the
Apostle saith) <hi>joyous but grievous;</hi>
and if they were not <hi>Grievous</hi> they
would not be <hi>Afflictions.</hi> And when
a man is in pain, to carry it as if
he felt nothing, is so far from being
Brave, or so much as Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that it is to play the Hypocrite.
Our <hi>Saviour</hi> never taught us such
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61714:41"/>
Doctrin, as not by Precept, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by His Example; since He Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
expressed a sharp Sense of Pain.
And so Tender was his Nature, that
when He saw others weep for His
dead Friend <hi>Lazarus,</hi> He could not
forbear weeping with them, altho'
He intended presently to restore him
to Life.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Blame-worthy in <hi>Us,</hi> that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
us to shed tears, and to use
other Natural Expressions of Grief
under Afflictions; and as they are
greater or less, to express more or
less Sense of them. Onely we must
do all that lies in us not to be <hi>immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi>
Mourners: That is, we ought
not to give way to so great a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of Spirit, as will disable us
for those Duties which an Afflicted
State calleth for.</p>
            <p>And as to <hi>Weeping,</hi> I would be
so far from Checking an Afflicted
Person for it, that I would Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him to it, if he <hi>can</hi> weep. For
Experience tells us, that Tears give
a Vent to Grief, and so give some
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61714:41"/>
               <hi>Ease.</hi> But yet we may weep too
much, for Excessive Weeping raiseth
Vapours, and as much disturbs the
Head, as Moderate does relieve the
Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus much for our Second
Head of Discourse:</hi> What is here
meant by Receiving Evil at God's Hand?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>We shall now shew,</hi> How
Receiving Good at the Hand of God, is
a Motive to Receive Evil: <hi>Or,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
lyeth the Force of this Motive.</p>
            <p>The Force thereof lies in these
<hi>Four</hi> Particulars; which singly, and
much more Altogether, do make it
very Strong and Powerful.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>I.</hi> The Evils we Receive at God's
Hand, are exceeding <hi>Few</hi> in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the Good Things.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>II.</hi> Our Good Things are all <hi>Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,</hi>
even the least of them; but
we deserve incomparably more Evil
Things than we meet with in this world,
and incomparably Worse Things.</item>
               <item>III. <hi>We</hi> Need <hi>Evil Things as well
as, and</hi> no less <hi>than, Good Things.</hi>
Which will lead us to shew, That,</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:61714:42"/>
                  <hi>IV.</hi> Evil things are Ordered and
Appointed to us by God, from the same
<hi>Principle</hi> that Good things are: And
therefore the Evil things which come
from His Hand are Good, considered as
coming from thence.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Evils which we receive at
the Hand of God, are exceeding <hi>Few</hi> in
comparison of the Good things, which
are innumerable. <hi>Our Good things
are so many, that we are dayly load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them.</hi> Blessed be the Lord,
<hi>saith the</hi> psalmist, who darly loadeth
us with His Benefits, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he</hi> thus <hi>addresseth himself to
God,</hi> Psal. 40. 5. Many, O Lord my
God, are Thy Wonderful Works which
Thou hast done, and Thy Thoughts which
are to us ward: They cannot be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in Order unto Thee; if I should
declare and speak of them, they are more
than can be numbered.</p>
            <p>It is impossible for us to draw an
<hi>Inventory</hi> of the <hi>Thousandth</hi> part of
those Blessings, which in a very short
time we all receive from the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Heaven. Every Minute of our
Lives is full of Mercies, nor can we
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61714:42"/>
see any Place, which doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with Effects and Expressions
of the Divine Benignity: Whether
we look upwards or downwards, or
round about us, or <hi>within</hi> us, as well
as <hi>without</hi> us. And all Considerative
Persons are able to make a large Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of more <hi>special</hi> Favours, from
time to time conferred upon them,
over and above those which are the
Common Portion of their Fellow
Creatures.</p>
            <p>Nay, as it is certainly beyond the
Ability of a <hi>Finite</hi> Understanding, to
comprehend all the <hi>individual</hi> Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
which every Man is oblig'd to
God for; so is it too much for an
<hi>Humane</hi> Understanding to number all
the several <hi>Species</hi> and <hi>Sorts</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>We can begin with Meat, Drink
and Cloaths, Health and Strength,
the Use of our Reason, and many
Bodily and Mental Endowments:
And we can proceed to Friends and
Relations, to Preventions of Evils
<hi>feared,</hi> and Deliverances from Evils
<hi>felt,</hi> &amp;c. But when we have gone as
far as we can, we can not say how
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61714:43"/>
much we have fallen short of filling
up the Account; and are fain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
our selves at last, with summing
up all in such Generals as <hi>these,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,
Conveniences and Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities:
Things Profitable, Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Pleasant: Bodily and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
good things; or those which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to our Well-being in <hi>this</hi> World,
and to our <hi>Eternal</hi> Happiness in the
<hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now what an Argument is</hi> this,
<hi>to perswade us to do what we shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is implyed, in</hi> Receiving Evil at
God<hi>'s</hi> Hand! <hi>viz.</hi> For now and then a
Days Cloudy Weather, I have many
Weeks of Sun-shine: For a few Weeks
Sickness, I have many Months, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Years of Health: Evils fall upon
me in thin Drops, but Good things come
down in plentiful Showers; Or I have
many Thousands of Good things, for
One of Evil.</p>
            <p>This Consideration must needs
make us sensible, that it is the most
disingenuous thing in the World, to
forget our Obligations to God for an
infinite Number of Good things, by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61714:43"/>
means of the <hi>Greatest</hi> of those (Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
speaking) extremely few
Evils, from which His Providence
does not protect us.</p>
            <p>Nay, there is <hi>One</hi> Gift of GOD,
which <hi>Alone</hi> will Weigh down all
the Temporal Evils that do, or can
befal us; Namely, That of <hi>His own
Son:</hi> How then are they Out-weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>this,</hi> and all the other Fruits
of the Divine Mercy and Bounty put
together!</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Another Consideration
that adds much to the force of this
Motive, is, That</hi> our Good things are
all Undeserved, even the very least of
them: But we deserve all the Evils
we Suffer, and incomparably more and
greater, than are inflicted in this Life.
<hi>There is no good man, but will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
say with</hi> Iacob, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. I
am not Worthy of the least of all the
Mercies, and of all the Truth, which
Thou hast sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wed unto Thy Servant.</p>
            <p>It is impossible that such poor Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
Creatures as <hi>We</hi> are, should
be able to do any Service, whereby
we can Challenge the least Reward
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61714:44"/>
at the Hands of our Creator, upon
the account of Merit.</p>
            <p>Indeed the notion of a <hi>Creature</hi>
is inconsistent with the least deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Him. A creature owing
all that it <hi>is,</hi> and all the Power it
hath, to its Maker. It being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
Dependent thing, and Unable
to Act or to Subsist one Moment,
but by virtue of its dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its First Cause. And therefore
the Glorious <hi>Angels</hi> themselves must
needs acknowledge, that they are
obliged to the Divine Grace for all
the Blessings they Enjoy.</p>
            <p>And as the notion of a <hi>Creature</hi>
Excludeth all Merit in reference to
<hi>God,</hi> so doth the notion of a <hi>God,</hi>
render it impossible for a Creature
to Merit of Him. For that Notion
being <hi>Absolute Perfection, and Infinite
Self-Sufficiency,</hi> it is impossible to do
God a Kindness; and for him to be
Beholden to any one. <hi>Can a Man,</hi>
saith <hi>Eliphaz, be Profitable to God, as
he that is Wise may be Profitable unto
himself? Is it any Pleasure,</hi> or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Happiness, <hi>to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61714:44"/>
that thou art Righteous? Or is it
Gain to Him, that thou makest thy ways
Perfect?</hi> Job 21. 2, 3. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I say, there can be no proper
Meriting at <hi>His</hi> Hands.</p>
            <p>But on the Contrary, the Evils we
receive are all <hi>Deserved.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be Convinced of our ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
when we Consider that we are
Lapsed and Apostate Creatures; and
how we have Transgressed the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Laws of Righteousness, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
the Great Sovereign of the
World, by innumerable Acts of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.
He knows not what <hi>Sin</hi>
is; what Horrible Injustice is in it;
how Intolerably Presumptuous a
thing it is, for Creatures to oppose
their wills to the Wise and Good
Will of their Great Creator; nor
does he know what Prodigious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
nor what Desperate Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
every Wilful Sin against God
Implyeth, who is not sensible that
the Worst of Evils are deserved by
him.</p>
            <p>And whosoever have a due Sense
of their Sins, will say whilst under
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61714:45"/>
the Heaviest Calamities with <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi>
in the Name of the Rebellious
<hi>Israelites, How be it, Thou Lord art
just in all that is come upon us, for Thou
hast done Right, but we have done Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,</hi>
Ch. 9. 33. And with <hi>Ezra,
Thou hast punished us less than our
Iniquities deserve,</hi> Chap. 9. 13.</p>
            <p>And as in the General, all Kinds
of Evils are deserved by us, as we
have been more or less Guilty of
Wilful sinning, so whatsoever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Evils we at any time fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
we are, I doubt, (ordinarily
at least) Conscious to our selves of
having more especially deserved each
of them, by such and such Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Sins. Who, for instance, when
he is cast upon a Bed of Sickness,
is not sensible that he deserveth to
be deprived of his <hi>Health,</hi> by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
too much abused it while he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
it; or by having been too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
for it? <hi>Who</hi> when he hath
lost a Dear <hi>Relative,</hi> doth not, or
ought not, to Reflect upon his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
over-loved him, or not having
had a due value for the Blessing he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61714:45"/>
had in him; or not having dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his duty towards him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
where is that Man to be found,
who, when he has Susteined a great
Loss in his <hi>Estate,</hi> is not compelled
by his Conscience to acknowledge
that this is very just upon him, for
his having made it Serviceable to
some Lust or other, or his having
made an <hi>Idol</hi> of it, and Preferred it
before <hi>God;</hi> or for doing too little
<hi>good</hi> with it, or for minding the great
Concerns of his Soul and the other
Life, the <hi>Less</hi> for it? <hi>Who,</hi> when
he is wronged in his <hi>Good-Name,</hi> can
say he deserves not to suffer in this
kind from the Providence of God,
either for having so wronged <hi>Others;</hi>
or for not being so tender as he ought
to have been of their Reputation; or
for having been too forward, to take
up Reports against men, without good
Evidence; or over-valuing his own
Credit, and Priding himself therein;
or for not having Endeavoured as he
ought, to promote the interest of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
thereby; nor Imployed it to those
good Ends and Purposes, upon the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61714:46"/>
account of which a good Name in the
World is chiefly desirable?</p>
            <p>Now what Stronger Arguing can
there be than <hi>this?</hi> Do we receive
good things in so great an Abundance,
from the Hand of God, when our
Merits could not Claim the very <hi>least</hi>
of them; and is it then Reasonable
that we should think <hi>much</hi> of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Evil things also from the same
Hand; when our Hearts Accuse us
of having <hi>deserved</hi> every one of them,
and much greater Evils too, than have
ever befallen us?</p>
            <p>I will bear, <hi>saith the Prophet,</hi> the
Indignation of the Lord, because I have
Sinned against Him, <hi>Micah Ch.</hi> 7. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It adds still <hi>more</hi> Force and
Strength to this Motive, to Consider,
That <hi>We</hi> need <hi>Evil things as well as
Good, and no less than Good things.</hi>
Afflictions are needful for all <hi>Sorts</hi> of
People: For the Bad; for the more
Imperfectly Good, and even for the
very Best.</p>
            <p>I. They are Needful, and most <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi>
for <hi>Bad</hi> People. For those
<hi>who live without God in the World;</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61714:46"/>
who make none, or but little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of their Ways; who live in
great Forgetfulness of their being Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Gods Sovereign Authority,
of their Continual Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Him, both for their Well-being
and their Continuance in Being, and
of their Unspeakable Obligations to
Him; <hi>Who are alienated from the Life
of God,</hi> and wholly addicted to the
Animal and Sensual Life, and Mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of the Concerns of their Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Souls.</p>
            <p>Afflictions are so necessary for such
as <hi>these,</hi> that no other Means are like
to be Effectual to their Conversion,
<hi>to the Opening of their Eyes, and the
turning them from Darkness to Light,
and from the Power of Satan to God,</hi>
Except they are inforced by them.</p>
            <p>Afflictions are in their <hi>own nature</hi>
apt to make men <hi>Serious,</hi> and to put
Vain People upon <hi>Considering,</hi> as well
as by their being <hi>backed</hi> with the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Grace.</hi> They are most Proper
Means to this End, as they <hi>force</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to retire from their Naughty
Companions, and from their Sports
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61714:47"/>
and Pastimes (especially if they are
very Smarting and Painful) and from
all their <hi>Secular</hi> Employments too,
by setting their hearts on which,
they are continually diverted from
concerning themselves in the Affairs
of Religion and the other World;
and as they render all Carnal and
Worldly Delights and Pleasures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury
to them. Afflictions do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
naturally Excite men to <hi>Call upon
God,</hi> especially when they are sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that <hi>He alone</hi> is able to Help them;
and Awaken their Consciences, and
make them Reflect upon their many
Miscarriages, as having Provoked
Him to inflict them. And they as
naturally put them upon making
Strong Resolutions to amend their
Lives for the Atoning of His displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>Thus the Woman of <hi>Zarephath,</hi>
upon the suddain death of her Child,
Cryed out to the Prophet, <hi>Art thou
come unto me to call my Sin to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
and to Slay my Son?</hi> 1 Kings
17. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus</hi> Iosephs <hi>Brethren, upon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61714:47"/>
the Severity he used towards them,</hi>
Said one to another, we are verily Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Concerning our Brother; in that we
Saw the Anguish of his Soul when he
besought us, and we would not hear;
therefore is this distress come upon us.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God saith,</hi> Hosea 5. 15. I will go and
return to my Place, <hi>or I will withdraw
my Protection from them,</hi> till they
acknowledge their Offence, and seek my
Face: In their Affliction they will
seek me Early.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it is said,</hi> Psal. 78. 34. When
He Slew them, then they Sought Him,
and they Returned and Enquired after
God. And they Remembred that God
was their Rock, and the High God
their Redeemer. <hi>Or,</hi> then <hi>they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
this <hi>to mind, who till they were
Afflicted, could never be perswaded
to Consider it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Stubborn a Wretch as <hi>Pharoah</hi>
was, his Hard heart was quickly from
time to time Softned by the <hi>Plagues,</hi>
and it reteined its Softness under <hi>each
Plague,</hi> till it was removed.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Prodigal Son</hi> was brought
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61714:48"/>
to extream Penury, he soon <hi>came to
himself</hi> and Returned to his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King</hi> Manasseh <hi>was a Prodigy of
Wickedness, yet</hi> When he was in
Affliction <hi>(as the Text saith)</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
the Lord his God, and Humbled
himself greatly before the God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And Prayed unto Him, and He
was intreated of him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh</hi>
knew that the Lord He is God.
<hi>Or he had a</hi> Powerful Sense <hi>thereof
upon his Mind,</hi> 2 Chron. 33. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Afflictions are so necessary to the
Conversion of Sinners, that those who
have spent many years in a Loose
Sort of Life, are very rarely Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Reclaimed otherways, than by
Gods Blessing upon some Sharp Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
            <p>II. Evil things, or Afflictions,
are very Needful and Necessary for
<hi>Imperfectly Good,</hi> as well as for Bad,
People. They greatly need them, in
order to their <hi>Growing in Grace,</hi> and
rising to higher degrees of Goodness.</p>
            <p>Particularly, in order to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more Watchful against Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Sin. This Experience King
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61714:48"/>
               <hi>David</hi> had of the Benefit of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>Before I was Afflicted,</hi> saith he,
<hi>I went Astray, but now have I kept
thy Word.</hi> Psal. 119. 67.</p>
            <p>In order to the more weaning them
from this Vain World, and the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of all Remainders of Sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</p>
            <p>In order to the more Humbling
them, under a Sense of their Frailty
and Impotence, and their more close
dependence upon God.</p>
            <p>In order to the more Softning of
their Hearts, and more opening their
Bowels of Compassion towards <hi>others</hi>
in Affliction. None have such a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
with their Suffering Brethren,
as those who are made sensible of the
Sadness of their Condition, by their
own Feeling.</p>
            <p>In order to their more loving of
God, and Trusting in Him. To which
the Experience they have had of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Supports under Afflictions, and
Deliverances out of them, doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Contribute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In short, by Afflictions</hi> The Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of <hi>Jacob</hi> is purged, and this is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61714:49"/>
all the Fruit, to take away his Sin.
<hi>Isaiah</hi> 22. 14.</p>
            <p>III. Evil things are needful too
even for the Eminently Good. And
that, as upon <hi>some</hi> of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Accounts, so more Especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</p>
            <p>1. For Prevention. For which End
the most Healthy Persons do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
take Physick. St <hi>Paul,</hi> as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
a Saint as he was, had a <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of Satan sent to Buffet him, lest
he should be Exalted above measure,
through the Abundance of his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
as he tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.</p>
            <p>There are none so Good as to be
out of <hi>all</hi> danger, while they remain
in this World; as to be able to bear
long and uninterrupted Prosperity,
without being lyable to be the worse
for it in several respects.</p>
            <p>Who is so Humble, who so Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
minded, as to have no Reason
to fear his being too much Opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
of himself, and loving the world
too much, if God did not sometimes
mind him what an infirm and weak
Creature he is, by Afflictions of one
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61714:49"/>
kind or other, and never imbittered
his Comforts to him?</p>
            <p>2. The Best People need them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
for the Tryal and Exercise of
some Graces and Virtues, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be exerted without them. What
Exercise can there be of the Grace of
<hi>Contentment,</hi> while all things succeed
according to a man's desire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation?
Of <hi>Patience,</hi> while he feels
no pain? Of Submission to <hi>God</hi>'s Will,
while God never Crosseth his <hi>Own</hi>
Will? Of <hi>Meekness</hi> and <hi>Forgiveness
of Enemies,</hi> while he hath no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to forgive, or meets with no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
from them? And this leads
me to Add,</p>
            <p>3. That the Best do need Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in Order to their doing so much
the more Credit to Religion, and the
more benefiting the World by their
Examples. For we have now seen,
that they cannot be Examples of <hi>all</hi>
Virtues without them.</p>
            <p>4. The Best need them also, to
make them so much the more to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
and consequently to be the more
Thankful for, the Good things they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61714:50"/>
enjoy. There is no Man so good, but
he prizeth Health the more, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some times Sick. No man can
be so affected with his Obligations to
God for any Blessing, who never was
without it, as <hi>he</hi> who hath <hi>felt</hi> how
uneasie and grievous a thing it is to
<hi>want</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Nay, were there no Life after <hi>this,</hi> we
should think <hi>tolerable</hi> Evils necessary
to give the better <hi>Gusto,</hi> &amp; a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Relish to the Gratifications of our
<hi>Senses.</hi> The more Hungry or Thirsty
a Man is, the greater is the Pleasure
he takes in Eating or Drinking. How
pleasant is a Bed or Couch to a Man
tyred with hard Labour; a cool Shade
to one parched with Heat; Liberty
after Confinement; the Enjoyment of
a dear Relation or Friend, after a long
Absence; and even <hi>Indolence</hi> or mere
<hi>Ease,</hi> after great Pain! As <hi>Socrates</hi>
observed, in his last Discourse with
his Friends, after he was rid of his
<hi>Shackles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And perhaps there are not many
Evils, which we are able to bear with
any patience, and that continue not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61714:50"/>
over-long, which do not make us a
good Recompence, by the much more
pleasant Enjoyment we have of the
Opposite Good things, upon their
Leaving us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The last Consideration I
named, which gives great Weight to
the Motive in the Text, <hi>To Receive
Evil things at the Hand of God, is,</hi>
That they are Ordered and Appointed
to us by God, from the Self-same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
that Good things are, <hi>viz. That
of Good Will.</hi> And therefore, as was
said, the Evils which come from Him
are Good, <hi>as</hi> they come from Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is an Excellent Saying to
this Purpose of an</hi> Heathen <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
viz:<note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctet.</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chirid. c. 34. p. 167</note> Simplicius, We do not say
that the Divine Iustice is the Cause of
Evil, but of Good; because the Evil
which proceeds from thence, is in order
to Good.</p>
            <p>We have seen that all sorts of Men
do <hi>need</hi> Evil things, as well as Good;
and we are now to shew, that God
inflicts them, <hi>because</hi> we need them.</p>
            <p>We have shewed, That they are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61714:51"/>
Spiritual <hi>Physick,</hi> for the Cure of the
Maladies of our Souls; and we find
that for <hi>this</hi> Reason God sends them,
in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 9, 10. The Apostle tells
us in some of the foregoing Verses,
That in the <hi>general,</hi> Gods End in his
Chastizements is <hi>good;</hi> that <hi>Good-will</hi>
is the Principle from whence they
proceed; and in <hi>these</hi> he shews <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,</hi>
that God designs our <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
Advantage by them. <hi>Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>
saith he, <hi>we have had Fathers
of our Flesh which corrected us, and
we gave them reverence; shall we not
much more be in Subjection to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Spirits<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and Live? For they
verily for a few days chastened us, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their own pleasure; but He for our
Profit, that we might be Partakers of
His Holiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have shewn, That Afflictions
are needful, not onely for Correction,
in Order to our Amendment, but,
for Tryal too; and we read that this
End also <hi>God</hi> hath in them, 1 Pet. 1.
6, 7.—<hi>Now for a Season (if need
be) ye are in Heaviness through mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Temptations: That the Tryal of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61714:51"/>
your Faith being much more precious
than that of Gold which perisheth, tho'
it be tryed with Fire</hi> (or, it being of
much more Advantage to your Faith,
than the Tryal of Gold is to Gold,
because it will <hi>wear out,</hi> tho' it can
bear the trial of Fire) <hi>might be found
unto Praise, &amp; Honour, &amp; Glory, at the
appearing of Iesus Christ.</hi> And 1 Pet.
4. 12. <hi>Think it not strange concerning
the Fiery Tryal, which is to Try you,
&amp;c.</hi> or, is designed by <hi>God</hi> for this
purpose.</p>
            <p>God is alike good in the Evils He
inflicts, &amp; the Good things he con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers
upon us; as the <hi>Physitian</hi> hath the <hi>same</hi>
Good design towards his Patient, in
his Griping Physick and Comforting
Cordials: He equally aims at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his Health, in making him
Uneasy with the <hi>One,</hi> and Chearing
his Spirits with the <hi>Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore Considering this <hi>Last</hi>
with the <hi>foregoing</hi> Particulars; nay,
tho' there were no <hi>other</hi> but this to be
considered, <hi>well</hi> might <hi>Iob</hi> say, <hi>Shall we
receive Good at the Hand of God, and
shall we not receive Evil?</hi> And infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61714:52"/>
reason have we, not only to
be Patient under Evil things, but to
be Thankful for them too; seeing they
are not so Evil Considered in <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
as they are Good Considering
their <hi>Design;</hi> seeing, if we will Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
therewith, they are not more
painful than they are profitable, nor
so Injurious to our <hi>Outward</hi> Man, as
Beneficial to our <hi>Inward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will Conclude</hi> this <hi>Argument with
the Words of another of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
viz.<note n="*" place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in <hi>Epictet.</hi> l. 2. c. 6. p 117.</note> Epictetus <hi>in</hi> Arrian; O
Man, what dost thou? Why dost thou
not rid thy self of all this Trouble?
Adventure at last, with eyes lifted up
to God, to say unto Him; Vse me, O
God, for the future at Thine own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
Thou hast my freest Consent. I
am of the same Mind that Thou art,
I have a Mind to nothing but what Thou
thinkest Good. Lead me whither Thou
wilt, Cloath me as Thou pleasest. Wilt
Thou have me bear an Office, or shall I
live a private Life? Must I stay, or
must I fly? Shall I be Poor, or shall
I be Rich? I am ready to Obey, I will
defend Thee against all the World. I
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61714:52"/>
will make an Apology for Thy Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
about these things to every Body.
I say that all is Good, because Thou art
so. <hi>What could he have said better,
had he been a Christian?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to prevent Mistakes, I desire
it may be observed, that I have not
said that in <hi>whatsoever</hi> Evils men may
Suffer, God aimeth at the benefit and
advantage of the <hi>Sufferers;</hi> for had
I affirmed <hi>this</hi> I could not have justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
it: There being <hi>some</hi> Evils which
we have cause to look upon as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Iudgments,</hi> and as proceeding from
mere Vengeance, in reference to those
on whom they are inflicted. As
when a Notoriously wicked Wretch
is Cut off in the very Act of some
Horrible Wickedness. Instances of
this kind are not only to be found
in the <hi>Sacred</hi> Records, but our <hi>Own</hi>
Age hath produced <hi>such,</hi> and Possibly
<hi>no</hi> Age hath been without them. And
when provoking Sinners are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in their Sins, without any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Warning. But it is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
most true, that God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's
Design is <hi>Good</hi> in <hi>all</hi> Evils; for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61714:53"/>
when He means not the Good of the
<hi>Sufferers,</hi> He intends a more Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Publick Good: That all
Spectators of such Judgments, and
those to whom the Notice of them
shall come, may be Scared by them
from those Impious Practises which
drew them down.</p>
            <p>But I will add, That those have
not the least reason to fear, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
things of any nature whatsoever,
have fallen upon them in <hi>mere Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
who do not feel themselves gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up to <hi>Hardness of heart;</hi> by which
Phrase we are to understand <hi>Pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Will,</hi> or to a <hi>Reprobate Sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
but find that their Afflictions have a
good influence upon their Minds;
that they make them more Serious,
and Excite in them good Inclinations,
and Awaken them to Consider <hi>the
things which belong to their Peace,</hi> and
Eternal Happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are now come to the
<hi>Inferences,</hi> which are to be drawn
from the Doctrine we have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:61714:53"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> I Infer from thence, <hi>how</hi> we
are to Pray Against Afflictions, <hi>viz.</hi>
Not Absolutely, but <hi>Conditionally,</hi>
and with intire Submission.</p>
            <p>That it is Lawful to deprecate
them, we are well assured, in that
we find not only the best Men so
doing in H. Scripture, but also our
Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> Himself. He did so,
<hi>Iohn 12. 27. Now is my Soul troubled,
and what shall I say? Father Save me
from this Hour.</hi> And He doth the like,
<hi>Matth. 26. 39. O my Father, if it be
Possible, let this Cup pass from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But we have also His Example,
for Praying against the Bitter Cup</hi>
Conditionally, <hi>and with Submission to
the Will of His Father. This is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in those words,</hi> if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
<hi>That is, to give it in the words
of</hi> Grotius, if it be Consistent with Thy
Decrees, that by any other Means Thy
Glory, and the Salvation of Mankind,
may be Equally Provided for. <hi>And
this Condition, we have in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressest
terms in the latter part of
that Verse,</hi> Nevertheless not as I will
but as Thou wilt. <hi>Again, V.</hi> 42. O

my Father, if this Cup may not pass
away Except I drink it, Thy Will be
done. <hi>And V. 44. it is said,</hi> He went
away and Prayed the third time, Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the same Submission is Imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Text first cited; For after
our Lord had said,</hi> Father Save me
from this Hour, <hi>and so expressed
His</hi> Natural <hi>Aversion thereunto, it
follows,</hi> But for this Cause came I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Hour. <hi>Which is as much as
to say,</hi> But being assured that it is Thy
Pleasure that I must undergo this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Death, I heartily Submit. <hi>But
there are others who read these words,</hi>
Father Save me from this Hour, <hi>with
an Interrogation Point, &amp; so they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Him</hi> thus <hi>to speak,</hi> What shall
I say? Shall I say, Father Save me
from this Hour? No I will not, as
well knowing that Thou hast determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
otherwise.</p>
            <p>And it is evident, that no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Evils are to be prayed against
<hi>otherwise,</hi> in that Afflictions of one
sort or other, are such things, as hath
been shewed, as we have Need of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61714:54"/>
several Accounts; and there is no
particular Affliction but it is better
for us to undergo it, than to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, for ought we know. We are
therefore to refer our selves to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
Wisdom of God, who knows
in all Circumstances what is best for
<hi>us,</hi> and best in <hi>it self,</hi> after we have
prayed Him to keep off such an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
or to remove it.</p>
            <p>It becomes us consequently not to
Beg <hi>either,</hi> Over-passionately and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently:
For <hi>this</hi> would be to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe</hi>
to God, and to tell <hi>Him</hi> what
is <hi>best.</hi> Those do no <hi>less</hi> than so, who
pray for Health or any outward Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
for <hi>themselves</hi> or <hi>theirs,</hi> as if they
would have <hi>no Nay.</hi> Instead of so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we ought heartily to endeavour
to bring our Minds to a full Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escence
in the Divine Wisdom and
Goodness; and to a Willingness to
bear such or such an Affliction (with
the Divine Assistance) if God sees it
<hi>fit</hi> we should; as knowing that what
<hi>He seeth</hi> fit, must necessarily <hi>be</hi> so,
and that it is Madness to be averse
to what <hi>is</hi> so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:61714:55"/>
And by this means shall we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to say that our Petitions are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
denyed. I mean, when we pray
with Submission, and desire Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
nothing but what is <hi>best</hi> for
us, or rather what is best <hi>in it self;</hi>
which also will prove to be best for
<hi>us,</hi> when we are once brought to this
happy Temper.</p>
            <p>It is said by the Author to the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> That our Saviour <hi>was heard
in that he feared.</hi> How was he heard,
since the bitter Cup of death did <hi>not</hi>
pass from him, but he did drink it?
Why, he was heard, as in <hi>other</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
so in <hi>this,</hi> that he Prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that Cursed death, not Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
but Conditionally. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he Prayed <hi>for</hi> it upon suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that it was most agreeable to the
Wise and Good Will of God that he
should Suffer it: For we have seen
that he said, <hi>Not as I will but as Thou
wilt.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>I will present you
with other most Excellent sayings of
the last Cited Philosopher.</hi> Let us
begin every thing without too Passionate
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61714:55"/>
a desire, or an Over-great aversness.
Let us behave our selves like a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
who when he comes where two Ways
meet, asks the first passenger which of
them he shall take to such a Place;
having no inclination to the Right hand,
rather than to the Left: But desiring
onely to understand the ready way to
his Iourneys End. Iust so must we go
to God, as to our Guide; as to One who
ought to dispose of us as He Pleaseth.
We must not direct Him, what Course
to take with us, but embrace that which
He Proposeth, and desire only that He
will Conduct us in the direct way to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
This is our Duty and our Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Whereas now you shall see Men run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Him; Saying, Lord have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon me, Deliver me from such or
such an Evil! Wretch that thou art,
wouldst thou have any thing but what is
Best; and who can tell what that is?
Is there any thing Best, but what shall
seem so to God? Why dost thou endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to Corrupt Him, who is thy Iudge,
and to Seduce Him who is thy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and to move Him by thy Cries to do
otherwise than He thinks sitting? Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61714:56"/>
Him therefore to follow His own
Wisdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Admirable Discourse is
<hi>this!</hi> 'Tis most worthy of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
rank of <hi>Christians.</hi> But yet it is
not very Strange, that it should come
from the Pen of a Considerative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<hi>Pagan;</hi> it being perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to Right Reason, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
to be inferred from a true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, which very many of
<hi>Them</hi> had.</p>
            <p>And Consequently what a Shame
must it needs be to us <hi>Christians,</hi> not
heartily to Endeavour to get our
Minds into this Frame.</p>
            <p>But it is a very Melancholy thing
to consider, that it should be so Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
difficult, as we generally find
it is, so to master our Passions under
great Afflictions, as to bring our selves
to an intire Acquiescence in the good
Pleasure of God; while we cannot
but Acknowledge it to be the most
Unreasonable thing imaginable, <hi>not</hi>
to rest well Satisfied therewith. And
that it should be even next to <hi>impossible,</hi>
without an Extraordinary measure of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61714:56"/>
the Divine Grace, to make our Minds
<hi>Easie</hi> under <hi>Such</hi> Afflictions (and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
for those who are of Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Bodily Tempers, be they never so
good Christians) but by the help of
Time, which without the help of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
will much deaden the sense of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Affliction.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is <hi>alike</hi> difficult
not to Pray against such Evils, as we
are Naturally inclined most to dread,
<hi>over Vehemently,</hi> and with less Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
than becomes us.</p>
            <p>But God is so Good, as to consider
our Frame, and to make Abatements
for our natural infirmities, so long as
we do not give our selves leave to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi>
and <hi>Murmur</hi> at any of His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences.</p>
            <p>One of the Philosophers, I think
<hi>Epictetus,</hi> adviseth never to Pray to
God, for any External Blessings in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi>
but only that he would do for
us in the general what is Best. And
such a Sence may be put upon <hi>One</hi>
or <hi>Two</hi> of the last recited Sayings,
tho' they do not <hi>necessarily</hi> imply it.
But he was so careful to avoid <hi>One</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:61714:57"/>
Extreme, as to run into <hi>Another,</hi> tho'
the safer of the Two. For we are
sufficiently warranted by the <hi>H. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
(and therefore <hi>that</hi> Extreme
was very pardonable in those who
were unacquainted with them) to
ask for particular Outward Blessings;
tho with great Care to do it with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
to the Wise Will of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it is very wonderful to see,
how</hi> Epictetus <hi>could</hi> himself take <hi>that
forementioned Advice, which he gave
to</hi> Others, <hi>in this following Address
he made to the Supreme Deity,</hi> viz.
Did I ever find fault with Thy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?
I was Sick when Thou
wouldst have me to be so, and so are
Others, but I was willingly Sick. I
was always Poor at Thy Appointment,
but Rejoycing. I never was a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
nor had any Dignity, because
Thou wouldest not have me, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
desired it. Didst Thou ever see
me the more out of Humour, or Cast
down for this? Have I ever appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before Thee with a discontented Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance?
Was I not always prepared
and ready for whatsoever Thou Requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>redst?
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61714:57"/>
Wilt Thou have me depart out
of this Festival Solemnity, I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to go; and I give Thee all Thanks
for having Honoured me so far, as to
give me leave to keep the Feast with
Thee, and Behold Thy Works, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Thy Government of the World.
Let Death seize on me no otherwise em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
than thus thinking and writing
of such things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he</hi> thus <hi>Appealed to his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arrian. Epict.</hi> l. 3. C. 22. P. 314.</note>
Behold I am an Exile, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
House, without Servants, I lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ground, I have no Wife, no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when did you ever
hear me Accuse either God or Man?
When did I ever Complain of any one?
Have ever any one of you seen me with
a Sad Countenance? <hi>O how few Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
can for bear Blushing at the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of</hi> these <hi>Passages!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what hath been said of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and Personal Evils, is as true of
Publick and National. <hi>These</hi> neither
are to be deprecated Absolutely; for
they are designed no less for the good
of Nations and Bodies Politick, than
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61714:58"/>
the <hi>other</hi> are for the good of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Persons. <hi>When Thy Iudgements are
abroad in the World, the In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>abitants
thereof will learn Righteousness,</hi> saith
the Prophet, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 26. 9. And that
for <hi>this</hi> end they are inflicted we are
abundantly assured. No Calamity
short of utter Destruction, ought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
to be interpreted, than as
designed for the Reformation of those
Kingdoms, Cities, and other Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
on which they fall.</p>
            <p>And God hath Threatned it as an
high Expression of His displeasure,
that He will not Punish a Wicked
People; nor certainly can there be an
<hi>higher</hi> on this side <hi>Hell.</hi> As <hi>Hosea
4. 14. I will not Punish your Daughters
when they commit Whoredom; nor your
Spouses, when they commit Adultery.</hi>
And <hi>Ver. 17. Ephraim is joyned to
Idols, let him alone.</hi> And nothing
more Severe could well come out of
the Mouth of God Almighty, than
those words, <hi>Isaiah 1. 5. Why should
you be Smitten any more? You will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
more and more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, I say, in our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61714:58"/>
for the diverting or removing
of General Judgments, we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of prescribing to <hi>God:</hi> In Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for which, without any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Expressed or Implyed, we make
our selves Wiser than infinite Wisdom.
And in so doing, we may Curse our
Selves and our Country, when we
think we Pray for both.</p>
            <p>We do now seem <hi>generally</hi> impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
desirous to have a Conclusion
put to this Bloody and <hi>Expensive War;</hi>
but yet we may not Pray Absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for it, because we are far from
knowing that it will prove <hi>best</hi> for us
to have our Prayers granted. Nay
<hi>indeed</hi> we have too great reason to
fear it will not, since this heavy Scourg
hath wrought no visible Reformation
upon us: And that the Consequence
of a <hi>Peace,</hi> and of the total Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of our Fears from <hi>Abroad,</hi> may
be an Occasion (Considering how
many Unquiet and Restless Spirits we
have among us) of running us into
Confusion at <hi>Home:</hi> Which is not
much less dreadful to think of, than
falling into the Clutches of our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61714:59"/>
Enemy;</hi> and which (without a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
interposition of Providence,
which it would be Madness to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect)
must inevitably make us a Prey
to his Teeth; and fasten for ever,
at least for <hi>this</hi> Age, our Chains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us. But if <hi>this</hi> should not be the
Effect of a <hi>Peace</hi> before we more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, and are better Prepared for
it, God hath Plagues enough for a
People <hi>who hate to be Reformed,</hi> which
may make them as Miserable as any
<hi>War</hi> can do. And so we pass to our
<hi>Second Inference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We learn from what hath
been discoursed, how great a Folly
it is for a man to Judge <hi>himself</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be <hi>out</hi> of Gods Favour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
much Afflicted. If Afflictions
were in <hi>all respects</hi> Evils, this ought
to be Concluded. But it hath been
shewed that, as they come from <hi>God's</hi>
Hand, they are good things: That
there is not only a Good Design in
them but the Best of Designs; and that
they are things apt <hi>in their own nature,</hi>
to promote our greatest Good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:61714:59"/>
Those look no farther than the
Pain and Smart of an Affliction, that
Conclude it an Expression of God's
<hi>Ill-Will.</hi> They fix their Eye only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>dark</hi> side of the Cloud, and
take no notice of the <hi>bright</hi> side. They
are People of very little Thought, and
Consideration; otherwise they would
easily call to mind, that nothing is
more common among <hi>our selves,</hi> than
Correcting and Chastising from a
principle of Love, and of the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
Love: Than putting to Pain from
the greatest <hi>Good-Will,</hi> and for the
most Charitable Purposes.</p>
            <p>They would also, if they used them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Thinking, Consider that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
makes People so Serious, or so
brings them to their rightminds, as Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.
And they could not (if well
acquainted with the <hi>Bible)</hi> but think
of such Texts as <hi>these: Whom the
Lord loveth he Correcteth, as a Father
the Son in whom he delighteth,</hi> Prov.
3. 12. <hi>Happy is the man whom God
Correcteth,</hi> Job. 5. 17. <hi>Whom the Lord
loveth He Chastneth, and Scourgeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Son whom He receiveth,</hi> Heb. 12.
6, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:61714:60"/>
If it be Replyed, That tho' every
Affliction is no sign of a persons being
out of the Favour of God, yet being
exercised with frequent, long and
sharp Afflictions, seems not consistent
with His Love: Those who make
<hi>This</hi> Reply, need only to be minded,
of the Calamities which fell on <hi>Iob;</hi>
who being declared by God Himself
to be an Upright, &amp; most Exemplarily
Good Man, could not but be His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Favourite: Or of the
Terrible Afflictions with which King
<hi>David,</hi> tho' a Man <hi>after God's own
Heart,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and
many other of the Best Men in the
<hi>Old</hi> Testament, were exercised: And
those of the Great St. <hi>Paul</hi> and others,
which we read of in the <hi>New.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, those who think there are
such Temporal Evils, as cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with the Love of God, must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that His Onely Begotten Son,
was an Object of His Hatred.</p>
            <p>But God's Hatred is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be concluded from any Evils
that <hi>here</hi> befal us, that we cannot
certainly conclude so much as His
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61714:60"/>
               <hi>Anger</hi> from <hi>any whatsoever,</hi> without
taking in <hi>other</hi> Considerations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that of the <hi>Nature</hi> of those E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.
For we have seen that they
come from God's Hand, for diverse
other Ends besides <hi>that</hi> of Punishing
for Sin. And this may be said even
of the <hi>greatest</hi> that are of a mere Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Nature. For we do not find,
that there was any thing of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Iob</hi>'s Calamities; and we are
certain there was nothing of it, in our
<hi>Saviour</hi>'s Sufferings. That is, they
could not be inflicted upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of any Displeasure <hi>He</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to His Heavenly Father, because
in <hi>Him was no Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And considering what hath been
said upon this Subject, it would be no
unaccountable thing, if none were
ever so Afflicted as God's Children.
No nor if His <hi>dearest</hi> Children, that
is the <hi>best</hi> CHRISTIANS, and
those who have arrived to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degrees of Virtue and Goodness,
should be always <hi>most</hi> Afflicted of <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
of His Children. This would be
no perplexing Providence, because
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61714:61"/>
               <hi>such</hi> would make the best Examples
to the World of bearing Afflictions,
of Patience, chearful and thankful
Submission to the Will of God under
them.</p>
            <p>Nor would they judge themselves
upon a little sedate thinking, <hi>hardly</hi>
dealt with, if the <hi>better Christians</hi>
they are, the <hi>more</hi> they should be Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
because <hi>they look not at the
things that are seen,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi>
speaks, <hi>but at the things that are not
seen: The things that are seen being
Temporal, but the things that are not
seen, Eternal.</hi> They know that they
shall have an Abundant Recompence
made them <hi>hereafter,</hi> for all their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<hi>here: That they are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
as the same Apostle saith, <hi>to be
compared with the Glory, which shall be
revealed in them:</hi> That the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinariness
of their Afflictions for a
short time, shall (through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of their Saviour) procure to them
an extraordinary degree of Heavenly
Bliss to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>And they find also, especially if
their Sufferings be for Righteousness
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61714:61"/>
sake, supports at <hi>present</hi> suitable to
their Burdens; and that <hi>as their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi>
abound, their Consolations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
likewise.</p>
            <p>And thus we see what a weak thing
it is, to have the worse Opinion of
our Spiritual Estate, or to conclude
our selves out of the Divine Favour,
upon the Account of our being much
afflicted: And how Unchristian a
thing it is, to pass, like <hi>Iob</hi>'s Friends,
severe Censures on <hi>others</hi> upon the
like Accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">I could Name one of the most
Eminent Persons, and <hi>Christians</hi> too,
of the Age he lived in, who was so
far from looking upon great Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,

or Displeasure, that one Day read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the 12th. to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where

case to his Mind.</hi> But this Great

of St. <hi>Paul, we must through much
Tribulation enter into the Kingdom of
God:</hi> And that other, <hi>All that will
live godly in Christ Iesus, must suffer
persecution,</hi> they had doubtless a <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:61714:62"/>
relation to <hi>that</hi> Time when they
were spoken. When a Man could not
make Profession of Christianity, and
adhere thereto, but he must expect
to suffer greatly for it. Tho' the
World was never <hi>yet</hi> I doubt so good,
as that there hath been a Time when
<hi>this</hi> could not be truly said, <hi>The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Conscience Men make of their ways,
and the more strictly they keep to the
Rules of Righteousness and Goodness, the
more Trouble they must make Account
of:</hi> Especially when it relates to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in publick Stations. Tho' it must
be acknowledged too, that <hi>these</hi> Mens
Troubles are not to be compared with
those, in which the bold Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of those Rules are, in a well Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
Nation, frequently involved.</p>
            <p>In short, We are to judge of <hi>our
own</hi> Spiritual Estate, by considering
how it is <hi>within</hi> us, not <hi>without</hi> us.
And we are to judge of <hi>Others,</hi> as
to <hi>that</hi> State, by their Lives and
Manners, not by their Outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
This Rule our Blessed
<hi>Lord</hi> hath taught us, in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61714:63"/>
of the <hi>Thirteenth</hi> Chapter of
St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I Infer from what hath
been said upon this Subject, That it
is a part of great Wisdom, to be, when
we are in the most <hi>easie</hi> Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
often thinking of a Change, and
preparing our selves for New Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
This will be a means to make
them much <hi>easier</hi> to be born when
they come; and may be a means to
<hi>prevent</hi> their coming, because by thus
doing we must needs have so much
the less <hi>Need</hi> of them. But the more
we <hi>need</hi> one Affliction or other, the
more reason have we to <hi>expect</hi> it,
from the Consideration even of the
Divine <hi>Goodness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Good People should make the
less Account of any Long Uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Prosperity in this World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have not their <hi>Portion</hi>
here, as the Wicked have. And it is
very unreasonable for those to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
upon a kind of Heaven <hi>here,</hi>
who upon the best Grounds do hope
for a Heaven <hi>hereafter;</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61714:63"/>
on passing through Temporal
Pleasures to Eternal Ones.</p>
            <p>We ought in all reason, if we think
Heaven our Home, to be very well
satisfied, to live on <hi>Earth</hi> like <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
and Strangers.</hi> As the Apostle
saith the Good <hi>Patriarchs Confessed</hi>
themselves to be, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13.</p>
            <p>If we look upon Heaven as our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Rest, how can we so much
as <hi>hope,</hi> that our Condition <hi>here</hi> will
be better than that of <hi>Travellers?</hi>
Who use to make full Account of a
deal of Rugged and Foul, as well as
Smooth and Clean Way; Who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
not to have Dry and Serene
Weather always, nor scarcely for the
<hi>most</hi> part; who are not at all surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at Rain, Wind and Storms, as <hi>if
some strange thing happened to them.</hi>
Nor do they think themselves Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
if they meet with more Scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heat, than Cool Shade; or with
more Uncivil than Kind and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Usage in a Strange Country, so
long as they hope to get safe to their
Journeys End; and know that they
shall find all things <hi>there</hi> most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61714:64"/>
to their desires, and to their hearts
Content.</p>
            <p>Good Christians need not be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the <hi>Captain of their Salvation</hi>
Himself <hi>was made Perfect by Sufferings;</hi>
as the Apostle saith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. That
He took the Cross in the way to His
Crown. That <hi>He was a Man of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
and acquainted with Grief</hi> before
He could enter upon the possession of
<hi>That Ioy which was set before Him:</hi>
That <hi>He entred into the Kingdom of</hi>
Heaven, <hi>through much Tribulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can they think that GOD
hath any Reason, to be more Tender
of <hi>them</hi> than of His Dear <hi>Son;</hi> nor
imagine themselves ill dealt with, if it
fareth no worse with <hi>them</hi> than it
did with <hi>Him.</hi> Or, if God will have
them go the same Uneasie Way to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Bliss, that <hi>He</hi> went. They can
not see the least Cause to complain,
if He will have the Members to be
conformed to their Head in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
in <hi>this</hi> World, as well as in the
World to come.</p>
            <p>Those are therefore very impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that because of their <hi>having</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:61714:64"/>
suffered Severe things, presume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a long Respite from the like again.
It is possible they may have such a
Respite, but it ought not to be with
any Confidence Expected; because
there is no Reason on which to found
such an Expectation, as hath been
shewed.</p>
            <p>And (by the way) it would be
a very great Folly, in reference to
the <hi>Publick,</hi> to Conclude upon Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Times, if we were once eased of
our present Burdens and Complaints,
and Effectually Secured from our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Fears. For when we are biggest
with hopes of a most Prosperous State
of Affairs, and that <hi>God will make us
Glad, according to the days wherein he
hath Afflicted us, and the years where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we have seen Evil,</hi> some unthought
of Calamity may Suddenly Seize us;
as we have again and again found by
Experience. For how <hi>often</hi> have we
seen cause to say with the Prophet,
<hi>We looked for Peace, but no good came;
and for a time of Health, but behold
Trouble! Ier.</hi> 8. 15. And to allude
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61714:65"/>
to <hi>that</hi> in the 18<hi>th.</hi> V. <hi>Many a time,
when we have been Comforting our selves
against more Sorrow,</hi> there hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ned one Cross thing or
other, which hath Caused <hi>our Hearts
to Faint in us.</hi> And so, no doubt, it
will be for the <hi>future</hi> with us, if we
continue as Unreformed as Ever. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
our Good God should give us
Over, for an Obdurate and incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
People, and no farther concern
Himself for our Amendment. But,
as hath been intimated, <hi>this</hi> is the
Saddest of <hi>all</hi> Judgments; and it
speaks Eternal Destruction to be Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon those People, upon whom it
lighteth.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Matter in
hand; We seeing so great Reason,
while we remain in this World, to
look for New Afflictions, it greatly
Concerns us to be still preparing our
selves for them, that they may not
come upon us before we are Aware.
For whensoever they do so, we shall
find them so much the Heavier and
more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntolerable; and that it requires
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61714:65"/>
much the longer time for the so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
our Passions to our Reason, as
to be able to demean our selves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,
and as becomes <hi>Men,</hi> and
much more as becomes <hi>Christians,</hi>
under them.</p>
            <p>As the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> saith, <hi>Eccles.
41. 1. O Death, how bitter is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of thee, to a Man that liveth
at Rest in his Possessions; unto the Man
who hath nothing to Vex him, and that
hath Prosperity in all things!</hi> So may
it be said, How bitter, how unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
is a great Affliction to a Man,
when it falleth upon him all of a <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain;</hi>
when he thought of nothing less,
than <hi>Afflictions!</hi> How <hi>Weak</hi> doth a
Sad Providence find a Man, when
at the time of its comming he had
<hi>Put far from him the Evil day,</hi> and
did not in the least dream of any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of his Condition!</p>
            <p>What a Horrible Surprize must it
have been to the <hi>Rich man</hi> in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
(had it been no Parable but a
real History) to hear those words,
<hi>Thou Foool this night shall thy Soul be
required of thee, then whose shall those
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61714:66"/>
Things be, which thou hast Provided?</hi>
at that very instant, when he was
saying to himself, <hi>Thou hast Goods laid
up for many Years; Take thine Ease,
Eat, Drink and be Merry!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I infer from the <hi>Text,</hi>
what a Wonderfully Powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
the Hopes we have of Receiving
such Glorious Things in the <hi>Future</hi>
life, must needs be, <hi>To Receive Evil
things at the Hand of God</hi> in <hi>this</hi> life.
If our Receiving the Good things of
this <hi>Present</hi> State, be such a Motive
thereto as hath been shewed, then
<hi>What</hi> a Motive is that of the Hope of
infinitely better Things in that to
<hi>come!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Confess that the Motive in the
<hi>Text</hi> hath the Advantage, as the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there of is Things <hi>present,</hi> and
the Matter of the other, Things to
<hi>come:</hi> But considering all the <hi>other</hi>
differences, between these <hi>two</hi> sorts
of Good things; and that there is the
greatest assurance imaginable given to
good People, of their hereafter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
those Good things, there is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61714:66"/>
no Comparison to be made between
<hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> Motive.</p>
            <p>It is impossible, that <hi>he</hi> should think
<hi>God</hi> a Severe Master, let him meet with
never so many Evil things in this
World, who hath a Sure and Certain
Hope of <hi>Ere long</hi> Receiving such Good
things, as <hi>Pass all Vnderstanding:</hi> As
<hi>the Eye of Man never saw, nor his
Ear ever heard, nor his Heart is able
to Conceive</hi> any <hi>like</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>It must needs make this <hi>Vale of
Tears,</hi> not only a Tolerable but a
Pleasant Place, to Consider, that at
the End thereof is the <hi>Mount of Ioy:
Of Ioy Vnspeakable and full of Glory.</hi>
And that these (comparatively speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
<hi>Light Afflictions which are but
for a Moment, will work out for us</hi>
(if we are not inexcusably wanting
to our selves) <hi>a far more exceeding
and Eternal weight of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I infer, How unreasonable
it is, to have the lower and more
undervaluing thoughts of the Divine
Goodness and Beneficence, and the
less Sense of our Obligations to God,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61714:67"/>
in regard of the <hi>Evils</hi> wherewith
our Good things are mixed, and our
Earthly Comforts are allayed. The
great unreasonableness hereof will
appear by the following Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
over and above <hi>those</hi> we have
been presented with from the words
of the Text.</p>
            <p>I. Very many, and perhaps the
incomparably greater part of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
we suffer, are not from the <hi>mere,</hi>
or <hi>immediate</hi> Providence of God. It
is Certain, that innumerable are of
Mens <hi>own</hi> inflicting upon themselves.
And not only <hi>deserved</hi> by them, but
also the necessary Effects of their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or of their Inadvertency.</p>
            <p>We will take <hi>Poverty</hi> for one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
For the <hi>most</hi> part, we may
well adventure to say, Men fall into
it from Plentiful Fortunes, through
their wicked or foolish wasting their
Estates; by either Spending them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Lusts, or their rash Engaging
for Non-Solvent Persons, or their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providence,
Idleness and Mindlesness
of their Business. Where <hi>one</hi> is brought
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61714:67"/>
to great Want, by the <hi>mere</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, our observation I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
will tell us of <hi>Many,</hi> who ought
to impute it to <hi>themselves</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Sickness</hi> be another Instance.
Men, for Certain, do ordinarily fall
into Diseases, by doing what they
<hi>ought not</hi> to do, or neglecting what
they <hi>ought</hi> to do, and for want of
due Care and Caution.</p>
            <p>From whence do too Commonly
the Tormenting Diseases of the Gout
and <hi>Stone,</hi> and the <hi>Dropsy</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi>
come, but from mens offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as to the Quantity or Quality of
their Liquors; or from such other
Causes as by a greater <hi>Care</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
might have been Prevented?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feavers</hi> are some of the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Diseases, but are they not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
Occasioned, either by some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance
in Meats or Drinks, or
Exercise; or unseasonable Drinking
when <hi>Over hot,</hi> or not taking care to
cool by <hi>degrees,</hi> and the like? And
I am per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>waded, that in reflecting
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61714:68"/>
upon the Causes of our Sicknesses of
<hi>most</hi> kinds, there are few of us who
are not sensible, that they were the
<hi>natural</hi> Consequents of some Sin or
Imprudence or other, much more
frequently, than of that which was
wholly unavoidable.</p>
            <p>Except in the Case of the <hi>Airs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infected with Pestilential or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Vapours, we have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to think, that the much greater
Number are laid upon <hi>Sick Beds</hi> by the
Ordinary Maladies, through some
Neglect of their Health; and therefore
that there may be no more than the
<hi>Permissive</hi> Hand of God in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deprived thereof.</p>
            <p>When we suffer in our <hi>Reputation,</hi>
or otherways, from the <hi>Ill will</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
ought we not too often to thank
our selves for not being so Cautious,
as we should have been, of giving
them Offence; and to impute it at
least to Inconsideration and Rashness
as to some Actions or Words, which
gave occasion more or less, to their
being provoked against us?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:61714:68"/>
Those that suffer from the <hi>Misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
or Vndutifulness of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
(which must needs be, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to <hi>Good</hi> Men, the greatest of all
Afflictions) are they not, for the most
part, too well aware, that these suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
are in a great measure owing
to <hi>themselves;</hi> and that they might
have had much better Children, if
they had set them a better Example,
and given them better Education?</p>
            <p>And I need not add, that the <hi>same</hi>
is to be said, in reference to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, of <hi>those</hi> Afflictions
which do arise from our Sympathy
with those in Affliction, who are dear
to us, when <hi>they</hi> suffer through their
own default.</p>
            <p>And the same thing is to be asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of <hi>those</hi> Evils, which we have
not brought upon our selves, but are
occasioned by the Faults of our <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi>
or of <hi>such</hi> as whose Interests
and Concerns, are necessarily linked
together with <hi>ours;</hi> so that the <hi>one</hi>
cannot suffer, but the <hi>other</hi> also must.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61714:69"/>
As when a Man lives in Penury,
by means of his Fathers disabling
himself by his Prodigality, Sin, or
Folly, to leave him a Subsistence.
Or when a Trades-man is made a
Bankrupt by <hi>his</hi> means, whom he
hath taken into Partnership. Or
when Parents, having by Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Marred their own Bodies, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
their Constitutions, Propagate
their Diseases or Weaknesses, to the
Children which are afterwards born
of them.</p>
            <p>Now I say, there is nothing more
Unreasonable, than to think God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
the <hi>less</hi> Good, in regard of
<hi>such</hi> Evils as those now mentioned.</p>
            <p>And if it be well Considered, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
I say, doubt but that <hi>most</hi> of those
which Men complain of, are of that
nature.</p>
            <p>And what would we have God to
do, to keep off such Evils as <hi>these?</hi>
Would we have him to be continually
laying irresistible Restreints upon <hi>Free</hi>
Agents, so as that it shall be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61714:69"/>
for them at any time to do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
or at any time to act fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly?
If we think that <hi>this</hi> would
well become Him, we must think at
the same time, that to <hi>make Free</hi>
Agents did <hi>disbecome</hi> Him. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
such Agents so left to the <hi>Use</hi>
of their Liberty, as not to be so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
from either Sinning, or playing
the Fools, as that they <hi>can</hi> not do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the foresaid and such like Evils
will necessarily follow from the <hi>Abuse</hi>
thereof. And therefore far be it from
us, to have the lower opinion of the
Divine Goodness upon the account of
them.</p>
            <p>But I ought to add (in order to
our having a just Sense of Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that it may lose nothing of
the Honour <hi>due</hi> to it) that He doth
innumerable times prevent by <hi>Special</hi>
Providences, our running into those
Sins, and those Rash Actions, which
we should most Certainly have <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi>
been guilty of. And He doth
frequently (and possibly <hi>as</hi> often) in
a Secret invisible manner, so Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61714:70"/>
               <hi>Natural</hi> Causes of Evils, as to
prevent their producing them, when
they were ready to do it. Not only
History, but many of our Own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
do furnish us with great
Proofs hereof. And if <hi>these</hi> Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were not <hi>both</hi> true, it is not
imaginable but that <hi>this</hi> world would
be a far more intolerable Place than
it is, Considering how it Abounds
with Wickedness, and how Corrupt
Human Nature is in this lapsed State,
and what Foolish &amp; Heady Creatures
the Generality of Mankind are, and
what Dangers we are always Encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
with. And the <hi>worst</hi> objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
we can make against Almighty
God, for not always thus interposing,
is, that He will not have His Goodness
in any one instance, to thwart and
contradict that <hi>Wisdom</hi> by which He
Governs the World.</p>
            <p>But suppose we <hi>waved</hi> the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Divine <hi>Wisdom</hi> in the
Case, what Reason can we have to
complain of God's deficiency in <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
because He is not more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to keep Evils off from us, than
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61714:70"/>
we <hi>our selves</hi> are? 'Tis certain, He
is much <hi>more</hi> concerned for <hi>our</hi> Good
than <hi>we</hi> can be, and <hi>sad</hi> would it be
for us, if He were not; but suppose
Him onely <hi>equally</hi> so, we should not
have cause to think Him wanting to
us, but should see great Reason to
Admire His Goodness; considering
that <hi>He</hi> is infinitely Above even the
Glorious <hi>Angels,</hi> and can get nothing
by <hi>any</hi> of <hi>His</hi> Creatures being Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
nor lose any thing by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Miserable.</p>
            <p>II. Let us <hi>next</hi> Consider, That, as
Abundance of the Evils which men
groan under, are not from the <hi>mere</hi>
or <hi>immediate</hi> Providence of God, so
<hi>very many</hi> things which we are apt to
account Evils, and are matter of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
to us, are <hi>not</hi> Evils. That
<hi>Stoical Maxim, Mens Minds are not
troubled with Things, but with the
False Opinions they have of Things,</hi>
would be very true, if it ran <hi>thus,
Mens Minds are not</hi> so much <hi>troubled
with Things,</hi> &amp;c. For there are a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of things which greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61714:71"/>
men, which are onely Evils of
their own making; and which they
would make exceeding light of, would
they govern themselves more by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
than by fond Phansy, and the
Childish Opinions of <hi>other</hi> Folk.</p>
            <p>To have nothing of Superfluity, but
a bare Competency, how many are
there who account <hi>this</hi> a great Evil!
Tho' the Apostle saith, <hi>Having Food
and Rayment, let us be therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi>
And we have a good Old Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Nature is content with a little,
and Grace with less.</hi> How many lay
it to heart, as a grievous thing, to
be necessitated to Earn their Bread
with the Sweat of their Brows; nay
not to be able to make such a Figure
among their Neighbours, as divers of
them do! And thereupon they take
but slight Notice of the innumerable
great Mercies which they enjoy; and
instead of being thankful for them,
murmur at the Divine Providence,
because they have not all they <hi>would</hi>
have.</p>
            <p>But as God Almighty asked the
peevish Prophet, Whether <hi>he did well
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61714:71"/>
to be Angry?</hi> I ask <hi>these,</hi> Whether
they <hi>do well to be discontented,</hi> and to
have so little Sense of the Bounty of
their Great Benefactor? For (not to
mind them again, that <hi>whatsoever</hi> the
Good things are which they enjoy,
they are more than He <hi>oweth</hi> them,
or than their Deserts can claim)
they ought to consider, that the <hi>whole
World</hi> is God's Charge, and not only
some particular Persons; and that His
Goodness expresseth its self by so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning
His Blessings to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
as shall be most for the good of
the Whole: And that it would be
extremely ill for the Whole, for <hi>all</hi>
to be alike Sharers in His Good things.</p>
            <p>And it is necessary for the Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
of the whole, that there should
be a great Variety of Ranks and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Men: By which means, all
necessary Offices have People sitted
for them.</p>
            <p>And, withal, they ought to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that if it be necessary that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
should be in low Circumstances,
for the performance of the lower and
meaner Offices, which yet are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61714:72"/>
whit as necessary as the higher,
what Reason can they give, why
<hi>themselves</hi> should not be in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those many? And whether, for
the same Reason that they would be
placed in one of the higher Orbs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
body else may not expect it?
<hi>Self-love</hi> is the onely Reason, why
<hi>They</hi> would be so, but why may not
<hi>Every</hi> man Love himself, as well as
<hi>they</hi> love themselves?</p>
            <p>They ought to consider too, that
at <hi>this</hi> rate there could be no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them. For tho' God should still
Humour them, in giving them their
desires, it would but make them rise,
still higher and higher in their Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.</p>
            <p>It is an Unquestionable Truth, that
Contentment is not to be fetched from
<hi>without,</hi> but from an inward good
Frame and Temper of Mind. And
therefore we find, that those who are
in High Places, are not the <hi>most</hi> but
the <hi>least</hi> Contented; are far more
Ambitious of Rising still Higher, than
those who are in the very <hi>lowest.</hi> And
for the same Reason, he, who being
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61714:72"/>
in a Low Condition, is discontented
because he is not in an higher, will
never be satisfied till he gets to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Top;</hi> nor then neither.</p>
            <p>So that, if thy being without such
or such Good things, may Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be a matter of Complaint, or
cause an Abatement of Gratitude,
thou canst never be put into such Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
as where in thou wilt see
cause to be very Thankful, or not to
Complain.</p>
            <p>And I add, that it is highly Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of an Infinitely Good God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of being Repugnant to His Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to make such feel <hi>real</hi> Evils, who
frame to themselves so many Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Ones: To make those Sufferers
in <hi>good earnest,</hi> who complain of such
things as Evils, which are <hi>not</hi> so, but
at <hi>worst</hi> in a less degree Good things:
And to bring Heavy Afflictions on
those, who make by their Discontent
Light Ones Heavy.</p>
            <p>III. Consider that, as you want
those Good things which many have,
so Abundance of those who enjoy
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61714:73"/>
those things, do want others that <hi>you</hi>
have. How many that have great
Estates, and Honourable Titles, are
destitute of some of the most <hi>Common</hi>
Mercies; by which means they are
able to take but little Content, in all
their Grandeur! And by which
means, Thousands of the Meanest
People, would be very unwilling to
change Conditions with them. And
who knows not, that the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Blessings, are the most Valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?</p>
            <p>What <hi>Beggar</hi> would lose his <hi>Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,</hi>
to be a <hi>Lord?</hi> Who would
change his Cottage for a Palace, if he
must give his Health and his Ease into
the Bargain? Who would not rather
chuse to sleep sweetly upon <hi>Straw,</hi>
than to lye Crying out under the
Stone or Gout, upon a Bed of <hi>Ivory?</hi>
What Wise Man would not rather
Eat Course Fare with a good Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and Appetite, than to be serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Great Variety of Choice
Dishes, and unable to Digest one of
them without Wine, or Relish one
of them without Sauces?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:61714:73"/>
Nay, if we understood what Crosses
and Vexations of innumerable kinds,
do attend great Estates, and what
Dangers High Places are surrounded
with, we should greatly pity very
Rich and Great Men, instead of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
them; and think our selves
far more Happy with a quiet and a
safe Competency.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more plainly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
than that ordinarily the
Meanest Servants of Great People, do
enjoy more satisfaction, than their
Lords or Ladies.</p>
            <p>So that put all things together,
tho' there be a vast difference between
Men and Men in their external Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
there is but very little
difference between them, as to their
partaking of the Divine Beneficence.</p>
            <p>No Man enjoys <hi>all</hi> Good things,
and 'tis commonly seen that he who
falls short of another in <hi>some,</hi> as much
excells him in <hi>Others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. Consider how prone we are,
to make the Good things God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
us with, Evils to <hi>our selves,</hi> and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61714:74"/>
the <hi>greatest</hi> Evils. That is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
our Temporal Good things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Spiritual Evil things; and to make
them more Mischievous to our Souls,
than it is possible they should be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to our Outward Man.</p>
            <p>And, as we are all very <hi>prone</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
so, are not most Men <hi>actually</hi> so
much the more High-minded, Vain,
Covetous and Sensual, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by how
much the more they Abound in Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Blessings? And therefore is God ever
the less Good to men, in either <hi>depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
them of those Good things they
so Abuse, or in <hi>Withholding</hi> many
such from <hi>those,</hi> whom He knows
would be in very great <hi>Danger</hi> of
Abusing them, if they had them?</p>
            <p>V. Consider how many do make
little Conscience of <hi>doing Evil</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
of making them Sufferers in
one respect or other: And how many
of those, who would not be thought
Unjust or Cruel, can find in their
hearts to be Severe and Rigid. And
how many that are <hi>better</hi> Natured
and better Principled than such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61714:74"/>
are nothing so inclined to Pity the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
and Distressed, as they ought to be;
nor to Concern themselves to keep off Evils
from their Brethren, or to Ease them of them,
according to their Power.</p>
            <p>Now with what <hi>Face</hi> can such Expect,
that God Almighty should be so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ender of
<hi>those,</hi> either in Preventing the lighting of
Evils upon them, or in taking them off,
when ever they would have Him, who are
either Harsh to, or so little Tender of their
Fellow-Christians, or Fellow-Creatures?</p>
            <p>How doth it Dis-become the Goodness of
God, to say to such, <hi>With what Measure
you Mete, it shall be Meted to you again?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>Wretched</hi> People then are they, who
Complain of God, for Shewing no more Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to <hi>them,</hi> who have no more Mercy for
<hi>others;</hi> and that will have Him to be the less
Good upon this account! Since it is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to His Goodness, to Abandon such
to Extreme Sufferings, but an Act most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of His Justice.</p>
            <p>VI. It may be Considered too, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Evils which befall us, others do
Gain more by than the Sufferers lose; &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
God is more Gracious to others in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61714:75"/>
them, than He is Severe to those who Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
by them. We use to say, <hi>That is an
Ill Wind, which blows no body good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>as</hi> we have shewed, that God designs
Mens <hi>own</hi> Good in their Sufferings, be they
never so bad, provided they have not Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themselves past Recovery by Afflictions;
and that all that improve them as they ought,
do reap great Advantage by them, especially
Spiritual Advantage, so hath He Contrived
things in so Wise a manner, as that we are
Mutually Advantaged by one anothers Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.
There may be given a <hi>Thousand</hi>
Instances of <hi>this</hi> nature, and therefore it is
needless to give <hi>any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, He that would take a Measure of the
Divine Goodness, by what happeneth to <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
Considered as a <hi>Being</hi> Separate from the
Rest of Mankind, must be so <hi>Silly</hi> as to think
at the same time, that God hath no Body to
be Concerned for besides <hi>Himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, take we along with <hi>these</hi> Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
what hath been Discoursed of the <hi>Few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of our Evil things, in Comparison of
our Good things: And of our <hi>Non-desert</hi>
of the least Good things, but our <hi>High de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert</hi>
of the Greatest Evils: And of the <hi>Need</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:61714:75"/>
we all have of Evil things: And of Evil
things being appointed us by God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
from the <hi>Self-same Principle</hi> that Good
things are; I say, Let <hi>these</hi> accompany our
last mentioned Considerations, and <hi>then,</hi> if
we are <hi>Able,</hi> let us think it a Tolerable
thing to Repine at any of God's Dealings
with us; or to <hi>Cease to Praise</hi> Him, and to
have a Thankful Sense of our Obligations
to Him, under even the <hi>Sharpest</hi> Tryals.
<hi>Then</hi> let us think, if we <hi>can,</hi> that <hi>that</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> may be <hi>sometimes</hi>
Unseasonable, <hi>viz. Praise the Lord; for it
is Good to Sing Praises unto our God: For it
is Pleasant, and Praise is Comely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If, after <hi>all</hi> that hath now been Offered
to our Consideration, we can perswade our
selves <hi>thus</hi> to think, we must Blame holy
<hi>Iob</hi> for being so offended as his <hi>Wife's Taunt,
Bless God and Dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, in the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> I must Repeat
what hath been already Suggested, and which
Sad <hi>Experience</hi> assures us of, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is
far more easie to Satisfie our Reason, than
to bring our Passions under the Government
thereof; and especially in reference to the
Bearing of Afflictions. And therefore there
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61714:76"/>
is an Absolute Necessity of adding, to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Considerations we are furnished with
to Strengthen us under them, our Frequent,
Humble, and most Importunate Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> that we may
not under the Afflicting Hand of God, be so
Over-Power'd with Melancholy, as to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to think a Wise Thought; and to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
so to fix our Minds upon Such Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
as that they may make an Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Impression; and that we may have Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
suitable to our Burdens; without which,
let us Exercise our Thinking Faculty as well
as we can, we shall be <hi>as Weak as Water.</hi>
And they were great <hi>Divine</hi> Supports to
which <hi>Iob</hi> was above <hi>all</hi> beholden; or he
had never Behaved himself as he did, under
Such Mighty Calamities; nor <hi>particularly</hi>
given so brave a Reply to his Wifes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Speech, as, <q>What? Shall we receive
Good at the Hand of God, and shall we not
receive Evil?</q>
            </p>
