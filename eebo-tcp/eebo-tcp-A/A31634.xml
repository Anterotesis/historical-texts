            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OBJECTIONS
Sometimes Made againſt the

            <head type="sub">Fully Anſwered.</head>
            <p>Objection I.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THat 'tis not practicable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 'Tis already practiſed ſeperately in its Parts, as in
Lumbards and Banks beyond Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> 2. 'Tis, becauſe it may be ſecurely dealt with, as, <hi>V. Obj.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>3. That 'tis very probable, Cuſtomers will come to this <hi>Office,</hi> as well as
they do here to <hi>Bankers, Scriveners,</hi> and <hi>Broakers,</hi> and beyond Sea, to <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi>
and the rather, becauſe of the Publick Security, and the Credit of the
Citty's Care and Inſpection, better than the Reputation of any of the former:
and alfo by reaſon they are ſupplyed here at much lower Rates.</p>
            <p>4. That the <hi>Credit</hi> raiſed upon Goods may be transferred as well as it is
in the <hi>Banks</hi> beyond Sea, and without doubt, will be as acceptable; ſince
the only Reaſon why it paſſeth Currant there, i<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe there is a Pledge
left in a ſecure Place; and ſo there will be here with Advantage.</p>
            <p>5. There was more reaſon to have doubted the paſſing of <hi>Credit</hi> at the
firſt Conſtitution of Banks, when there was nothing in the known World
like it: than now, having Examples before us of Forreign <hi>Banks,</hi> and Home-<hi>Bankers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41991:2"/>
6. What is already practiſed in other Countries, is Practicable here, as
<hi>Lumbards</hi> and <hi>Banks.</hi> For Goods can be brought by the Proprietor, received,
regiſtred, and ſecurely repoſited by the Undertakers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in <hi>Lumbards;</hi> and
the Depoſitor, for the value of them, can be entred <hi>Creditor</hi> and <hi>Debtor,</hi> as
they are for the value of Money in <hi>Bank,</hi> and ſo can it be transferred. In all
this, there is no ſuch <hi>Herculian</hi> Labour. <hi>Vide Lex Mercat. pag. 73. Regiſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Objection II. <hi>That there is no need of this</hi> Office, <hi>becauſe there is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Money and Trade enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. There cannot be too much Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. That there is want of Money, is evident by the decay of Trade,
and want of Employment for at leaſt half the People of the Nation, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
whereof we have in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which abounds with Native Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and yet hath no conſiderable Trade for want of Money or Currant Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
equivalent, and though ſome men, becauſe of their great Credit, may
have what money they pleaſe, yet they cannot but find, by dealing with
ſeveral (that either pay them not punctually, or not at all) that Money is
wanting. The ſtanding Debts in this Nation (where men are willing to
pay, and rich in Goods, or content to be employed, though idle) are
clear Demonſtrations that there is not Money enough to anſwer all Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
which would appear more plainly, if every Man in <hi>London,</hi> who hath
10000 <hi>l.</hi> Credit upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> ſhould deſire ſo much Money together.</p>
            <p>3 If there were ten times as much Trade as now there is, the People
would be ten times richer than now they are: and by the help of this <hi>Office,</hi>
and the quick Returns occaſioned by it, Trade will be ſo much increaſed:
For let us have never ſo many natural or manufactured Commodities,
one Country or other will want them, and take them off our hands, ſo
that there is no fear, that by the Increaſe of Trade, Merchants and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
growing innumerable, will not be able to live one by another; nor yet
will the reſort of People to Cities and Places of great Trade, bring with it
that ſcarcity of Proviſions apprehended by ſome men: for the largeneſs of
Trade doth not multiply men in the World, though it doth in the Place of
Trade, to which, Proviſions (eſpecially when they have the help of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable
River) will flow from all Parts at as cheap a Rate as before; when
by the Removal of Perſons to trading Towns, the Conſumption muſt needs
be leſs in thoſe Parts from whence they come.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Office</hi> therefore (the Credit whereof will be as the adding of ſo
much Money to the Nation) will be a certain meanes to increaſe its Trade,
and conſequently enrich it: And the Credit there delivered out, will firſt
or laſt find its way back for the Redemption of Goods, and in the mean
time ſerves Mens Occaſions as well as ready Money.</p>
            <p>5. 'Twere worth the knowing how many there are, that have ſo much
money, that they know not what to do with more, if they had it? If there be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41991:2"/>
few or none ſuch, then ſurely this <hi>Office</hi> may be neceſſary; for it can enable a
man by the uſe of it, to deal for ſix times, or at leaſt, double, what he is worth,
and yet never be truſted. As ſuppoſe a <hi>Silk-man</hi> be worth a thouſand pound,
with which he buys <hi>Silk,</hi> he brings this into the <hi>Office,</hi> and raiſeth 9/10 of the
worth, which is nine hundred pound; or more, or leſs, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Commodity, with which he buys again from the ſame <hi>Merchant</hi>
more, and brings that alſo to the <hi>Office</hi> to raiſe Credit, and ſo one upon the
other, according to theſe following Examples.</p>
            <p>The Rule of the <hi>Office</hi> being, for the moſt part, to Lend ¾ 9/10 or ½.</p>

            <p>By which 'its evident, that this Silkman may multiply his ſtock to 7160 <hi>l.</hi>
without ever being Credited, for the Merchant is paid in credit which is
currant, and the Silkman, as faſt as he can get a Chapman, may either ſell at
his Shop, or the Office: where the whole charge after Six <hi>per Cent. p. an.</hi>
comes for a half year to <hi>210 l.</hi> if no part were in that time ſold, and his gains
at 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> the uſual gain comes to <hi>716 l.</hi> where his gain would without
this help, have been but <hi>100 l.</hi> after the ſame rate. Beſides this hinders him
not from buying half upon credit, and then his ſtock would have been 14322 <hi>l.</hi>
and his gains proportionable: Or ſuppoſe leſs credit were lent out of the
Office, taking one commodity with another, according to the firſt and
third examples, it does trible or double the principal ſtock. There is likewiſe
added a fourth example of a ſmaller ſum (upon which 90 in the hundred is
lent) that the vulgar capacities may the better underſtand the advantage
and profit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41991:3"/>
We muſt note that a man is obliged neither to buy alwayes from the ſame
Merchant, nor the ſame commodities, but from whom and what he pleaſeth,
the Credit being Currant.</p>
            <p>But thoſe Objectors take this aſſertion for granted, becauſe they and ſome
they know, have no want of either Money or Trade, which is a deceitful
Calculation. For, 1. If there were never ſo little Money, and bad Trade, yet
ſome would fare well enough, though the fewer.</p>
            <p>2. If there were Moneyes and Trade enough, I ſuppoſe thoſe overſtockt
Merchants would not meet ſo often with bad Debts, and delatory payments,
as hath been uſual.</p>
            <p>3. The failing of ſo many Houſe-keepers, ſeems to prove, that either
there is leſs Money, or a greater quantity of Men to uſe it, and ſo leſſe falls to
every ones ſhare, which is unavoidable, unleſſe that Money encreaſed as faſt
as Men, or prevented by this expedient, which (though Men and Goods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
<hi>ad infinitum)</hi> can accommodate them all with Credit, which anſwers
all the uſes and advantages of Money.</p>
            <p>4. Notwithſtanding the generallity of men, through prudence or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
contract their expences, yet grow they never the richer, but rather
poorer: For as all men contract their expences, ſo every Tradeſ-man muſt
neceſſarily receive leſſe, and then the Commodities lie the longer in the
Merchants hands. So that, where there is a leſſe conſumption of In-land
and Forraign Commodities, and a decreaſe of moſt mens profits and gains,
we muſt needs conclude, the Money of the Nation is diminiſhed, or that
ſome rich Miſer hoards it up to look on. For, if it were in the Uſurers hands,
it would, upon good Security, be ſent abroad again.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, Though there be the ſame ſtock of Money, but a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Commodities than uſually imported, Money being the <hi>Medium,</hi> they
muſt needs ly dead, till it can go round. For as an hundred yards of cloth
requires longer time to be meaſured with one yard than 10 yards, ſo doth
much and many Comodities require a longer time to have the ſame quantity
of money anſwer it, than fewer, and it will ſooner run through ten mens
hands than twenty.</p>
            <p>But the infallible ſigne of plenty of Money, and a flouriſhing Trade, is,
when multitudes have great dealing, and every man that is willing to work
be full of employment; which how far theſe preſent times come ſhort off,
let the underſtanding Reader judge.</p>
            <p>By the help of this Office, if all the Commodities of <hi>Europe</hi> were brought
in, there could be no ceſſation of Trade, for the credit of one Commodity,
would ſtill meaſure and purchaſe another; and what could not be ſpent in
<hi>England,</hi> might then, by the credit of other Commodities, be tranſported to
other Countreys to find a Market; which now, for want of Money to anſwer
it, lies rotting here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41991:3"/>
But the moſt pertinent Anſwer is, that it will ſoon be decided, whether
there be need of this Office, or no? For if there be no need of it, it will have
no cuſtomers, and if it have cuſtomers, it will be an undeniable argument,
that there is need of it. <hi>Vide Lex Mercat. p. 48. pargr. 4. &amp; p. 53. par.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Objection. 3. <hi>That 'twill be a</hi> Monopoly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. None; For all men are free to uſe it, and none prohibited to
imitate it, if they can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 2. All Eſtabliſhed Offices are <hi>Monopolies</hi> as much as this, for they
cannot run through the hands of all Perſons, but only of the peculiar Officers,
and ſeveral ſuch Offices have been found of great Utility, as the <hi>Penny-Poſt</hi>
for a late Example. But this is far from a <hi>Monopoly</hi> in a bad ſenſe; for that
is only grievous by engroſſing a neceſſary Commodity into few hands with
a purpoſe to inhance the Price, which was formerly better and cheaper ſold
by many; but this Office debaſeth the Price, and inables more men to Trade,
and for more than without it.</p>
            <p>That which is voluntary, and reſtrains no man of his Freedom or Liberty,
cannot be a <hi>Monopoly;</hi> but this is voluntary, and therefore if it be not
found to be for the Publick Good, it will ſoon fall.</p>
            <p>Objection 4. <hi>That the Office will be endangered by Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. It is morally impoſſible for Fire to hurt it, for there will be all
imaginable Care taken to prevent it, but he that obſerves the Wind, ſhall
never fow; and he that forbears any great Undertakings for fear of Caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ſhall never perform any thing conſiderable: Nor is this <hi>Objection</hi> of
more Force againſt this Office, than it is againſt <hi>Blackwell-Hall,</hi> and other
Ware-houſes and Store-houſes.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis like the Goods may be enſured to ſuch as deſire it, and will be at
the Charge.</p>
            <p>3. And here they will be ſafer from Fire than in the Proprietors own Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion;
by how much the value of the Whole is greater than of any part, and
conſequently greater Care and Charge, and a more peculiar Accomodation
for their Preſervation, than in ordinary Ware-houſes.</p>
            <p>Objection 5. <hi>That there cannot be ſufficient Security to anſwer the Truſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41991:4"/>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. More than ſufficient Security, for all are under Bonds, and
muſt all agree to deceive, or 'twill be diſappointed by thoſe that do not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Security can only be expected for the Fidelity of the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
for the Goods depoſited, make them able; and a ſmall Proportion of
Honeſty and Diſcretion, may qualifie men to be truſted with the Care of
keeping other mens Goods, and returning them to the right Owners; nor
indeed are the Undertakers truſted ſo much as the Goods themſelves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they are only the Keepers.</p>
            <p>3. If any man diſtruſts this <hi>Bank,</hi> and thereupon returns the <hi>Credit</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and defrays all Charges, he may take out his Goods when it pleaſeth
himſelf.</p>
            <p>4. No one of the Undertakers hath power to meddle with Goods, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than according to the Rules conſtituted by the whole Society, and it
were too fevere to think that the whole Society of Undertakers would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
together to run away with their ſeveral Families, and convey away ſo
great a Magazine of ſeveral Goods, nor is it poſſible to be attempted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
notice ſufficient to hinder ſuch a Deſign.</p>
            <p>5. It is the Intereſt of the Undertakers to be honeſt and induſtrious, to
ſupport the Credit of this Office; to the Accompliſhment of which, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,
is the only Expedient whereby alſo they will get ten times more than
they can expect by diſhoneſty; and this Conſideration will bind them more
than the ſtrongeſt Bonds or Judgments, as we ſee by Experience in private
Perſons; <hi>Goldſmiths,</hi> and others; and in this Caſe, the Undertakers, Credits,
Eſtates, and Stocks in Warehouſes, with other neceſſaries belonging to this
<hi>Office</hi> (which will all lye lyable) will ſufficiently obliege them to prevent
any Dammage that may come to the Goods in Depoſit, or to the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
thereof, and whatever happens, will be ſufficient to make Reſtitution
in caſe of Embezelments; ſo that none can be thought to be more upon
good Behaviour than this Society.</p>
            <p>6. Great Security is neceſſary for the <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> becauſe the
Foundation is Money, which may eaſily be conveyed away, and is every
where acceptable, but 'tis otherwiſe with Goods, whoſe Bulk makes it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to convey any conſiderable quantity of them away.</p>
            <p>7. The Office in <hi>London</hi> will be placed under the Inſpection of the Lord
Mayor; and in other Corporations, under the Inſpection of the Mayors, or
Head-Officers there and of ſuch as they appoint under them, whoſe Care will
be to prevent the Embezelling of Goods brought in, and the iſſuing more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41991:4"/>
Credit than the Goods in the Office can anſwer, ſo that they who bring in
Goods cannot be defrauded, nor they damnified that receive the Credit.
And Checks, as well as Inſpectors, will be appointed and choſen by every
Corporation where this Office ſhall be erected, to ſee that none of the
Goods be Embezelled, or converted to the private uſe of the Undertakers:
ſo that in effect here will be Check upon Check, for the Undertaker is Check
or Truſtee between the Proprietor and Poſſeſſor of Credit, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Check or Truſtee, is between the Undertaker, Proprietor, and
Poſſeſſon.</p>
            <p>8. Great Care and Proviſion ſhall be likewiſe made, and the ſame as in
Forreign <hi>Lumbards</hi> (which is greater and better commonly, than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors
themſelves me) againſt Fire, Thieves, Waſting, and ſpoiling of
Goods by <hi>Rats, Mice, Mould, Mildew, Moths, Duſt,</hi> and ſuch like Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;
and for the better ſatisfaction of the ſeveral Corporations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors,
the <hi>Porters</hi> who are to attend the Office, and watch every Night
by turn, ſhall be approved by their Reſpective Corporations.</p>
            <p>9. All the Officers give the City ſufficient Security, according to their
Truſt.</p>
            <p>10. The Proprietors of the Goods, and Poſſeſſors of the Credit, will in
a manner be themſelves the Inſpecters and Keepers of the Goods, and will,
or may dayly reſort to them; ſo that 'tis very unlikely that there can be
any deſign of Embezelling them, but what will be diſcovered, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
prevented as ſoon as attempted.</p>
            <p>11. Few mens occaſions will let this Credit lodge above a Week in their
Hands, and there will be no reaſon to fear loſs from what paſſes ſo Currant
and quick.</p>
            <p>12. The Credit Currant will always come ſhort of the Intrinſick value of
the Goods engaged, for there will be ſtill more Goods in the Office, than
Credit abroad, ſo that this Office can never be truſted for more than 'tis
worth; which prevents all poſſibility of Loſs that way. And though this
be otherwiſe in the <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the Credit of which is known far
to exceed the value of the Money upon which it is founded; yet we ſee 'tis
truſted, becauſe of its Conveniency: Much rather then may this Office be
truſted, being ſettled upon a ſurer Foundation, and much more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
            <p>13. 'Tis more reaſonable to truſt a Society than any private perſon, and yet
we ſee truſting of private Perſons, runs through all manner of Trades; the
Merchant &amp; Whole-ſale-Dealer truſts his Chapman, the Retailer his Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers;
nay, we ſee dayly ſeveral ſorts of Perſons truſted with far more than
they are worth, as Maſters of Ships, Factors, Broakers, Jaylers, but above all,
Goldſmiths, and Bankers, with vaſt Summs of Money, Jewels, and Plate, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of which are men of no Fortunes. And (if theſe private Perſons are to be

               <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hus truſted, who may at any time with their ſingle Families, and the Effects
they have in their hands, which conſiſt of ſuch portable and acceptable
Commodities, readily withdraw themſelves, or may dye, and leave Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
from whom little ſatisfaction is commonly to be had) much more a
Society compoſed of Perſons of equal and greater Reputations and Eſtates;
nor can the Society dye (as particular Perſons) but will always have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies
ſupplyed. And it may be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Prudence, Honour, and Honeſty, as well as Intereſt, which make
thoſe private Perſons true and faithful to their Truſt, will have at leaſt as
great an influence upon this Society.</p>
            <p>14. The ſeveral Hands and Checks (which appear in the Printed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals)
that theſe Goods ly under, and muſt paſs through, if legally trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
ſecures them againſt any Breach of Truſt in them.</p>
            <p>And the Difficulty and almoſt Impoſſibility of their being Embezeled
and ſtoln by the Servants that keep and watch them, and the Exchange of
the Gallows for a ſufficient livelihood by their Salaryes in their ſeveral Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
will certainly (beſides very great Security which they all do
give to the City for their Truth and Honeſty) ſecure them againſt thieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and purloyning.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt Security, and which muſt ſatisfie all underſtanding men,
is, that if it were poſſible for the Undertakers, or any Perſons to Purloine,
or Embezeled the Goods, you muſt ſuppoſe them greater Fools than Knaves,
the Revenue and Profit ariſing by the Fund, being too great to ſatisfie even
the moſt covetous Deſires, becauſe they cannot convey away before Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and Prevention, the tenth part of what they'l gain by a faithful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their Truſt.</p>
            <p>15. The Intereſt of the Undertakers, or at leaſt their Bonds, will make
them honeſt, and their Cuſtomers will make them able.</p>
            <p>And if any man hath a Jealouſie that he is wronged, either in his Goods
or Credit, he can immediately examine, and if he believes himſelf injured,
let him inſtantly enter his Complaint, and upon proof, ſhall receive from
the Office preſent Redreſs, as before mentioned, or elſe he may take his
Remedy at Law againſt the Whole, or any part of the Society.</p>
            <p>Objection 6. <hi>That the People will not readily apprehend a Benefit from this
Office, underſtanding nothing but Money; to which they have been accuſtomed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Granted, till by the Practice they come to feel it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 2. Practice will ſooner convince men of this Errour, than Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
can; only this may be added, that as the People will find this trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
of Credit a far more eaſie way than Payment by Money, ſo where
Money is deſired, there will be enough that will lay it down, and take the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41991:5"/>
Credit of the Office for it; and to that purpoſe there will be Bank-Broakers
conſtituted.</p>
            <p>Objection 7. <hi>This Office will bring Money out of uſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Not in the leaſt, for 'twill make more currant, by bringing
much in uſe, which now lyes by.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis granted in ſome caſes, but in thoſe we can ſerve our ſelves better
without it, but then it will increaſe <hi>Plate</hi> and <hi>Jewels,</hi> becauſe we can upon
all occaſion, without loſs of Faſhon, or Propriety, make them currant to
ſerve our neceſſities.</p>
            <p>3. This coyns no more Credit than is needed, ſo that it will not at all
abrogate the uſe of the preſent Money, which will be uſed as much as ever
before.</p>
            <p>Objection 8. <hi>That the Warrs abroad may obſtruct Trade, and ſo hinder the
good intended, for why ſhould men ſeek to increaſe Commodities at home, when
they may not find Vent abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may partake of the Fate of the Kingdom, and be Injured, but never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. The only neceſſity of a Forreign Trade for <hi>England,</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we make a Forreign Commodity <hi>(Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver)</hi> the Standard of
all ours, and the only Medium of Commerce, which (as long as it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
ſo) if we want, all Trades muſt ceaſe; but if we can find out another
and ſafer Medium of Exchange (as this <hi>Credit)</hi> appropriated to the place
where we live, and not ſubject to ſuch Obſtruction as the other, why ſhould
we not readily embrace it.</p>
            <p>2. If we ſell no Commodities abroad, we ſhall buy none thence, and the
leſs we ſpend of Forreign, the more we ſhall of In-land, and ſo be wealthy
in our Domeſtick Commodities, though we are not rich in the other. And
if there be any ſuch Obſtructions in our Forreign Trade, we have plenty of
<hi>Lead</hi> and <hi>Tin</hi> at home, which will laſt till we have a free Trade abroad, and
in the mean time will, by the help of this Office, paſs as currant and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
as <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall then alſo fall, not only to the Improving, but even to the invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and making New <hi>Manufactures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 9. <hi>That it will be a Shame and Diſcredit for Eminent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and others, to pawn their Goods, and none will Credit with Goods or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
ſuch Perſons as make uſe of this Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twill be a greater ſhame for a wiſe man not to improve his Eſtate ſo
far as he may.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Some men, though never ſo unwilling, will by their neceſſities
be compelled to it; as we have of late days ſeen many Perſons of Quality
brought to thoſe Shifts of pawning, which their Fore-fathers were never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41991:6"/>
2. Every man that brings in his Goods, doth not do it through want, but
out of a Principle, of Honour, Induſtry, and good Husbandry, being not
willing to have his Goods ly dead on his hands, eſpecially when a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Bargain offers it ſelf, nor can any man diſtinguiſh between him that
brings in his Goods to quicken his Trade, and him that brings them out of
neceſſity: beſides, this is not pawning of Goods, but an honourable way of
making Goods a Security for a Fund, by which a <hi>Bank</hi> may, for the great
Increaſe of Trade, be Eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>None will urge this <hi>Objection,</hi> but men of unfound Fortunes; for they
who have great Stocks of their own, and depend on no mans good Will;
do deſpiſe it.</p>
            <p>3. The City of <hi>London,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Aldermen, Common-Council Men,</hi> and
Eminent <hi>Merchants</hi> will Subſcribe and put in their Goods, who think it no
Reflection upon their Credit, but know it to be a certain benefit to their
Stock and Trade.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Myſtery and Benefit of Trade lyes in Exchange, and the
greateſt <hi>Merchants</hi> dayly Barter Commodities, and deal for <hi>Pins</hi> and
<hi>Pepper</hi> in Exchange for other Goods of like value; and this is only in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for Credit, and is part of the <hi>Merchants</hi> Stock running in Trade, and
more ſecure to him than in his Ware-houſes.</p>
            <p>4. That it being honeſt and profitable, when it is once common, it will be no
Diſ-repute, according to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Proverb, <hi>Lants wyſe, Lants eer,</hi> Country
Cuſtome is Country Honour, eſpecially, when it will not always be Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but for the moſt part, Induſtry, that will invite men to the uſe of it, as
in <hi>Lex Mercat,</hi> fol. 153. For 'tis a diſ-repute, only when a man is thought
to have reduced himſelf to that receſſity, through imprudent and vitious
Courſes: for Shame and Diſcredit, ought only to be the Reward of Vice:
ſo that if a Perſon were reduced to ſuch neceſſity by <hi>Fire, War, Thieves,
Loſs at Sea,</hi> or any ſuch like caſualty, it would become us rather to pity,
than ſcorn him. Now contrary, to ſuch as uſe this Office, in order to an
induſtrious Improvement of their Eſtates, is the greateſt Honour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
due: and conſequently Scorn and Contempt, to thoſe who
through Folly and Sloth reject it.</p>
            <p>5. If it be a Diſcredit or Damage to any, it muſt be only to thoſe that
Trade with other mens Stocks, who having little, may be unwilling to be
thought to have leſs. For they who Trade with their own, if they have
but honeſt Gain to warrant them, cannot be injured, neither in <hi>Reputation</hi>
nor <hi>Goods,</hi> and this Office invites only ſuch as may receive <hi>Accomodation,</hi>
not <hi>Inconvenience</hi> from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41991:6"/>
6. If it be a Diſcredit, I know none are exempted from it, or a greater,
but ſuch as can raiſe money on their word or ſingle Bond; for the reſt, if
they will have money, they muſt pawn either Land, Goods, or Friend: and
whether it be not ten times more honeſt and credible to pawn either of his
own, than his Friend, I leave the Ingenious Reader to judge; and yet we
know that many a good and rich <hi>Merchant</hi> doth pawn both Land and
Friends, and ſome (I am informed) do goods, which may as fitly be as
the other: Nor can I judge it a greater diſcredit to be Debitor to the Office
upon the Security of Goods, than to any Perſon whatſoever upon Perſonal
or real Security.</p>
            <p>7. It may be ſo ordered, if men pleaſe themſelves, that no man can know
whoſe Goods are brought into the Office, but the Party himſelf, and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
for he need but ſend his Goods by an Office-out-Porter, who is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in other as well as the Office-buſineſs, and is known by the City-Ticket,
and the Office Silver-Ticket which he carryes on his Breaſt; this
Porter ſees them Appraiſed and Regiſtred, and the Deliverer entred Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for ſo much; which Credit, when he diſpoſeth of it, the Party receiving
it cannot tell whether it was raiſed or received. And if the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
have a mind to come and ſee his Goods, 'tis no more than many men
do, to view and buy Goods; ſo that no Stranger can tell whether they be
his own, or that he would buy them; and the Office, if he gives them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
will ſell them for him, if Whole-ſale; and if Retail, then they can
be brought in and out without any notice but the Officers, for they need no
Chapmen.</p>
            <p>8. It is very poſſible, that a reſponſible Merchant may want ready money
to anſwer a Bill, which it will be more diſcredit to fail to diſcharge, than
to raiſe Credit, and it will be more prudent to raiſe it in the Office for
4 or 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> where they are tyed but by Weeks, than elſe where, at 7 or
10 <hi>per Cent</hi> without it.</p>
            <p>Objection 10. <hi>That the Office will not lend ſo much Credit as the Proprietor
needs, or would willingly have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. 'Tis granted, becauſe they'l have ſome Proportion left to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the <hi>Depoſitor,</hi> to come to redeem them.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Subſcribers</hi> or <hi>Depoſitors</hi> receive no damage by not having the
utmoſt value of their Goods in Credit, becauſe their Goods are ſtill at their
own diſpoſal, till the time contracted for their lying be expired, and if then
ſold at an Out-cry, it may be in their preſence, and (Credit being firſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
together with Intereſt and Charges paid) the Overplus is returned
to the Proprietor.</p>
            <p>3. Proprietors need not be very ſollicitous in this Caſe, for 'tis the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of the Undertakers to lend as much as ſafely they can; for they gain more
Intereſt and Part with leſs room in the Ware-houſe,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41991:7"/>
Objection 11. <hi>That Men will deſire to have Money rather than this Credit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes, and moſt times the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. They know the one, but have not yet been made to know or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the other, and therefore refuſe it, as they would do ſtrange money,
whoſe value they are ignorant of. And much of that Averſion they have
to Credit, proceeds alſo from this miſtake, <hi>Viz.</hi> That no Trade can be
managed without ſtamped Money, which is refuted both by the Antient
Univerſal way of Trading by Commutation, and the preſent, as well in the
<hi>Weſt-India,</hi> or <hi>American Plantations,</hi> where <hi>Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton</hi> and <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi>
paſs for money, as in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where the general Part of Trade is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by Credit in <hi>Bank.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Credit here recommended anſwers all the Ends and Intents of
money. For it will paſs as far as it is known, and our money doth no more:
the private Farthings lately in uſe amongſt us, were Current upon the ſame
account, becauſe men knew where to return them for money or Wares; ſo
men knowing where to return this Credit, it will for the ſame Reaſon be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>The like may be ſaid of the <hi>Sealed Bags</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> which paſs as
far as the <hi>Eaſt-India Prince</hi> hath Credit.</p>
            <p>3. This Credit will paſs as quick and nimble as money, and more; for it
will be granted that nine in ten, if not ninety nine in a hundred receive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to pay away again; 'tis but then repairing to the <hi>Bank,</hi> and taking an
<hi>Aſſignment,</hi> which will paſs from man to man, and ſo <hi>ad Infinitum</hi> from one
hand to another, and is preſent Payment.</p>
            <p>4. This Credit will pay Debts, buy or purchaſe, may be let out at Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
or hoarded up, and will furniſh the Poſſeſſour of it with all neceſſaries, as
well as money.</p>
            <p>5. It ſerves as a ſuperiour ſpecies of Money; for as <hi>Silver</hi> is for the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſmaller ſort of Commodities exchanged for <hi>Copper,</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> for
<hi>Silver,</hi> ſo this Credit, which is ſuperiour to <hi>Gold,</hi> or <hi>Silver,</hi> may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
for either, for Example. If I have 10 <hi>l.</hi> or more to pay, this Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
will do it, without turning it into <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver,</hi> but if I have under 10 <hi>l.</hi>
to pay, I may turn this Credit into <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver,</hi> as I may for ſmaller
Summs, <hi>Gold</hi> into <hi>Silver,</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> into <hi>Copper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Money is valuable, and affected meerly as 'tis a <hi>Medium</hi> of Commerce,
for of it ſelf it neither feeds, warms, cloaths, or defends, and this Credit is
as valuable in the ſame reſpect.</p>
            <p>7. This Credit is better than money, for it will paſs from man to man
without any damage either to it ſelf, or its Poſſeſſor, but money occaſions
great loſs of time, as well as trouble in telling, is ſubject to clipping, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting,
and robbery, and is oftentimes the occaſion of Bloodſhed and
Murder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41991:7"/>
8. If Credit be already much More uſed than money, as certainly it is, why
ſhould the Credit here offered be lyable to more exception than that which
is already in Uſe? eſpecially this being ſettled and fixed upon a ſurer
<hi>Fund</hi> and <hi>Baſis</hi> than the other, as hath been already ſhewed: What is all
Perſonal Security by Bonds, Bills, Books-Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Credit? Or real
Security by Lands, but a Credit given to thoſe Lands, that they bear a good
Title, and to the <hi>Mortgager,</hi> that he hath not otherwiſe preincumbred them?
And in the negotiating of Bills of Exchange, all that a man hath is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of the Drawer and Accepter: ſo that in effect all mens Perſonal
Eſtates (and real to) depend upon Paper and Parchment, and the Credit
that is given to it, except what they have by them in ready Caſh or Goods,
which is commonly inconſiderable in reſpect of the other.</p>
            <p>9. If any man that hath the Credit of this Office, hath occaſion for ready
money to be paid away under 10 <hi>l.</hi> he will be ſupplyed by any Neighbour,
Subſcriber, or Direction from the Office.</p>
            <p>10. And yet till the Office is univerſally known and received throughout
<hi>England,</hi> money may be ſometimes neceſſary, therefore 'tis propoſed, that
men ſhould at firſt bring in only part of their Stocks, which will be ſufficient
Demonſtration to them and the World, of the uſefulneſs of this Office. And
in the mean time, if any Perſon inhabiting in the Country, receives Credit,
which will not ſerve his purpoſe there till an Office be Eſtabliſhed there, yet
will there be Perſons of all Profeſſions willing to give him <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi>
in exchange for this Credit, for that the Credit is as paſſable the next mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
for Debts or Goods, as the moſt currant money.</p>
            <p>11. We will firſt define Credit, and ſee how far 'tis already practiſed
amongſt us, and what makes men accept it here, and from the Banks beyond
Sea.</p>
            <p>2. We will conſider what money is, and how it comes to be ſo deſirable,
and then comparing both, leave it to the Underſtanding Reader to Judge,
whether Credit or Money be moſt uſeful, alluring, or inviting.</p>
            <p>1. Credit is the Reputation of Mans Honeſty, or Ability, or of a things
intrinſick value, with both which Qualifications this Office is ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed.</p>
            <p>Credit in <hi>Amſterdam</hi>-Bank, is but to be regiſtred Creditor, and this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
currant, not only becauſe a man may have money for it when he will,
but becauſe of its known <hi>Reputation,</hi> for every man will receive it, and pay
Debts, or buy any where Commodities, none refuſing it, they being aſſured
it hath a valuable Pledge in a ſecure place, which Pledge cannot be removed
till the Creditor, who ever he be, ſhall be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41991:8"/>
But to further ſatisfie ſome men, how Trade can be driven, Commodities
bought, and Debts paid without money in <hi>Specie,</hi> beſides the Indubitable
certainty of it's being practiſed in the ſeveral Forreign <hi>Banks;</hi> I ſhall form
an Example or two, of the manner and conveniences of it, as ſuppoſe <hi>A.</hi>
oweth to <hi>B. 100 l. B.</hi> the like to <hi>C. C.</hi> the like to <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> the like to <hi>E.</hi>
and <hi>E.</hi> to <hi>F. F.</hi> to <hi>G. G.</hi> to <hi>H. H.</hi> to <hi>I.</hi> and <hi>I.</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> Which if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for them all to know, they might agree upon a Meeting, and quit each
other by Reſcounter. As for Example, <hi>A.</hi> quits <hi>I.</hi> he <hi>H.</hi> and <hi>H. G.</hi> and ſo
on, till <hi>B.</hi> quits <hi>A.</hi> and then all are ſatisfied without one Farthing being paid
in <hi>Specie;</hi> when elſe (for want of this poſſibility of meeting (becauſe each
knows but his immediate Creditor and Debtor, and not the mediate) or
ready money, or for default of it, this Office) they are all puzzled with
Debts and Credits. For if <hi>A.</hi> had the money, or raiſed Credit in the Office
upon his Goods, <hi>A.</hi> would pay <hi>B.</hi> and ſo on, till <hi>I.</hi> paid <hi>A.</hi> by which it
appears, if any of theſe were diſhoneſt, or diſable, what a trouble they bring
upon all the reſt, and for ſo much, what a ſtop upon Trade. For though
one man perchance, is able to turn 100 <hi>l.</hi> but ten times a Year, yet the ſame
100 <hi>l.</hi> may be by many men, turned a thouſand times a Year; all which, as
the caſe now ſtands, may be hindred by one covetous or diſhoneſt Perſon.
Now, by this Office, if a man be able, his Creditors will in a manner obliege
him to be honeſt, for what is paſt; and for the future there will be no need
of truſting, which only crept into the World, becauſe there was not money
enough, or that it made not ſo ſwift a Circuit as was deſired, to meaſure
Commodities, and not becauſe the Perſon credited was poor; for very few
will truſt a poor honeſt man with much.</p>
            <p>If then it be according to a Mans Eſtate, why ſhould any run the hazard
of truſting, when they need not, becauſe ſuch as they would Credit, may
raiſe a Credit in the Office, and moſt wiſe men ſeek to deal ſecurely, and
the Credited can ſuſtain no damage, becauſe his Goods in the Office are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the furrher from a <hi>Market,</hi> and he can, with one <hi>Moity</hi> of his Goods,
raiſe as much Credit as he can expect to be credited with elſewhere. Note
alſo, that when a man brings Goods out of his Shop to raiſe Credit, ſo he
brings the other Goods which he bought with that Credit, to furniſh his
Shop again: and though his Shop may be a little the leſs furniſhed, his Purſe
will be the better by the Gain: for his Trade will be ſo quickned, that he
can make many more returns; which, with a ſmall Stock, is equivalent to a
greater, with fewer returns. Another Example proves this Practice more
clearly, without damage to any that receives this Credit, for what Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
ſoever, as, imagine <hi>A.</hi> receives this Credit by Aſſignation from another,
or raiſeth it upon his own Goods brought into the Office, and transferring
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41991:8"/>
it on <hi>C.</hi> diſchargeth a Debt, which he hath in Exchange of his Credit, and
ſo is not injured. <hi>C.</hi> by transferring it on <hi>D.</hi> receives from him the like
value in ſuch Goods he hath need of, and ſo ſuſtains no damage by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of the Credit, becauſe he hath in Exchange as much Goods for it. <hi>D.</hi>
transferrs it to <hi>E.</hi> for a parcel of Land of the like value, which he
Purchaſeth of <hi>E.</hi> and ſo not damnified. <hi>E.</hi> transferrs it on <hi>F.</hi> as a Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with a Daughter that <hi>F.</hi> marryes, <hi>E.</hi> not injured, becauſe by it he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged
from the Payment of a Portion, and rids himſelf of the Charge of a
Daughter. <hi>F.</hi> transferrs it upon <hi>G.</hi> for the conſideration of Repayment, and
in the mean time, Security with Intereſt of 5. or 6. <hi>per Cent.</hi> more or leſs,
as they can agree. <hi>F.</hi> hath no damage, becauſe he hath Security and Intereſt.
<hi>G.</hi> eſteems it as good as money, becauſe by transferring it, he anſwers his
preſent occaſions, of either paying an unavoidable Debt, or purchaſing his
intended or neceſſary Commodities; which, as before demonſtrated, none
will refuſe, becauſe of its conveniency of anſwering all the Intents of money.
And Credit might proceed to the end of the World, and no man
one Farthing wronged, nor money in <hi>Sprcie</hi> ever paid. Our dayly
Practiſe of receiving Bonds, Bills, Letters of Credit, and Exchange, which
are no more than Credit, will witneſs as much. Men are likewiſe credited
according to what they have in Poſſeſſion, of their own, or by Credit; for
we are apt to truff a Perſon credited by others, which I inſtance, to ſhew,
that this Office (being credited by many, and ſtored with more Goods, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of being ſcrupled for having ſo many to anſwer) increaſeth rather
its <hi>Reputation:</hi> for the more it hath, the more it can anſwer, and it will be
the care of the Office, being managed by wiſe and underſtanding Perſons, to
have no more Credit abroad than Goods at home to ballance the ſame, it
being a vanity not to be ſuppoſed in ſuch a Society, to call the Credit of the
whole Office in Queſtion, by ſending out Credit, which hath no Foundation
within to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>There are likewiſe theſe further Encouragements to men to receive this
Credit.</p>
            <p>1. They that raiſe it, will be ſo pleaſed at their own conveniency, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſupplyed at a low rate, and ſatisfied, That it will as well redeem their
Goods as Money, that they will willingly receive it in Payment from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>2. Men by this meanes will be inabled to pay their Debts; and clear
Accompts, which otherwiſe might lye a long time dorment, and it may be
deſperate, to the great decreaſe of Trade.</p>
            <p>3. This Credit, though a Paper Record, and of no intrinſick value, yet,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41991:9"/>
as a Key to a rich Treaſury, keeps ſafe Goods of intrinſick vallue, which
without the Key cannot be ſtirred, or like a good Mortgage, which ſecures
the Land as well as if the Land were in a mans Pocket, can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortgaged
and aſſigned over, as well as if it were ſo much money in <hi>Specie,</hi> after En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the Title. And the Office deſires none to uſe it upon any <hi>Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
Faith,</hi> but upon full ſatisfaction, and will be ready to give ſuch further
reaſonable ſatisfaction as may be deſired.</p>
            <p>4. 'Tis but a Token, like <hi>Farthings,</hi> only of a greater value, which <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things</hi>
paſs currant, as far as the Owner is known, and is not carryed back
ſo ſoon as received, but once a year; or ſeldomer, or oftner, upon occaſion,
is brought to the Owner, and changed into <hi>Silver,</hi> which this Office will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
how to do. And ſo I come to ſhew what Money is, and its uſes, and
wherein Credit correſponds to it. In this I ſhall be brief; It is a Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
appointed by the Authority of the Place, for the common and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Standard to meaſure other Commodities with; in ſome Countries, <hi>Bones,
Beanes, Beads, Shells,</hi> &amp;c. which though of no intrinſick value, are made
publick Tickets to purchaſe any other valuable Commodity. Money is an
Accomptant or meanes by which a Man keeps an accompt of his Eſtate, and
in theſe and moſt civilized Parts, is either <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> ſtamped, which
pieces are not of the real intrinſick value they paſs for, but are made currant
by the ſtamp of the Authority of the reſpective Countries, and was invented
for the ſake of the following <hi>Qualifications,</hi> many of which might be found
in other Wares.</p>
            <p>1. Money is known by all, and therefore uſed by all; that's the reaſon a
man is ſaid to be worth 1000 <hi>l.</hi> more or leſs, when it may be he hath not
10 <hi>l.</hi> money, for if they ſhould ſay, he is worth 400 Head of Cattel, ſix or
700 Load of Hay; 150 or 200 Pieces of Cloth, none would know what
Judgment to make of it: though a man is really as rich, that hath thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Goods, as he that hath money. A man alſo need but value his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
that money which he hath in Exchange is valued by the publick, and
muſt be credited: for <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> admits of ſeveral <hi>Allayes,</hi> only we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but one of them is the Standard for money, and ſo Cloth and other
Goods, if they were made by a certain Standard (which is poſſible) they
might likewiſe be currant.</p>
            <p>2. The value of money for the moſt part continues and is fixed: though
there be never ſo great or ſmall quantity of it in the Country, but other
things are accordingly varyed; for, for the moſt part, when 'tis plenty, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
are dear, and when ſcarce, cheap, and this is poſſible to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on any other Commodities.</p>
            <p>3. Money is durable, ſo that a man is not neceſſitated to Trade; for if
he ſaid it twenty years by him, he finds the ſame without diminution
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41991:9"/>
which if it were in Comodities, he muſt Trade, or ſpend all, for Bread will
ſcarce laſt a week, <hi>Cheeſe</hi> a year, <hi>Cloth</hi> ſome few years more. So that at the
20. yeares end, inſtead of being worth 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Man is worth nothing but
rotten Dung, or Moth-eaten decayed <hi>Cloth,</hi> for none of which he can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
another <hi>Commodity.</hi> But <hi>Mettalls</hi> and Precious Stones, might anſwer
this and other Qualifications. And if you object a poſſibility of having Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
counterfeited; I anſwer, That all the care hitherto taken, hath not
been able to prevent the counterfeiting of Money, and if it may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
with in one <hi>Coin,</hi> it may be in another.</p>
            <p>4. The generality of Commodities are not of ſo rich intrinſick value, but
that Men muſt, as in <hi>Sweden,</hi> go to Market with a <hi>wheel barrow</hi> or <hi>Cart,</hi> when
as a great value of Money, can be put in ones Pocket, or under ones Arm.</p>
            <p>Now Credit anſwers the firſt, by having its value, as certainly known,
for a man needs but name any ſumme, to the value of what he is really Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
in the Office, and 'tis of intrinſick value, &amp; known by his onely naming
it, as if <hi>A.</hi> being Creditor, deſires the Office to enter <hi>B.</hi> Creditor for 10 <hi>l.</hi>
then <hi>B.</hi> is aſſured of currant indiſputable ten pound. It anſwers the ſecond,
by being more certain, for moneys ſometimes riſeth and falleth, but Credit
is alwayes certain to the perſons receiving and poſſeſſing it, though uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the Goods, for the ſame may ſometimes be valued at the delivery
5. <hi>per-cent.</hi> more, than at another time, according to a Market price. Credit
once made, is certain, but in the making is uncertain.</p>
            <p>It anſwers the 3d. in that it is as durable, for it may laſt to the end of
the World, without ever ſuffering any Decay: the Fund of which <hi>Credit</hi>
only being often changed, according to the durableneſs of its nature.</p>
            <p>It anſwers the <hi>4th.</hi> And exceeds it; for 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Credit, may lye in the
Room of 10 <hi>l.</hi> Gold. It farther excells Money, in theſe particulars: it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be counterfeited or Clipt, it is ſoon told, it cannot be ſtolen, it is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and tranſmitted from Place to Place, either within Land or beyond Sea
by Bills of Exhange, with eaſe and ſafety, and many more. Beſides, Money
rightly conſidered, is not ſo deſireable, for a man can paſs away Money, but
not conſume it, as he doth other Commodities for Back and Belly: And a
man only endeavours to get Money, that he may purchaſe Commodities,
both to Gain and Conſume. So when we ſell Commodities for Money, 'tis
with a Deſign, only to by other Commodities.</p>
            <p>For all Men deſire Wealth, Riches or Money, only that they may feed
Dainty, be Cloathed Richly, be well Attended and Obeyed <hi>&amp;c</hi> and entail
the like abundance upon their Poſterity. A Trades-man is better pleaſed, to
have his Shop and Ware-houſe ſtored with Goods, than his Bags repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with Money, and a man is as wealthy that hath 100 <hi>l.</hi> in Hay. Graſs,
or Dung, as he that hath it in Gold. For as 100 <hi>l.</hi> Gold can fetch any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
100 <hi>l.</hi> of Hay, or other commodity will fetch ſo much Gold: for
bertering is ſtill continued, but at every commutation, Money, as a well
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41991:10"/>
known witneſs, muſt be the Medium for want of this better way of Credit.
Money is a Bondage upon Trade, becauſe no Commodity is Currant till it
hath been meaſured by it, which according to the quantity of either, is
ſooner or later done, and accordingly is Trade quick or ſlow. And it is worthy
conſideration how far it may conſiſt with the rules of Policy, and the intereſt
of State, to enſlave all our Staple Wares to the commodity of forrain Princes,
who upon ocaſion can withhold it from us, and ſo retarde and deſtroy our
Trade at pleaſure, unleſſe we can contrive ſomething to officiate in its room
which if poſſible, is beſt beforehand. <hi>Ireland</hi> can witneſs, that they cannot
thrive notwithſtanding their abundance, becauſe this forrain commodity
Money is with-held from them. Many a man hath pe<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſhed through Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and Cold that had Money, but none that while wel<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fed and Cloathed,
hath periſhed for want of Money.</p>
            <p>Objection 12. <hi>That the Citizens, eſpecially</hi> Bankers, Scriveners, <hi>and</hi>
Broakers, <hi>will unanimouſly oppoſe this Office, being afraid it may undo them,
and many</hi> Retailers.</p>
            <p>Which will confirm all the reſt of the Inhabitants in the good Opinion
of the Office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. Private Intereſt ought to ſtoop to publick Good, and if no
new deſign ſhould have been put in practice, leſt ſome particular Perſons
might be injured, then Printing, Guns, cutting of Navigable Rivers, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Water-works muſt have never apppeared in the World, to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of Clerks, Fletchers, Carryers, and Tankard-bearers, for what one gets
ſome other always looſeth.</p>
            <p>2. Where were the Injury, if all thoſe Profeſſions or Trades were reduced
within their juſt and due Limits, for a Scriveners Profeſſion is only Writing,
a Goldſmith, making and ſelling of Plate, and a Broakers, buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of old Cloaths, and as for the Bankers, 'tis better that all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the City be accomodated than a few Bankers gratified, by ſome of
whom a great many Families have ſmarted, and who are an Upſtart Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and no ſmall grievance to the Nation; and yet this Office doth not
obliege any one from uſing the Bankers; but the Subſcribers only for ſo
much as they Subſcribe; but the great Deſign of it, is to invite all <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi>
and great Dealers (who poſſibly are not the <hi>Broakers</hi> and <hi>Scriveners</hi>
beſt Cuſtomers) to increaſe their Trade by this <hi>Currant Credit,</hi> and to put
Tradeſmen in a may of Ballancing their Accounts one with another, to
which they have no eaſie ſtep without this <hi>Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. They that do now uſe thoſe Profeſſions, may ſometimes find comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Employments in the Service of this Deſign, and by employing their
Stocks, otherwiſe Improve their Trade, and be conſiderable Gainers that
way.</p>
            <p>4. Thoſe Profeſſions riſe and fall by the value of Money, as we ſee at this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41991:10"/>
time now (Money is at 4, or 5 <hi>per Cent.)</hi> they do not turn to Accompt</p>
            <p>Object. 13. <hi>That it will prejudice the Rich and Antient Merchants, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them uncapable of keeping up their Market, and the Younger, becauſe their</hi>
Goods are Mortgaged.</p>
            <p>'Twill lower the Market: but to the profit both of Rich and Poor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Should it be ſo, yet is it juſt and neceſſary that ſuch <hi>Merchants</hi>
may be reſtrained from illegal Ingroſing and Impoſing of high Prices upon
their Commodities: but the contrary will rather appear; for by the help
of this <hi>Office</hi> the young Merchants will be the better inabled to anſwer their
<hi>Bills,</hi> and kept from being neceſſitated to abate their Price, and under-ſell
the Market.</p>
            <p>2. If they gain leſs by one bargain, they gain more by having ten Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains
for one, which they may have by the quick Returns they will make
by this <hi>Office,</hi> for Example, If a <hi>Merchant</hi> deals for 5000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and
raiſes 20 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> his Gain is 1000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> but this Office will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the ſame <hi>Merchant</hi> by his quick Returns to deal for 50000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi>
by which if he raiſes but 5 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> profit, he will get 2500 <hi>l. per annum,</hi>
which is a great and conſiderable Improvement of his Gain, and yet his
Trade managed with as little trouble as before.</p>
            <p>3. That can only be advantagious to few great monied men, but 'tis prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to thouſands, for it muſt be agreed by all, that ingroſſing like <hi>Stagnation</hi>
in the Blood, is a great damage to the whole Body; and the Advancement
of Trade, muſt be by many Hands and Purſes, and a quick Circulation, and
Rotation gives it Vigour and Life.</p>
            <p>4. When 'tis known, that convenience as well as neceſſity induceth men to
bring thither their Goods: they will not offer leſs than if it were in their
own Warehouſes.</p>
            <p>5. Such as may bring them thither for neceſſity, will be no looſer, for if
they cannot have a good price, their Wants being ſupplyed by the <hi>Office,</hi>
they can wait till they may, and if none can be procured, they may if they
pleaſe, have them offered at the Out-cry, where perchance they may yield
more than elſe where.</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>Office</hi> may chance to help them to Cuſtomers, knowing the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
rate they can be afforded at.</p>
            <p>Objection 14. <hi>That it will diſcover Mens Eſtates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Impoſſible, nor their Dealings neither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It diſcovers no more than Forreign <hi>Banks</hi> do, which Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
if there diſpenced with, becauſe they are of ſuch neceſſary uſe; but
yet 'tis impoſſible it ſhould diſcover a man's whole Eſtate, unleſs he trade
with no more than his own Stock, and his whole Stock be at one time in the
<hi>Office,</hi> and known to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Objection 15. <hi>A Mans Eſtate, or Goods will, by putting them into the</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<hi>be expoſed to the Seizure of his Creditors, or Adverſaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41991:11"/>
'Twill rather prevent any ſuch occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. 'Tis not intended that any man ſhall have ſight of another
mans <hi>Folio,</hi> or an account given him of any Mans <hi>Credit</hi> in the <hi>Office,</hi> unleſs
the Party himſelf give direct on for it.</p>
            <p>2. The goods which any man brings into the <hi>Office,</hi> are no longer his, but the
<hi>Offices,</hi> when he hath once transferred the <hi>Credit</hi> to another, the Goods being
Security to that other for ſo much value as he gave to the firſt Owner for his
<hi>Credit,</hi> and if a <hi>Creditor,</hi> &amp;c. will have them, he muſt take them <hi>cum Onere,</hi>
and pay the money they are ingaged for, which in moſt caſes will ſcarſe
countervail his trouble.</p>
            <p>3. They are as ſafe in the <hi>Office</hi> as in the Owners Shop, and far more,
for ſhould he borrow money upon Security of his goods remaining ſtill in his
ſhop and poſſeſſion, the ſecurity given would be lyable to queſtion: Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being the greateſt ſign of Fraud that can be, but being once ingaged in the
<hi>Office,</hi> and ſo much money or Credit advanced upon them, there can be no
ſuch doubt, becauſe they are out of his Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>4. They are ſecurer in the <hi>Office</hi> than in his own Poſſeſſion, becauſe the
Property is leſs diſtinguiſhable.</p>
            <p>Objection 16. <hi>That this Office will not equally accomodate all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. Granted, nor nothing elſe under the <hi>Sun,</hi> and yet many
things notwithſtanding highly valued, and beneficial to Mankind, as a <hi>Stage-Coach</hi>
to <hi>Briſtol</hi> cannot accomodate a Perſon for <hi>York,</hi> and yet as uſeful as
<hi>York Stage-Coach,</hi> or any other.</p>
            <p>2. They that have no Goods, or none ſuch as the <hi>Office</hi> is willing to accept,
nor any Eſtate wherewith to purchaſe this <hi>Currant Credit,</hi> cannot receive
an immediate Benefit by it, yet may be ſome way advantaged; For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
If one man brings <hi>500000l.</hi> to <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Gold,</hi> though the money be
originally his, yet this Importation by the Expence of that Perſon, proves
advantagious, being diſperſed, to many thouſands, by increaſing and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Trade; and ſo will this <hi>Credit</hi> in the hands of a few, be profitable to
all for the ſame reaſon.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Pro rato,</hi> it muſt be.</p>
            <p>Objection 17. <hi>That it will hinder the Sale of Goods, becauſe moſt Chapmen
buy for time, and the Goods being ingaged, the</hi> Merchant <hi>cannot deliver them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Much the contrary: becauſe it increaſeth Conſumption.</p>
            <p>2. In the practice of this <hi>Office,</hi> it will be found that this <hi>Objection</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
little; for when all men may have a full Trade upon ſecure <hi>Credit,</hi> as
good as money, no wiſe man will hazard his Goods at time upon a private
<hi>Credit,</hi> unleſs for very good Reaſons. But if ſtill there ſhould be ſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitous
Perſons, who have taken as much <hi>Credit</hi> upon their Goods in the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
as they will bear, and ſelling them, are not able to redeem and deliver
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41991:11"/>
them; it is almoſt impoſſible for the moſt comprehenſive Deſign in the
World to provide againſt all ſuch Circumſtances as mens Neceſſities may
bring them into; yet even are there many helps in this caſe, as will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear in Practice.</p>
            <p>3. Perſons that are not neceſſitous, may ſend in other Goods in liew of
the firſt.</p>
            <p>4. This Inconvenience cannot affect any man that hath not transferred
his <hi>Credit</hi> in the <hi>Office:</hi> for Inſtance, If I bring in <hi>1000 l.</hi> worth of Goods, and
have <hi>Credit</hi> upon them for <hi>700 l.</hi> and then ſell <hi>300 l.</hi> worth of the Goods, I
may take out of the <hi>Office</hi> what I have ſold, and for the Remainder I ſhall have
ſtill Credit left proportionable to the vallue of thoſe that remain behind.</p>
            <p>Objection 18. <hi>That</hi> Credit <hi>cannot anſwer ſmall and Country Occaſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. As well as <hi>Guineys</hi> doth <hi>Half-penny</hi> Bargains, by Exchange.</p>
            <p>2. There is no need of this <hi>Objection,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Bank</hi> only receives
and gives <hi>Credit</hi> for Summs of ten pounds and upwards.</p>
            <p>3. The firſt part I grant. But if that were an Exception ſufficient to diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, then muſt <hi>Gold</hi> be rejected, becauſe there are not pence and half pence
of <hi>Gold. Credit</hi> is another Species of Money, wherewith Great Sums can be
paid with more eaſe, than with either <hi>Silver</hi> or <hi>Gold,</hi> and the only uſe of
<hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> will be for Summs under <hi>10l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the laſt I anſwer, That any <hi>Subſcriber</hi> that hath <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> will
exchange it for <hi>Credit</hi> to an Acquaintance, as he will <hi>Silver</hi> for a <hi>Guiney;</hi> but
if for ſome ſmall time they cannot be ſo well accomodated; yet as ſoon as
we ſhall have ſettled it in every County, we can make any man <hi>Creditor</hi> in
the <hi>Office</hi> of his County for what he receives at <hi>London,</hi> which <hi>Credit</hi>
can be tranſmitted from Place to Place throughout <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 19. <hi>That the Intereſt of 6. per Cent is too much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. 'Tis neither ſo for the <hi>Depoſitor</hi> nor the <hi>Officer,</hi> for few or
none will lend ſo cheap upon Goods.</p>
            <p>2. If they will now, when Trade increaſeth, as it infallibly will, none
will then, or but to very few Friends, upon very few ſort of Commodities</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Depoſiter</hi> hath into the Bargain ſafe and orderly keeping of his
Goods, Ware-houſe-Room, and the uſe of it to buy and ſell as in his own;
and Book-keeping for ſo much, beſides a good Evidence or Record to his
Payments. So that the Neat <hi>Intereſt</hi> cannot be 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Office</hi> cannot take leſs, for the Charge of <hi>Rent</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> comes
at leaſt to 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of the 6.</p>
            <p>Obj. 20. <hi>That Goods will ſpoil in the Office through neglest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:41991:12"/>
We anſwer that every one hath Liberty, as in a pound Onvert, to take
care of his own Goods.</p>
            <p>2. It will concern the <hi>Office</hi> to keep Servants on purpoſe, to uſe all means
of preſerving the Goods from <hi>Mould, Mildew, Canker, Ruſt, Rats, Mice,
Moths, Spots, Stains, Wet, Dust, Rot,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe they are not aſſured the
Deliverer will redeem them: if therefore any Damage ſhould happen to the
Goods, they will hardly reimburſe the <hi>Office</hi> their Credit and Charges.</p>
            <p>3. Notwithſtanding this <hi>Objection,</hi> we ſee <hi>Lumbards</hi> beyond ſea are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented,
and we ſhall have the ſame, or greater care.</p>
            <p>Objection 21. <hi>The Goods will be damnified in the Removing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We anſwer, that Goods which are to be fixed we deſire not, and for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veables,
they uſually are often removed, and cannot be much damnified by
once or twice removing. Beſides, if <hi>Merchants pleaſe,</hi> they may have their
conſtant Ware-houſe Room at the <hi>Office,</hi> paying no more than elſewhere,
and then they may ſend their Goods from the <hi>Cuſtome-Houſe</hi> immediately
thither.</p>
            <p>Objection 22. <hi>The Foundation of Credit bad, becauſe upon periſhable
Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſay, that though the Goods are periſhable, yet the <hi>Credit</hi> is Good,
becauſe they are always diſpoſed of, either by Redemption or Sale, before
they can periſh, and if the <hi>Credit</hi> be not redeemed, there is Money, or other
ſubſtantial Goods ſtill to anſwer it.</p>
            <p>Objection 23. <hi>That this Credit will not yield 3</hi> d. per diem, per Cent. <hi>at
the Goldſmiths; as Money, nor any thing in the Office whilſt it lyes there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I deny, for firſt, when a <hi>Merchant</hi> takes up money at the <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths,</hi>
'Tis for immediate Uſe, either to buy, or pay away. Then the <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith</hi>
being <hi>Creditor</hi> for all that lyes in his hands, aſſigns over ſo much as he
deſires, and the <hi>Merchant</hi> again to the Party ſelling him Goods, or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him Bills of Exchange, which Bills, though now uſually ſatisfied in <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
will be anſwered with <hi>Credit,</hi> or at leaſt, moſt of them that are conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For ſuppoſe <hi>A. B.</hi> of <hi>London</hi> conſigns <hi>1000 l.</hi> worth of <hi>Cloths</hi> to a
<hi>Factor</hi> in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and orders him to lay out <hi>500 l.</hi> in certain Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
and remit the reſt; the <hi>Fastor</hi> draws upon <hi>C. D.</hi> of <hi>London</hi> a Bill
of Exchange to be paid to <hi>A. B.</hi> for <hi>500 l.</hi> which the ſaid <hi>Fastor</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed
to buy Commodities, according to the order of <hi>A. B.</hi> his Principal.
<hi>A. B.</hi> preſents this Bill to <hi>C. D.</hi> and he accepts it, and accordingly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<hi>A. B.</hi> to be Regiſtred <hi>Creditor</hi> for ſo much in the <hi>Office,</hi> which <hi>A. B.</hi>
is contented with, becauſe he may not export it in <hi>Specie,</hi> nor will he ſuffer
it to lye dead. And all other Uſes and Intents of money, <hi>Credit</hi> anſwers, as
above declared.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Office</hi> (if a <hi>Creditor</hi> will aſſign it over to the <hi>Office)</hi> for the time
being, it is <hi>Creditor,</hi> will allow as <hi>Goldſmiths,</hi> but if the <hi>Creditor</hi> remaines
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41991:12"/>
               <hi>Creditor,</hi> there is no more reaſon for them to expect Allowance, than when
money lyes in their own Houſes: For, whil'ſt they remain <hi>Creditors,</hi> it is in
their Poſſeſſion,</p>
            <p>Objection. 24. <hi>That it will occaſion many a Mans Ruine, becauſe Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
ſeeing a way for their Payment, will be more earneſt for their Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I deny. For <hi>Firſt, Creditors</hi> will not be earneſt, unleſs, often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded.</p>
            <p>2. You may as well ſay, a man ought not to have his own, for fear of
ruining another.</p>
            <p>3. All good Husbands that owe money, have money owing them, and
if they are preſſed to pay, they can likewiſe preſs Payment; and this ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
one as well as another to pay. For it will be a meanes to balance all
Debts and Credit.</p>
            <p>4. Thoſe that are not good Husbands, ruine themſelves, and therefore the
<hi>Creditor</hi> hath reaſon, if he can, to ſecure his own.</p>
            <p>Objection 25. <hi>That it will cauſe too great abundance of Commodities, that
there will be no Vent for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will grant the firſt part, and deny the latter; For we find that one man
can conſume <hi>1000 l.</hi> worth of Commodities in a year, and another but <hi>10 l.</hi>
and by this means, if all, or moſt men become ten times richer, they will
conſequently conſume ten times more. Beſides there are many of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
may be carryed abroad, where they cannot want a Market. For
we muſt never expect to out-trade the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 26. That ſome Commodities are ſo old faſhioned, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſold.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that no Commodities are ſo old faſhioned, but that they may be
new enough in another place, as mix'd Red and Yellow <hi>Damask</hi> is worn in
Waſtcoats by Women in <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> nor ſo much decayd, but that they
be of ſome uſe, as the beſt Rags for Paper, the worſt for Improving Land.
God having ſo ordered all things by his immenſe Wiſdom and Univerſal
Providence, that nothing ſhould be in vain, and that the Corruption of one
thing ſhould be the generation of another.</p>
            <p>The Uſefulneſs of <hi>Banks</hi> in Trade is known and approved by all verſed
in Commerce.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Office of Credit,</hi> now on Foot, under the Inſpection of the City, is the
ſame with <hi>Forreign Banks</hi> enlarged only by altering the <hi>Fund,</hi> from Money
to all ſorts of Wares and Merchandize: But in all other Proceedings
alike.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſuch as have no leiſure to be Convinced by Diſcourſe, may
at firſt try by bringing in a ſmall Stock of Goods or Lands of a Hundred
pounds, or more, which will convince them of the Security, Conveniency
and Currency of the <hi>Credit,</hi> and after, upon ſolid Experience, they may
make uſe of the ſaid <hi>Office</hi> with greater Stocks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:41991:13"/>
Eſpecially ſince this being a <hi>Bank of Honour,</hi> there can be no Shame when
all or moſt Perſons frequent it, in order to a more prudent Improvement of
their Eſtates, and not only to ſupply their Neceſſities, which alſo is alone
Shameful, when by <hi>Luxury, Sloth</hi> or <hi>Imprudence</hi> they are reduced to it, and
not ſo, through <hi>Misfortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is there any Hazard, for all Officers gives the City great <hi>Security</hi>
for their <hi>Faithful Behaviour;</hi> nothing paſſeth in the <hi>Office</hi> without the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi>
or <hi>Controule</hi> of an <hi>Alderman</hi> or <hi>Common-Council-man,</hi> appointed
by the City; Every man hath daily Acceſs to his own Goods, if he pleaſe,
and laſtly, the Perſons to whom the Profit belongs, have not the <hi>Truſt,</hi> and
the Perſons <hi>Entruſted,</hi> have not the <hi>Profit</hi> but a <hi>Salary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Office</hi> anſwers the Wiſe mans Advantage, the Generous mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,
and Publick Spirit, and the Needy mans indiſpenſable occaſions;
the <hi>Credit</hi> being better than that of any <hi>Forreign Banks,</hi> becauſe of a more
valuable <hi>Depoſit,</hi> and as uſeful as Money, purchaſing any thing as well at the
currant Market Price, at leaſt from any of the <hi>Ten thouſand Subſcribers,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom (for their common Benefit of having ſo great a Stock of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Credit more Confined among themſelves, beſides their <hi>Fund</hi> of Money
and Credit nothing hereby diminiſhed) we deſire for our Eaſe and their
Benefit, if poſſible it may from time to time be Aſſigned, though the <hi>Office</hi>
undertakes to make the <hi>Credit</hi> allwayes Currant, if not by the Common, by
all Extraordinary meanes; ſo that none need fear any Dammage or Delay,
by receiving the Aſſignment of it.</p>
            <p>'Tis alledged above, there is no Shame in ſending a <hi>Fund</hi> of Goods into
this <hi>Office,</hi> which clearly appears by its Univerſality, and its helping Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
as well as accomodating Neceſſities, for Prudence, honeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
and Frugality, merit Honour, when only Luxury, Sloth, and Folly
are rewarded with Shame.</p>
            <p>The Great, Good, and Rich Men for the publick Good, which always
carryes its Reward with it, are invited, not ſo much to ſerve their preſent
occaſions, as to countenance and skreen the Neceſſitous from pretended
Shame, and none are under this Obligation for above a Year: as alſo to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the number of Receivers of <hi>Credit:</hi> and contribute to the vaſt
Charge of ſo great and good an Undertaking, without loſs or hazard to
themſelves, and for which their Names ſhall be tranſmitted by Records in
Braſs, to Poſterity for the firſt <hi>Subſcribers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis not to be ſuppoſed that this <hi>Office</hi> is not uſeful, becauſe it pretends
not to anſwer all Occaſions, no more than <hi>Briſtol Stage-Coach</hi> ought to
be ſuppreſſed, becauſe it doth not accomodate a Traveller to <hi>York;</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
under the <hi>Sun</hi> anſwering all Emergencies: therefore all are invited
to try the firſt Year, and ſuch as find their Account in it, may continue,
the reſt may forbear, till they do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41991:13"/>
Where there is no Shame, nor more Hazard in the Tryal than in all
common and ordinary Trade and Dealings, the bare propoſing publick and
private Advantages, may be ſufficient to invite prudent and generous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to make an Experiment of our Office.</p>
            <p>But where there is either Shame or Hazard, there clear proofs of the ſaid
Advantages are but ſufficient.</p>
            <p>That when any <hi>Subſcriber</hi> is proved to ſell dearer for the <hi>Office-Credit,</hi>
than he would if he had received ready money, which in no reſpect is ſo
good, his Name ſhall be raced out of the Liſt of the <hi>Subſcribers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Objections, Anſwers,</hi> and <hi>Inſtructions</hi> are not to be expoſed to publick
view but reſerved for the uſe of our <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> and to that purpoſe
they are adviſed to peruſe them frequently, to make them ready in the
uſe of them; and if a new <hi>Objection</hi> be ſtarted, they may promiſe an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi>
the next Meeting, and in the mean time tranſmit the ſame to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers
