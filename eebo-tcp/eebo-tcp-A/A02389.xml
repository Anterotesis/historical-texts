         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

there is nothing more neceſſary in a common weale, then that

I purpoſe not to ſtand herevpon the particulars, becauſe they
be in parte ſetforth in the tragedies folowing. Yet by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waye
this I note (wiſhing all other to doe the like) namely, that as
good gouernours haue neuer lacked their deſerued praiſes: ſo
haue not the bad eſcaped infamy, beſides ſuch plagues as are
horrible to heare of. For God (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordeiner of offices) although
he ſuffer them for puniſhment of the people to be often occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
of ſuch, as are rather ſpoilers and Iudaſſes, than toilers
or Iuſtices (whom the ſcriptures cal Hypocrits) yet ſuffereth
he them not to ſcape vnpuniſhed, becauſe they diſhonour him.
For it is Gods own office, yea his chief office which they beare
and abuſe. For as Iuſtice is the chief vertue, ſo is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, the chiefeſt office: and therfore hath God eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
it with the chiefeſt name, honouring and calling Kinges
and all officers vnder them by his owne name: Gods. Ye be al
Gods, as many as haue in your charge any miniſtration of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
What a foule ſhame were it for any nowe to take vpon
them the name and office of God, and in their doings to ſhew
<pb facs="tcp:660:3"/>
themſelues deuils? God cannot of Iuſtice, but plague ſuche
ſhameleſſe preſumption and hipocriſie, and that with ſhamful
death, diſeaſes, or infamye. Howe he hath plagued euil rulers

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN the Printer had purpoſed</hi>
with himſelf to Print Lidgates
tranſlation of Bochas, of the fal
of Princes, hauinge made priuy
thereto, many both honourable
and Worſhippefull: hee was
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayled by dyuers of them to
procure a continuance of the Storye from where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Bochas left, vnto this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time, chiefly of ſuch
as Fortune had abuſed here in this Iſland: which
might bee as a Myrrour for men of all eſtates and
degrees aſwell Nobles as other, to behold the ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
deceiptes of the wauering Lady, &amp; the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of all kinde of vices. Which aduice liked him
ſo well, that he required mee to take paynes therein:
but becauſe it was a matter paſſing my wit &amp; ſkill,
and more thanckleſſe than gaynefull to enterpriſe. I
refuſed vtterly alone to vndertake it without the
helpe of ſutch, as in wit were apt, in learninge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and in iudgemente and eſtimation able to
wield and diſcharge the weight of ſutch a burden,
thinkinge ſo to ſhift my handes. But hee earneſt
and diligent in hys affayres, procure me an Athlas
<pb facs="tcp:660:6"/>
to laye the burden vppon my ſhoulders, which I
would not haue undertaken, but that ſhortly after
diuers learned men (whoſe many giftes nede few
prayſes) conſented to take vpon them part of the
trauaile. And when certayne of them to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſeuen, were through a generall aſſent at an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyncted
time and place, gathered together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
thereuppon: I reſorted vnto them, bringinge
with mee the booke of Bochas tranſlated by Dan
Lidgate, for the better obſeruation of his order:
which although wee did not miſlyke, yet would it
not conueniently ſerue, ſeing that both Bochas, &amp;
Lidgate were dead, neither were there any alyue
that had medled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to whom the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
might make their moane. To make ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a ſtate meete for the matter, they al agreed that
I ſhoulde vſurpe Bochas rome, and the wretched
Princes complaine vnto me: and toke vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
euery man for his part to be ſundry perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and in their behalfes to bewaile vnto me their
ſundry chaunces, heauy deſtenies, and wofull miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.
This done, wee opened ſutch Bookes of
Chronicles as wee had there preſent, and Maiſter
Ferrers after hee had founde where Bochas left,
which was about the ende of Kinge Edward the
thirdes raigne, to begin the matter, ſayd thus.</p>
            <p>I maruayle (ꝙ hee) what Bochas meaneth to
forget among his myſerable Princes, ſuch as were
of our Nation, whoſe number is as great as theyr

Aduentures wonderfull. For to let paſſe all, both
<hi>Britaynes, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> and to come to the laſt
Conqueſt, what a ſort are they, and ſome alſo in the
time of Bochas himſelfe, or not much before. As for
example William Rufus the ſecond kinge of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande
after the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt, eyther by malice or miſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
ſlayne hunting in the new foreſt, by Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Tirrell with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhot of an arrow. Robert Duke
of <hi>Normandy</hi> eldeſt ſonne to William Conquerour
depriued of his inheritaunce of England, by Henry
his youngeſt brother hauing both his eyes put out,
and after, myſerably impriſoned in Cardiffe Caſtel,
whereas hee died. The moſt Lamentable caſe of
William, Rychard, and Mary, children of the ſayde
Henry the firſt called Beauclerke, drowned vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
Sea by the negligence of drunken Mariners, and
Kynge Rychard the fyrſt ſlaine with a quarel in his

Artur Duke of <hi>Britayne</hi> right Heyre of Englande,
by king Ihon his vncle, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the death of Iſabell his
Siſter by Famyne. The myſerable ende of the ſayd
king Ihon their vncle by Surfet, or as ſome write
poyſoned by a Monke of the Abbey of <hi>Swinſted</hi> in
Lyncolneſhrye. Are not their Hiſtories ruful, and of
rare Example? But as it ſhould appeare, Bochas
being an <hi>Italian,</hi> minded moſt the <hi>Romayne,</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talike</hi>
Story, or els perhaps hee wanted the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

with the murder of many notable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
happened, (for Iacke as yee knowe was but a
poore Prince) I wil begin with a notable example,
which within a while after enſued. And although
the perſon (at whom I beginne) was no kinge nor
Prince: yet ſithens he had a Princely office, I wil
take vpon mee the miſerable perſon of Syr Robert
Treſilian chiefe Iuſtice of <hi>Englande,</hi> and of other

and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this title, Thearle of March:
for as it appereth, there were three men of three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
nations together in one time entituled by that
honour: firſt ſir Edmund Mortimer, whom Owe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
kept in Priſon, an Engliſhman: the ſecond y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord
George of Dunbar a valiaunt Scot, baniſhed out
of his countrey, &amp; well eſteemed of Henry the .iiij:
the third Lord Iames of Bourbon a Frenchman,
ſent by the French king to helpe Owen Glendour.
Theſe three men had this title all at once, which
cauſed him to aſke how it was true that euery one
of theſe coulde be Earle of Marche: whereto was
aunſwered, that euery countrey hath Marches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
vnto them, &amp; thoſe ſo large, that they were
Earldomes, &amp; the Lords thereof intituled thereby:
ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord Edmu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Mortimer was Earle of Marche
in England, lorde Iames of Burbo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Marches
of Fraunce, and Lord George of Dunbar Earle of
the Marches in Scotland. For otherwiſe neyther
could haue intereſt in others title. This dout thus
diſſolued, maiſter Ferrers ſayd: if no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Percies, let vs paſſe the times both of
Henry the fourth, and the fift, and come to Henry y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:660:31"/>
ſixt, in whoſe time Fortune (as ſhe doth in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority
of Princes) bare a great ſtroke among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
And yet in Henry the fourths time are exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
which I would wiſh Baldwin y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you ſhoulde
not forget, as the conſpiracy made by the Byſhop
of Yorcke, and the Lord Mowbray, ſonne of him
whom you late treated of: pricked forward by the
Earle of Northumberland, father to ſir Henry Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpur,
who fled himſelfe, but his partners were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
&amp; put to death, with Baynton and Blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſops,
which could not ſe their duty to their king
but tooke parte wyth Percy that baniſhed Rebell.
As he was proceedinge, hee was deſired to ſtay by
one which had pondered the ſtory of the Percies,
who briefly ſayde. To the ende Baldwin that you
may knowe what to ſaye of the Percies, whoſe
ſtory is not all out of memory (and it is an notable
ſtory) I wyll take vpon me the perſon of the Lord
Henry Percy Earle of Northumberland, father
of Syr Henry Hotſpur, in whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
this may be ſayde as
followeth.

whatſoeuer prince deſireth to lyue quietly without
rebellion muſt doe his ſubiectes right in al thinges

thus ſhal they be ſure from all Rebellion. And for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Therefore let him go and wyth him the Biſhop, and

by ſome ſly drift of the Duke of Yorke, who ſhortly

goinge northward to prepare an army, in the waye
at Sayncte Albanes: Who for want of a ſufficient
power to take the field, was forced with ſutch ſmal
power as he had about him, to defend the Lanes, &amp;
backſydes of the towne, and to ſend out the Duke
of Buckingham for a treaty, which the Duke of
Yorke beinge head of the contrary faction, woulde
not allow without fyrſt hauinge the Duke of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet
and other at his will, duringe which treaty
Richard Neuill Earle of Warwike, the ſtout main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayner
of yorckes title entred the Towne by force,
fought a Battayle in the high ſtreat, where of the
Kinges part were ſlayne the ſayd Duke of Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet

or Kinge Henry are a good Philoſopher ſo
narrowly to argue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſes of miſfortunes?
but there is nothinge to experience which taught,
or might teach the kinge this leſſon.</p>
            <p>But to proceede in our matter: I fynde mention
here ſhortly after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of this king, of a Duke of
Exceſter founde deade in the ſea betwene Douer &amp;
Calais, but what hee was, or by what aduenture
he died, maiſter Fabian hath not ſhewed, and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
Hall hath ouerſkipped him: ſo that excepte we
be frendlier vnto him, he is like to be double drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
both in ſea, and in the gulfe of forgetfulnes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this matter was much talke, but becauſe one
tooke vpon him to ſeeke out that ſtory, that charge
was committed to him.</p>
            <p>And to be occupied in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane while I haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
the ſtory of one drowned likewiſe, and that ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
though priuily, that all the world knew of it
wherefore I ſayd: becauſe night approcheth, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
we will looſe no time, yee ſhall heare what I haue
noted concerning the Duke of Clarence, king
Edwards brother, who al to be waſhed
in Wyne, may bewayle his infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
after this maner.

called by the Rhetoricians Decorum, is ſpecially to

Richard neuer kept meaſure in any of his doinges,
ſeeing alſo he ſpeaketh in Hel, wheras is no order: it
were againſt the Decorum of his perſonage to vſe
eyther good meeter or order.</p>
            <p>And therfore if his Oration were far worſe, in my
opinion it were more fytt for him. Mars and the
Muſes did neuer agree. Neither is to bee ſuffered
that their myld ſacred Arte ſhould ſeeme to procede
from ſo cruel and prophane a mouth as his: ſeinge
they themſelues do abhorre it.</p>
            <p>And although we reade of Nero, that hee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

of his Oration is very wel kept: it ſhal paſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
