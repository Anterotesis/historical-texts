            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Great Preparations</hi> of <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> have this laſt Age ſo vainly and extravagantly prevailed on the minds of ſome men, and they have been ſo ſtrangely enamoured, what with the <hi>Charming Curioſities</hi> of it, and what with the kind accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chymical Medicines</hi> to the difficult Palats of divers Patients, that they have wholly addicted themſelves to the <hi>Preparations</hi> of this Art, and have beyond all reaſon undervalued all the good <hi>Preparations</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or the <hi>Old Phyſicians,</hi> as if they were moſt <hi>Impure, Improper,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52455:9"/>
and <hi>Ineffectual</hi> in themſelves. It is very <hi>Natural</hi> to men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to value themſelves more than is needful on the Particular Acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own <hi>Induſtry,</hi> and what does likewiſe carry ſome <hi>Myſtery</hi> along with it, that is not underſtood by every body. What is commonly <hi>known,</hi> is as commonly <hi>deſpiſed,</hi> let it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of us never ſo well. And <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry</hi> had a great advantage accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, meerly on the account of its firſt <hi>Myſteriouſneſs;</hi> and the <hi>(vain-) Glory</hi> of being an <hi>Adep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> in an <hi>Art</hi> ſo ſeemingly <hi>Uſeful,</hi> did ſwell up <hi>Operators</hi> with a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er opinion of themſelves, than their <hi>Pains</hi> did really deſerve. For it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no leſs than to <hi>ſeparate</hi> all <hi>Natural Impurities</hi> from <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> to <hi>Refine</hi> and <hi>Purifie</hi> them after a new manner, and to give the <hi>true Virtues</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of all
<pb facs="tcp:52455:9"/>
bodies, without any <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their <hi>Uſeleſs, Diſagreeable,</hi> or <hi>Poiſonous Malignant Parts. Herbs</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> and the like, which had been the ſubject matter of <hi>Phyſick</hi> from the beginning of the World 'till then, they ranked in the loweſt and meanest <hi>Claſs</hi> of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Medica,</hi> if they allowed them <hi>any</hi> place at all; but <hi>Metals</hi> and <hi>Minerals</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi> had hid out of our eye, and doubtleſs for very good reaſon, were the only things they thought worthy of eſſaying their Skill upon, and becauſe they would not yield out ſuppoſed <hi>Principles</hi> without Strong and durable <hi>Fires,</hi> much pains, care, and attendance, they concluded every thing to be ſo much the <hi>better,</hi> as it required <hi>Art,</hi> Dexterity, and Labour to unlock and reſolve them into ſeveral <hi>Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52455:10"/>It cannot be denied, but <hi>Phyſick</hi> has in ſome reſpects been improved by the advantages of this <hi>Art,</hi> and as it is made a <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and is uſed by <hi>Sober Phyſicians,</hi> the World is really the better for it; but as it is <hi>ſeparately</hi> managed, and <hi>Chymical Medicines</hi> do become <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive</hi> of all others, it carries grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger and miſchief with it, than every body can imagine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phyſick</hi> it ſelf is a moſt <hi>Noble,</hi> and moſt <hi>Uſeful Art,</hi> and even in <hi>Barbarous Countries,</hi> where for ſome time they were deſtitute of <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> they never ſubſiſted without <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick:</hi> They had learned of the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> to expoſe ſick people openly to the view of all paſſengers, and to deplore the adviſe of any body that would beſtow it; they ſerved themſelves of a fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous,
<pb facs="tcp:52455:10"/>
caſual, and <hi>Empirical</hi> way of <hi>Curing,</hi> where they were not ſo <hi>Happy</hi> as to have perſons make it their only buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and joyn the dictates of an <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Reaſon</hi> to guide their <hi>Remedies</hi> ſafely through the dangerous adventures of uncertain, and <hi>meer Experiments.</hi> The <hi>Romans,</hi> who had a long time minded nothing but <hi>Wars,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had not that value for <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Learned Arts,</hi> which they really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and who had been deſtitute of <hi>Phyſicians</hi> for many hundred years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> were ſaid to have ſworn among themſelves (a moſt uncharitable ſuppoſition!<note place="margin">Plin. l. <hi>29.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>

that great Writer, was an <hi>Arabian Prince.</hi> But not to mention our <hi>Great</hi> ones of the World, we have the Greateſt inſtance, in favour of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> that ever appeared, or could appear to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maker</hi> of the whole World, the <hi>Great Governour</hi> of all things, was pleaſed to <hi>Honour</hi> our <hi>Art</hi> above all others, by executing the Office of a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,</hi> though a <hi>Supernatural</hi> one, by healing mens infirmities, and <hi>going about</hi> thus <hi>doing good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There's much uſeful <hi>Truth,</hi> as well as <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> in that <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <hi>38.</hi>
               </note> Chapter of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticus,</hi> as that <hi>of the moſt high cometh Healing,</hi> v. <hi>2.</hi> that <hi>the Lord hath created the Phyſician,</hi> v. <hi>1. &amp; 12.</hi> and <hi>his Medicines,</hi> v. <hi>4.</hi> and that his Bleſſing goes along with them, v. <hi>13, 14.</hi> that the employment is <hi>Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> v. <hi>1, 2, 3.</hi> and abſolutely <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52455:12"/>
v. <hi>12.</hi> If a man has any ſenſe of <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> any <hi>Humanity</hi> in his nature, what can be more <hi>agreeable</hi> to the bottom of his <hi>Soul,</hi> what more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful in its ſelf, what more <hi>worthy</hi> of us, as we are <hi>Men,</hi> and as we are <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> than to be thus continually ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our time, in order to the relief of Mankind in ſome of their greateſt <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries</hi> which can befall them, their <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> and <hi>Infirmities?</hi> He that is <hi>Sick</hi> to purpoſe, can be ſenſible of what I ſay, and thoſe that are <hi>Phyſicians</hi> in <hi>reality,</hi> whoſe <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Inclination</hi> do go along with their <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> whoſe <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> in it are their <hi>Chiefeſt Delight,</hi> will find their <hi>Heart</hi> atteſt this, and much more.</p>
            <p>But it is the unhappineſs of this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> to be more invaded in the main by all ſorts of People, than any other whatſoever. And therefore that <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52455:12"/>
was much in the right, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that there were <hi>more Phyſicians,</hi> than of any other Employment; and in order to convince his <hi>Prince</hi> of this truth, he hudled up his head, and pretended a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Tooth-ach;</hi> but appearing abroad notwithſtanding, every man that he met with, who enquired into his ailment, very readily adviſed him to ſome <hi>Remedy</hi> or other. He entred their <hi>Names</hi> into his <hi>Note-book,</hi> and in two or three days time, demonſtrated to his <hi>Prince</hi> (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought the <hi>Opinion</hi> a <hi>Paradox</hi>) what a number of <hi>Practitioners</hi> in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> if not <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> he had already met with.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Real Phyſician</hi> is a <hi>Real Happineſs</hi> to the place he lives in, and all <hi>Ignorant, Superficial,</hi> and <hi>Pragmatical</hi> inter-medlers in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> who have but little inſpection into the <hi>Principles</hi> of this <hi>Art,</hi> are as much the
<pb facs="tcp:52455:13"/>
Bane and Peſt of mens Healths, and do as much hurt to the Publick, as thoſe others do certain good. And whatever for <hi>Curioſity</hi> of men may flatter them, it is a greater truth than they are aware, that it is infinitely better for themſelves, and others, that they underſtood nothing at all of Phyſick, than only a little; for the firſt qualification ſecures them from committing errors, and miſchiefs of this kind, the other only furniſhes them with an <hi>unreaſonable Boldneſs,</hi> that is always liable to <hi>dangerous hazards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know that in favour of <hi>Empirical</hi> undertakings, the great <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Good Adviſe</hi> is commonly objected. But as far as my Knowledge of others has gone, I have generally found it to be a groundleſs <hi>Miſtake;</hi> for in this <hi>Famous City,</hi> where the <hi>Encouragement</hi> of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is very remarkable, and deſervedly too, <hi>Eminent</hi> and <hi>Excellent</hi> Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb facs="tcp:52455:13"/>
do not love to grate on the neceſſities of indigent people, but are as free to do good, according to mens <hi>own terms</hi> and <hi>capacities,</hi> as their heart can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably wiſh. They are not the beſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, but the worſt Pretenders, who ſqueeze and gaul men without any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; thoſe in this <hi>City</hi> who have tried it, do ſufficiently know, that there is as free and welcome acceſs to Eminent Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at certain times, by ordinary people, for their <hi>Modicum,</hi> or even for <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> as by the better ſort for a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> proportionable to the juſt <hi>Merit</hi> of the <hi>Faculty.</hi> And in ſome other <hi>Countries,</hi> where the <hi>Common Fees</hi> are cheaper than here, I have heard there is a moſt Rigid Payment required and made, and thoſe who often eſcape here with the Eaſie Payment of <hi>Good Words</hi> only, would take it very unkindly, to have their <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Relations</hi> body detained by <hi>Authority</hi> above ground, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb facs="tcp:52455:14"/>
their Phyſician is ſatisfied for his Pains, as I have heard is not very ſeldom done, in a <hi>Country</hi> not far from us. It is not in Phyſick only, but in all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions that our <hi>Nation</hi> does ſhew its <hi>Native,</hi> and <hi>Inſeparable Generoſity;</hi> a Peaſant here ſhall <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> much better than many a <hi>Gentleman</hi> abroad; and where <hi>Money</hi> does Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>Circulate</hi> with a free and <hi>liberal</hi> hand, upon all imaginable occaſions, it would be very incongruous, that a leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue ſhould be put upon mens <hi>Healths,</hi> than upon every thing elſe beſides.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of this diſcourſe is handled with ſo little <hi>Obſcurity,</hi> that there is the leſs need of a <hi>Clavis</hi> to illuſtrate it, or of <hi>Ceremony</hi> to introduce you to it. I wiſh it may but prove as <hi>Uſeful</hi> as I deſign it. And the variety may afford ſome <hi>Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> at leaſt, where the <hi>Excellency</hi> of mens <hi>Judgments</hi> may prevent their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Profit, by plain, but wholeſome <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Wars between <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> and <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> very fierce for ſome time; but end at laſt in a Peace. The Deſign opened. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> wiſe, and excellent, but not infallible. A ſlaviſh Expreſſion of a <hi>Venetian.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> began to ſound its Alarm, under the Banner of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and the noiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo great, as to ſhake the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> divers eminent <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> took their Weapons in their hands, and with a learned Pen, did ſufficiently
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52455:17"/>
vindicate the Honour of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> from the bold attempts of their declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But this angry Invader of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenick Art,</hi> did ſoon ſtrengthen himſelf by a great many Followers, who all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired together to carry Fire and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction whitherſoever they went. <hi>Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi> muſt be all with them, or nothing. And all the contemptible ſcandals, and marks of Ignominy, that Malice could invent, were very liberally beſtowed on all that favoured Learning, or aſſerted the <hi>Ancient Principles</hi> of <hi>Phyſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that there was no Parley between the two Parties, in order to a Peaceable and right underſtanding; the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> if it had been poſſible, would have maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred, and utterly cut off all the <hi>Galenick Profeſſors,</hi> and the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt indignation of injur'd Perſons, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried and condemned all <hi>Chymical</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and many Acts of Hoſtility and open War, were for a long time carried on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Inſomuch, that there was no hopes of an Accommodation, no ſigns of Moderation, or Peace, till both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had ſufficiently worried one another, till their Weapons were blunted with frequent Skirmiſhes, and both grew wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their unreaſonable Contentions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52455:17"/>And then the Foundations of <hi>Phyſick</hi> appeared firmer than was thought, and <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> was found to contain ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, that were not to be deſpiſed. The Anger and Venom was pretty well ſpent on both ſides, and after the violent Storms had continued as long as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Violent things would ſuffer, the Weather cleared up again, and every man leaſurely conſidered what was the real Matter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Phyſicians</hi> of thoſe dayes did not at laſt ſcorn to foul their Fingers with <hi>Coals,</hi> as well as <hi>Ink.</hi> They built them <hi>Laboratories,</hi> procured <hi>Veſſels</hi> of all ſorts, and were as buſie at <hi>Chymical preparations,</hi> as the firſt <hi>Operators</hi> themſelves. In the mean time the paſſionate Aſſertors of <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> took Books into their hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, read, and leaſurely conſidered, and at laſt found, thoſe I mean that grew <hi>Sober,</hi> that a <hi>Judicious Adminiſtration</hi> of <hi>Medicines,</hi> would do the beſt no harm at all, that there was as much dexterity and Art, in the right uſe of <hi>Chymical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> as in the very <hi>Preparations</hi> they ſo much delighted in. And thus by degrees the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> grew <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> became <hi>Phyſicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52455:18"/>Great Beginnings are naturally imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and attended with Faults; and though the firſt undertakers are impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of Contradiction, yet generally their Succeſſors make Additions that were not at firſt thought of. We all know, that the firſt <hi>Projectors</hi> of any thing do ſeldom thrive, or perfectly attain their end, but the ſecond Undertakers do often grow rich upon it, and avoid thoſe manifold Inconveniencies that were not foreſeen by the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> is now one neceſſary part of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and a man can no more pretend to be a <hi>Phyſician</hi> without a competent knowledg in it, than a Mechanick work without his Tools. If it be not eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond all degrees of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> and arrogantly buoyed up above <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> it will be found excellent in ſome no mean reſpects, and add both <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> to ſome <hi>Medicines,</hi> that were more loathſom to the Palate, and more ineffectual in their Operation before. Out <hi>Modern Phyſicians</hi> are now the only <hi>Chymiſts</hi> in reality, and all other ſmall dealers or ignorant <hi>Retainers</hi> to that <hi>Art,</hi> will prove <hi>Impoſtors</hi> and <hi>Pſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-Chymiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52455:18"/>The Deſign therefore of this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe is not to bid defiance to <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> right or wrong, but to offer a fair Repreſentation of things as they are in themſelves, to give a check to all malapert Pretenders, and to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <hi>Natural Remedies,</hi> that are very good as Nature provides them, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwallowed up, or over-powred with a <hi>Scenical Parade,</hi> as if nothing were good for any thing that had not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the <hi>Teſt</hi> of <hi>Chymical Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> is ſo bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Art,</hi> and ſo ſuits with the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fondneſs of Mankind, who are too apt to admire themſelves, and the <hi>Works</hi> of their own <hi>Hands,</hi> that ſometimes <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous,</hi> and otherwiſe underſtanding men, run farther in it than they ought, and their <hi>Reaſon</hi> is often <hi>blinded,</hi> with giving too much way to their <hi>Affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Subject therefore that I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, is ſo Noble, and really uſeful, that I wiſh with all my Heart, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Pen would have done it better. I have rather but hinted at what might have been well performed, than fully decided the Subjects of this Diſcourſe. And I hope it will be no Diſſervice to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52455:19"/>
my Faculty, to do the beſt that my ſmall Capacity can for them, and to ſhew how much more is requiſite to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a good Phyſician, beſides being converſant among Fires and Furnaces, beſides the <hi>beſt Preparation</hi> of <hi>Remedies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> will be ever famous to after-ages, becauſe their <hi>Works</hi> are full of ſound ſenſe, well digeſted Principles, and undeniable Truths. And thoſe who keenly ſpeak againſt them, and rail at their Labours with much earneſtneſs, either do not underſtand them, or are very moroſe in their natural Tempers.</p>
               <p>And yet I am not of <hi>Macrobius</hi> his mind,<note place="margin">In Somn. Scipion. <hi>lib. 1. c. 6.</hi>
                  </note> who in a fond rant brake out into this hearty expreſſion concerning our great <hi>Hippocrates, Quòd tàm fallere, quàm falli neſciat,</hi> that he was neither capable of teaching an Error, nor of being in an Error himſelf.<note place="margin">Apol. <hi>3. l. 3. diſp. 3.</hi> cap. ult.</note> And ſo <hi>Maſſarias</hi> paſſes the ſame Complement upon <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle, Quòd nunquam, ſi rectè intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantur, fallere, vel falli poſſint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twould be exceeding happy for the World, if it could have been furniſhed with ſuch <hi>infallible Dictators</hi> in <hi>Phyſick.</hi> All Doubts and Queſtions would then have been laid aſide, and an <hi>Ipſe Dixit</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52455:19"/>
would have eaſily decided all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that riſe in our way. But though Quacks and Idiots can ſee ſo far into the Virtues of a <hi>Pill</hi> or <hi>Powder,</hi> that it ſhall <hi>infallibly</hi> do every thing they would have it, and can never be directed to a wrong Intention, yet <hi>Phyſicians</hi> we find, who ought in reaſon to be preſumed to have as good <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Brains,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceited Fools, and illiterate Pretenders, are very unhappy men, that all their Knowledg and Obſervation ſhould only ſerve to hinder them from diſcovering the <hi>Panacea</hi>'s, and mighty <hi>Catholicon</hi>'s, that lye open to every careleſs eye; that they only ſhould continue <hi>Pro</hi>-ing and <hi>Con</hi>-ing, whilſt every Blockhead never fails to be in the right.</p>
               <p>No, 'tis the unavoidable condition of Humane Nature, of the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> men, as well as <hi>Ignorant,</hi> to be often ſubject to <hi>Miſtake,</hi> and much Care, Pains, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, if not Good Fortune too, are requiſite to free the very <hi>beſt</hi> of us from being too too prone to our <hi>Common Fate.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>SOme to advance the Honour and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> high enough, have thought fit to derive it from our firſt Father <hi>Adam,</hi> and would needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that no ſooner was he endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> but he ſoon became a <hi>Chymiſt;</hi> that he not only gave unto all <hi>Creatures</hi> their <hi>Proper Names,</hi> but alſo extended his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> over the <hi>Mineral Kingdom;</hi> that he not only cultivated the Earth, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52455:20"/>
labour'd hard with the <hi>ſweat of his Brows,</hi> but was profoundly skilled in the deepeſt Arts and Sciences. He that firſt found this out, was doubtleſs a notable man, and had an Imagination ſo keen and ſearching, that he ſeems very well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the utmoſt attainments of <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry,</hi> for finding out the <hi>Philoſophers Stone,</hi> whereſoever it lies hid.</p>
               <p>Others have been a little ſhorter-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made <hi>Tubalcain</hi> to be the <hi>firſt Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> tells us, <hi>he wrought cunningly every Craft of Braſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4.22.</note> 
                  <hi>and of Iron.</hi> But it will hardly follow, to every mans underſtanding, that a good Braſier, or Smith, muſt of neceſſity be a curious <hi>Chymiſt.</hi> A <hi>Farrier</hi> may by degrees, 'tis poſſible, arrive at ſtrange Perfection; but if he <hi>deſerts</hi> his <hi>Trade,</hi> to ſet up in the ways of <hi>Alchymy,</hi> it is more than probable, that the man will at laſt make but a poor, and beggarly Concluſion. This ſame <hi>Tubalcain</hi> is thought to be the Poets <hi>Vulcan;</hi> but though they were very well skill'd in the Art of Invention, and he was their <hi>God of Fire,</hi> and for that Reaſon might eaſily have been conducted from his <hi>Forge</hi> into a <hi>Laboratory,</hi> yet none of them (that I know of) have aſcribed to him this Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52455:21"/>Therefore thoſe were ſomewhat the wiſer, who were contented to make <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Triſmegiſtus</hi> to be the Man; for from him it is ſtill called the <hi>Hermetick Art, Hermetick Veſſels,</hi> and the <hi>Hermetick Seal.</hi> This <hi>Hermes,</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi> was doubtleſs ancient enough. And though there were divers of this Name, the <hi>Aegyptian Hermes</hi> was the chief, that <hi>Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib 2.</note> and others, do aſcribe the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Learning to. And this man was as great, as Learning could make him, or his Name imports. He is ſaid to have written an infinite Number of Books, and ſome of <hi>Phyſick. Cicero</hi> ſays, he was not only Governor of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> being <hi>skill'd in all the Learning of the</hi> Aegyptians, was therefore eaſily imagined to have no ſmall skill in <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry.</hi>

And there's no ſuch Myſtery in that. But

we muſt allow ſome Grains to the over-Admirers of any Art. A ſmall Argument will be a good one, when they are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make it out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> indeed was a <hi>Chymiſt</hi> to the purpoſe, having the <hi>right Philoſophers Stone,</hi> not that which many have in vain ſought for, and reduced themſelves to the utmoſt degree of Pitty and Poverty in hopes to attain, but the <hi>inexhauſtible Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Gods extraordinary Bleſſing,</hi> the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal affluence of all that the Heart of man could covet, or Eye could behold. But his Miraculous Plenty was beſtowed on him, as a Reward for his generous Election of Wiſdom and Knowledg; whereas commonly our fooliſh <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers by Fire</hi> do ſpend their time in queſt of the <hi>Tincture,</hi> purely to gratifie a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> Mind, and to make themſelves <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in ſome new <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> where they hope to take and enjoy a full ſwinge of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality.</p>
               <p>But again, this <hi>Great,</hi> this <hi>Wiſeſt Man,</hi> was in effect a <hi>True Galeniſt;</hi> he treated of the Virtues of <hi>Simples</hi> from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the loweſt, from the tall <hi>Cedar</hi> in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> to the <hi>Hyſop upon the Wall.</hi> We are certain, he knew the excellency of all thoſe <hi>Simple Medicaments,</hi> which lie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52455:22"/>
every where ready to our hands, and our Eye cannot chooſe but ſee, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ript up the Bowels of the Earth, and examined thoſe <hi>Minerals</hi> that lye hid and covered in darkneſs, we have no ſuch reaſon to conjecture.</p>
               <p>And <hi>this</hi> very <hi>Conſideration,</hi> that the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> man in the World did think fit to employ his thoughts, and write a Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Treatiſe</hi> on purpoſe concerning the very ſame <hi>Simples</hi> which every <hi>Phyſician</hi> muſt, and does ſtudy and apply to, does very much weigh with me to think <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> and <hi>Minerals</hi> are not ſo <hi>Properly,</hi> ſo <hi>Naturally,</hi> the <hi>Sphere</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> as <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Herbs,</hi> and what this Great and <hi>Wiſe Prince</hi> treated of. Not that I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly derogate from the real, and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick value of any thing whatſoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be derived from the <hi>Mineral, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> or <hi>Vegetable Kingdom.</hi> There is not the meaneſt thing in Nature, the moſt odd, or ſeemingly improper, but inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive men have made tryals, and found ſome unqueſtionable <hi>Phyſical uſe</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it.</p>
               <p>And now how ſhall we grieve enough, that a Book of this ineſtimable Worth was preſently loſt, that Mankind ſhould be thus unworthy, of what would in an
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52455:22"/>
reaſon have conduced more to that <hi>great Bleſſing</hi> of mens Lives, <hi>Health,</hi> (without which all Honours, Pleaſures, and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, become inſipid, flat, and worthleſs) than any the weaker endeavours of leſs than a <hi>Solomon.</hi> It is a ſad reflection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and muſt eſpecially be ſo to that <hi>Phyſician,</hi> who is heartily of his Profeſſion, and is concern'd in earneſt at the good or ill events of Remedies. The loſs of the <hi>Sybills Books,</hi> and a thouſand other things long talk'd of, are but imaginary in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with this.

The Nature of Humane Life conſiſts of a certain mixture of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> as neceſſary and inſeparable to every ſtate of Mankind as their very Exiſtence and Being.

Story in the main, but could not forbear interlacing divers palpable untruths, if we found him affect the moſt extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Nonſence, and Impertinence, if he delighted to talk as if he were ſtark Mad, and coined abundance of unintelligible words, as it were on purpoſe not to be underſtood, but by thoſe who were as Mad as himſelf, and therefore imagine they hit his meaning, the mans Folly and Extravagance would be apt to prejudice us ſtrongly againſt the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Whole,</hi> and the very telling would ſpoil all the Truth and Credit of the Story. It is not impoſſible, but a notorious Lyar may ſpeak Truth ſometimes, but when he does, he will hardly gain belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paracelſus</hi> was born in <hi>Switzerland, Ann.</hi> 1493. After he had made a good Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency under the beſt Maſters in <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> that were to be found in <hi>Germany,</hi> he ſwelled ſo big with his Acquiſitions in that <hi>Art,</hi> that the World could hardly contain him.

Names, or Titles of <hi>Dn. Aureolus, Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, Theoploraſtus, Bombaſtus ab Hoenhaim,</hi> or <hi>Paracelſus.</hi> His Works do all along anſwer the Conceitedneſs of his Name. He ſtyled ſome of his Books, <hi>Paramirum, Paragranum, Pagoyum, Azoth,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>His Friend <hi>Oporinus,</hi> who kept him company two years together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be throughly acquainted with his Qualifications,<note place="margin">Epiſt.

               <p>His Excellency conſiſted not only in <hi>Chirurgical</hi> performances, at which he had indiſputably a very Happy Hand, but alſo in a ſuppoſed Expedite Cure of ſuch as are commonly eſteemed (and that Properly too, when grown to a certain height) by Learned and Underſtanding <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> to be <hi>Incurable Diſeaſes;</hi> which if he could really have wrought <hi>Miracles</hi> upon, we would have Admired him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Merit, and have Extoll'd him among the <hi>Demy-Gods,</hi> if he had not <hi>Scorn'd</hi> a Place among them.

                  <hi>Quercetan</hi> was one of the greateſt, and moſt Rational Champions of <hi>Chymiſtry.</hi> He much delighted in it, even from his Youth, inſomuch that when he was but a Young man, he writ a ſmart Book for his Age, <hi>De ſpagyricorum Medicamentorum praeparationibus,</hi> and afterwards when the <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> fell out grievouſly with him, about his uſe of <hi>Chymical Medicines,</hi> that very few of them had then much acquainted themſelves with, he writ an Excellent and Learned Treatiſe, called, <hi>Hermeticae Medicinae Defenſio,</hi> ſhewing great Miſtakes concerning him.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>CHymiſtry,</hi> as it relates to <hi>Phyſick,</hi> may properly be called art <hi>Art,</hi> that teaches us how to Separate the Principles and Virtues of mix'd Bodies. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it <hi>Separates</hi> the Virtues of things, either away into the <hi>Air,</hi> or into <hi>Proper</hi> or <hi>Pernicious Medicines,</hi> becomes <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeleſs,</hi> or <hi>Safe,</hi> or of <hi>Dangerous</hi> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. If we ſhould make an <hi>Extract</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52455:31"/>
of <hi>Aromaticks,</hi> or things of a very <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> Nature, we ſpend our time to no manner of purpoſe, and make a <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that is good for <hi>Nothing.</hi> If we draw out the <hi>Virtues</hi> of ſome Bodies, whether <hi>Mineral, Animal</hi> or <hi>Vegetable,</hi> in a ſuitable <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and by time and gentle degrees of Heat make an efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Tincture,</hi> we aſſiſt Nature with our pains, and furniſh our ſelves with an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Remedy.</hi> Laſtly, if by violent force of Fire, and repeated <hi>Rectifications</hi> and <hi>Cohobations</hi> we render things <hi>Corroſive</hi> to the higheſt degree, and that which was Naturally Mild and Good we make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the Principles of Life, our Remedy proves a Dagger, and the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment becomes Fatal.</p>
               <p>So that certainly it is the True Intereſt of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> to have as right a notion as may be, of either the Goodneſs, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or the Injuriouſneſs of <hi>Chymical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations.</hi> We ought neither to be <hi>Slovens,</hi> nor <hi>over-nice.</hi> And becauſe people are generally apt to run into one Extream, and ſome eſpecially have Magnified the meer Curioſities of Preparation, ſo as to dazle the Eyes of moſt, that they cannot ſee the difference between <hi>Truths</hi> and Counterfeits, between Realities and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52455:32"/>
I ſhall make it the deſign of the following Diſcourſe to unvail ſome things that have been held <hi>Sacred,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Myſterious,</hi> and in every thing to deliver my ſelf with as much Indifference, and as little Prejudice as poſſible.</p>
               <p>And I am ſo far from offering to Dictate <hi>Magiſterially,</hi> or peremptorily Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing my own <hi>Thoughts,</hi> as a certain Rule in theſe matters, that I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rather beſeech my <hi>Reader</hi> not be of my mind, if he finds better Reaſon, or more ſufficient Evidence to the contrary. Our main <hi>End,</hi> that all our Endeavours ought to aim at, muſt be the <hi>Health</hi> and welfare of our Country, and whatever <hi>Notions</hi> are contrary to that <hi>End,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Plauſibly they may be dreſt up, how <hi>Learnedly</hi> ſoever repreſented, we ought to avoid them as ſo many <hi>Rocks,</hi> though the <hi>Sweeteſt Syrens ſing,</hi> and <hi>allure</hi> us to them. And if men had more ſeriouſly adverted to this main <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> they would not have been ſo zealous in the Juſtification of their little home-bred <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> they would not have called <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> together to their aſſiſtance, and ſo impatiently have born any Civil Contradiction to their own Opinions and Miſtakes.

have delighted to be led into the <hi>Right</hi> way, than to <hi>Wander</hi> ſtill on, though an <hi>Ignorant Clown</hi> ſhould ſhew it. But it is the unhappy temper of Mankind in general, (though ſome Countries, as well as perſons, do partake of that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per more generally than others) that they are moſt <hi>unreaſonably averſe</hi> to the <hi>acknowledgment</hi> of an <hi>Error;</hi> and they eſteem it more <hi>Honourable</hi> and <hi>Glorious,</hi> obſtinately to <hi>perſiſt</hi> in an <hi>Error</hi> they have once <hi>Eſpouſed,</hi> than to draw back their Foot into the <hi>Right,</hi> and hazard the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> of <hi>Levity.</hi> We often paſs the <hi>Complement, Humanum eſt Errare,</hi> to others, but would by no means have it thought, we our ſelves can fall under a Miſtake.</p>

               <p>IT has been a general humour with <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> to affect hard and ſtrained Words, to deliver themſelves with a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Obſcurity,</hi> to turn every thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

into <hi>Arcana,</hi> and when they do bring them forth, after much Labour and Travel, the World is hardly big enough to contain them; they would be thought the moſt <hi>Charitable,</hi> and Kindeſt men alive; and at laſt after abundance of <hi>Ceremony,</hi> it appears before us, with ſome ratling, new-coin'd Name. If any thing in nature be Dearer than ordinary, or accounted of greater value, becauſe fetch'd from far, be ſure that muſt be drawn in to conſtitute, or illuſtrate the Title. <hi>Aurum vitae, ſive Hercules Bovii, Mercurius vitae, Aurum Argentum, &amp;</hi> Bezoar <hi>Potabile, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicornu Minerale, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornu Solare, Bezoarticum Joviale, Aquila Imperialis,</hi> &amp;c. are ſome of their <hi>Illuſtrious Titles.</hi> But this I have often obſerv'd, that the more Precious and Thundring a Name is beſtowed on the <hi>Preparation,</hi> commonly the more <hi>Dangerous</hi> and Dreadful it is in reality.

to Patients, to Taſte a little of its Goodneſs. And if you ſhould read concerning it, <hi>Arnoldus de villâ novâ, Raymund Lully, Iſaacus Hollandus,</hi> or <hi>Bombaſtical Paracelſus,</hi> you would find, that they did not aſcribe more Virtues to all their <hi>Emeticks, Catharticks, Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Diureticks, Anodynes, Stypticks, Alexipharmicks,</hi> &amp;c. than they did to this ſingle, but Rich Draught or <hi>Aurum Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile.</hi> So that if any thing in nature (the <hi>Tincture</hi> only excepted) could have obtained the Reputation of a <hi>Panacea,</hi> this muſt in all likelihood have been the very thing. For <hi>Gold</hi> muſt have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd it, let it be what it will; that which will open all Locks, that which will abate the Rigorous Principles of moſt <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and that which will open an entrance into the ſecreteſt <hi>Arcana,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> or others, may be very well allowed to do as many and as great things, as the beſt that can be named. This ſame <hi>Gold</hi> is the <hi>End,</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> that our <hi>Fiery Philoſophers</hi> do Labour, and Sweat for; this is the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial</hi> they ſo earneſtly contend for, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort their drooping Spirits, after ſo many ſereval diſappointments in their broken Veſſels, and fruitleſs repetitions of their

               <p>And yet after all their <hi>Calcinations, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, Extractions, Digeſtions,</hi> and I know not how many different <hi>Tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> of the Glorious <hi>Metal;</hi> what do they attain at laſt in this their <hi>Aurum Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile,</hi> but a meer <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> by <hi>Corroſive Spirits</hi> (whether they do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their <hi>Corroſion</hi> entire, or it be a little abated by ſome <hi>Alkali Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Salts,</hi> it is no great matter which) but the <hi>Gold</hi> is never the better for <hi>Phyſical</hi> Uſe, by this <hi>Artificial Corroſion,</hi> nor the <hi>Spirits</hi> the more Innocent, for being Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with that Noble <hi>Metal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot eaſily conceive, what ſhould cauſe them thus to torture their Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon this <hi>Royal Metal,</hi> unleſs baſely to impoſe on the Vulgar, and adapt their Endeavours to the humours and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the Common people.

               <argument>
                  <p>The Verity of Tranſmutation of <hi>Metals</hi> beſt judged of by Matter of Fact. Some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors mentioned in Defence of it. Yet all pretended Tranſmutations thought to be meer Counterfeits. Adulterations to be cautiouſly treated of. The <hi>Philoſophers Stone</hi> probably a meer Colluſion and Trick. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi>'s point examined. No one <hi>Alchymiſt</hi> ever yet ſo Rich as to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed. An Argument againſt Projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, drawn from Providence. The baſer <hi>Metals</hi> not Tranſmuted. That ſuppoſing the Truth of Projection, it is the greateſt Folly to endeavour after it. The Proceſs always undertaken different ways, though by the Rules of the ſame Author. <hi>Penotus</hi> a ſad Example of what <hi>Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> ought to fear.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS for the <hi>Metallurgia,</hi> or the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Tranſmutation</hi> of <hi>Metals,</hi> it is not a ſubject ſo properly to be decided by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reaſon, as by Tryal and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Let our Reaſonings be never ſo ſtrong and cogent, yet if plain <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> evinces the contrary, we ought
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52455:41"/>
immediately to acquieſce, and ſubmit to the Real Truth.</p>
               <p>Now I muſt confeſs, I never was <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſt</hi> enough, to try the utmoſt that is <hi>Poſſible</hi> to be done in theſe matters. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bavius, Penotus, Hogelande,</hi> &amp;c. do ſtiffly maintain the <hi>Tranſmutation,</hi> as indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, both of <hi>Mercury, Lead,</hi> and the like <hi>Metals</hi> into <hi>Gold,</hi> and of the <hi>viler Metals</hi> into one another. <hi>Sennertus,</hi> a <hi>ſober Author,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Chymic. cum Ariſt. &amp; <hi>Galen.</hi> conſenſ. ac Diſſenſu, cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> is ſo well perſwaded of the <hi>poſſibility,</hi> that he thinks it raſh, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, to deny it. He ſays, there are <hi>Fountains</hi> at <hi>Smolnitium,</hi> a Town in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> which will turn <hi>Iron</hi> into the beſt <hi>Copper.</hi> Nay, that not only <hi>Natural,</hi> but <hi>Artificial Vitriolick Waters</hi> are able to turn <hi>Iron</hi> into <hi>Copper,</hi> a <hi>Red</hi> powder ſticking to the <hi>Iron,</hi> which being Melted, will become a good <hi>Copper.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he taxes <hi>Nicolaus Guibertus</hi> with a greater Impudence than ordinary, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying abſolutely any <hi>Perfect Tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding we have had ſo many plauſible Stories of this, and that mans having gotten the <hi>Tincture,</hi> and almoſt every body fancies he can <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute</hi> the <hi>Viler Metals</hi> with eaſe, yet I cannot tell how to give up my full Aſſent,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52455:41"/>
even to the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> in <hi>any one.</hi> I know things may be <hi>Counterfeited</hi> with great cunning and dexterity, but ſtill the moſt that can be made of them is, that they are <hi>Counterfeits.</hi> And I never yet met with, or heard of any ſuch Colluſion, but that if it be brought to a narrow, and Critical <hi>Teſt,</hi> it may by an Able <hi>Artiſt</hi> be diſtinguiſhed from the True kind. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate two Likes, and you ſhall hardly reſolve which is which; but bring them together, and try the difference, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Art, and you can't eaſily be miſtaken, or impoſed upon. And it is too well known, that <hi>Pſeudo-Chymiſts,</hi> the Spawn, if not Legitimate Iſſue of the more Learned <hi>Alchymiſts,</hi> being bred up, and inſtructed under thoſe Maſters, have ſuch an admirable faculty of <hi>Counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines,</hi> that it is now become a ſet Employment, and there is hardly one that is worth a <hi>Counterfeiting,</hi> that can eſcape their Contrivances, and they are as buſy as Bees, 'till they have found out a Cheat for it. I could here extend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great many things, and lay open their baſe <hi>Adulterations,</hi> in a great many particulars, that I cannot ſo much as think of without <hi>Indignation,</hi> and violent Tranſport; and therefore I had rather
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52455:42"/>
paſs by the particulars, than teach wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men how to do Miſchief. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all <hi>Authors</hi> ſhould be exceeding careful of ſhewing their Knowledge in thoſe baſe Impoſtures. A hint how to diſcover the <hi>Adulteration</hi> does always well, but the other deſerves to be buried in the deepeſt ſilence. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Galen</hi> was very averſe to the <hi>Writing</hi> a <hi>Hiſtory of Poiſons,</hi> leaſt the World might happen to receive from it more Harm than Good, and the <hi>Woolves,</hi> and <hi>Monſters</hi> of <hi>Humane Society</hi> might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by improve their <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The World ſufficiently rings about <hi>Raymund Lully, Arnoldus de villà novâ, Roger Bacon, Kelley, Hogelande, Boethius,</hi> and ſeveral others here and there, as if they were all <hi>ſanctified</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> with the Power of <hi>Projection.</hi> And our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> had the luck to find out a Treaſure of this kind, very lately, being ſtill alive. The Romantick Story was writ by <hi>John Joachim Becher,</hi> and ſaid to be publiſhed at the requeſt of the <hi>Honourable,</hi> and moſt <hi>Eminent</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Magnalia Naturae <hi>Printed in</hi> Black-Fryers 1680.</note> And yet we may obſerve of this <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> that he was one of the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Libertines</hi> upon Earth in his <hi>Moralls,</hi> that notwithſtanding he had a very large
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52455:42"/>
                  <hi>Pot</hi> of this <hi>Powder</hi> of <hi>Projection,</hi> enough one would think to have <hi>bought Empires</hi> with, yet his <hi>Pot</hi> had a <hi>Bottom</hi> in about two years time, and he grew to be one of the moſt Wretched <hi>Notorious Cheats</hi> that ever pretended to <hi>Alchymy.</hi> He was dip'd over Head and Ears in Debts of all ſorts, and was fain to vend <hi>Poudred Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar, Red Lead, and the Caput Mortuum of Aqua Fortis boiled,</hi> and ſuch like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients inſtead of the <hi>Genuine Powder,</hi> mixing alſo therewith ſome <hi>Filings</hi> of <hi>Copper,</hi> to make it appear the more Glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and <hi>Gold</hi>-like. The <hi>Grand Elixir</hi> at firſt hearing of, and after having paſſed an Ordinary Teſt, ſtrikes men with ſuch Admiration and Reverence, that they are as unwilling ſtrictly to Examine all its <hi>Natural</hi> qualifications, as to diſpute the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> they pay <hi>Worſhip</hi> to, or the <hi>Power</hi> of a <hi>Mighty Monarch</hi> that they live under. If there be a true <hi>Tranſmutation,</hi> as I cannot but ſomewhat doubt, the Trade ſhall certainly make a man a <hi>Beggar</hi> inſtead of an <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the Expence that is employed about bringing it to a <hi>Tinging Perfection,</hi> ſhall abundantly over-weigh the Profit that it is to produce. We have had no ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Alchymiſts</hi> in our own days, who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52455:43"/>
were many of them born to fair <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and yet all after much <hi>Bragging, Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting,</hi> and <hi>Lying,</hi> have grown <hi>Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly Poor</hi> and <hi>Miſerable.</hi> If ever <hi>one</hi> of them had born up againſt the <hi>Stream,</hi> and ſurmounted the neceſſary conſequences of <hi>Folly;</hi> if <hi>one</hi> of them all had hapned to appear as Pompous as they aimed, in any other, than the <hi>Fools Paradice,</hi> it had been a better Argument for the Reality of <hi>Projection,</hi> than a thouſand <hi>Tricks</hi> and <hi>Stratagems,</hi> that they have been certainly Guilty of, and which have at ſeveral times been <hi>diſcovered</hi> to the World.</p>
               <p>I ſhall urge one <hi>Conſideration</hi> more, upon the <hi>Suppoſition</hi> of the <hi>Philoſophers Stone,</hi> that there may be, or has been ſuch a thing unqueſtionably, and without diſguiſe: I offer, whether it be conſiſtent with the <hi>Eſtabliſhed</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nalterable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> over the World, that one man ſhould have that advantage over his Fellow-creatures, as to multiply Riches without end, as it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that man may, who is Perfect Maſter of this <hi>Secret.</hi> I never underſtood yet, but we are all born to Toyl and Labour, and all ſubject to the various <hi>Revolutions</hi> of <hi>Fortune.</hi> The <hi>Greateſt Monarch</hi> is ſubject to the ſame <hi>Laws</hi> of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52455:43"/>
                  <hi>Nature</hi> with <hi>Boors</hi> and <hi>Peaſants;</hi> he is not out of the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of being <hi>Robb'd</hi> of all his <hi>Wealth,</hi> of being <hi>Deſpiſed,</hi> or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned even by his <hi>Vaſſals.</hi> And there are <hi>Bounds</hi> determined by <hi>Providence,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which the moſt <hi>Ambitious Prince</hi> can never paſs. But granting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of <hi>All powerful Projection,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> are ſubject to be <hi>overwhelmed,</hi> by the Inexhauſtible <hi>Purſe</hi> of a <hi>Whimſical Philoſopher Paramount.</hi> So that I cannot but neceſſarily conclude, that if the <hi>Tinger's Artificial Gold</hi> had been Con'd over again and again, ſome <hi>Flaw</hi> or other would have been diſcovered in the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Jewel,</hi> and the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> would have been ſoon tumbled down from his imaginary <hi>Royalty</hi> in the <hi>Mineral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Tranſmutation</hi> of other <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> into one another, though there's no ſuch danger of loſiing <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Liberty</hi> by being known to do ſuch Feats, yet it is a rare thing to meet with an <hi>Alchymiſt</hi> that will offer to convince us throughly even in thoſe matters. I know ſome will talk as if they could do every thing in nature, and ſay what they will, they will take it very unkindly to be Contradicted in their Bold Pretences. But I never heard of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52455:44"/>
any yet, who offered to ſet up for the <hi>Merchant,</hi> and <hi>Traffick'd</hi> with <hi>Copper</hi> for <hi>Coals.</hi> Some of them perhaps have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their <hi>Neck</hi> to make <hi>Pieces</hi> of <hi>Eight,</hi> and will ſhew you a <hi>Medal</hi> or two which may paſs off much as well, as a <hi>Gilded Braſs-Ring.</hi> They will make you a <hi>Silver</hi> at <hi>Half a Crown</hi> an <hi>Ounce,</hi> and this <hi>Silver</hi> may be work'd into a <hi>Plate Veſſel</hi> juſt as <hi>Wholeſome</hi> as <hi>Copper</hi> it ſelf.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52455:48"/>
is a thing that will be apt to <hi>ſowre</hi> ſooner than we are aware, and <hi>Apothecaries</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe hands it has hapned to <hi>ſowre,</hi> will be apt rather to uſe that, ſuch as it is, which they have ready by them, than to <hi>Diſtil</hi> afreſh upon every <hi>ſmall</hi> occaſion, or fancy.

in my opinion, than according to others in a <hi>Reverberatory.</hi> Such kind of <hi>Heats</hi> are not ſo <hi>Violent,</hi> nor do they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute that <hi>ſtrong Impreſſion</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> which muſt needs be communicated by the way of a <hi>Reverberatory.</hi> And the interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Water</hi> or <hi>Sand,</hi> beſides the <hi>Furnace</hi> wherein the <hi>Veſſel</hi> is placed, are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable circumſtances to <hi>preſerve</hi> the <hi>Diſtilled Liquors</hi> from a too great Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of <hi>Fire.</hi> And howſoever <hi>Fond Chymiſts,</hi> or <hi>Bigotted Operators</hi> may ſmile at the imagination, that their <hi>Adored,</hi> and all-powerful <hi>Vulcan</hi> can do any <hi>hurt</hi> to <hi>Remedies,</hi> yet upon calm thoughts, and an impartial conſideration they will at length find, that <hi>Fire</hi> in its full force is a moſt <hi>Deſtructive Conſuming Principle,</hi> and that we ought in Conſcience to be very tender and timorous in the uſe of ſuch <hi>Medicines,</hi> as have plentifully received, and I may ſay, <hi>Imbodied Fire</hi> into their very <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and Eſſential Compoſition.</p>
               <p>The difference between a <hi>Real Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> and a <hi>Quack-Pretender,</hi> does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly appear in this, that the <hi>firſt</hi> is <hi>Cautious, Deliberate,</hi> and <hi>Prudently Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> in all <hi>Doubtful</hi> caſes, or <hi>Dangerous</hi> circumſtances, he does generally to others, in their ſeveral degrees, as he would be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52455:51"/>
content to be dealt withall himſelf under the ſame circumſtances; the <hi>Latter</hi> is <hi>Raſh, Inconſiderate,</hi> and ſtifly <hi>heady</hi> in every thing he does, his <hi>Ignorance</hi> makes him <hi>Daring,</hi> and he always ventures to Promiſe <hi>Infallible ſucceſs,</hi> from the <hi>niceſt, moſt uncertain,</hi> and moſt <hi>Deſperate Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> that are known in <hi>Nature,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by <hi>Art.</hi> If it were poſſible for him to give <hi>Fire</hi> in all its <hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Flames,</hi> you may be ſure he would not boggle at it. The more <hi>Suſpitious</hi> a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine</hi> is to a <hi>Prudent Conſiderate</hi> man, the more <hi>Bold</hi> he is in the uſe of it; as if he had a <hi>Priviledge</hi> to do what he liſts, in no leſs a matter than <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> from his <hi>Empirical</hi> qualification of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Impudence</hi> inſeparably mixed together. He never exhibits a <hi>Vomit</hi> with leſs than <hi>Mercurius vitae, Turbith Mineral,</hi> or ſome ſubtile Preparation of <hi>Antimony;</hi> his <hi>Purge</hi> never fails to be deleterious, or <hi>Mercurial;</hi> and as thoſe men do <hi>often</hi> the utmoſt miſchief by ſuch <hi>Violent Preparations,</hi> ſo they <hi>ſometimes</hi> happen to do marvels, which an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding man <hi>cannot,</hi> becauſe he <hi>dares</hi> not <hi>ſafely</hi> venture.

a <hi>Haemorrhage,</hi> as immediatly <hi>Cured</hi> him of his <hi>Madneſs;</hi> and of another, who <hi>Stabbing</hi> a <hi>Daggar</hi> into his <hi>Breaſt,</hi> in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, <hi>Cured</hi> himſelf of an <hi>Impoſtume;</hi> and yet if others ſhould venture to try the ſame <hi>Experiments,</hi> I would not Promiſe them a <hi>bare Poſſibility</hi> of the like ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>An <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlicenſed Practitioner</hi> in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> in this <hi>Town,</hi> was once ſo free as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me, as an ineſtimable <hi>Secret</hi> too, that he uſed for a <hi>Remedy</hi> in the <hi>Worms,</hi> a <hi>Solution</hi> of a ſmall quantity of <hi>Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Corroſive</hi> its ſelf in <hi>Water,</hi> and he ſeemed <hi>Tranſported</hi> with delight at the very mention of ſo notable a <hi>Remedy. Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> its <hi>Younger Brother,</hi> by three or four <hi>Sublimations,</hi> was deſpiſed by him as nothing. And <hi>Wormſeed, Aloes, Burnt Hartſhorn, Savine, Corallina,</hi> &amp;c. were fit to be Laught at as <hi>Childrens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,</hi> not <hi>his. Sublimate Corroſive</hi> was his <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and he could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſs the good he had obſerved from it. I could not but be very <hi>Serious,</hi> at the hearing ſuch a Relation, and it affected me with <hi>Pathetical</hi> thoughts, that the <hi>Common Civility</hi> of <hi>Converſation</hi> made me forbear at that time to urge. For it is a moſt <hi>Sad</hi> and bewailing <hi>Reflection,</hi> that the <hi>Rankeſt Poiſons</hi> in the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52455:52"/>
a mask, ſhould be given inwardly to Innocent <hi>Children,</hi> whoſe tender condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can hardly bear the moſt Mild, and Gentle things of all, without a great deal of ſtrugling.</p>
               <p>But to return, <hi>Fire</hi> as bad as it may prove, is the <hi>Deity</hi> of Beſotted <hi>Chymiſts.</hi> They can hardly allow a good Word to any kind of <hi>Remedy,</hi> that has not paſt through the <hi>Fiery Tryal.</hi> And perhaps it may be a main, though an unperceivable reaſon, why they ſo much admire all <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick Preparations</hi> above others, becauſe they do undergo the greateſt degree of <hi>Fire.</hi> I am no enemy to <hi>Fire</hi> any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as it is an enemy to us. The <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> has ſo ordered the whole frame of this World, in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that I know of, that upon ſerious conſideration every individual thing in nature will be found exceeding <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful,</hi> in ſome reſpect or other, either to the whole in general, or ſome remarkable part of it. <hi>Fire</hi> it ſelf, that is ſo <hi>terrible</hi> an <hi>Element,</hi> when exceeding its due bounds, when it is our <hi>Maſter,</hi> and not our <hi>Servant,</hi> is otherwiſe of as great uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to mankind, as any one thing that can be named. And a <hi>Moderate</hi> Fire will as much help to <hi>improve</hi> Remedies, as an

                  <hi>exceſſive</hi> one will ſerve to <hi>deſtroy</hi> them. When it is managed as it ought to be, it <hi>opens</hi> bodies, <hi>unlocks</hi> their <hi>faculties,</hi> and is a very great <hi>Aſſiſtant</hi> to <hi>Art</hi> in the right <hi>Preparation</hi> of divers <hi>Medicines;</hi> but if it be driven to <hi>Extreams,</hi> and <hi>Artificially Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberated</hi> upon <hi>Remedies</hi> with the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of heat that can be contrived, it ſhall entirely deſtroy the <hi>Radical</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> virtues of mix'd bodies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thoſe that <hi>Nature</hi> ingrafted in them, ſhall <hi>Create New</hi> ones, which whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be upon ſecond thoughts of greater ſervice to the World, than what an <hi>Infinite Wiſdom</hi> did, or was able to effect, I cannot but <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> doubt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Reverberatory Fire</hi> is beſt conſidered in a <hi>Laboratory;</hi> there you may ſee the <hi>Retort,</hi> which contains the <hi>Ingredients</hi> to be <hi>Diſtilled,</hi> placed in the midſt of the moſt <hi>Violent Fire,</hi> that <hi>Chymical Art</hi> and <hi>Invention</hi> could tell how to contrive. For many hours, and days together the ſtrongeſt force of <hi>Fire</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented, the <hi>Retort</hi> and the <hi>Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients</hi> in it are all the while converted into as <hi>true</hi> a <hi>Fire,</hi> as the <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Coals</hi> themſelves, only upon looking into the <hi>Furnace,</hi> you will ſee the <hi>Coals</hi> in form of <hi>burning Coals,</hi> and the <hi>Retort</hi> in form of a <hi>burning Retort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:52455:53"/>Now there are but very few things in nature, which can endure ſuch <hi>violent burnings,</hi> without conſiderable <hi>alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> if not <hi>Tranſmutations</hi> into other kinds. There may be one Metal, <hi>Gold,</hi> and one Stone, the <hi>Asbeſtos,</hi> or <hi>Amian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> which will not <hi>Conſume</hi> from what it was, or yield out <hi>Chymical Principles,</hi> by this continuance of the greateſt Fire; but moſt of the others will yield out <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Oyls,</hi> or <hi>Salts,</hi> which prove like <hi>Swords</hi> or <hi>Daggers, Fatal</hi> in the hands of <hi>Children</hi> or <hi>Fools,</hi> and ought to be uſed by the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> men with great <hi>caution,</hi> and <hi>circumſpection.</hi> Thoſe vehement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> have gained either <hi>Reputation</hi> or <hi>Contempt,</hi> according as the <hi>Brains</hi> of men have been either <hi>hotter</hi> or <hi>cooler.</hi> But in this laſt Age, the Bellows have been blown with fuller ſtrength than ordinary, and <hi>Furnaces</hi> have become <hi>Schools,</hi> wherein ſome men of Parts and Underſtanding, as well as hot-ſpurs and flaſhes, have pleaſed to ſpend the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt portion of their time, expecting by force of <hi>Art</hi> to bring <hi>Nature</hi> to what they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>And yet the <hi>Paracelſian Phaenix,</hi> which liv'd in the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> and in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> whither abundance of

                  <hi>Alchymiſts</hi> have <hi>Travelled,</hi> is dead or wholly loſt to Inquiſitive <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> The moſt zealous <hi>Chymiſts</hi> can only talk and write <hi>Miracles,</hi> but not perform them cleaverly; the moſt Famed <hi>Preparations,</hi> which the Authors have beſtowed large <hi>Panegyricks</hi> upon, and with a moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory aſſurance have repreſented as <hi>Infallible Catholicons,</hi> do upon trial in Faithful or Skilfull hands not anſwer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, or make good the Promiſes concerning them.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Diſtillation</hi> in a <hi>Reverbatory,</hi> it is found chiefly to produce, either <hi>Acid Corroſive Spirits,</hi> or Burning <hi>Empyreuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Oyls.</hi> The <hi>Acid Spirits,</hi> which can ſo powerfully <hi>Corrode,</hi> and <hi>Diſſolve</hi> the ſtrongeſt <hi>Metalls,</hi> that they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into a clear Liquor, will upon calm reflection to a conſidering man appear too too capable of deſtroying the Tender Principles of Life. And however they may be uſeful upon ſome very great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and therefore ought not to be wholly Baniſhed out of <hi>Apothecaries</hi> Shops, yet in ordinary or common caſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are now apt to be uſed much oftner than is really neceſſary, I ſhould think it the <hi>duty</hi> both of a <hi>Good Man,</hi> and an <hi>Honeſt Phyſician,</hi> to be exceeding Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52455:54"/>
in the liberal uſe of theſe <hi>Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> as they ought moſt certainly to be in all other things, which may in much Probability be of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>Indeed for a ſmall time <hi>Acid Spirits,</hi> (where <hi>Acids</hi> are requiſite, or properly Indicated) will give a ſtrange check to the violence of ſome Diſeaſes; but continue their uſe a little longer than is fitting, and the <hi>Stomach,</hi> or ſome <hi>Principal Part,</hi> or the <hi>whole Body</hi> in general will remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuffer in ſome reſpect or other. I ſhall inſtance particularly in <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Libello de Thermis Hirsber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſ.</note> which <hi>Gaſpar Hoffman</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to have rendred divers of his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents <hi>Cachectick,</hi> and very infirm, upon the continuance of it, though at firſt they did ſeem to receive ſenſible Benefit, from its ſtrengthning the <hi>Stomach,</hi> creating an <hi>Appetite,</hi> and allaying the <hi>Defluxions;</hi> and upon the grounds of his Particular Experience, he thinks fit to diſſwade people from being too Bold with this <hi>Acid Spirit,</hi> or from uſing it too long, leaſt it ſhould be found at laſt to deſtroy the Natural Heat, which is neceſſary for <hi>Concoction;</hi> and leaſt it ſhould bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences to the Body, which are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be lamented, than afterwards
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52455:54"/>
The ſame <hi>Author</hi> in another place aſſerts, <hi>That he ſaw ſome men, who upon an unadviſed long uſe of this Corroſive Spirit did at laſt</hi> (ſeem to) <hi>Vomit up part of their Lungs all Corroded and coloured like unto Vitriol; that he ſaw one whoſe Liver ſeemed to come up in Bits; that divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons juſt before their Deaths did grievouſly bewail their Error in accuſtoming their Bodies to this Spirit, and that they felt their inward Parts all Burnt and Corroded, and did ſuffer intolerable pains thereby. Particularly he mentions a famous Limner, who would needs try an Experiment, and Cure himſelf of the Gout, by the uſe of the Oyl of Vitriol, but who inſtead of that had deſtroyed his Vitals, and a little before his Death complained of Pungent Pains, like the pricking of Needles all over his body.</hi> And hence you may ſee, that ſuch Keen Spirits are not be play'd with upon every ſlight occaſion, and when they may, or are to be uſed, they muſt not be inſiſted on too peremptorily or over-long. It will not be amiſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member again and again, that <hi>Medicines</hi> which owe their exiſtence to a ſtrong <hi>Reverberatory Fire,</hi> are rather to be touch'd, than dwelt upon; and I do not doubt, but it were much better for the World, if Phyſicians had known nothing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52455:55"/>
at all of thoſe <hi>Great Chymical Preparations,</hi> than for them to be ſo fondly in love with them, as never to part with'em out of their thoughts, or to be uſing them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear or wit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acid Spirits</hi> may indeed be <hi>Dulcified</hi> with <hi>Rectified Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> whether by a <hi>Digeſtive Circulation,</hi> or by a New <hi>Diſtillation</hi> in <hi>Sand,</hi> it matters not much. And when they are ſo <hi>Dulcified,</hi> they loſe great part of their Sting, and are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs far better, and more Innocent as to Uſe, then with their <hi>Corroſion</hi> entire. So that Prudent men, who are concern'd in earneſt about the good or ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of their <hi>Remedies,</hi> do now oftner adviſe the <hi>Acid Spirits Dulcified,</hi> of <hi>Salt, Vitriol, Niter,</hi> &amp;c. than they will the ſimple <hi>Acids,</hi> in their full ſtrength and power. Beſides, not only the effects are ſafer from the <hi>Dulcified Spirits,</hi> but the <hi>Doſe</hi> may be that way conſiderably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and hereby we receive the good of <hi>Acids</hi> without the miſchiefs, and they are more adapted to the Tender Principles of Man.</p>
               <p>The Nature of <hi>Diſtilled Chymical Oyls</hi> may be a little gueſs'd at by the very <hi>Doſe</hi> they are given in. Two or three drops at a time are generally thought to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52455:55"/>
be very fair, whither becauſe they are loaded with more <hi>Fire</hi> than the <hi>Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and are therefore the more <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> or elſe becauſe of their ſluggiſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and ſo Heating the Part the more vehemently; <hi>Oyls</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſo nimble as <hi>Spirits</hi> in diſperſing themſelves, but the Effects of <hi>Oyls</hi> are the more durable. 'Tis certain that theſe <hi>Oyls</hi> are very <hi>Empyreumatical,</hi> and plainly enough diſcover, how nearly they are related to the <hi>Fire</hi> that brought them forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liquors</hi> which are impregnated with great ſtore of <hi>Chymical Oyls,</hi> are much more dangerous to accuſtom the Body to, than ſuch as are more <hi>Spirituous.</hi> For example, the daily loading the <hi>Stomach</hi> with <hi>Sack</hi> will prove much ſooner Fatal, then a longer and larger uſe of <hi>French-Wines. Sack</hi> is known to yield abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Oyl,</hi> and but little <hi>Spirit,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>French-Wines</hi> yield a great many <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and little or no <hi>Oyl.</hi> And hence our great <hi>Sack-Drinkers</hi> do ſeldom hold out long, for the <hi>Warm Oyl</hi> continuing ſome time upon their <hi>Stomachs,</hi> the <hi>Praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Heat</hi> does by degrees <hi>Burn,</hi> and prey upon their <hi>Vitals;</hi> whereas the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> in <hi>French-Wines</hi> do paſs off nimbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52455:56"/>
the Blood, and a good part of thoſe <hi>Wines</hi> is ſoon evacuated by the way of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> the burning force of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being in a ſhort time equally diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted through the whole body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the leſs pernicious.</p>
               <p>To give an inſtance in proof of my aſſertion, I ſhall here offer a very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſage that has hapned in my Practice. A <hi>Gentleman</hi> of about 36 years of Age had by degrees reduced his body to an inſenſible neceſſity of Drinking <hi>Sack</hi> for his conſtant daily Liquor. He was a Dead man, if he had not his Draughts of <hi>Sack</hi> ſeveral times every day. Nothing elſe at laſt could ſo much as <hi>Warm</hi> his craving <hi>Stomach,</hi> inſomuch that he quickly brought himſelf into an Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable <hi>Conſumption.</hi> After he had taken his Bed for good and all, he ſent for me, who ſoon acquainted his Friends, that it was too late for <hi>Phyſick</hi> to do him any good. And when he was Dead, they deſired me to <hi>Open</hi> his <hi>Body,</hi> and ſee what his Intemperance in <hi>Sack</hi> had there produced. And I found his <hi>Liver</hi> ſo throughly <hi>Boiled</hi> with the Conſtant Heat, that a <hi>Sound Liver</hi> could not well be more <hi>Boiled</hi> over the <hi>Fire,</hi> than his was by his uſe of <hi>Sack.</hi> It was in Colour
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52455:56"/>
and Brittleneſs the very ſame as a long-boiled <hi>Liver</hi> can be. And though <hi>Diet</hi> can qualifie the Heat of a Living <hi>Liver;</hi> yet I am ſure no <hi>Art</hi> can <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nboil</hi> it again, any more than <hi>make</hi> a <hi>new</hi> one.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs I would not wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the uſe of <hi>Chymical Oyls,</hi> as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Unſafe in reſpect of inward uſe. The <hi>Eleoſacchara Cinnam. Saſſafr. Citr. Mac. Faenicul.</hi> &amp;c. are not only pleaſant and agreeable to the <hi>Palate,</hi> but both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and beneficial to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and in Delicate natures will be admitted kindly, where other Remedies breed an averſion. And I take that <hi>Form</hi> of giving <hi>Diſtilled Oyls</hi> to be one of the beſt that can be thought of; for the Particles of <hi>Oyl</hi> are excellently well ſeparated by the quantity of <hi>Sugar,</hi> an <hi>Ounce</hi> of <hi>Sugar</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to a <hi>Scruple</hi> of <hi>Diſtilled Oyl;</hi> ſo that hereby the exception on account of <hi>Fire</hi> is avoided, and their good ſafely and pleaſantly in a proper Liquor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Fire</hi> can really make a more than ordinary <hi>Impreſſion</hi> upon <hi>Remedies,</hi> and that in <hi>Diſtillation</hi> even their <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> can be increaſed by admiſſion of <hi>Fiery</hi> parts, may be ſeen in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to <hi>Monſieur Lemery</hi>'s <hi>Courſe of Chymiſtry,</hi>

Book wherein <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> is diſcourſed of without <hi>Vanity, Obſcurity,</hi> or <hi>Affectation,</hi> and I think I may ſay, a <hi>Chymical Book,</hi> that has never yet had its Fellow, for an unprejudiced account, both of <hi>Chymical Remedies,</hi> and <hi>Chymical Notions</hi> too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Volatile Spirits</hi> are or may beſt be drawn in a more <hi>Mild</hi> and <hi>Natural Heat,</hi> than that of the <hi>Reverberatory.</hi> The <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, Hartshorn, Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>Bleſſings</hi> indeed, which we owe to <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> and are of excellent uſe, where the <hi>Spirits</hi> are ſpent or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed, or where the Blood is Soured by <hi>Acids,</hi> and in divers ſorts of <hi>Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> They come the neareſt of any thing to our Conception of the Animal Spirits, the Principle of Motion and Senſation, and being of ſo exceeding fine and ſubtile a texture, that their Impreſſion is wont to be communicated, as ſwift as Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from the <hi>Nervous Coat</hi> of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> to the <hi>Spirits</hi> diſperſed in the other <hi>Nerves</hi> of the body, as in <hi>Faintings</hi> and <hi>Swoundings</hi> is moſt <hi>ſenſibly</hi> perceived; without doubt theſe <hi>Volatile Spirits,</hi> ſo nearly related to the <hi>Animal,</hi> are the moſt proper Inſtruments in the World to reſtore and cheriſh the <hi>Animal,</hi> when either part of them are loſt, or all weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by too long duty.</p>

                  <hi>Volatile Salts</hi> are of the ſame nature with the <hi>Spirits;</hi> they are at firſt drawn confuſedly together, and afterwards ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by <hi>Rectification,</hi> or <hi>Sublimation.</hi> The <hi>Spirits</hi> are only a <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> diſſolv'd in <hi>Phlegm,</hi> and a throughly <hi>Rectified Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirit</hi> will not, or cannot diſſolve thoſe <hi>Salts,</hi> the <hi>Liquor</hi> muſt be <hi>Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> that is to receive them. They are both of an equal uſe, only they are a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to pleaſe the different palats of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and the different conceits of Artiſts.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Fixing</hi> a <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> or <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latilizing</hi> a <hi>Fix'd Salt,</hi> with which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits ſome Authors and Ingenious men have abundantly pleaſed themſelves, they will at laſt find that the <hi>Myſteries</hi> and <hi>Secrets</hi> have been far greater than the <hi>Effects,</hi> that the <hi>Mountains bring forth</hi> little more than <hi>a Mouſe,</hi> and that the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> after all is nothing elſe but a meer <hi>Incorporation</hi> of a <hi>Fix'd</hi> and <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> together. Two contrary qualities have remitted their Contrariety, and by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſent have met one another half way, and by the reſult of this Coalition do at laſt compoſe a kind of <hi>Mix'd Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,</hi> that is neither <hi>Truly Volatile,</hi> nor <hi>Truly Fix'd,</hi> but <hi>Hermaphroditical</hi> and Adiaphorous. So that if you have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52455:58"/>
for a <hi>Volatile Remedy,</hi> here is an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Volatile;</hi> and if you have occaſion for a <hi>Fix'd Remedy,</hi> here is an <hi>Imperfect Fix'd,</hi> and if the virtue of <hi>Preparation</hi> will make an <hi>Imperfect Medicine</hi> (<hi>Imperfect</hi> I ſay, in order to anſwer an Indication) more <hi>effectual</hi> than a <hi>Perfect,</hi> it may in time make a ſtronger degree of Fire to be not ſo Hot, or not to Burn ſo much, as a leſs Intenſe degree, nay it may in time do the moſt Abſurd, and moſt impoſſible things in nature. The <hi>Volatile</hi> and <hi>Fix'd</hi> qualities are perhaps to draw the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine into an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> one to draw it upwards, and t'other downwards, ſo that it ſhall neither riſe nor fall, but hang in the middle, as <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s <hi>Tomb</hi> is ſaid to do, between two <hi>Loadſtones.</hi> But it comes to be much the ſame thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we Heat a Cold Liquor, or Cool a Hot, 'twill either way become Tepid; whether we make an <hi>Acid Sweet,</hi> or a <hi>Sweet Acid,</hi> 'twill either way prove but Inſipid. What a vain, but loud noiſe have ſome made about Fixing <hi>Mercury</hi> into <hi>Lead,</hi> or <hi>Volatilizing Lead</hi> into <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury?</hi> The <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> has been a Jewel that hardly any thing leſs than the <hi>Philoſophers Stone</hi> could equal. And yet after all, we buy Wind and Smoak,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52455:58"/>
a <hi>Volatile</hi> will be a <hi>Volatile,</hi> whatſoever it is drawn from; and though there may be ſome Difference between <hi>Volatiles,</hi> as alſo between <hi>Fix't,</hi> yet it will prove to be but a ſmall Difference. They do both agree in helping to carry off ſerous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, where they abound, by way of <hi>Sweat;</hi> they do both agree in <hi>Sweetning</hi> the Humours of the Body, when they turn <hi>Acid;</hi> both the Spirit of <hi>Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi> which is a <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> and the <hi>Oyl,</hi> or <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> which is a <hi>Fix'd Salt,</hi> will ſerve to precipitate <hi>Fluid Acid Salts,</hi> either without the Body in Veſſels, or within the Body, by way of <hi>Sweat,</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> after due preparations firſt made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fix'd Alkali Salts</hi> are made by burning the <hi>Plants</hi> into <hi>Aſhes,</hi> or by <hi>Calcination,</hi> then making a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> which is to be <hi>Filtrated</hi> and <hi>Evaporated,</hi> 'till the <hi>Salt</hi> remains alone. They have a good uſe in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> on divers occaſions, as before, but being <hi>Creatures</hi> of the <hi>Fire,</hi> and having no exiſtence, as ſuch, in nature, until <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> have given them their Birth, as is at large proved by <hi>Monſieur Lemery</hi> in his foreſaid Book; a Prudent man ought always to remember their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and not to remain too long in the Continuation of them, no more than in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52455:59"/>
the uſe of <hi>Fix'd Acid Spirits,</hi> for the ſame reaſon: For as the <hi>Acid Spirits,</hi> if obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately urged, will <hi>Corrode</hi> and Burn the tender Principles of Life, ſo will the <hi>Fix'd Porons</hi> or <hi>Alkali Salts</hi> pall and weaken their Tone, if indiſcreetly or over-long continued.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>Natural Alkalis</hi> enough, which will very well ſerve to anſwer the <hi>Indication</hi> of <hi>Sweetning Acids,</hi> as there are alſo <hi>Natural Acids</hi> which will very well ſerve to repair the Laxneſs of the Blood, without an unneceſſary recourſe to thoſe <hi>Creatures</hi> of <hi>Fire, Artificial Alkalis,</hi> or <hi>Acids. Pearl, Oriental Bezoar, Crabs-eyes, Chalk, Corall,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>Alkalis</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not to be neglected or forgotten; and if we would ſometimes mend, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our hand, by giving a <hi>Drahm</hi> at a time, inſtead of a <hi>Scruple,</hi> or a few <hi>Grains,</hi> I dare be bold to ſay, we ſhould find the leſs need of <hi>Alkali Artificial Salts.</hi> And this may be a Rule of good uſe, not to be too Timorous in the uſe of Safe, Innocent, and Natural Remedies, as we cannot eaſily be Timorous enough in the uſe of Dangerous, Uncertain, or Great Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Preparations. Some have ſaid, and perhaps well too, that <hi>Poiſon</hi> is not <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in the hands of a good <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52455:59"/>
ſo <hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Fiery Medicines,</hi> may not be <hi>Fiery,</hi> or of a deſtructive nature, in the management of a Cautious, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding man. Yet ſtill <hi>Poiſon,</hi> though Corrected, or under-doſed, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by a <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> and by the beſt <hi>Phyſician</hi> in reality, will notwithſtanding all our Care and Cunning, be apt to exert its Primitive Radical faculties; and a good man ought always to remember the <hi>Eſſential</hi> qualifications of a thing in diſpute, or juſtly liable to ſome Suſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Too much <hi>Boldneſs</hi> in <hi>Suſpitious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi> and too much <hi>Timerouſneſs</hi> in thoſe that are by all granted to be <hi>Safe</hi> and Wholeſom, are equally <hi>Extreams,</hi> and deſerve to be blamed. <hi>Experience,</hi> the true Touchſtone of what is Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and what not, what is Safe, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, will at laſt reduce a Conſidering Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious man from either <hi>Extream</hi> into the <hi>Middle</hi> way, which <hi>inſtructs</hi> us to lay aſide that Paſſion and Prejudice by which men are apt to be led into Errors, and with an Impartial judgment, and mind grown ſteady in the Right, and Flexible from the Wrong, to weigh and determine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Excellencies of <hi>Natural,</hi> and the adventitious Imperfections of <hi>Artificial Remedies.</hi>

Stories of <hi>Mercury,</hi> yet not concluded to be an <hi>Eſſential Poiſon.</hi> A Caution in the uſe of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANd now I have thus ſpoken to the main Operation of <hi>Chymiſtry, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation,</hi> the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> Delight, and Theater, their chief <hi>Occupation</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> I ſhall immediately deſcend to ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, the Subjects of their uſual La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and conſider ſome of them as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially as I can, and with as much Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity as may be.</p>
               <p>The firſt that commonly recommends it ſelf to a <hi>Chymiſts</hi> Trial is <hi>Mercury,</hi> the <hi>Materia Prima</hi> of <hi>Metals,</hi> nay if you'l be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Adeptiſts,</hi> the <hi>Materia Prima</hi> of the very <hi>Philoſophers Stone.</hi> For though <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> are more <hi>Precious Metals,</hi> yet being very untoward as to <hi>Diſtillation,</hi> and yielding as good as no <hi>Chymical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Spirit, Salt,</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> they are made to truckle under <hi>Mercury;</hi> which pliant, tractable, but very uncertain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is capable of undergoing more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent diſguiſes, and receiving more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Forms, than any thing elſe excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Antimony,</hi> which two do in a manner equally divide the <hi>Regency</hi> of the <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdom,</hi> yet in Subordination to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52455:61"/>
their <hi>Solar King,</hi> to whom all the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers by Fire</hi> do pay their Hotteſt Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſubmit as to the <hi>End</hi> of all their Labours. They hope indeed at laſt to find <hi>Mountains</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> which the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Mercury</hi> is to lead them to, but as to their Operations upon <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> they can only <hi>Diſſolve</hi> them with <hi>Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Spirits,</hi> and then <hi>Precipitate</hi> them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Powders,</hi> of which how one will <hi>Thunder</hi> it, I have treated before. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> will find work enough for the moſt Curious, and Indefatigable Operator, it will yield divers ſorts of <hi>Precipitates,</hi> and <hi>Sublimations, Salts, Spirits, Sulphurs, Oyls, Liquors, Tinctures,</hi> &amp;c. which you may read, or ſatifie your Curioſity concerning, in <hi>Schroder,</hi> and divers other Authors.</p>
               <p>Now although <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Antimony,</hi> under the hands of Sober, and Expert <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> may be <hi>Prepared</hi> into <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> of Greater Uſe than ordinary, and therefore may not deſerve to be utterly <hi>Baniſhed</hi> from the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> yet being at beſt ſome of the moſt uncertain, ſtrongeſt, and moſt <hi>Dangerous</hi> Medicines that are to be invented, and this when <hi>Prepared</hi> the moſt <hi>Artificially</hi> and <hi>Care fully</hi> that may be, it were much to be wiſh'd, that no <hi>Preparation</hi> of them were
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52455:61"/>
to be Bought or Sold, but what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from perſons appointed to make them by <hi>Publick Authority,</hi> and that no <hi>Quacks,</hi> or <hi>Illegal</hi> Pretenders to <hi>Phyſick,</hi> ſhould be allowed at all to deal in them. If our hand or thoughts are never ſo little Careleſs, either in the <hi>Doſe,</hi> the <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> or the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of many of thoſe <hi>Medicines,</hi> the conſequence is no leſs than Certain Death, or the greateſt hazard imaginable. There is hardly a man alive, who is converſant at all in the World, in places where they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed, but he has met or heard of ſome lamentable inſtances of this nature, in Confirmation, and too true Teſtimony of what I ſay; inſomuch that I cannot but ſometimes wonder, that the <hi>Publick Authority</hi> does not think this a matter worthy their moſt Serious Conſideration, and that <hi>Apothecaries</hi> and <hi>Druggiſts</hi> are not as ſtrictly prohibited from Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or Selling <hi>Medicines</hi> of ſuch Nice and Dangerous conſequence, as they are or ought to be Cautious in the vending of downright <hi>Poiſons. Mercurius Dulcis</hi> is now as commonly Sold, as <hi>Rhubarb</hi> and <hi>Aloes,</hi> and yet we all know that <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Dulcis</hi> is a Preparation from <hi>Sublimate Corroſive;</hi> nay farther, that <hi>Sublimate
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52455:62"/>
Corroſive</hi> is often counterfeited with <hi>Arſenick,</hi> one of the rankeſt and moſt diſmal <hi>Poiſons</hi> that is to be met with. The way of knowing the <hi>true Sublimate</hi> from <hi>Arſenical</hi> is by rubbing a little of it with <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> for if it then proves <hi>Yellow,</hi> it is <hi>true Sublimate,</hi> if it proves <hi>Black,</hi> 'tis moſt Certainly an <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration</hi> with <hi>Arſenick.</hi> Now I am afraid, that all perſons who deal in <hi>Sublimate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive,</hi> in order to prepare <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> are not ſo throughly inſtructed in the way of diſtinguiſhing this <hi>Adulteration.</hi> So that if the <hi>ſweet Sublimate,</hi> happens to be prepared from foreſaid <hi>Arſenical Sublimate</hi> what a Pernicious and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Remedy muſt this be for ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Children, or others, to whom it is often adminiſtred for the <hi>Worms,</hi> and many other Diſtempers! But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Town ever now and then rings with an account of ſome ſtrange Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents from a ſingle <hi>Doſe</hi> of <hi>Mercurius Dulcis;</hi> they ſhall have the <hi>ſame</hi> Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as from <hi>Real Poiſons;</hi> and though the Diſpenſers of the <hi>Poiſon</hi> do always excuſe themſelves upon the account or a miſtake of the <hi>Corroſive</hi> for the <hi>ſweet Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimate,</hi> yet I am apt to impute it to that other miſtake of Preparing the <hi>Mercurius
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52455:62"/>
Dulcis</hi> from <hi>Arſenical,</hi> rather than <hi>True Sublimate.</hi> And now what a lamentable conſideration muſt it be, that the whole herd of <hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Empiricks</hi> do conſpire as one man to give ſome <hi>Preparation</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> in all their <hi>Pills</hi> that are expoſed to Sale! as if no <hi>Credit</hi> were to be got, no <hi>good</hi> to be performed, without throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Dye</hi> for <hi>All,</hi> without downright <hi>Killing</hi> or <hi>Curing</hi> upon a moſt uncertain, nay Dangerous Chance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argentum vivum,</hi> or <hi>Quickſilver</hi> is ſo called from its <hi>vivid</hi> motion, <hi>Quick</hi> in the old <hi>Saxon</hi> Language ſignifying <hi>Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and its <hi>Colour</hi> approaching to that of <hi>Silver. Scaliger</hi> calls it the <hi>Tyrant</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> as <hi>Gold</hi> is ſaid to be the Lawful <hi>King. Renodeus</hi> eſteems it to be the <hi>Monſter</hi> of Nature, as <hi>Fallopius</hi> does the <hi>Miracle.</hi> The <hi>Alchymiſts</hi> do call it the <hi>Sperma Metallorum,</hi> the Seed of Metals, the <hi>Seed</hi> from whoſe due Cultivation does ſpring that <hi>Bleſſed Stone,</hi> which is thought capable in convenient time of making an <hi>Adept</hi> as <hi>Rich</hi> as <hi>Midas:</hi> And hence in complement to their vain hopes they pleaſe to call it the <hi>Parent</hi> of all <hi>Wonders,</hi> as alſo <hi>Lac Virginis, Aqua vitae, Serpens ſemetipſum gravidans, Cervus Fugiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi> &amp;c. Laſtly it is called <hi>Mercury,</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:52455:63"/>
from its <hi>Mercurial</hi> qualifications, being ſo active, unconſtant, uncertain, and often <hi>miſchievous</hi> in its Operation. <hi>Lyars, Thieves,</hi> and <hi>Cheats,</hi> are ſignified by the <hi>Caeleſtial Mercury;</hi> and every man of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Experience is by this time too well ſatisfied, that not only <hi>Pſeudo-Chymiſts,</hi> but even the moſt Celebrated <hi>Chymical Authors</hi> do often deliver to us many palpable untruths in ſetting forth the Praiſes and Virtues of many <hi>Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Preparations;</hi> and the generality of <hi>Alchymiſts,</hi> if not the whole Tribe, after ſpending their Fortunes in vainly refining and <hi>Philoſophizing</hi> their <hi>Mercury,</hi> and in the moſt uncertain hopes of attaining <hi>Projection,</hi> do at laſt betake themſelves, by the ſtrong compulſion of an Abſolute <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> (whoſe <hi>Laws</hi> are commonly <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable</hi>) to the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Cheating</hi> and <hi>Counterfeiting,</hi> as thinking by that means in ſome meaſure to repair their Great and Certain <hi>Loſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not only <hi>Galen, Avicenna, Aetius,</hi> but moſt of our <hi>Modern Authors</hi> have eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Mercury</hi> to be a <hi>Poiſon,</hi> though indeed <hi>Galen</hi> does ingeniouſly declare,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>9.</hi> de Simpl. Med. fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</note> he never made trial of it either inwardly or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, whether it be effectually a <hi>Poiſon</hi> or not. Our later timer have been more
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52455:63"/>
competent Judges of that matter. For the <hi>Venerial Diſeaſe</hi> which was brought from far Countries among other Traffick about the year 1493. into <hi>Europe,</hi> has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned trials enough upon <hi>Mercury,</hi> whether it be a <hi>Poiſon</hi> or a <hi>Remedy.</hi> And happy it is for thoſe who have unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately fallen into that Foreign Diſeaſe, that <hi>Europe</hi> is ſo plentifully furniſhed with ſuch a <hi>Remedy</hi> as <hi>Mercury.</hi> I know that ſome perſons of note have pleaſed to maintain, that they have <hi>Cured</hi> a <hi>Radicated Pox</hi> without <hi>Mercury,</hi> and that <hi>Sarſapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla, Lignum Sanctum,</hi> &amp;c. have through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed the <hi>Cure</hi> in theſe Countries, as they do in <hi>Guiny,</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> but I am apt to think, upon the beſt inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I could make, that they are under a great <hi>Miſtake,</hi> or have been guilty of too much <hi>Vanity</hi> in that Pretenſion. A <hi>Pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Cure</hi> ſhall ſometimes in this Diſeaſe impoſe upon men of judgment inſtead of a <hi>True</hi> one; and it may ſometimes happen, that perſons who have been very <hi>

                  <hi>ANtimony</hi> is a Subject that has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed entire Diſcourſes, being that which produces a greater abundance of <hi>Chymical Remedies,</hi>

                  </note> and another may perhaps fancy at leaſt <hi>Six Thouſand. Paracelſus</hi> aſſerts its virtues <hi>to be inſcrutable, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; that the Archeus of the Earth could not beſtow more upon it, than it has; and that this is the only watry Mineral, which eſcaped the Deſtruction of the Floud, the vertues of all other Natural Bodies being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably impaired by that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Deluge.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding theſe flouriſhes of an admiring fancy, there were many Wiſe and Sober men, who thought it to be full as bad; as theſe could think it
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52455:72"/>
good. <hi>Fernelius, Riolanus, Geſner,</hi> and all the <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> rejected the uſe of <hi>Antimony</hi> with great paſſion and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Its <hi>Preparations</hi> were found to be ſuch <hi>Violent Emeticks,</hi> and <hi>Catharticks,</hi> that moſt <hi>Good</hi> men did think it better, both in Prudence and Honeſty, never to uſe them at all, than to experiment the effects of ſuch <hi>Medicines,</hi> as might likely enough through their great ſtrength and force have very <hi>Dangerous,</hi> if not <hi>Fatal</hi> conſequences. And <hi>Sayrus</hi> therefore urges its total omiſſion,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> clav. reg. cap. <hi>10</hi>
                  </note> as matter of <hi>Conſcience</hi> to his Readers; and that we ought not upon any account to uſe ſuch <hi>Vehement Medicines</hi> as are thence <hi>Prepared.</hi> And for this reaſon thoſe <hi>Worthy Phyſicians,</hi> who upon the firſt great noiſe and Fame of <hi>Antimonial</hi> and <hi>Mercurial Preparations,</hi> were Zealous Oppoſers of them, and would not have admitted them at all into Practice, if they could have help'd it, are not to be blamed ſo much as ſome will raſhly judge of them. They ſhewed themſelves rather <hi>Honeſt,</hi> than <hi>Moroſe,</hi> and no doubt they did their <hi>Duty</hi> at that time, in ſhewing the <hi>Rocks</hi> and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers that men were likely to ſplit upon. Can any man think it would have been proper for thoſe <hi>Phyſicians,</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:52455:73"/>
who were placed in the moſt conſpicuous Poſts, who were generally acknowledged by wiſe and impartial men to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the higheſt ſtation in <hi>Phyſick?</hi> would it have been proper for them to have ſate ſtill and quiet, folded their hands and only ſighed, when the firſt <hi>Violent Experiments</hi> were made on thoſe Subjects? No, it was time to Toll the Bell, when one Foot was in the Grave, when the ſtrongeſt <hi>Emeticks,</hi> and <hi>Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> were cryed up upon all occaſions. For thoſe firſt <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> who brought <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> into Play, were as abſolutely Oppoſite to all <hi>Galenical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> as the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> were againſt the <hi>Chymical.</hi> The <hi>Chymiſts</hi> fancied all the <hi>Remedies,</hi> which had ſerved the World before, to be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean</hi> and <hi>Impure,</hi> and 'till they had been <hi>Purified, Refined, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled, Separated</hi> from groſs parts, and the virtues ſome way or other <hi>Extracted,</hi> none of them were to be uſed. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the amazing effects of <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Preparations,</hi> that they did generally run into the moſt <hi>Vehement Emeticks,</hi> and that thoſe <hi>Emeticks</hi> were recommended on all occaſions, as if all former <hi>Remedies</hi> of that, or other kinds were dull, inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, unſavoury, and improper, we
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52455:73"/>
ought not to condemn too much thoſe <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Eminent</hi> men, who ſtoutly defended the <hi>Antient Phyſick,</hi> and Zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly oppoſed Innovations of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
               <p>It is not to be denyed, but that the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Phyſick</hi> is now very much beholding to the <hi>Preparations</hi> from <hi>Antimony</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi> I mean, while they are confined to the hands only of men of judgment and underſtanding. For as for the uſe which <hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Empiricks</hi> do make of them, it is too too certain, that under their hands they do far more Miſchief than Good. Nay farther, conſidering the frequent miſcarriages which commonly happen from an <hi>Empirical</hi> uſe of <hi>Antimony,</hi> it is no <hi>Paradox</hi> to maintain, that it had been much better for the World, if that <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> had ſtill remained within the Bowels of the Earth, and had never been fetch'd out of the Darkneſs it was born in, than to have given it ſo <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> and ſo <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream</hi> a place, not only in the <hi>Mineral,</hi> but the <hi>Phyſical Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs for the ſame reaſon that <hi>Extream Remedies</hi> are thought neceſſary to be uſed ſometimes, <hi>Metallick</hi> or <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Medicines</hi> may ſeem to claim juſtly a place in <hi>Phyſick. Hellebore, Coloquintida,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52455:74"/>
Elaterium, Scammony,</hi> &amp;c. are Purgatives of ſufficient ſtrength; and yet were known a long time before <hi>Mineral Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> came into requeſt; and where ſtrong <hi>Emeticks</hi> were requiſite, and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus</hi> and <hi>Aſarabacca</hi> were thought too Mild, the <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Fox-glove</hi> would anſwer the moſt violent <hi>Indication.</hi> Now there is a very great difference between the <hi>Vegetable,</hi> and the <hi>Mineral extream Remedies:</hi> Though they are both dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in their Nature, and may be alike miſchievouſly uſed, yet they are not both equally ſubject to do miſchief. For it is to be noted concerning <hi>Minerals,</hi> that both as they are in their <hi>Natural Impurities,</hi> and as they are <hi>Purified</hi> by <hi>Chymical Preparations,</hi> they do perpetually (ſome ſay) or a long time at leaſt communicate their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſuch Liquors as they are put into: as in the <hi>Crocus,</hi> and <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> in <hi>Quickſilver,</hi> and the <hi>Filings</hi> of <hi>Iron.</hi> Their virtue is not ſoon ſpent in <hi>Infuſion,</hi> but will with much the ſame, ſome ſay with the very ſame force im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate divers Liquors one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they did at firſt. And thus all <hi>Antimonial</hi> or <hi>Mercurial Emeticks,</hi> being received into the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and fixing their <hi>Mineral</hi> particles within the <hi>Plicae</hi> or folds
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52455:74"/>
of that Part, though by frequent irritations or provocations to Vomit they may ſeem to have ſpent great part of their force, yet they will for that reaſon a long time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their <hi>Spaſmodical Irritations,</hi> until <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> has loſt all her ſtrength, and therefore ends in a final ceſſation from Action, and the Light is extinguiſhed in irrecoverable Darkneſs. When the Body of a <hi>Mineral</hi> is throughly opened by <hi>Preparation,</hi> and the irritating <hi>Sulphurs</hi> let looſe, and urged to do their worſt, it will be harder then we are aware to Tame ſuch Powerful Enemies, and the skill of the greateſt Phyſician muſt be often forced to yield.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>Minerals</hi> are not eaſily tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into other kinds, nor can by <hi>Art</hi> be compelled to loſe their <hi>Primitive Nature,</hi> may be plainly enough perceived by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Microſcopes;</hi> for though the <hi>Precipitates</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the <hi>Sweet,</hi> and <hi>Corroſive Sublimate,</hi> do look more like fine <hi>Sugar</hi> than <hi>Quickſilver,</hi> and one would think the <hi>Acid Spirits</hi> had fairly divided the <hi>Mercurial</hi> parts, when they had quite diſappeared in a clear Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; yet upon view of thoſe <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> with <hi>Glaſſes,</hi> they plainly enough ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their <hi>Primitive Natural Form,</hi> and diſcover that all that the <hi>Preparation</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:52455:75"/>
could do, was to make them <hi>Dangerous Hypocrites.</hi> And beſides, how eaſie is it to reduce all the <hi>Preparations</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> into <hi>Quickſilver</hi> as at firſt, thoſe of <hi>Saturn</hi> into <hi>Lead</hi> again, and ſo of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and the reſt? There is great skill indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to deſtroy in them the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Revification,</hi> but very little Art will ſerve to <hi>Revive</hi> them.</p>
               <p>The bold and frequent uſe therefore of <hi>Mineral Medicines</hi> can never be too <hi>ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> conſidered and weighed. Even <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology</hi> might be excuſed on ſo important a ſubject. For things of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will not, cannot ſink equally deep into every mans head. One perhaps does regard but little what becomes of his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,</hi> all his thoughts may run along with his <hi>Profit</hi> or <hi>Ambition;</hi> another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves his judgment to ſuch <hi>Authors</hi> as agree beſt with his own Inclination, and this man can no more determine Truth in doubtful matters, than a man plunged in Love can give an impartial Character of his Miſtreſſes Beauty; a third perhaps has been bred up with ſtrong and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Prejudices</hi> under ſuch or ſuch a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and at a venture he is paſſionately and unreaſonably for or againſt <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> or for or againſt <hi>Method,</hi> as he has
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52455:75"/>
happened to be taught. But I dare be bold to ſay, that <hi>London</hi> is now as happy in ſincere, unprejudiced, and profoundly judicious perſons in the <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> as any one place now in <hi>Europe,</hi> and conſequently in the World. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though an <hi>Empiricks</hi> Skull be thick, and his temper moſt obſtinately perverſe, though you may ſooner knock out his Brains, than beat Reaſon into his Noddle, yet our <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Abilities</hi> are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally willing to receive a <hi>Rational</hi> hint, let it come from whence it will, whither from <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> or even from among our <hi>Selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But not to deviate too far: <hi>Crude An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> is ſo far from being <hi>Emetick, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick,</hi> or any ways <hi>deleterious,</hi> that both in <hi>Infuſion</hi> and <hi>Decoction</hi> it has hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any ſort of <hi>ſenſible</hi> operation. Some do eſteem it to be a <hi>Mild Diaphoretick,</hi> and others do conceive that it will ſerve to <hi>Sweeten</hi> the <hi>Bloud.</hi> It is probable enough, that it might make ſome good <hi>Alterations</hi> in bodies, if it were more frequently tried on ſome proper occaſions. But the numerous <hi>Preparations</hi> from it have very much prevented a right judgment of the effects of <hi>Crude Antimony,</hi> and where it has been tried, it has commonly been
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52455:76"/>
among a <hi>Rhapſody</hi> of other <hi>Ingredients,</hi> ſo that no Certain Determination has yet been made concerning the thing <hi>ſimply</hi> in it ſelf. Indeed ſome have magnified it as a very notable <hi>Arcanum</hi> in <hi>Venerial</hi> Caſes. But <hi>Mercury</hi> has been ſo great a ſharer with it in the Cures, that it is hard to diſtinguiſh truly how much, or rather how little it has contributed.</p>
               <p>I call it <hi>Crude,</hi> rather in compliance to the vulgar acception of it, or in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Preparations</hi> from it, than in regard of a ſuppoſed real <hi>Crudity.</hi> For the <hi>Antimony</hi> of the Shops, ſuch as only is uſed, is <hi>Melted</hi> down, and <hi>Separated</hi> from the <hi>Earth</hi> that is <hi>Naturally</hi> mix'd with it. A little of the <hi>Mineral Antimony</hi> may be ſometimes found at the <hi>Druggiſts,</hi> and ſeen for a Curioſity, as likewiſe the <hi>Mineral Cinnabar, Iron, Vitriol,</hi> &amp;c. But they do firſt generally undergo, a <hi>Fuſion, Sublimation, Decoction,</hi> or <hi>Cryſtallization,</hi> before they are conveyed about for uſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> is uſually the firſt tryal upon it, and from the <hi>Regulus</hi> Melted again, and caſt into Moulds, did proceed the <hi>Antimonial Cup</hi> ſo famous in former days, and the <hi>Perpetual Pill,</hi> ſo called becauſe it was a <hi>Medicine</hi> for <hi>Life;</hi> the <hi>Pill</hi> ſwallowed, and waſhed twenty
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52455:76"/>
ſeveral times, or as long as they pleaſed, was thought to loſe nothing of its <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> virtue: and ſo the <hi>Cup</hi> with a Glaſs of Wine fill'd into it for a few hours, was a ready and conſtant Vomit. But thoſe days are now pretty well over; it is now as rare to meet with the ſaid <hi>Cup,</hi> or <hi>Pill,</hi> as heretofore it was common. Whither the <hi>Regulus</hi> was thought at laſt not to be <hi>Pure</hi> enough, for a delicious <hi>Chymical</hi> Palate; or that it was not thought <hi>ſtrong</hi> enough, after the <hi>Glaſs,</hi> the <hi>Flowers,</hi> the <hi>Sulphur Auratum</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> &amp;c. came to be better known. However it took its turn, and gave way to the Next, according to the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> pleaſure.</p>
               <p>From the <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> or <hi>Liver</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> we have the <hi>Aqua Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta,</hi> or <hi>Vinum Benedictum,</hi> the <hi>Water,</hi> or rather <hi>Wine,</hi> which has been found to produce Happy and <hi>Bleſſed</hi> effects in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Stubborn and <hi>Chronical</hi> Diſtempers, eſpecially when managed with that Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Tenderneſs which Good <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians</hi> are wont to obſerve in the uſe of <hi>Remedies</hi> of this nature. The <hi>Ancient Phyſicians</hi> had their <hi>Hieras</hi> as well as our <hi>Modern Chymiſts;</hi> but thoſe of the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> if they contained any ſtronger <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> than ordinary, were <hi>Sanctified</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:52455:77"/>
with excellent <hi>Correctives, Cordials,</hi> and <hi>Aromaticks,</hi> which ſerved as much to keep up the <hi>Strength</hi> and Vigour of their <hi>Patients,</hi> as the <hi>Purgative</hi> was apt to <hi>Weaken</hi> them. Whereas thoſe <hi>Chymiſts</hi> who firſt <hi>Chriſtned Violent Emeticks</hi> with the Title of <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> and the like, did quite forget thoſe <hi>Cordial Correctives,</hi> which were heretofore thought neceſſary, in order to deſerve ſo <hi>Glorious</hi> a Name. Nor has our <hi>Diſpenſatory</hi> been wanting in this particular, in our <hi>Emetick Infuſion,</hi> called <hi>Vinum Benedictum.</hi>

                  <hi>Antimony.</hi> The two firſt, if careleſsly kept, grown a little ſtale, and ſuffered to partake of the <hi>Nitro-aerial Volatile Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> will be apt to turn <hi>Emetick</hi> inſtead of <hi>Diaphoretick,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Ceruſſe</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;</hi> and the <hi>Bezoar Mineral</hi> I have ſometimes known to turn <hi>Cathartick.</hi> For it is in a manner impoſſible to make a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> not to be a <hi>Mineral</hi> fundamentally, and to incapacitate it from returning into its <hi>Mineral</hi> nature. Nor is it a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,<note place="margin">Courſe of <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> in Remarks on <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt.</hi>
                  </note> what <hi>Monſieur Lemery</hi> aſſures us, that after he and <hi>Monſieur Seignette</hi> had Diſtilled <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> from <hi>Common Salt,</hi> he expoſed the matter remaining in the <hi>Retort</hi> after <hi>Diſtillation</hi> ſeveral times to the <hi>Air,</hi> and it re-impregnated with New <hi>Spirits,</hi> which were again Diſtilled off to half the quantity of the matter. And <hi>Seignette</hi> affirmed he had done it nine times one after another.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe <hi>Preparations</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which are only eſteemed <hi>Sudorifick,</hi> and perhaps are little elſe, if carefully <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,</hi> may doubtleſs be uſed with greater liberty than others. And <hi>Sennertus</hi> tells us of a Girl, that he knew of 12 years of Age, who being ſadly afflicted with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> all over her body, and eſpecially about the Joynts, he thought
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52455:78"/>
fit to order her 12 Grains of <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum</hi> to be taken almoſt every day for above a year together, and the Maid grew perfectly well again, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he had in vain tried divers other <hi>Remedies</hi> before. But a year was a great while, and the Maid but Young, and conſequently her Infirmity the leſs Incurable. However I ſhall leave the Story to others to muſe upon, and at leiſure to paſs their cenſures. The <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> being made of <hi>Crude Antimony</hi> and <hi>Niter,</hi> I take to conſiſt of more <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Principles,</hi> than the <hi>Bezoardick Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> productions from <hi>Butter</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> though that <hi>Bezoar</hi> (as 'tis called) be much recommended by Excellent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and particularly the Incomparable <hi>Riverius</hi> in many places of his <hi>Practice.</hi>

                  <hi>Vitriol</hi> is ſo called from its Tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, like unto <hi>Vitrum,</hi> Glaſs. There are ſeveral ſorts of it, but the <hi>White</hi> is by all eſteemed the Milder. And the <hi>White Crude,</hi> or as <hi>Crude</hi> as we have it from the <hi>Druggiſts,</hi> without any farther <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is a very Excellent, becauſe Mild and Safe <hi>Emetick. Phyſicians</hi> in general do rather chuſe to Preſcribe the <hi>Sal Vitrioli,</hi> and <hi>Vitriolum album Depuratum,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a better opinion of them upon the account of their being <hi>Preparations,</hi> and poſſibly ſome may quietly go along with the ſtream, without much reflection on the matter. But whenever they are <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,</hi> how properly and knowingly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they are rather a ſhot at random, as it happens, than any <hi>Certainty</hi> to the <hi>Preſcriber.</hi> For moſt of our <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> if not all, who diſpenſe theſe <hi>Medicines,</hi> are in a great <hi>Miſt,</hi> uncertainty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion about them. The Common, <hi>White Vitriol,</hi> as it is had from the <hi>Druggiſts,</hi> is accounted <hi>Crude,</hi> and therefore, as ſuch, is but little eſteemed for inward uſe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52455:81"/>
in reality, that, and all other <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triols</hi> are <hi>Depurated,</hi> before ever they are Bought and Sold. It is a very rare thing indeed to meet with the <hi>Native,</hi> really <hi>Crude Vitriol</hi> of any ſort; it is digged out of the <hi>Mines</hi> in a <hi>Vitriolick Earth,</hi> and ſometimes they meet with a <hi>Lump</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> even as <hi>Pure</hi> as they <hi>Prepare</hi> it, and when they do, they keep it by them for a <hi>Rarity</hi> to ſhew to Strangers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all our <hi>Vitriol</hi> is made by Artificial <hi>Solution, Coction, Filtration,</hi> and <hi>Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and conſequently it is <hi>Depurated</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have it, nor can we obtain any of the more <hi>Impure</hi> or <hi>Crude,</hi> unleſs we ſend on purpoſe for it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sal Vitrioli</hi> is made either from the remaining <hi>Colcothar,</hi> after <hi>Diſtillation,</hi> or elſe by <hi>Calcination</hi> of our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or the <hi>Hungarian Vitriol,</hi> in a <hi>Crucible,</hi> than <hi>Solution, Filtration, Evaporation,</hi> and <hi>Coagulation.</hi> And this ſame <hi>Salt</hi> is a ſtronger <hi>Emetick,</hi> than our <hi>Depura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or ſuppoſed <hi>Crudum.</hi> The <hi>Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum,</hi> which differs but a trifle from our foreſaid <hi>Crudum,</hi> and is a <hi>ſecond Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by <hi>Solution, Filtration,</hi> &amp;c. But by that ſecond <hi>Purification</hi> little more than <hi>actum ag itur,</hi> very little or no <hi>Earth</hi> is ſeparated;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52455:81"/>
this <hi>Depuratum Vitriolum album</hi> is that which is commonly Sold to <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> and by them Diſpenſed, through miſtake, for the <hi>Sal Vitrioli.</hi> The reaſon I have to think ſo, is this: I could name the place and <hi>Perſon,</hi> from whom a great many <hi>Apothecaries</hi> have bought up Pounds of the <hi>Depuratum</hi> for the <hi>Sal Vitrioli,</hi> and the Perſon who ſo vended it to them, did Confeſs it in my Ear. And beſides I have enquired at ſome Eminent <hi>Apothecaries</hi> for the <hi>Vitriolum Album Depuratum,</hi> and they have, not many years ſince, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged they never Sold any of it, but of the <hi>Sal Vitrioli</hi> they had enough. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if I had demanded the <hi>Salt,</hi> it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable enough they would readily have brought me the <hi>ſecond Depuratum.</hi> And this being the ſtate of our preſent Huddle about <hi>Vitriol,</hi> I hope it is not amiſs to ſhew whereabouts we are, and what an uncertainty thoſe are in, who Preſcribe theſe <hi>Preparations</hi> of <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore that I might be ſure what I do, and do no more than I willingly would, (for the <hi>Sal Vitrioli,</hi> and the <hi>Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum,</hi> do not ſo little differ in ſtrength as that it is not worth the while to mind it) I have a good while confined my ſelf to the <hi>Plain, Crudeſt</hi> we have, and among

us <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprepared Vitriol.</hi> For I would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be impoſed upon, with <hi>Calcined Salt</hi> for the <hi>Depurated Vitriol,</hi> nor willingly miſs my aim, if I had occaſion for a <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> as ſtrong as the <hi>Salt.</hi> The <hi>Vinum Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictum</hi> is ready, where we cannot be ſure of the <hi>Salt;</hi> and in Bodies or Diſeaſes, which do not require a <hi>ſtrong Vomit,</hi> the plain <hi>White Vitriol</hi> is a very good one, and I apt to think abundanly the better, for being one of the <hi>Mildeſt</hi> in nature, at leaſt of thoſe that are <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi> And it is not a little Material, that a <hi>Phyſician</hi> may manage <hi>Vitriolick Vomits,</hi> and eſpecially this laſt, even how he pleaſes himſelf; which is not ſo, of the ſtronger, thoſe that are <hi>Mercurial,</hi> or <hi>Antimonial.</hi> He will hardly loſe much time, if in tickliſh caſes he vouchſafes to ſtay with his Patient from the beginning to the end of its Operation. It may be urged with ſucceſſive Doſes, as he thinks it moſt convenient, or the Doſe or Doſes may be remitted, and the Operation made to deſiſt in good time. And <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits</hi> are a ſort of <hi>Remedy,</hi> which requires more than ordinary care and caution. They are ſo exceeding <hi>Good</hi> a <hi>Remedy,</hi> where they are proper, and do in many caſes ſo far excel the power of other <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:52455:82"/>
that it is a very happy thing to have ſuch <hi>Vomits</hi> in a readineſs, as where they are needful, we never need fear the conſequence of, and yet may reaſonably expect no ſmall Benefit from.</p>
               <p>And that the very <hi>Native Vitriol,</hi> with its ſuppoſed <hi>Natural Impurities,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Chymical Purification,</hi> or <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> is no <hi>Bad Medicine,</hi> we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably imagine, partly from the <hi>Mild Operation</hi> of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> that we have, and partly from thoſe Admirable effects that are known and granted to proceed from <hi>Vitriolick Mineral Waterss,</hi> adviſedly and properly taken. Thoſe waters which partake of <hi>Martial,</hi> or <hi>Vitriolick Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> are generally by <hi>Phyſicians</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended above all others. And hence our <hi>Tunbridge-Waters</hi> are come to be ſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. They are both of them very near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related, <hi>Iron</hi> conſiſting of a <hi>Vitriolick Salt</hi> among its other <hi>Principles,</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> being thought capable of turning <hi>Iron</hi> into <hi>Copper.</hi>

                  <hi>Sennertus</hi> maintains this laſt, with greater earneſtneſs than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; as that there are <hi>(Vitriolick) Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> in the Hill <hi>Carpathus</hi> near the Town <hi>Smolnitium</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> into which if you put a quaintity of <hi>Iron,</hi> it will ſoon turn into the <hi>Beſt Copper.</hi> Nay, that not only
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52455:83"/>
                  <hi>Natural</hi> but <hi>Artificial Waters</hi> will do it, and that if you put but <hi>Iron</hi> into a made <hi>Vitriolick</hi> Water, a <hi>Red Powder</hi> will be found in it, which being Melted proves to be <hi>Copper.</hi> To the truth of thoſe kind of Experiments I have ſpoken before, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. But as for the <hi>Mineral Waters</hi> which chiefly partake of <hi>Vitriolick,</hi> and <hi>Martial Principles,</hi> they are happily found to produce excellent effects in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſtubborn <hi>Chronical</hi> Diſtempers.

               <p>I have been at a <hi>Well</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where they confidently tell ſuch another Story, of a certain <hi>Governor</hi>'s Guarding it, and ſetting a <hi>Tribute</hi> on the <hi>Water,</hi> at ſo much a <hi>Gallon,</hi> that it immediatly dried up, and returned again upon a free paſſage.

               <p>And laſtly, for the Praiſe of <hi>Vitriol</hi> in its more <hi>Natural,</hi> or leſs <hi>Artificial</hi> ſhape, the <hi>Sympothetick Powder,</hi> ſo famous and ſeemingly Miraculous among ſome does deſerve to be remembred.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>CHalybeats</hi> are another of our <hi>ſix Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Remedies,</hi> and perhaps not inferior to the <hi>beſt Medicine</hi> we have in the <hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Chronical Diſtempers.</hi> A great part of lingring <hi>Chronical Diſeaſes</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to <hi>Scorbutick, Hypochondriacal,</hi> or <hi>Hyſterical Affections;</hi> many Diſeaſes <hi>in fieri,</hi> which are not yet perfectly formed in <hi>Regular, Diſtinctive,</hi> and <hi>Pathognomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Symptoms,</hi> are ſoon determined to be either <hi>Scurvy, Melancholy,</hi> or <hi>Vapours,</hi> and in thoſe caſes powerful <hi>Alteratives</hi> and <hi>Aperitives,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Chalybeats,</hi> are of no mean uſe.</p>
               <p>The plain <hi>Filings</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> powdered, or infuſed, though a much better <hi>Remedy</hi> than <hi>Steel,</hi> yet do uſually go under the denomination of <hi>Chalybeats,</hi> or <hi>Steel,</hi> theſe laſt being more <hi>Popular</hi> Names, both among the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and former <hi>Phyſicians. Steel</hi> is eſteemed to be more <hi>Purified</hi> than <hi>Iron,</hi> and indeed it is abundantly more <hi>Pure,</hi> as to <hi>Common <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes,</hi> but as for <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> it is more <hi>Refined</hi> than it ſhould be; for it is by <hi>Calcination</hi> diſpoſſeſt of great part of that <hi>Aperitive Salt,</hi> which we are ſo very much beholding

to for the powerful <hi>Opening</hi> of <hi>Obſtructions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Critical cognizance of its <hi>Chymical Principles,</hi> is of no great conſequence to the intrinſick efficacy of the <hi>Metal</hi> Simply in it ſelf. And therefore though <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Magnus, Schroder,</hi> and others, do think it to conſiſt of a more <hi>Impure Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> yet this ſuppoſed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Impurity</hi> is no good prejudice to the <hi>Phyſical Excellency</hi> of <hi>Iron.</hi> If it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of a <hi>Purer Mercury,</hi> it might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been much the <hi>worſe,</hi> becauſe more <hi>Dangerous</hi> as to uſe, with its more <hi>Mercurial</hi> qualifications. But if I may give my opinion in this matter, it ſeems to conſiſt of a <hi>Vitriolick Salt,</hi> and ſome <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> not ill <hi>Digeſted</hi> together.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>Impurities</hi> themſelves, or the very <hi>Faeces</hi> of <hi>Metals,</hi> are no ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible things, the admirable endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Litharge,</hi> and its temperate <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotick</hi> nature, may ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. Hence the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Nutritum,</hi> (and <hi>de Minio</hi>) the <hi>Emplaſtrum Diachylon Simplex</hi> (too much neglected, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten) the <hi>Empl. de Minio Comp.</hi> and the <hi>Diapalma,</hi> are much beholden to our <hi>Impure Litharge.</hi> And in inveterate <hi>

bought of thoſe accurſed <hi>Pſeudo-chymical Diſtillers</hi> at much the ſame price as <hi>Crude Tartar;</hi> there is hardly two pence a pound difference between them.

run the hazard of the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> good opinion, than let my <hi>Patient</hi> ſuffer a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect from <hi>Aſtringent, Aluminous Cryſtals,</hi> either through their Error, or my Inadvertency.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s foreſaid <hi>Preparation</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> or <hi>Steel,</hi> may with <hi>White-nine,</hi> or ſome Proper <hi>Diſtilled Water,</hi> and <hi>Sugar,</hi> be made into a <hi>Chalybeate Syrup;</hi> or with the <hi>Syrupus è</hi> 5. <hi>radic. aper.</hi> or <hi>Syrup. de abſyn.</hi> be made into <hi>Pills;</hi> or elſe given in <hi>Electuary,</hi> or <hi>Bolus;</hi> or with <hi>Roſe-water,</hi> and fine <hi>Sugar,</hi> adding a few drops of <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> be made into <hi>Lozenges;</hi> to be uſed, or continued, according to the judgment of the <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> after precedent Evacuations, and requiſite Preparations of the Body.</p>

about their <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> violent <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Head-achs,</hi> and divers <hi>Feaveriſh Symptoms.</hi> Whereas if their Ignorant Undertakers had <hi>Prepared</hi> the bodies of their Unfortunate Patients with ſome diſſolving <hi>Aperitives,</hi> and proper <hi>Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,</hi> thoſe miſerable <hi>Accidents</hi> would eaſily have been avoided.</p>
               <p>And it is to the terrible Conſequences of thoſe imprudent adminiſtrations of <hi>Chalybeats,</hi> that we muſt impute that violent and unreaſonable <hi>Prejudice</hi> which ſome People have taken againſt the trial of a <hi>Chalybeate Courſe.</hi> The very naming a <hi>Steel Courſe</hi> ſhall frighten a ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from doing <hi>any</hi> thing which might be for their good, and they will preſently think upon new meaſures in regard to <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and obſtinately neglect the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, if not the only means to do them good.

               <p>Next to the aforeſaid <hi>Preparation</hi> of <hi>Steel,</hi> which for its freedom from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

                  <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> and <hi>Hyſterical</hi> perſons, whoſe <hi>Bloud</hi> is too much <hi>Sowred</hi> already, and that makes it Stagnate in ſo many different places of the body, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently produce ſuch an <hi>Infinite</hi> variety of <hi>Symptoms,</hi> as often uſe to puzzle very Able <hi>Phyſicians</hi> in the true nature of the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> unleſs they pleaſe to Examine it with all their Wits about them.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Salt,</hi> or <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> is in far greater vogue among us, than ſuch Deſpicable, becauſe eaſie Medicines, as the <hi>Ruſt</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> powdered.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoing things again</hi> is avoided, which is laid to the charge of Purging.

And beſides, if Patients were apt to be Regular in their <hi>Diet,</hi> and took ſuch care as they ſhould do as to Heats and Colds, during the progreſs of their <hi>Steel Courſe,</hi> there might probably enough be the leſs need of <hi>Purging</hi> between whiles; but becauſe they are generally apt to be Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, and Careleſs of themſelves, it may in my opinion be more Proper, if not Neceſſary, to adminiſter a Purge in thoſe uſual intervals, ſo that <hi>Chalybeats</hi> be mixed with it.</p>

               <p>THE Famous <hi>Cortex,</hi> or <hi>American Bark,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Jeſuits Powder,</hi> becauſe ſome of their <hi>Society</hi> firſt introduc'd the uſe of it here in <hi>Europe,</hi> is now grown into that requeſt and reputation, that the ſuppoſed <hi>Phyſical</hi> Uſes of the <hi>Philoſophers Stone</hi> are hardly thought to be greater or more diffuſive, than ſome would have us believe concerning this plain Simple <hi>Bark.</hi> It is now the greateſt <hi>Catholicon,</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacea</hi> extant, and is accommodated to more variety of caſes, than the moſt <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoardick, Solar, Jovial,</hi> or any ways <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Rhodomontade.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:52455:99"/>That man muſt be very <hi>Ignorant</hi> in Modern Practice, or very <hi>Sowre</hi> in his Natural Temper, or muſt wiſh but little to the good of People, who will ſtill deny the <hi>Cortex</hi> to be a very <hi>Extraordinary Remedy,</hi> or would be willing to derogate from its <hi>Real Excellency.</hi> But it is, and ever has been, the Common <hi>Fate</hi> of all <hi>Great Medicines,</hi> to be lifted up for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time into greater heights of <hi>Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and to run into more <hi>

Excellency,</hi> and <hi>Admiration,</hi> according to the courſe and revolutions of things, lies Naturally <hi>one</hi> way, as their <hi>Wiſdom, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,</hi> and <hi>Admiration</hi> did lye <hi>another,</hi> and our Childrens Faculties will as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly lye ſome <hi>other. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi>'s <hi>Horn,</hi> the <hi>Oriental Bezoar,</hi> and other <hi>Pretious Stones,</hi> nay <hi>Betony</hi> among the <hi>Italians, Sage</hi> among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> particularly, <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Antimony</hi> among the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> many <hi>Preparations</hi> which lye ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in ours, or other <hi>Diſpenſatories,</hi> and divers <hi>Arcana</hi> of Eminent <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> have for a certain time made ſuch a Noiſe, that other <hi>Medicines</hi> could hardly be minded; and yet by degrees every one draws off into a lower Station, to give way for its next <hi>Succeſſor.</hi> At firſt when they appeared in their higheſt <hi>Exaltation</hi> and Splendor, the Eyes of men were apt to be Dazled, and they could not diſcover any faults; but when afterwards the Curtain was drawn, and they could and would leaſurely and attentively conſider the Object before them, the true Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were not ſo great, nor the ſuppoſed qualifications ſo conſpicuous as they at firſt imagined. Do'nt we diſcover <hi>Spots</hi> even in the <hi>Sun,</hi> by the late invention of <hi>Teleſcopes,</hi> and why ſhould we expect a

durable <hi>Perfection</hi> in any thing under the <hi>Sun?</hi> one man may indeed be much <hi>wiſer</hi> than another, but if we once come to make an <hi>Idol</hi> of him, or think him to be more <hi>Infallible</hi> than is conſiſtent with <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature,</hi> we ſhall be found at laſt effectually to depretiate him, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a lower eſteem of him, than perhaps he really deſerved.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cortex</hi> is now as much the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> as <hi>Gold</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Metals.</hi> And therefore a man had need have a more than ordinary care, what he ſays concerning his <hi>Prince;</hi> it is our <hi>Duty,</hi> as well as <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> rather to hide, and paſs by, than expoſe or magnifie his faults. Wherefore being conſcious to my ſelf of my own <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and <hi>Well-wiſhes</hi> to the <hi>Right Succeſſor</hi> in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> I ſhall be very tender of derogating from its <hi>real,</hi> and <hi>juſtly admirable</hi> properties, but muſt hope to be excuſed, where <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> is concerned, if with due <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> I ſpeak ſome <hi>Truths,</hi> which are of great conſequence to us when well known and conſidered.</p>
               <p>Divers excellent Diſcourſes have of late been publiſhed concerning the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi> ſome to explicate its nature, and others to inſtruct us in its uſe. And yet
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52455:100"/>
we are all of us ſtill in the <hi>Dark,</hi> more or leſs, as to a great many particulars about it; neither <hi>Honest Phyſicians,</hi> nor <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Patients,</hi> are ſo clearly enlightned, or fully ſatisfied in ſeveral circumſtances which do uſe to attend it, or in ſome caſes wherein it is now adminiſtred, as we might fairly deſire, or they ought in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to wiſh.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Quartans,</hi> and <hi>Autumnal Tertians,</hi> it is a <hi>Remedy</hi> of greater <hi>Certainty,</hi> and <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick</hi> propriety, than perhaps <hi>Phyſick</hi> was ever furniſhed with before, either upon thoſe, or any other accounts. Thoſe Tedious and moſt Obſtinate Diſeaſes were generally eſteemed to be <hi>Opprobriums,</hi> or juſt reproaches even to the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> and every humourſome cenſorious perſon, who had not <hi>Grace</hi> to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Mercies</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in providing ſo many <hi>Worthy</hi> men to be ready on the greateſt exigencies of humane Life to ſuccour and relieve them, who could willingly overlook all the <hi>other</hi> excellent and indiſputable <hi>Cures</hi> dayly performed by <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> would be ever now and then throwing this <hi>Dirt</hi> on the <hi>Faculty,</hi> that <hi>Phyſicians could not Cure an Ague.</hi> And yet this very <hi>Reproach,</hi> if well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, was an unworthy Taxation, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52455:101"/>
a moſt <hi>Notorious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth.</hi> For there were thouſands of inſtances, wherein <hi>Phyſicians</hi> did acquit themſelves with good ſucceſs, even in <hi>Autumnal Agues,</hi> before ever the <hi>Cortex</hi> was known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. And yet it muſt be granted, that there were many perſons, who mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably lingred a long time under <hi>Agues,</hi> notwithſtanding the endeavours of the beſt <hi>Phyſicians.</hi> But of them who were ſo Unhappy, it may be conſidered, how many were very <hi>Irregular</hi> in point of <hi>Diet,</hi> and the uſe of <hi>Medicines,</hi> what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair and diſingenious dealings <hi>Phyſicians</hi> do too too often privately meet with, from fantaſtical <hi>Nurſes,</hi> and conceited <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,</hi> who will needs mix, and often prefer their little skills, to very Rational and Adviſed Preſcriptions; how often thoſe <hi>Aſſiſtants,</hi> or other pretended Friends, have ſhamefully prevaricated with the <hi>Phyſician</hi> in their falſe accounts of many <hi>Medicines</hi> being duly taken, which were officiouſly conveyed out at the Window; and laſtly, how many giddy Patients have been ſoon tired with a <hi>Courſe</hi> of <hi>Phyſick</hi> in <hi>one</hi> week, which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably enough have had ſufficient effect, if they had but perſiſted a <hi>Month,</hi> or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:52455:101"/>Again, there were divers <hi>Febrifuges,</hi> which <hi>Sober Authors</hi> have delivered with great aſſurance, that have performed enough and enough to vindicate the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> our <hi>Art</hi> deſerves. I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but one, and that was <hi>Riverius</hi> his famous <hi>Febrifuge,</hi> which conſiſting of manifeſt <hi>Evacuations</hi> both upwards and downwards, and being therein diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to the <hi>Operation</hi> of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi> which is imperceptible and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in its operation, this was enough to ſilence that common <hi>Opprobrium</hi> of unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men, and to demonſtrate what the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> and a <hi>Skillful</hi> hand could do, when together joyned. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Agues</hi> in all <hi>Countries</hi> will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the very <hi>ſame Method</hi> of <hi>Cure,</hi> nor would the <hi>ſame Medicine</hi> be to all alike effectual, any more than the <hi>ſame Method,</hi> or <hi>Medicine</hi> can be eſteemed proper to all <hi>Countries</hi> in <hi>Continued Feavers.</hi> We may obſerve, that although <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and other excellent mens <hi>Works,</hi> be Studied, and taught in all places of the World, where <hi>Learning</hi> is eſteemed, although the <hi>ſame Principles</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> do every where prevail, yet every <hi>Country</hi> does very differently modifie and apply thoſe very <hi>ſame Principles</hi> to each places
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52455:102"/>
particular <hi>Temper.</hi> The <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Cure</hi> ſhall diverſifie, as the places differ, and in one and the ſame <hi>Country,</hi> according as the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Seaſon</hi> does alter; the nature of <hi>Epidemical Feavers</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily vary, and as the <hi>Feavers</hi> do alter, ſo muſt the <hi>Method</hi> alſo; which ſucceſſive alteration of <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and even of <hi>Agues</hi> as well as others, might very well occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a <hi>leſs Certain</hi> or <hi>Conſtant Cure</hi> of all ſorts of <hi>Feavers,</hi> until the <hi>New Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> were throughly underſtood.</p>
               <p>And yet although <hi>Phyſicians</hi> were ſaid to be ſo Unskillful, as not to be able to <hi>Cure</hi> a <hi>Quartan,</hi> before the arrival of the <hi>Cortex,</hi> all Illiterate and Ignorant people had abundance of <hi>Infallible Remedies;</hi> one would lay a <hi>Plaiſter</hi> to the <hi>Wriſts,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Feet,</hi> a third to the <hi>Belly</hi> or <hi>Stomach;</hi> one would have a <hi>Charm,</hi> or <hi>Amulet,</hi> and Others other ſort of Knick-knacks, all which would never fail to Cure <hi>Agues,</hi> if men had but <hi>Faith</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, the <hi>Mountains</hi> would then Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be removed; and thus every place was well provided with <hi>Inſurers,</hi> who could all Cure <hi>Agues,</hi> beſides the <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi> Only this was the difference; if a <hi>Womans Remedy</hi> did happen at any time to do it, or did <hi>appear</hi> at leaſt to do it,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52455:102"/>
then all mouths were open to <hi>Proclaim</hi> it, and the <hi>Country</hi> muſt preſently <hi>Ring</hi> of it from one end to the other, and for the preſent the Noiſe would prevail, and puff her a while up into <hi>Infallible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> 'till upon farther and frequent trials, her Courage comes to flag, her <hi>Remedy</hi> is known, or deſpiſed, and ſhe found at laſt to be no more than a <hi>Woman.</hi> But if an underſtanding <hi>Phyſician</hi> is called upon in the like caſe, either he performs the <hi>Cure</hi> with expedition, and then 'tis no more than another would have done as well, or it was but what ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a man of his Abilities; or if he miſſes the giving <hi>full</hi> ſatisfaction immediately, and the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward than to ſubmit to a <hi>few</hi> Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then preſently all <hi>Phyſicians</hi> are by general conſent condemned, and to their ſhame be it ſpoken aloud, <hi>not one can Cure an Ague.</hi>

               <p>But before I enter into that diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it may not be amiſs here to relate a very remarkable piece of <hi>Advice</hi> of our late <hi>Worthy Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Colledge,</hi> Sir <hi>John Micklethwait,</hi> to a <hi>Young Student</hi> in <hi>Phyſick.</hi> This <hi>Young</hi> man being recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him, Sir <hi>John</hi> ſoon gave him this <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>wholeſome advice,</hi> the effects of much <hi>Experience,</hi> and many <hi>Sober</hi> thoughts, to ſerve for a <hi>Foundation</hi> to his future <hi>Practice; that he ſhould always have a great care of Letting Bloud without good cauſe, and of being over-bold in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Opiats.</hi>

               <p>Wherefore becauſe a very <hi>Conſiderable Author</hi> has lately pleaſed to repreſent it as the <hi>Greateſt Cordial in nature,</hi> I ſhall more particularly conſider it in that <hi>Great</hi> reſpect.</p>
               <p>Our Famous Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> ſpeaking how <hi>Opium</hi> does uſe to affect the <hi>Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> when it cauſes <hi>Sleep,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pharmac. ration. Sect. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> ſays, that it does it, <hi>Non vapores in caput elevando, nec Cerebri poros, quò materies vaporoſa, aut aliàs ſoporifera admittatur, aperiendo; at ſolummodo ſpiritus quoſdam animales peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendo, ſive profligando, proptereà ut cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri, aut conſternati, aut interiùs compulſi, aut ſaltem ab effluxu in partes nerveas ſolito revocati, penſa ſua derelinquant aut ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quantiſper remittant.</hi> by killing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſome of the Animal Spirits, ſo that the reſt do either in a Conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fly, or are driven before it, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtrained from their uſual excurſions into the Nerves, do quite forſake their employment, or let it alone for ſome time.</p>
               <p>And I do not doubt, but a moderate doſe of <hi>Opium</hi> does as certainly <hi>kill ſome ſpirits,</hi> as a greater quantity will Kill them <hi>all,</hi> and lay their Maſter in an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable

And that therefore <hi>Opiats</hi> are far from being <hi>Cordials,</hi> muſt inevitably follow.

But even <hi>ill, faetid, and loathſom ſmells</hi> have a good uſe too ſometimes, not as <hi>Cordials</hi> to <hi>revive</hi> the <hi>Spirits</hi> (which is the intention of <hi>Cordials</hi> in <hi>Syncopes</hi>) but as inſtruments to repel their luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant motions, when they <hi>dilate</hi> too much, and threaten <hi>Suffocation</hi> through their immoderate <hi>expanſion,</hi> as is evident in <hi>Hyſterical</hi> caſes.</p>

               <p>I know that the <hi>Torrefaction</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> is now-a-days, much exploded, as being thought to deprive it of its <hi>Volatile</hi> parts, by reaſon of which it is ſaid chiefly, if not only to be <hi>Narcotick.</hi> But the exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the more <hi>faetid, Crude,</hi> and even more <hi>Narcotick,</hi> as well as <hi>Malignant Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> does not ſo mightily deprive it of its <hi>Somniferous</hi> quality, as to render it any ways inſignificant to anſwer thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications wherein it is required. If it be not ſo very <hi>Stupefactive</hi> as it was before, if it will not ſo ſuddenly aſcend up to the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52455:119"/>
                  <hi>Brain,</hi> and inviſcate the <hi>Spirits</hi> ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, it is ſo much the better for uſe, the more Dangerous parts being ſeparated, and thoſe that remain being ſufficient for our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Opiats</hi> are recommended in violent, and intolerable <hi>Pains;</hi> in exceſſive <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings,</hi> and <hi>Diarrhaea</hi>'s; and in great <hi>Diſorders</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits;</hi> and in thoſe three caſes there is no doubt but they ſometimes produce Extraordinary effects, and change the face of things, even in the midſt of Deſpair. In <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Diſeaſes, Extream Remedies</hi> are moſt properly <hi>Indicated,</hi> and ſo <hi>Opiats</hi> may and do upon ſuch <hi>Extremities</hi> prove ſtrangely Succeſsful. And it would be too partial, and diſingenious to deny them the good they ſometimes do in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</hi> But ſtill it muſt be remembred, that they are an <hi>Extream Remedy,</hi> and ought not to be uſed upon every ſlight account. It may be an <hi>Error</hi> of conſequence, either wholly to diſeſteem them, or to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie them too much. But this laſt will prove moſt <hi>Fatal,</hi> if all things be rightly conſidered.</p>
               <p>And I ſhould have urged the leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Danger</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> if the <hi>abuſe,</hi> or over-uſe of it were not of late years
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52455:119"/>
grown more prevailing, than ever was known before, or than is, I conceive, conſiſtent with the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Rational Cure</hi> of <hi>Diſeaſes. Opium</hi> has with ſome been made both the beginning and the ending, both the firſt and laſt thing in many caſes, nay as much a <hi>Catholicon</hi> with ſome men, as the <hi>Cortex</hi> has been with others. And thus they have for a time <hi>allayed Symptoms</hi> to admiration, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured a <hi>Calm</hi> before it was neceſſary, or truly expedient. But the Patient not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding remains crazy and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chectick, and it is ſeldom long but he <hi>relapſes</hi> into as bad, or <hi>worſe Symptoms</hi> than before. Where <hi>Proper Evacuations</hi> have not preceded, but immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe has been made to the <hi>Opium,</hi> as if nothing could be done without it, and that alone were able to do all things, I have known, and experienced, <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix ſtrong Doſes,</hi> one ſoon after another, ſignifie as good as nothing; whereas in the ſame Circumſtances, or upon the very ſame perſons, where <hi>Evacuations</hi> have led the way, <hi>one ſingle Doſe</hi> has attained the <hi>End</hi> deſigned.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Cholick Pains,</hi> in <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> and <hi>Hyſterical</hi> diſtempers, frequent repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of great quantities of <hi>Opium</hi> have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52455:120"/>
though with much ſtruggling and difficulty, at laſt conquered the moſt <hi>Violent Pains,</hi> and reduced the diſordered Spirits into <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Quietneſs;</hi> but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in reality the <hi>Enemy</hi> is only laid aſleep, or forced to give ſome reſpite, the Diſeaſe will ſoon again recollect its ſtrength, in the ſame, or ſome other manner. But in the <hi>Cholick,</hi> a moſt grievous and <hi>Epidemical</hi> diſtemper, I muſt affirm, that I have <hi>often</hi> Experienced a thouſand times more <hi>Succeſs</hi> from a <hi>plain</hi> but <hi>ſtrong Infuſion</hi> of Choice <hi>Rheubarb</hi> in <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> or <hi>Aniſeed Water,</hi> than from all the <hi>Opiats</hi> I ever had recourſe to. And this <hi>Medicine</hi> being ſo excellent an <gap reason="foreign">

You may <hi>Infuſe</hi> two, three, or four Ounces of Choice <hi>Rheubarb,</hi> a <hi>Remedy</hi> ſo Excellent in it ſelf, that it has deſerved the Name of <hi>Anima hepatis,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>Liver,</hi> you may <hi>Infuſe</hi> of it, more or leſs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

You may give five or ſix ſpoonfulls of it at a time, and repeat a ſecond Doſe an hour or two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt. In the more <hi>Melancholick,</hi> and <hi>Phlegmatick</hi> bodies, I commonly uſe the <hi>Infuſion</hi> of <hi>Rheubarb,</hi> and <hi>Gentian root</hi> together.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though it be <hi>but</hi> an <hi>Infuſion</hi> of ſome weeks, and a very <hi>plain</hi> one too, yet I dare recommend it over and over again, and I doubt not but the admirable <hi>Efficacy</hi> of the <hi>Medicine,</hi> will Apologize ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for its <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and want of <hi>ſhew.</hi> And that <hi>Chearfulneſs</hi> of <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> which does uſually attend a <hi>Cure</hi> by <hi>Proper Evacuations</hi> of the <hi>Turgid</hi> humours, is of no ſmall moment, if compared with that <hi>Heavineſs</hi> and <hi>Sottiſhneſs,</hi> that <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity</hi> and <hi>Diſorder</hi> in the <hi>Eye,</hi> which do ever follow a plentiful adminiſtration of that <hi>Soporiferous Juice.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As I am in my <hi>Natural Temper</hi> far from being ſubject to the over-admiring my ſelf, and my own ſlender performances, ſo I have no reaſon to Deſpair, but my <hi>hearty</hi> and <hi>earneſt deſire</hi> to be <hi>truly ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to <hi>Mankind</hi> in my <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> may be attended with the <hi>doing ſomething</hi> which I may <hi>Hope</hi> will not prove altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable, or <hi>to no purpoſe</hi> at all, even in the foreſaid <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi> And if I know my ſelf a little, I can farther declare, that the very <hi>Act</hi> it ſelf, of <hi>Doing</hi> ſome <hi>unexpected Good</hi> to thoſe who are afflicted with it, will be a greater <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> to my own mind, than any conſequential <hi>Profit, Honour,</hi> or other <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> It is very true, that the Providence, which governs the World, does not leave us ſo deſtitute in the Cure of Diſeaſes, as ſome mens fears may ſuggeſt. And if we would not haughtily overlook ſometimes <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>obvious Medicines,</hi> which are not leſs <hi>Excellent</hi> than <hi>Common,</hi> and would but expect leſs from the ingenuity and ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our own <hi>Preparations</hi> and beloved <hi>Contrivances,</hi> we ſhould much oftner than we do find <hi>Admirable Remedies</hi> ready pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for our uſe, which when rightly
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52455:131"/>
managed by an underſtanding man, would do <hi>wonders</hi> that are often vainly expected from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and remote parts.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not now deſign a full <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Gout,</hi> or enter deeply into the <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Cauſes, Signs,</hi> and <hi>Cure</hi> of this <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,</hi> but content my ſelf with making a few <hi>Tranſient Remarks,</hi> which are rather <hi>Practical</hi> than <hi>Notional,</hi> relating to it. And in the firſt place we ought diligently to diſtinguiſh, between the <hi>Gout,</hi> and a <hi>Fit</hi> of the <hi>Gout,</hi> as we do at other times between the <hi>Stone,</hi> and a <hi>Fit</hi> of the <hi>Stone.</hi> The <hi>Gout</hi> is an habitual, or long-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Diſpoſition of nature to throw off offenſive humours upon the Joynts, as often as upon any remarkable irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or a gradual collection of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as is like to prove injurious to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, or the Vitals, the Principal Parts are threatned with danger. The <hi>Fit</hi> is a ſubſequent act, or preſent diſcharge of the offenſive humours, upon either one, more, or even all the Joynts, according to their greater or leſſer weakneſs, or elſe the greatneſs of the Prepared Diſorder in the body. Now a man may have a <hi>Gouty Diſpoſition</hi> of body, even when he is quite free from any <hi>Actual Fit;</hi> and thus another may have a <hi>Stone</hi> lodging quietly
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52455:132"/>
in his <hi>Kidneys</hi> or <hi>Bladder,</hi> and may even then be properly ſaid to have the <hi>Stone,</hi> though he is not at all troubled with any ſenſible <hi>Fit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and the <hi>Cure</hi> of the <hi>Fit,</hi> are alſo two very different things, and ought in reaſon to be diverſly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged according to their different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. If therefore a <hi>Patient</hi> in a <hi>Fit</hi> of the <hi>Gout</hi> ſends for a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> he muſt <hi>then only</hi> expect to be <hi>Cured</hi> of his <hi>Fit;</hi> and if inſtead of a <hi>Fit</hi> that would accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the courſe of nature hold him <hi>ſix,</hi> or <hi>eight weeks</hi> in <hi>Pain,</hi> and <hi>weakneſs,</hi> he ſhall be relieved of his <hi>Pain</hi> in a <hi>few hours,</hi> and delivered of his <hi>weakneſs</hi> in a <hi>few days,</hi> he has reaſon to Thank <hi>God</hi> for this Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Art, and to embrace it with Joy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> thing therefore, and the <hi>chief</hi> that is to be done of the <hi>Fit,</hi> is to take away the <hi>Pain</hi> each part, where the <hi>Defluxion</hi> has fallen, by <hi>Proper Outward Applications,</hi> and to free the parts as well as may be from that <hi>load</hi> which <hi>within</hi> ſwells and dilates preternaturally the <hi>Nerves,</hi> and which frets and exagitates the <hi>Spirits</hi> there inhabiting. For although the <hi>Defluxion</hi> does at firſt appear <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and Inſenſible, yet in a little time it
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52455:132"/>
turns to be <hi>Humoural,</hi> and palpably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And a great many little diſputes about we know not what, and what we never can know, but only paſs a <hi>Learned Gueſs</hi> concerning, are no ways material to the <hi>True Cure</hi> of the <hi>Gout</hi> any ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. We are <hi>certain</hi> of a <hi>precedent diſorder</hi> in the <hi>body,</hi> we are <hi>certain</hi> of a <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Pain</hi> in the <hi>Joynts,</hi> and upon a <hi>Metaſtaſis,</hi> or tranſlation of the foreſaid diſorder from within the trunk of the body to the outward parts, we are <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> that the diſeaſed perſons do find themſelves much relieved within, and as much aggrieved in the outward parts. And the ſettling <hi>Notions</hi> nicely, whither it be a <hi>vapour,</hi> or <hi>humour, wind,</hi> or <hi>ſpirit,</hi> either or neither, which is the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> of the tranſlation from within out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warldly, would indeed make a divertive diſcourſe, but will be very inſignificant in reality to the laying a <hi>good Foundation</hi> for the <hi>Cure</hi> of this <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pain</hi> being often ſo great as to cauſe a <hi>Symptomatick Feaver</hi> with it, we ought diligently to apply our ſelves to remove this <hi>Grievous Pain,</hi> and a man may as well maintain, that it would be <hi>injurious</hi> to the <hi>body</hi> to part with a <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ague,</hi> before it has been ſhook with
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52455:133"/>
it for a <hi>full year,</hi> as that it would not be <hi>ſafe</hi> to loſe the <hi>Pain,</hi> before ſo many <hi>weeks</hi> are over, and <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf has as it were in Pity to the Diſeaſed at laſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them a convenient reſpite. The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Pain</hi> being <hi>Conjunct</hi> in the <hi>Part,</hi> or <hi>Parts affected,</hi> why may not the removal of the <hi>Conjunct,</hi> and even <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Cauſe,</hi> be a proper ſtroke to the <hi>Cure</hi> of the <hi>Pain,</hi> as well as the removal of the <hi>Antecedent Cauſe Prevent</hi> or <hi>Cure</hi> the <hi>Gout?</hi> the ſame Natural Principle, which threw the diſorder upon the <hi>Joynts,</hi> would doubtleſs, if it had been able, have throughly diſcharged it even from the <hi>Outworks</hi> of the body. Unleſs we will think, that it is <hi>delightful,</hi> and ſome ways convenient to <hi>Nature,</hi> to have an <hi>Enemy</hi> remain ſo near it, as the <hi>Hands,</hi> or <hi>Feet.</hi> Poſſibly it may, by way of a <hi>Spiritual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,</hi> and to help <hi>Contemplation;</hi> but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thinks himſelf altogether <hi>ſecure</hi> in the <hi>main Fort,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Enemy</hi> is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the <hi>Outworks,</hi> may be <hi>ſurprized</hi> before he's aware, and come to loſe Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the whole.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Benefit</hi> of <hi>Outward Applications,</hi> when properly and ſafety adminiſtred, in a raging <hi>Fit</hi> of the <hi>Gout,</hi> is a <hi>great,</hi> as the <hi>freedom</hi> from <hi>Pain</hi> in any <hi>other part</hi> is
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52455:133"/>
                  <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> in reſpect of <hi>that part.</hi> But the unhappineſs of them is, that they have been generally managed by <hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Ideots,</hi> rather than by <hi>Phyſicians;</hi> that divers inſtances are to be met with, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Outward Applications</hi> have proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, and have perhaps directly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Patient;</hi> but ſtill the irregular uſe of any ſort of <hi>Medicine,</hi> is no juſt exception to the thing it ſelf. For otherwiſe we muſt lay aſide <hi>Vomits,</hi> and <hi>Purges,</hi> and <hi>Opiats;</hi> nay we ought as well to abſtain front every ſort of <hi>Meat,</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> becauſe <hi>Gluttons</hi> and <hi>Sots</hi> have abuſed the uſe of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repellents</hi> and <hi>Narcoticks</hi> are favoured too much, as well by the generality of <hi>Authors,</hi> as by <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Empiricks.</hi> And though abundance of <hi>Formulae</hi> are deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Excellent</hi> men, in this <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> yet upon the <hi>Experience</hi> that I have had in it, I can hardly conceive any <hi>Arthritick</hi> caſe, which <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> or <hi>property</hi> requires them. Upon a conſiderable <hi>Declination</hi> of the <hi>Fit,</hi> they may happen to be uſed, when no <hi>great hurt</hi> may enſue, and ſome <hi>good</hi> may appear to follow, but the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous conſequences will even then be durable, and in time convince them of their <hi>Error.</hi> It may ſuffice to give one

               <p>But the uſe of <hi>Repellents</hi> and <hi>Aſtringen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topicks,</hi> is rather recommended by <hi>Authors</hi> in <hi>Hot,</hi> never in <hi>Cold Gouts,</hi> called <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi> from the viſible Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Parts</hi> affected, or elſe of the <hi>body</hi> in general.

The <hi>Vitals</hi> being <hi>Strong,</hi> and the <hi>Limbs</hi> being rendred <hi>Weak, Nature</hi> like a Skilful <hi>Phyſician,</hi> throws the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive humours from <hi>within</hi> (the place of moſt danger) to the <hi>Outward</hi> parts, where the danger is leſs; and thus thoſe parts are very ſubject to receive them, when men are Diſpoſed to this Diſeaſe. And for the ſame reaſon it comes to paſs,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52455:137"/>
that perſons who have any <hi>Natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> about them, whither it be in the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> the <hi>Glandules</hi> about their <hi>Throat,</hi> their <hi>Lungs,</hi> or in any other part, ſhall as <hi>Naturally</hi> receive into it the effects of any diſorder, either by <hi>Intemperance, Colds,</hi> or the like, as thoſe who have a <hi>weakneſs</hi> in the <hi>Joynts,</hi> do prove ſubject unto the <hi>Gout.</hi> Now the <hi>Parts</hi> being already <hi>weak,</hi> and the <hi>Joynts</hi> relaxed from their <hi>Primitive Tone,</hi> any <hi>Remedy</hi> which is of a <hi>Relaxing</hi> quality (as <hi>Oyls</hi> moſt plainly are) muſt of neceſſity do as much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, by its additional <hi>Relaxation,</hi> as the <hi>Ingredients</hi> joyned to it can be conceived to do <hi>good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Water,</hi> if the <hi>Baſis</hi> of it be a <hi>Water,</hi> it muſt needs be near as bad as the <hi>Oyl,</hi> being alſo of a ſoftning emollient nature, and thereby tending towards the farther <hi>Weakning</hi> of the already <hi>enfeebled Joynts.</hi> I know how famous the <hi>Aqua Antipodagrica Rulandi,</hi> deſcribed in that excellent Treatiſe of <hi>Loſelius de Podagrâ,</hi> and in his <hi>Secreta Spagyrica,</hi> Printed late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jenae;</hi> the <hi>Aqua Quercetani Antipoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grica,</hi> and others, have formerly been. But there's a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Waters</hi> of this, or any other kind, in the hands, and under the management
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52455:137"/>
of ſuch <hi>Able Phyſicians,</hi> and the <hi>Waters</hi> of a <hi>Woman,</hi> or an <hi>Ignorant Empirick,</hi> who know not how to ſuit them to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uſes, and who are continually ſubject to miſtake, both in the quantities and the qualities of the Ingredients, which enter into them. <hi>One Water</hi> can be no more proper for all ſorts of <hi>Gouts,</hi> than <hi>one Habit,</hi> and <hi>one kind</hi> of <hi>Diet,</hi> agree to all ſorts of men. For there is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable difference in <hi>Gouts,</hi> according to the different <hi>Complexions</hi> of men that are afflicted with it, according to the <hi>recency,</hi> or <hi>inveterateneſs</hi> of the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the continual <hi>variations</hi> of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in the ſame perſon, inſomuch that <hi>Good Authors</hi> have deſcribed a great many kinds of <hi>Medicines,</hi> both <hi>Outward,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> to be interchanged, and altered, according to Diſcretion, as they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be <hi>Juvantia,</hi> or <hi>Laedentia,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or diſagreeable, upon Particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Nay the <hi>ſame Remedy</hi> has been obſerved to have <hi>admirable effects</hi> at one time, and to be <hi>inſignificant</hi> at another, even in the <hi>ſame perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly as for the <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> I'le grant it may be an <hi>Excellent</hi> one, as there are <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulae</hi> enough of <hi>ſome few Good,</hi> and <hi>many more Bad,</hi> and that this <hi>Plaiſter</hi> may be
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52455:138"/>
ſometimes accommodated to very good purpoſe in one ſort of <hi>Gout;</hi> but when an <hi>Ideot</hi> comes to manage it, who can no more diſtinguiſh in reality between <hi>Gouts,</hi> than a <hi>Blind</hi> man between <hi>Colours,</hi> who uſes his <hi>Plaiſter</hi> at random, as a <hi>Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> throws the <hi>Dice,</hi> it muſt certainly <hi>happen</hi> to do as much <hi>hurt</hi> ſometimes, as it may happen to do <hi>good</hi> at others. And therefore what a Bleſſed condition muſt thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> be in, who in ſuch tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh points as neither themſelves, nor their <hi>Quacks</hi> can poſſibly underſtand, will run the hazard of a <hi>Plaiſters,</hi> doing either <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Hurt,</hi> as <hi>meer Chance</hi> directs it! I have often obſerved the very <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> though an <hi>Excellent</hi> ſort, the very <hi>Form,</hi> I ſay, of <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> notoriouſly to diſagree with this <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi> The <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Cataplaſm</hi> is much more likely to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer an intention <hi>throughly,</hi> and <hi>ſafely,</hi> than any other that I know of; it may be impregnated with <hi>proper Medicines</hi> more <hi>Strongly,</hi> or <hi>Mildly,</hi> as the <hi>Phyſician</hi> judges it moſt convenient, and as the Caſe appears before him.</p>

                  <hi>Bayrus</hi> gives us a very famous Hiſtory of himſelf, how by the uſe of his <hi>Caryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtinum,</hi> an <hi>Excellent Purging Electuary,</hi> when he was brought ſo low with the <hi>Gout,</hi> that he could move neither <hi>Hand</hi> nor <hi>Foot,</hi> nor <hi>any part</hi> of his whole <hi>body,</hi> beſides the <hi>Tongue,</hi> yet upon taking half an ounce of the ſaid <hi>Electuary,</hi> after it

               <p>But now as for <hi>Bayrus</hi> his caſe, there is no ſuch wonder that this <hi>Purge,</hi> or even a <hi>Purge</hi> in general ſhould prove ſo <hi>Safe</hi> to him at that time, or that he from thence ſhould take occaſion of urging the benefit of <hi>Purging</hi> at any time of the <hi>Fit.</hi> For he had no <hi>Acute Pains</hi> in <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two Parts</hi> more remarkably, but his <hi>Pain,</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe</hi> together, were in a manner <hi>equally</hi> diſperſed all over his body.

                  </gap>, as it would have done upon a leſs or another occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore it will not follow from this Famous Story, (what I aſſerted at
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52455:140"/>
firſt) that Purging about the Beginning, or in the heighth of the Fit (while the Pain is very Acute) is a ſafe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Method. But bring the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe into a <hi>Declination,</hi> that is truly, take away the <hi>Pain,</hi> let it be done in an <hi>hour</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> or in longer time, and there ought to be no farther diſpute, but <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Judicious Evacuations</hi> may be as <hi>Beneficial,</hi> as if the <hi>Declination</hi> had been tediouſly expected, for divers long weeks, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Courſe</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Bleeding,</hi> although in <hi>Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> perſons, who are more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily addicted, or accuſtomed to a <hi>Glaſs</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> and in the <hi>Firſt Fits,</hi> where there is a plain <hi>Plethora,</hi> and the <hi>Defluxion</hi> falls violently like a <hi>Torrent,</hi> it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be a Proper Preparative to other Medicines, yet this can only prove a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion from the Parts affected, and it may qualifie the Heat and Ebullition of the Bloud, but muſt ſtill leave the Parts (if other Methods ſucceed not) in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture weakneſs, or diſpoſition to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.

The Eyes, and the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52455:141"/>
Optick Nerves are very ſenſibly weakned by Veneſection, the very day that it is performed, and though in Younger peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that weakneſs is ſoon enough repaired again, yet it plainly ſhews that in all Diſeaſes which proceed eſpecially from a weakneſs of the Nerves, this Remedy ought to be uſed with very great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not without ſome Neceſſity, on account of the Feaver, or Inflamation.</p>
               <p>In Elder perſons, or in Habituated Gouts, the uſe of the Lancet is almoſt as much to be dreaded, as a Dagger ſtuck to the Heart.

                  <hi>Solenander,</hi> a Sober and Good Author, reckons up two perſons that he knew, who upon unadviſed, or unfortunate Bleeding in the Fit, did one grow quite Paralytick, and loſt the uſe of his Arm afterwards, and t'other made his Gout Knotted by that means. And Examples of that kind are not rare. <hi>Galen</hi> indeed adviſes Bleeding Spring and Fall, as a Preſervative againſt the Gout. But they muſt be very Young, and Sanguine, and they muſt not have ſuffered the Gout long, to whom that Remedy can be ſafe and Good.</p>

                  <hi>Emeticks</hi> indeed are a <hi>Noble Remedy,</hi> both by way of <hi>Preſervative,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before the <hi>Fit</hi> is over. <hi>One Vomit</hi> ſhall oftentimes do more than <hi>divers Purges,</hi> as making a <hi>Strong Revulſion</hi> from the Parts affected; as clearing the <hi>Stomach</hi> (the depravation of whoſe Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions is a main original cauſe) of thoſe humours which pervert its <hi>Chylification;</hi> as alſo freeing the <hi>Principal Parts</hi> adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> which do all by <hi>Conſent</hi> unburthen themſelves thither, during the operation of the <hi>Vomit;</hi> and laſtly as wonderfully freeing the <hi>Head,</hi> and the <hi>Nerves</hi> of <hi>Phlegmatick,</hi> or <hi>Serous</hi> matter for defluxions.

                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:52455:147"/>
and <hi>Abſtemious</hi> above ours. I don't doubt but they knew the <hi>taſte</hi> of a Glaſs of <hi>Wine</hi> as well as our times, and as few of them were <hi>Women-haters</hi> as now.

               <p>As for <hi>Eunuchs</hi> being now ſometimes troubled with the <hi>Gout,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his aſſertion to the contrary, we muſt know, that in all probability our <hi>Maſter</hi> did mean ſuch <hi>Eunuchs</hi> only, as either were born without <hi>any Neceſſaries</hi> for <hi>Coition,</hi> or were <hi>intirely deprived</hi> of them ſoon after they were born, as is now the manner of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and not

concerning thoſe <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived only of their <hi>Teſticles,</hi> but had their <hi>Virga,</hi> and <hi>Scrotum</hi> remaining, upon which ſort <hi>Martial</hi> was a little pleaſant in his time, in that jocular Diſtich:</p>

               </q>
               <p>And if they are ſtill capable of doing in private ſuch feats of activity, as gave occaſion to the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi> to make a <hi>through Exection</hi> of their <hi>Generative Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and beſides can ſwill a <hi>Glaſs</hi> as freely as thoſe who are not <hi>Caſtrated,</hi> nay and can <hi>impair</hi> the <hi>tone</hi> of their <hi>Spirits</hi> upon other accounts, what ſhould hinder them from becoming <hi>Arthritick</hi> as well as others? There are four things requiſite to breed the <hi>Gout,</hi> according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Antients; <hi>an imbecillity of the Joynts, an expanſion, or dilatation of the Veins about them, Crude matter to flow that way, and an impelling principle, chiefly a Flatus.</hi> Now if a young luſty Fellow happens to be made an <hi>Eunuch</hi> only in <hi>Martial</hi>'s ſence, after he has ſufficiently known what's what, and thereby, as well as other ways, weakned the Natural
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52455:148"/>
ſtrength of the <hi>Joynts,</hi> and dilated the <hi>Veins</hi> about them, certainly he is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards capable of diſordering his body with <hi>Intemperance,</hi> thereby furniſhing <hi>Crude indigeſted</hi> matter, and <hi>Wine</hi> will provide him with an <hi>Impelling Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>

                  <hi>That Sick people are apt to do themſelves injury, by following too ſpare a Diet, and this is the more inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to them.

               <p>It is to be obſerved, that of thoſe who labour under this <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> the <hi>generality,</hi> if not <hi>all,</hi> are men of <hi>great Senſe</hi> and <hi>Brains,</hi> and their <hi>Spirits</hi> are <hi>much,</hi> if not <hi>always</hi> employed in very <hi>intenſe thinking.</hi> And if <hi>Fools</hi> do chance to come by it, as well as <hi>Wiſe</hi> men, it is to be imputed to their <hi>Fooliſh Extravagancies,</hi> whereof <hi>ſome</hi> will exhauſt, and impair the <hi>Spirits,</hi> as much as <hi>Immoderate Studies,</hi> and <hi>long fixedneſs of thoughts.</hi> But I dare appeal to any man, who has known the World, whither it be not exceeding rare to meet a man of <hi>weak,</hi> or <hi>very ordinary intellectuals,</hi>

much afflicted with this <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi> Now the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> which more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately perform the <hi>functions</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> being in theſe <hi>thoughtful</hi> men upon very <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>hard Duty,</hi> do call in to their <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> thoſe <hi>Spirits,</hi> whoſe part is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly deſigned to help the buſineſs of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</hi> So that the <hi>Stomach</hi> finding its ſelf deſtitute of thoſe neceſſary helps which it uſes to receive in order to <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Concoction,</hi> can therefore do its work only by <hi>halfs,</hi> and ſo heaps up <hi>Crude</hi> and <hi>indigeſted humours</hi> in the body, which <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> finding at laſt to grow very <hi>offenſive,</hi> and threatning to attack the main <hi>Forts</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Vital parts,</hi> does in great kindneſs to them, throw them off upon the <hi>Outward.</hi> We know that an <hi>Error</hi> in the <hi>firſt Concoction,</hi> cannot be rectified in the <hi>ſecond</hi> or <hi>third.</hi> Let but the <hi>Spring</hi> of a <hi>Watch</hi> flag in its due <hi>force,</hi> and though the <hi>Wheels</hi> and other parts be never ſo curiouſly and exactly wrought, yet the <hi>Watch</hi> can never go right, becauſe all the reſt depends upon the <hi>firſt-Elaſtick</hi> motion of the <hi>Spring.</hi> And thus the <hi>Stomach</hi> being the main <hi>Spring</hi> of <hi>Digeſtion,</hi> and upon whoſe regular, or irregular functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do abſolutely depend all the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent acts of <hi>Sangnification</hi> in the <hi>Blood,</hi>

and <hi>Aſſimilation</hi> in all the parts of the body, if the <hi>Spirits</hi> at due times are not ſufficiently relaxed from <hi>intenſe Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the <hi>Stomach</hi> aſſiſted with as many of them as are requiſite to the <hi>firſt Concoction,</hi> or <hi>Chylyfication,</hi> there is like to be a moſt natural inlet to ſuch <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> as the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the body inclines to, and particularly the <hi>Gout</hi> in thoſe whoſe other circumſtances do concur towards its production.

               <p>Now though this may in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be a more general <hi>Procatarctick Cauſe,</hi> than others, yet no <hi>Author,</hi> that I know of, has made <hi>any words</hi> about it.

Sir <hi>Theodore Mayern</hi> indeed, who has written a <hi>ſhort</hi> but <hi>judicious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> of this <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> makes the <hi>Stomach</hi> (not the <hi>Head,</hi> or <hi>Liver</hi>) to be the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Fountain</hi> from whence thoſe <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions</hi> are derived to the <hi>Joynts.</hi> And therefore <hi>Diaeteticks</hi> are in his opinion a main inſtrument in the <hi>Cure.</hi> The <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> is doubtleſs firſt of all affected, and it very often comes to be ſo, by reaſon of the <hi>Spirits</hi> being too much employed in the Brain. For whither <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> or <hi>Corporeal,</hi> or <hi>Mental Exerciſe</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> do <hi>weaken</hi> their natural <hi>craſis,</hi> it is certain that they are <hi>weakned,</hi> and being ſo, the <hi>Nervous Parts</hi> muſt on that account be as ſubject to receive morbid impreſſions, as <hi>Infirmities</hi> and <hi>Weakneſſes</hi> in other parts do likewiſe become <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive.</hi> But that a very <hi>Spare Diet</hi> is the moſt proper courſe to <hi>reſtore</hi> the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> or to <hi>prevent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders</hi>

from falling on the <hi>Joynts,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but very much queſtion.

               <p>Now we cannot deny but <hi>Diet</hi> is of great concern in ſo conſiderable a <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Diſtemper, and eſpecially to <hi>thoſe</hi> perſons who think fit to quit themſelves of their <hi>Phyſician,</hi> ſo ſoon as they are got a little rid of their <hi>Paroxiſin,</hi> or thoſe who over-wiſely leave all to the <hi>Courſe</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> Seaſonable and proper <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations</hi> carefully followed at certain times, will leave the <hi>leſs neceſſity,</hi> perhaps <hi>none</hi> at all, of being <hi>Curious</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
               <p>Before I diſmiſs this ſubject, I cannot but ſpeak one word to the <hi>Milk Diet,</hi> that being oftentimes the <hi>Laſt Refuge,</hi> and having gained greater Fame than any other. Some indeed have had the good Fortune to receive benefit from it, or to think ſo at leaſt, for a time; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of this <hi>Diet,</hi> in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſes by Eminent and Worthy <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,</hi> where they have had ſufficient Experience of the <hi>Idioſyncraſia,</hi> or pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Tempers of their Patients, has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged ſome others to venture upon it of their own head, and they have paid
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52455:155"/>
dearly for their Raſhneſs, by its abſolute diſagreement. For <hi>Milk</hi> is a contrary to thoſe men, whoſe <hi>Habit</hi> of body is <hi>Acid,</hi> and <hi>Melancholick,</hi> (and <hi>Thoughtful</hi> men are very apt to degenerate into <hi>that</hi> State) and as contrary to ſuch who have inured themſelves to the conſtant ſervice of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> as <hi>Beef</hi> and <hi>Pork</hi> to the <hi>Stomach</hi> of a little <hi>Infant.</hi> Theſe mens <hi>Stomachs</hi> ſhall <hi>ſowre</hi> and <hi>curdle Milk,</hi> as certainly as <hi>Vinegar</hi> or other <hi>Acids,</hi> when ſet over the fire. Beſides it is very <hi>unnatural,</hi> and <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous</hi> to make <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and to accommodate the <hi>proper Diet</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> to the <hi>other,</hi> unleſs it be upon ſome <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> occaſions weighed and deliberated with the utmoſt care and nicety, and with the <hi>Advice</hi> of ſome <hi>Good Phyſician.</hi> And in this caſe the <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> reſpecting <hi>Diet,</hi> that was mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ought well to be remembred.</p>
               <p>Thus I have been longer than I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, upon this <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> and I hope <hi>ſome Hints</hi> may not be altogether <hi>

               <p>AS it was a Cuſtom in old times, for <hi>Phyſicians</hi> to apply themſelves chiefly, if not ſolely, to <hi>one Kind</hi> of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,</hi> ſo there were others full as Zealous, that they ſhould keep themſelves ſtrictly to one ſort of <hi>Simple</hi> in their <hi>Cures.</hi> Nor were <hi>good women,</hi> and <hi>Country people</hi> the only perſons, who had a great opinion of <hi>Cures</hi> being wrought by <hi>Simples,</hi> but

even <hi>Phyſicians</hi> of the greateſt note and honeſty have very much favour'd it. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſcorides,</hi> who liv'd in <hi>Julius Ceſar</hi>'s time, deſcribed the <hi>Virtues</hi> of <hi>Simple Plants,</hi> with an excellency that few have ſince imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and <hi>Matthiolus</hi> his juſtly admirable <hi>Comments</hi> upon him, writ a long time after, has improved, and is like to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate our <hi>Neceſſary Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> And the ſubſtance of both their works has been reduced into a <hi>moſt eaſie</hi> and <hi>applicable Method,</hi> by <hi>Juſtus Mollerus,</hi> in his <hi>Faſciculus Remediorum ex Diofco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride &amp; Matthiolo.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Simple Medicaments</hi> have proved ſingularly Good in the <hi>Cure</hi> of divers <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,</hi> it would be unworthy to deny.

               <p>Some <hi>Authors</hi> do make us to be very much beholding to <hi>Beaſts</hi> for our <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> And thus the <hi>Weazle</hi> being to encounter the <hi>Baſilisk,</hi> is ſaid by <hi>Natural Inſtinct,</hi> to defend it ſelf with <hi>Rue.</hi> The <hi>Serpent,</hi> when grown old, is ſaid to have learn'd the Cunning to apply

               </p>
               <p>I have ſhewed before, that <hi>Nature</hi> does <hi>Compound Remedies,</hi> as well as <hi>Art,</hi> and as <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> are <hi>Complicated,</hi> the <hi>Medicines</hi> muſt be ſo likewiſe. And therefore to decry all <hi>Compoſitions</hi> as <hi>

or accidental effects of <hi>Sigills, Characters,</hi> and <hi>Amulets.</hi> For it cannot be denied, but that many People, and eſpecially the more <hi>weak</hi> and ſimple, have found ſtrange, and, to their ſeeming, <hi>Miraculous Cures,</hi> from ſuch really <hi>Ridiculous Artifices.</hi> It would be endleſs to name the <hi>Conceits,</hi> whereby <hi>Agues</hi> particularly have been removed.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:52455:166"/>
uſes deſperate expreſſions to gain a full belief, the <hi>Sick</hi> man is throughly ſatisfied in his <hi>Imagination,</hi> makes trial of the <hi>Charm,</hi> and finds immediate <hi>Succeſs,</hi> as he thinks from the <hi>Charm,</hi> but really and truly is beholding to the <hi>Strong Deluſion</hi> of his own <hi>Imagination.</hi> Upon this the <hi>Empirick</hi> is more confident (if poſſible) than before, and another, and another <hi>Neighbour,</hi> all as <hi>wiſe</hi> as the <hi>firſt,</hi> do fall to try the ſame <hi>Experiment,</hi> and, to the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Charm,</hi> it has the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable effect in them all. And thus they ſhall go on a good while, until at laſt the <hi>Fame</hi> of this <hi>Eaſie Remedy</hi> flying far and near, a man of deeper <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> is over-perſwaded by his Friends to try this <hi>Infallible Remedy,</hi> and he does it, but with ſuch a <hi>deſponding mind,</hi> and ſo many <hi>Doubts</hi> ariſing from the ordinary dictates of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that the <hi>Charm</hi> becomes <hi>ineffectual,</hi> the <hi>Ague</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, and the <hi>Empirick</hi> begins to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</hi> Nevertheleſs others try their fortune, and the ſtrength of <hi>Imagination</hi> loſing its force, by degrees <hi>that Charm</hi> is ſilenced, and the <hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Agues</hi> returns into the hands of <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> as they did before, until ſome other <hi>New Artifice,</hi> of the very <hi>ſame Virtue,</hi> and with the <hi>ſame
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:52455:166"/>
Pretenſions,</hi> for a while, amuſes the minds of men. And in confirmation of what I ſay, I could name a remarkable <hi>City</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> where it is well known, and generally acknowledged, that for almoſt one whole year, a <hi>Silly Charm</hi> did <hi>Cure Agues</hi> with a kind of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and yet the very next year was attended with ſo much <hi>Fallibility,</hi> that not <hi>one,</hi> as I have heard, was <hi>Cured</hi> by it.</p>
               <p>Now that the <hi>Imagination,</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> of <hi>Fancy,</hi> is the <hi>Real Cauſe,</hi> that the <hi>Charm,</hi> or be it what it will of the like nature, did at firſt prove <hi>ſucceſsful</hi> in the <hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Agues,</hi> might be proved from its great power in other reſpects, which I ſhall urge more anon, and at preſent will give one inſtance, that is not a little to our purpoſe. An <hi>Ingenious Gentleman</hi> of my acquaintance, making a viſit to a <hi>Good Family,</hi> found the <hi>Beloved Daughter</hi> moſt ſadly altered with a <hi>Long</hi> and <hi>Violent Ague;</hi> he being a man of <hi>Addreſs,</hi> and experienced <hi>knowledge</hi> in the World, was pleaſed, without heſitation, to deliver himſelf to this effect unto the <hi>Mother,</hi> in the preſence of the <hi>Sickly Daughter: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> I am glad that I came ſo ſeaſonably to ſerve you in this particular, it has been my fortune to be well acquainted
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:52455:167"/>
with a certain <hi>Jew,</hi> who had one of the moſt <hi>Infallible Arts</hi> in <hi>Caring Agues</hi> that ever yet has been known, he learn'd it in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and after much Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Kindneſs, and a great <hi>Sum</hi> of <hi>Money,</hi> that I paid him for the <hi>Secret,</hi> he imparted it unto <hi>me;</hi> it is only the <hi>wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> a <hi>Powder</hi> that he brought from the <hi>Indies</hi> next the <hi>Heart.</hi> At this they all rejoyced, and conſented immediately to try it; he goes into another room, takes a little of the <hi>Aſhes</hi> that he found in the <hi>Chimney,</hi> and <hi>Seals</hi> it up in a <hi>Paper,</hi> the young <hi>Lady</hi> did wear it next her <hi>Heart,</hi> and was thereby freed from her <hi>Ague,</hi> without any more ado. And thus, no doubt, upon the ſame <hi>operation</hi> of <hi>Fancy,</hi> not only thouſands of <hi>Agues</hi> at different times, but <hi>other Diſeaſes</hi> have hapned to be <hi>Cured,</hi> to the great aſtoniſhment of By-ſtanders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Authors</hi> do affirm, and poſſibly with truth enough, that this <hi>Amulet</hi> has <hi>Cured</hi> the <hi>Tooth-ach, Galbes, Galbat, Galdes, Galda:</hi> That <hi>Fluxes</hi> of <hi>Bloud</hi> have been ſtop'd by theſe wiſe words, <hi>Charat, Cara, Sarite, Confirma, Conſona, Imaholite;</hi> or otherwiſe by the word <hi>Socnon, Socnon,</hi> repeated ſeven and twenty times, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Bloud ſtops, and alſo touching the

               <p>As <hi>Characters,</hi> ſo <hi>Sigills, Images,</hi> or Impreſſions of ſeveral ſorts are thought to be wonderfully effectual, both in the Cure of Diſeaſes, and on divers other accounts.

                  </note> will be a <hi>Romance</hi> to me, however <hi>Martinus del Rio</hi> ſets forth the relation. We ought to conſider, that heretofore the <hi>World</hi> was <hi>involved</hi> in a <hi>dark</hi> and diſmal <hi>ignorance,</hi> and then it was no ſtrange thing for a thouſand <hi>Stratagems</hi> to amuſe <hi>Credulous</hi> people. <hi>Cunning Knaves</hi> could in thoſe days do a great many tricks, which would aſtoniſh the <hi>vulgar,</hi> and even <hi>puzle wiſe</hi> men, but now the World is enlightned, thoſe <hi>Arts</hi> are all <hi>certainly</hi> vaniſhed, and nothing but <hi>Superſtition,</hi> a deluge of groſs <hi>Superſtition</hi> can <hi>revive</hi> them again.</p>
               <p>For although the World in general is as <hi>Naturally</hi> inclined to <hi>Superſtition,</hi> as to any <hi>one Vice</hi> that can be named, yet it is never like to over-whelm <hi>Europe</hi> as it has done; we have now greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to diſcover <hi>double-dealing,</hi> than they had in former times, and it is now a very hard matter to contrive a <hi>Confederacy,</hi> which may avoid being diſcovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:52455:170"/>If the World did not <hi>love Superſtition,</hi> as much as their very <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> ſo many <hi>Pſeudo-mancys</hi> as there are would never have prevailed upon the minds of men. Not only <hi>Negromancy</hi> has been an <hi>Art,</hi> but even <hi>Pyromancy, Hydromancy, Geomancy, Oneiromancy, Icthuomancy,</hi> nay <hi>Capnomancy, Alphitomancy, Belomancy, Axinomancy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Predictions,</hi> and <hi>Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtications</hi> have been made from <hi>Fire, Water, Earth, Fiſhes, Dreams,</hi> nay from <hi>Smoke, Meal, Arrows,</hi> the <hi>Ax;</hi> from <hi>Birds,</hi> particularly <hi>Crows,</hi> from inſpection of the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of a humane body, as well as from the <hi>Hand,</hi> the <hi>Face,</hi> &amp;c. There have been <hi>Divinations</hi> by a <hi>Sieve,</hi> by the <hi>burning</hi> of <hi>Frankinſenſe,</hi> and laſtly from the <hi>Stars.</hi> I do not think there can be a thing ſo <hi>Ridiculous</hi> in nature, let but <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Caſualty</hi> (a <hi>ſure</hi> way of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!) attend it, and men may reduce it into as <hi>Good</hi> an <hi>Art,</hi> as <hi>moſt,</hi> if not <hi>all</hi> thoſe above-named.

                  <hi>Mountebanks</hi> in other Countries are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed as the very <hi>Dirt,</hi> they are not only the <hi>Scum,</hi> but even the <hi>Scorn</hi> of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People,</hi> and though poſſibly they may get <hi>Money</hi> enough abroad, and upon that account may be allowed to hold up

their heads, yet their very <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſteemed the moſt palpable <hi>Cheating</hi> and <hi>Lying,</hi> gives them a <hi>contempt,</hi> which they can never afterwards ſurmount. But here in <hi>England</hi> the caſe is altered, many a <hi>Mountebank</hi> has not only fleeced the poor people of their ſmall Sums, which they moſt freely contribute for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of being thus deluded, but they have the peoples Hearts in kindneſs, and their Caps in reverence to them; they ſhall Honour a pittiful <hi>Mountebank equally</hi> with a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> nay ſome are ſo <hi>Sottiſh</hi> as to give the <hi>Impoſtor</hi> even a precedency of favour.</p>
               <p>Therefore that the World may know a little of theſe men, which they have not heard of perhaps before, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Memory of our <hi>Famous Pontaeus; Famous</hi> not only for the <hi>Sums</hi> he pick'd up by this kind of Artifice, but for the <hi>Reputation</hi> and Honour which he gained to the <hi>Mountebanks</hi> baſe Trade, and who alone may be thought to have had more <hi>Real Knowledge,</hi> as well as <hi>Cunning,</hi> than whole <hi>Shoals</hi> of our <hi>Modern Tribe.</hi> I ſhall deſcribe both the manner of his giving <hi>Rank Poyſons,</hi> and the <hi>Method</hi> of his <hi>Man</hi>'s <hi>waſhing</hi> his <hi>hands</hi> in <hi>Scalding Lead,</hi> and leave you thereby to judge,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:52455:175"/>
whither his <hi>Antidote,</hi> which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the one <hi>Exploit,</hi> were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality the better for it, and whither his <hi>Oyntment</hi> or <hi>Balſom,</hi> which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the other, were the more <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> againſt <hi>Burns,</hi> for what he ſhewed upon the <hi>Stage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is known, that <hi>Pontaeus,</hi> the firſt <hi>Mountebank</hi> that ever appeared on a <hi>Stage</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> made a <hi>Challenge</hi> to the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to prepare for one of his Servants, the <hi>Rankeſt Poyſon</hi> that they could contrive, and he ſhould venture to take it before them all, publickly upon his <hi>Stage.</hi> The <hi>Phyſicians</hi> upon <hi>Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> agreed to give him a quantity of <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> as thinking that his <hi>Stomach</hi> muſt be a <hi>good</hi> one, which could reſiſt ſo <hi>Powerful</hi> a <hi>Corroſive,</hi> a <hi>Corroſive</hi> that could diſſolve all <hi>Metals</hi> beſides <hi>Gold,</hi> and could eat through an inch-board. <hi>Pontaeus</hi> his man takes it cleaverly off, to the <hi>amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of all <hi>Spectators,</hi> and to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable <hi>praiſe</hi> of his Maſters thereby <hi>Popular Antidote.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of all was thus: <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus</hi> Prepares the Fellow, with forcing down no leſs than <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three pounds</hi> of the <hi>Freſheſt Butter</hi> that could be made, and after he had thus ſufficiently greaſed
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:52455:176"/>
his <hi>Gullet,</hi> and his <hi>Mouth</hi> was armed againſt the <hi>Poyſon</hi> with a good gobbet of <hi>Butter,</hi> he ſwallows it down almoſt as <hi>Innocently</hi> as a <hi>Glaſs</hi> of <hi>Wine.</hi> But he was taught to <hi>fall down as Dead,</hi> and <hi>as ſuch</hi> was carried off the <hi>Stage,</hi> to be put into a warm <hi>Bed,</hi> and to experience his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Antidote;</hi> when he was once in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, he ſoon diſcharged up the <hi>Aqua Fortis;</hi> for having good ſtore of <hi>Warm Water,</hi> and more <hi>Butter</hi> ready provided, the firſt did ſerve to <hi>dilute,</hi> and the other to <hi>blunt</hi> ſufficiently the force of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Spirit;</hi> and ſo after a few minutes <hi>Vomiting,</hi> the man was as ſound, and heart-whole, as another, and had little need of <hi>other Antidotes,</hi> than what he had taken already. But nevertheleſs the next day he appear'd on the <hi>Stage</hi> again, the people behold him as a <hi>man Riſen from the Dead,</hi> their hearts yearn to ſee him again, and joyfully <hi>congratulate</hi> his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</hi> The <hi>Antidote</hi> is then magnified with a ſtronger <hi>Argument</hi> than <hi>Reaſon</hi> can anſwer, and let <hi>Phyſicians</hi> ſay what they will againſt it, people <hi>will,</hi> and think they <hi>may</hi> ſafely enough believe their own <hi>Eyes.</hi> Whereas in reality this <hi>Antidote</hi> proves but a piece of <hi>Legerdemaine,</hi> and <hi>Black-cherry Water</hi> would have been as
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:52455:176"/>
much a <hi>Preſervative</hi> againſt the <hi>Poyſon,</hi> as the <hi>Antidote</hi> its ſelf. For the <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> were the true <hi>Alexipharmick;</hi> the one kept off, and the other waſh'd off the powerful <hi>Corroſive Spirit.</hi> But he was not ſo dull a <hi>Hocus,</hi> as to let his <hi>Trick</hi> be ſeen <hi>through.</hi> It was the man's Part to <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>ſhew</hi> to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, it was the <hi>Peoples</hi> Part to <hi>See,</hi> and to <hi>Wonder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another <hi>Mountebank</hi> very lately in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-Garden,</hi> and <hi>Lincolus-Inn-Fields,</hi> did alarm the Wonderment of the common people, by the taking of <hi>Arſenick,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the vending <hi>an Orvietan.</hi> It ſeems he could not be perſwaded to venture upon <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> as probably not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo well how to <hi>Prepare</hi> his <hi>body,</hi> as the <hi>Italian Pontaeus</hi> had done before him. But that this <hi>German</hi> did proceed in a <hi>like,</hi> though not ſo <hi>good</hi> a <hi>Method</hi> as <hi>Pontaeus,</hi> may be judged from this, that ſo ſoon as the <hi>Mountebank</hi> had taken his doſe of <hi>Arſenick,</hi> and retreated to his Chamber, in order to take a <hi>Nap</hi> (as he ſaid) during the rencounter of the <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and his <hi>Orvietan;</hi> ſo ſoon as the people were diſmiſſed, the <hi>Neighbours</hi> in the <hi>next Houſe</hi> heard ſuch a <hi>noiſe</hi> in the <hi>Quacks Chàmber,</hi> as plainly diſcovered the

                  <hi>Operation</hi> of an <hi>Emetick,</hi> rather than any deſign (as he pretended) of <hi>Sleeping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is a thing well worth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of <hi>Publick Authority,</hi> whither ſuch <hi>groſs Deluſions,</hi> upon the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the <hi>common People,</hi> deſerve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with <hi>Countenance</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> and whither <hi>fatal conſequences</hi> may not be apt ſometimes to follow, if a <hi>Credulous,</hi> or <hi>Ignorant,</hi> or <hi>over-bold</hi> perſon, ſhould in his <hi>Drink,</hi> or in a ridiculous <hi>Frolick,</hi> make trial of the Virtues of this man's <hi>Orvietan,</hi> with a much ſmaller quantity of <hi>Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi> or if one that has hapned to take <hi>Poyſon</hi> by ſome accident, ſhould neglect the proper means of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and put all to the trial of his <hi>Mountebank's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if a man ſhould have ſeen <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus Acting</hi> the following <hi>Force,</hi> who could have doubted the <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and more than ordinary <hi>Excellence</hi> of his <hi>Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> againſt <hi>Burns,</hi> and <hi>Scaldings?</hi> He cauſes a <hi>fire</hi> to be brought upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> and a <hi>Veſſel</hi> placed upon the <hi>Fire,</hi> full (they ſay) of <hi>Melted Lead.</hi> One of his Fellow is appointed to <hi>waſh</hi> his <hi>hands</hi> in the <hi>Lead,</hi> as 'tis poured out upon them. The Fellow underſtands his <hi>Part</hi> very well, makes ſower faces, and roars and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:52455:177"/>
ſqualls as if he were to be killed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but flinches not from the matter, until every body has ſeen enough; and that he might be ſure not to flinch from his Office, the man's hands are manacled together, that he might not, if he would, ſeem to draw off, but yet left in ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, that he might waſh them freely. Then (poor man!) he muſt appear a very lamentable Spectacle, but the <hi>Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is ſoon applied to his <hi>Scalded Hands,</hi> and they are ſwathed up very deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if his <hi>Wounds</hi> were little leſs than <hi>Mortal.</hi> And yet after all, this <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit</hi> is no more hurt than you are, and the <hi>Oyntment</hi> might as well have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Behind,</hi> as <hi>where</hi> it was put; and the whole <hi>Myſtery</hi> was thus; a quantity of <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> was <hi>juſt ſet</hi> over the <hi>fire,</hi> in a <hi>Ladle</hi> painted <hi>Red</hi> round about, as if it were <hi>Red-hot,</hi> and ſomething added to raiſe a little <hi>ſteam,</hi> which was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be derived from his <hi>Scalded Hands,</hi> the man holds Vermilion concealed in each hand to give them a <hi>Scalding Coulour,</hi> while he waſhes, and what through his trembling and woful behaviour, and what through the great conſternation that appeared in the whole <hi>Crew,</hi> one would almoſt <hi>Swear</hi> the man were <hi>half
