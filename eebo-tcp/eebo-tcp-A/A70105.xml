            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THey are great strangers to the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the World, who know not how many and various the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the <hi>Papists</hi> have been, both to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all endeavours towards a <hi>Reformation,</hi> &amp; to overthrow and subvert it where <hi>it</hi> hath obtained and prevailed.

How have all the Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> been soak't with the Blood of Saints, through the Barbarous Rage of <hi>Popish Rulers,</hi> whom the <hi>Roman Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> stirred up and instigated, in order to support themselves in their secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar grandure, and in their Tyranny over the Consciences of men, and to keep the World in Slavery under Ignorance, Errors, Superstition and Idolatry, which the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Christianity again to the Rule of the Gospel, would have redeemed mankind from, and been an effectual means to have dissipated and subverted? They of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Communion, having strangely corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Christian Religion in its Faith, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and Discipline, and having prodigiously altered it, from what it was in the Doctrines and Institutions of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles;</hi> they found no other way whereby to sustain their Errors and Corruptions, and to preserve themselves in the possession of that Empire, which they had usurped over Conscience, and in the enjoyment of the Wealth and secular Greatness, which by working upon the Ignorance, Superstition, Lusts, and Prophanness of People, they had skrewed and wound themselves into, but by adjudging all who durst detect or oppose them, to fire and Sword, or to miseries, to which Death in its worst shape were prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

since the beginning of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affording us in some place or another, renewed evidences of <hi>Papal</hi> Charity, and of the <hi>Roman</hi> method of hindring the growth of Heresie, either by a Massacre, War, or Persecution, begun, and executed, upon no other account or provocation, but meerly that of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and because we cannot believe and practice in the matters of God, as they do. And having obtained of late, great Advantages for the pursuing their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice against us, more boldly and avowedly than at an other Season, and that not only through a strange concurrence and conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Princes</hi> in the <hi>Papal</hi> Communion, who are more intoxicated with their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions and Idolatries, or less wise, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and humane, than some of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors of that Fellowship were, but through having obtained a <hi>Prince</hi> intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted unto them, &amp; under the implicit gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their Priests, to be advanced unto a Throne, where such sometime used to sit, as were the Terror of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of oppresed <hi>Protestants;</hi> they have thereupon both assumed a Courage of stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up new and unpresidented Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in divers places, against the most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, best and loyallest of Subjects, upon no other charge or Allegation, but for dissenting from the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Faith, and denying Subjection to the Tripple Crown, and are raised into a Confidence of wholly Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating <hi>Protestancy,</hi> and of reestablishing the <hi>Papal</hi> Tyrannies and Superstition, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Countries</hi> whence they had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, or stood so depressed and discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, as that the Votaries and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans of their <hi>Church,</hi> had not the Sway and Domination. Nor need we any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction both of their Design, and of their Confidence of Succeeding in it, than what they have already done, &amp; continue to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue in <hi>France, Hungary</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their prospering to such a degree in their Cruel and Barbarous Attempts, not only gives them boldness of entertaining thoughts of taking the like Methods, and Acting by the same measures, in all places where they find Rulers at their beck, and under their Influence, but to unite and provoke all <hi>Popish Monarchs</hi> to enter into a holy War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Protestants</hi> every where, that by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and Subduing those <hi>States</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> where the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and established, they may extirpate it out of the World, under the Notion of the <hi>Northern</hi> Heresie. If principles of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Maxim's of Interest, Rules of Policy, Obligations of Gratitude, Ties of Royal and Princely Faith, or the repeated Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, Oaths, Edicts, and Declarations of Soveraigns, could have been a Security to <hi>Protestants,</hi> for the Profession of their Faith and Exercise of their Worship, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Territories and Dominions, they had all that could be rationally desired, for their Safety and Protection, in the free and open profession and Practice of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> whereas by a violation of all that is Sacred among men, of a binding vertu un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Princes (except Chains and Fetters) or that confer a Right, Claim, and Security unto Subjects, the poor <hi>Protestants</hi> in those Places, have been, and still are, persecuted with a rage and Barbarity, which no age can parallel, and for which it is difficult to find words proper and severe enough, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to stamp a Character of infamy, upon the treacherous, cruel, and savage Authors, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters, and Instruments of it.

And the <hi>French King</hi> tho he stand not much commended for sweetness and Benignity of disposition, is known to be unmeasurably Ambitious, of having his name transmitted to Posterity in Letters of Greatness and Honor, which his behaviour towards his Subjects of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion,</hi> is no way's adapted unto, but calculated to make him hereafter listed with <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Julian.</hi> As to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> there seems by the whole course of his other Actions, to be a certain Greatness of Mind in him, not easily consisting with that savage and brutal temper, which the Cruelties he hath exercised upon the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> would intimate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note. But it ariseth from the Mischievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Pestilency of their Religion, their Bigottry in it, and their having put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so entirely under the conduct of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> particularly of the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> who are for the most part a set of men, especially the latter, that through acting in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of no other Ends, but the Grandure, Wealth, and Domination of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> do with an unlimited rage, and a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kind of Malice, persecute all that have renounced Fellowship with it, and care not if they Sacrifice the Honor, Glory and Safety of <hi>Monarchs,</hi> and bring their Kingdoms into contempt and desolation, by rendring them weak, poor, and dispeopled, provided they may wreck their spleen, and revenge, upon those, whose Religion is not only dissonant from theirs, but should it prevail to be the Religion of the <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of Nations, those springs of Wealth would be immediately dried up, by which their Superior <hi>Clergy,</hi> and all their Religious <hi>Orders</hi> are enriched and fed up in idleness.

Beside the innumerable instances of the Tragical Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>Romish Bigottry,</hi> that are to be met with in Books of all kinds, we need go no further for an evidence of it, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the Life of <hi>Dominick,</hi> the great Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Promoter of the Massacre of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and the Founder of that <hi>Order,</hi> which hath the Management of the bloody <hi>Inquisition;</hi> together with the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>third</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who contrary to the advice of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the repeated intreaties of the wisest of his own Councellors, the <hi>Chancellor de l'Hospital,</hi> and the <hi>President de Thou,</hi> not only revived the War and Persecution against his <hi>Reformed Subjects,</hi> after he had seen what Judgments, the like proceedings had derived upon his Predecessors, and how prejudicial they had proved to the Strength, Glory, and Interest of his <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but he entred into a <hi>League</hi> with those that sought to depress, abdicate, and depose him, and became the Head of a Faction for the destroying that part of his Subjects, upon whom alone he could rely for the defence of his person, and support of his Dignity. Nor were the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Duke de Alva</hi> heretofore, or the present Barbarities of <hi>Louis</hi> the <hi>Fourteenth,</hi> so much the effects of their haughtie and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tempers, as of their <hi>Bigottry</hi> in their inhumane and sanguinary Religion. That the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is second to none, in a blind and rageful Popish Zeal, his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour both while a Subject, and since he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the <hi>Crown,</hi> doth not only place it beyond the limits of a bare suspition, but affords us such evidences of it, as that none
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29511:5"/>
in consistency with principles of wisdom, and discretion, can either question or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it. To what else can we ascribe it, but to an excessive <hi>Bigottry,</hi> that when the <hi>Frigat</hi> wherein he was sailing to <hi>Scotland anno</hi> 1682. struck upon the Sands, and was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to sink, he should prefer the Lives of one or two pittiful <hi>Priests,</hi> to those of men of the greatest <hi>Quality,</hi> and receive those mushrom's into the Boat, in which himself escaped, while at the same time, he refused to admit, not only his own <hi>Brother-in-Law,</hi> but divers Noblemen of the Supreamest Rank, and Character, to the benefit of the same means of deliverance, and suffered them to perish, tho they had undertaken that Voyage out of pure respect to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and to put an Honor upon him, at a Season, when he wanted not Enemies. Nor can it proceed from any thing but a violent and furious <hi>Bigottry,</hi> that he should not only disoblige and disgust the two <hi>Universities,</hi> of whose Zeal to his service, <hi>he</hi> hath received so many seasonable and effectual Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but to the violation both of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> offer force to their Consciences, as well as to their Rights and Franchises, and all this in favour of <hi>Father Francis,</hi> whom he would illegally thrust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Fellowship</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> whom he would arbitrarily obtrude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Headship</hi> of a <hi>Colledg</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> who as they are too despicable to be owned, and stood for, in competition against two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Universities,</hi> whose greatest crime, hath been an excess of zeal for his person, and interest, when he was <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and a measure of Loyalty, and Obedience, unto him, since <hi>he</hi> came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> beyond what either the Rules of Christianity, or the Laws of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> exact from them; so he hath way's enough of expressing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and bounty, to those two little contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Creatures, and that in methods as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to them, as the places into which <hi>he</hi> would thrust them, can be supposed to amount unto, and I am sure with less scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to himself, and less offence to all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> as well as without offering inj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Nor is His <hi>Majesties</hi> being under the influence of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> thro having <hi>one</hi> of them for his <hi>Confessor,</hi> and several of them for his Chief Councellors and principal Confidents, the only thing in this matter that awakens our fear in what we are to expect from his armed power, excited and stirred by that fiery <hi>Tribe;</hi> but there is another ground why we ought more especially to dread him, and that is <hi>his</hi> being entred and enrolled into the <hi>Order</hi> and become a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is brought into a greater subjection and dependence upon them, and stands bound by ties and engagements of being obedient to the Commands of the <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and that not only in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> but in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they shall pretend to be subservient to the exaltation of the <hi>Church,</hi> and for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the glory of the <hi>Triple Crown.</hi> This is a Mystery which few are yet acquainted with, and which both His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> judgd it their interest to have industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously concealed, but whereof the World may ere long receive that convictive intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that there will be no room left for suspecting the truth of it, and whereof a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite</hi> in the late printed <hi>Letter</hi> from <hi>Liege</hi> hath given us already sufficient intimation, both in telling us, <hi>That the King of England stiles himself a Son of the Society,</hi> and how that he wrote to <hi>Father de la Chaise, that he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count every injury done to the Jesuites to be a wrong committed against himself.</hi> Neither is it so surprising as it may seem at first view, that the <hi>King</hi> should list himself a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Order,</hi> seeing there have been <hi>four</hi> other <hi>Crowned Heads</hi> of whose Entrance and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triculation into the <hi>Society,</hi> there is all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and assurance imaginable.

And tho it be too true that many of the <hi>dignified Rank,</hi> as well as of the little <hi>Levites</hi> were both extreamly fond of it, and contentiously pleaded for it; yet it is as true that most of them did it not upon principles of judgment and conscience, but upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements of retaliation for conceived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and upon a belief of its being the most compendious method to the next pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment and benefice, and the fairest way of standing recommended to the favour of the two <hi>Royal Brothers.</hi> Nor is it unworthy of observation, that some of the most viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent writers against liberty of conscience, and others of the most fierce Instigators to the persecuting <hi>Dissenters,</hi> among whom we may reckon <hi>Parker Bishop</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright Bishop</hi> of <hi>Chester,</hi> are since <hi>Adressing</hi> for the <hi>Declaration of Indulgence</hi> became the means of being gracioully lookt upon at <hi>Whitthall,</hi> turned foreward promoters of it, tho their success in their <hi>Diocesses</hi> with their Clergy hath not answered their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations and endeavoures.

most certain that they <hi>two</hi> as well as the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> have promised to turn <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks;</hi> and that as <hi>Crew</hi> hath been several times seen assisting at the celebration of the <hi>Mass,</hi> and that as <hi>Cartwright</hi> payd a particular respect to the <hi>Nuncio</hi> at his solemn Entrance at <hi>Windsor,</hi> which some <hi>Temporal Lords</hi> had so much conscience and honor as to scorn to do, so the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>leige Letter</hi> tells us that <hi>Parker</hi> not only extreamly favours <hi>Popery,</hi> but that he brands in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all such for <hi>Atheists</hi> who continue to plead for the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion. 'Tis an Act of the same candor and good nature in the <hi>King</hi> with the former, and another Royal effect of his <hi>Princely breeding</hi> as well as of his <hi>Gratitude,</hi> when he endeavours to cast a farther <hi>odium</hi> upon the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to exasperate the <hi>Dissenters</hi> against her, by saying in the forementioned <hi>letter</hi> to <hi>Mr. Alsop that the reason why the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters enjoyed not liberty sooner, is wholly owing to the sollicitation</hi> of the Conforming Clergy; whereas many of the learned and sober men of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> could have been contented that the <hi>Nonconforming Protestants</hi> should have had liberty long ago, provided it had been granted in a <hi>legal</hi> way; and the chief executioners of severity upon them were such of all ranks, orders, and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as the <hi>Court</hi> both set on and rewarded for it. 'Tis not their Brethrens having liberty that displeaseth modest &amp; good men of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> but 'tis the having it in the virtu' of an <hi>usurped pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> over the Laws of the Land, and to the shaking all the <hi>legal</hi> foundations of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion it self in the Kingdom.

And as the imposing an <hi>Oath</hi> not warranted by <hi>Law</hi> is a high <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power,</hi> and in the <hi>King</hi> an <hi>altering</hi> of the <hi>Constitution;</hi> so if we look into the <hi>Oath</hi> it self, we shall find this <hi>Absolute Power</hi> strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifested and displayed in all the parts and branches of it, and the people required to swear themselves his <hi>Majesties</hi> most obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient <hi>Slaves</hi> and <hi>Vassalls.</hi> By one <hi>Paragraph</hi> of it, they are required to <hi>swear that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for Subjects on any pretence or for any Cause whatsoever to rise in Arms against him, or any Commissioned by him; and that they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver resist his power or Authority;</hi> which as it may be intended for a foundation and means of keeping men quiet when he shall break in upon their <hi>Estates</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their <hi>Religion,</hi> so it may be designed as an encouragement to his <hi>Catholick Subjects,</hi> to set upon the cutting <hi>Protestants throats,</hi> when by this <hi>Oath</hi> their hands are tied up from hindring them.

For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our <hi>divisions,</hi> are not only kept up at a time, when the united Councels and strength of all <hi>Protestants</hi> is too little against the craft and power of <hi>Rome;</hi> but they who have <hi>Addressed</hi> to thank the <hi>King</hi> for his <hi>Royal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> are become a listed and enrolled <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> to abet and stand by the <hi>King</hi> in all that naturally follows to be done for the maintaining his <hi>Declaration,</hi> and justifying of the usurped <hi>Authority</hi> from which it is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues.

Surely it would have been not only more <hi>generous,</hi> but much more <hi>Christian,</hi> and becoming good as well as wise men, to have made no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliations but those of forgiveness and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the injuries they had met with, and to have offered all the assistances, they could give, to their <hi>conformable Brethren,</hi> for the stemming and withstanding the <hi>deluge</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> and Tyranny that is impetuously breaking in upon the <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> And as this would have united all <hi>Protestants</hi> in bonds of forbearance and love not to be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thro petty differences about <hi>Discipline, Forms</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> and a few <hi>Rites,</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;</hi> so it would in the sense and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all men, have given them a more triumphant victory over those that had been their imprudent and peevish Enemies, than if they were to enjoy the spoiles of the <hi>conformable Clergy,</hi> by being put into posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their <hi>Cures</hi> and <hi>Benefices.</hi> The Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have stood in to the <hi>Dissenting</hi> party, and the Kindness I retain for them above all other, make me heartily bewail, their lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the happiest opportunity, that was ever put into their hands, not only of improving the compassion, which their calamities had raised for them in the hearts of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, into friendship and kindness, but of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring such a <hi>merit</hi> upon the <hi>Nation,</hi> that the utmost favoures which a true <hi>English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Parliament</hi> could hereafter have shewed them, would have been accounted but slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as wel as just Recompences.

And instead of expecting nothing from him, but what may become a brave and generous Enemy, they ought to remember the encouragement that he gave heretofore to two varlets, to burn that part of their <hi>Fleet</hi> which belong'd to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> an action as ignominious as fraudulent, and that might have been fatal to all the <hi>Provinces,</hi> if thro a happy and seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable detection and the apprehension of one of the miscreants, it had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. He knows that the <hi>States General</hi> are not only zealous assertors of the <hi>prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion,</hi> but alway's ready to afford a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and a place of <hi>Refuge</hi> to those, who being oppressed for the profession of it else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, are forced to forsake their own <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> and to seek for shelter and relief in other parts. And as he is not unsensible, how easie the withdrawment and flight is into these <hi>Provinces,</hi> for such as are persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his <hi>Dominions;</hi> so he is aware, that if multitudes, and especially men of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Estates, should for the avoiding his cruelty betake themselves thither, that they would not be unthoughtful of all ways and means, whereby they might Redeem their <hi>Country</hi> from <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and restore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the quiet enjoyment of their <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>liberties</hi> at home. But that which most enrages him is the <hi>Figure</hi> which the two <hi>Princes</hi> do make in that <hi>State</hi> (of whose <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi> the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>Brittain</hi> have so near a prospect) and the <hi>Post</hi> which the <hi>Prince</hi> filleth in that Government, so that he dare neither venture to <hi>difinherit Them,</hi> nor impose upon, them such <hi>Terms,</hi> and <hi>Conditions,</hi> as their Consciences will not suffer them to comply with, while either these <hi>States</hi> remain Free, or while such <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> and <hi>Scotts</hi> as retain a zeal for <hi>Religion</hi> and the ancient <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective <hi>Countries,</hi> can retreat thither under hopes of Admission and Protection. And so closely are the <hi>interests</hi> of all <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> woven and inlaid with the <hi>interest</hi> of the <hi>united Netherlands,</hi> and such is the singular regard that both the one and the other bear to the <hi>Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> and their several <hi>Civil Rights;</hi> that it is impossible for his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> to embarque in a design against the <hi>One,</hi> without resolving at the same time upon the ruin of the <hi>Other.</hi> Neither will the <hi>One</hi> be able to subsist, when once the <hi>Other</hi> is subdu'd and enslaved. As <hi>Philip</hi> the II. of <hi>Spain,</hi> saw no way so compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for the restoring himself to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and Tyrannous Rule over the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as the subjugating of <hi>England</hi> that hel'p to support and assist them, which was the ground of rigging out his formidable <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and of his design against <hi>England</hi> in 1588. so his <hi>Brittish Majesty,</hi> thinks no method so expeditious for the enslaving his own <hi>People,</hi> as the endeavouring first to subdue the <hi>Dutch.</hi> And as upon the one hand it would be of a threatning consequence to <hi>Holland,</hi> could the <hi>King</hi> subjugate his own <hi>People,</hi> extirpate the <hi>protestant Religion</hi> out of his <hi>Dominions,</hi> and advance himself to a <hi>Despotical Power;</hi> so upon the other hand, could he conquer

They are like the <hi>Twins</hi> we read of, whose <hi>Destiny</hi> was to live and die together; and which soever of the <hi>two</hi> is destroyed first, all the hope and comfort that the <hi>other</hi> can pretend unto, is to be last devoured. Now after the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which his <hi>Majesty</hi> hath made towards the enslaving his <hi>Subjects,</hi> and the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in his <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> he finds it necessary before he venture to give the last and fatal stroke at home, and to enter upon the plenary exercise of his <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power,</hi> in laying <hi>Parliaments</hi> wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, in cancelling all <hi>Laws</hi> to make way for <hi>Royal Edicts</hi> or <hi>Declarations</hi> of the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of the former, and in commanding us to turn <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> or to be <hi>dragoon'd;</hi> I say he thinks it needful before he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to these, to try whether he can subdue and conquer the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and thereby remove all hopes of shelter, relief, comfort, and assistance from his own <hi>People,</hi> when he shall afterwards fall upon them.

Now as it will be at this juncture, when the <hi>Protestant Interest</hi> is so low in the World, and the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in so great danger of being destroyed, a most wicked as well as an imprudent Act, to contribute help and aid to the subjugating a people, that are the chief <hi>Protectors</hi> of the <hi>protestant Religion</hi> that are left, and almost the only <hi>Asserters</hi> of the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>liberties</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> so it may, fill the <hi>Addressers</hi> with confusion and shame that they should have not only justified an Act of his <hi>Majestys</hi> that is plainly designed to such a mischievous End, but that they should by the promises and vows that they have made him, have emboldned his <hi>Majesty</hi> to continue his purposes and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of a war against the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Which as it must be funestous and fatal to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Cause,</hi> in case he should prosper and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; so howsoever it should issue, yet the <hi>Addressers,</hi> who have done what in them lyes to give encouragement unto it, will be held <hi>betrayers</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> both abroad and at home, and judged guilty of all the blood of those of the same Faith with them, that shall be shed in this Quarrel.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Liberty</hi> ought to be allowed to men in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> is no <hi>Plea</hi> whereby the <hi>Kings</hi> giving it in an <hi>illegal</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> manner, can be maintained and justified. Since ever I was capable of Exercising any distinct and coherent Acts of Reason, I have been alway's of that Mind, that none ought to be persecuted for their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards God in matters of Faith and Worship. Nor is it one of those things that lye under the power of the <hi>Soveraign</hi> and <hi>Legislative Authority,</hi> to grant or not to grant; but it is a Right setled upon mankind ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to all <hi>Civil Constitutions</hi> and <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> having its foundation in the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> which no <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State</hi> can legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately violate and infringe. The <hi>Magistrate</hi> as a <hi>Civil Officer</hi> can pretend or claim no power over a people, but what he either derives from the <hi>Divine Charter,</hi> wherein <hi>God,</hi> the Supream <hi>Instituter</hi> of <hi>Magistracy</hi> has chalk't out the duty of <hi>Rulers</hi> in general, or what the people upon the first and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Stipulation,</hi> are supposed to have given him in order to the protection, peace and prosperity of the <hi>Society.</hi> But as it does no where appear that <hi>God</hi> hath given any such power to <hi>Governors,</hi> seeing all the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Scripture, as well as all the Dictates of Nature, speak a contrary lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, so neither can the People upon their chusing such a <hi>one</hi> to be their <hi>Ruler,</hi> be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29511:21"/>
to <hi>transferr</hi> and <hi>vest</hi> such a <hi>power</hi> in <hi>him,</hi> for as much as they cannot divest themselves of a <hi>power,</hi> no more than of a <hi>Right,</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving things, as they arrive with a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility to their several and respective Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings. As it is in no mans power to believe as he will, but only as he sees cause; so it is the most irrational imagination in the world, to think they should transferr a <hi>Right</hi> to him whom they have chosen to <hi>Govern</hi> them, of punishing them for what it is not in their power to help. Nor can any thing be plainer, than that <hi>God</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the <hi>Empire</hi> over <hi>Conscience</hi> to <hi>himself,</hi> and that he hath circumscribed the <hi>power</hi> of all humane <hi>Governore</hi> to things of a <hi>civil</hi> and inferior nature. And had <hi>God</hi> convey'd a <hi>Right</hi> unto <hi>Magistrates</hi> of commanding men to be of this or that <hi>Religion,</hi> and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are so, and will have others to be of their mind; it would follow that the People may conform to whatsoever they require, tho by all the lights of sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Revelation, they are convinced of the falsehood of it: seeing whatsoever the <hi>Soveraign rightfully Commands,</hi> the <hi>Subjects</hi> may <hi>lawfully obey.</hi> But tho the persecuting people <hi>for matters of meer Religion,</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the light of Nature, inconsistent with the fundamental Maximes of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, directly contrary to the temper and genious, as well as to the Rules of the Gospel, and not only against the safety and interest of <hi>Civil Societies,</hi> but of a tendency to fill them with confusion, and to arm Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the cutting of one anothers throats; yet <hi>Governors</hi> may both <hi>deny Liberty</hi> to those whose <hi>principles</hi> oblige them to <hi>destroy</hi> those that are not of their mind, and may in some measure <hi>Regulate</hi> the Liberty which they vouch save to others, whose opinions tho they do not think dangerous to the peace of the <hi>Community,</hi> yet thro judging them er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and false, they conceive them dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Soules of men.
