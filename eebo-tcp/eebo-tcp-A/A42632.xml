            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>FROM THE
ARCH-BISHOP
OF THE
Iſle of Samos in Greece.</head>
            <head type="sub">An Account of his building the Grecian Church in So-hoe
Feilds, and the diſpoſal thereof by the Maſters of the Pariſh of St. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins
in the Feilds.</head>
            <p>IN the Year 1676 I came into <hi>England</hi> with intentions to publiſh a Book in
print called <hi>Anthologion,</hi> for the uſe of the Eaſtern Greek Church, but finding they
had no place allotted for the Exerciſe of our Religion, but that ſome Perſons
of our Country, <hi>Daniel Bulgaris</hi> a Prieſt, and others, who had earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to get one builded, and in order thereunto had obtained his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
gracious Grant for the ſame, two years before my arrival; but wanting means,
methods, and intereſt to proceed to the accompliſhing this their purpoſe, they deſired
me to take the buſineſs upon me; in which, though ſome difficulties appeared unſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to my Function; yet in Piety to the Church, and to promote the exerciſe of the
Divine Service thereof, I undertook the charge, and proceeded therein, as followeth
<hi>Viz.</hi> I firſt applyed my ſelf to the Right Reverend the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him therewith, and his Lordſhip did ſo far approve thereof, that he promiſed to
ſpeak to the other Biſhops, and other Gentlemen to beſtow their benevolent Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
towards the building the ſaid Church: Next I applyed my ſelf to Doctor <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi>
who was then concerned in building in <hi>So-hoe</hi> Feilds. He as ſoon as he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with my deſign, promiſed to give me a peice of ground, and to build the
Foundation at his own charge; thereupon <hi>I</hi> went again to his ſaid Lordſhip, and telling
him thereof, he promiſed to give me a peice of ground himſelf, and ſent one Mr. <hi>Thrift</hi>
with me, and marked out the ground.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I went to his Majeſty, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and moſt of the Nobility and
Clergy, who were pleaſed to contribute freely to the Building, there being gathered
both in City and Country fifteen hundred pounds. I began the foundation at my
own charge, and as I received the Contributions I went on; and expended therein, as
may appear by the Workmens Receipts, eight hundred pounds; and the remainder of
the mony was expended in Charges, Servants wages, and Horſe hire in going about the
Country, and in my maintenance for theſe ſix years laſt paſt.</p>
            <p>After ſome time the Church being found inconveniently ſituated, being too remote
from the abodes of moſt of the Grecians, (dwelling cheifly in the furthermoſt parts of
the City,) it was upon mature conſideration thought fit to be ſold, another to be build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a more convenient place; whereupon <hi>I</hi> applyed my ſelf again to his Lordſhip the
Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who was pleaſed to tell me, that when the ſaid Church was ſold, his
Lordſhip would give his Grant and Title for the building of another.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>I</hi> indeavoured to ſell it, and finding two perſons that would buy the ſame,
the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> would not conſent thereto, leſt the Party ſhould make a
Meeting Houſe thereof. Hereupon <hi>I</hi> went to the Doctor of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> who propoſing
it to the Pariſh, they conſented before the ſaid Lord Biſhop, to let it be apprais'd by
two able Workmen: The Church was accordingly veiwed, and rated to be worth
626 <hi>l.</hi> The Pariſh proffered 168 <hi>l.</hi> alledging that the ground was theirs, and not the
Biſhops: This agreement falling off, <hi>I</hi> found out others, who proffered 62 <hi>l.</hi> more than
the Pariſh had done, which they of the Pariſh coming to underſtand, they proffered
200 <hi>l.</hi> which <hi>I</hi> refuſing to take, the Lord Biſhop required me to give them the Key,
which I denying to do, they told me they would take the Church without it, as they
did accordingly, breaking open the dore, and taking poſſeſſion: Hereupon <hi>I</hi> indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to carry the perſon who broke open the door before a Juſtice, that <hi>I</hi> might ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
my ſelf, but the Pariſh no<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> permitting him to go, I went my ſelf, but not finding
the Juſtice I deſiſted from any further proceeding.</p>
            <p>This Relation <hi>I</hi> have thought fit to make, that thereby all Perſons may ſee, <hi>I</hi> never
