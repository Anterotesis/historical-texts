            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A crime then it is, and that most incident to Princes, it too often falling out that <hi>potentiae incrementum sceleris occasio majoris,</hi> the greatnesse of their power seems to warrant the vastnesse of their desires: Two instances among others are most remarkable; the one in sacred, the other in prophane story,

Indeed that Proverb of the Sea is too often verified of great men, that they are ill neighbours, their covetous desires being aptly resembled by Saint <hi>Basil</hi> to fire which burns from house to house, and Wood to Wood, while there is any materials to feed it.</p>

            <p n="1">1 The bound is <hi>Segregans</hi> distinguishing between <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> one mans possession from another; so do wholsome Laws civill Nations from Barbarians; by them were the Jews severed from all the people of the World.

            <p>You have viewed the bound, now see the fault of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in reference to this bound, for which I shall make use of a double translation.</p>
            <p>First, some read it <hi>transferentes</hi> or <hi>moventes terminum,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our English translation, they did remove or take away the Bound, and thus the crime reproved is <hi>socordia prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oipum,</hi> the Princes extreame sluggishnesse in not administring justice and maintayning Gods worship according to his laws,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>And surely the accusation of the Princes for this as an iniquity, is a plain intimation of the contrary, as a duty, that they ought not only (which few deny) to uphold Civill Laws but (which many in this scepticall age impugne) to command Gods Worship. It is the command given to all <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Iudges of the earth, serve the Lord in fear, Psal.</hi> 2.11. upon which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> well observes <hi>aliter servit qua homo, aliter quarex,</hi> A Magistrate must serve God, not only as a

a man, but as a Ruler; and when is that, but as the same Father excellently, <hi>cum bona jubeat, mala prohibeat, non solÃ¹m quae pertinent ad humanam societatem, verÃ¹m etiam quae ad huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam religionem?</hi> When they both command those goods things, and forbid the evils which appertain as well to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship, as to humane society. Among those many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which <hi>Plato</hi> conceives belonging to Magistrates, hee mentions this as the chief; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, to take care of Gods service.

It is prophesied of the Church of the New Testament, that <hi>Kings should be their nursing fathers, and Queens their nursing mothers, Isa.</hi> 49.23. Sure then the child of Religion is intrusted to their charge. That which S. <hi>Paul</hi> requires to be the end of the peoples prayer for the Magistrate, ought doubtlesse to be the end of the Magistrates care for the people, namely, <hi>That we may lead a peaceable and quiet life in all godlines &amp; honesty,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. I grant, as Law is the bound of a Commonwealth, so right Reason is the limit of Law; and as Religion is the bound of a Church, so Scriptures are the limit of Religion, beyond which nothing ought to be required as essentiall and necessary: yet this hindereth not but that Magistrates through their own industry, and the advice of learned <hi>Councels</hi> or <hi>Synods,</hi> ought to find out and establish that Religion which is most consonant to sacred Writ. It is true, mens consciences cannot be compelled to embrace the faith professed; no more can their hearts, to the love of morall vertues: yet in regard of outward conformity, they may and ought to be enjoyned the frequenting of Gods publike Worship and Ordinances, the means of both. It is better to be <hi>compelled to a Feast,</hi>

execute Gods judgement; since though they act his secret will, they contradict his revealed will, the only rule of our actions: the truth is, they perform his will against their will, their ayme being to fulfill their own lusts, not his pleasure. So God himself sayth of the Assyrian,<note place="margin">Isa. 10.7.</note> 
               <hi>He meaneth not so, neither doth his heart thinke</hi> and therefore resolveth <hi>after hee hath performed his whole work upon mount Sion and Jerusalem,</hi>

               <hi>to punish the fruits of the stout heart of the King of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</hi> The just reward of unjust oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours.</p>
            <p>Finally, whatever injuries are brought upon us by man, let us acknowledge them as deserved punishment of our sin, in regard of God. Though we have given no cause to the one, and so are innocent, yet we have given just cause to the other, and so are nocent; and therefore as the <hi>Athenians,</hi> when an Oxe was killed for sacrifice, condemned the sword, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted the Priest; so let us, whilest we accuse the cruelty of our enemies who are the instruments, excuse the severity of God who is the efficient of all those evils (as they are punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) which fall upon us; ever saying with <hi>Mauritius, justa, Domine, judiciatua,</hi> Thy judgements (O Lord) are just and righteous altogether.</p>
