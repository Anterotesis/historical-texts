            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For whereas in the former exposition it was said, <hi>hee visited,</hi> that is, redeemed his people as hee had graciously promised; here it is said, hee visited, that is redeemed or saved us, that he might performe his promise. Where the keeping of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is made the end of his sending Christ to redeeme us: to let us understand, that as God was most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in promising our redemption, so most faithfull and just in the performance. So that the former part of this Psalme, from the beginning thereof to the end of my Text, is but one sentence or Axiome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is relation of consequence; the summe whereof is this: Because the Lord hath visited, that is, hath redeemed his people, according to his promise, &amp; hath saved us, that hee might keepe his promise, and performe his oath, hee is therefore to bee <hi>blessed,</hi> that is, magnified and praised.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10660:7"/>
this manner: The Lord God of Israel is therefore to be blessed, because hee hath visited, that is, hath sent his Sonne to redeeme us, as hee had promised; and to save us, that hee might keepe his promise, &amp; performe his oath, which hee sware to <hi>Abraham,</hi> The tenour whereof was this, <hi>that hee would give us, &amp;c.</hi> And this is the coherence of my text. Out of which wee may gather these three observations.</p>
                  <p>First, where it is said, that God did therefore send his Sonne to redeeme us, that hee might keepe his promise, and performe his oath; wee observe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable truth and fidelitie of God in performing his promises; <hi>For in Christ</hi> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">2. <hi>Corint.</hi> 1.20.</note> 
                     <hi>all the promises of God are yea, and amen.</hi> If therefore the truth of God be such, that rather then hee would goe backe from his word, hee did send his owne Sonne to suffer death for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: Yea, if his fidelitie were such, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he sent his sonne that hee might performe his promise, then can we not doubt of the performance of any other promise of God; this being the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult of all, either for God to graunt, or for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. When the world was to bee made, the Lord did speake the word, and it was created. But when it was to be redeemed; hee gave his Sonne to be a price of ransome for us. And who would euer have thought (but that the Lord hath revealed this his unspeakable mercie in his word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) that God, being of infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie and glory, and enjoying all selfe-contented hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, would give his onely begotten Sonne to die for his enemies. If therefore to make good this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, hee gave his sonne to die for us, how shall hee <note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</note> not with him give us all other good things which hee hath promised? Such is the truth of God, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10660:7"/>
every faithfull man may say with the Apostle, <note n="h" place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12.</note> 
                     <hi>I know whom I haue beleeved, and I am sure</hi> that what he hath promised shall in due time be performed. For as he is omnipotent, and therefore able, so he is the God <note n="a" place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> nor deny <note n="e" place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15.</note> himselfe. Wherefore, as the faithfull; who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before the incarnation of CHRIST, did faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and comfortably waite for the performance of that promise, as being the consolation <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, whereas <hi>Zachary</hi> praiseth the Lord for performing his promise concerning our redemption by CHRIST, wee learne, what is our dutie; namely to praise and magnifie the name of the Lord, as for all other his mercies, so especially for the worke of our redemption; according to that. Psalm. 107.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Let them praise the Lord, whom hee hath redeemed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the hand of the enemie.</hi> But of this more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas <hi>Zachary</hi> giveth thankes to God for a benefit not as yet received; for as yet CHRIST was not borne, and much lesse had he as yet redeemed us; Wee learne, that wee are to give thankes, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the benefits already received, but for such also as are promised. For this is a notable fruite of a lively
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10660:8"/>
faith, setting forth also most notably the truth of God in his promises; when a man in the assurance of faith, which is <note n="g" place="margin">

                     </gap>se benefites and blessings, which as yet he hath not, as though he had already received them. It is the commendation of the faithfull, Heb. 11.13. <hi>Who having not received the promises, but having seene them a farre off</hi> (as <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                     <note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.56.</note> saw the day of Christ) beleeved them, embraced them, and rejoyced in them. For if he, who prayseth God for benefites recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <note n="i" place="margin">

Thus <hi>David</hi> shewed himselfe thankefull to God for the favours which hee had promised by <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2. Sam. 7. and thus ought wee to be thankefull for the promises of a better life.

                  <p>Concerning the partie which did sweare,<note place="margin">The party who did sweare.</note> we are to consider these three things. 1. By whom hee sware. 2. How, or after what manner. 3. To what end. For the first; it is the manner of men in their oathes to sweare by a greater. But the Lord, when he made this Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> because he could not sweare by a greater, hee sware by himselfe, Heb. 6.13. <hi>By my selfe have I sworne, saith the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Genes. 22.16.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the manner: we may gather by that, which the Lord requireth in our oathes, what hee performed in his owne, Ierem. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.2. There are three
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10660:9"/>
properties required in an Oath, <hi>Truth, Iudgement,</hi> and <hi>Righteousnes. Truth,</hi> opposed to falshood or perjury: <hi>Iudgement,</hi> to rash and common swearing; <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> to vnjust and vnlawfull Oathes.</p>
                  <p>For the first: that the Lord did sweare in <hi>truth,</hi> it is most certaine; because it is impossible, that the Lord in his promise, and in his oath should lye, Heb. 6.18. and therefore wee may be assured of that, wherewith <note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Micah.</hi> 7.20</note> 
                     <hi>Micah</hi> concludeth his prophecy, that the Lord will undoubtedly performe his mercy, which by oath he promised to <hi>Abraham.</hi> From whence we may learne this most profitable instruction. That seeing the oath of the Lord, whereby hee promiseth to give to all them that are delivered from the hand of their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall enemies (that is to all that are redeemed by CHRIST) grace to worship him in holynes &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, is infallible, wee should therefore bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to bring forth these fruites of our redemption; otherwise, wee can have no assurance, that we are the redeemed of the LORD. Yea, on the contrary, it may bee verified of us; that if wee doe live in sinne, and doe not, at the least, desire and endeavour to serve God in the duties of holynes and righteousnes: it is as certaine as the Oath of God is true, that as yet wee have no part in the redemption wrought by CHRIST. And the reason hereof is evident, for to bee a servant of sinne, and to bee redeemed from the bondage of sinne; are things repugnant, and imply a contradiction. For whom <hi>Christ the Sonne of God maketh free they are free indeed.</hi> Iohn. 8.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. But hee, that is a servant of sinne, is not freed indeed. Now every one that committeth sinne, as habituated in sinne, that is, in whom sinne raigneth,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10660:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hee is the servant both of sinne, Ioh. 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, in <hi>Iudgement,</hi> a man is said to sweare in judgement, when hee sweareth advisedly, upon just and necessary occasion. For oathes are then onely good, when they are necessary. This necessity of the Lords oath ariseth from our weakenes and infidelitie, who will not beleeve the Lord without an oath. And therefore the Lord, in great mercy to relieve our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, hath confirmed his promise, which in it selfe needeth no confirmation, as being truth it selfe <gap reason="foreign">

It is great infidelitie, not to beleeve the word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God; but greater, not to beleeve his oath. In not beleeving his promise, thou makest him a lyar. 1.

And yet this is the estate and condition of many professing the name of Christ, God hath sworne, and will not repent, that to those, whom he redeemeth, grace shall be given to worshippe him in holynes and righteousnes. These men do not so much as desire, care or endevour to worshippe God in holynes and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes; but live in sinne, and goe on in sinne, without repentance: and yet for all this, they will needes perswade themselves, that they are the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Lord, contrary to the expresse Oath of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in <hi>Righteousnes:</hi> Men are said to sweare in righteousnes, when that, which they promise by Oath, is lawfull and good. And this goodnes is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10660:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
measured by the reference which it hath to the glorie of God, and good of man. Neither doth the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Oath want this propertie. For what could be either more glorious to himselfe, or more profitable unto us; then that which by this Oath is promised? For as touching the glory of God: among all the works, which God ever wrought, there is not any that setteth forth more the glory both of his mercy and of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, then the worke of our redemption with the fruits thereof. For hereby appeareth his mercy to be such, as that rather then he would suffer us most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sinners to perish in our sinnes, he gave his owne, and his onely begotten Sonne to die for us. His ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice such, that rather then hee would suffer the sinnes of his owne elect children to goe unpunished, he hath punished them in the death and sufferings of his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Sonne.</p>
                  <p>And if you consider our profit, it is evident that (as hereafter you shall heare) in the things promised by this Oath, our happines doth consist. Neither doubt I to affirme, that by the things promised in this oath, our estate becommeth better, then that which wee lost in <hi>Adam. Adam,</hi> though hee were just, stood righteous before God, but in his owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; but we being redeemed by CHRIST, stand righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God in the righteousnes of CHRIST, which farre surpasseth the righteousnes both of men and Angels. <hi>Adam</hi> was created good, but changeable, and therefore, being tempted, he fell; but wee, being once redeemed by CHRIST and sanctified by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, shall never fall away; but <note n="l" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</note>

paradise but the happines, which CHRIST hath purchased for us, is in Heaven. Thus much of the manner.</p>
                  <p>Now are wee to consider the end for which the Lord did sweare: which is plainly and fully set downe Hebr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.17.18 that he might more abundantly shew unto the heyres of promise, <hi>the stablenes of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: that by two immutable things</hi> (that is his word, and his Oath) <hi>they might have strong consolation.</hi> For howsoever they might doubt of their perseverance unto salvation, in regard both of their owne frailtie, and also of the strength of their enemies: yet they know, that the foundation of God abideth sure, 2. Tim. 2.19. and that the word and oath of the Lord is immutable; and that, howsoever heaven and earth shall passe away; yet not one jote, or title of the oath of God shall fall to the ground. And therefore have just cause with <hi>David,</hi> Psalme 40.2. to professe their confidence, and with <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 8.38.39. to rest assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that nothing shalbe able to separate them from Gods love in CHRIST IESVS our Lord. For the Lord hath sworne, and will not repent, that <hi>he will give us, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, to worshippe him without feare, in holines, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, before him, all the dayes of our life.</hi> If therefore the oath of an honest man be, or ought to bee <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>nto us of doubting and distrust?</p>
                  <p>The use, which we are to make of that, which hath beene said, concerning the Lord his taking of an Oath; is that, whereunto wee are so often exhorted in the Scriptures, <hi>Be you holy, as I am holy, saith the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10660:11"/>
Lord</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, in this particular dutie of holynes (for sweating is required in the first Table) wee are to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Lord, both in respect of the action it selfe, and also in regard of the object, the manner, and the end.</p>
                  <p>As touching the action it selfe, where the Lord is said to have sworne, wee are taught, that to sweare, is in a selfe a thing lawfull and good, though the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists deny it in all Christians, and the Papists in them, who in their conceipt, are perfect; and yet in the Scriptures we see it by the holy Angels, by the blessed Apostle in divers places of his Epistles, in the penning whereof he was free, as from erring, so also from sinning, and lastly by God himselfe, in this, and many other places. Neither is it onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as lawfull, and good, as Psalm. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.11. but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so commanded as necessary, and as a thing which not onely may be done, but also which must be done, Deut. 6.13.10.20. as being a dutie both of holynes to God, and of righteousnes and charitie to man. For being rightly performed, it serveth greatly to set forth the glory of God, by ascribing unto him omniscience and omnipresence, the knowledge of secrets, justice, the patronage of truth, the punishing of falshood. Of charity and righteousnes to men, as being profitable and necessary for the manifestation of a necessary truth, for appeasing controversies among men, for the discharge of our duety, &amp; sometimes for clearing our owne innocencie. And therefore being a duety so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in respect both of God and man; God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath sworne it should be practised in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, Es. 45.23. But I shall not neede to prove the lawfulnes of swearing in these times, when there are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10660:11"/>
more that sweare, <note n="l" place="margin">

                     <hi>then that doe feare an Oath.</hi> Let us rather consider, how wee are to imitate the Lord in swearing, in respect of the object, the manner, and the end.</p>
                  <p>First therefore, as the Lord did sweare by the true God onely, that is, himselfe: so wee are to sweare by no other, for what wee sweare by, that wee Deifie; and therefore to sweare by any other, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o forsake God Ierem. 5.7.</p>
                  <p>And as touching the manner, wee are to sweare in truth, in judgement, and in righteousnes, Ierem. 4.2. for not to sweare in truth is perjury; which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, condemned, and punished as a detestable sinne, and as an horrible profanation of the name of God. Lev. 19.12. Ierem. 5.2. Zach. 5.4. wherein besides fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and lying, which destroy the soule, and exclude out of heaven, Apoc. 22.15. and besides deceipt, (and that under the religion of an Oath,) whereof God is the avenger, 1. Thes. 4.6. Ps. 5.7. there do also concurre two other abominations. The one an horrible indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offered to the Majestie of God, whereby as if he were a patron of falshood, they call upon him, as a witnesse, to second their untruth. The other in that they tempt God, and date him, as it were, to his face, to execute his vengeance upon them, if they avouch an untruth; when they themselves know, that they sweare falsly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in <hi>judgement:</hi> for to sweare rashly and commonly in our ordinary talke, is to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that is, to pollute the holy name of GOD; and to turne the Sanctuary of verity, into a common house of vanity. As the Name of GOD is holy and and reverend, so ought it to be used holily, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendly;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10660:12"/>
And as an Oath is not simply good, but upon necessitie; so ought it not to be used, but when it is necessary. For <hi>bonum necessarium extra terminos ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitatis non est bonum.</hi> Our Saviour therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth us to sweare at all in our ordinary talke, Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iames wisheth us above all things to take heed, that wee sweare not, lest wee fall into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, Iam. 5.12. and wholesome to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is the counsell of the Sonne of <hi>Syrach,</hi> Eccl. 23.9.10.11.12.13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in <hi>Righteousnes</hi>: for by oath to promise that, which is unlawfull, besides that it argueth a full purpose, and resolution to doe evill, which is to sinne with a high hand: it doth also offer an horrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie unto God, when a man calleth upon him to be, as it were his suretie for the doing of that evill, which he promiseth.</p>
                  <p>There remaineth the end: for so wee are to sweare, that by testifying a necessary truth, which cannot by other meanes be manifested; God may be glorified (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that forme of adjuration, <hi>Give glory to God,</hi> Ios. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Vaine are the Oathes, which are not referred to these, or such like ends; and by them also the holy name of GOD is taken in vaine. So usually doe they sweare, that sweare usually; having no respect, either to the glory of God, the good of their brethren, or discharge of their dutie; but rap out Oathes, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in choler, sometimes in pride and vaine-glorie, sometimes in deceipt, to colour their falshood: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a vaine conceipt to winne credit to their speeches wherein notwithstanding they are miserably

deceived, for he that sweareth much, sometimes for-sweareth: and he that maketh no conscience of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting the holy and dreadfull name of GOD by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon swearing; will learne to make no conscience of swearing falsly. So much of the partie that did sweare.</p>
                  <p>Now we are to speake of the partie to whom this Oath was made: who is here described by his name <hi>Abraham,</hi> and by his relation to us, <hi>Our Father. Abraham</hi> was so called by GOD himselfe, Genes. 17. because he made him <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, whereas I shewed before, that the Lord would not have taken an Oath, unlesse it had beene necessary, in respect of our weakenes and increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who will not beleeve him without an Oath: It appeareth, that <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe needed to have the promises of God confirmed to him by Oath: From whence we learne this profitable lesson, that the faith of the best of us hath its imperfections, and is mingled with unbeliefe. For if <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the faithfull, the most worthy patterne of a lively and a strong faith, had need to have his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities relieved, as it is plaine that he had: not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as in this place) by an Oath, but also Genes. 15. by a signe Genes. 17. by the Sacrament of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, which was unto him a seale of that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which is by faith: and almost in every Chapter of his story, by the often repeating and renewing of the promises unto him:<note place="margin">

life; &amp; also of the carelesse practise of others, who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king they have proceeded farre enough, sitt still, not seeking to goe forward in the way of Christianity; and therefore are not likely to come to the end of their way, which is the salvation of their soules. But we, in the humble acknowledgement of our imperfections, must with the Apostles, Luk. 17.5. pray unto the Lord to <hi>encrease our faith,</hi> and using all good meanes, to proceed <hi>from faith to faith,</hi> untill we come to a perfect man in CHRIST, we must with the Apostle, as not having attained, Phil. 3.12.13. <hi>forget those things which are behinde, and reach forth to those things which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, pressing forward towards the marke for the prize of the high calling of God in</hi> CHRIST, Phil. 3.14. and if the Apostle, and those who are perfect, that is, <hi>adulti,</hi> growne men in CHRIST, are to be of this minde, as the Apostle saith in the next verse: much more those, which are not so good proficients, ought to be so min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, remembring that religion is compared to a way, wherein we are still to goe on, untill we come to the end of our way, which will not be before the end of our life.</p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>Zachary</hi> calleth <hi>Abraham our father,</hi> this is not to be understood, either of all the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or of the <hi>Iewes</hi> alone, but of all the faithfull, whether they be <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi> For <hi>Abraham</hi> is the father of all the faithfull, Rom. 4.11. and all, which are of the faith, are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Galat. 3.7. In this sense, <hi>Zacheus</hi> the Publicane receiving our Saviour by faith, became the sonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Luk. 19.9. As for those, who were of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, according to the flesh, and not according to his faith, they are not accompted the seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For as the Apostle
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10660:13"/>
saith, Rom. 9.6.7. <hi>All they are not Israell, which are of Israell, neither are they all children, because they are the seed of Abraham, but in Isaak shall thy seed be called,</hi> that is, saith the Apostle, vers. 8. <hi>they, which are the children of the flesh, are not the children of God, but the children of the promise are accompted for the seed.</hi> So our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, Ioh. 8. although he graunt, that the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to whom he spake, were, according to the flesh, the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> vers. 37. Yet he concludeth against them, that they were not <hi>Abrahams</hi> sons indeed, because they did not the works of <hi>Abraham</hi> vers. 39.40. This must teach those, who come of faithfull parents, or are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly descended from famous and worthy ancestours, not to rely too much upon their parentage, but to shew themselves to be their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by imitating their faith, and their godly conversation. For otherwise, though their parents were the children of God, they may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding be the Children of the Devill, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour telleth the unbelieving <hi>Iewes,</hi> John. 8.44. And therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> warneth the <hi>Iewes,</hi> not to stand so much upon this, that they had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their father; but willeth them to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance, Matth. 3.9. If therefore we would be able, with <hi>Zachary,</hi> to call <hi>Abraham Our father,</hi> we must follow the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3.7. and imitate his workes, Ioh. 8.39.</p>
                  <p>Againe, from hence we observe; that, what is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this Oath concerning <hi>us</hi> that he would give <hi>us,</hi> that <hi>we</hi> being delivered, &amp;c. is not to be understood of all men, but of <hi>us,</hi> who have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Father, that is to say, of the faithfull, who onely are the sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the heyres of the promise.</p>

CHRIST <hi>hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us, that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through</hi> IESVS CHRIST, <hi>that wee might receive the promise of the spirit.</hi> But most chiefly in this place, where the holy Ghost doth, as it were, <hi>ex professo</hi> expound, what this blessednes is, viz. <hi>that hee would give us, that wee being delivered from the hand of our enemies, should worshippe him without feare in holynes and righteousnes before him all the dayes of our life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, that this is a most true and perfect exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will prove by these two reasons. And first, for the truth of it. For whereas there are two degrees of our happines; the one, begunne in this life, which is called <hi>beatitudo viae</hi>: the other, compleat in the life to come, which is <hi>beatitudo patriae:</hi> that is to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted our happines in this life, whereby, as by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, wee attayne to eternall happines in the world to come. Now the degrees of salvation, which the sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> faithfull, and therefore called, obtaine in this life, are justification, &amp; sanctification; justification, by which we are intituled to the kingdome of heaven, and with it concurre redemption, reconciliation, and adoption, being all in substance the same, differing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in some relation or respect. For when God doth forgive our sinnes by imputation of CHRISTS righteousnes, he doth both redeeme and reconcile, and justifie, and adopt us: but with this distinction. First, that when forgiving our sinnes, by which wee are bound over to death and damnation, and held captives
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10660:16"/>
of sinne and Sathan, he freeth us from this bondage, he is said to <hi>redeeme us,</hi> Ephes. 1.7. Col. 1.14. Secondly, when forgiving our sinnes, whereby we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, and enemies against God, he receiveth us into his love, &amp; favour in CHRIST, he is said to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile</hi> us, 2. Cor. 5.19. Thirdly, when forgiving our sinnes, which exclude us from heaven, &amp; make us guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of damnation, he doth absolve &amp; acquitte us from the guilt, and doth accept of us in CHRIST as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and as heyres of salvation, he is said to <hi>justifie</hi> us, Rom. 3.24.25.4.6.7.8. Fourthly, when forgiving our sinnes, which made us the children of the Devill, he doth in CHRIST take us to be his children, he is said to adopt us. The second degree is sanctification, by which we are prepared and made fitt for Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Now these two are the two partes of the gift, which God by oath in this place promised to give to the faithfull the sonnes of <hi>Abraham; viz.</hi> deliverance from the hand of our spirituall enemies, namely the law, sinne, death, and the devill, which is our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or justification: and grace to worship God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare in holines and righteousnes before him all the daies of our life, which is our sanctification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 And that it is a full &amp; perfect exposition, it is easily proved: because not onely to the whole gift here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, but to every part and parcell thereof happines is ascribed in the word of God. As first, to <hi>redemption</hi>; for what is it to be redeemed by CHRIST, but to have remission of sinnes by him? Ephes. 1.7. Col. 1.14. <hi>By him we have redemption, even the remission of our sinnes.</hi> But to the remission of sinnes the holy Ghost ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth blessednes, Psal. 32. i. 2. Rom. 4.6.7. <hi>Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven, whose sinne is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10660:16"/>
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly to a godly life: which is here termed the worship of God in holines &amp; righteousnes, in which keeping of the law doth consist. For when a woman out of the crowd cryed unto our Saviour, <hi>blessed is the wombe that bare thee, and the pappes that gave thee suck,</hi> Our Saviour returned this answere, Luk. 11.28. <hi>Yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blessed are they that heare the word of God and keepe it.</hi> The same hath <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prov. 29.18. &amp; who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that, which the Apostle teacheth 1. Tim. 4.8. <hi>Godlines hath the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> and consequently of the happines both of this life, and of the other life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 To the parts of Gods worship; as namely to <hi>holines.</hi> Apoc. 20.6. <hi>Blessed and holy is the man, who hath his part in the first resurrection.</hi> Which testimony yeeldeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us a double proofe. First, because he useth the termes of <hi>Blessed</hi> &amp; <hi>holy</hi> promiscuously; implying, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is blessed, is holy; and that whosoever is holy, is blessed. Secondly, because he saith, they are blessed, who have their part in the first resurrection, whereby the soules of the faithfull doe rise from the grave of sinne to holynes of life. And not onely to holynes in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but to the severall branches thereof is blessednes ascribed; as to saving knowledge. Pro. 3.13. Ioh. 17.3. to faith Luk. 1.45.

                  <p>And not onely to the partes of Gods worship, but also to the properties. Fiftly therefore to the worship of God <hi>

Whither you understand it without cause of feare, because there is no condemnation to them that are in CHRIST IESVS, Rom. 8.1. or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out servile feare, in expectation of eternall happines, Tit. 2.13. for this indeede is the toppe of our happines in this life, to worship God, as without feare of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; so in a sownd expectation of eternall life. And this seemeth to be implyed in the Hebrew word <hi>Hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baracu,</hi> which being of a reciprocall signification, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that in <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed all Nations should not onely be blessed, but also should blesse themselves, that is esteeme and accoumpt themselves blessed.</p>

                  <p>Seventhly, To perseverance or worshipping of God <hi>all the daies of our life.</hi> For he that continueth to the end shall be saved, Matth. 10.22. Mark. 13.13.</p>
                  <p>If therefore blessednes be ascribed, first of all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption or deliverance from our enemies; secondly, to the true worship of God in generall, thirdly, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes, fourthly, to righteousnes, fiftly, to the worship of God without feare, sixtly, to integritie, or to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10660:17"/>

                  <p>By this conference of places wee learne, what the happines of a Christian is in this life; not to abound in wealth, not to attaine to great honours, not to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in pleasures, wherein many repose their felicitie, nor in any temporall or worldly thing whatsoever; but in our redemption and the fruite thereof, which is a godly life, or (to expresse the same in other termes) in our justification and sanctification, which must teach us in our judgements to esteeme, in our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to desire, in our endevours to labour for these spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall graces above all the things in this world (for what is our happines, that is our chiefe good) estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all worldly things as drosse and dung, yea as losse in comparison thereof, Phil. 3.8.9. For as without these spirituall graces all worldly things are vaine and unprofitable yea, to them that set their hearts on them, hurtfull and pernicious; So having sought and obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned these graces, all temporall blessings shall be added unto us: or if we seeme to want any of them, our see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming want thereof shall not hinder our happines.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus much of <hi>Zacharies</hi> exposition of Gods Oath, now we come to the wordes thereof, <hi>that he would give us, &amp;c.</hi> This thing then promised in this Oath is a gift: Of this gift we are to speake; first in generall, and then in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. In generall, we may observe, first, the maine diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the Covenant of workes, made with all mankind: and the Covenant of Grace, made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, the heyres of promise. In the former, the Lord requireth perfect obedience to be performed by our selves to our justification, and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and denounceth his fearefull curse against those, that doe not continue in a totall &amp; perfect obedience. In the latter, the Lord, in stead of requiring perfect obedience to be performed of us to our justification &amp; salvation; promiseth to those, which beleeve, redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and justification without workes; and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and justified by faith, he promiseth to give them grace to walke in new obedience, as being an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable fruite of our redemption and justification, &amp; as the high-way wherein we are to walke towards our glorification. Of this new Covenant the holy Ghost prophecieth by <hi>Ieremy</hi> Chap. 31. vers. 31.32.33. <hi>Behold the dayes come saith the Lord that I will make a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, when I brought them out of Egypt</hi> (which was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10660:18"/>
the covenant of workes:) <hi>but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with them, I will put my law in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and write it in their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Which is the covenant of grace recited by the Apostle, Hebr. 8. v. 8.9.10. of which, being a better covenant, CHRIST is the mediator, v. 6. according to that Ioh. 1.17. <hi>The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by</hi> IESUS CHRIST. The same Covenant repeated by <hi>Ezechiel</hi> Chap. 36.26.27. The Gospell therefore or Covenant of Grace is not a new law, nor CHRIST a new law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver (as the Papists absurdly teach, confounding the law and the Gospel; saving that they teach, that the Gospell requireth more perfect obedience to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by our selves, then the law it selfe doth prescribe unto justification) but to them that are redeemed and justified by faith, it promiseth grace to walke in new obedience. How be it this is true, that men deprive themselves of what was promised in the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by disobedience: So if men doe live in sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, and without repentance, not so much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring, caring, and endeavouring to worshippe God in holynes and righteousnes: they can have no assurance that they are within the covenant of grace, made one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with those that truly beleeve: God having promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to those, which are redeemed and justified by faith, to give them grace to worshippe him, in holynes and righteousnes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly we note, that our justification and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication are both the free gifts of God, for it is he that redeemeth and justifieth, &amp; it is he also that sanctifieth, which point needeth no proofe, seeing God doth sweare they are both his gifts. The use whereof in a word is, that both they, which want these benefits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10660:19"/>
neither freed from the guilt of their sinnes, nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from their corruptions, may know where to seeke them: and also those that have them may be thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God the giver of them: which is the thing, whereunto the holy Ghost by <hi>Zachary</hi> exciteth us in this Psalme.</p>
                  <p>Now this gift promised by Oath (that I may come to the parts thereof) is twofold; our redemption or justification (for to be redeemed is to have our sins remitted Ephes. 1.7. Col. 1.14. and to have our sinnes remitted is to be justified) and the fruite or end of our redemption, which is our sanctification, consisting in the faithfull, sincere, and constant service of God in holynes and righteousnes.</p>
                  <p>Of these I am to speake, First, joyntly of both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and then of either of them severally. In the joynt consideration, we are to observe both the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and conjunction of them. The order is plainely expressed by the Participle <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>that being delivered from the hand of our enemies we should worship him, &amp;c.</hi> For the meaning of the holy Ghost is, that God would give us, both that we should be redeemed and delivered from the hand of our enemies; &amp; also that we should worship him; But to note the order, he hath expressed the former part, which is the benefit of redemption, by the Participle, <hi>that being delivered from the hand of our enemies we should worship him, &amp;c.</hi> which teacheth us, that before we can worship God aright, we must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the bondage of our spirituall enemies, &amp; that for two reasons. For first, naturally we are the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of sinne, and of Sathan. Being servants of sinne, we are in two respects utterly disabled from serving God, untill we be delivered out of this bondage, for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10660:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
first, <hi>being servants of sinne, we are free from righteousnes,</hi> Rom. 6.20. in respect of that privative corruption, which is in us all derived from our first parents; being a privation of <note n="t" place="margin">

                     </note> &amp; also of willing that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is good, and much more of doing that which is good; for will may be present when performance is wanting Rom. 7.18. But it is God that worketh in us both to will, and to doe, Phil. 2.13.

In regard whereof notwithstanding we may truly be said, besides the guiltines of <hi>Adams</hi> hainous transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to have but 2. faults; the one, that there is in us no goodnes spirituall, nor possibility of our selves, but a meere impotency to that which is good. The other, that there is in us naturally an evill disposition, and pronenesse unto all maner of sinne, which doth so domineere in us, that it imposeth a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of sinning, so that by nature, as we doe no good, neither can we thinke, or will, or doe that which is good; so doe we nothing but sinne, neither can we doe any thing but sinne. And as we are naturally the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of sinne; so by sinne we are also the servants of the devill, who is the Prince, Ioh. 12.31. and God of this world, 2 Cor. 4.4. under whose subjection the whole world of the wicked lyeth, 1 Iohn 5.19. who is the powerfull Prince of the aire, working effectually in the children of disobedience, Eph. 2.2. carrying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way captive to doe his will. 2. Tim. 2.26.</p>
                  <p>This servitude to sinne and Sathan, the mystery of our redemption doth presuppose. For if wee were not captives, we needed not to be redeemed. And hee doth therefore redeeme us, that wee might serve him; and therefore before he doth actually redeeme us, we cannot serve him in holynes and righteousnes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are by nature the <hi>children of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2.3. and enemies, yea rebells against GOD.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10660:21"/>
And therefore untill we be reconciled unto him by the death of Christ, and justified by faith through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought by Christ; we cannot doe any thing which may be acceptable to God. <hi>for they that are in the flesh cannot please God</hi> Rom. 8 8. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must be accepted, before his actions can be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; And <hi>without faith it is impossible to please God.</hi> Heb. 11.6.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be so, that we cannot serve God, or doe any thing that shall be accepted of him, unlesse we be first redeemed, justified, and reconciled to him: how doth it behove every one, that hath not yet obtayned these graces, to labour for them above all the things in this world? for untill then, he doth nothing but sinne, and by multiplying sinnes he doth hoard up wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the day of wrath.</p>
                  <p>The meanes on Gods part, is the preaching of the Gospell, which is therefore called the <hi>ministery of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi> which God hath committed to the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers thereof, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as his Embassadours in Christs steed, he intreateth you to be reconciled unto God. 2. Cor. 5.18.20.</p>
                  <p>The meanes on our part, are faith prayer, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For if thou dost truly, and by a lively faith effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually believe, that IESVS CHRIST is the Sonne of God, &amp; Saviour of all that believe in him; thou art bound to believe also (or els thou makest God a lyar) that he is thy Saviour, &amp; so believing thou art justified, &amp; being justified by faith, thou shalt have peace with GOD.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the Lord who is the party offended, &amp; needeth not thy friendshippe, desireth thee to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wilt not thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> the offendour,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10660:21"/>
who also without his favour, shalt perish eternally; wilt not thou (I say) by hearty and earnest prayer desire him to be reconciled unto thee? Now if thou dost by the prayer of faith desire God to be reconciled unto thee; what should hinder thy reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when thou desirest that of God, which God by his Ministers desireth of thee?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But unto these two we must add the duety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. For if we continue in sinne without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and please our selues in displeasing God; how can we perswade our selues, that we desire to be reconciled unto him? and if we doe not desire to be reconciled, then are we the professed enemies of God, for whom remaineth the fearefull <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 10.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now we are to speake of the concurrence of these two graces. For when the Lord sweareth, that to those whom he redeemeth and justifieth, he will giue grace to worshippe him in holines and righteousnes; from hence we doe necessarily collect, that sanctification is an unseparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of justification; and that no man can have assurance, that he is justified, unlesse he be in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure sanctified. Let no man therefore deceive <note n="c" place="margin">Iam. 2.14</note> himself with a vaine profession of an idle and dead faith, for unlesse thou doest, at the least, desire and endeavour to worship God in holines and righteousnes; it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. as the oath of the Lord is true, that as yet thou art not justified, nor actually made partaker of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought by Christ.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10660:22"/>
he came both with water and with bloud; with the bloud of redemption, to expiate the guilt of our sins, and with the water of ablution, or sanctification, to cleanse us from the corruption, 1. Ioh. 5.6. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of both, his bloud doth cleanse us from all our sinnes, 1. Ioh. 1.7 from the guilt, perfectly, in our justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, from the corruption, in part, and by degrees in our sanctification. See Hebr. 9.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whosoever are the sonnes of God by adoption, as all those are <note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.12.13.</note> that truly believe; they also are his by regeneration.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The same is implyed in the benefit of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby CHRIST our blessed Saviour doth not onely redeeme us from the guilt of sinne, which bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth men over to damnation, but also from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of sinne, that howsoever sinne doth <hi>remaine</hi> in the faithfull, yet it shall not <hi>reigne</hi> 
                     <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 6.14.</note> in them, nor have dominion over them. For they that practise sinne, are the servants of sinne, Ioh. 8.34. &amp; of Sathan, 1. Ioh. 3.8, in them sinne reigneth; and therefore they are not by CHRIST redeemed from the bondage of sin. <hi>For whom the sonne maketh free, they are free indeed,</hi> Ioh. 8.36.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The same is proved by the nature and properties of a true faith. For faith is a grace of regeneration, which the spirit of God, when he doth regenerate us, ingenerateth in us: whereby, as we are justified alone, because no other grace doth concurre with it to the act of justification: So are we sanctified in part, together with other graces; and therefore is never severed from the grace of regeneration, or from other sanctifying &amp; saving graces, &amp; further it is the property of faith ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving iustified us, inwardly to purifie the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Act. 15.9 &amp; outwardly to worke by love, Galat. 5.6. Therefore,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10660:23"/>
though to the act of justification, neither outward obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, nor inward graces doe concurre with faith, as any cause thereof: Yet in the subject, that is, in the party justified, they must, and doe concurre, as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fruites of a true and lively faith, without which it is dead.<note n="o" place="margin">

                  <p>Now, both from the order, and coniunction of these graces, we may inferre a singular cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lation to all the true Children of God. For if there be such a conjunction betweene these two graces of justification and sanctification, that whosoever hath the one, hath also the other, and who hath not both hath neither: then it followeth necessarily, that, as he that is justified, is also sanctified; So he that is sanctified, is also justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and if the order betweene them be such, that a man cannot serve God in the duties of sanctification, untill he be justified, nor cannot worship God aright, untill he be redeemed from his spirituall enemies: then it followeth necessarily, that they who are in any true measure sanctified, are also justified; that they who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely desire, and endeavour to walke in the obedience of Gods holy will, making conscience of their wayes, are redeemed from the hand of their spirituall enemies. And not onely may we from our sanctification come to the certaine knowledge of our justification: but also we may thereby make our calling &amp; our election sure. For dost thou, professing the true faith, endeavour to keepe a good conscience and to walke uprightly before God; then it is certaine, that thou art justified by a true faith; art thou justified? then it is certaine, that thou art effectually called art thou called according to Gods purpose? then without doubt thou are elected art
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10660:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thou elected? then undoubtedly thou shalt be saved. Seeing then such singular comfort ariseth from the leading of a godly and upright life, as that thereby we may make our calling and election sure, hereby we should all of us be excited to the study of godlines, and practise of piety: for the greatest comfort that we can have in this life, is to be assured of our election and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

But the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of mankind have never the grace to worshippe God in holines and righteousnes, and therefore to them the benefit of redemption doth not belong.</p>
                  <p>Now, when <hi>we</hi> doe professe our selves to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed of the Lord, we do withall confesse, that in our selves we are bondmen, and servants, whom CHRIST came to redeeme out of this bondage. But howsoever all will challenge to themselves the benefit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, yet how few, in comparison, doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their bondage? But like the unbelieving <hi>Iewes,</hi> when our Saviour promised them libertie, professe, that they never were in servitude, Ioh. 8.33. and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray themselves not to be redeemed. But this humble conceipt of our selves before our justification is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for us, if either we would seeke to CHRIST, or have him to respect us. For if by nature we be not in bondage, what need we a redeemer? If not lost, what need we a Saviour? <note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 9.12.</note>

The infinite and unspeakeable love of God the father, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his onely begotten Sonne, and of God the Sonne in giving himselfe for us; and of God the Holy Ghost the spirit of grace, in communicating unto us the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and love of God, and the merite and vertue of all that Christ did or suffered for us.</p>
                  <p>For the first <hi>herein is love,</hi> saith the beloved Apostle, <hi>not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Sonne to be the propitiation for our sinnes.</hi> 1.

                  <p n="3">3. The persuasion of this love of God affordeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us singular comfort, in divers respects. As first in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. For therefore doe we glory <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 5, 3, 4.5</note> in afflictions, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence experience, and experience hope, &amp; hope maketh not ashamed, because <hi>the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost which is given unto us</hi> that is, because by faith wrought in us by the holy Ghost, we are perswaded of the love of God in Christ, which love God commendeth towards us, in that, when we were sinners, Christ died for us.</p>

But Christ our sweet saviour, being not onely man, but God also; gave himselfe not for his friends, but for his enimies; and that, not to a common and ordinary death, but to the most painfull, most shamefull and most accursed death of the crosse, and not onely to suffer a corporall death, but also in his soule to undergoe the wrath of God in our steed; the feare whereof, when he was in that grievous ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, caused him to sweat great dropps of bloud, Luk. 22.44. and the sence thereof on the crosse, being in his owne sence as a man forsaken of God, made him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Mat. 27.6.</p>
                  <p>The acknowledgment of this wonderfull love of CHRIST, ought first to worke in us a love in some measure answerable to his; that as he gave himselfe for us an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour. Eph. 5.2. so we should present our bodies a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto him, which is our reasonable service, Rom. 12.1. And as he gave himselfe for us, so should we be willing and ready, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion serve, to lay downe our lives for him, the rather because he hath promised, that whosoever shall loose his life for his sake; &amp; the Gospells, shall save it, Marc. 8.35. We owe our selves unto CHRIST in a double or treble respect: first, for that in our creation he gave us to our selves: secondly, because in our redemption,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10660:27"/>
when we were lost, he restored us to our selves: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when in restoring us, he gave himselfe for us. For our selves given and restored, we may and ought to give and render our selves; but what retribution shall we make him for himselfe? For though we should give and render our selves to him, or for him a thousand times, yet what are we to him? as <hi>Bernard</hi> 
                     <note n="e" place="margin">

                     </note> sweetly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are to imitate our blessed Saviour, as the Apostle exhorteth us in respect of his love, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it selfe in his wonderfull humiliation and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for us. Phil. 2.5. <hi>Let the same minde be in you which was in Christ Iesus,</hi> who being God coequall with his Father, for our sakes abased himselfe to become man: and being man, humbled himselfe, not onely to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive obedience, performing all righteousnes, as being made subject to the Law for us; but also to the passive obedience, being obedient to death, even the death of the Crosse; &amp; all this for us men, &amp; for our salvation.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have heard the love of the Father, in giving his Sonne, and the love of the Sonne, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himselfe for us; whereunto we may add the love both of the Father and the Sonne, in sending the holy Spirit, the spirit of love to accomplish our redemption, and also of the Holy Ghost, who furnisheth with his graces, and furnished, sendeth forth the Embassadours and Ministers of God, committing unto them the meanes of our salvation; in and by which, he having united us to CHRIST, and made us partakers of him, he worketh effectually in the hearts of Gods chosen, all those saving and sanctifying graces, whereby they are not onely entituled unto Gods Kingdome, but also fitted and prepared for the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:10660:27"/>But as in the worke of our Rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption we have observed the wonderfull love of God: so in the second place we are to observe his infinite justice manifested in the same. For such is the justice of God, that rather then he would suffer the sinnes of his owne elect children to goe unpunished, he hath punished them in the death of his onely begotten Sonne. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration whereof ought to strike a terror in them, that doe not believe, nor repent. For if God punished the sinnes of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in CHRIST, what shall become of them, who have no part in CHRIST? undoubtedly every sinne, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth death, so is it punished with death; either with the death of CHRIST in the behalfe of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or with the death of the parties themselves, who are not in CHRIST. And as it ministreth terror to the wicked; so it affordeth singular comfort to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, who are in CHRIST. For they may from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of this justice of God, safely conclude; that to them, being in CHRIST, there is not onely no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but not so much as any punishments so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called, which in order of justice is inflicted by way of vengeance to satisfy the justice of God. For CHRIST having fully satisfied the justice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the behalfe of all them that believe; it cannot stand with the justice of God to punish the same sinnes in the party, which he hath already punished in CHRIST. The children of God are indeed subject to manifold afflictions, which are <hi>mala poena,</hi> but unto them the nature of them is changed, so that they be not punishments to them, but either fatherly chastisements, (<hi>for when</hi> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.32</note>

                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:10660:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thirdly, we observe how haynous, and how dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable our sinnes are in the sight of GOD: the guilt whereof could not be expiated, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That both in respect of our sinnes past we should be touched with remorse, when we consider that by our sinnes we nayled our Saviour to the crosse, (to which end we are to pray, that the Lord would poure upon us <note n="g" place="margin">Zach: 12, 10</note> the <hi>spirit of grace and supplication,</hi> that when we locke upon him, whom we have pierced we might lament and mourne, as a father mourneth for his onely sonne:) and also in respect of the time to come, we should not be animated to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any sinne, as being small; seeing there is none so small, but the price of it was the precious bloud of CHRIST: none so light, but that if we be not eased from the burthen of it by the merits of CHRIST, it is of sufficient weight to presse us downe to hell.</p>
                  <p>The third thing to be considered in the doctrine of redemption, are the enemies from whom we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; which are not carnall, as the Iewes imagine, dreaming that their Messias should be a temporal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, who having subdued their enemies, which held them in subjection, should restore the Kingdome to Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, but spirituall. And these are the <hi>law, sinne, death,</hi> &amp; the <hi>devill</hi>; the <hi>law</hi> being the strength of sinne, <hi>sinne</hi> the sting of death, and <hi>death</hi> the power of the devill, from the hand, that is, from the power of all which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour CHRIST hath delivered us.</p>
                  <p>If it be demaunded, why among the enemies I doe not reckon the world. I answere, if by World, be meant worldly desires, as 1. Ioh. 2.15.16. they are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

under the title of sinne: if wicked worldlings, they are but the seed of the serpent, and the instruments of the Devill. And in both sences, not onely our Saviour hath overcome the world for us, Iohn 16.33. but the faithfull also in and by him. 1. Iohn 4.4.5.4.5.</p>
                  <p>The law by reason of our transgression is an enemy unto us; whether we consider the yoke of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall law, or the bondage wherein the morall law did hold us. From the yoke of the ceremoniall laws, <note n="h" place="margin">

Not every one that saith, <hi>Lord Lord,</hi> shall enter into the kingdome of heaven, but he that doth the will of my father which is in heaven. Mat. 7.22.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10660:32"/>
this great benefit of redemption, if we have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the end therof; which is our sanctification. For else what can be the cause of such dissolute living, as is every where to be seene among those who professe themselves redeemed by CHRIST, but a foolish opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that CHRIST having freed them from their sinnes, they may sinne the more freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dyed for their sinnes, they need not to die to them, &amp; so abuse the <hi>grace</hi> 
                     <note n="p" place="margin">Iude 4.</note> 
                     <hi>of God unto wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes.</hi> For if our sanctification be the end of our redemption then do we abuse this great benefit of GOD, if we doe not referre it to this end. yea rather, we deceive and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse our selves with a vaine opinion of our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For if this be the end of our redemption, then those that live in sinne as the servants of sinne, either are not redeemed (for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ the sonne maketh free, they are free indeed) or els they are redeemed in vaine, for that is in vaine which is frustrate of the end.</p>
                  <p>Now that sanctification is the end of our redemption, it may be proved by the testimonies of holy scripture, and also by sound reasons drawne from thence. Tit. 2.14. <hi>Christ hath given himselfe for us, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme us from all iniquity, and that he might purify or</hi> sanctify <hi>to himselfe a peculiar people, zelous of good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</hi> Eph. 5.25.26.27. <hi>Christ loved his church &amp; gave himselfe for it, that he might sanctify and clense it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himselfe a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish.</hi> Col. 1.21.22. You that were enimies Christ hath reconciled in the body of his flesh through death <hi>to present you holy &amp; unblameable in his sight.</hi> 1. Pet. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>4 Christ himselfe bare our sinnes in his owne body, on the tree, that we, <hi>being dead to sinne should live unto righteousnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:10660:32"/>The reason is evident. For that which is the end of all Gods blessings in this life, both spirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, must needs be the end of our Redemption. But our sanctification is the end of all Gods blessings in this life. 1. Thess. 4.3. This <hi>is the will of God even your sanctification</hi>; this is that which God willeth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth in bestowing his benefits upon us. He hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected us, that <hi>we might be holy.</hi> Eph. 1.4. he created us after his owne image, that we might worship him in holines and righteousnes, Eph. 4.24. he hath called us <hi>to holines</hi> 1. Thess 4.7 and we are called to be Saints, or Saints by calling, Rom. 1.7. 1. Cor. 1.2. he doth rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate us to the same end. For we are the <hi>workmanship of God created in Iesus Christ unto good workes, which God hath before ordayned that we should walke in them.</hi> Eph. 2.10. To the same end he hath planted us in his Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we might be called <hi>trees of righteousnes,</hi> bringing forth fruite to his glory, Es 61.3. and finally to the same end he bestoweth his temporall benefits u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon us. The Psalmist having in the 105 Psalme recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the manifold blessings of God bestowed upon the Israelites, in the last verse he concludeth this to be the end of all, <hi>that they might observe his statutes and keepe his lawes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as it is the end, so also the fruite of our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; as it is plainly delivered in this text, <hi>that he would give us, that we being deliuered from the hand of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, should worship him without feare in holines and righteousnes.</hi> More plainly, Rom. 6.22. <hi>Being made free from sinne, and become servants to God, we have our fruit unto holines, and the end everlasting life.</hi> And to these, we may add Heb. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow this worship of God, which is the fruite and end of our redemption, is here notably described, by the parts and properties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The parts are <hi>holines</hi> and <hi>righteousnes.</hi> For by holines, you are to understand the dueties of the first Table, viz. of piety and religion towards God by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10660:34"/>
righteousnes, the duties of the second table, which we owe unto men, And of these we are to speake, first, joyntly, of them both together, and then of either of them severally.</p>
                  <p>Holines and righteousnes, as they are here joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the holy Ghost, so in practise they may not be severed. Those that are in Christ are new <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17</note> creatures, renewed according to the image of God <hi>in</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note>
                     <hi>true holines and righteousnes.</hi> And in this place the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to give to those that are redeemed, to worshippe him, not in holines alone, nor in righteousnes alone but in holines and righteousnes. And therfore those things, which God hath conjoyned, let no man sever. for these two are so conjoyned by God, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath the one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath the other: and whosoever hath not both, hath neither of them in deed and in truth. <hi>He that loveth God, loveth his neighbour also.</hi> 1. Ioh. 4.21 neither can a man love God in truth, that loveth not his brother also, as St. Iohn argueth. <hi>If any man say I love God, &amp; hateth his brother, he is a lyar, for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seene, how can he love God, whom he hath not seene?</hi> 1. Iohn. 4.20. for true is the old saying, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Neither can a man love his neighbour as he ought, but he will love God much more, For our brother is to be loved in the Lord; and for the Lord. And it was well said of Bernard licet aliquid diligere preter Deu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, modo id diligamus propter Deum. Now it is a rule in Philosophy. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>for what any thing is, that is much more.</hi> Therfore if we love our brother for Gods sake, then doe we love God much more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10660:34"/>Here therefore two sorts of men are to be reproved. The former is of those, who would seme to be forward professors of religion and piety towards God, that are very backward in the dueties of cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ity and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to their brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such were the Phatisies, whom our saviour calleth hypocrites, bidding us to beware of the leaven of the Pharisies, which is hypocrisie for sayeth he <hi>unlesse your righteousnes exceed the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the scribes and Pharisies, you shall not enter into the kingdome of heaven.</hi> Mat. 5.20.</p>
                  <p>These men are wont to discover their hypocrisy, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their words, and partly by their works. By their words, being evill speakers detracters, and depravers of their brethren: who with the same tongue blesse God, &amp; curse man, who is made after the similitude of God Iam. 3.9. But the said St. Iames ch. 1.26. hath given his censure of these men.</p>
                  <p>For saith he, <hi>if any man among you seeme to be religious and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his owne heart, this mans religion is vaine:</hi> By their works: cloaking under the shewe of religion hard dealing and deceipt; having <hi>Iacobs</hi> voice, and <hi>Esau's</hi> hands; scandalizing the profession of religion by their hypocrisy. The holy Ghost therfore to discover such hypocrits, when he would sett downe the marks and notes of men truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, describeth them commonly by the dueties which they performe to their brethren: making them the touchstone, as it were, of their piety and religion towards GOD. Psalm. 15. and 24. Iam. 1.27.</p>
                  <p>The other sort is of those, who professing themselves to be christians are but civill honest men, void of piety, and religion towards GOD. I speake not against
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10660:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
civill honesty, which is very commendable and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; in so much as they who want it are worse then some of the hearthen that know not God. For many of the heathen were of a civill and honest conversation, yea some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> excelled in morall vertues But I would not have a Christian to rest, in a faire outward civill conversation among men, as though no more were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him. For if a man, pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>essing himselfe a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, shall have no more in him then the Paganes who knew not GOD: can such a one be esteemed a sownd Christian? Our love of men must proceed from the love of God; the streames of our justice and charity towards men, must be detived from the fountaine of piety towards God. <hi>without</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 11 6.</note> 
                     <hi>faith it is impossible to please God.</hi> without faith, without piety, without the feare of God, without repentance, the best actions of civill honest men, are but <hi>splendida peccata.</hi> The chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est care of a Christian must be to worship God, first in the duties of piety and religion; and secundarily in the duties of righteousnes and charity towards men.</p>
                  <p>But the meere civill honest man neither worshippeth, God in the dueties of piety, nor yet in the dueties of righteousnes; which he performeth as a meere naturall man, without any respect or relation had unto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therfore cannot be said in doing those duties to serve God in righteousnes, as not performing them in obedience to God, or for Gods sake.</p>
                  <p>Now if they which want either of these are not to be deemed sownd Christians, what shall we say of those which have neither; yea that not so much as seeme to have either? profane and wicked men, who professing themselves Christians, that is to say men redeemed by CHRIST, <hi>turne</hi>

                     </gap>fly, and in a word. For if I should treat of them at large; under the title of <hi>holines,</hi> I should discourse of all the duties required in the first table of the decalogue; in all which we must think our selves bound to worship God, if we will worship him in <hi>holines.</hi> And under the name of <hi>righteousnes</hi> I should treat of all the dueties of the second table, all which we must endevour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to our neighbour in obedience to God, if we would be thought to worshipp or to serve him in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes.</p>
                  <p>But first, we are to speak of holines; because that is the first and the great commaundement. Mat. 22.38.</p>
                  <p>That holines is a fruite of our redemption, the holy Ghost doth plainely testify Rom. 6.22. Being freed from sinne and made servants to God, <hi>you have your fruite unto holines,</hi> and the end everlasting life. And that it is also the end of our redemption, St. Paul wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth Eph. 5.27. Col. 1.22. And as it is the fruite and end of our redemption and justification in part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so is it also a necessary forerunner of glorification. And therfore if we shall truly worship the Lord in holines, we may be assured, that the Lord hath redeemed us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and consequently, as we have the fruite of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in holines; so shall we have the end therof, which is the salvation of our soules. Rom. 6.22. Apoc. 20.6. But contrary wise, if our conversation be unholy and unpure, as we want the fruite of our redemption, so shall we never attaine to the end therof, which is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10660:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
everlasting life. For as the holy Ghost witnesseth Heb. 12.14. <hi>without holines no man shall see God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Righteousnes also, as hath bene said, is in part the fruite and end of our redemption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for being <hi>freed from sinne we become the servants of righteousnes,</hi> Rom. 6.18. and therfore did our saviour in his <hi>owne body on the tree beare our sinnes, that we dying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>But here some may object; if righteousnes contayne the duties which we owe to man, whither our brethren or our selves; how is it here f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> mercy, and to humble thy selfe to walke with thy God?</hi> Mic. 6.6.7.8. The fast which God accepteth, is to fast from the sinnes of unrighteousnes and oppression, and to performe the duties of charity and justice. Es. 58.6.7. Their Religion also God doth approve as pure and undefiled, who exercise the workes of mercy and charity to those that are in misery, I am. 1.27. and such will he pronounce blessed at the last day, who have approved their faith and piety by doing the workes of <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 25.34.40.</note> mercy and charity to the poore members of CHRIST, which he esteemeth as done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. And let me add this for the comfort of true Christians, who walke uprightly in a lawfull calling, though it be never so meane, that by doing the workes of their calling justly in obedience to God, seeking Gods glory in the good of their brethren, they worship God in righteousnes. And let them assure themselves, that their lawfull &amp; honest calling is that station, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord hath placed them to serve him in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes. But they must remember withall, that they who so serve him in righteousnes, must also, and that principally, be carefull to worship him in holines. And this is to be understood of civill callings. But as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ministers of Gods word, this may further be added for their comfort, that so many of them as with good conscience take paines in their function, whether in their private studies, or in their publike ministery,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10660:37"/>
seeking to glorifie God in the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church, or the members thereof: they doe worship God both in holines and in righteousnes.</p>
                  <p>By this which hath bene said it plainly appeareth, that howsoever we are freed from the curse the rigour, the terror, and irritation of the law; yet we are not freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the obedience of the law morall. For freedome from obedience, and righteousnes, is the servitude of sinne. But we are freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bondage of sinne, that we may be enabled with upright hearts and willing minds to worship the Lord in holines and in righteousnes. And therfore, howsoever carnall gospellers and libertines, abuse the liberty which CHRIST hath purchased as an occasion to the flesh, turning the grace of God into wantonnes, to their owne perdition: Yet devillish is the sclander of the Papists, who calumniate the doctrine of the Gospell, as if we taught therby, that <note n="h" place="margin">Bellarm. de justif. lib. 4. c. 5.</note> men are freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obedience to all lawes whatsoever of God, &amp; man, yea from the decalogue it selfe. But this needeth no answere, it being evident to all the world, that we doe urge the obedience of the lawe morall as well as they doe, and by better arguments &amp; reasons, then they doe. For their cheife reasons are taken from the falsly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed benefits of good works, that they satisfy for sin, justify before GOD, and merit eternall life. but by these reasons they teach men to marre good works, and not to doe them. for a good worke done with the the opinion, of satisfaction, justification, or merit, is so farre from being a good worke, that it is odious &amp; abominable in the sight of GOD; as being deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the most perfect satisfaction, and all-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent merit of CHRIST our saviour.</p>
                  <p>But we among other arguments, take some from
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10660:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this text: Because our new obedience or practice of good works is the fruite and end of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. because it is an unseparable companion of our redemption and justification. 3. because God hath sworne, that he will give the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are redeemed grace to worship him in holines and righteousnes, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that works in them that are redeemed or justified, doe follow necessarily by necessity of infallibility. And therfore it is impossible, the oath of the Lord being true (which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not possibly be untrue) that a man should be actually redeemed or justified, and yet have no care to practise good works, that is to say, to performe the dueties of holines and righteousnes. But in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects also, we doe urge the necessity of good works, which we prove to be necessary also <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> &amp; so by necessity of Duety, which we owe 1. unto God, to shew our selves obedient &amp; thankfull unto him &amp; studious of his glory 2. to our neighbour, &amp; 3. to our selves, likewise <hi>necessitate signi,</hi> not onely as they are the testimonies &amp; toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wherby we are to make our calling &amp; electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sure: but also, as they are the evidence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which our saviour wil judge us at the last day. &amp; lastly <hi>necessitate medij</hi>: for although we are not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor saved for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet they are the way wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in we are to walke toward our heavenly countrey; as <hi>Bernard</hi> well said, that they be <hi>via regni</hi> the way to the kingdome, though not <hi>causa regnandi,</hi> the cause of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the kingdome.

piety and godnnes Ps. 111.10. Pro. 9 10. Of the other, there may be a question; whether God hath promised to those that are redeemed, that they shall worship him without all servile feare, seeing that it is profitable, that men should be restrayned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin by feare of punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And to that end, doth the Lord threaten judgments &amp; punishments to terrify &amp; to deterre men from sinne.</p>
                  <p>To this I answere, as I deliuered before in the doctrine of redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that our saviour in delivering us fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the terror &amp; coaction of the lawe, doth free us also fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile feare, But we are to consider <hi>quatenus,</hi> how farre forth. For such as is our redemption (I speake of it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, as it is in the redeemed) such is our freedome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> servile feare; to wit, inchoated or begunne in this life, and increasing by degrees; compleat, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the life to come, which is called our full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being not totall in this life, doth not free us totally from this servile feare. Full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect charity in deed casteth out this feare, and he that thus <hi>feareth, is not perfected in charity,</hi> 1 Iohn. 4.18. But whiles the reliques of sinne, or rather the <hi>body of sinne</hi> remayneth in us, whiles we are in part flesh, as well as spirit, we have not perfect charity.</p>
                  <p>And therfore so farre forth, as we are flesh, we are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to servile feare: yea so farre as we are carnall, we are servants, Rom. 7.14.23. but so farre forth as we are spirit, we are freed from that feare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as not being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lawe, but under grace. yet because concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and the corruptions of the flesh, still abide in us; it was expedient for the subduing and mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the flesh, that we should in some part be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to this feare. To which end the rest also of our spirituall enimies, though they be overcome, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10660:41"/>
we delivered out of their power, are still left to encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us: that we standing upon our guard, and exercising and maintayning a spirituall warfare against them, may at length triumph over them, and receive the crowne promised to those that overcome.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time we are freed from this servile feare by degrees from the time of our justification to our glorification, as our faith hope and charity do increase by increase whereof we are more and more enabled to worship God, as without feare, so also with willing &amp; cheerfull minds. And therfore we are to be stirred up to labour for the encrease or these graces in us, that our feare may be diminished and our assurance encreased; wherein our happines in this life doth consist.</p>

The spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all security, in respect of the subject is, when a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justified before God by faith, and assured in some measure of his favour, as knowing himselfe to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived grace to believe, and having peace of conscience worshippeth God in assured expectation of everlasting life.

                     </gap> or spirituall security the holy

Ghost speaketh in this place.</p>
                  <p>The summe of that which hath bene said by the way of exposition, is this: that GOD hath promised to give the faithfull being redeemed by CHRIST, to worship him without feare, not without the true feare of GOD (for that is a chiefe part of his worship) but without feare of their spirituall enimies; and namely without feare of damnation: and that in two degrees, so that they may worship him without feare, that is without cause of feare, securely and safely without danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their salvation is certaine and sure, there being no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus.</p>
                  <p>Secondly without feare it selfe, namely of their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, from whose power they believe themselves to be redeemed, and consequently from the servile feare of God, performing a worship unto him, not of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaves (who are under the dominion of the law) forced and extorted from them by servile feare, but the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of sonnes yeelding voluntary obedience. Not that we are delivered from servile feare altogether, and at once in this life, but by degrees, according to the measure of our faith, hope, and charity, wherewith we being indued in some good measure, shall worship the Lord securely, or in security, not carnall, but spirituall and consequently not in feare of damnation, but in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of everlasting happines.</p>
                  <p>Now this being the principall point in this whole text, and the chiefe thing wherein the happines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in CHRIST the promised seed doth consist in this life; viz. <hi>to worship the Lord without feare:</hi> therfore as I have stood the longer in explaining the words; so I will endevour to sett downe the doctrines and uses, which are to be made of this point.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first doctrine: that there is a twofold cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of salvation of all those that truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in CHRIST. The former is called the certainty of the object, in regard whereof the salvation of all that truly believe is sure &amp; certaine, though they perhapps be not assured thereof. For this is the maine promise of the Gospell, that <hi>whosoever doth truly believe in Christ shall not perish, but have life everlasting.</hi> Iohn. 3.16. <hi>To my sheepe</hi> (saith our saviour) that is, to all the faithfull, <hi>I will give eternall life, and they shall never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, neither shall any be able to pluck the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of my hands.</hi> Iohn. 10.28. St. Peter testifieth. 1. Epist. 1.5. that the faithfull <hi>are kept safe by the power of God through faith unto salvation.</hi> And the Apostle Paul, Rom. 8.1. that <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in this place the Lord by oath assureth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they <hi>shall worship him without feare,</hi> that is, without cause of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, such is the certainty of their salvation, who truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the holy Ghost doubteth not to affirme, <hi>that they have eternall life.</hi> Iohn. 6.47.54. 1. Iohn. 5.11.12. and that <hi>they are passed from death to life.</hi> Iohn. 5.24. and that whom the Lord <hi>hath justified, he hath also glorified.</hi> Rom. 8.30.</p>
                  <p>The latter is the certainty of the subject, when a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, sowndly applying the promises of the Gospel to himselfe, is persuaded and in some measure assured of his salvation, for he that knoweth himselfe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10660:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may apply the promise to himselfe, and by appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be assured of that which is promised.</p>
                  <p>This certainty of perswasion, or assurance some call <hi>speciall faith. speciall</hi> I say, first, in respect of the object, which is Christ, and is therfore called sometimes <hi>the faith of Iesus Christ.</hi> Rom. 3.22.26. Gal. 2.16.20.3.22. Phil. 3 9. sometimes <hi>faith in Christ.</hi> Acts. 20.21.24.24.26.18. Gal. 3.26. <hi>faith in his bloud.</hi> Rom. 3.25. For although by that faith, which doth justify, we doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all the articles of faith, &amp; the whole word of God and every part and parcell thereof contayning threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings as well as promises; yet the object of it, <hi>quatenus justificat,</hi> is CHRIST. For it justifieth, as it is the instrument to receive CHRIST, who is our righteousnesse. Secondly, and more especially it is called <hi>speciall,</hi> in regard of the effect, which is, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to apply CHRIST unto our selves. And this speciall Faith is a degree of that assurance, which the Grecians call <gap reason="foreign">

So unseparable, that sometimes it seemeth to be implyed in the phrase of <hi>believing in Christ.</hi> For to believe in Christ impl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But though it be an unseparable fruit of faith,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10660:43"/>
yet it is not to be confownded with it. For faith is the cause, affiance the effect. For by faith we have affiance Eph. 3.12. upon which place <hi>Beza</hi> noteth, that they are deceived, who confownd faith and affiance. Faith, is a perswasion or assurance of the mind, though working upon the heart: affiance, is an affection of the heart, though proceeding from the assurance of the minde. The seat therefore of faith is the minde, or intellectuall part; of affiance, the heart, which is the seat of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And as in subiect they differ, so also in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; the object of faith, being <hi>verum</hi>: of affiance, <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there being litle difference betwixt it and <hi>hope</hi> in respect of the time to come, which are oft in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures confounded, the same word <hi>Batach</hi> being transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sometimes to <hi>trust,</hi> and sometimes to <hi>hope.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding in the behalfe of some of our Divines it may be said, that when they call this speciall faith <hi>fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam</hi> or fiduciall assent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they meane nothing else but a certaine perswasion or assurance of that which is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>This speciall Faith the Papists abhorre, and scorne; and yet cannot deny, but that true Christians ought to labour for assurance, namely the assurance, not of faith but of hope. They must have a kinde of hope, that their sinnes be remitted, and that they shalbe saved, but they may not believe the remission of their sinnes, or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, as belonging to themselves. Howbeit all their assurance is meerely conjecturall and uncertaine: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they have any sownd assurance of hope, unlesse first they had assurance of Faith. for Faith is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of hope, and the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>the substance of things hoped for.</hi> But howsoever the Papists doe scorne the speciall Faith; yet it is a certaine truth, that there is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10660:43"/>
not any grace, either more profitable to the faithfull, or more necessary. For as all other saving graces in the faithfull proceed from Faith, first apprehending, and after applying CHRIST unto themselves, in so much, that without it there is no other saving grace; so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the measure of it, such is the measure of all other saving graces.</p>
                  <p>That speciall Faith, which the Holy Ghost worketh in us, by <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 5.5. Faith produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> 
                     <hi>shedding abroad the love of God in our hearts,</hi> (that is by perswading our soules of the love of GOD towards us in CHRIST) produceth the love of GOD, (for <hi>therefore doe we love</hi>

For when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that CHRIST is our Saviour, wee rest upon him for salvation. It worketh in us hope; for when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the promises belong unto us, we expect the performance. Faith having begotten affiance &amp; hope, and working by love, begetteth zeale, peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Rom. 5.1. rejoycing in God, and joy in the Holy Ghost, thankfulnes, voluntary &amp; cheerfull obedience, patience,<note place="margin">No other sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace without faith.</note> and comfort in afflictions, &amp;c. And in deed how can a man <hi>love his neighbour</hi> for Gods sake, who loveth not God much more? how can a man <hi>love God</hi> as he ought, who is not perswaded of Gods love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him in CHRIST? which perswasion is this spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Faith. And if he cannot love God without Faith, much lesse can he have the <hi>zeale</hi> of God: for zeale is the fervency of love. How can a man have <hi>affiance</hi> in CHRIST, and rest upon him for salvation, who is not by Faith perswaded, and in some measure assured, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10660:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he is his Saviour? How can he hope and waite for the performance of the promises, that doth not believe that they belong unto him? Faith being the substance of things hoped for. How can a man have true peace of conscience, who is not perswaded, that God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him? How can a man <hi>reioyce</hi> in God, who is not assured of Gods favour towards him? How can a man <hi>trust in God,</hi> that is not perswaded of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes towards him? How can a man be <hi>thankfull</hi> unto God, who is not perswaded of Gods love and bownty towards him? How shall they <hi>feare God</hi> as sonnes, that is, fearing to offend so mercifull a Father, who are not perswaded that he is their Father in CHRIST? or when they have sinned, how shall they be encouraged to <hi>returne</hi> unto him, if they be not perswaded of his fatherly respect to them? how shall they performe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and chearefull <hi>obedience,</hi> who are not perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that their endevours are accepted of him? How shall they <hi>pray,</hi> who doe not believe they shall be heard? Or as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>how shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed?</hi> Rom. 10.14. How shall they <hi>patiently</hi> and comfortably beare afflictions, who are not perswaded they be fatherly chastisements or tryalls proceeding from Gods love, and tending to their good? Finally, with what heart can men <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> God, who are not perswaded, that their service is accepted of him?</p>

                  <p>Wherfore it is evident, that they which renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce this Faith, as the Papists doe, discover the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves to be voide of all saving graces, &amp; to have no truth nor power of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in them. But whatsoever they thinke or speak of speciall Faith, let us know and acknowledge these three things. First, that it is the duety of every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, that doth truly assent to the doctrine of the Gospell, to <hi>apply</hi> also by speciall Faith the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Gospell unto himselfe. For this is most profitable, most comfortable, most necessary. Profitable, because from this application of Faith, all other graces doe proceede, as hath beene said. Comfortable, because by this application, we grow to assurance, as shall be shewed. Necessary; first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that beliefe or assent is not lively and effectuall (as you shall heare) which is not joyned with a desire to apply CHRIST to thy selfe, and with a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to acknowledge him to be thy Saviour, and to rest
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:10660:45"/>
upon him for salvation, For although he, which at the first believeth onely by assent, doth not yet actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply the promises of the Gospell to himselfe; yet that assent, if it be lively and effectuall, worketh both an earnest desire, and setled resolution of application. 2. he that knoweth himselfe to believe by a true assen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and refuseth to apply the promises to himselfe, he maketh GOD a lyar, as shalbe shewed. 3. where this application is not at least in desire, resolution, and endevour, there is no other saving grace, as I have proved.</p>
                  <p>The second thing, which we are to take notice of, is, that it is the chiefest comfort, and in deed <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines</hi> of a Christian in this life, by speciall faith to be assured of the eternall love and favour of GOD in CHRIST. For so <hi>Zachary</hi> in this place expoundeth our blessednes to be this, being redeemed by Christ to worship God <hi>without feare.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The third, that seing it is a thing so profitable, so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and so comfortable that our happines is to be reposed therein: it is therfore our duety to doe our best endevour, to attaine unto the assurance of salvation, &amp; to this speciall faith: or as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in other words <hi>to giue diligence to make our calling and election sure.</hi> 2. Peter. 1.10. or as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, 1. Tim. 6.19. to <hi>lay up in store, a good foundation against the time to come, that we may lay hold upon eternall life.</hi> For though the Apostle in that place doth by this argument ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them that be rich to works of charity: yet his meaning is not, that those works are the fown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; but that we by doeing of them, may gather assurance to our selves of our justifycation
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10660:45"/>
and salvation, as by testimonies and evidences of our faith. which assurance of speciall faith is so sure a fowndation against the day of tryall, as they who have built thereon, cannot by any temptation be removed, but like mount Sion stand fast for ever, or like to three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>square or triangular bodies, which, howsoeuer they be tossed and turned, keepe alwayes their positure, which is <hi>undique sursum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now you must not think, that full assurance is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned at the first, or at once; but we must attayne unto it by divers degrees.<note place="margin">The first Step is humility.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And first we are to know, that the ordinary way to exaltation by sound comfort and assurance, is <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to that generall rule given by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, after he had reported the notable humiliation of the penitent Publicane (which rule is also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in divers other places of scripture) that, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever exalteth himselfe shalbe abased: but he that humbleth himselfe, shalbe exalted Luk. 18.14. <note n="s" place="margin">Matth 23.12.</note> St. Peter therfore having signified, <hi>that the Lord resisteth the prowd, but giveth grace to the humble,</hi> inferreth this exhortation: <hi>humble your selves therfore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.</hi> 1. Pet 5.5.6.</p>
                  <p>This worke of humiliation, the Holy Ghost ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily worketh in Gods children by the ministery of the law, wherby he revealeth unto us our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable estate in our selves, in respect both of our sinnes, (<hi>for</hi> 
                     <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 3.29.</note> 
                     <hi>by the law co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the knowledge of sinne</hi>) and also of the punishment, denouncing the fearefull plagues of God for sinne, both in this life and in the world to come. Thus when Peter had declared to the Iewes their haynous sinne in crucifying Christ; they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10660:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>were pricked in their hearts,</hi> and said to the Apostles, <hi>men and brethren what shall we doe?</hi> Act. 2.23.36.37. When the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> had by a Parable, which he applied to <hi>David</hi> the King, aggravated his sinne, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>thou art the man: David</hi> both privately testified his humiliation to the Prophet, saying,<note n="u" place="margin">1.

                     <hi>I haue sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord</hi>; and also publikely professed the same, Psalm. 51.

And as for humiliation wrought by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of judgments, consider the example of <hi>Iosias,</hi> 2. Kings 22.11.13.19. Of the Ninivites, Ion. 3.5.6. In like manner ought wee to bee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before GOD, when wee consider that our sinnes are so haynous and detestable in the sight of GOD, that nothing could satisfy the justice of GOD, or appease his wrath for them, or expiate the guilt of them, but the death and sufferings of the Eternall and onely begotten Sonne of GOD. Of which death of CHRIST the blame is to be layd upon our sinnes, as the meritorious cause, rather then upon those, who were but the instruments of his death. For by our sinnes we nayled CHRIST upon the Crosse; by our sinnes we pierced the pretious body of IESVS CHRIST: we are the men that crucified our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Let us therefore pray to GOD, that hee would powre upon us <hi>the spirit of grace and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10660:46"/>
the temporall plagues denounced in this world, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of eternall torments in hell?</p>
                  <p>But when these ordinary meanes of humiliation, by the ministery of the Law will not prevaile; it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God sometimes by meanes extraordinary, or at the least, not so ordinary, to draw men unto him, as it were, by a strong hand, adding to the ministery of the word, sometimes afflictions and crosses, and, sometimes terrors and anguish of conscience. By afflictions <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi> brethren were brought to acknowledge their sinne. Gen. 42.21. <hi>Manasses</hi> when he was in affliction, greatly humbled himselfe before God, 2. Chro. 33.12. so did the prodigall sonne, Luke 15.18. according to that, Es. 26.16. Hos. 5.15</p>
                  <p>By terrors also sometimes men are humbled, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Luke 5.8.9. being affrighted, when by the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous draught of fishes he was brought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the divinity of our Saviour CHRIST: much more the Iaylour, Act. 16.27.29. And most of all S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 9.6.9.</p>
                  <p>But here we must beware of an erroneous and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conceipt of some, who runne into contrary extreames. For as they imagine none to believe, who have not full assurance; so they thinke none to be humbled as they ought, or effectually called, who are not drawne, either by grievous afflictions, or by the terrors of their conscience to the brinke of despaire, as though there were no hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for them. In deed it is good for a man to be much humbled in himselfe, and as <note n="y" place="margin">Iob 42.6.</note>
                     <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh, to <hi>abhorre himselfe</hi> repenting <hi>in dust and ashes,</hi> and to acknowledge that in him selfe, or by his owne meanes, there is no hope of salvation. But it is either great

ignorance or forgetfulnes of CHRIST, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no meanes whereby to be saved; or if a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge CHRIST, it is great infidelity to thinke that his sinnes, which are but finite (though many and great,) are more and greater then the mercies of God, and merits of CHRIST, which are infinite. Therefore so to be humbled is a fearefull sinne, and perhaps a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sinne, then any for which he is humbled. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this may be said for the comfort and profit of those whom God doth draw by a strong hand, that is, by grievous afflictions, either outward, or inward, (which are in deed the most grievous; for a wounded <note n="z" place="margin">Pro. 19.14.

                  <p>For their profit: they are to be advised, that when they are afflicted either outwardly, or inwardly, they would first acknowledge the hand of God, by what meanes soever the affliction doth happen unto them, and not to seeke to remove the hand of God afflicting them; if outwardly, by indirect or unlawfull meanes; if inwardly, by worldly and carnall delights; but to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that the end which God propoundeth in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may be atchieved. 2. that they would humble themselves under the mightie hand of God, whom they have provoked to anger against them; labouring to call to minde their sinnes, whereby they have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God; to confesse them particularly, to bewaile them, and to be sory for them, because by them they have displeased God, and pierced our Saviour: earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>But, as I said, ordinarily the Lord worketh humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the ministery of the law.

                     <hi>every one that doth not continue in all the things which are written in the looke of the law to doe them,</hi> to be true, but also to apply it to our selves; after this maner; seeing this is most true, as being the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted word of God, that every man in himselfe is subject to the fearefull curse of God both in this life, &amp; in the world to come, who doth not performe the three degrees of obedience contayned in this sentence; that is, to <hi>Doe</hi> the things commaunded, to doe them <hi>all,</hi> and to <hi>continue</hi> in doing all; therefore it cannot be denyed, but that in my selfe I am most accursed; who to the not performing of these three degrees of obedience, have added the three contrary degrees of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For I have not onely not done the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, but also I haued done the things forbidden: I have not onely not kept all Gods commaundements, but also I have broken them all: I have not onely not continued in perpetuall obedience, but I have also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in a perpetuall course of disobedience.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10660:48"/>
men come to see and acknowledge their owne damnable estate in themselves; whereby they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to seek for salvation out of themselves in CHRIST; especially, if to the application of the sentence of the law, they adioyne a serious consideration of the day of judgment (which the Apostle calleth <note n="c" place="margin">

                  <p>And as touching the latter; the Holy Ghost having opened our hearts to receive CHRIST, by a true, willing, and lively assent (which is the condition of the promise:) he teacheth us to apply the promise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our selves, as belonging to us.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore three things are to be done. 1. we are to believe in CHRIST by a lively assent to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Gospell. 2. so believing in CHRIST, we are to apply the promises of the Gospell to our selves. 3. having by application attayned to some assurance, we must give all diligence that this assurance may

more and more be encreased.</p>
                  <p>As touching the first: we must be very carefull, that our assent to the doctrine of the Gospell, promising salvation to all that believe in CHRIST, be <hi>willing, true, lively,</hi> and <hi>effectuall.</hi> otherwise, though we may believe, that IESVS the sonne of the blessed Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is the Sonne of GOD, and Saviour of all that shalbe saved (which not onely hypocrites, and wicked men, but the devils themselves also after a sort believe) yet we cannot truly be said to believe in CHRIST.

For as there is a twofold knowledge, the one literall, swimming in the braine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the judgment, but not reforming the heart, &amp; the conversation, serving onely to purchase the more stripes; <note n="n" place="margin">Luke 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iohn 2.3.4. for the other, though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the object it is true, because it is the knowledge of the truth; yet it is not true formally, and in respect of the efficacy, or of the effect:) so faith, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times goeth under the name of <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,</hi> may be distinguished. For there is a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, idle, and dead faith; which, having neither <hi>root,</hi> nor <hi>fruit,</hi> is uneffectuall, either to justification or to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: which is the faith of hypocrites, and of all

For as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, when it conceiveth any thing to bee true, not by evidence of reason, but by the authority of God, speaking in his word, as in matters of faith, hath the concurrence of the will, acted by the Spirit of God, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to assent thereunto: so when the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, enlightned by the Holy Ghost, conceiveth and judgeth any thing to be good, it c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. By the second degree of faith, which some call spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall faith, the promises of the Gospell are to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                  <p>For the Gospell doth not promise justification and salvation to all, but to those onely who have a justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith.</p>
                  <p>Therfore a man must be indued with justifying faith, before he can or ought to apply the promises of the Gospell to himselfe.

                  <p>But say I, if no other justifying faith be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, but the speciall faith whereby we are assured of the remission of our sinnes: and if this also be true (which the Scripture teacheth) that by faith we are to obtaine remission of sinnes; that absurdity will necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow, which he so much disclaimeth. For to hold that the sinnes of those who are <hi>adulti,</hi> or come to yeares of discretion, be forgiven before they doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is as great an absurdity as the other; because by faith we obtayne remission of sinnes, neither is remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promised to any, who are of yeares, but onely to those that believe.</p>
                  <p>Of necessity therefore we must hold this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith, viz: that there is one degree of justifying faith, which in order of nature, goeth before remission of sinnes, by which we obtayne forgivenes of sinnes, &amp; by which we are justified before God: and that there is an other degree of justifying faith, which followeth after justification and remission of sinnes: whereby we being perswaded, and in some measure assured of the remission of our sinnes, are justified in the court of our owne conscience. And of this indeed it is true, that our
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10660:52"/>
sinnes be forgiven, before we believe or be assured that they be forgiven.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For the further clearing of this distinction of Faith, let us distinctly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the differences betweene the two degrees; for 1. by the former, as I have said, we are justified before God in the Court of Heaven, by the latter, we are justified in the Court of our owne conscience: by the former, wee are justified properly; by the latter we are assured of our justification. 2. Of the justification, which wee have by the first degree, (which properly is called justification) there are no degrees; but of that which wee have by the second degree, which properly is not justification before GOD, but the assurance of it in our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, there are degrees according to the measure of our Faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The first degree goeth before the remission of sinnes, the second followes after.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Every man is bound upon paine of damnation to have the first degree of Faith, which is truely, &amp; firmely to believe, that IESVS the Sonne of the blessed Virgin, is the Eternall Sonne of GOD, and Saviour of all that truely believe in him; but no man ought to have the second, who hath not the first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a man must first have justifying Faith, which is the condition of the promise, before hee ought to believe, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of remission of sinnes, or of salvation belongeth to him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The former degree seemeth more properly to be the worke of the spirit regenerating us, 1. Iohn. 5.1. the latter of the same spirit, as it is the spirit of adoption, sealing us <hi>after we have believed.</hi> Eph. 1.13.4.30. Rom. 8.15.16.17.</p>

                  <p>Now, this application is made by a practicall syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the proposition whereof (which some call <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The conclusion which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict or testimony of the Holy Spirit, testifying with our spirits in the assumption, according to the word in the proposition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore I through Gods mercy shalbe saved.</hi> which is the voice of speciall Faith.</p>
                  <p>The consequence of this, and all other former syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logismes is such, that the conclusion can not bee false, if the premisses bee true. Otherwise a contradiction would be implied, that is, contradictories would be true
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10660:55"/>
together, which is impossible: For if this conclusion should be false, then either the Proposition is not true; that <hi>whosoever truly believeth in Christ, shall be saved:</hi> or the assumption, <hi>that I truly believe in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the proposition of this syllogisme, there can bee no doubt, it being the undoubted word of God, and the maine promise of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>Against the assumption, two things may be objected: the one, our of the doctrine of our Divines: the other, out of the doctrine of the Papists. For some of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, define faith to be a full assurance of the love of God concerning the remission of our sinnes, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall salvation by CHRIST: or in other words to the like effect. But the faith mentioned in the assumption is no such assurance.</p>
                  <p>I answere, that our Divines, defining the speciall Faith, are not to be blamed for defining it according to the perfection thereof; for so every vertue and grace ought to be defined; that so we may learne not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selves with that imperfect measure whereunto we have already attayned, but may aspire towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But if any shall hereupon inferre, that no man doth truly believe, who hath not that full assurance (as some vnadvisedly have done) he shall give occasion to the greatest part of believers, either to <hi>despaire,</hi> that they have not Faith, because they have not full assurance; or because they would not be thought without Faith to <hi>presume</hi> that they have a full assurance: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing men doe not attayne unto at the first, nor at once, but by divers degrees, after much practice of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and long experience of Gods goodnes towards them; and never is so fully obtayned before the end of this life, but that somewhat still may, and ought
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10660:55"/>
to be added to it.</p>
                  <p>The objection of the Papist against the assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that a man doth not know, that he doth believe; and therefore not being assured, that he doth believe, he can have no assurance of salvation. This is in deed the thing which they must stand unto, if they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as they doe, the certainty of salvation. For if a man may be assured, that he doth truly believe, he may also be assured that he shalbe saved.</p>
                  <p>But that the faithfull may know, that they believe, I prove,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because every believer is taught to say, <hi>I believe in God the Father, I believe</hi> in God the Sonne, <hi>I believe</hi> in God the Holy Ghost.

                     </gap> or verdict of speciall Faith, concluding the certainty of salvation, by application of the promises to him that hath the first degree of of faith. Which in my poore opinion is a most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable doctrine.</p>
                  <p>But against speciall Faith so proved, the Papists still object diverts things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it cannot be truly termed faith, and that for three reasons. For 1. <hi>verae fidei falsum subesse non potest,</hi> the object of true faith cannot be that which is false. but of this, the object may be false, because a man may be deceived in the application.</p>
                  <p>I answere: as there is a double knowledge, the one of principles manifest in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves, called <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> so there is a twofold Faith, the one of principles contayned in the word of God; the other, of conclusions deduced from thence: which conclusions though they are not absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, yet the premisses being true, they cannot be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10660:57"/>
false. But the premisses of this practicall syllogisme made by a faithfull man, are true; therefore the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion cannot be false. Indeed if the syllogisme be made by an hypocrite, or unsound, or ungrounded Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, the conclusion is not necessary; because the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is false, or at the least, uncertaine: false, if he doe not believe; uncertaine, if he doe not know himselfe to believe; and then the assumption at the most, is but this; but I doe suppose that I doe believe; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion must be answerable, therefore I suppose that I shalbe saved.

                  <p n="2">2. True Faith is grounded upon the Word, the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Faith that this man or that man shall be saved, is not grounded on the Word. <hi>ergo,</hi> it is not a true Faith.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. The third absurdity which the Papists put upon the doctrine of speciall Faith, is, that by it men are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to commit all manner of sinne.

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> That which they say of sinne to come, is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious sclander, as I noted before; but I answere: the practice of sinne (especially of any crime) and going on in the same without repentance, cannot possibly stand with the assurance of Faith. Neither can a man be assured of the forgivenes of any sinne, whereof hee doth not repent: and much lesse can he be assured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand of the forgivenes of that sinne which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously he doth purpose to commit.</p>

For as I have shewed before, the more a man is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of GODS love towards him in CHRIST, in forgiving his sinnes, and giving unto him eternall life; the more will his heart be inflamed with love towards GOD, and towards his neighbour for GODS sake; the more zelous will he be of GODS glory, the more thankfull for his mercies, the more desirous to please, the more fearefull to displease, the more carefull to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, the more ready when he hath offended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto him. &amp;c. and therefore not without cause, <hi>chasidim</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Having thus by application of the promises to our selves (as having the condition thereof) attayned to some measure of assurance, we are to be carefull to use all other meanes, which GOD hath ordayned, for the confirming of this assurance.</p>
                  <p>The first meanes is prayer, both for the spirit of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option, and for the encrease of our Faith.</p>
                  <p>As touching the former: forasmuch as speciall Faith is the worke of the Holy Ghost, shedding abroad the love of GOD in our hearts; we are therefore to entreat the Lord that he would give us his Spirit (which hee hath promised to give to those that aske him Luk. 11.13.) the spirit of adoption, crying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, by whom we cry in our hearts Abba Father.

                  <p>And as for the other: because full assurance is the highest degree of speciall faith, unto which we doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so fully attayne, but that still more and more may and ought to be added; therfore we are to pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually for the increase thereof, saying with the father of the Daemoniack Mark. 9.24. <hi>I believe Lord, but helpe thou my unbeliefe,</hi> and with the Apostles, Luk. 17.5. <hi>O Lord increase our faith.</hi> For as Augustine <note n="l" place="margin">De <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="2">2. Secondly the necessity of uprightnes is proved by the authority of God speaking in the scriptures as 1 By the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God imposing a necessity of duety

Sam. 16, 7. and according to the quality and disposition of the heart, he judgeth of the man.

only our words &amp; deeds, but also our inward thoughts and affections to God, who not onely knoweth the heart, but especially looketh to the heart. It is the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which <hi>David</hi> vseth to move <hi>Solomon</hi> to upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. 1.

If therfore we could truly and effectually believe, and remember this, (which is a most certaine and vndoubted truth, and no lesse certaine then that there is a God, which of all truthes is the most certaine truth) we would abstaine from sinne, neither would we be so shamelesse, as in his sight, and in his presence to sinne against him, see Iob. 31.4.34.21.

Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they desire to please men, and to approve them selves to them rather then to God? And why doe they seeke to please men, rather then God? is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they feare men, more then God, or trust in men more then in God? But if we did effectually acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gods all sufficiency, we would learne to feare him, and to trust in him above all; knowing that no creature is able, either to doe vs good, vnlesse God vse him as his instrument for our good: or to hurt vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse God use him as his rodde to scourge vs, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we would feare him, and trust in him rather then in his instruments; so would we labour to please him above all.</p>

                  <p>But it is the fashion of hypocrites to sever these two, which God hath so unseparably linked together, that whosoever hath the one in truth, hath also the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and whosoever hath not both, hath neither.

                  <p>To serve God therfore in righteousnes before him, is in the dueties which we performe to men, to behave our selves as in the sight and presence of God; not in dissimulation and guile, not with an heart and an heart that is a double heart, not with fayning or disguising, but in integrity, sincerity &amp; truth, with simplicity and singlenes of heart. which you are to vnderstand, not that simple men are to be fooles, but that wise men are to be simple; or as the Apostle exhorteth. <hi>wise to that which is good, and simple concerning evill.</hi> Rom. 16.19. or as he speaketh 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>And thus we are to serve God in righteousnes <hi>before him.</hi> For howsoever wordly policie, which is mixt with dissimulation and guile, be commonly practised and highly extolled among men, and simplicity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise neglected and contemned, as folly; yet by the testimony of the Holy Ghost, true wisdome which descendeth from above, as all good gifts doe, is not mixed with dissimulation Iam. 3.17. but is tempered with simplicity, as our Saviour teacheth his followers.

                  <p>Those therfore that will be wise in Gods accompt, must be content to seeme fooles in the estimation of

the world. 1. Cor. 3.18. As for that wisdome which is mixed with deceipt, the Holy Ghost doth censure it, as <hi>earthly, carnall, and devillish</hi> Iam. 3.15.

For by generation the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> is actually communicated to all his posterity; and no sooner are they partakers of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, then they doe participate in his sinne. But we may not say, that the righteousnes or obedience of Christ is communicated to all from their beginning, but onely (I speake after the maner of the scriptures, of those which are <hi>adulti</hi>) to those that believe. Neither are they in their generation, or before, made partakers of Christs righteousnes, but in their <hi>regeneration.</hi> That no man therfore should neglect the benefit of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as though he had already obtayned it, before his conversion or effectuall calling, or regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in which faith is ingenerated by the Holy Ghost in the soules of the elect; he speaketh in the future tense; that men should understand, that they are not borne just or justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but that they shalbe justified, so soone as they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto God, shall believe in Christ, and that they are just, <hi>non nati, sed renati,</hi> not borne, but borne anew, Wherfore before we ought to presume that we are jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, we must be called, converted, regenerated.

and no other hath he justified. Rom. 8.30.</p>
                  <p>Thus then we are to conceive of Christs merits, and the benifits which we have thereby: that howsoever our Saviour CHRIST did in the dayes of his flesh me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriously redeeme and save men, paying a price of ransome sufficient for all, and fully satisfying the jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of GOD in the behalfe of all that shalbe saved: yet notwithstanding none are actually redeemed, or recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, or justified, but they onely to whom the merits of Christ are applyed; and they are applyed onely to those that believe (I speak of those which are <hi>adulti,</hi> for to elect infants, dying in their infancy, they are applyed by the Holy Ghost) Neither can any be assured that they truely believe, but such as repent of their sinnes, and make conscience of their wayes.</p>
                  <p>This learned man therfore should have distinguished betweene the merit of redemption, and actuall rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: even as well as betweene the merit of salvation, and the actuall profession thereof: Christ merited our redemption, and salvation long since; yea his merit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hat ever bene in force since the beginning <note n="o" place="margin">Apos 13.8.</note> of the world: but yet none are actually made partakers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, but such as to whom it is applyed, that is to those that truly believe. for they onely receive it, and to them onely, according to the covenant of grace it was intended. Otherwise, he might say, that all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are naturally saved, for whom Christ purchased e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life; who notwithstanding are not saved, so much as in hope, untill they doe truly believe. And if all the elect be actually justified before God, because Christ did merit their justificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why doth he not say in like manner, that all the elect are actually sanctified: seeing Christ was made unto us of God, not onely righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,

And what was their Faith, which was confirmed by hearing him selfe? that <hi>this is indeed the Christ the Saviour of the world.</hi> And this, as I said, is the ordinary signification of the phrase in the New Testament. see Iohn 7.31. 8.30.31.33. 11.26.27. Act. 8.37. so the Hebrew, is joyned with beliefe, not onely in God, but in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets also; not that we are to put affiance in them, but to give credit to them as to the messengers of God, Ex. 14 31. 2. Chro. 20.20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The second act is of applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when believing truly that he is the Saviour of all that believe, I therfore believe that he is my Saviour: which is the act of that special faith, by which we are justified in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> sence the phrase seems to be used 1.

                  <p>The third act is of affiance, that because I doe believe not onely that he is the Saviour of the world, but also my Savior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therfore I rest upon him for salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; thus Ioh. 14.1. But this is not the act of faith, as it justifieth us before God, nor yet the proper act of the speciall faith, which doth justifie us in our conscience, but
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:10660:110"/>
a fruite and consequent thereof. For if I truly believe that Christ is the Saviour of all that believe, then must I consequently believe that he is my Saviour, (for the generall alwayes includes the particulars) and if I doe truely believe that he is my Saviour, then shall I conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly put my trust in him for salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Or more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to use his owne termes; he saith, <hi>that the proper act of faith, as it justifieth, consisteth in trust, or relyance vpon the promise for our owne particular, when the soule depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth wholly, or trusteth perfectly in the promise, for remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes, and for salvation.</hi> But say I, a man cannot at all, and much lesse wholly and perfectly trust in the promise to be performed to himselfe, unlesse he be first perswaded, and in some measure assured, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise doth belong unto him selfe, which perswasion is the act of speciall Faith. A man cannot be assured at all, that the promise belongeth to himselfe, unlesse he have the condition of the promise, which is a true justifying faith. for the promise is not made to all, but to those that truly believe. Therefore I must have a justifying Faith, which is the condition of the promise before I can be assured that the promise belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to me. I must be perswaded that it belongeth to me; before I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently trust that it shalbe performed to me.</p>

But miserable comforters are they, who reach (as this man doth not) that where is not full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, there is no faith. But if we desire to minister true comfort to the distressed conscience perplexed with doubtings concerning faith; we must unteach these doctrines, either that justifying faith is an assurance of remission, and much lesse a full assurance; or that it is affiance, much lesse a full affiance, trusting wholly to the promise for the performance of it to a mans selfe; which cannot be had, unlesse thou hast the like assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the promise doth belong to thee.

But aske him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, dost thou truly believe, that Iesus the sonne of the blessed Virgine is the eternall sonne of God and Saviour of all that truly believe in him? If he say he doth so, tell him then thou hast the condition of the promise, therfore thou maist, and thou must undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly conclude, that he is thy Saviour, and that thou shalt be saved by him. If he say, he doubteth, whether he doth truly believe, that CHRIST is the Saviour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many say they believe, who do not truly believe. Aske him againe, dost thou believe that in thy selfe and by nature thou art no better then a firebrand of hell, a vassall of sinne and Sathan, subject to eternall death and damnation? To this no doubt he will say, Yes. say then it seemeth you believe the sentence of the law concluding you under the curse, but doe you not also believe the Gospell, that notwithstanding the guilt of your owne conscience accusing, and the sentence of the law condemning you, you shalbe blessed, if you believe in Christ? this also, if he have any grace, he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, as being the expresse doctrine of the Gospell, Aske him then, is there any other meanes, whereby you may hope to be saved, but by Christ? he will say, he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all other meanes, well then, you acknowledg (you may say) that in your selfe you are a wretched sinner, but yet notwithstanding by Christ you shall be happy, if you shall believe in him, tell me then, have not you earnestly desired to come out of that damnable estate,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:10660:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wherein you were by nature, and to be partaker of that happines purchased by Christ for all that believe in him? he will say he hath, and that he hath often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed this his desire by hearty prayer. But you belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (may you say) and desiring those things, have you not also resolued to acknowledge and professe CHRIST to be the onely Saviour, and to rest upon him alone for salvation, renouncing all other meanes, and to acknowledge him to be your Lord, &amp; therefore to obey him, and serve him, making conscience of all your wayes? All this have I done (will he say) and yet I have not assurance, But say I, if thou hast done all this, then thou hast a true justifying faith, For to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ is to receive him and thou hast received him not onely in thy judgment by a firme and lively assent, but also in thy heart and will, by an earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and settled purpose of application, by which thou hast received him to be thy Saviour. Herevpo I inferre, that thou hast the condition of the promise, and therfore that the promise doth belong unto thee, and that thou believing truly, that Iesus is the Saviour of all that believe in him, he is thy Saviour, and therfore needest not, yea thou oughtest not to doubt of thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for by refusing to apply the promise to thy selfe, when thou hast the condition thereof, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest God a lyar. 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>If any man imagine, that this conclusion doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict mine assertion, affirming such an assent, as I have spoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he must understand, that I speake not of a bare assent to whatsoever God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth unto us; but the asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t must be thus qualified. First it must be a willing, or voluntary assent. For the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing whereof, we must know, that whatsoever the understanding conceiveth and judgeth to be true and good, that the will doth receive as true and good; for for the will is <hi>intellec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us extensus,</hi> And such is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall harmony betweene the understanding and the will
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:10660:117"/>
that as the will followeth the judgment and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the practicke understanding; so the will having received for true and good, that which the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hath so conceived, the minde or the reasonable soule doth both assent to it as true, and approve it as good. so that the assent and approbation of the minde is an act both of the understanding and of the will. But how the will, which naturally followeth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irection of the understanding, should (as he speaketh) command the understanding to assent or approve, I doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. But on the contrary, I suppose, that the minde many times doth assent, not onely without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, but also without the consent of the will: as namely, when the understanding of a man or devill, doth know a thing to be true, but doth not conceive it to be good, but hurtfull and pernicious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. That there is a God who is the Iudge of the world, that this God is just, that he hath prepared hell for the wicked: the devills, and wicked men doe conceive and know to be true, and because they cannot d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ny it, they doe acknowledge, and after a sort assent unto it: but yet this truth they doe abhorre, and with horrour they doe believe it, Iam. 2.19. The legion of devils did know our Saviour CHRIST, and confesse bim to be the Sonne of God, but with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, fearing lest he came to torment them before their time, Mark 8.29. so that the wicked, both men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels doe many times believe that, which they doe not willingly assent unto, but abhorre, and wish it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. But the faith of Gods children is a willing assent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a true, lively and effectuall assent. For in Divinity we are said to believe, and by Faith
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:10660:118"/>
to know no more then we believe effectually, &amp; know by a lively faith. Now where there is a true, lively, and effectuall faith, it worketh a disposition in us answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that which we believe and know. The wicked doe believe after a sort, that there is a God, that he is just, and good, that he is infinite in essence, power and wisdome, &amp;c. that IESVS the Sonne of the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, is the Saviour of the world, &amp;c. yet none of all this doe they truely and effectually believe. For if they did believe in deed, that there is a GOD, they would not deny him in their deeds, behaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as if there were no God. If they did truly believe that he is good, yea goodnes it selfe, they would love him; if just, they would feare him; if omnipresent, they would walke before him; if omnipotent or all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient, they would either trust in him, or feare him, if omniscient, they would not play the hypocrites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. If they did truly believe, that IESVS is the Saviour, they would desire to be made partakers of his merits, they would be carefull to apply them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they would rest upon him for salvation, they would obey and serve him as their Lord. But he that saith he knoweth him, that is, believeth in him, and hath no desire nor care to keepe his commandements, <note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 2.4.</note>

                  <p>These things thus premised, I come to his argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and first to the proposition, which if it were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally true, as it is propounded <hi>(whatsoever the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by the onely light of Nature judgeth to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest; that the will can desire by the onely strength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)</hi> then might I as lawfully assume, and conclude thus, to the great comfort of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi> (whom in divers other points he doth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily oppose.)

                     </gap> onely as true in his word, but also as faithfull in his promises; and consequently to trust in him, for the performance thereof, likewise to obey God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding us any duety, as namely to turne unto him by unfained repentance, and to lay holde upon CHRIST by a true faith; therefore by the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strength of nature, the will may desire or will any of these acts, namely to turne unto God by unfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to lay hold upon CHRIST by a true faith to trust unto God for the performance of his promises to us, which in his conceipt, is the very act of Faith, as it justifieth.</p>
                  <p>I come to the assumption: where, I confesse, in a confused generality, the understanding, by the onely light of nature, judgeth it an honest and good thing to believe what God revealeth indefinitely, but when you come to the particular object of justifying Faith, viz.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:10660:119"/>
that IESVS CHRIST is the Sonne of GOD, and Saviour of all that believe in him; this ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will deny to be revealed by GOD; as to the Iewes the preaching of <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.23.</note>of CHRIST cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified was a <hi>stumbling blocke,</hi> and to the Greekes <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes:</hi> or if they doe give a kinde of assent unto it, yet they neither doe nor can believe it by a lively and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall assent.</p>
                  <p>His second reason. <hi>That is no ast of justifying faith which is found in devils, heretickes, hypocrites and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But this assent to divine revelations; because of Gods authority, is to be found in devils, hereticks, hypocrites, and reprobates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore this assent is no act of justifying faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The proposition is not universally true: for so much of faith as is found in the wicked, either men or Angels, is common to them with the faithfull and elect, and without it there can be no faith. if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore justifying Faith doe assent to divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, because of GODS authority, and there can be no justifying faith without this assent; then it followeth, that to assent is an act of justifying faith.</p>
                  <p>But I answere to the assumption, that this assent (meaning a willing, lively, and effectuall assent to the truth of God in Christ) is not to be found in devils, whose assent is not so much as willing, but with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, even to that which they abhorre, as himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth; not in hereticks, who as they are hereticks, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the truth. For though that assertion of the Papist, that any one act of infidelity bereaveth a man of faith, be wicked and desperate; yet this is true,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:10660:119"/>
that howsoever the proper object of faith, as it justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is Christ: notwithstanding by the same faith by the which we are justified, we believe, not onely all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther articles of the Christian faith, but also <note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 11.3. &amp;c</note>whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God hath revealed in his word: and whosoever doth refuse to believe whatsoever God hath revealed in his word, he hath not a true faith.

                     </gap> because they propound it as a destinction of a true justifying faith, when as it is not possible, that that faith which wanteth his forme, &amp; which is dead, and therefore hath not his true being, should ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify: neither is it possible, that that faith should be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which is called <hi>actus pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Secondly, because the Papists in this distinction imply, that charity is the forme of faith, and as it were the soule thereof, which they seeme to ground on <hi>Iames 2.26.</hi> for how can one habite be the forme of an other, especially such an habite, as is the fruit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of the other? for charity which is the end of the <note n="q" place="margin">1.

For when wee are by faith perswaded of GODS love towards us in CHRIST, then are we moved to love GOD, and our neighbour for GODS sake, and the more we are assured of GODS love, the more is our heart inflamed with fervent love towards GGD, as I have shewed.

For as knowledge is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished into a literall and spirituall knowledge, the literall being onely a meere speculative knowledge, swimming in the braine, and not working upon the heart, informing onely the understanding, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the heart, or the conversation, the spirituall, being an operative or powerfull knowledge, not onely informing the judgment, but also reforming the heart, and conforming the whole man to that which he knoweth, which in divinity is alone accoumpted the true knowledge, for he <hi>that sayeth he knoweth God</hi>

                  <p>And to the branches of this distinction is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer distinction to be applyed; For the generall or dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall faith is either a lively and effectuall faith, which is a saving acknowledgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the truth, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a sort the justifying faith, (so farre forth as it is a lively assent) and is proper to the elect, or els it is but a dead faith and uneffectuall, which is called a bare historicall faith: and is, common not onely to wicked men, but also to the devills.<note n="d" place="margin">Iam. 2.19.</note> So the legall faith, is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lively and effectuall, when as a man not onely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to the truth of the legall threatnings,<note place="margin">The legal faith</note> but also applying them to himselfe, is thereby humbled.

                  <p>The act of faith requisite to justification, is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or receive Christ, who is our righteousnes; which is done, first, by a lively assent to the promises of the Gospell and then by speciall application of them to a mans selfe, for where this lively assent is, that Iesus the sonne of the blessed virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is the eternall sonne of GOD, and Saviour of all those that believe in him; there Christ is received, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the judgment, by that lively assent but also in the heart and affections by an earnest desire to be made partaker of him, and of his merits and righteousnes, and in the will by an vnfained reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to acknowledge him to be our Saviour, and to rest vpon him for salvation.

This apprehension of Christ, first by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and then by application, is the very roote of faith, whereby we receive from Christ spirituall life to our justification, and salvation; and where this roote is wanting, as Luk. 8.13. there is no true justifying faith, or communion with Christ. For although the Role of Christs righteousnes be that wedding garment which cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though the merites and sufferings of Christ be a soveraigne salve to cure our spirituall maladies; yet they will not heale us, unlesse they be applyed: they are applyed by this apprehensive faith, though the body of Christ be meat in deed, and and his bloud drinke in deed, to nourish us unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life; yet they will not nourish us, unlesse we eat his body and drinke his blood: his body is eaten, and his blood drunke by this apprehensive and special faith. They therefore who professe themselves to believe in Christ, and yet doe not by faith apprehend, that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, and apply him to themselves, they have not a justifying faith. for faith doth justifie, not in respect of it owne worth, or as it is a grace inherent in us: but as it apprehendeth and receiveth, or at least is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive of Christ, who is our righteousnes. And such is the faith of all hypocrites, who professe them selves to believe, and yet neither apprehend, nor so much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to apprehend and apply Cheist &amp; his merites unto them selves; but suffer, as much as in them lyeth, the precious blood of Christ to be spilt in vaine; as it is in vaine to them to whom it is not applyed. And such hypocrites are all Papists, who professing them selves

Hence it is, that the believers sinne, for which christ shed his blood, is to him veniall, and the unbelievers sinne, to whom CHRISTS merits are not imputed, is to him mortall.</p>

And if not the flesh, then not the <hi>will</hi> of the flesh; for in our regeneration our will especially is renewed and changed. For howsoever some doe teach, that a regenerate man may will his falling away, and that he may fall away, if he will, there being no such perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance granted to men, but that of their owne accord they may fall away: unto which error of the <hi>semipela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> some of late have added a strange conceipt: that in the regenerate man there is the spirit and the flesh, and the <hi>will set betweene both,</hi> which sometimes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the spirit, and sometimes the flesh, and this will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mutable, our estate in grace is mutable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore howsoever GOD doth not forsake the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet they may of their owne accord fall from GOD.</p>
                  <p>But hereunto I answeare, 1. that the will of a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man is also regenerated; and is therefore partly spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and partly flesh, willing that which is good, as it is spirit, and nilling it as it is flesh: willing that which is evill, as it is flesh, and nilling it as it is spirit; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene these two there is such a conflict <note n="r" place="margin">Gal 5 17.</note> that a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man cannot will with his full will, either that which is evill, or that which is good, And therefore as his good actions are stained with the flesh; so his sinnefull actions are sinnes of infirmity, as being done against his will and purpose, as he is a man regenerate.</p>

                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:10660:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. That our perseverance doth not depend upon our owne will, though regenerate, being left to it selfe, and much lesse upon the will of our flesh, or upon our owne strength; but upon the eternall love of God, from which no creature, and therefore not our owne will shalbe able to seperate us, and upon the immutable will and infinite power of GOD, who is both able and willing to stablish us, as hath beene said.

                  <p n="3">3. That to them, who are regenerate a constant will to persevere is partly given by the spirit in their regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and continued by the assisting grace of the spirit in performance of the particular acts of sanctification; and partly procured by our Saviours intercession. For as touching the former, in our regeneration our will is renewed, seriously and constantly to will our salvation and perseverance thereunto &amp; in the continued course of our sanctification we are assisted by the spirit to will and to doe good, and to resist evill, For as <hi>St. Augustine</hi> testifieth <note n="t" place="margin">De corrept &amp; gratia c. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>God to his saints doth give, not onely such an helpe as he gave to the first man, without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not persevere, if they will; but also he worketh in them to will; that because they shall not persevere, unlesse they both can and will, the power and will to persevere should be

For so greatly is their will inflamed by the holy Ghost, that therefore they can, because they so will, therefore they so will, because God worketh that they will. For in so great infirmity of this life, in which infirmity notwithstanding for the repressing of pride, virtue was to be perfected; if their will were left to them selves, that in the helpe of GOD, without which they cannot persevere, they might abide if they would, &amp; GOD should not worke in them, that they would: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so many &amp; so great temptations, the will it selfe by its infirmity would faile; &amp; therefore they could not persevere, because failing through infirmity, they would not so much as will, or would not so will, by reason of the weaknes of the will, as that they could.</hi>

                  <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> deceiveth himselfe, whiles he seeketh to deceive others. For when we say that faith alone doth justify, our meaning is that we are not justified by any righteousnes inherent in our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Answ. to his Assumption.</note>§. 3. But if the Prophet should speak of him that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous before God, I would answeare, that the assumption is false: which as it is plainly contradicted by other places of scripture, so can it not be proved out of this text. The assumption, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> fasly groundeth on this text, affirmeth, which the text doth nor affirme, that a man truly just may be turned away from his righteousnes, meaning thereby a totall and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall apostasy. for of such a defection the Prophet speaketh. Of a totall. V. 24. <hi>If the righteous turne away from his righteousnes and commit iniquity, and doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all the abominations of the wicked, he shall not live, but die therein.</hi> Of a finall v. 26. <hi>when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousnes, and commiteth iniquity, and dyeth in them</hi> (without repentance) <hi>for his iniquity, that he hath done, he shall dye.</hi> his finall impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency shalbe punished with eternall death. Now this assertion, as I said, is plainly contradicted by other testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:10660:173"/>
of scripture, as namely, Ps. 15.5.112.3.6.9. where it is said, that the righteous shall never be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, &amp; that his righteousnes remaineth for ever, &amp; that it shalbe had in everlasting remembrance; &amp; by al those evident places, which I produced before. And therefore <hi>Bellarmines</hi> exposition of this place, is not agreeable to the analogy of faith. Neither can this assumption be grounded on this text. For if the Prophet do speake of him that is truly just, then is the proposition indeed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the text, if a righteous man doe turne away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his righteousnes he shal not only loose his justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but also finally perish. But the assumption is of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi> own coyning. For the Prophet doth not say in a simple or categorical proposition, the righteous man do that any time turne away from his righteousnes; but in a connexive or conditional proposition: <hi>if the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous turne himself fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his righteousnes, &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous shal turne himself fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his righteousnes.</hi> for a sentence wherin is relation of time, is all one with a connexive or conditional propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the vulgar translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reads both waies, v. 24. si avetterit se justus, <hi>if the righteous shal turne away.</hi> v. 26. quu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> averterit se justus, <hi>when the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shal turne away.</hi> Now in a connexive or conditional speech the antecedent is not absolutely or simply affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; therfore from it, in a connexive syllogisme, we do somtimes conclude the contradictory of the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent by denying the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequent, as wel as by assuming the antecedent, we conclude the consequent. Neither have we in judging of the truth of a connexive proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, respect to the truth of the parts therof, but to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the connexion; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> may be true &amp; necessary where both the parts be false. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. If an elect man doe fall away utterly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grace, he shal perish in his sins, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is necessary, &amp; yet both parts are false in
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:10660:174"/>
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne judgment. So when the Prophet saith, if a man truly just turne from his righteousnes, he shall die or perish in his sinnes; he doth not affirme, either that he who is truly righteous, doth turne away from his righteousnes, or that he shall dye in his sins. But this he saith by way of supposition, <hi>if the</hi> righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or <hi>when the</hi> righteous shall turne away, then he shall dye in his sinnes. But from this proposition we may, or rather must inferre more agreeably to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, the very contrary conclusion. For if a man will argue from a con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>exive proposition, whereof the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts be false, he may not conclude by assuming the antecedent, but by denying the consequent: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all whereof will conclude the antecedent to be false. Thus, <hi>if any of the elect should utterly fall away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grace, he should perish in his sins; but none of the elect doth at any time perish in his sinnes; therfore none of the elect doth at any time utterly fall away from grace.</hi> In like maner, If a man truly righteous (as no man is, that is not elect) shal turne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his righteousnes, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit iniquity, according to all the abominations of the wicked: then his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes shall not be remembred; but he shall dye in his sins; but the righteousnes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which be truly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, endureth for ever, and shalbe had in everlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and he that is truly righteous, shall never be removed; therefore the man that is truly righteous doth never turne him self wholly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his righteousnes.</p>
                  <p>These words therfore of the Prophet are not a simple or absolute assertion, that the man who is truly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, shall or may fall away, but an wholsome &amp; profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table admonition to all that are, or seeme to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that they do not fall away for if they do, the Lord threatneth that their former righteousnes (which by their defection is proved to have been counterfeit) shal
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:10660:174"/>

                  <p>Object. Why, but they are said to beleive, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word with joy. Answ. they are said to believe, not because they doe by a true justifying faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the merits of Christ, or apply the promises of the Gospell to themselves: but because they professe the doctrine of faith, assenting to it as true, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it as good, and after a sort rejoycing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; all which may happen to the reprobates, who many times professe the Gospell, and in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, and approbation thereof, for certaine tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall respects, doe rejoyce, but without any true faith in Christ, or repentance towards God. as <hi>Herod</hi> is said to have heard <note n="l" place="margin">Mark. 6.20.</note>

                        <p>Paul was a faithfull and righteous man,</p>

                  <p>The proposition (which is most false) he would prove because by this testimony it appeareth, that <hi>Paul</hi> fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> An argumentation consisting wholly of particulars as this doth, concludeth nothing. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the proposition generall, that all the Galatians did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But some did fall away, and these were never truly in Christ, or in the state of grace. and some were in Christ, and in the state of grace, and these did not fall away. Neither doth the Apostle direct his speech to every particular Galatian, as though his meaning were, that all and every of the Galatians had either falne away, or had beene in Christ, and in grace: but unto the churches <note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 1.2.</note> of Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia: wherein, as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e were many unsound christians, who were apt to fall away, and perhaps the greater part, who neither were truly engrafted into Christ, nor had beene in the state of grace; so no doubt there were also some <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> or sound christians among them, who did not fall away. For those that were sound, did not fall away, contrary to the proposition; and those Galatians which did fall away, had not beene truly in Christ, nor in the state of grace, contrary to the assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. The like objection might have beene made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the church of <hi>England</hi> in Queene <hi>Maryes</hi> dayes, which made the like revolt from Christ, and from grace, seeking to be justified, even as the Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:10660:182"/>
did, by the workes of the Law, that is by their own righteousnes and obedience, which is prescribed in the Law. And yet those which were sound did not fall away, but as many of them did seale the truth which they had professed with their bloud; so no doubt wold the rest, either have forsaken their countrey, rather then their religion, (as many did) or have undergone the fiery tryall, if God in mercy had not shortned those dayes. visible churches may be said in respect of the greater part over swaying the better, to fall away, when not one sound christian in them doth fall away.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proveth the assumption. that those Galatians which did fall away, had beene in Christ, &amp; in grace, <hi>how could they,</hi> saith he, <hi>be evacuated from Christ, &amp; fall from grace if they were never truly in Christ, and in grace?</hi> His reason is thus to be framed.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Those that are evacuated from Christ, &amp; falne from grace, have beene truly in Christ, and in grace.</p>
                     <p>The Galatians that sought justification by the works of the Law, were evacuated from Christ, and falne from grace.</p>
                     <p>Therefore those Galatians had beene truly in Christ, and in grace.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The proposition he proveth by this testimony of the Apostle. But the Apostle doth not say, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth, in a simple proposition, that some of those which have beene enlightned &amp;c. doe fall away, but in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexive or conditionall sentence; if any such doe fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it is impossible they should be reclaymed; because if any should so fall, they should sinne against the holy Ghost, crucifying againe to them selves the Sonne of GOD, and making a mocke of him. From which testimony is refuted the erroneous conceipt of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> and others, who imagine that a faithfull man may fall away by a totall Apostasie, and commit the sinne against the holy Ghost, and yet be renewed again by repentance. For where the Apostle saith, <hi>it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible they should be renewed, Bellarmine</hi> saith, it is not impossible, but a very hard and rare thing. And to the same purpose the same Apostle chap. 10.26. saith,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:10660:185"/>
                     <hi>if any sinne wilfully after they have received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, treading underfoote the sonne of God, and accoumpting the blood of the testament wherewith they were sanctified</hi> (sacramentally) <hi>an unholy thing, and despiting the spirit of grace,</hi> that there remaineth for such no more <hi>sacrifice for sinnes,</hi> (who have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their part in the sacrifice of CHRIST) <hi>but a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expectation of judgment, and violent fire, which shall devoure the adversaries.</hi> We doe therefore confesse, that if any of the faithfull and elect should thus fall away by a totall apostasie, and by sinning against the Holy Ghost, that they should never be renewed, but should perish in their sinnes. But seeing it is most certaine, that none of the faithfull or elect shall finally perish, as I have evidently proved before, and as the Apostle here doth insinuate, v. 9. (<hi>but beloved, we are perswaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speake.</hi>) therefore it is certaine that they shall never thus fall away by a totall apostasie. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the proposition, if it be understood of such gifts and graces as are peculiar to those that are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is untrue. Otherwise the assumption is meerely false. For not all are justified, that have beene any wayes enlightned, that is, that either have received any knowledge of the truth, or have beene baptized, (for so the Syriacke <note n="d" place="margin">Heb: 6, 4.</note> Interpreter, and some of the Greeke Fathers <note n="e" place="margin">Dionys Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But our questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not of reprobate Angels, but of men justified by faith, and regenerated by the spirit of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of our first parents before their fall, who then were neither regenerated by the spirit, nor justified by faith.</p>
                  <p>For they are said to be regenerated, who were before dead in sinne, &amp; they are said to be justified, who are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved from their sinnes, &amp; accepted of God as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Christ.</p>

But our persevera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as I have shewed before, is not grounded upon our owne strength, or constancy of our owne willes; but upon the promises of God, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, immutable, most true &amp; faithfull, &amp; upon the mediation and intercession of Christ our Saviour, &amp;c. which promises of God, and intercession of Christ, did not appertaine to them.</p>
                  <p>If it be demaunded, why we may not fall away,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:10660:188"/>
as well as they, seeing we fall into sinne, as well as they, I answeare, first, that Christ having satisfied for the sinnes of all the faithfull, doth now also sit at the right hand of his father, making intercession for us; that he having redeemed us, and fully satisfied for all our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, we may notwithstanding all our sinnes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into through humane frailty we doe fall, be still preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and continued in the favour of God. 1.

                  <p>Secondly, though the faithfull fall, as they did, yet they doe not fall away fall from God, as they did, for the reasons before alleadged.</p>
                  <p>If againe it be objected concerning our first parents, that they had a stronger faith, more perfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, more constant will then we have. I answere, that they had faith; but not the evangelicall justifying faith. For as yet the promise of salvation by Christ was not made, neither did they before they fell, need a redeemer. And as touching righteousnes; we are justified by 2 more perfect righteousnes then they were For they stood just before God by their owne righteousnes; but we, by the righteousnes of Christ.

Let this be the summe, that <hi>David</hi> by his sinne contracted the guilt of death and damnation: but this guiltines did not alter or change his state, viz. from the state of salvation, to the state of damnation.

For as by death is meant the guilt of death and damnation, so by eternall life, the assurance of it.

And that <hi>Solomon</hi> was truly just it may be proved by these reasons. 1. Because he was beloved of God, and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:10660:196"/>
also himselfe did love God. That <hi>God loued him,</hi> it is testified 2. Sam. 12.24.25. and to that end the Lord sent by <hi>Nathan,</hi> &amp; appointed that his name should be <hi>Iedid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, that is beloved of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he loved God, the holy Ghost beareth him wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, 1. King. 3.3. And <hi>Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because he was the child of God, according to Gods owne promise 2. Sam. 7.14. and 1. Chron. 22.10. I <hi>wilbe his father &amp; he shall be my sonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because he was a type of Christ. Ps. 72. and for his sake, whose type he was, beloved of God, for he was called <hi>Iedidjah, beloved of God, for the Lords sake.</hi> 1. Sam. 12.25.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Because he was the pen-man of the holy Ghost, in penning a good part of the canonicall scriptures, and consequently <hi>an holy man of GOD,</hi> 2. Pet. 1.20.21.</p>
                  <p>And that <hi>Solomon</hi> repented after his fall, it appeareth; first, by the booke of the preacher, which he wrote to testify his repentance. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> by the testimony of the holy Ghost, 2. Chron. 11.17. where it is reported, that the preists and Levits, and so many as feared God, separated themselves from <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and his Idolatrous church, and joyned themselves to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for they walked in the way of David and Solomon 3 yeares.</hi> whereby it appeareth, that <hi>Solomon</hi> after his fall, restored the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God; although he could not wholly abolish the idolatry, which through his owne default, and (if I may so speak) uxoriousnes, was brought into the church. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> if <hi>Solomon</hi> had not repented, he had dyed, &amp; so perished in his sinne. But this is altogether improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for the sonnes of God, are also heyres, and whom
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:10660:197"/>
he loveth in Christ he loveth to the end. 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. because the Lord promised, both to him in particular, that <hi>if he did sinne</hi> (as the Lord did foresee he would) <hi>he would chastise him as his child, but he would not take his mercy from him.</hi> 2. Sam. 7.14. and also indefinitely to the faithfull seed of <hi>David</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ps. 89.29. &amp;c.</note> Ps. 89. in which <hi>Solomon</hi> is included.</p>
                  <p>Now if <hi>Solomon</hi> did not finally perish in his sinne, but was recovered by repentance; then also it followeth, that he did not wholly fall away from God; for if he had, it had bene impossible, <note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> that he should have bene renewed by repentance, as the Apostle testifieth, But though he fell grievously, yet he did not wholy fal fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God: neither did he sinne of malice, or with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of will. He fell not wholly from God, for he abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished not Gods worship, but retained it; although out of too much love to his wiues he permitted, and, as it seemeth, allowed the practise of their severall religions: and that which was permitted or authorized by him, though not practised in his owne person, is by the LORD accoumpted his act, and he for it censured as an Idolatour.</p>
                  <p>Which may serve for a caveat to all Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not to tolerate, and much lesse to allowe or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the profession of any false or idolatrous religion within their dominions, for what is done with their leave, and by their authority, is judged their act.

The first: <hi>Whosoever committeth an act of infidelity, looseth the habit of faith, and becommeth simply unfaithfull, and an enimy of God, and guilty of eternall death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But he that hath the habit of faith may commit an act of infidelity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore he that hath the habit of faith, may loose
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:10660:202"/>
it, and become meerely unfaithfull, and an enimy of God, and guilty of eternall death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The proposition he proveth by 2 arguments first, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is agreeable to the scriptures.</hi> Secondly, <hi>because by the doctrine of his adversaryes, justifying faith is shaken of by every sinne, and the holy Ghost ejected out of the heart of the offendour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I answere, that the proposition is false, &amp; absurd, for an habit is not lost by one act, but by a privation, or a contrary habit. It were strange, if by every act of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, a man should loose all his knowledg; by every act of forgetfulnes, he should be utterly deprived of his memory, or by every act of folly be wholly bereft of wisdome &amp;c. It was an act of infidelity which <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted Num. 20.11.12. when they smote the rock twice, of <hi>Zacharias</hi> Luk 1.18.20. in not believing the Angel, of <hi>Peter,</hi> who being called by Christ to come to him upon the water, was ready to sinke, Mat. 14.30.31. But that especially was a foule act of infidelity, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he denyed his master; and yet as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe holdeth he lost not his faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is not agreable to the scriptures which teach no such desperate doctrine, as this proposition contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth where in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath set up a ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> opinion, which hold, as he saith, that by every sin faith is lost, and the spirit shaken off, as the doctrine of his adversaryes, when as those, whom he termeth his adversaryes, are adversaryes to us in this cause, as well
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:10660:202"/>
as the Papists, although not in so high a degree. For though they hold the totall defection of the faithfull, yet they deny the finall, neither are they so absurd as to affirme, that faith and the holy Ghost are lost by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sinne, but by great &amp; grievous sinnes, wilfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and such as doe wast and make havock of the conscience, and much lesse ought he to imagine us to be so absurd, as to defend the certainty of perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and yet to hold, that justifying faith is shaken off, and the Holy Ghost ejected by every sinne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I answeare; that although the nature of faith in it selfe, as it is an habit inherent in us, were such, as that by some act of infidelity it might be lost, and though we in ourselves considered, be such, as that we might fal away from grace; yet neverthelesse the perseverance of all the faithfull is certaine and sure, for it dependeth not upon the worthynes of our faith, nor yet upon our owne strength, or constancy of our owne will, but upon the immutability of the will, and counsell of God, and upon his power assisting and establishing us according to his gracious promises, and upon the meditation and intercession of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cavilleth, perhaps they will say, saith he, <hi>that it is not of the nature of faith, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth unmoveable, but that it is to be ascribed to the assistance and prouidence of God, who doth not suffer men once truly justified to fall into sinne. But if it were so, why should they say, that all the workes of the righteous are mortall sinnes? and where is this promise of GOD, that he will not suffer the just to fall into sinne? Answ.</hi> If we should hold that the righteous never fall into sinne, and yet that the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:10660:203"/>
workes of the righteous are mortall sinnes, (as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in his blinded malice chargeth us) we should shew our selves very absurd, in holding two assertions so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant the one to the other. But indeed we hold nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both. Not the former; for we acknowledge a great difference betweene falling into sinne, and falling away from God. The righteous may, and often doe fall into sin, but they never fall away from God they never sin with full consent of will, they never become serva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of sin reigning in them, they sin not unto death, as the Apostles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> doe plainly testify, Rom. 6.14. 1. Iohn 3.9.5.18. Neither do we say, that all the works of the righteous, as prayer, and almes &amp;c. are mortall sinnes. That which any of us hath said in derogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good workes, hath beene in the question of justificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when the Papists obtrude them as causes of our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in which case, we are not onely to acknowledge them defective and imperfect, not able to stand in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before God, as being stained with the flesh, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we are to abhorre them as menstruous clouts <note n="a" place="margin">

And so our booke of Common-Prayer speaketh of them, as the scriptures also teach us to speak of them that are baptized, that they are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and engrafted into the body of Christ, though perhaps they be regenerated <hi>sacramento tenus,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted onely into the body of his visible church: But this judgement of charity, is no matter of certainty, or of faith but may be deceived.</p>

                     <hi>with feare and trembling,</hi> &amp; such like, his objection would have had some shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and yet but a shew. For first, the holy Ghost in these and such like places, speaketh to the whole body of the church, in which are many unsound Christians, who though they thinke them selves to stand, yet are in danger not to fall onely, but also to fall away And therefore such admonitions are necessary in the church of God, that men may beware of the leaven of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risyes,<note n="i" place="margin">Luk 12.1.</note> 
                     <hi>which is hypocrisie</hi>; that men should take heede that they build not <hi>upon the sand,</hi> lest they be but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and temporary professors: but that they should <hi>build upon the rock,</hi> and labour to approve them selves upright and sound professours, whose faith shall never faile. Secondly, such admonitions are very profitable for the faithfull and elect. For as the Lord hath decreed, &amp; promised; that they shall persever, so he hath appointed meanes, wherby they should be kept &amp; preserved from falling away; among which meanes, these and the like exhortations, admonitions &amp; comminations are not the least. For they discover unto us our weaknes in our selves, that we may not glory in our own strength and worthines; but may be taught to rely upon the power and promises of God, and upon the mediation of our Saviour Christ. And whereas godly feare &amp; vigilancy are notable meanes to keepe us in order, and to preserve us from falling away; these admonitions serve to work in us this feare, &amp; to stir us up to vigila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, &amp; to make us shake off all carnall security, &amp; spirituall drowsines. that we may <hi>accomplish our sanctification</hi>

So that hereby the Lord performeth his promise made by the Prophet Ieremy <note n="l" place="margin">Ier 32 40.</note> that <hi>he will put his feare into our hearts that we should not depart from him.</hi> These ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions therefore are not arguments to prove, that the faithfull or elect may fall away; but so many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juments, that they shall not fall away. Neither doth the necessity of using meanes, which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the obtaining of any end, prove the possibility of missing the end, for as he hath decreed the end, so hath he preordained the meanes, God had promised <hi>Paul</hi>

So the Lord hath promised the faithfull, that they shall persevere: but unlesse they walke in the feare of GOD, they cannot continue. wherefore as the Lord hath promised perseverance as the end, so he hath promised to give us his feare, as the meanes and that we may be indued with godly feare, he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth such wholsome admonitions to be used. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such admonitions, though they argue, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of our owne weaknes, if we should be left to our selves, we might fall away; yet seeing our perseverance is not grounded upon our selves, but on the immutability power and truth of God, and on the mediation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession of Christ, they doe not prove, that we, whose perseverance is grounded upon such foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, can fall away. And to this purpose consider with me these examples. Our saviour Christ,<note n="n" place="margin">Mat, 24.4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of salvation. For the more a man is perswaded or assured of Gods eternall love towards him, the more servently he will love the Lord, and carefully obey him the more reverently will he feare him, the more serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will he set himselfe to please, and the more unwilling will he be to displease him, and the more readily, when he hath offended, will he returne unto him. Neither can there be any assurance of perseverance or salvation, as of the end, where is not a setled purpose, and unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned care to use those meanes, and to walke in that way which God hath appointed to the end. And we teach, that as the Lord hath promised to the faithfull the gift of perseverance on his part, by the continuance of his favour towards us; so for our parts, he hath promised <note n="a" place="margin">Ier. 32, 40.</note> to put <hi>his feare into our hearts, that we shall not depart from him.</hi> And further we teach, that whosoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the spirit of God, his will also is regenerate: so that he hath an unfained will, and a setled purpose, and resolution to walke before God in the obedience of his will and to make conscience of all his wayes.
