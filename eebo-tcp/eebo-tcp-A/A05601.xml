            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This I onely particularize, that Merchants may see how too too often they put their goods in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, with the like ignorant fellows, whereupon oftentimes they finde deservingly the fatall issue thereof.

               <hi>Harlem,</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> in <hi>North-Holland,</hi> I came to <hi>Leyden,</hi> a dimensions Towne, wherein there is a learned Academy, and the yeare before, (as I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of one Mr. <hi>Christian,</hi> a Printer there) there were 28000. which dyed of the Plague in a small time, and notwithstanding I found the Towne exceeding populous: Thence carrocheering to <hi>Dunhag,</hi> that wide-winged Village, and Courtly Residence of the united States, I imbarked for the Citties, <hi>Delfe, Rotterdam,</hi> and <hi>Dort,</hi> whence being mounted upon a <hi>Belgian</hi> flat-bottom'd Boate, I landed at <hi>Guttenberg,</hi> and so I pedestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally advanced three Leagues to the <hi>Scots</hi> quarter by the way of <hi>Terheyden,</hi> to see the cruell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfull defendants of <hi>Breda,</hi> environed with the mercilesse fury of the States invincible As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailants.

            <p>This Towne of <hi>Breda,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Breda.</hi>

salubrious ayre, not usuall in these places; yea, and whose Champion-face over-topping the Champaine lands about, with an admired re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, over-looketh, with a singular Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Majesty, all the neighbouring and circumja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bounds; that me thought, when I first saw it, it had an awfull and predominant aspect, both for its admirable strength, and pleasant situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Two Rivers, <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>A.</hi>
               </note>There are two little Rivers, which runne from the South, and through it, where being within its body conjoyn'd in one, they cast forth their divulgements a <hi>Dutch</hi> Mile thence, in the insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sea of <hi>Terheyden:</hi> The chiefest of which two Rivers, which then run by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> quarters, is called <hi>Marck:</hi> The other that keept his course through <hi>Grave Williams</hi> Brigade and <hi>Scots</hi> quarter, is called <hi>A.</hi> But when they kisse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>A,</hi> looseth it selfe in <hi>Marck,</hi> and resigneth its name to the Towne, whence is derived <hi>Bred-A.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath onely three Ports, toward the South <hi>Ginicken</hi> Gate, toward the West, <hi>Antwerp gate,</hi> and toward the East, North-East, the <hi>Busse-port:</hi> yet toward the North, it hath from the Castle, a private passage unto the house of pleasure, which is a quarter of a Mile without the Towne: But that Port and Bridge were onely ordayned for serving the entery and issuing of his Highnesse of <hi>Orange,</hi> and his followers.</p>
            <p>As for the construction of the Towne, it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth chiefly (not mainely) Triangular, whence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9043:6"/>
these three Ports are the three Angles of its sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionat seate, and its body North-ward, lying halfe Ovall, disbendeth East and West, two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate points.</p>
            <p>And now to come to the Fortifications,<note place="margin">The fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Breda.</hi>
               </note> it is strongly fortified, with high earthen Walles, and from them are builded fifteene Bastions or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes, round about, each counter-banding one another, side to side, and flanke to flanke, having a quadrangled distance betweene each of them, which layeth open for every severall space the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire body of the Towne-walls: whence each Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke running out with a sharpe Promontoriate face, out-braveth the adjoyning Fields, with a defencible defiance.</p>
            <p>The Walls and Bulwarks themselves are envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with a large Graffe, or Moate, being of breadth in most parts, one hundreth threescore and seven foot, and in depth eighteene; and they also hemb'd in upon the brink of the water-stank with a strong double hedge of Thornes, that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Walles from any suddaine swimming or assault.</p>
            <p>Now without this broad Ditch, at the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of every Bulwarke, lyeth a large and spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hornewarke, with two, and some with three heads, which are the chiefest strength of the strong Towne, and they also environed with deepe waters, the largenesse of each of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repugnably bee defended without five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men: And betweene them, and before each of them, lyeth a <hi>Demi-lune,</hi> or halfe Moone-worke,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9043:7"/>
and sometimes here and there in the full bosome of the maine Moate,<note place="margin">The workes without the Towne, and Moate.</note> there stand certaine <hi>Redoubts,</hi> some Triangled, and others Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangled, besides other circulary Monts, which are all compassed with unpassable Graffes: So before the head of each Hornewarke, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all these other strengths, there are sharpe-pointed Counter-scarfes, figured like the <hi>Aquile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> wings, and fixt upon the maine dry ground, which is the utmost defence of all the other workes; and betweene each and all of them, there are little narrow and low Timber-bridges to passe from one another, as necessity shall require; insomuch that the workes without, are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strength of the Fortifications within.</p>
            <p>For albeit the Bulwarks round about enjoy the Cannon, yet they, the inferiour workes, are more strictly breasted with the pouldering Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, Pike, and hand Garnads: that certainely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the best judgements of all Invaders there present, and Military Souldiers, it seemed a thing impossible to over-master that impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable place; if otherwise, the right owner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (as I may say) had not beene the chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander and Master-piece of such desperate and inexpugnable assaults, whose auspicuous fortunes hitherto, have rather followed him, than fled him: for so fortunate have beene all his attempts, that he never lay downe before a Towne, and intrenched, that hee tooke not in, and so much the more absolutely victorious, howsoever fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to disastruous Souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:9043:7"/>And now to speake of the Townes inside; it hath a most magnificke and curious Cathedrall Church,<note place="margin">The high and magnificke Steeple of <hi>Breda.</hi>
               </note> high and spacious within, and farre more glorious without; having a Steeple arising from its maine body, to such an incredible hight, that scarcely I never saw the higher. It moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth squared, with foure Coynes, and some where garnished with Galleries, and double Columnes, till it come a great way above the body of the Church; and then it gathereth in smaller and smaller, till a circular and spacious Globe over-shaddow all the inferiour dependancies: so from this <hi>Rotundo,</hi> ariseth the Steeple higher and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er againe, till another lesser Globe decore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled distances betweene both; and so to the highest top it groweth more and more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, till an exceeding high Iron-crosse, and a gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Cocke mounted thereon cover all.</p>
            <p>The Towne is a <hi>Scots</hi> Mile in length, in the middle part whereof a stately and spacious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, having extracted thence three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Streets,<note place="margin">The Streets and Castle of <hi>Breda.</hi>
               </note> answerable to the three Ports, with foure maine over-thwarting Streets, crossing from Wall to Wall the bredth thereof; besides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther narrow <hi>Contrades</hi> and backe-lanes, two whereof are in good Request. There are two other Churches in it, with two Hospitalls: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, (the great Church excepted) the Castle is most formidable and defencible, being the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Mansion, and native Birth-place of that Princely Progeny of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Nassow.</hi> It is both a Fortresse and a glorious Palace, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9043:8"/>
Court whereof is curiously decored, with a gorgeous and Royall Fabricke, and it also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning a Princely Hall, with divers Roomes, and magnificke Chambers: having thereunto annexed without the inmost Draw-bridge and utmost Court, a pleasant, spacious, and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Garden, full of sweet, savory, and fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Trees, where on some are Summer hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and banquetring roomes erected.</p>
            <p>As for the lower plots, they are fully beautified with all kinds of Flowers and Hearbs, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the old <hi>Chelfanian</hi> Paradise, brought me in remembrance of these two incomparable Gardens of <hi>Pretolino,</hi> neare to <hi>Florence,</hi> and of <hi>Pau</hi> in <hi>Bierne,</hi> where <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>fourth</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was borne.

            <p>This Towne and Baronry of <hi>Breda,</hi> with the lands of <hi>Leck, &amp;c.</hi> were annexed to the house of <hi>Nassow, Anno</hi> 1404. even then when Count

            <p>And so it againe continued under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Spaine,</hi> till in the yeere 159. the fourth of <hi>March,</hi> that one Captaine <hi>Heraugier,</hi> under the government and command of his late excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence <hi>Count Maurice,</hi> by the meanes of a service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ship to the Castle, loaden with Earth-fewell, under the which he, and some fifty chosen Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were <hi>nasconded,</hi> and so by which Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem it was in the Night couragiously recovered againe from the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>

rankes of them, flying in the ayre like <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian Eagles</hi> in a Randon; that they were inforced to seeke shelterage under Hedges, Thickets, and cloudy Groves.

            <p>Well, the Cardinall and <hi>Grave Iohn</hi> stayed fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes without,<note place="margin">The Cardinal and <hi>Grave Iohn</hi> attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to relieve <hi>Breda.</hi>

In all which time the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> might make no approaches to the Towne; for having the halfe of his Army ever in Armes along the Trenches, he had not onely the Enemy without to resist, but also the Enemy within to gaine-stand; which continually vext the quarters about, with Cannon from the walls, but to no great dammage, save onely some acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall blowes, and they very few. And yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> within, with these long roaving shots spent a great deale of Powder and Bullets, which in the end, the selfe same excesse became the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest cause of their overthrow and subjection.</p>
            <p>At last the Cardinall being dismissed, and marching up the Countrey with his Army of fifteene Thousand, Horse and Foote, he fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Fenlo,</hi> neare to <hi>Mastrick,</hi> where being no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner arrived, but as soone one <hi>Brederode,</hi> a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard borne <hi>Hollander,</hi> Governour thereof, sold and gave up the Towne, for the value of twenty

Thousand pounds Starling, being suborned and enticed by the Jesuits remaining there: So was it a well deserved Recompence for the Prince, that should have admitted any Popish Priests to have stayed there, after he was Master of the place.</p>
            <p>This base treacherous Villaine fled away thence to <hi>Culloine,</hi> with foure other inward Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, his Consorts, where hee and they runne their heads, in the midst of a Cloyster to stay, which otherwise should have beene detrenched for unnaturall Treason, being <hi>Flemings.</hi>

            <p>And yet more, on the North side of the Towne, at the house of pleasure, (being a place of Recreation for the House of <hi>Nassow</hi>) by which the Sea flowed up in <hi>Mark,</hi> to <hi>Bredaes</hi> Port, hee caused to damme it up,<note place="margin">The flowing Tide re-enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced backe to the <hi>Sea.</hi>
               </note> and stop the flowing thereof, with huge toyle and charges, and dash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back againe, in despight of the Sea, its owne disgorgements; and secured so the North parts of the Towne, that there was neither issuing from it, nor entering to it.</p>
            <p>Being thus wonderfully fortified, hee sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the fourth part of his Army, Horse and Foot, to strengthen the Garrisons of other fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Townes, because the Enemy was roaving

abroad. And likewise he caused to make Bridges over <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Terheyden,</hi> and <hi>Ginnekin,</hi> with three Bridges over <hi>A,</hi> and its branches, whereby the whole circuite of the Trenches within was made passable. Now betweene every quarter about the Lyne,<note place="margin">The ordinary posts about the Trenches.</note> there were eight posts, or divisions of Companies, set upon guard in Quadrons, and betweene these intermingled spaces, there were Centinells fixed, each one within speech of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; where their continuance of all, was ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily twenty foure houres, before their renewing reliefe came; I meane from their quarters.</p>
            <p>All these things exactly done, and provided, then his Highnesse begun to make his Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; where neare to a Water-mill, erecting a Halfe Moone for preservation of Centinells, and workemen, that were to advance other workes dayly neerer and nearer the Towne; and three Troupes of Horses placed there for a safeguard. There sallyed out of the Enemy, a little after Mid-night,<note place="margin">Divers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts.</note> above twelve hundred men, where making an assault upon the Halfe Moone, being sixe for one, yet by a fresh supply which came forthwith from the quarter, they were couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously repulsed, and chased to the Towne, leaving 28. killed behinde them, and thrice as many wounded they tooke with them.</p>
            <p>But now understand me better; there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other sallies made every day out of Towne, as well in the other quarters as here for 3. weekes space, till their Batteries were erected, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny repulses given them backe againe with some

killed, some wounded, and some taken prisoners on both sides.</p>
            <p>But to shun prolixity, I thinke it best to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime their Diurnall and Noctuall proceedings,<note place="margin">The Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches begun.</note> which as they were but fatall and disastruous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, so shall the relation of such crooked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes be as unsavory, and unpleasant to the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader, whose Curiosity would rather rest on the maine and most selected points, than in perusing the misery of miserable effects. The next strenuous and more forcible advancement, was a Battery reared halfe way to the Towne, and planted with six halfe Cannons; and to the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, divers <hi>Redoubts</hi> shadowed with Pikes and Muskets, then began they to make sport to the Enemy. And shortly thereafter, there were two other Batteries nearer and nearer erected, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled with Cannon and Cannoniers, then play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they thick day and night, bellowing Martiall Musicke, against that great and high earthen Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke at <hi>Ginnekin</hi> Port. Upon which the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> had 9. piece of Ordnance, and a whole Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non enstalled, besides other Pieces planted on neighbouring Bulwarks.</p>
            <p>Grievous and hot was the service on both sides, and sometimes their aymes so just, that they burst one anothers Cannon,<note place="margin">Thundering Cannons and roaring Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</note> for almost they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted; insomuch that the Chrystall Aire, and azure skies were rent asunder, and darkened with the excrementall smoake of their combustible paines; yea, and the people and Country Villages abroad and about, were deafned and over-thundred with

their reverberating Ecchoes; and lastly, their tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menduous noyse, and re-enforced reboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding sounds made the Tents, Howts, and Sutlars shops to quake, and the ground to shake and tremble, that me thought the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Earthquake of <hi>Puteoli</hi> had beene trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported hither to the Princes quarter, and yet it was neare an English mile from the inmost Mont and most dreadfull Battery.</p>
            <p>At last, within 17. dayes, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons were dismounted, and they quite beaten off the Bulwarke, and constrained to settle their Ordnance on the lower Flanks of counterban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Bastions,</hi> and could shoote no more at Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; then every man went safe and freely about the Fields and quarter.</p>
            <p>But now leaving these Batteries, to batter downe the Towne-houses, Ports, and moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Walles,<note place="margin">The <hi>Infantry</hi> begin their workes.</note> I come to the Military procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the <hi>Infantery,</hi> and their Approaches: forthwith and at this instant, began they their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching workes and Trenches, making two Divisions: the <hi>French</hi> on the right hand, and the <hi>English</hi> on the left; and thus in short time they accoasted the Enemies <hi>Countersearfe,</hi> and with much adoe beate them from it, to the <hi>Hornewarke</hi> within: where, and at which time there were cruell Conflicts for certaine dayes and nights, and valour exposed to the uttermost of worth.</p>
            <p>Well, at last the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> breasting the <hi>Hornewarke,</hi> and striving who should first

            <p>Secondly, that Gallant and ever lamented Gentleman Captaine <hi>VVilliamson,</hi> who killed three men with his owne hands, and the fourth killed him: The third was Auncient <hi>Hammil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Perdevans</hi> sonne beside <hi>Lithgow,</hi> who lately eight dayes before in another Conflict, had so couragiously behaved himselfe, that hee slew two <hi>Vallounes,</hi> and tooke captive the <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan Cantelmo,</hi> carrying him away perforce, and with strong hand from amongst the midst

save onely Captaine <hi>Williamson,</hi> whose body one <hi>David Anderson</hi> manfully brought off, to his great credit, and thereupon present preferment, and saved thereby his cloaths, and forty pieces of Gold that were in his pockets.

            <p>The next morning after this, the <hi>Scots</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Sally upon the <hi>Hornwarke,</hi>

               </note> and then the <hi>Burgondions</hi> fled, leaving behinde them some Barrels of Beere, a number of Firelocks, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Bedsteads. Well, this deare bought <hi>Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke</hi> was instantly turned over, and made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fencive for the <hi>Victors</hi> use; and then close by the Moate side there were two new Batteries made up, which forthwith dismounting the Enemies Cannon, constrained the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to sinke them lower in the Walles, and so they taught them (as the Proverb is) to eate their meate in order; for upon these foure Batteries here, there were mounted 14. halfe Cannons, with twenty three Cannoniers. Then that same night they begun
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9043:20"/>
their Gallery, whereof one <hi>Iames Lecky</hi> was chiefe Workmaster, who was to have for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the same, Thirty sixe thousand Gilders.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Scots</hi> Gallery.</note>Now to speake a little of a Gallery, and how it is advanced, is thus: They first begin, and set some eight couple of Posts in the dry land fast founded, and then they goe on, and advance o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the watery Moate, by turnes and times, more and more, every post or couple being set two foote from another: As they are thus fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and under, so also are they flanked with boords, bundels of boughes and branches, and earth on both sides, and above, to save the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from Muskets; for altogether these flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not Cannon proofe: And so as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in the Graffe,<note place="margin">What a Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is.</note> they cast in bundels of branches, and armes of Trees, and bushes, and upon them they heape on sand and earth, to fill their watery and plunging way, and so thereby to make a dry foundation, whereon to fixe their Posts. Within it is the height of a man, and so wide, that foure may march side to side into it. In the further end, next the Towne-wall, as they wrought forward, the adventerous labourers had a blind before them, composed of boughes and earth, and that safeguard is sometimes Cannon proofe.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding there were every other day and night some killed, some wanting leggs and armes, and some wounded; yea, and the Cannon would breake downe at divers times sundry of their posts, which were aye speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9043:20"/>
againe: But what offended the Workemen here most,<note place="margin">Morters or Pot-pieces.</note> as also in the other Galleries, were these Morters, or Pot-pieces, three quarters of a Yard long, but exceeding large and wide; which will shoote Granadaes of a hundred pound weight, and more; for it is empty within, which being filled with cut iron, poulder, Pitch, and Sulphure, and so put in the Morter; the Cannonier taketh his height and ayme, (for it is shot off with the mouth halfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) by Art, Compasse, and Geometry, that hee will lay the Granada farre and neare as hee pleaseth: for where it falls, it breakes in pieces, spoyling hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, men, timber-workes, and whatsover it ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters withall.</p>
            <p>And here by the way, I cannot forget a sorrowfull sport: one Night foure fellows working on the <hi>French</hi> Gallerie,<note place="margin">Damnable Granadaes.</note> and two of them killed with the Musket; there fell a Granada in midst of the Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to the which the other two ran to catch it, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it for a Cannon-bullet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as they begun to gripe it, it burst in pieces, and blew them both in the Ayre, rent and torne asunder to nothing. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are these Pot-pieces frequently shot off, but now and then, and at certaine serious times, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the great expences they make; for every charge of any of them, will cost above fourscore and ten Gilders, so large are their bellies, and divelish wide their mouths.</p>
            <p>And now I remember, when the <hi>Scots</hi> Gallery was halfe over the Moate, and Lievtenant Colonell <hi>Couts</hi> standing there, giving directions to Souldiers, there was a <hi>Burgondion</hi> from a wooden Wind-mill, on the Towne-wall, shot him through the thigh, and burst
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9043:21"/>
the bone in pieces, by the which this aged and brave Commander was left there for death; yet at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture there was great hope of his recovery.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the next day, Colonell <hi>Balfoure</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed foure halfe Cannons to bee stalled against the Winde-mill,<note place="margin">A winde-mill broke in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> where downe it came with a rattle, and bruised the bones of some <hi>Burgondions,</hi> till their guts groaned againe. So likewise about this time one Captaine <hi>Wachub</hi> sickned in the quarter,<note place="margin">Captaine <hi>Wachubs</hi> death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and dyed the third day thereafter, which was thought to have beene the Plague; for the Pestilence was in all the quarters, and almost in every Regiment; yet with no force, nor infectious mortality, by reason of the Souldiers going abroad day and night to the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where lying in their clothes, and on the cold ground, infringed the contagion.</p>
            <p>Now as concerning their profession, being in a Leaguer, every Regiment hath a Preacher, and on the Sabbath day under the Colonells Tent a Sermon,<note place="margin">The professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Religion.</note> where few Auditors frequent, unlesse it bee a poore handfull of some well disposed persons. And every day in the Afternoone, according to their turnes, when these Companies came up under their colours, that were to goe for the Trenches and Galleries, then the Predicators of each Regiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest prayer, exhorting their Souldiers to goe on couragiously, and assuredly confident of the pardon of their sinnes in Christs blood; and that they should carry themselves manfully in fighting Gods Battel, for the <hi>Gospells</hi> liberty; which indeede some of them too insolently and desperately performed: for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion now, in most parts of the whole Universe, is turned to policy, wherewith this <hi>Belgican</hi> State is

onely and absolutely invested. And I had almost forgot a divellish weapon which both parties made use of, at their breasting of Trenches, which Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers cognominate, an iron Flaile, and is composed of two pieces, the shortest whereof, having a round head, (not much unlike to a Turkish <hi>Balucco</hi>) is set full of deepe steeled pikes, and they so sharpe and deadly, that there is no resistance nor fence for their blowes, each Souldier threshing death on others fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies.<note place="margin">Iron Flailes threshing death.</note> Nay, I was astonished to behold such hellish Instruments, and my heart wished that the Inventers of them had the same reward, that <hi>Phalaris</hi> gave to <hi>Perillus,</hi> who tortured him in the brazen Bull, which hee invented for the destruction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>And alas, what a poore thing is it, to see so many Gentlemen, and gallant youths of all kinds, to hazard their lives for so small a recompence, as five pence halfe penny a day, five Stivers, having their foode and apparrell to take out of it, besides their hard lying, and turmoyling services: which common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities and profound extreame miseries, I would to God most of our younglings at home knew, then would they be carefull to prevent these languishing adversities,<note place="margin">The misery of a Souldiers life.</note> before they finde the succourlesse smart thereof: for by your leave, if a Souldiers industry be not quickened and animated with bountifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, hee hath lesse will to performe any part of Martiall service, than a dead coarse hath power to arise out of the grave: for what can be more precious to man than his blood? being the fountaine &amp; Nurse of his vitall spirits, and the ground of his bodily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; which no free nor ingenious nature will loose for nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:9043:22"/>And whosoever shall argument or discourse upon found reason, and infallible experience, may easily prove and perceive, that those Commanders have ever best prospered, which have most liberally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and had in singular regard Military Arts and Souldiers: Otherwise the honourable mind would account it a great deale better, to have Death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Life, than Life without Reward; yea, and the noble Commander desiring rather to want, than to suffer true Worth unrecompensed. I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance here many Examples of Ingratitude in great persons, that by their wretchednesse to Souldiers, have first lost themselves, and then their Kingdoms and Principalities; but I desist, onely lamenting what I saw here, that even the chiefest Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, (Fatality is so ordinary to Military procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings) so they obtaine their ambitious ends, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no more the losing of mens lives, than the death of dogges.</p>
            <p>But now I come to the third Quarter, setled on the Townes North side, the <hi>Freizes,</hi> under command of Counte <hi>Casmir</hi> their Generall: Truely they had the most difficult passage to make their Approaches,<note place="margin">The <hi>Freizes</hi> quarter and their adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> than any of the other two besides; for they had a long and fastidious way of marish water, to march along a Dike blinded with bushes, to their workes before the Castle: Yet they were still advancing their encroachments to affront the Enemies <hi>Hornewarke,</hi> which they thrice invaded, and were still repulsed, with a great losse of many of their best Officers and Souldiers. And howsoever they came short of the policies and expedition of the other two Quarters, yet in the end, being ashamed of their postponed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9043:22"/>
they desperately, on Satturday at mid-day, <hi>September</hi> 29. <hi>Stilo Gregorio</hi> set upon the Enemies <hi>Hornewarke,</hi> and made exceeding good fire for an houres space, and beate their Opposers into the Towne, with great mortality on both sides, and so turned over the worke defencible for themselves: Whereupon they began their Gallery, but to no purpose, the other three being closing with the VVales and theirs in twenty dayes time could not have beene perfected; where now I leave them, (neverthelesse) well worthy of a good remembrance: their Batteries were onely foure, and planted with twelve halfe Cannons.</p>

                  <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done.</note> I found shortly thereafter, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and French galleries fully done, and fastned to the Root of the promontoriat Bastion, where there and then each Nation begun to worke their Mines. In this performance, the French out-stripped the English, and had advanced their insinuating pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects two pikes length in the Wals, besides divers dividuat chambers in the Worke before the other; but yet the English gallerie was thicker of posts, and stronger builded than the French: For indeede the English had bin mightily hindred in advancing their gallery, by the Enemies Cannon, which often ramversed divers of their posts; and as they were as speedily renewed agayne, with the losse of many poore lives; so these work-men adventured to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the gallery here, and in the other two galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries also, for extraordinary wages, some ten, some
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9043:23"/>
twenty dollors in a night: And notwithstanding, most of these desperate labourers, made a dolorous end, and never enjoyed them, for the Muskets without and fire-locks within, day nor night, wer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at rest; besides skirmishes and ambushes still from either party exploited at all advantages. Truely, I speake it credibly, the French nation did never so good service, with such promptitude and dexterity, and so happy a successe, as here before <hi>Breda</hi>; neither did they ever gaine the like commendation since their first comming here, to serue under the States, as the whole Army, not themselves did testifie.</p>
            <p>Well, upon the first of October, the Prince rode downe, with two followers, to the galleries, (as he most adventrously did every day) to pry into the Mines,<note place="margin">The mynes begun in the Towne-walls.</note> for he himselfe is an excellent Engenier: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his abode there, the Cannon and the Musket played most grievously upon the Towne-houses and Wals, in so much that the Enemy could hardly soot himselfe for any shot at all. But when night came, and the Spaniards re-setling their Cannons in the hollow flankes of their Bulwarks, then fell both sides to worke, and all the Quarters about the Towne, with thundring and roaring sounds, as if Heaven and Earth had met together, yea, and with a greater clamour then the <hi>Vlyssen</hi> wooden Horse made to fatall <hi>Troy.</hi> For the Princes Cannon went e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the night till the morning as thicke off, as the nimble fingers of a youngling,<note place="margin">Great thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.</note> play upon the Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; but their Musicall Notes were different, the one delicious, and the other dreadfull. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and because the strength of the Enemy grew defective, their forces impaired by slaughter, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9043:23"/>
their Amunition altogether deficient, (which was well knowne to the Prince, and the whole Army a Fort-night before this their re-enforced submission) then beate they their Drummes about the walles,<note place="margin">The Enemy beates a parly to render the Towne.</note> for a generall parley to all the Quarters, about seven a Clocke on Tuesday morning, <hi>October</hi> 6. <hi>Stilo Italico,</hi> and so the Cannon ceased on both sides, and there was no more shooting, invasion, nor resistance.</p>
            <p>Upon which there sorted an Officer from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour at <hi>Ginnekin</hi> Port, and well mounted on Horsebacke, who rode Post up to his Highnesse, rancountering me as I ran downe to the Trenches. The Commission of the Governour being delivered to the Prince, and his flexibility considered, there were Hostages sent from both sides, for the assurance of fidelity to other; three aged Colonells from the Prince, and sixe Burgers from the Towne.</p>
            <p>Well, in the Afternoone there came from the Towne five sufficient men of quality, and a Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Priest, cloathed in a white Robe, and a white Hat, signifying Peace; (for he was no Monke, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee had beene <hi>Lucifer</hi> in a Monkes habit, nor none of the like order in the Towne) These sixe came (I say) to capitulate with the Prince, and Councell of War, upon pretended Articles. They moved the Prince for the Freedome of a Church to celebrate the Masse into, for the staying of some of their Clergy there, and some other libertinous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; but they were all refused with this solid and generall Answer: To wit, that these Conditions which <hi>Spineola</hi> 13. yeeres before, <hi>Anno</hi> 1625. <hi>Iuly</hi> 5. gave to Colonell <hi>Morgan,</hi> who was constrained by famine, after 11. Moneths siege to surrender it; the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9043:24"/>
selfe same conditions should they receive, and no more, and so it was concluded under the shaddow of Eighteene Articles, the chiefest whereof were these:<note place="margin">The Articles and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </note> First, that they should have three dayes time to stay in the Towne, to prepare and accommodate themselves, and what they had for Transportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, that the Prince should furnish them with foure hundred Waggons, to carry away their loggage, baggage, Women, Children, Priests, and lame men for the Towne of <hi>Machlein.</hi> Thirdly, that they should march out of Towne with flying Colours, kindled Matches, shouldred Muskets, and Bullets in their mouthes. Fourthly, that they should take with them foure halfe Cannons, and two Pot-pieces; but the courteous Prince gave them two more, which made sixe <hi>Cartouses,</hi> and two Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Fiftly, that none should search nor enquire for what they carried, nor no recapitulation to bee made of booties and blood past, and that there should goe a Convoy of Horsemen with them halfe way to <hi>Machlein.</hi> Sixtly, that all the Towne Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which were Papists, should have two yeeres time to reside there, for disposing of their houses, lands, or goods, during the which space, they were to enjoy the profits of whatsoever they had, and then to depart, under the paine of severe punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and confiscation of their estate. Seventhly, that the two Nunneries there, should have liberty to keepe within doores enduring life; but no Priest to be allowed them for Masses, nor to stay within the Towne, under the paine of Death. Eightly, that those Souldiers which were fallen sicke, lame, or wounded, lying in the Hospitall for health, should
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9043:24"/>
remaine there in safety till their convalescment, and then to have a safe convoy,<note place="margin">The Waggons sent to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> sent with them halfe way to <hi>Machlein.</hi> Ninthly, that there should two suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Pledges stay in <hi>Breda,</hi> untill such time, that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> sent backe the aforesaid Waggons and Bowres without any dammage or offence.</p>
            <p>Leaving as unnecessary the lesser Articles to bee rehearsed: Vpon Saturday, <hi>October</hi> 10. the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons being all in readinesse, and sent in unto them, and well provided with good Horses, they begun to take their journey, about 11. a clocke in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, but very slowly, which wearied our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: First then, there marched forth 3. severall and distant divisions of Muskets, Firelocks, and Pikes, and the fourth division came last of all with the Governour, and hee also in a Coach, carrying with them fifty one Colours, the halfe of which wanted Companies, being cut off at the siege, so that one Auncient sometimes carried three Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,</p>
            <p>Betweene the first three, and last division, came all the Waggons along, one drayning after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with their Household stuffe, (ô miserable furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) Women, Children, and wounded people, with sixe halfe Cannon, and two pot peices.</p>
            <p>Next unto the Bussport, at their forth comming, and without two draw Bridges and an empty Court du guard, stood the Prince his owne Guard, 300. Foot, and a troupe of Horses, all armed, with Cors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and head-peices as cleare as silver,<note place="margin">The Enemies marching out of <hi>Breda.</hi>
               </note> or shining like to <hi>Eurileus Murreon</hi> in the Cinthian night; by &amp; along whose faces they marched through Count <hi>Casmirs</hi> Brigade, for they were in armes, because they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9043:25"/>
passed through their quarter, and in one part their Trenches were cast downe for their departure.</p>
            <p>But what shall I say of the great concurrence, and innumerable numbers of people which flocked hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of all sorts under the States, Merchants, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Bowres, maides, and wives. that came, to see this <hi>Hispanicall</hi> farewell; nay, certainely there were above three hundred thousands, yong and old: for such a sight at once, and on the faire Fields, was never seene assembled together, (as I may say) since <hi>Tamberlanes</hi> dayes; that in my conceite it was a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer thing to behold the infinite multitude heere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated, than either to stand gazing upon the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished Viadants, or to admire the alacrious faces of the triumphing Victors.</p>
            <p>Then before the last division of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and behind the Waggons,<note place="margin">

Dominican Friars, and eight <hi>Augustines,</hi> all in blacke and white ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. Next to them came some stragling <hi>Cordeleirs,</hi> amounting to ten, whom the <hi>Italians</hi> denominate <hi>Chiogolanti,</hi> because they weare wooden shooes: Then after them issued out five or sixe staggering Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Priests,<note place="margin">Some drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priests.</note> who partly for sorrow to leave the Towne and friends, and partly to expell their visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble causes of griefe, and invisible melancholy, they were so overwhelmed in the plunging profundity of <hi>Bachaniall</hi> streames, that one tumbled downe here, and another fell there, whereby they became a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to all the Army, and a miserable mockery to scornefull Spectators: Now amongst the VVag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons there were heere and there certaine stragling Firelocks marching along, and behind their heeles,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9043:25"/>
that predominant and imperious sect of the <hi>Tiatine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Jesuits, being fourteene in number, and as well mounted on Carroshes of foure wheeles, as if they had beene <hi>African</hi> Apes, riding on Elephants of foure leggs.</p>
            <p>The last division of the foure was the strongest of all,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Capushin</hi> Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars marching forth before the Governor.</note> and best accommaded; where behind them and before the Governour, marched seven couple of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pushin</hi> Friars, the first of which paires carryed a high wooden Crosse, with a Ladder, a Reed, a hanging Spunge, and a Launce fastened to it, with other dependancies. The aged Governour being postre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest, was mounted in a Coach, and overloaden with all the signes of a dejected countenance, marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after the rest, (and I after him) to the utmost Trench or Line. Where the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his comming, accompanied with these three Princely brothers, his grand Nephews, Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> with all the other Dukes, Counts there present, and Generalls of the Army.</p>
            <p>The Governour approaching his Highnesse, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed the Coach, and mounting on Horsebacke, saluted his Conquerour, with an exceeding low cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, and wringing complements:<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres with the Governour in his journey.</note> The benigne Prince did fully the like to him; where after halfe an houres conference, and blandements blowne on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mouthes, the weeping Governour tooke a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall farewell of his victorious Adversary.</p>
            <p>The number of these foure Divisions, which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched away in Armes, were thought to be (besides foure hundred stragling Firelocks<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) about fifteene hundred Souldiers, all lusty men, and in good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9043:26"/>
whose Martiall countenances seemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have overcome these who overcame them, than to have beene vanquished by their valour, and inexpugnable fortunes; whose brave service and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate defence, for approved worth and deserved fame, may justly claime the <hi>Constantinopolitan Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drome,</hi> to engrave thereon their couragious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievments, which in ten weekes and five dayes time they worthily performed. And truely I may say, although I have small reason for it, (when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member these miseries I sustayned in <hi>Malaga</hi>) that never Souldiers did more, nor could doe better. Well, and thrice well, and howsoever they fought well, they are now well gone; and straight at the last of their backes, when they left the Towne, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the Princes Guard, and twelve other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, to keepe the Burgers unwronged from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidiary Souldiers, till a constant Garrison was set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>At their entering the Gate, and I with them, his Highnesse Trumpetters, from above in a Bulwarke, founded three times, the most joyfull <hi>Victoria,</hi> and the sweetest melodious Tryumph, that ever I heard in all my life, wheresoever I have beene. Now for contentment I stayed five nights in <hi>Breda,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Authors abode in <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi>
               </note> as glad to have obtained the freedome, which I had so deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought before, in lying seven weekes and foure nights in wet straw Howtes, on cold straw-beds, and continually in my cloaths, which was a Noctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Limbus</hi> to try my patience, as the Leaguer was a diurnall Purgatory for the purging of money out of my purse.</p>
            <p>But now, not to bee oblivious, I recall, that at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9043:26"/>
the beginning and about the middle time of the siege, there remained heere in the Princes quarter for certaine dayes, these two noble Lords, the Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Northampton</hi>; and with him was the Queenes Majesties Dwarfe, strenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Ieffrey,</hi> that <hi>Cyclopian</hi> creature, whose Gygan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme body made the Bulwarkes of <hi>Breda</hi> to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: But rather I would say, this Sonne of <hi>Cono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas</hi> made the whole Army to admire his monstrous smalnesse; who for this <hi>Bellonean</hi> practice our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion saw, hee may justly, as Generall, lead an Army of Pigmaes to the <hi>Catopian</hi> Fields; where <hi>Molon,</hi> Commander of the contrary Campe, will runne at tilt against him, with the Launce of a Rush, as long as a straw: and so leaving this memorable Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a living Statue, I returne to my purpose. Truely it was a pleasant thing to behold the cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance of common Souldiers, when they marched to the <hi>Court du Guard</hi> in the Market place, and to other remoter staunces about the walles; for they looked all as Lords of this vanquished Lady.</p>
            <p>And now the next morning after my first entery in the Towne, being Sunday, there were two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons made in the great Church by <hi>Dutch</hi> Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants to Gods glory, where the day preceding, there had beene fifteene Masses, celebrate to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of imaginary Saints. For Wine and victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als we found plenty in the Towne, and no scarcity of any thing save of favourable faces; and for excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good Beere of all <hi>Belgia, Breda</hi> is the Daughter of <hi>Bacchus.</hi>

invenomed with the perturbulent Iesuits before their departure.</p>
            <p>The Towne it selfe I found mightely deformed, and the houses beaten downe most lamentably with the Cannon; in all these three corned streets, that were opposite, to the three quarters without, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Ginnekin</hi> streete, from the Princes batteries was worst defaced; that it grieved me to heare of the great fatality, these downe-falling houses brought to the inhabitants, as also the sorrow to behold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two extreames, the miserable effects of warre; which I leave my mourning Muse to deplore.</p>

            <p>Now the next morning after the Towne was surrendred, there came forty eight Trumpeters before the Princes lodging, and sounded the victory over <hi>Breda,</hi> and after them came foure hundred three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and twelve drummes, doing the like, to whom and every one of them, there was rewards given as a thing due to their Calling after any victory.</p>
            <p>The third day of this vicissitude, being munday morning, then the whole quarters began to slight and cast downe their workes, equalizing them with the ground; but understand me better, no man wrought but for extraordinary pay, for they can not compell a Souldier, by the law of Armes, to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more than march, watch, and fight, without a secondary acknowledgement: but the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult toile of all, was to empty the moate, of infinite bundles of Boughes and armes of Trees, and to pull downe the Galleries, whose erections had been so fatall to many misfortunate lives.</p>
            <p>Then, and at that time, all the Country Bowres

            <p>And from the Easterne <hi>Germany,</hi> the like good newes came by one Mr. <hi>Grahame,</hi> sonne to the Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of <hi>Killearne,</hi> that the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Austrian</hi> forces, a ponderous overthrow: And with these <hi>Buonos Novellos,</hi> came the Victory of <hi>Bernard Saxe Wymer,</hi> fought beside <hi>Strausberg,</hi> against the Imperiall Army, where with many thousands the Emperors Generall was killed. Neither may I thrust in Oblivion the auspicuous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and approved valour of mine ever renowned Countrey-man, Generall <hi>Lesslie,</hi> who in a most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular manner, <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. <hi>August</hi> 9. at the battell of <hi>Whitesock,</hi> (besides other famous and fortunate Conflicts) had both the <hi>Vanguard</hi> and the Victory. O memorable Victory! and put to flight the Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> and the Imperialists with great slaughter; seazing on foure thousand Waggons, five whereof were loaden with Ricks Dollours, and with them twenty eight pieces of Ordnance.</p>
            <p>Where, and at which Rancounter, that hardy and redoubted Gentleman Colonell <hi>Robert Cunyngham</hi> was slaine,<note place="margin">Certaine va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Scots</hi> Worthies.</note> a sonne of the house of <hi>Boniton</hi> upon the River of <hi>Clyde,</hi> and once my Condisciple in <hi>Lanerk.</hi> Nor dare I seclude from this commemoration, that ever honoured Commander, Generall <hi>Ruthwen,</hi> whose fidele service and manly prowesses are Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9043:29"/>
knowne, as well to the foes, as to the friends of <hi>Swethlands</hi> Crowne. And what shall I speake of late Colonell <hi>Hepburne</hi>? but let <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and fatall <hi>Loraine,</hi> where hee was killed, affirme and approve of him, that hee was absolutely one of the best Souldiers in Christendome, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the World. After whose death, succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his place the younger Colonell <hi>Hepburne,</hi> his Cousin, sonne and apparent Heire of that ancient House of <hi>Wachton,</hi> who now lately, on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>France,</hi> and about the former disastruous place, hath suffered the like fatall blow of preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous death.</p>
            <p>But now to returne to the <hi>Lesslies,</hi> of whom there are so many valorous Colonells and Captaines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the aforesaid Generall, that I may justly averre it, that there are not so many of one Surname with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Europe,</hi> and in this Age, have acquisted more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, honour, and indubitable reputation, than that Heroick and <hi>Bellonean</hi> Name hath done.<note place="margin">Twenty eight <hi>Scots</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells at one time under the King of <hi>Swethland.</hi>
               </note> Whereof <hi>Gustavus</hi> ghost may testifie not onely of them, but also of divers other worthy and noble Commanders, as these honourable Colonells, <hi>Mackay,</hi> now Lord of <hi>Raye</hi>; two of the Surnames of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> Earles of <hi>Crawfurd,</hi> the noble <hi>Forbes,</hi> two of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> three of <hi>Cuningham</hi>; the rest of the Colonels were <hi>Minroe, Lumsdale, Stewart, Keith, Baillie, Gunne,</hi> and that once highly respected Commander under the Marquesse of <hi>Hannay,</hi> Sir <hi>Iames Ramsey</hi> lately decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: with sundry like Colonells, and many Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of notable memory; and so from them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of the whole <hi>Scots,</hi> their followers, that they have beene the nerves and sinews of his Army, yea,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9043:29"/>
and the Sword of his right hand: for as the <hi>Myrme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> were the Bulwarkes of <hi>Alexanders</hi> fortunes, so were they the Pike and Buckler of all <hi>Adolphus</hi> most glorious Atchievments, as well in <hi>Prucia, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> as on the borders of <hi>Russia,</hi> or else where; whose proper and peculiar Acts of most of them I could seriously divulge, but time, it traitours me: neither may this present Volumne permit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse any prolixious subject, (howsoever necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) unlesse I had a proposed drift to perfect punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a larger Relation than this, their generous and generall proceedings, their Heroick Exploits, and fastidious following of their adventurous labours in Martiall Discipline; and so I hasten to <hi>Finis.</hi>

            <p>But what shall I say? <hi>Scotland</hi> now a dayes hath no Historian, bravest Wits turne dull, Poëts sing dumbe, Pen-men grow deafe, and best spirits slumber. And why? because there is no <hi>Mecenas,</hi> as little regard,<note place="margin">Ingratefull Times.</note> farre lesse reward to laborious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corders. So that now by numbers of ingratefull Patrones, the praises of past Worthies lie interred in the dust, and future times robbed of the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knowledge of things past and present; and thus in the darknesse of Ingratitude, the living men mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the memory of the dead. Nay, and worse, Pen-men now may not labour in their paines, because of clownish Carpers, Critticks, Calumniators, and distracted Censurers, that tare the life of Vertue in pieces with their spightfull tongues; for it is a more facile thing for a Miscreant to judge, than to suffer judgement himselfe: And especially some raw-mouthd younglings, (nay, rather fondlings) who being newly Laureate, after short foure
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9043:30"/>
halfe yeares time spent in the Colledge, they come forth from this small Commencement, (wanting wit, judgement, and understanding) like to Bulls broken out from Dungeons, to beare the faces of the world: Wise men are ignorant to them, the Laiety but Lubbards; old men but fooles, and they will have men of honour, to honour them with the first good morrow, the top of the Table, the Right hand,<note place="margin">The arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of young beardlesse Schollers.</note> and the entery of the Doore. And why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are over-master'd with Art, not Masters of it; having their shallow braines loaden with the empty apprehension of bottomlesse Syllogismes, rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ragges of Heathnish Philosophy, and clouted phrases of Paganisme Authors, who but they? and if they rayle upon Divine Authority, Vulgars say, they are brave Schollers, hopefull youths, and well set; away, runne here and there, goe beyond Sea, to teach and concionate. Some of which presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous crew I found here in the Leaguer before <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> (I meane of mine owne Countrey-men, and none other) whose beardlesse mouths have greater neede of more Learning, Knowledge, and Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than to dare to doe the thing they cannot doe; whose Names I reserve to discover in my verball and ordinary discourses.</p>
            <p>And now to close up all, the two aforesaid Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of <hi>Marck</hi> and <hi>A,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marck</hi> and <hi>A,</hi> returned to their owne courses.</note> were returned againe to their owne Channells, yet not without great dammage, and impetuous violence done to their next borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring bounds. After this the Army dissolved, and every Company sent to their owne Garrison: where from thence also, the Prince with his ordinary Guard went up the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to surveigh and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9043:30"/>
the Townes and places there of greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with all necessary provision.</p>
            <p>Whence I falling downe from <hi>Breda</hi> to <hi>Dunhag,</hi> presented the Majesty of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> with some of my former workes: And having viewed and reviewed her princely Children here, and at <hi>Leyden,</hi> six sonnes and foure Daughters, whom God may long blesse, prosper, and preserve; I returned to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and thence I imbarked for <hi>Camphiere</hi> in <hi>Zeland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I thinke it not amisse, to lay open briefly some generall Observations that I gathered of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> their condition of living, their politick go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and of their forces by Sea and Land. First then,<note place="margin">The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the <hi>Dutcher.</hi>
               </note> as for their carriage and manner of conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are a selfe-loving people, just and strict in their bargaines, nothing to spare, nothing to lend; cheape buyers, and deare sellers; civill in shew, and churlish of nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Birth and breeding sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable to the Mechanick vulgarity of their actions; painefull and industrious for profit, but nowayes courteous, nor charitable: Their Gentry is mesculat, and the true Quintessence thereof remaining onely in the house of <hi>Bredrod</hi>; they keepe their houses clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and goe honestly apparrelled; they will doe any thing for advantage, and nothing without gaine: They are great misregarders of Strangers, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they live safely under the shelter of their bloody Swords; and in a word, they are <hi>Pharises</hi> without, and hollow <hi>Hebrewes</hi> within.</p>
            <p>For government,<note place="margin">The provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent States.</note> the States, they are sublimely politick, wonderfull provident, and great Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencers abroad; and for preventing inconveniences and foreseeing of safety, their Republick excelleth

               <hi>Venice,</hi> and all the Common-wealths of the world; they are mighty in meanes, laying grievous Taxes and Assizes upon the people, which still double the value of any thing the Commonalty buy or sell.</p>

            <p>And now to observe my methodicall order, I found in the aforesaid <hi>Camphiere</hi> a <hi>Scots Staple,</hi> and over it a venerable Gentleman, Master <hi>Patrick Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> Lord <hi>Conservator</hi> there for the Burroughs, (Merchants, and Traffickers here) of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to whose love I celebrate this gratefull memory.</p>
            <p>This Isle of <hi>VVaker,</hi> a part of <hi>Zeland,</hi> is eight English miles in length, and thrice as much in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite, contayning these three Townes, <hi>Camphiere</hi> to the East, <hi>Middlebrough</hi> in the midst, and <hi>Flushen</hi> to the South-west: betweene which Townes there is a delicate smooth Calsey of thin Bricke, hedged and ditched on both hands; that in walking of it, me thought I had beene in the Valley of <hi>Suda,</hi> else in the <hi>Tempian</hi> Plaines, watered with pleasant <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>messis.</hi> Arrived at <hi>Flushen,</hi> and attending for Transportation to <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Five <hi>Flusherer</hi> Ships seaz'd on three <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirkers.</hi>
               </note> there came in one morning five <hi>Zelander</hi> ships, men of Warre, who brought in three prizes, <hi>Dunkirker</hi> ships, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with threescore and twelve pieces of Ordnance, some whereof were Brazen halfe Cannon and Culve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9043:31"/>
and on these ships three hundred and sixteene Captives, who now lye there incarcerate till their Redemption.</p>
            <p>Indeede these <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> brought with them a great deale of joy to the Inhabitants: but what shall I say? the second night following, a drunken Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot cast away one of these great ships (brought in these prizes) upon the Isle of <hi>Cassand,</hi> just before the Towne; of whom, and of them, I may say as <hi>Maharrabell</hi> said to his Master, <hi>Vincere scis</hi> Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, <hi>victoria uti nescis.</hi> But now to conclude, if there be any Britannian or Hybernian desirous to see and try the effects of Purgatory, let him go over to <hi>Flushen,</hi> where it will soone purge his purse of Money, and his Heart of patience; and so farewell, for I am landed at <hi>Gravesend.</hi>
