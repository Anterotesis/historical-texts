         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

uncharitable in your cenſures for my converſation:
Pray pardon me that I am by miſchance ruſht into

ſwords are drawne, and the thread of mans life,
as twas ever ſoone cut or knapt aſunder, ſo it ſeems

               </gap>s of His Armies and abuſes of His Commiſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Governours, the former His gracious
Meditations let you and all the world know. As
to the latter, I am ſatisfied from His owne ſacred
lips, when upon occaſion of my giving His Majeſty
(according to the duty of my command) an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of affaires and perſons in the Weſt of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
His Majeſty (deare King) was pleaſed paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
to tell me, that he was confident the relation
I gave was juſt, and patiently he added (Oh the
mirrour!) that he was reduced to that unhappy
condition, as to be forced to truſt Knaves and knew
not how to help it. Our preſent King, CHARLS
the ſecond (ſuch a Son to ſuch a Father, as I believe
the world never paraleld) though reduced certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to as much neceſſity, as ever ſo great a Prince
was, what time as he went from one Nation to
another, from one Kingdome to another people,
(God ſuffering no man though to do him wrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad)
he became an object of pitty (mixt with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)
from all the nobly diſpoſed perſons in the
world, and an object of ſcornings &amp; laſhings of the
Independent Engliſh tongues, eſpecially in Holland,
that had never ſeen him, but ſuch as with the Queen
of Sheba (hearing of his fame) came to behold the
magnanimity of his courage, and the conſtancy of
<pb facs="tcp:35659:5"/>
his vertues in the baniſhment from His other Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
poſſeſſions, became aſtoniſhed, and either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
convinced, penitent and Loyall, or elſe
ſeized with horrour, went home trembling
in their ſoules, at the ſight of His ſacred Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
that I have charity to hope, an holy ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from His Majeſties divine influence, will
ſteale them alſo by degrees to their own ſalvation;
yet this King (ſtrangely happy, and I know not
how it comes to paſſe) in this low condition, (as it
ſeemed to the world) was then (now His Majeſty
is in power is more) a ſtrict reprehender of vice,
and a vigilant obſerver of thoſe who became too
ſawcy with Majeſty (clouded in fortune onely, not
in face) and kept up by his owne grace and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
a Kingſhip perfectly in himſelfe, not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the leaſt paſſion for the abſence from His
Crownes, which was the greater conqueſt then of
the world, and that deſire of His Martyr'd Father
hath therein taken effect, when he wiſhed, rather
that he might prove CHARLES <hi>le bon,</hi> then
CHARLES <hi>le grand;</hi> indeed as the world alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

that goodneſſe is now leading His Majeſty by
the hand to greatneſſe (having ſought the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

according to the old Propheſie, as he is <hi>e Carolo
Carolus,</hi> ſo he wilbe ſhortly <hi>Deo annuente Carolo

<pb facs="tcp:35659:6"/>
of faith; but ſince the beginning <hi>(ſtilo novo)</hi> of
June 1650. Gods immediate hand hath guided the
King viſibly to the eye of ſenſe and reaſon (yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
comprehenſion too:) And at this day His
Majeſty, by the conduct of Heaven, is arrived,
from the moſt uncertaine (I may ſay deſperate)
condition, wherein His Majeſty then was, to ſo
great a degree of glory, as was then wholely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired
of by moſt, that ever he would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
in this world; for, what clouds were over
His Majeſties affaires at Breda! after a treaty there
began with the Scots Commiſſioners? to effect
which treaty, there was no ſmall difficulty atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
His Majeſty at Jerſey, where His Majeſtyes
Privy Counſell, Lords, and Counſell at Law were
divided in opinion; nay, the Duke of York, that moſt
hopefull and illuſtrious Prince was perſwaded in
judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for the King to declare againſt all treaties
with that party of Rebell Scots, His Highneſſe and
the diſcenting Lords, relying wholely with Gods
bleſſing, on the formerly almoſt miraculous Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe
of Montroſſe, who was then gone to kindle
a loyall fire by His Majeſties Commiſſion, in the
Highlands of the Scottiſh Nation, but Gods wayes
are unſearchable, and his works paſt finding out;
the Kings heart is in Heavens hand, and he diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it as Rivers of waters, which way ſoever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
him; and though moſt think it tedious to
wait on Gods providence in the weary ſteps which
<pb facs="tcp:35659:6"/>
muſt be taken, about the meanders, dividings, and
unitings, turnings and returnings of the ſtreames
(after many miles ſtraggling, paſſing againe neare
the ſame place) and though almoſt all that look not
with the eye of faith more ſteddily than the eye of
reaſon, not only loſe the current when it entereth
the concaves and hollowes of the earth, but their
hopes too, and are poſſeſſed with deſpayre of ever
ſeeing thoſe refreſhing waters breake out any

though they channelled under many an hill
and rocky cragge, hee cuts a way to their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and ſatisfieth the world by experience, That

they bee ſefely brought to the Sea, their Centre,
where they emboſome in the greatneſſe and glory

trembling, for our deare Kings ſake) might viſibly
read treachery and moſt abominable falſhood; their
Prieſts Prayers and Preachings, premiſing nothing
but ſlavery to the King, and their groanings and
whinings, only to gull the ſilly flocke that could
have ſo much unchriſtian patience as to hear them.
His Majeſty by this Treaty, if hee could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them into an agreement, (which if any thing,
unleſſe a contract to lay down his life, and (which
was infinitely dearer) his Honour, he was reſolved
to bring them to, if not,) yet his Majeſty would
leave them excuſeleſſe in whatſoever might be the
conſequence, that ſo they ſhould by their owne ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious,
and avaritious capitulations, and ſawcy
rejections, affronting their Maker in the perſon of
his Anoynted, draw their owne guilt, and their
owne bloud, upon the pates of them and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities.
The King during this Treaty, had a hard
taske, to comport with variety of tempers and
conſtitutions, ſo, as to keepe them, though enemies
one to another, friends to himſelfe. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
often grew peremptory; but at ſuch
time, his Majeſty would quickly awe them into
ſome reverence, by letting them know hee was
their King. His Majeſties old friends, that all wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
one end, yet unhappily divided in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb facs="tcp:35659:7"/>
of the meanes thereunto conducing, grew to
aſmuch jealouſie and enmity one with another, as
ever the Presbyterians and Independents were at:
So, that the friends to the Treaty, looke on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers,
as enemies to the King, and the other party
reciprocally on them, that not onely the declarers,
became averſe one to another, but the moderate or
neuters, (who waited for the Kings Highway) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their ſoules bound up in Buffe of obedience to
Him in eyther, became neglected or miſtruſted of
both; yet the Treaty goes on, the antipathy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
the whileſt, and it is beleeved Marqueſſe
MONTROSSE was perſwaded from thence, by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
inſtructions from eminent perſons, to make a
bolt or a ſhaft of his buſineſſe, to winne the horſe,
or loſe the ſaddle; breake the Treaty by Conqueſt,
or at leaſt attempt ſomething to make the Treaters
more modeſt, which his Excellency putting in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
during the Treaty, fayled of thoſe friends
in Scotland, and of thoſe ſupplies of horſe, armes,
men, and (as the ſinew of all warre) money, from
Forreigne Kings and Princes, which probably had
the Treaty never began, or had beene then ended,
he would have found, and have beene accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with wonted ſucceſſe. But his Excellency (all
theſe things falling under a ſtrong fate) became
moſt unfortunately taken in his firſt deſigne, was
carried Priſoner to Edenborough, where hee was
met with the Sentence of Condemnation, to bee
<pb facs="tcp:35659:8"/>
hanged by the common Hangman, (O unworthy
bloudy Judges!) which he cheerefully embraced,
and they moſt barbarouſly put in Execution with
all ſpeed, to haſten his death and glory and their
owne ſinne and ſhame together, and that power
which the Kirke onely feared in the perſon of
that gallant MONTROSSE, being now layd
low, they reſolve to break all treaties with the
King, but in the nick the Commiſſioners had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with His Majeſty, and His Majeſty was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
with them from Breda towards Scotland;
His Majeſty no ſooner came to Hounſlowdike (an
houſe of the Prince of Oranges neare the ſea ſide)
in order to his voyage, but His Majeſties cares
were there ſaluted with the unwelcome newes of
the death of that incomparable MONTROSSE,
the deep ſenſe whereof ſo pierced His Majeſties
Royall heart, that there could not but ariſe new
conflicts within His Princely ſoule: The oppoſite
Lords 'tis probable take this advantage to renew
their arguments of diſſwaſion: And His Majeſty
was no doubt at a great ſtraite what to reſolve;
to take notice of pittyed MONTROSSE either by
word or looke, (I may ſay) His Majeſty durſt not,
(though he dared do any thing heaven ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand)
leſt then the ſquinting Commiſſioners
ſhould grow jealous of his love to them, by any
kindneſſe His Majeſty might ſhew to his deare
MONTROSSE'S memory; if His Majeſty ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:35659:8"/>
goe with them now, He ſaw well, that that party
that had contributed to the Execution of his Royall
Fathers Perſon, had already executed his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
power in His Commiſſion to brave MON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TROSSE;
and therefore if His Majeſty went,
'twas with apparant danger to His owne life: If
he ſtayd he knew not which way to turne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
that yeare muſt needs be quite loſt, for all
the Offers and Officers from Denmark and Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and all other aſiſtance, the Scots had rejected,
as able to do the buſineſſe (they intended) alone;
beſides, His Majeſty ſhould be ſtrangely look'd on
the world over: And more then this, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
word was paſſed, and no other viſible means
left for His Majeſty to bee active towards His
Crownes at preſent; after all which conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Heaven inclines the Kings heart, and His
Majeſty moſt cheerfully approves, and on Sunday
morning 9. of June <hi>(ſtilo novo)</hi> 1650. before the
Sun appeared, was His Majeſty taking Coach for
Trehagh, and ſo to take ſhipping, divers of His
Majeſties Lords and Servants having beene aboard
three or foure daies before in His Majeſties ſhip,
and divers of the Scots Commiſſioners and Prieſts
had beene as long in their ſhip; a noble young
Lord and my ſelfe having on the Saturday evening
come off from His Majeſties Ship, were onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
His Majeſties departure from Hounſlowdike
left there behinde, condoling His Majeſties condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:35659:9"/>
and following him with our prayers for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
protection: His Majeſty had not been gone
two houres, (my Lord and my ſelfe retiring to the
next harbour to refreſh before we tooke Boat for
the Hague) but in comes a waggon full of thoſe
Prieſt-ridden Commiſſioners, and thoſe Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner-ridden
Prieſts) ſuch a Gallimofery of ill looks
I know not how to expreſſe them) enquiring ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for His Majeſty, whom we ſoon let know, that
His Majeſty was newly gone, at which they ſeemed
much troubled, and going into the next roome to
us, they drew out their papers and peruſed them,
in conſultation what next to do, by which and
their ill-boding countenances, we eaſily gueſſed
that they had brought ſome new tormenting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
and ſo, ſoone after we heard, they had
received, ſent to them from the power in Scotland,
after Marqueſſe MONTROSSE was ſhamefully
butchered, which 'tis believed were ſo much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then formerly, that His Majeſty could not with
honour have granted, but would rather in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
have diſſolved the Treaty, which was their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
intending (as tis thought, having now freed
themſelves of their feares of MONTROSSE) no
more complyance with His Majeſty, rather choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to adhere to the fortune of their ſwords: But
a good providence had (before theſe tormentors
could recover the Sea ſhore again) ſafely conveyed
His Majeſty on Shipboard; ſo the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb facs="tcp:35659:9"/>
they take Shipping too, and His Majeſty
(with three ſhips only of Hollands men of Warre)
ſets ſayle for Scotland, relying on heaven as His
beſt Convoy, under the ſhaddow of whoſe wings
he ſhall not miſcarry, which brought him, in his
time to a deſired Port: His Majeſty had no ſooner
quitted the Holland ſhore, but the three new-built
Engliſh rebell Friggots (the beſt that ever were)
called the faithfull Speaker, the Preſident, and the
FAIRFAX, came upon the Holland Coaſt in queſt
of the King, ſending to the Hague, they found the
King was newly gone, thereupon ſet ſayle North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in purſuance of His Majeſty, whom after
they had ſought two dayes, with a brave gale of
winde they came upon the North Coaſt of England
neare Scotland, where miſſing the Kings Fleet,
they called a Counſell, at which 'twas concluded,
that if the King had the ſame winde with them,
(whereof there was no doubt) then His Majeſty
by that time muſt needs be in Scotland, ſetting ſayl
a day (at leaſt) before them, ſo the Counſell reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to ſayle according to their former orders to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Weſt of England, quitting all hopes of
their old trade of King-catching for that bout.
This Relation ANTH. YOUNG Captaine of the
Preſident made to me. Whereas His Majeſty was
three and twenty dayes at Sea, bleſſed (as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
with contrary windes, and croſſed (as they
thought then) with calmes; ſo that His Majeſty
<pb facs="tcp:35659:10"/>
was forced to put into an Iſland, in the King of
Denmarks dominions, for freſh proviſions, where
His Majeſty himſelfe in a diſguiſe went on ſhore,
and ſoone returned, and at length they came neare
the Scottiſh ground, very far Northwards (ſo far
that they out went night, being able to read under
decks the ſmalleſt print, when 'twas leaſt light) and
when the King with his Fleet came to the mouth
of Straboggy on one ſide of the harbour, a ſquadron
of the Engliſh Rebell Ships, which had layen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
as an ambuſhment for his Majeſty (have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their expectation of him wearied) then ſayled
outwards on the otherſide, ſo neare were they
meeting each other, that they on the ſhore looked
with no ſmall admiration, whilſt one party was
ſayling in, and the other out; But by reaſon of a
thick Scottiſh miſt that then fell, they were indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
each to other, at leaſt the Rebell Engliſh
did not eſpy the Royall Fleet, God being to them
as to the Iſraelites of old, a cloud to conceale them
from their Engliſh Enemies; indeed Scotch ones
had then poſſeſſion of his Majeſties Perſon, as more
clearely every day appeared; for before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was permitted to land, they offered a diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
violence to his Majeſties righteous Soule, and
'tis admirable to obſerve, the wonders that God
wrought in the deepe for His Majeſties Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo far, for in all probability, had His Majeſty
not ſet ſaile when he did, (neither ſooner nor later)
<pb facs="tcp:35659:10"/>
had He had one gale of winde more, or one calme
leſſe, or any thing but what God did (now appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently)
then allot for Him, His Majeſty had beene
made a prey to His devouring Enemies, or entom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in the monumentall Ocean: But his Majeſty
(thankes be to God) ſafely lands at Straboggy in
the Highlands, being entertained the firſt night by
the Loyal Marquis HUNTLEY, at his houſe, and
that being ſo far Northwards, proves no ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to His Affaires; for the people all the way
came in to ſee, ſeeing admire, and admiring love
with honour their diſtreſſed (but made by Gods
bleſſing on their affection a moſt hopefull) Prince:
Whereas had His Majeſty landed nearer St. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones
(if poſſibly he could) yet in all probability
it had been very unhappy; for when His Majeſty
comes thither, though they ſalute him with haile
Maſter (King of Jewes indeed) yet they cut Him
ſhort in reallity, not admitting His Majeſty to ſit
in their Councels, either of State or War, nor to be
in the Army, becauſe the Souldiers were ſo taken
with (and fond of) Him, which the Kirke were
jealous of, leſt in time He ſhould get their Crowne
from them, for they reſolve, that at beſt He ſhall
have onely the name of King, the Soveraigne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is fit to recide in the Kirke alone, thoſe inſpired
ſonnes of Government; and if His Majeſty can but
once bring His faith to that ſpirituall pitch, as to
believe as the Kirke believes, He ſhall not need
<pb facs="tcp:35659:11"/>
trouble Himſelfe with any thing elſe. They'l eaſe
His head of cares, and His ſhoulders of all Kingly
burthens; His Majeſty ſhall need onely Signe and
Seale what they pleaſe, and Himſelfe may hawke,
hunt, and enjoy thoſe Noble Recreations ſuitable
to His Youth the while, and if this will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Him, He ſhall be brought to the Stoole of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
heare God and Himſelfe (his Annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
blaſphemed in their next belching prayers,
and afrighting preachments (as an Antidote againſt
which His Majeſty might not be permitted to take
any of His Orthodox Divines, either Engliſh or
Scottiſh Chaplaines over with Him) and His En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,
and many Scotch Lords, Officers, and houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
ſervants are baniſhed the Court. His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
muſt further then, be humbled under the pride
of theſe ſpirituall Trumpeters, but it ſhall be ſayd
to be for the ſinnes of His Fathers houſe, and the
Idolatry of the Queen his Mother: Indeed His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
muſt (muſt was never uſed for a King in this
ſence before) doe whatſoever they'l have Him doe,
if He intend to have any reſt in life, or reſpite from
death. Well, His Majeſty (wiſe as an Angell)
acts now the part of a Subject, heares, ſees, and
ſayes nothing, Bleſſed be God, that hath endued ſo
yong a body with ſo prudent a minde, with ſo
meeke a ſoule, a ſoule ſo humble, that I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
God reveales his ſecrets to Him, as he hath
promiſed to doe to thoſe that are ſo qualified to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb facs="tcp:35659:12"/>
them, but he reſiſteth the proud, and the lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe
of the Kirkemen foreruns their deſtruction;
God ſo infatuates their Counſels, as that in the
great pride of their hearts, notwithſtanding CROM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VVELL
had entered the Kingdome of Scotland,
with a potent Army, from whom ſurely they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
little mercy, yet in the nick of time before
they ſhould have fought with him, did this Kirk-Faction,
proudly preſuming upon their owne
ſtrength, and being bewitched with an opinion
of their owne righteouſneſſe, disband and caſhiere
divers thouſands (the beſt Officers and Souldiers)
of their Army, reſolving to carry on the worke,

teaching to fight <hi>Ex tempore,</hi> as they ſhould bee

privately and as ſpeedily as he may, to ſhip away
his traine, his wounded, and his ſick men at leaſt,
if not all his infantry and ſo breake away with
his horſe, to which purpoſe hee makes towards
Dunbarre, where the Engliſh Fleet lay ready;
the Kirkers, (principled in this particular purely
like Cowards, who naturally preſſe hard upon a

to the Army, whereof the remainder now repaires
towards him, and poſſeſſing the Towne and Caſtle
of Sterling, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the Bridge over Firth

theirs in having to doe any thing with Him, that
this great overthrow and ſtraite was come upon
them: His Majeſty well perceiving their villany,
was very ſolicitous to caſt Himſelfe and Cauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Gods Providence, and the fidelity of thoſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
Nobility and Gentry, and to that purpoſe
removed Himſelfe, with ſome of His ſervants,
privately from St. Johnſtones towards them, the
faithfull Lord NEVV: BURGE, Livetenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<pb facs="tcp:35659:15"/>
of His Majeſties Regiment of Guards, with all
thoſe loyal ſoules that would goe with Him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
to waite upon His Majeſties Perſon, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
Him; but by a Providence (working all for
the beſt in the end) His Majeſty was overtaken by
ſome of the Kirkes more moderate friends, who
partly by argument, and partly by their greater
number in Armes, uſe a kinde of violent perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and prevaile with His Majeſty to returne to St.
Johnſtones, promiſing all the Honourable Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that's poſſible; and now indeed, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
(another Power appearing) His Majeſty is
admitted to ſit in Councell with them: But Sir
JOHN BROVVNE with a part of the Kirke Army
muſt needes go to reduce the Northerne Forces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
MIDLETON, His Majeſty is deſired to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them to disband; yet the matter was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by Gods bleſſing upon His Majeſties Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Interceſſions without blowes: The
King they agree ſhall be crowned the firſt day of
January, which being happyly performed, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the New Yeares Centre then, to which all
parts of the Circumference made addreſſe, and the
great worke which His Majeſty begins to labour
at, is to bring all Parties and Intereſts to reconcile
in Himſelfe, <hi>(Hic labor, hoc opus eſt)</hi> which, whilſt
His Majeſty is doing, by way of digreſſion I take
liberty to let you know, that CROMVVELL and
the Councell of State of ENGLANDS New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
<pb facs="tcp:35659:16"/>
this while doe not leſſe beſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
not onely by open force, but by all manner
of ſecret treachery, and Machivillian policy, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
and deſtroy our moſt hopefull King: One of
their curſed workes of darkeneſſe being more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
come to light, was thus damnably contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
MORS, an active Villaine, when formerly
ſervant to Sir WILLIAM ERMYN of the North,
deceaſed, a notorious vermine, that whilſt he live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was alwayes knawing at the roote of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and Viper-like eating away to his owne inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
through his mothers bowels; but he is dead,
and his ſervant MORS, receiving a double portion
of his wicked ſpirit, after his (feared deſcention)
departure, beſtirs himſelfe in His Maſters and
Grand-fathers errand, the more induſtriouſly,
deſigned by the infernall Councell of White-Hall,
(which now is become a den of Thieves, and a
cage of every uncleane Bird) That he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
himſelfe ſince the murther of our King to be a
great Convert, the Engagement to be faithfull to
ENGLANDS Common-wealth, eſtabliſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
King or Lords, he ſhould by no meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove:
So that being wholly diſſatisfied with the

               </gap> to himſelfe, Wife, and Family at Callais in
France, where he had not beene above a moneth
or ſo, but under pretence of his converſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb facs="tcp:35659:16"/>
acquainted with ſome of His Majeſties
Friends, expreſſeth a great deſire he had to go to
Paris to gaine the honour of kiſſing our Queenes
hand, and to offer Her Majeſty his ſervice, which
they very readily encourage him in, and addreſſe
him to ſome of Her Majeſties ſervants, upon which
he comes to the Queenes Court, and was brought
to Her Majeſty, who gave him Her hand to kiſſe;
MORS takes the confidence to diſcover the deepe
ſence he had of Her Majeſties ſufferings, and the
extreame ſorrow wherewith he was affected, for
the barbarous murther of Her King and Husband,
confeſſing he had been ſo unhappy, as in the time
of Warre, to act in his ſphere for the Parliament,
believing their thoughts towards His Majeſty had
been equally innocent with his, which though up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
better conſideration he found injudicious, they
had nothing of that guilt in their intentions of
(which proved the ſad conſequence of all their
actions) His Majeſties death; yet inaſmuch as he
was ſometime ſo unfortunate as to move or breathe
in that wicked way, he knew nothing too hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for him, by way of expiation for his former
offences, to venture againſt CROMVVELL, (or
any other, but) him he looked on as the great
Dictatour and Commander in that high miſchiefe,
and if her Majeſty pleaſed to command him, he
would either by poyſon or ſtob, though with the
certaine loſſe of his owne life, give a period to
<pb facs="tcp:35659:17"/>
CROMVVELLS dayes. Her Majeſty (the Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of Her Sex for conſtant love and loyalty to
Her King and Husband) pierced to the heart with
this freſh renewing of her griefe, in the loſſe of her
incomparable King and Conſort, after She had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected
Her ſelfe, anſwered, that he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that offer as ſome ſatisfaction to himſelfe,
but ſhe had better learnt Her Saviour, and would
not by any conſent of Hers, take the matter out of
Gods hands, who had ſayd vengeance was his, and
he would repay, in whoſe due time, She expected
to ſee their ruine that had committed that unheard
of murther, the Fountaine of Her and all
Loyall Subjects miſery, the ſhame of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and the aſtoniſhment of the known World,
to which MORS replies, that though her Majeſty
was not pleaſed to accept of his ſervice in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
yet, by that, he hoped her Majeſty believed
he would then be ready to doe any thing leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
wherein he might ſerve her Majeſty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a publick good, and her Majeſty he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
muſt needs have affaires of weight with the
King, and to ſend to His Majeſty, as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
ſhe did by the way of Holland, was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine,
tedious, and expenſive, as a quicker diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch;
if her Majeſty could think of any ſervice he
could doe, in that or any thing elſe, he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to go from Calais to Dover, and ſo by land,
much ſooner, and in reſpect of his knowledge in
<pb facs="tcp:35659:17"/>
the North, much ſafer he believed, and would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
his life to carry Letters or meſſage from Her
Majeſty to the King: Her Majeſty glad at all
times to have opportunity to preſent her duty and
love to her Sonne the King, and at that time having
ſome more immediate buſineſſe with His Majeſty,
embraceth MORS his offer, and prepares Letters
to the King; MORS no ſooner receives them
(with promiſe of all ſidelity and ſecrecy) but
poſts away for England; at Whitehall he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
his Black Maſters how far he had ſucceeded
in this dark deſigne, (at which Hell and they tis to
be ſuppoſed kept a private thankſgiving) MORS
receiving freſh encouragement and inſtructions,
hyes away for the North, and in great pretended
privacy comming into Lieth, there hee diſguiſeth
himſelfe into womans apparrell, in that habit cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
paſſeth over the water to Burnt Iſland,
where after he was harboured, he ſends to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
imparting the matter to him, that hee
came from the Queene, &amp;c. and deſired his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that he might be preſently fitted with mans
cloathes againe, and accommodated with Horſes
and Guides to goe to the King, then at St. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtons,
the Governour glad of the employment,
doth accordingly: MORS no ſooner comes to
Court, but there meets him a Major, an Engliſh
Gentleman, who (knowing him moſt maliciouſly
active formerly, againſt the King) ſaluted him,
<pb facs="tcp:35659:18"/>
asking him whether he were a Convert, MORS
tels him the ſame kinde of lamentable ſtory of his
ſadneſſe which before he had told the Queene, and
that the Queene had honoured him with Letters to
the King, which hee was in great haſt to deliver;
the Major joy'd at his converſion preſſeth him to
drink a Cup of Scotch Ale with him upon the
Guard, before he went in to the King, when they
came into the Court of Guard, the Major chargeth
the Captaine of the Guard with him as a Spye, and
cauſing him preſently to be ſearched, there was
found nothing about him, but thoſe Letters from
the Queene, which the Major (leaving MORS a
priſoner) preſents to the King; His Majeſty ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his diſtreſſed Mother Queenes hand, receiveth
them joyfully, and askes for the Meſſenger, the
Major thereupon tels the King what a dangerous
perſon MORS (that brought them) was, of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
ſo implacably malicious, that he could not
ſleep (as the Pſalmiſt ſayes) unleſſe he had done (at
leaſt contrived) miſchiefe, and humbly begged the
King, that he might be tried as a Spy, for he wus
confident he came upon ſome horrid deſigne, ſuch
another perſon not being to be found for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
His Majeſty adviſing with his Counſell,
and being preſſed by many arguments from the
Major, granted a Commiſſion of life and death to
certaine perſons according to the forme of that
Kingdome, who calling MORS to triall as a Spy,
<pb facs="tcp:35659:18"/>
he pleaded not onely not guilty, but rather merit
in running ſo great a hazard, to do the King ſervice
in a time ſo dangerous; but the Judges found cauſe
enough to condemne him, and told him they were
juſtified in themſelves for what they did upon the
evidence given; yet that he might juſtifie them
alſo to the world, they cauſed a rack to be brought
before him, and Souldiers with lighted matches,
told him he was as a dead man already, yet if hee
would confeſſe his intentions, he might receive
mercy, elſe (whether guilty or not guilty
at preſent, muſt bee betweene God and his
Conſcience) they would burne his hands and feet
with matches, as far as they would burne, that
done, they would rack him one joynt from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
untill he ſhould confeſſe, or if not confeſſe,
they would execute him at laſt. MORS ſeeing
death at the doore, and that better dye in an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
confeſſion, then in ſo much guilt to throw bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and ſoule headlong, he, without either the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
burning his fleſh, or the rack torturing his
bones, freely confeſſed the deſigne was layd by the
States of England, and that he had undertaken for
reward, to ſlay innocent bloud; and either by
poyſon he was to have done it whileſt he ſtayd in
expectation of an anſwer to the Queenes Letters,
or if he could not effect that, then, when he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his diſpatch from the Kings hand, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to have given a fatall blow. MORS thus
<pb facs="tcp:35659:19"/>
having confeſſed, being condemned, was remaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to priſon: before Execution, the Lord LO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THIAN
(CARRE) His Majeſties Secretary, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
alwayes for a Juggler with the Engliſh
Rebels, tells the King that this MORS was the firſt
perſon condemned to dye by the Kings immediate
Power, and humbly propounded, how acceptable
a thing it would be to God and man, in his firſt
action to ſhew rather mercy then judgement; His
Majeſty anſwered, that His owne inclination did
naturally prompt Him, rather to pardon then pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Offendors, yet at that time he would not out of
that regard remit MORS, but His Majeſty would
looke upon his Lordſhips Propoſall, as a deſire, and
His Majeſty did not thinke fit to deny a Nobleman
of Scotland, the firſt requeſt that ſhould be made
to him after His Coronation; MORS therefore
for his Lordſhips ſake ſhould live and not dye,
for which his Lordſhip returned thanks to the
King, and within few dayes was repayd it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by CROMVVELL, who had ſent his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
a Letter gratulatory, which comming by a
providence to be made knowne to the King, His
Majeſty therewith acquainted the Earle of Eglin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Colonell of His Majeſties Regiment of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards,
(who is my Relater of the ſtory) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
His Majeſty ſigned a warrant to the Jaylor,
expreſſing, that though MORS were pardoned,
yet that he ſhould keep him cloſe priſoner ſtill,
<pb facs="tcp:35659:19"/>
which warrant His Majeſty left to the Earles care,
who ſoon ſent it to the Priſon, elſe MORS had been
freed; CROMVVELL hereupon by letter diſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the act of MORS, yet at the requeſt of MORS
his wife, being great with child, was contented to
exchange any one of three Scotch Lievtenant
Coolnells (which he named) for MORS: His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſeeing CROMVVELL intereſt himſelfe
ſo farre in the buſineſſe, whom His Majeſty had
little cauſe to believe, to be of ſo gentle a nature,
as to exchange an Enemy for an Enemy (as MORS
(had he been heartily the Queenes ſervant) was)
at the requeſt of a great belly, denies to exchange
him for any of thoſe there, but if Lievtenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
LUMSDALL might be exchanged for him, His
Majeſty would releaſe MORS, and not elſe: CROM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VVEL
conſidering the quality of the Perſons (I
believe) ſo unequall, and fearing all the world
would then conclude him guilty of MORS his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
and bloudy intention, (which upon the former
grant of a Lievtenant Colonell for his exchange,
they had cauſe enough (beſides the native proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility)
to imagine) refuſeth to exchange LUMS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DALL;
ſo MORS continued priſoner, where I
leave him, (without deſcanting on ſo unchriſtian
an enterprize, or aggravating their crime by the
Queenes Candor, which doubtleſſe made it more
out of meaſure, ſinfull) and I heartily wiſh him,
and all that had, or have hands or hearts in ſo foule
<pb facs="tcp:35659:20"/>
an intention of bloud guiltineſſe againſt ſo gracious
a Prince, either by their actions of open and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
hoſtility, or obſcure treachery, hearty and
timely repentance before they go hence, and be no
more ſeen. And I bleſſe God for this mercifull
deliverance of his annoynted our King: For, <hi>This
alſo commeth forth from the Lord, which is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in Counſell and excellent in working.</hi> I take
leave (begging pardon for this tedious wandring)
to returne to His Majeſty, whom I finde to have
paſſed ſtrange difficulties, this while with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
dexterity, and bleſſed ſucceſſe. He hath now,
God be thanked, made a generall Reconciliation,
&amp; enemies to ſhake hands as his friends, the valiant
Earle of Cleveland, and his Engliſh Nobility. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
