         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

NEWES FROM
MINIARD.</head>
            <p>FIve Engliſh Proteſtants intending their
journey for <hi>Ireland,</hi> purpoſed to take ſhip
at <hi>Miniard,</hi> a place ſome 40. miles beyond
the City of <hi>Briſtoll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After they had travelled above a hundred
miles, with many a weary ſtep, drawing nigh to
<hi>Miniard,</hi> even within ſight of the town, though
ſcarce to be diſcerned, in regard the day was
ſpent, and now one houre within night, they met
with a company of Papiſts, to the number of
fifteen, every man with a good ſword by his ſide,
and a good cudgell in his hand. At the ſight of
whom, they were ſomewhat apal'd: yet tooke
ſome courage, in regard they were not far off the
Town, and thought that therefore they did not
dare to offer them violence.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:64669:3"/>
            <p>But it fell out contrary to their expectation,
For being met together, the event well ſhewed
that they had ſome ground and juſt occaſion of
their feare. The firſt ſalutation was this, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
well met, pray from whence came you, and
to what place do you travell: we ask not for any
harm we mean to you, but only are deſirous to
know. Theſe were ſmooth words you will ſay.
Well, the poor men thought no hurt, for true
Charity will favourably conſter all things: and
therfore plainly told them that they came out of
<hi>Kent,</hi> and were going to <hi>Miniard,</hi> and ſo they
purpoſed (if the wind ſerved) to go for <hi>Ireland.</hi>
To <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſaid they, why? that is ſtrange you
would go thither, knowing the eſtate of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
how all are up in arms, and the Proteſtants
in fear to have their throats cut every hour; and
now ſeeing we know ſo much, we wil underſtand
before we part of what Religion you are; for
we promiſe you, we may well ſuſpect that you
are not right: for there is ſomething in the wind
that moves you to go for <hi>Ireland,</hi> in a time ſo
dangerous, and troubleſome. If it be ſo, ſaid the
Proteſtants we are not aſhamed of our Religion
we are (to tell you the truth) proteſtants, and
go not to ſide with the Rebels, but to ſee ſome
friends of ours in Dublin. What do you ſay, ſaid
they, do you call the Kings ſubjects rebels: by
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> you are ſome of thoſe that would ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
us Papiſts out of <hi>England,</hi> but wee will bee
even with you ere we part: and ſo drawing their
<pb facs="tcp:64669:3"/>
ſwords fell upon them, and bloudily ſheath'd
them in each mans bowels, whilſt they pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cryed out for mercy: but what mercy could
be expected from men of bloud, whoſe hearts
were as hard as adamant, and their minds as cruel
as <hi>Progne,</hi> who bloudily ſlew her own Son. The
murder done, a Gentleman on horſeback riding
by, and ſeeing ſo pittifull an object, returned
back to <hi>Miniard</hi> in ſight of the murderers, who
would fain have taken him, if they could; and ſo
raiſed the Country with all ſpeed, who tooke
them in a wood, as they were at their Oriſons on
their beads. O how they looked then one upon
another: what a ſudden paleneſſe came into their
faces. All their devotion was gone in a moment,
and they readier to take them to their heels, then
pray a minute longer; knowing well enough, that
it was but loſt labour to implore the aid either
of <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul.</hi> To be briefe, they were all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>Briſtow,</hi> and upon examination confeſſed
the deed, and ſo were worthily adjudged to bee
hang'd in chains the next Seſſions, where we will
leave them, and come to the Copy of a Letter
which was found quilted in one of their dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blets,
not any of them knowing one word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it, elſe they would not ſo carefully have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
it.</p>

            <p>But again (<hi>my Lord</hi>) as it is the part of a man to
ſupply the Corporall wants of his indigent brother:
ſo eſpecially, he is bound to ſupply the defects of the

            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> it muſt needs be a precious thing, when
the whole world it ſelf is not comparable to it. Were
but this ſeriouſly digeſted in the ſtomacke of a ſound
judgment, I beleeve the world like Rocks and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands

number of mens ſoules as it doth. Your Grace knowes
that <hi>rebus ſecundis omnes feri elati ſunt,</hi> I will not ſay
that your grace is ſo; but I would deſire your Grace
to enter into a ſerious Solilogue with your ſelf, and to
ſee whether it be ſo or no; and if your Grace for the
honour of this world, and outward pomp and glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
have not made ſhipwrack of your Faith, and pleaſed
man rather then God. No better time to bring a man
home then that of affliction; for whereas Martyrs buy
heaven, as <hi>Ignato</hi> ſpake, with their blood, and others
ſteale it with their good deeds through Faith in Chriſt
only, (as a learned Father ſometime ſaid) a man in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction

            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> remember <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> how hee prayed in
