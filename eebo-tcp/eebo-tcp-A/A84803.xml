         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A Paper to Friends, and Others,</hi> AGAINST THE POMPS of the WORLD, Followed and Uſed by many Tradeſmen in their Vocations, Contrary unto many of their Suerties PROMISES and VOWS.</head>
            <p>FRIENDS, ſtand in the Eternal Power of God, <hi>Witneſſes</hi> for the Eternal God againſt the Devil and his Works, and the World, and the Luſts, and Pomps, and Vanities of the World, which World the Devil is God of. Now, there is a ſaying by the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Godmothers (ſo called) that they do promiſe and vow, &amp;c. to forſake the Devil and all his works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinfull Luſts of the fleſh, and vow for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they will not follow them, nor will be led by them; but forſake them all. But do not we ſee, that many that ſay ſo, run into all or many the luſts, and Pomps and Vanities of the World? And are not ſuch offended at thoſe Tradeſmen that cannot trim their Cloaths and Apparel according to the Pomps and Luſts, and Faſhions of the World, which paſs away? But ſuch Tradeſmen that ſtand as witneſſes in the Power and Truth of God, againſt ſuch Pomps, Luſts and Vanities of the World, cannot fulfill the peoples minds, in them: And therefore they are offended at them. But did God make man and woman with theſe Pomps Vanities and Luſts of the World? Or how came they into them? No, God did not make man &amp; woman with theſe Pomps Vanities &amp; Luſts of the World. But when man and woman forſook the living God, and diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and followed the Serpent, Satan &amp; the Devil; then he filled them with theſe Pomps, and Luſts and Vanities of the wicked World, which the Devil is God of. So they fell from the Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God; and diſobeying and tranſgreſſing the Command of God; and going from God, and following the Serpent, he hath filled them with Pride, Envy, Malice and hatred one againſt another; and with the Luſts and Pomps of the World. And they are grieved and vexed one againſt another, when they cannot have ſuch Pomps and Vanities, as others have, and think much at ſuch, and Envy them that are in Pomp and Pride, beyond them or above them. And this Pride, Pomp and Luſt, the Devil, hath begotten into man and woman, in the fall from God. And ſo it had a beginning in man and woman, and muſt there have an End, if ever they come to God. And they that ſtand faithfull witneſſes for the Eternal God, in his Eternal Power and truth, are witneſſes againſt all this Pride and Pomp and Vanities of the World, and Luſts of the fleſh, and the Devil and his works, and cannot pleaſe them, nor ſatisfy them in their Pomps Pride and Luſts of the World, which are of the Devil, and not of God, though it might bring them in much gain; yet they in their Pomp and Pride are offended, and very angry with them, that cannot ſatisfy their minds in them. For, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Luſts of the Eye, and the Pride of life, is not of the Father</hi> (mark, not of the Father) not of God the Father, the Creator of all, that takes care for all, who is the Lord of all. Now if the Luſt of the fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of life, be not of the Father; who is it of then, but of the Devil, the God of the World which lyes in wickedneſs?</p>
            <p>Now how comes this Luſt of the Eye, &amp; Pride of life, and Luſts of the fleſh into man and woman? ſeeing it is not of the living God the Father, it came by the Devil, when man and woman tranſgreſſed the Command of the living God, and obeyed the Serpent, and ſo fell from their Innocency, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs. So then the Devil the God of the World, filled them with the Luſt of the fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of life, which is not of the Father. So this had a beginning in man and woman when they went from God, and diſobeyed him, and tranſgreſſed his Commandment, and not before. So they ſtand in the Eternal Power of God, and Chriſt, who hath renewed them up into the Image of God, that man and woman was in, before they fell; they ſtand witneſſes againſt the Luſts of the fleſh, and the Luſts of the Eye, and the Pride of life; and the God of the World, that hath filled man and woman with theſe things, and hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten theſe things into them. So theſe Tradeſmen that are Gods witneſſes, and cannot ſatisfy, nor fulfill, nor pleaſe, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of life, nor Luſt of the fleſh, which is not of the Father, but of the God of the World, the Devil, whom Chriſt deſtroyed and his works; who through death deſtroyed death, and the Devil the Power of death. And ſo Chriſt's wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and followers do ſtand witneſſes in his Power and Truth againſt the Devil and his works, and the Pomps and Vanities of the wicked World. Theſe are ſealed certain witneſſes in Gods Eternal Power and Truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that which is not of the Father, but of the Devil: And alſo are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for that which is of God the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and for his Glory, and for his Honour, and his Praiſe. But they that are in their Pomps and Vanities, and followers of the God of the World and his works, &amp; the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Luſts of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, do hate and perſecute them that ſtand witneſſes againſt ſuch things. And they who are in their Pomps, will hardly imploy thoſe that ſtand witneſſes againſt them in their Pride and Pomps. So that theſe Tradeſmen can hardly get any Trading amongſt them, whilſt they ſtand witneſſes in God the Father's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Truth againſt thoſe who are in thoſe Pomps and Vanities, and in that which is not of the Father. And in ſo doing they know that they keep clean Conſciences to God; and know, and are aſſured that his bleſſings reſt upon <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem, who will bleſs them with bleſſings from above, and the bleſſings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. And they are witneſſes for God, who hath his upper ſprings, and his nether ſprings to refreſh them, which enables them to ſtand Faithfull Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for the Living God their Father: To whom be Glory for ever; Whoſe Glory is over all the works of his Hands; who is worthy to be Served, Worſhipped and Honoured for evermore,</p>

            <p>AND Therefore it is good for all, to wait patiently upon the Lord; For ſome of you do know, when Truth firſt broke forth in <hi>London,</hi> that many Tradeſmen could not take ſo much money in their Shops for ſome time, as would buy them Bread and Water; becauſe they withſtood the Worlds ways, Words, Faſhions and Cuſtoms; Yet by their patient wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord, in their good life and converſation, they came to anſwer the Truth in People's Hearts and Conſciences. So there riſes a belief in Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that Friends would not wrong them in any thing: So that at laſt the Lord did increaſe his Bleſſings, both inwardly, and outwardly upon his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And therefore, let none murmur nor complain; but wait in Patience and Faithfulneſs, upon the Lord, who is both God in Heaven, and in the Earth, and all is the Lords, who can fill you both with his Temporal and Spiritual Bleſſings.
