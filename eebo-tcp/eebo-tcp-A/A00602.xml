         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue euer, as much as
lay in mee, declined,
and earnestly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and publick
Conferences in poynt
of Religion, with
Romish Priests, and Iesuites. For, Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
(as I haue oft learned from your <hi>Grace)</hi>
is a doctrine of lyes; and as it maintaineth
<pb facs="tcp:2020:3"/>
lyes, so it can be maintained by no better
support, then of lyes. In all conflicts with
men of that faction, though their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
wrastlers, in grappling with our
Diuines, are put to the worst, yet (like
<hi>Pericles</hi> in the Theatre) bee they indeed
neuer so much foyled, they will go about,
by their eloquence, to perswade the Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators,
that they receiued not, but gaue
the foyle. And as <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
a sore wound from <hi>Alexander</hi> in
his fore-head, had it presently bound vp,
and couered with a glorious Diademe: so
when any of their side are wounded sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in any skirmish with vs, their fellowes
presently binde it vp, and couer it with a
Crowne of a surmised victorie. I well
knew, and foretold the Pitcher of the
field, that whatsoeuer the issue of the
combate were, Master Deane of <hi>Carlile</hi>
and my selfe, should be notwithstanding
conquered <hi>in effigie,</hi> and led in triumph
in many a Pageant at <hi>Doway, Bruxels,
Rhemes,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> as since we haue seene
in Letters, and gazettaes from beyond the
Seas. <hi>Omnia praecepi, atque animo mecum

antè peregi.</hi> Yet knowing that truth is
strong in her weakest, and falshood is
weake in her strongest Champions; and
being vrgently desired by the friends, and
personally challenged by the enemies of
our most holy Faith, to appeare as a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
in her sacred &amp; iust quarrel, <hi>malui in
illo praesertim legum et iustitiae publicae iustitio
Iesuitas fractos, quàm despectos dimittere:</hi> I
chose in that high floate of the Iesuites
pride and hopes, rather by an encounter
to represse their insolencie, then by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall
increase their arrogancie. Neither
was the diuine Assistance and benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wanting at the Conference, nor since:
for by it the old Gentleman (whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
satisfaction drew on this mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
was settled (as himselfe vnder his
hand twice professed) and resolued in
that point, which before left a scruple in
his conscience. And by occasion of
this Dispute, the Chronicles of the
Reformed Churches haue beene
better searched into, and some
most vsefull Relations and Treatises
touching the Visibility of the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:2020:4"/>
brought to light, and more publick view
then before. And, albeit his Maiesty, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the first noise and mis-report of this
disputation, seemed to distast it, yet when
the whole truth of that which passed
that day, together with the occasion and
issue thereof, appeared to his Maiesty in
its natiue hiew; the former cloud, which
threatned a bitter showre, was by your
Graces fauourable breath, suddenly
blowne ouer: and then the true Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Conference, finding the skie
cleere, stole wings to, and from the presse,
and flew freely abroad, euery where
checking and controuling the Iesuits false
Relations, and plucking from their heads
those Lawrell garlands, wherewith they
had crowned their temples, for their
owne noble exployts that day. It could
not bee expected, that this printed Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should haue beene otherwise entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Master <hi>Fisher</hi> and Master <hi>Sweet</hi>
(the Popish Combatants), then it was;
who, after a month or two, set vpon it
in print, and dealt with it, as the wife of
<hi>Anthony</hi> did with <hi>Tullies</hi>

death: they thrust it thorow and thorow
with needles, and stabbed it againe and
againe with their poysoned pens; the
one writing <hi>an answer</hi> to it; the other,
<hi>a censure</hi> of it. To both these Pamphlets,
this Reply is addressed. In the former part,
Master <hi>Fishers Answer to the Fisher catched
in his owne Net,</hi> is censured: in the latter,
Master <hi>Sweet</hi>'s <hi>Censure</hi> is answered. And
because <hi>opposita iuxta se posita, magis eluces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt,</hi>

would cause from any heart and pen not

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing commanded by my Lord his Grace of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> from his Maiesty, to certifie
the truth of that which passed in a late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
in point of Religion, at Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey
Linde</hi>'s house in <hi>Sheer-Lane,</hi> in <hi>London:</hi> we,
who were present at the Conference, partly, out of the
fresh memory of such passages as we then obserued; but
especially, by help of such Notes as were taken in the
Conference it self, subscribed by both the Disputants,
drew vp, within a week after, as perfect a Relation of
the substance thereof, as we could: wherein as we added
nothing to the aduantage or preiudice of either party; so
wee omitted nothing of moment, in the Current of the
Arguments and Answers. As for some interlocutory
speeches of the right honourable the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
who diuers times seasonably interposed, and, when the
Disputants or standers-by grew into any heat or distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
discreetly tempered both sides,
<q>Ille regit dictis animos, &amp; pectora mulcet.</q>
—those passages we inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not into our narration, because, the Earle beeing not
then in <hi>London,</hi> we held it incongruous, without his
<pb facs="tcp:2020:7"/>
Honours knowledge, to vse his name to the King. For
other omissions, the Iesuites are beholding vnto vs: for,
they were in fauour of them; wee beeing loth to bee <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
in vlcere,</hi> to bee thought to rub too hard vpon a
gawle, but rather desirous to carry the whole Relation as
fairly and passably as might be.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 13.</note> We had thought, the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
would haue pardoned vs this wrong.</p>
            <p>After this originall Draught was by vs tendered
to his Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and by his Grace deliuered
to the Kings Maiesty, some Copie (as we vnderstand)
was taken, for the satisfaction of a Person of quality:
which, passing from one to another, in the end fell into
the hands of some Stationers; who, without licence or
knowledge of those whom it most concerned, committed
it to the Presse, <hi>de questu magis, quàm quaestione
soliciti.</hi> And the better to vent this new wine, they
set a faire Garland before the dore, intituling it, <hi>The
FISHER caught in his owne Net.</hi> Which Title
was not deuised nor prefixed by any of vs: we willingly
leaue the vanity of such affected inscriptions to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,
who make themselues ridiculous in this kinde.
One intituleth his Answer to D. <hi>White, WHITE
dyed black.</hi> Another cals his woodden Pamphlet,
<hi>The Gag of the new Religion, or of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Gospell.</hi> Another, his Reply to M. <hi>BELL,
Cecidit BELL, The dolefull knell of THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS
BELL.</hi> This is not the sound of <hi>AARON'S
golden Bell;</hi> but rather of the <hi>tinkling Cymball</hi>
mentioned by Saint <hi>PAVL, 1. Cor. 13.</hi> Fancies and
Iigs make no good Church-musick.
<q>
                  <l>Nobis non licet esse tam disertis,</l>
                  <l>Qui Musas colimus sacratiores.</l>

For the Title therefore, wee approoue it not: but
for the Conference it selfe, it containeth nothing but the
truth, whatsoeuer the <hi>Aduersaries</hi> giue out to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
who (as it seemeth) hold it a work of supererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to forge and coyne signall and transcendent Leasings
for the Catholick Cause; for, although the Iesuites, at
this Conference, were often vncertaine, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
very slow and tardy in their Answers, and (in
fine) answered nothing, but that they would not answer
Doctor <hi>FEATLY</hi> his instance in <hi>CHRIST</hi> and his
<hi>Apostles;</hi> yet haue they or their Schollers proclaimed
in <hi>Gath,</hi> and published in <hi>Ascalon,</hi> such a victory as
neuer was heard; much like <hi>the wonderfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
of the superior Planets, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>About a weeke after the Conference, the noble Earle
of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who had bin present at it, hauing occasion
to passe ouer the Seas, and comming to Saint <hi>Omers,</hi>
had the Company of Doctor <hi>Weston</hi> at his Inne; to
whom this Doctor (taking the Earle for a Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick)
told for fresh and most happy newes out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
that at a Conference betweene Father <hi>FISHER</hi>
and <hi>SVVEET,</hi> Iesuites, and two Protestant Ministers,
in <hi>London,</hi> the Iesuites had quitted themselues so well,
and the Catholique faith preuailed so farre, that two
Earles, and an hundred other of the Auditory
were gayned to the Church of Rome by this
Incounter: of these two Earles, the party to
whom hee spake, was one, who could not but smile
at this Relation.

            <p>A pretty Comick Scene, where the Spectator is made
an Actor, and a false person put vpon him to his face:
a renowned and constant Protestant, borne downe to be
a Romish Proselyte. As for the reuolt of the other Earle,

caused that late &amp; lamentable fall of the floar: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
about 200 Papists were assembled, and neere a 100
slaine. They who teach pious frauds, and write of holy
hypocrisy, and doctrinally deliuer the lawfulnesse of
equiuocation, may securely report, whatsoeuer maketh
for the <hi>Catholique</hi> Cause. The more incredible and
palpable the Lie is, the more merit in him that maketh
it, and in them that beleeue it. <hi>Popery</hi> is a doctrine
composed of Lies: and <hi>Philosophy</hi> teacheth, that all
things are fed and maintained by such things of which
they are bred and made. The <hi>aliments</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> must
bee correspondent to the <hi>elements</hi> of which it consisteth:
and verily as hee said in the Poet, <hi>Si ius violandum
est, Regni causa violandum,</hi> if a man must transgresse
the Law of honesty and Iustice, he must doeit for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<pb facs="tcp:2020:9"/>
so it is like they are resolued, if a man must lye,
certainely hee must lye for the good of the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and if lie in so good a cause, lye to some pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>The first report concerning the issue of this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
was of a silly woman, said to be present, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
thereby to the Romish faith, who forsooth stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
vpon her <hi>English Bible,</hi> and solemnly renounced
the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion vpon it; protesting, she would
neuer trust hereticall Translation any more. But, alas!
this was but a silly lye, made by some p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>isne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ouice of
the petty forme, to see how a lye in this kinde would
take. The higher Schollers in the Iesuites Schoole,
thought it behooued them to make a <hi>Catholick</hi> or vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
lye for the <hi>Catholick</hi> cause, by giuing out, that
the whole company of Protestants present at that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
was gayned to the Romish faith, yea, and many
more Protestants then were there also for 100, some say,
400<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the summe of the supposed Conuerts; whereas
there were not neere a hundred persons in both parties
in all at the Conference; and (as wee conceiue) neere
20. were professed Papists, and knowne Recusants: and
for the rest, which were Noble-men, Gentle-men, and
Gentle-women of quality, with some few Diuines, there
was not one of them any way staggered in Religion by
this meeting; but on the contrary, they haue openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that they were much established and confirmed in
the truth of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion by it: and Master
<hi>BVGGES</hi> himselfe, (whose satisfaction by this
Conference was principally intended) who before had
doubted of our Church, after this Disputation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
<pb facs="tcp:2020:9"/>
himselfe fully resolued through the mercy of
God: to whose grace we commend all that loue the Truth
in sincerity.</p>
            <p>As for those, who contrary to the euidence of truth,
and so many testimonies beyond all exception, are yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
to beleeue what the Iesuites report for their owne
aduantage in their owne cause; the Iesuites, wee say,
who maintaine, that a man may vtter an vntruth in
words without the guilt of <hi>Veniall</hi> sinne, so hee be sure
to make it vp by a mentall reseruation: vpon such as

            <p>I Intreat thee, courteous Reader, to vnderstand, that the greater part of this book
was printed in the time of the great Frost; when, by reason that the Thames
was shut vp, I could not conueniently procure the proofs to be brought vnto mee,
before they were wrought off: whereupon it fell out, that very many grosse escapes
passed the Presse, and (which was the worst fault of all) the third part of the book is
left vnpaged. This defect I finde no other means to remedy for the present, than
to referre thee to the letters of the Printers Alphabet, set vnder the Page. Thus
therefore, I pray thee, correct the <hi>Errata</hi> following.</p>

            <head>THE OCCASION
and issue of the late Conference
had betweene D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. White, Deane of Carleil,
and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Featly, with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Fisher and
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sweet, Iesuites, was this
as followeth.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Dward Bugges</hi> Esquire, (about
the age of 70 yeeres) beeing
lately sicke, was sollicited by
some Papists then about him,
to forsake the Protestant faith;
telling him, there was no hope
of saluation without the Church; there was no
Catholique Church, but theirs; and to beleeue
the Catholique Church, was the Article of his
Creed; and by it there could no other Church
bee meant, but the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> because it
could not bee prooued by all the Protestants in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2020:13"/>
the Kingdome, that they had any Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Luther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Gentleman beeing much troubled in
his minde with these and the like suggestions,
who all his life time had bin and professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a religious Protestant, becam now more sick
in minde then body: and if by Gods mercifull
goodnesse he had not recouered of this sicknesse,
it is to be feared he had fallen both from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Church, and his former faith, as some of
the neerest of his owne bloud (to his great
griefe) haue lately beene seduced by like intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>After his recouery, beeing still much troubled
in minde with these former suggestions of the
Popish Priests, he repaired to Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde,</hi>
Knight: who, by reason of his alliance and long
acquaintance with him, gaue the best satisfaction
he could to his said Cousin Master <hi>Bugges;</hi> who
seemed to take content in such his conferences,
and to be well satisfied by him in all points.</p>
            <p>But the Popish Priests and Iesuites not desis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to creepe-in further where they had once
made a breach, perseuered still in questioning
him, Where his Church was before <hi>Luther?</hi>
Whereupon hee repayred againe to Sir <hi>Humfrey
Lynde,</hi> and required some further satisfaction of
him concerning that demand. And thereupon
Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde</hi> told him, It was first in Christ
and the Apostles; consequently also conspicuous
in the Primitiue Church for 600 yeeres after
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2020:13"/>
Christ: after which time some errors crept into
the Church, as diseases into a mans body: so that
the Church, which <hi>Luther</hi> and we acknowledge,
was in generall the same Christian Church, as
his body was the same substantiall body, beeing
now well, and lately sick, though different in the
qualities.</p>
            <p>And for the better strengthening of his mind,
the said Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde</hi> inuited him to his
house in the Countrey, thereby the better to
preuent the daily sollicitation of those dangerous
seducers. And after his returne to <hi>London,</hi> the said
Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde</hi> going to Master <hi>Bugges</hi> his
house in <hi>Drury-lane</hi> to visit him, found Master
<hi>Fisher</hi> the Iesuite there: where, after some debates
about Religion, and the visibility of the Church,
M. <hi>Fisher</hi> called for pen &amp; inke, and set down this
question <hi>in terminis,</hi> thereto adding vnder his
hand, that he would answer vpon it negatiuely,
as challenging and expecting opposers, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
also the paper into the hands of the said Sir
<hi>Humfrey Lynde:</hi> who vpon view of it, answered
that it was an historicall question, and not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for disputation. But Master <hi>Fisher</hi> vrging it,
Sir <hi>Humfrey</hi> told him, if he would goe to Doctor
<hi>Whites,</hi> (where formerly he had beene) the said
Doctor would easily resolue those doubts.
Which beeing refused by the Iesuite, the said
Sir <hi>Humfrey</hi> did then returne him his paper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and so left him.</p>
            <p>About two daies after, Master <hi>Bugges</hi> repaired
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2020:14"/>
to Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde,</hi> and intreated him (for his
satisfaction) to giue Master <hi>Fisher</hi> a meeting;
saying, that Master <hi>Fisher</hi> had againe told him,
that he would maintaine what he had set down,
and that our Diuines could not prooue our
Church visible before <hi>Luthers</hi> time. Whereupon
Sir <hi>Humfrey</hi> told him, that D. <hi>White</hi> and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<hi>Featly</hi> were to dine with him vpon Fryday
following: and if after dinner Master <hi>Fisher</hi>
would come thither with foure or six at the
most, they should bee admitted for his sake and
his wises, who (by reason of such sollicitation)
were troubled in their mindes, and satisfaction
should be giuen as occasion required. And these
were the true causes of the meeting, as is before
declared. Vpon which Fryday, beeing the
twenty seuenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1623. Master <hi>Fisher,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Sweet,</hi> Iesuites, and some others with them,
came to Sir <hi>Humfrey Lyndes</hi> house, into a little
dining-roome; where they found the aforesaid
Master <hi>Bugges,</hi> his wife and children, and others
of Sir <hi>Humfreys</hi> friends, that had then dined with
him, together with some others also: whose
comming in, as the said Sir <hi>Humfrey</hi> did not
expect, so hee could not with ciuility put them
forth his house, but did instantly cause his doores
to bee locked vp, that no more might enter in:
notwithstanding which his command, some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
also came in scatteringly, after the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
began.</p>
            <p>At the same time and place, Doctor <hi>White</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2020:14"/>
Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> beeing inuited to dinner by Sir
<hi>Humfrey Lynde,</hi> and staying a while after, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
giuen them, that Master <hi>Fisher</hi> and Master
<hi>Sweet,</hi> Iesuites, were in the next roome ready to
conferre with them, touching a question set
downe by Master <hi>Fisher,</hi> vnder his owne hand, in

And whether the names of such visible Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants

            <p>This question beeing deliuered to the parties
aboue-named, and it beeing notified vnto them,
that there were certaine persons, who had bin
sollicited, and (remaining doubtfull in Religion)
desired satisfaction especially in this point; the
said Doctors were perswaded to haue some
speech with the Iesuites, touching this point; the
rather, because the Priests and Iesuites doe daily
cast out papers, and disperse them in secret:
in which they vaunt, that no Protestant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
dareth encounter them in this point.</p>

               <p>AT the beginning of this meeting, when

out the paper, in which the question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

requiring rather an historicall large volume, then
a Syllogisticall briefe dispute, we answer, that</p>
                  <p>1. Although diuine infallible faith is not
built vpon deduction out of humane history, but
vpon diuine reuelation, as is confessed by your
owne Schoolmen, and expresly by Cardinall
<hi>Bellarmine: Historiae humanae faciunt tantùm fidem
humanam, cui subesse potest falsum:</hi> Humane histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and records beget onely an humane faith, or
rather credulity subiect to error, not a diuine
and infallible beliefe, which must bee built vpon
surer ground.</p>
                  <p>2. Although this question be grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vncertaine and false supposals: for, a Church
may haue bin visible, yet not the names of all
visible professors thereof now to be shewed and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2020:15"/>
prooued out of good Authors: there might bee
millions of professors, yet no particular and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall
record of them by name: Records
there might bee many in antient time, yet not

our owne question, if you in like manner will
vndertake the like task in your own defence, and
maintaine the affirmatiue in the like question,
which we now propound vnto you heere in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                  <p>Whether the Romish Church (that is a Church holding
the particular entire doctrine of the now Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,

a large historicall volume, then a briefe
syllogisticall Dispute: the more you too blame,
to propound such a question; and my taske the
harder: yet, beeing propounded as a question,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2020:16"/>
I will keep my self to Logicke Forme. But before
I propound my argument, I craue leaue, in fewe
words to lay open the vanity of the vsuall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
wherewith you draw and delude many
of the ignorant and vnlearned. You beare them
in hand, that there was no such thing in the
world as a Protestant, before <hi>Luther;</hi> and that
all the world before his time, beleeued as you
doe: That your Church hath not bin onely vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
in all Ages, and all times, but eminently
conspicuous and illustrious: which is such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
vntruth, that I heer offer before all this
company, to yeeld you the better, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my self ouercome, if you can produce out
of good Authours, I will not say, any Empire or
Kingdome, but any City, Parish or Hamlet,
within 500. yeeres next after Christ, in which
there was any visible assembly of Christians to
bee named, maintaining and defending either
your <hi>Trent</hi> Creed in generall, or these poynts of
Popery in speciall; to wit,</p>
                  <p>1. That there is a treasury of Saints merits,
and superaboundant satisfactions at the Popes
disposing.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Laitie are not commanded by
Christs institutions, to receiue the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper in both kindes.</p>
                  <p>3. That the publicke seruice of God in the
Church, ought, or may bee celebrated in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
Tongue.</p>
                  <p>4. That priuate Masses, wherein the Priest
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2020:17"/>

yee all of this,</hi> and yet eateth and drinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

                  <p>5. That the Popes pardons are requisite or vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
to release soules out of Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>6. That the effect of the Sacrament depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

                  <p>Those things which are defined in
your Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> are to you matters fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoeuer article denied makes a man an

D. <hi>Featly</hi> proceeded.</p>
               <sp>
                  <p>7. That extreme vnction is a Sacrament,
properly so called.</p>
                  <p>8. That wee may worship God by an Image.</p>
                  <p>9. That the sacred Hoast ought to bee eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or carried in solemne procession.</p>

Rats and Mice, may eate the body of Christ.</p>
                  <p>11. That all ecclesiasticall power dependeth
of the Pope.</p>
                  <p>12. That hee cannot erre in matter of faith.</p>
                  <p>13. That hee hath power to canonize Saints.</p>

                  <p>That Church, whose faith is eternall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall,

                  <p>Is it not a sounder Argument, to prooue the
Visibility of the Professers from the truth of
their faith, than (as you doo) the truth of your
faith from the Visibility of Professers? Visible
Professers argue not a right faith. Hereticks, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans,</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> haue visible professers of
their impieties; yet wil it not hence follow, that
they haue a right beleef. On the contrary, wee

that the Church which maintains the true faith,
shall haue alwaies Professers more or less visible.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2020:23"/>
                     <hi>transitio a genere in genus:</hi> such was my argument.
For, faith in a right beleeuer produceth profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and confession thereof, which makes a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
member; and the like profession of many
members, a visible Church. Where the cause is
perpetuall, the effect must needs bee perpetuall.
Therefore where the faith is perpetuall, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
thereof must needs be; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Visibility of the professors thereof. Is this

Prooue by Christ and his Apostles, or by any of

                  </p>

the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>2. That no Scripture, sense or translation

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:2020:23"/>
3. That the Romane Church onely was and
is the authenticall <hi>Custos</hi> of vnwritten traditions.</p>
                  <p>4. That all generall Councels were called
by the sole authority of the Pope, and that hee
might ratify and disannuall whatsoeuer pleased
him in them.</p>
                  <p>5. That the Pope onely had power to cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize

whose name all knees must bow both in heauen
&amp; earth, and vnder the earth (at which words all
the company on both sides expressed an holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence).
After Christ, I name the twelue Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> and because there were few
Writers in the first Age (at least, whose vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>1. About the entry into the conference, M.

                  <hi>Fisher</hi> offred a paper to bee read: part whereof
was read by D. <hi>Featly;</hi> the rest he refused to read,
saying, M. <hi>Fisher, lis contestata est,</hi> wee are already

when M. <hi>Fisher</hi> carped at the word <hi>eternall;</hi>
D. <hi>White,</hi> to try &amp; winde M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> did cast a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme

                  </gap>, to prooue the eternity of faith
from the eternity of the cause, the <hi>diuine predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
Whereunto when M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> or some stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

things might be said to be eternall; another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant

is taken, for <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Apostle saith, <hi>Faith ceaseth.</hi> These Answers

D. <hi>Featly</hi> sufficiently expressed his minde by the

and besides, the disputation was not of
the habit or infused grace of faith, which, Saint

faith, which is eternall in that sense, in which S.

and ingeminating the same Answer, to tax
their <hi>battologie</hi> or vain repetitions in their <hi>Iesus
Psalter,</hi> and other Books of Praiers; saying, M.
<hi>Fisher,</hi> I think, you partly beleeue, that the often
repeating the same Answer, addeth truth and
strength to your Answer; as you are perswaded,
that the saying-ouer the same Praiers, and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the name <hi>Iesu</hi> so many times by tale, addeth

                  <p>What fault can you finde with the often
repeating the name <hi>Iesu?</hi> Doth not the holy Ghost in the
Scripture diuers times reiterate the Attribute <hi>Holy,</hi>
saying, <hi>Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus?</hi>

                  <p>Is there no difference between the
repeating the word <hi>Holy</hi> or <hi>Sanctus</hi> three times,

                  <p>In one of <hi>Dauid</hi>'s Psalms, these words,

                  <p>It is true: these words, <hi>for his mercie

as the burden of that heauenly Song: but
note withall, M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> that something commeth
betwixt, and that this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> or clause is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in euery verse to a seuerall blessing of God
there remembred: what is this to the saying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuately,

                     <hi>Iesu, Iesu, Iesu,</hi> forty times in a breath.
If this be not the vain repetition or babbling for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden

not what it is.</p>

                     <hi>M.</hi> Sweet.</speaker>
                  <p>It matters not. You are no lawfull Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>To which words as D. <hi>Featly</hi> was making a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
hee was recalled by the company, to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his main Argument.</p>
                  <p>Heer you may obserue by the way, that M. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher</hi>
saw well enough, that M. <hi>Sweets</hi> instance of
the thrice repeating the name <hi>Sanctus,</hi> was very
friuolous, and impertinently brought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their vain repeating the name <hi>Iesu,</hi> so many
score of times together in their Psalter: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee let M. <hi>Sweet</hi> shift for himself, and make
good his instance, if he were able: for, M. <hi>Fisher</hi>
could not be ignorant, that the Fathers generally
obserue, against the Arrians, the mystery of the
Trinity of Persons to be implied in the thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
the word <hi>Sanctus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 6.</note> If the Papists repeat
the name <hi>Iesu</hi> to the like purpose (as they must
doo,<note place="margin">Apoc. 4.</note> if they take that for their pattern), will it
not follow, that forty times repeating the name
<hi>Iesus,</hi> implies, that there are forty Persons in <hi>Iesu?</hi>
So well did M. <hi>Sweet</hi> keep his owne pretended
law, that none should speak any thing but to the
purpose: but, because hee challenged to haue
made such a law himself, peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture he thought,
he might dispense with it.</p>
                  <p>4. In the prosecution of the mayne Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2020:29"/>
when Master <hi>Fisher,</hi> being required to
giue a direct and punctuall answer to some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in the Syllogisme, digressed from the
point, and discoursed, how an ignorant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
man might first come to the knowledge
of the true Church, and was checked by Doctor
<hi>Featly,</hi> saying, This is not now to the purpose: M.
<hi>Chamberlane</hi> sitting by, added, <hi>The lesse to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
the better. Would you haue Master</hi> Fisher <hi>speake
to the purpose?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. In making way to the Induction, when D.
<hi>Featly</hi> was recalled, by a new Answer of Master
<hi>Fishers,</hi> to some former Argument which Doctor
<hi>Featly</hi> went about to refell, the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwick</hi>
aduised him, notwithstanding this interruption,
to proceed to his induction; saying, Master <hi>Fisher,
like a woman, will haue the last word, but it makes no
matter; let him answer what hee will; wee presume,
his answers will bee but like his former.</hi>

                  <p>I slander you not. The word <hi>transeat,</hi>

not, then deny it, and I will presently proue it.</p>
                  <p>But as for this word <hi>transeat,</hi> though that wee
made a <hi>transeat</hi> of it, and let it passe in our relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet his owne side haue taken speciall notice
of it: and indeed Master <hi>Fisher Lupum auribus te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</hi>
If by <hi>transeat,</hi> he meant a concession or grant
of the proposition, wee desire no more of him:
if wee haue Christ and his Apostles on our side,
what neede wee more? To auoyde this inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

if hee interpret this <hi>transeat,</hi> Let it passe,

But wee spare Master <hi>Fisher, quia vapulat

                  </p>
                  <p>Surely many, that hold Master <hi>Fisher</hi> to bee a

cannot endure. Though in his Question he laid

custody the common <hi>Schedule</hi> (in which the
principall Arguments and Answers of the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants</hi>
were written by the common <hi>Notarie,</hi>
chosen by both parties, and subscribed by their

saying, Master <hi>Fisher,</hi> you are not a fit man
to bee trusted with this <hi>Authenticall</hi> writing: for,
in a former conference betweene me and Master
<hi>Musket</hi> (whose <hi>Assistant</hi> you then were) you
tooke vpon you, (without any commission
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, or consent) the office of a <hi>Notarie,</hi> to take
my Answeres: and being vpon occasion pressed
by the company to read what you had written,
after some tergiuersations you read it, and
thereupon were checked by the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
for setting that downe for my Answeres,
which was neuer spoken by mee, nor any thing
like vnto it: and that I charge you truly with
this vndue dealing, I appeale to some heer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<hi>viz.</hi> Doctor <hi>Goad</hi> and Master <hi>Wats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> who
were present at that conference. Heer Doctor
<hi>Goad</hi> and Master <hi>Wats</hi> affirmed to Master <hi>Fishers</hi>
face, that vpon their knowledge, Master <hi>Fisher</hi>
was conuicted of vntrue setting downe Doctor
<hi>Featlyes</hi> Answers in that conference; and that
vpon such conuiction, Master <hi>Fisher</hi> was forced
to correct what hee had formerly set downe.</p>

               <head>An Attestation concerning some
particulars, set downe in a Relation enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
The Fisher catched in his
owne Net.</head>
               <p>VVHereas the Relation of that
which passed in the Conference
touching the Visibility of the
Church, <hi>Iune 27. 1623.</hi> is in the whole course of
it truely and indifferently deliuered, and rather
moderately and fauourably carried, in regard of
the Aduersary respondent, Master <hi>Fisher,</hi> whose
part, in respect of his delayes and euasions, was
not altogether so tolerably acted, as in the sayd
briefe Relation it is represented: wee hold it
needlesse to giue thereunto any other generall
Attestation; especially considering, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Heads thereof are extant vnder the hands
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2020:31"/>
of both parties; and the chief substance and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
thereof, for ought wee finde, is not reiected
by the Aduersarie. Yet because a Counter-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
calling himselfe A. C. hath of late put forth
in print an answer to the sayd Relation, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(not content to slighten and doubt of some
passages) hath by expresse deniall excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
diuers other particulars, so charging the
Protestant Relator with <hi>crimen falsi:</hi> wee, who
were present at the said Conference, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue
vnto it, could not in equity and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
bee wanting to the support of truth, by our
ioynt Testimony heere following.</p>
               <p>1. The Counter-relator auoucheth,<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> that <hi>There,
(viz.</hi> in the beginning,) <hi>and not in the end of the
Disputation, Doctor</hi> Featly <hi>did say, I wish, I warne, I
command, I coniure you, &amp;c.</hi> Heerein wee finde a
double falsification. The first, by deniall of that
which, to our perfect remembrance, was by D.
<hi>Featly</hi> spoken to Master <hi>Fisher</hi> in the end of the
disputation; when Master <hi>Fisher,</hi> hauing bin often
vrged to answer the Instance in Christ and his
Apostles in the first Age, yet peremptorily refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Whereupon, Doctor <hi>Featly,</hi> with a lowd
and earnest voice, said vnto him: <hi>I charge and
adiure you, as you will answer it before Christ himselfe
at the day of Iudgement, answer now vpon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
Whether you beleeue that Christ &amp; his Apostles
taught our faith or yours?</hi> The second falshood
is, by adding and peruerting that which was
said in the beginning of the disputation by D.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2020:32"/>
                  <hi>Featly,</hi> without any mention of the <hi>day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or coniuring,</hi> much lesse <hi>commanding;</hi> which
had bin vnciuill. All that hee then said to such
purpose, was this: <hi>I desire you, Master</hi> Fisher, <hi>to
answer in this disputation to my Arguments directly
and sincerely, as in the sight of God.</hi> Which condition
Master <hi>Fisher</hi> did then accept, and required the
like dealing from Doctor <hi>Featly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In the same page is added a second Lawe,<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note>
as enacted by Master <hi>Sweet,</hi> that <hi>Nothing should
bee spoken or heard, but to the purpose.</hi> Which rule
(though requirable &amp; seasonable in all Disputes
or Tractates), yet was not mentioned by Master
<hi>Sweet,</hi> nor prescribed by any other in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
The second then-mentioned Rule was,
as is set downe in the first Printed Relation, that
<hi>None should speake but the Disputants.</hi> Vpon which,
diuers of the Protestant side, both Diuines and
others, did forbeare to interpose by way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>3. This Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nter-relator is so bold,<note place="margin">Pag. 16.</note> as flatly to
deny that which vpon our certaine knowledge
wee testify; Namely, that to the points of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
instanced by Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> as nouelties,
Master <hi>Sweet</hi> (interrupting him, before hee had
recited all of them) answered, <hi>These are scholasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
points, not fundamentall;</hi> And secondly, that
heereupon Doctor <hi>White</hi> forthwith replyed
with this Argument: These points are defined
in your Councell of <hi>Trent;</hi> therefore they are to
you fundamentall; adding also expresly this
Syllogisme:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:2020:32"/>
Whatsoeuer denied makes a man an Heretick,
is fundamentall.</p>
               <p>But the deniall of any of these, makes a man
an Heretick with you:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> euery one of these is to you fundamental.</p>
               <p>To which Syllogisme, beeing aloud and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
vttered by D. <hi>White,</hi> nothing at all was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
               <p>4. With the same boldnes,<note place="margin">Page 16.</note> in the same page
it is denied, that D. <hi>Featly</hi> vsed these words, <hi>Name
but one Father, one Writer of note, who held the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
there named</hi> (being points of Popery) <hi>for
fiue hundred yeers after Christ.</hi> Which words were
vttered by him distinctly and audibly, and (as it
seemed to vs) out of certaine Notes in a paper
which he then had before him.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Item,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 20.</note> howsoeuer M. <hi>Fisher</hi> might (as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
he now interpreteth himselfe) mean <hi>quoad
nos,</hi> when he said, that A demonstration <hi>à posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori</hi>
is better than <hi>à priori,</hi> yet in the disputation he
spake those words absolutely, and without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
For which words so absolutely deliuered,
M. <hi>Fisher</hi> being then taxed by M. <hi>Ailesbury,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 32.</note> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue
in Academicall learning; M. <hi>Boulton,</hi> a
Romanist, with indignation replied vpon M.
<hi>Ailesbury</hi> in this manner: <hi>Think you your self better
learned, than M.</hi> Fisher? Whereto the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
made Answer, <hi>I thought you wiser, than to
ask me such a Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>Item,</hi> though they in generall tearms deny
D. <hi>White</hi> to haue spoken in the manner set down,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2020:33"/>
or to haue vsed any such long discourse, yet wee
very well remember, that D. <hi>White</hi> did then vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
the said Iesuites with those their apparent
tergiuersations, and hindring the Opponent
from proceeding in his Arguments; thereupon
also requiring M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> according to the order
set down and assented vnto by themselues, at
length to oppose; the prefixed time, for D. <hi>Feat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi>'s
opposing, beeing passed. And then D. <hi>White</hi>
naming his owne propositions (mentioned in the
Relation), offered forthwith to Answer vpon the
same directly, without any delayes or tergiuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>7. To M. <hi>Fishers</hi> protestation,<note place="margin">Page 36.</note> that he did not
wittingly nor willingly write amisse (in a former
Conference betweene M. <hi>Musket</hi> and D. <hi>Featly),</hi>
the Popish Relator saith, that <hi>nothing was replyed;</hi>
and thereupon inferreth, that <hi>the Audience was
well satisfied of M.</hi> Fishers <hi>sincerity, in his relation and
writing of the former Disputation.</hi> But wee perfectly
remember, that thereunto D. <hi>Goad</hi> presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in this manner: <hi>M.</hi> Fisher, <hi>Whether you did
it wittingly and willingly, be it betweene God and your
conscience: I am sure you erred on that part which was
aduantageous for your owne side.</hi> Vpon which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
(no further Answer beeing giuen), we were
and are so farre from beeing satisfied of this Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
sincerity, that wee rather suspect him the
more.</p>
               <p>In this sort when the Company was willing to depart,<note place="margin">Page 37.</note>
D. <hi>Featly</hi> beeing called vpon (as it seemed) by some of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2020:33"/>
his companions, to goe away, did arise, and offer to bee
gone. Yet in his rising hee turned to M. <hi>Fisher;</hi> saying,
Will you dispute of Christ and his Apostles, or not? To
which M. <hi>Fisher</hi> sayd, I will, if you will stay; and,
stretching out his hand, took D. <hi>Featly</hi> by the arme,
offering to stay him: yet he in this abrupt manner went
away. <hi>Thus the Iesuites Relator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This passage being of most moment, and (as
wee think) the principall intent of setting foorth
this Counter-relation, to abate the imputation,
lying heauie vpon the Iesuite, for his finall refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to answer to Christ and his Apostles, wee
hold it fit, the more punctually to declare the
manner and cause of the breach of that Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>True it is, that vpon the Iesuites often refusall
to answer to Christ and his Apostles, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
auditory took much distaste, and for a short
time expressed the same, by a kind of obmurmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
yet <hi>not by any shout of victory</hi> (as is exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by the Popish Relator). But after this noise
ceased, D. <hi>Featly</hi> stil continued, vrging the Iesuite
to answer his said instance: which the Iesuite pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
refused, persisting to the end, in his
former denyall of answering Christ and his
Apostles. And as for the Iesuites, by word &amp; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
offring to answer Christ and his Apostles, if
D. <hi>Featly</hi> would stay; we (that were present, and
diuers of vs next to the <hi>Opponent)</hi> auow, that
the Iesuite vsed no such word at all, nor gesture
of that kinde: as in truth he could not, beeing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2020:34"/>
not so neere in place to D. <hi>Featly,</hi> as that he could
take him by the arme, they beeing placed distant
one from the other, at the opposite ends and
corners of the Table. Neither did M. <hi>Fisher</hi> arise
out of his place, to take D. <hi>Featly</hi> by the arme:
nor, if he had, could hee then come to reach D.
<hi>Featly,</hi> there beeing many that sate, or stood,
close crowding about the Table, and betwixt
those two.<note place="margin">Page 64.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The truth of his finall and resolute denyall is
so euident, that the Popish Relator (whom wee
take to be M.</hi> Fisher <hi>himselfe, vnder the Mask of</hi>
A. C). <hi>howsoeuer in this place he stoutly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the said denyall; yet, contrary to the rule
of his owne Trade,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 65.</note> Mendacem oportet esse memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,
pag. 64. <hi>hee expresly acknowledgeth
it:</hi> M. <hi>Fisher</hi> and M. <hi>Sweet</hi> did very well to stand
as they did, constantly to it. They still kept the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the point, and would not permit him to diuert,
eyther to dispute about Christ or his Apostles, or any
other point, vntill names were giuen in all Ages. <hi>And</hi>
pag. 65. <hi>hee bindeth it with a reason, taken from
the principles of Hunting:</hi> The reason therefore
why M. <hi>Fisher</hi> might well refuse to enter into such
particular Disputes, before full Induction of names were
ended was, for that this had bin to follow two Hares at
once, and so to catch neither, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as for taking D. <hi>Featly</hi> by the arme
(pretended to be done by M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> for the stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to proceed in his proposed instance) true
it is, that when he had againe and againe inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2020:34"/>
this challenge, and could receiue no answer of
acceptation, hee was taken by the Arme, not to
stay him, but to pull him away; not by the Iesuite,
but by two of his owne side; the one wishing him
to depart, for that the time was farre spent, and he
could not come off vpon better tearmes; the<note n="*" place="margin">Namely, M. <hi>Chamberlain.</hi>
                  </note> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adding also, that himselfe could not endure
to bee an hearer any longer of such a Dispute,
where Christ and his Apostles are refused; and
that he (D. <hi>Featly)</hi> ought not to talk any longer
with such an one, who refused to answer Christ
and his Apostles. And so, the Opponent beeing
called off, or rather pulled off, the Conference
brake vp.</p>
               <p>These aboue-testified particulars, beeing so
vndoubtedly knowne, and perfectly remembred
by vs, and many others; wee cannot conceiue
how the Iesuite can possibly salue those his
grosse denyals of them, but by the new subtile
deuice of refining a lye by Equiuocation, and
calcining any speech of their own, though neuer
so base and drossy a fiction, in the forging fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
of mentall reseruation.</p>

               <hi>Ludouicus Viues</hi>

The Christian Religion neuer refuseth
touch of argument: but the Gentiles of

all triall by disputation; nay, they
prohibit it vnder paine of death.</p>
            <p>The Hussites, as <hi>Cocleus</hi> relates in their

I am now to buckle with those who take
the matter &amp; manner of this conference
to task: against which, as I vnderstand
by you, they obiect, that it was but a
Flourish, no Fight; a <hi>praeludium,</hi> and no
true Encounter; no Argument in it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
to the full. This obiection might
haue been spared, because in the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
it self it is confessed, that it grew
not to that maturity, nor attained that
progresse or issue which was desired: and
there also it is expressed, whose fault it
was. If a heauy and dull Beast, in rich
trappings and furniture, making great
shew of metall by rising and curuetting,
yet, beeing spurred and lashed by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and beaten by all the standers by, wil
not mend his pase, what disparagement
is this to the Rider?</p>
            <p>Howsoeuer, say they, the grapes being
not ripe, were not fit for the presse; yet as
vnripe as they were, they quenched then
<pb facs="tcp:2020:43"/>
his thirst for whom they were gathered:
and they, who, without knowledge of
the principal Owners, put them in a few
weeks so often in the presse, affirme, that
the wine<note n="*" place="margin">Qui me ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit Bibliopola negat. <hi>Martial.</hi> Epigr.</note> lyes not vpon their hand. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this and some other testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
of some kind of approbation of
this rather assay, then performance, I had
buried this <hi>Embryo</hi> as soone as it was
borne: and as it came into the world
without a Midwife; so it should
haue gone out of the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Bel-man, had not the slanderous
tongues of enemies saued the life of
it: who, both in <hi>England</hi> and beyond
the seas, reported confidently, that it
was such a mis-shapen and deformed
monster, that the parents were ashamed
it should see the Sunne. To checke these
most false and iniurious reports, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
future scandall, it was in a manner
necessarie, that this pamphlet should bee
suffered to fly abroad. And now that it is
abroad, what doe they libell against this
little Impe, vnable to defend it self against
such strife of tongues? They say, In it the
<pb facs="tcp:2020:43"/>
proofes are diuersiue, and that I decline
the method required by Master <hi>Fisher,</hi>
plainely to proue the visibilitie of our
Church, by producing Catalogues of
names in al ages, beginning from <hi>Luther;</hi>
and so, ascending vpwards to Christ and
his Apostles. When I read this obiection
in your letter, I could scarce forbeare
laughing, because it brought to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
the simple Answer of a
fresh-water souldiour; who, when his
Antagonist remembred him with a
smart blowe or two vpon his head and
thighes, exclaimed, <hi>What, man? Canst
thou not see my buckler? Is not my buckler
broad enough?</hi> I saw M. <hi>Fishers</hi> buckler,
and withall I obserued his blind sides, at

Satan was let loose, the Papists haue
much to say for the visibility, yea and
<pb facs="tcp:2020:44"/>
pomp too of their degenerating Church:
but in the Primitiue tymes, especially in
the golden Age, in which Christ and his
Apostles, and their immediate successors
and Scholars liued and died, they haue no
more to say for the visibilitie of their

turned quite out of the way: You should
haue proued one thing, and you proued
another. The question was of the visibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Church: but your arguments were
of the eternity of faith. Is not this thiug

&amp; you spake of Onions. For this vnsauory
exception, M. <hi>Sweet</hi> was sauced in the
conference: where it was proued against
him, that to proue an effect by the cause,
is a direct &amp; naturall, and not a diuersiue
proofe. My argument standeth thus:</p>
            <p>The true Primitiue faith, once giuen
to the Saints, hath had, must, and shall
haue alwaies visible Professors thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2020:45"/>
But the faith of the Protestant Church
is the true Primitiue faith, once giuen to
the Saints:</p>
            <p>Therefore the Protestant faith hath
had, and shall haue alwaies visible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
thereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident in Scripture, and
confessed on all hands. The <hi>Minor</hi> I offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

passing without controll, none but
Master <hi>Fisher</hi> would haue denied or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
vpon the conclusion. This
argument I affirme not onely direct, to
proue the conclusion denied; but also
most pertinent to the maine scope of the
question, which is, to finde out the true
Church: whereof there can be no sound
and infallible proofe, but out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And for the visibility of the true
Church, either it is a matter of faith, or
not. If not, what need wee so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our selues with it? If it bee matter of
faith,<note n="*" place="margin">De praescr. contr. Haeret. c. 16.</note>

perswade in matter of faith, then
<pb facs="tcp:2020:45"/>
out of the Writ of faith, that is, the holy
Scripture? For humane Stories and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
in al ages, they are not easily found:
and when we haue found them, we find
them so defectiue, so corrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced,
and oftentimes so contrary one to

faith. If no man can bee saued, without
knowledge that he is in the true Church:
and no man can knowe, that he is in the

of good Authours, the perpetuall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
and visibility of the Church
to which hee adhereth, as Iesuites make
their breake-neck <hi>climax</hi> or <hi>gradation;</hi>
what shall become of many millions of
Christians in their owne Church, who
neither haue time, nor meanes, nor lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to search all Records of Antiquitie?
Could all Lay Papists produce Writers in
all Ages, who maintained the present
Tridentine faith (which none yet of the
their learned Clerks euer did, or could,)
<pb facs="tcp:2020:46"/>
yet they are little neerer: For Iewes and
Paynims, and it may bee, diuers sorts of
Hereticks can proue too many visible
professors of their Heresies and impieties
in all ages, since Christ and his Apostles
times, and some before. From visibility
of Professors no man can certainely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
truth of sauing Doctrine confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to Scriptures: but from confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Doctrine to the scriptures, a man
may by infallible consequence, grounded
vpon Gods promises to his Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
perpetuall visibility of professors,
more or lesse. And therefore the course I
tooke, is not onely the streight, but the
easiest and onely certaine way to bring vs
to the true Church, which is the<note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15</note> 
               <hi>house of
the liuing God, the pillar and ground of truth.</hi>
Thus much for proofe of my proofe by
syllogism. I wil now giue you an account
of my Catalogue, and shew my induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to my induction. Against which,
I heare by you, it is excepted, that in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking

take a way by my self, where I shall sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb facs="tcp:2020:46"/>
To this obiection, the ciuil Law furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth

before-hand, especially of the successe of
anothers labours. If leaue be procured for

succession, which I tooke hold of from
Christs blessed hand, and his Apostles,
shall be drawne downe (God willing) to
later Ages, euen to <hi>Luthers</hi> time. But what
they meane by holding the beaten way,
I cannot easily diuine. If they mean, that I

                     <p>Protestants in faith and doctrine are of two
sorts; either</p>
                     <p>Implicitely, and vertually: and such are all
those, who holding the Scripture for the
<pb facs="tcp:2020:51"/>
sole and entire rule of faith, condemn
consequently all doctrines of faith,
against or besides the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
especially if they deliuer such
positions and doctrines, from whence
by necessary and infallible conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
some particular error or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Romish Church (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not perhaps sprung vp in
their time) may bee refelled.</p>
                     <p>Or explicitly, and actually: and
such are they, who directly &amp; profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
opposed Romish errors as they
crept in, or not long after; especially
those who opposed the whole masse
of Popish errors and superstitions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they grew to a ripe sore, fit to bee
lanced, about the time of <hi>Luther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this question, wee restraine not the name
<hi>Protestants,</hi> to those who renounce <hi>all</hi> the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
errors of the present <hi>Romish church</hi> at this day:
for such Protestants could not bee much before
<hi>Luther.</hi> The particular diseases must in nature
bee presupposed, before a particular remedy can
bee applyed vnto them. Reformation necessarily
presupposeth a disorder, and deformation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe wee restraine the name Protestants, to
such only as in particular set themselues directly
and professedly against some speciall error of
Popery, as of <hi>Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
&amp;c.</hi> for such professed opposing, could not
<pb facs="tcp:2020:51"/>
bee imagined, before such errors were in beeing.
But as the Fathers, before the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi>
did not in words define <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or that the Son
was of the same substance with the Father, and
not <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> onely, that is, of a like substance; nor
professedly wrote against the Heresie of <hi>Arius</hi>
by name:<note place="margin">Homoousiani.</note> yet are they rightly esteemed <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
indeed, or maintainers of the right beliefe,
touching the <hi>consubstantiality</hi> of the Sonne to the
Father; because out of their Sentences and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
this truth may be deduced, howsoeuer it be

So all those are to bee esteemed Protestants,
who, holding nothing against the protestant faith,
deliuer some doctrines, and positions, from
which some error of Popery or other may bee
cleerly refuted, whether such error were then
maintained by any in the Church of God, or no.</p>

say, What makes this obseruation for the

way. It furnisheth vs both with a strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue
weapon, and offensiue also. The defensiue
may be thus framed:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="margQuotes">That Church which hath beene perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
massacred, wasted, and driuen to
great extremity, and reduced to a small

the state thereof is described in her later
Ages.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="margQuotes">But the Protestant Church, especially
since the 1000 yeere after Christ, hath
beene persecuted, massacred, wasted, and
driuen to great extremity, and reduced to
a small number:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="margQuotes">Therefore the Protestant Church in

                     </p>
                     <p>We may also on this Anuil shape an offensiue

                     <p>
                        <hi rend="margQuotes">The true Church, in the later Ages

                     <p>

their Church, vnder heathen and Arrian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
<pb facs="tcp:2020:60"/>
hath beene grieuously persecuted, I
reply:</p>
                     <p>First, that those who suffered Martyrdome in
those daies, were rather our Martyrs then, theirs,
because they sealed with their bloud, the truth
of Scripture-Doctrine, and not of Popish tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or additions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, those blessed Martyrs suffered in the
first Ages of the Church, long before the 1000
yeere, in which Satan was let loose: but wee
speake of the persecutions of the true Church in
her latter Ages. Therefore when the Papists in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultingly
demand of vs, Where appeared your
Church in the Ages before <hi>Luther?</hi> the best
way to represse their insolency, is, to put a crosse
interrogatorie to them, Where did your Church
lie hid? When did it <hi>fly into the Wildernesse, for the

heads, and tenne hornes,</hi> push at it? In the raigne
of what Popes did the <hi>red Dragon cast a flood of

it appeareth vpon their owne records, how the

those of the first rank only, but admit also of those
of the second. For, as when the people at<note n="*" place="margin">Bodin. <hi>de rep. ex</hi> Liuio.</note> 
                     <hi>Capua</hi>
were so incensed against the Senatours, that they
had a purpose presently to doffe them out of
their places and liues too; a wise man among
them aduised them, before they put the ould
Senatours to the sword, to thinke of fitter men
to put in their places: which when they could
not agree vpon, in the end it was resolued, that
the ould should continue: In like manner, if the
Iesuites except against any of the Authors
which I shall alledge in the later blinde ages,
as being not of sufficient credit for vs to relie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in so weightie a controuersie, as the Iesuites
make this to bee; I require of the Iesuites, to
produce fitter men, &amp; better Authors, who liued
in those times; &amp; in case they cannot, then to let
those stand for good whom wee alledge for our
selues: for wee are to take Authors and Records
such as we can finde, not to make such as wee
wish. And therefore <hi>Scaliger,</hi> as truly as tartly,
reproueth <hi>Baronius, quod Annales faceret, non scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beret,</hi>
that he wrote not Annales, but made them
out of his owne braine. A true Record, though
neuer so foule-written and torne, is better then
a forged Deed, though neuer so faire and legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Some later Papists, excepting against di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Authors alledged by vs, shall not disable
those Authors, vnlesse they can make good
their exceptions against them. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:

Some things there are, in which the most

not agree among themselues: and one, in some

belongeth to the very grounds of faith.</q>

                  <p>Vnlesse we admit of such a distinction, neither
we, nor the Romane Church, nor the Greek, nor
any Church now in Christendome, is able to
produce a Catalogue of visible Professors of
their faith in any antient Age, much lesse in all
Ages. And therefore, if M. <hi>Fisher</hi> and his fellow-Iesuites
require of a true Church, a Catalogue
of such Professors as in all Ages held, not onely
the same fundamentall and principall points of
faith, but also all the same doctrinall conclusions
and particular deductions, I must aduise him, in

As the Fathers differ from vs in some things, so
also they differ among themselues: yet, as they

            <head>A defence of Doctor FEATLY
his proceedings in the Conference,
together with a refutation of Master
FISHERS Answer (vnder the
name of A. C.) to a Treatise
intituled, The Fisher caught in
his owne Net.</head>
            <p>AS <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> obserues, that In
the battell at <hi>Philippi,</hi> in which <hi>Brutus</hi>
should haue taken <hi>Anthony</hi> to task; and
<hi>Cassius Augustus;</hi> it fell out cleane contrary, so
that <hi>Brutus</hi> met with <hi>Augustus,</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
against <hi>Cassius:</hi> So it came to passe in this
present combate. D. <hi>White</hi> prepared and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to encounter M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> his former Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist;
and D. <hi>Featly</hi> was intreated as in Assistant,
to deale in a second place with M. <hi>Sweet,</hi> if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
were offered. Yet vpon a cunning trick of
the Iesuite, discouered immediately before the
Conference, it was then on the place of the
<pb facs="tcp:2020:78"/>
meeting, resolued otherwise by some that were
principally interessed in the businesse, that D.
<hi>Featly</hi> should beginne with M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> and oppose
him in the Iesuites question touching the <hi>visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Protestants Church;</hi> and D. <hi>White</hi> (as
there should bee cause) should take off M.
<hi>Sweet,</hi> if he interposed, as also answer in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
question propounded to the Iesuites, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the <hi>Visibility of the Romish Church in all Ages.</hi>
Thus D. <hi>Featly,</hi> who intended to be but an Assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
contrary to his expectation, was made the
principall Opponent in this Disputation. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
that hee might the better manage the truthes
quarrell, and satisfie his Auditory, hee set before
his eies certaine rules, partly taken out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
partly out of the antient Fathers, to direct
his proceedings by them.</p>
            <p>The first rule is<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 2. 3.</note> Saint <hi>Paul's: Let nothing bee
done through strife or vaine-glory. God is</hi> not in the
<hi>fire</hi> of contention, nor in the <hi>whirle-winde</hi> of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but in the <hi>still voice</hi> of them, who in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

ae docere nisi eos qui doceri quaerunt:</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
will not instruct those, who seek not to bee
instructed by them in this manner. <hi>Democritus</hi>
fitly compared truth to a iewell in the bottome
of a Well:<note place="margin">Veritas in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundo dimersa.</note> if the water bee cleere, we may easily
discerne it; but if troubled, it is impossible to
see the bottome of the Well, much lesse discerne
the most precious Iewel of truth lying in it. For
<pb facs="tcp:2020:78"/>
this cause, D. <hi>Featly,</hi> in the beginning of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
as is confessed by A. C.<note n="*" place="margin">Page 15.</note> earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
M. <hi>Fisher</hi> to <hi>deale sincerely, as in the sight of
God,</hi> setting aside all passion, and by-respects:
and when M. <hi>Sweet</hi> propounded that condition,
that <hi>all bitter speeches should be auoided,</hi> D. <hi>Featly</hi>
with the rest, most willingly accepted of it,
and commended M. <hi>Sweet</hi> for proposing of
it.</p>

To dispute without Logick, is to rule
without a Ruler, or draw a Circle without a

respect, although M. <hi>Fisher</hi> were very vnwilling
to be bound to his Logicall behauiour, yet D.
<hi>Featly</hi> had great reason to require it of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he bound himself to it, proposing all his
Arguments in Logick Form, and disposing them
in Logick Method; premising Arguments <hi>à pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> or Assumption is thus prooued:</p>

            <p>The second <hi>Elencticall</hi> or reprehensiue Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was couched in these words: <hi>Although this

               <hi rend="margQuotes">That Question which is grounded vpon an

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">But M. <hi>Fishers</hi> Question is grounded vpon an
euident false supposall:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">Therefore M. <hi>Fishers</hi> Question needeth not
to be discussed, but ought rather to bee explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Maior,</hi> or first Proposition, is euident in
it self: for, to such a Question there needeth no
other Answer to be giuen, but simply to deny the
supposall.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor,</hi> or second Proposition, was thus
proued:</p>
            <p>First, if the names of all Professors are not, nor
euer were, vpon Record, then M. <hi>Fishers</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
is false, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>A Protestant Church could
<pb facs="tcp:2020:81"/>
not haue been visible in former ages, vnlesse the names
of all visible professors can now bee shewed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all visible professors names are not, nor
euer were on record, as it is certaine, and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by <hi>A. C. p.</hi> 33.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore Master</hi> Fishers <hi>supposall is false;</hi> viz.
<hi>that</hi> A Protestant Church could not haue been visible in
former ages vnlesse the names of those visible Professors
could be shewed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, if all ancient Records are not now
extant, then it is no good Argument, to say,</hi> The
names of visible Protestants in all ages cannot now bee
shewed vpon Record; therefore they were neuer vpon
Record.</p>
            <p>But all ancient Records are not now extant:</p>
            <p>Therefore it is no good Argument, to say, that
because the names of visible Protestants in all
Ages cannot now bee shewed vpon Record;
therefore they were neuer vpon Record.</p>
            <p>These Arguments Master <hi>Fisher</hi> passed by
with a drie foot, and by his silence granteth it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the people of <hi>Africa</hi> mentioned
by <hi>Pliny,</hi> were visible men, yet cannot their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
names be shewed &amp; proued out of good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors:
for, good Authors report, they had no
proper names at all. With this rather tentatiue
then serious instance, M. <hi>Fisher</hi> and Master <hi>Sweet</hi>
were blankt: but Master <hi>Boulton,</hi> though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
in effect, that they were gon at the <hi>common
Law:</hi> yet he sought to relieue them by the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
by saying, that <hi>Though those people had no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb facs="tcp:2020:82"/>
names, yet they had some descriptions, and might
bee knowne by some periphrasis.</hi> But it may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,</p>
            <p>1. A description or periphrasis is no proper
name.</p>
            <p>2. They cannot produce out of any good
Authors, any particular description of these
men, whereby they may bee personally and
indiuidually distinguished one from another;
but onely a generall description, that <hi>They are a
people in</hi> Africa, <hi>neere the hill</hi> Atlas, <hi>which haue
no proper names;</hi> and thus it will bee easie to
produce Protestants in all ages, in a generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of certaine men, who opposed certaine
errors against, and besides the Doctrine of
Scripture, and especially the errors of the
Church of Rome.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Author and Head of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
called <hi>Acephali,</hi> was a visible man, but his
name cannot bee shewed and prooued out of
good Authors: for those Hereticks were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>Acephali,</hi> or headless, because the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Author and Head of that Heresie could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

pay Master <hi>Fisher</hi> with his owne coyne, a man
might truly say, that <hi>both himselfe,</hi> and his <hi>as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi>
Master <hi>Boulton,</hi> were all <hi>nonplussed</hi> with this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for they replied nothing to it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the falshood of Master <hi>Fishers</hi> supposall
(the defence whereof Master <hi>Sweet</hi> rashly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke
<pb facs="tcp:2020:82"/>
in the conference) may bee farther
manifested by diuers other instances; as</p>
            <p>First, there were 7000. in <hi>Elias</hi> time, who <hi>neuer
bowed their knee to Baal:</hi> yet their names cannot be
shewed nor prooued out of good Authors.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there were who opposed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
glosses of the Scribes and Pharises, and
their false doctrine, or at least assented not vnto it,
in the age immediatly before Christs Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
yet their names cannot bee shewed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
out of good Authors.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the first brocher of the errors touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the proceeding of the holy Ghost, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of the schism and rent between the Greek
and Latine Churches, were visible men, yet their
names cannot bee shewed and proued out of
good Authors.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they who first brought into the
Church the administration of the Sacrament vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one kinde onely, were visible men: yet the
names of<note n="*" place="margin">Greg de <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</hi> de legit. vs. Eucharist.</note> them cannot bee shewed nor proued
out of good Authors.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, there were Bishops in almost euerie
Diocess of England &amp; Ireland, and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
as also Parsons of Parishes, succeeding one
the other for aboue 1000. yeers: yet the names
of such Bishops and Parsons cannot bee shewed
and proued out of good Authors.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Master <hi>Fishers</hi> and Master <hi>Sweets</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
from <hi>Noah,</hi> according to the flesh, were
visible men: yet all their names cannot bee
<pb facs="tcp:2020:83"/>
shewed and proued out of good Authors.</p>
            <p>And here the Protestants might iustly call for
names, as the Papists did in the conference when
their Champions were at a fault.</p>
            <p>First, there were a people of <hi>Africa,</hi> neuer
christned by any proper names. <hi>Names, Names,</hi>
where are their <hi>Names?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, there was an Author of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of the <hi>Acephali. Names, Names,</hi> where is his
<hi>Name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, there were 7000. in <hi>Elias</hi> time, who
neuer bowed their knees to <hi>Baal. Names, Names,</hi>
where are their <hi>Names?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, there were those who opposed the
corrupt glosses of the Scribes and Pharises
in the age before Christs Incarnation. <hi>Names,
Names,</hi> where are their <hi>Names?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, there were those that first broached
the error touching the proceeding of the holy
Ghost. <hi>Names, Names,</hi> where are their <hi>Names?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixtly, there were those that brought into the
Church the administration of the Sacrament vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one kind onely. <hi>Names, Names,</hi> where are their
<hi>Names?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seuenthly, there were Bishops almost in each
particular Diocesse of England, and Ireland, and
other Countries, as also Parsons of Parishes for
aboue 1000. yeeres. <hi>Names, Names,</hi> where are their
<hi>Names?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eightthly, M. <hi>Fishers</hi> and Master <hi>Sweets</hi> Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
descended from <hi>Noah,</hi> were visible men.
<pb facs="tcp:2020:83"/>
               <hi>Names, Names:</hi> where are their <hi>Names?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third <hi>Elencticall</hi> or reprehensiue Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was implied in D. <hi>Featly</hi>'s challenge to M.
<hi>Fisher,</hi> to name any City, Town, Village or Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
where the present Romish faith was taught
for fiue hundred yeers &amp; more next after Christ.
And indeed heer the Title of the Conference
was verified, <hi>M.</hi> Fisher <hi>was caught in his owne Net:</hi>
for, in propounding the Question of the Visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Church in all Ages, he spred a strong
Net (as hee thought) to catch D. <hi>White</hi> and D.
<hi>Featly,</hi> in supposing it to be impossible for them
to proue the Visibility of the Protestant Church
in all Ages, especially in the Ages immediatly
going before <hi>Luther;</hi> but hee was <hi>caught in his
owne Net,</hi> by being put to proue the Visibility of
the Romish Church for fiue hundred yeers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after Christ. And therefore we turne
his owne <hi>Ordnance</hi> vpon him, wherewith hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

him to name them. And therefore when hee

First, <hi>In a true Syllogisme to answer to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion:</hi>
For which you would haue beene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

did not regard; but might haue told him, that it
is not vnusuall, after a distinction made both to</hi> Maior
<hi>and</hi> Minor, <hi>to apply the like to the conclusion.</hi> It is true,
he might haue said so (as you doe now): but is
that sufficient without farther proofe? Name
the place where it is vsuall. I am sure it is alwaies
improper and needlesse: for the conclusion in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
is alwaies a proposition giuen by the
answerer, to the opponent, to inferre &amp; conclude
it in his argument: and therefore it is alwaies sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to bee agreed vpon for the meaning of it,
before it comes to be <hi>concluded</hi> in a Syllogisme.
The Answerer may alwaies distinguish of
<hi>premises,</hi> because they are new propositions
not before debated vpon: but the conclusion is
either the originall <hi>Thesis</hi> it selfe, propounded by
the answerer, (which if it be ambiguous, he ought
to haue explicated it, in setting downe the sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e
of the Question) or it is one of the premises in
the <hi>Opponents</hi> Syllogisme: in which, if there lay
any ambiguity, the Respondent ought to haue
<pb facs="tcp:2020:87"/>
distinguished vpon it before, when it was
the <hi>Maior</hi> or <hi>Minor</hi> proposition; and not, when
being distinguished or denied before by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent,
it is now by the Opponent in a true
Syllogisme made the <hi>Conclusion.</hi> To the second
you answer:<note place="margin">Page. 26.</note> 
               <hi>That which D.</hi> Featly <hi>thinketh to bee a
straine of new Logick, to distinguish vpon a proposition,
without applying the distinction to any particular tearm,
is not so strange as he maketh it. As for example: When
one saith, An Aethiopian is white, neither the tearm
Aethiopian alone, nor the tearme white alone, in it
selfe, needeth distinction, because it is not equiuocall.</hi>

either absolutely, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>Ethiops est albus,</hi> a black Moore is white, to weet,

whole bloud, yet the substance of it lies but in

part of a proposition, in some sort, affecteth the

M. <hi>Fisher</hi> (if you knew it not), that one of the

Proposition, in which it may not bee shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in which Logick <hi>tearme</hi> the ambiguity

            <p>3. You were driuen in the Conference to this
<hi>Soloecisme</hi> in Philosophy, to affirme, That <hi>Media
may be said</hi> directa, <hi>yet not to tend</hi> ad directum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.
Hereto he answers,<note n="*" place="margin">Page 30.</note> 
               <hi>If M.</hi> Fisher <hi>did say these
words, his meaning may bee gathered out of his former
explication; in which he shewed, how the direct end of
the Disputation was not, to treat of particular contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies,
but to finde out, first by other meanes, the true
visible Church, whose professors names may be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Directa, <hi>as D.</hi> Featly <hi>termed them, might in some
sort be so tearmed, as beeing directed by D.</hi> Featly, <hi>to
his owne end, of transferring the question to particular
Conferences, but not</hi> ad directum finem, <hi>that is, not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to the direct end of the Disputation,</hi> viz. <hi>to she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
a visible Church of Protestants in all Ages, whose
names may be shewed out of good Authors.</hi> Of the end
of the Dispute, &amp; how my arguments tended di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to that end, enough hath been said before
in the <hi>Remonstrance.</hi> But admitting that they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not to the direct end, M <hi>Fisher</hi> should haue
said, <hi>Your</hi> Media <hi>were not</hi> Directa, because they
tended not <hi>ad directum finem:</hi> but he saith, <hi>Your</hi>
Media <hi>were</hi> Directa, but not tending <hi>ad direct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <pb facs="tcp:2020:88"/>
thereby flatly contradicting himselfe in
the same proposition: for, <hi>Media,</hi> or meanes, are
said in relation to an end; therefore, if they are
direct, they must needs tend to the direct end.
To say, <hi>Media</hi> are <hi>Directa,</hi> and not tending <hi>ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectum
finem,</hi> to the direct end, is all one, as if he
should say, This shoo indeed is fit, but not for the
foot: This is the streight way, but not to the
place you would goe to: The aime is right, but
not to the marke: The saddle serueth fit, but not
to the beasts back: The knife is keen, and sharp,
but not to cut. For, as a shoo is said to be fit one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in respect of the foote: and the way straight,
in respect of a mans intended iourney: and the

               <p>AS our Blessed Sauiour spake to the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priests
seruant,<note place="margin">Iohn 18. 23</note> saying, <hi>If I haue done euill,
beare witnesse of the euill; if well, why smitest thou me?</hi>
In like manner, the Protestant Relator may
checke you: If hee haue done you any wrong
in the relation, or set downe any thing vntruely,
conuince him of it; if not, why doe you smite
him with your tongue and pen? It is your owne
Maxime, that <hi>No man will lie for the aduantage of
his Aduersarie; or for his owne disaduantage:</hi> but
you here say, that <hi>The Protestant cause hath gained
nothing by the relation.</hi> Therefore it should seeme,
by your owne argument, to bee a sincere, and
not malicious relation. Howsoeuer, if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
cause hath gained nothing by it, your
cause hath lost nothing by it; and if so, why do
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2020:91"/>
you so maligne and persecute, euen vnto banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
an innocent Relation? Why do you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
your Romish Catholiques to reade it? Why
apply you so many salues, both in writing and in

cause gained by the Conference it selfe, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
thereof, <hi>malo in aliorum opinione relinquere,
quàm in oratione mea ponere:</hi> it is fitter for me to
heare, then speak. I am sure, Doctor <hi>White</hi> and
my selfe haue gained much ease by it: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Conference, wee could neuer bee quiet
for your challenges; but since, wee haue neuer
been troubled with you. It seemes, you had
enough of that short Encounter. But you will
say, No blowe was struck home: no arrow was
drawne vp to the head; no argument prosecuted
to the full, at that Meeting. How then could
the Protestant Cause gaine any thing by it? By
your miserable euasions, and manifest flight and
tergiuersation, you, who were <hi>ante pugnam
auidus &amp; tumidus,</hi> were <hi>in pugnâ pauidus &amp;
timidus:</hi> like Captaine <hi>Iohn,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Sine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>

you fled in such manner, why did not I follow

as that the <hi>Atomi</hi> or motes, such as wee now

so like, that without miracle they could not bee

is, that Father <hi>Eudaemon,</hi> reading Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s

               <p>I for my part will not promise to haue perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
and set downe euery word that passed in this
Conference, especially spoke by by-standers, nor to haue

strictly obserued the precise order of euerie passage: but
for the substance and truth of the matter that I doe
relate, I assure, that there shall not bee found any false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
vnlesse it be in some of those parcels which I doe
not relate of my selfe, but out of the Protestant Relator
whose relation ordinarily as I doe not contradict, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it bee vpon necessarie occasions, so I doe not intend to
approue. But, simply relating what it saith, I will leaue
is to others to iudge what they thinke fit of it. Onely
this I will say, that euerie one may beleeue it, so farre
as it relateth any thing which may aduantage the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Defendants and their cause, or disaduanlage
the Protestant Disputants and their cause: for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that no man wil lie for the aduantage of his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
or his cause, nor his owne disaduantage. But in
such things as it hath set downe aduantageously for the
Protestant Disputant, or his cause, there is iust reason
to suspect it, inregard that I am told, that Doctor
<hi>Featly</hi> himselfe (who is said to bee the Author) hath
confessed, that more is said in the relation, then was said
in the conference it selfe: and I am sure, something is left
out which was said, and something mis-reported. This
being premised by way of preface, I will begin to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

               <p>In this part of your Preface, you arrogate
truth to your owne relation, and derogate from
the Protestants: to driue forward your owne
Barke fraught with vntruthes, you fill your sailes
with the breath of your owne praises; assuring
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2020:96"/>
vs, that, for the substance and truth of the matter
that you relate, there shall not bee found any
falsehood. How will you assure this, when so
many persons of qualitie, present at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
and attentiue to it, in diuers particulars
testifie the contrarie vnder their hands? You are
one of the principall Gamesters, Master <hi>Fisher;</hi>
and your credit, if not your Religion, lies at
stake. Bee not your owne iudge, but let the
standers by determine, whether you or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Relator hath plaied faire, and aboue
boord. For omissions, in regard whereof, you
taxe the Protestant relation, they were in your
fauour, and not to your preiudice. But because
you could not see when you were well, and
complaine without a cause, they are now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied:
make your best of them. For additions or
mis-reports to the preiudice of any, the witnesses
expresly cleere the Protestant Relatour from
any such imputation: and if I should fasten any
such vpon him, as you couertly would insinuate,
<hi>essem similis vestri, id est, mendax.</hi> If I were the
author of that relation, is it likely, that I would
discredit it my selfe? This were, <hi>messes meas

conuinced to your face by two witnesses, to be
a false Relator and setter downe of some of my
answers in a former conference: neither did
you, or could you deny it: onely you blanched
it ouer with protesting, that <hi>you did it not wittingly
or willingly:</hi> from which starting hole you were
driuen by Doctor <hi>Goad,</hi> and you haue here giuen
mee a staffe to beat you out of it: for, you say, It
is certaine, that <hi>No man will lye, but for his owne

must needs doe it for your owne aduantage; and

                     </gap>d
sincerely in the sight of God, and as you will answer it
at the day of Iudgement.</hi> A double Vntruth. First,
the words, <hi>I warne, I command,</hi> were neuer spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by me. Secondly, those words, <hi>As you will
answer it at the day of Iudgement,</hi> were spoken in the
end of the Disputation, and not in the beginning,
where you place it. See the Attestation to the
Conference. In the same page, <hi>M.</hi> Sweet <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
these conditions to bee obserued; First, that all
bitter speeches should be forborne. Secondly, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should bee spoken or heard, but to the purpose.</hi>
Vntruth. The second condition was neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by M. <hi>Sweet;</hi> which I thus prooue.
Both Relations agree, that M. <hi>Sweet</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
but two conditions in all; likewise both
agree, that the first condition was, <hi>That all bitter
speeches should bee auoyded.</hi> There remaines then
but one condition. But all the witnesses, who
haue subscribed to the Conference, doe, vpon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2020:98"/>
their certaine knowledge, remember, that M.
<hi>Sweet</hi> propounded such a condition; that <hi>None
but Disputants should speak.</hi> And therefore this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
condition added by M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> that <hi>nothing
should be spoken or heard, but to the purpose,</hi> is feigned
and supposititious.</p>
               <p>Page 16. <hi>M.</hi> Sweet <hi>did not say, as the Relator re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth;
They are Scholasticall points, not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:
neither was there any such Syllogisme then made,
as the Relator annexeth.</hi> Double Vntruth. Wee
haue as many witnesses, both of that Answer of
M. <hi>Sweet,</hi> and D. <hi>Whites</hi> Syllogisme, made by
way of Reply, as there are words in both. In the
same page: <hi>In the meane while, name but one Father,
one writter of note, who held the particulars aboue-named,
for 500 yeeres after Christ. To which instant demand
of D.</hi> Featly <hi>(saith the Relator) nothing was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered:
but neither was this said, neither was it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to answer.</hi> Vntruth: for, the witnesses to
the Conference, perfectly remember, &amp; directly
affirme, that it was said. Besides, this I spake
out of my paper, which I haue yet to shew: and
no one thing more mooued M. <hi>Bugges,</hi> and some
other in the Conference, then this, that for all
the Iesuites laying claime to all Ages, &amp; boasting,
that all the world was of the Popish Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Luther,</hi> yet M. <hi>Fisher</hi> could not name so
much as one man in the world, who for 500 yeers
after Christ, held the Tridentine faith ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
or those points of Popery, mentioned in
the Conference, in speciall; neither doth hee
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2020:99"/>
yet name one in his printed Answer. Nay, hee
dares not so much as name the points, for feare of
giuing scandall to his owne side.</p>
               <p>Page 20. <hi>These formall words which he reporteth
M.</hi> Fisher <hi>to haue said,</hi> viz. <hi>A proofe</hi> à postetiori, <hi>is
more demonstratiue, then</hi> à priori, <hi>M.</hi> Fishér <hi>did not
speake.</hi> Vntruth: For, first the witnesses to the
Conference remember perfectly, that he said so.
Secondly, M. <hi>Alesburie,</hi> the Writer of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
set downe these formall words, which
are yet to be seene in the sealed Schedule. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
M. <hi>Alesburie</hi> immediately replyed vpon M.
<hi>Fishers</hi> words, <hi>Heere M.</hi> Fisher <hi>sheweth his Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall
learning, in preferring a demonstration</hi> à poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori,
<hi>before that which proceedeth</hi> à priori. These
words of M. <hi>Alesburie</hi> are set downe in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
Relation of the Conference, and M.
<hi>Fisher</hi> doth not deny them: and therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny those words which were the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
occasion of that Reply.</p>
               <p>Page 31. <hi>But D.</hi> Featly <hi>did not say all this.</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth:
for, immediately vpon those words of
mine, that the Inference of the effect by the
cause, was not <hi>transitio à genere in genus, &amp;c.</hi> D.
<hi>Goad</hi> interposed, saying; M. <hi>Sweet, You ones lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
better Logick in</hi> Cambridge, <hi>then you shew now.</hi>
These words of D. <hi>Goad,</hi> set downe in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
Relation, M. <hi>Fisher</hi> heere denieth not:
and therefore hee cannot reasonably deny the
former words of mine which occasioned them.
Remember, M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> better your lesson; <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decem

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:2020:99"/>
Page 32. <hi>But D.</hi> White <hi>did not speak thus; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did he, in all the conference, make any such long
discourse.</hi> Vntruth: for, first, D. <hi>White</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
in the beginning of the Conference,
for the last houre and half to answer M. <hi>Fisher</hi> in
the contrary Question, for the Visibility of the
Roman Church. The first houre and half was
already spent: and therefore D. <hi>White</hi> had iust
occasion and reason to call vpon M. <hi>Fisher</hi> as hee
did, to prooue the Visibility of the Romane
Church: And as for the six points mentioned in
the Conference, they were the same which D.
<hi>White</hi> shewed Sir <hi>Humfrey Linde</hi> and mee before
the Conference, and told vs, that he would put
M. <hi>Fisher</hi> vpon the proofe of them. Secondly,
those of the Auditors which sate and stood next
about D. <hi>White,</hi> testifie vpon their perfect remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
that he called vpon M. <hi>Fisher</hi> to oppose,
and propounded those six points vnto him, set
downe in the Conference. In which, because M.
<hi>Fisher</hi> found himself vnable to deal with Doctor
<hi>White,</hi> therefore he makes bold to borrow a point
of Iesuiticall honesty; Fairly to deny, that any
such points were proposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page 35.</hi> M. <hi>Fisher</hi> solemnly protested vpon his
conscience, that wittingly and willingly hee did neuer
wrong either D. <hi>White,</hi> or D. <hi>Featly,</hi> in report of any
conference. To this, nothing was replied: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I suppose, that the Audience was well satisfied of
M. <hi>Fisher</hi>'s sincerity in his relation. <hi>Vntruth: for,
D.</hi> Goad <hi>immediately replied, that what M.</hi> Fisher
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2020:100"/>
                  <hi>wrote, was for his owne aduantage: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could not but suspect, that he did it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
and willingly. See the Attestation to the
Conference.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page 37.</hi> D. <hi>Featly,</hi> turning to M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> said,
Will you dispute vpon Christ and his Apostles, or not?
To which M. <hi>Fisher</hi> said, I will, if you will stay: and,
stretching out his hand, he took D. <hi>Featly</hi> by his arme
offering to stay him; yet he (D. <hi>Featly</hi>) in that abrupt
manner went away. <hi>Vntruth. So many words,
almost so many vntruthes; and, God be thanked,
there are witnesses enow to conuince the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-relator
of a fignall and transcendent leasing
in this last passage. See the Attestation.</hi>

               <p>You answer, <hi>That the</hi> Maior <hi>is not vniuersally
true, for that there may be a Church or company, who
may haue inward faith, eternall and vnchanged: As
for example, A Church of Angels, who, for want of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
professors, are not so visible as the Catholique
Church ought to be. Quid ad Rombum?</hi> What is
this instance to the purpose? I dispute of the
Church on earth: you answer of the Church in
heauen. I dispute of faith: you answer of vision.
I dispute of a Church succeeding in all Ages:
you answer of a Church, in which there is no
succeeding, nor Ages. I dispute of a Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
in all Ages: you answer of a Church visible
in no Age. I dispute of noble Confessors &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
who haue sealed the profession of the
Christian faith with their bloud: you answer of
immortall Spirits. In a word, I dispute of men,
named in good Authors, and Histories: you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of Angels, whose names are written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and were neuer vpon visible Record, except
two or three named in the Scriptures.</p>

that the meaning of <hi>transitio à genere in genus,</hi> is
the proouing of a conclusion in one science, by

in Geometrie; or to demonstrate a conclusion in

in Morall Philosophy. But if your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation

by the head and eares, a Conference of yours
with a worthy Minister, and an acute Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
touching the merit of works. What is this
to the Visibility of the Protestant Church, or a

another sufficiently distant; neither was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

I drew you not to dispute about any particulars,

proposed by your self, to weet, that The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

Church was so visible in the first Age, that
the Names of those that taught the Protestant
faith, might be produced; <hi>viz.</hi> Christ, his twelue
Apostles, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Ignatius:</hi> to whom after
you had giuen your Answer, Whether they
taught our faith or yours, I would haue gone on,
in like manner, in naming the Professors of the
Protestant faith in all Ages. Now then, let the

               <p>Page 68. 69, 70. You alleage many Sayings
out of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s golden Book of Prescriptions,
to prooue, that Hereticks, who reiected the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

and refused also some Scriptures, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted

The sentences indeed you cite, are gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,

as they were in the Primitiue Times; much
lesse, either refused or peruerted any part of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of the Canonicall Scriptures, by addition
or detraction? Wee attribute much more to the
holy Scriptures, and the ancient Mother-church
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2020:106"/>
(of which, <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks), who receiued the
Originall of Scriptures from the Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
then you do: we willingly put our whole
cause in their hands: wee renounce any Article
of faith which cannot be prooued to haue been
held by the Apostles and their heires, <hi>Tertullian</hi>
speaks of. Prooue, that the Apostles, or the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue

held your <hi>Trent</hi>-faith, or those twelue new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
added by Pope <hi>Piu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> in the end of that
Councell, and imposed vpon all Professors to
sweare vnto; and then I will acknowledge, that
the Romane Church hath a good title to the
Scriptures. And if we prooue not; that we hold
the ancient Primitiue faith, wee will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that we haue no right vnto them, nor will
we desire to be admitted to dispute out of them.
Therefore vntill M. <hi>Fisher</hi> or some other, shall
prooue by some other marks, than bare alleaging
of the Popes names locally succeeding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they are the heires
of the Apostles, we haue a most iust cause to try
the title of the true Church with them, and
bring the last Will and Testament of our Lord

to his Maiesties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand)
I did set downe the
truth of the occasion briefely and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
to my best remembrance, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
extant in print. And whereas (fol.
4.) Master <hi>Fisher</hi> saith, <hi>hee set downe two
questions with my consent, and the old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;
the first whereof being allowed by both
of vs, Master</hi> Fisher <hi>wrote, It is granted;</hi> I
affirme, that in processe of discourse, I
then allowed, that the Church is more or
lesse visible at all times: but, that I did
grant a necessity of such visibilitie as hee
intendeth, or that I obserued what M.

               <hi>Fishers</hi> marginall note was, I vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
And wheras (page 12.) Master <hi>Fisher</hi>

compared with the few which Master</hi>
Fisher <hi>brought:</hi> To this I say, that, vpon
my credit, I did not acquaint four persons
with the meeting, more then those that I
inuited to dinner. Howsoeuer, I doubt
not, but that hee is rather glad he had no
more Auditours of his owne side; and
by this time, is more asham'd of his cause,
then of the paucitie of his parties th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

present. And yet I will let him know (for
the small acquaintance I haue among the
Papists) I was able to number full twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of that side present. And verily, had I
purposedly drawn thither so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
the Iesuites ought me thanks for it,
as therein deseruing well of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
cause, by bringing a troup of specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
to view the foyle of our own side, in
a question reputed by the Iesuites so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantageous
to vs: wherin, forsooth, the
<hi>Protestants</hi> (as is triumphed, page 33.)
<hi>are so farre from being able to produce three
professors in euerie age, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2020:109"/>
to name one;</hi> to say nothing of Christ and
his Apostles (for, they were not worthy
to bee answered) not one Author; no
not one Actor that dares oppose two
such learned Iesuites in such a triall. Again
(page 16.) whereas it is said, there was
an vnseasonable motion made by Sir
<hi>Humfrey Linde</hi> to Master <hi>Sweet;</hi> I answer,
that I was induced for certaine reasons,
then to mooue Master <hi>Sweet</hi> to dispute
vpon Transubstantiation. First, the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by did well perceyue, that the old
man Master <hi>Fisher</hi> was much woorried,
and the Auditory much wearied with his
saying nothing, and writing little to the
purpose. Secondly, a <hi>Romified</hi> Lady being
present, and being troubled with those
dull and weake answers, did then intreat
me to interpose, and dispute of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation
for her instruction. And lastly,
I adde, that I had proposed this question
to Master <hi>Sweet</hi> at my house, 8. weekes
before, where his leasure then would not
giue him leaue to dispute of it: and now I
conceiued, he was wel armed for a second
encounter. Againe, where it is related
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2020:110"/>
in the Conference, that I told M. <hi>Buggs,</hi>
that the Church was in Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
&amp;c. The Iesuite saith in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
there,<note place="margin">A weaker Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, as is shewed in the insuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note> 
               <hi>A very weake and insufficient
answer, as is shewed hereafter.</hi> Surely
the Iesuite had a weake memorie,
and forgot a farther Reply; or else
other answer hee could not make to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
it. Neither, by Master <hi>Fishers</hi> leaue,
was it so weake and insufficient an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
as hee gaue me, when, vpon his first
meeting, falling into conference about
the Reall presence, which Master <hi>Fisher</hi>
would prooue out of these words, <hi>Hot est
corpus meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> I answerd, that <hi>Scotus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racensis,</hi>
and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> were of opinion,
that that Text was not strong enough to
enforce Transubstantiation. To which
obiection, hee gaue this Answer as a full
satisfaction to the standers-by: <hi>What care
I for Bellarmine, or Scotus, or Cameracensis?</hi>
Againe, by Master <hi>Sweets</hi> leaue, it was
not so weake and insufficient an answer,
as when I propounded to him foure
questions, <hi>viz.</hi> The worship of Images,
Praier in an vnknowne tongue, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2020:110"/>
in one kinde, and Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation;
with this assurance, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Recusants, that if he could proue
either all, or but any one of those, held by
the ancient Fathers in the Primitiue
Church, according to that forme of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
prescribed in the Councel of Trent;
I would then subscribe to Popery. All
his answer was, that <hi>hee brought a booke
that would proue them all.</hi> So for that time I
was content, hee should <hi>bee saued by his
booke.</hi> But Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> (in whose hands
hee is now) will not let him escape so
easily; but, calling him into the inner
barre, will finde, that <hi>non legit vt Clericus.</hi>
At that time Master <hi>Sweet</hi> farther added,
that hee for his part had other businesse,
and could not intend to argue with mee
about those questions. If his superior had
heard him, certainly hee would haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
him penance, for neglecting so
fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e an opportunitie of conuerting such
an Hereticke as hee takes mee to bee: hee
knowes, there ought to bee no businesse
pretended, where there had been a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to make a proselyte.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:2020:111"/>
               <hi>Lastly, concerning the issue of the
Conference, I auow and protest, that old
Master</hi> Bugs <hi>came then to me, and gaue
mee thankes in the same roome before
his departure, and told mee, that he well
perceiued,</hi> it was be the great brags of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
for their Church; that hee well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
they could say but little for it: <hi>and
withall,</hi> hee did acknowledge himselfe to bee
so well satisfied at that time, that he professed
vnto mee, that if his sonne would not leaue
his religion, and the priests company, he would
leaue him, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>First, Whether the Protestant Church was

desired satisfaction, especially in this
point, they were perswaded to haue

vaunt, that no Protestant Minister dare

               <head>Master Fisher his Answer.</head>
               <p>First, any man reading this parcel, would be induced to
think, that D. <hi>White</hi> &amp; D. <hi>Featly</hi> had neuer had notice
before, for what end they were inuited to dinner, or for
what end they were to meete with the Iesuites; but that
they were on the sudden summ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ned to this Conference,
without any preparation, or knowledge of the Question:
which not to be so, is euidently conuinced, partly, by that
which is already said, partly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by that which I am after to
say.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this Relator would make his Reader beleeue
that M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> vnder his owne hand, had set downe
the words of the Question, distinguished with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
figure of 2. which is not so: for M. <hi>Fisher</hi> did not
write any such figure of 2. in the middle of the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

entire Question, as Sir <hi>Humfrey</hi> himselfe had desired.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he seemeth willing to perswade, that Priests
and Iesuites doe daily cast out papers: which is not
true.</p>

               <p>The Heathen accounted it an ominous thing,
<hi>offendere in limine, to stumble as a man is going out
a-doores, in lifting his legge ouer the threshold.</hi> You do
so, M. <hi>Fisher:</hi> you stumble at the first setting your
foote out a-doore, and (which is farre worse)
you stumble at three strawes.</p>
               <p>The first is, that (forsooth) any man reading this
parcell, would beleeue, that D. <hi>White</hi> and my selfe
were on the sudden summoned to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
And what if he should beleeue so? What
doth this adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage our cause, or preiudice yours?
It matters not much, how wee came to this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
but how we came off. Yet are there no
words in the Relation, which imply any such
thing, that wee came sudden or vnprouided;
nay, whosoeuer reades the first Chapter, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the occasion of the Conference, cannot but
perceiue that wee had notice of it before, and
came prouided. The truth is, for mine owne
part, I knew of it two daies, and no more, before
the meeting; and I excepted against the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
as beeing too neere, and sudden, for a
man to prepare, either to oppose or answer in so

               <p>The second straw you stumbled at, is, That
the Relator would make the Reader beleeue, that
M. <hi>Fisher</hi> put a figure of 2. at the second part of
his Question. And what if the Reader did so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue?
It is certaine, that there is a second <hi>

had it beene, to set before the second <hi>Vtrum,</hi> the

who mistooke the interrogatiue point in the
copy (?) for the figure 2. In the originall written

Where are your names?</hi> D. <hi>White</hi> said, This is nothing

D. <hi>White</hi> called not for names, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <p>My Question is meant to be but one entire Question.
And so, to cut off all needlesse wrangling (made by D.

               <p>Wherefore if you will dispute, you must dispute in

The Protestant Church was so visible, as the Names

               <p>First, the parts of your question are distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
really: for a Protestant Church may haue
beene visible in many Ages, and yet not the
names of visible Protestants liuing in those Ages
now to bee produced, as your selfe confesseth
in effect, page 33. line 23. <hi>Wee doe not require, that all
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2020:117"/>
visible mens names should bee vpon record, nor all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
produced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they are distinguished formally in
words, whether the protestant Church, &amp;c. And
whether the Names, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they are distinguished by points:
for in the middle of your question, before the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of it, you your selfe put a <hi>colon</hi> thus(:).</p>
               <p>Fourthly, you distinguish them your selfe in
your answer, in the written copie which I haue:
for to the first part you answer in the margent,
<hi>It was not:</hi> which answer was not, nor can bee
applied to the latter part.</p>
               <p>Either the parts of your question are distinct
in sense, or out of question you propound them
senslesly, whether and whether, two whethers,
meaning but one. Admit the construction you
giue of the first part, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a Protestant
Church were visible in all Ages, that is, so <hi>visible,
as the Names of visible Protestants may bee shewed:</hi>
what construction then will you make of the
latter clause, &amp; whether <hi>the Names may be shewed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not this iust like <hi>Battus</hi> his spell in the Latin
Poet;

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is as if I should propound such a question:
Whether Iesuites be so honest men, that they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2020:118"/>
will not equiuocate, and whether they will
not equiuocate?</p>
               <p>Or whether the letters in a small print are so
visible that they may bee read, and whether
they may bee read?</p>
               <p>Or whether the parts of this question are so
distinguished that they are not altogether
confounded, and whether they are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
confounded?</p>
               <p>But you say, I am bound to dispute in your
sense. What sense mean you? The sense that is to
be made of your words, or the sense which you
make by your mental reseruation? It seemeth you
are so vsed to your Iesuitical <hi>Cabala,</hi> that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               <p>To this obiection (touching the <hi>Acephali)</hi> M.
<hi>Boulton</hi> answered, that those <hi>Acephali</hi> held some

of a name, sufficient to distinguish them from others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuating
heereby, that these <hi>Acephali</hi> were not <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further it may be answered, that it is not certaine,
whether they had any particular Author: for some say,
that they were a company, who in the controuersie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
behaued themselues like Neutrals, submitting
themselues to neither as to their Head. Others think,
that they were certaine men, who, beeing the Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of <hi>Petrus Mogus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Moggus.</note> the Heretick, did afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
him from beeing their Head, because he would
not accurse the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Others say,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2020:120"/>
that one <hi>Seueius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> was their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
               <p>But howsoeuer this particular were, it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that there could be in all Ages visible professors
of the Protestants faith; whereof no story, nor other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Monument maketh mention of names, or opinions,
or places of aboad of any of them, or of those who opposed
them, as Stories make mention of some of these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
both of the <hi>Acephali,</hi> and whatsoeuer other
eminent professors of euery true or false Religion. Wee
doe not require, that all visible mens names should bee
vpon Record, nor all Records produced. For, although
to prooue such a visible Church as that of our Sauiour

<note place="margin">Lib. de vnitate Ecclesiae.</note>as Saint <hi>Austen</hi> prooueth against the Donatists;
yet to shew how confident wee are of our cause, wee for
the present onely require, that Three eminent Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
names in all Ages, be produced out of good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
But they are so farre from beeing able to produce
three, as they cannot name one in euery Age (as is
cleerely proued in the Protestants Apology) neither
indeed can they abide with any patience, when they bee
much pressed in this point, as appeareth by diuers who
haue beene vrged, and in particular by D. <hi>Featly</hi> in this
Conference; who hauing beene called vpon seuerall
times to produce Names, as hee had vndertaken at one

<note place="margin">About the yeere 480.</note>To beginne with your <hi>Acephali.</hi> These
<hi>Acephali</hi> were a shole of Hereticks, bred (as it
should seeme) of the spawne of <hi>Eutyches</hi> &amp; <hi>Diosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi>
for they held, that there was but <hi>one nature
in Christ,</hi> viz. <hi>the diuine, which they affirmed to haue
beene crucified.</hi> These differed from other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
in this especially; That whereas other
Hereticks for the most part took their names
from the Author and Head of their Sect, (as the
<hi>Arians</hi> from <hi>Arius,</hi> the <hi>Nestorians</hi> from <hi>Nestorius,
&amp;c);</hi> these Hereticks, because their first Author
could not bee certainly knowne, were termed
<hi>Acephali</hi> from <hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifying a
Head; as if you would say, Head-lesse Hereticks.
So that, as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes of the herb <hi>Anonymos, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
non inueniendo inuenit,</hi> that it took it's name
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2020:121"/>
                  <hi>Anonymos,</hi> from the want of a name; so it may be
truly said of these Hereticks, that they took their
name from the want, or at least, ignorance of the
name of their parent and first Author. Thus your
<hi>Alfonso</hi> deduceth, and expoundeth their name:

princeps atque magister.</hi> The Hereticks tearmed
<hi>Acephali,</hi> were so named, because multitudes of
them rising together, there was found none, who
might be their Head and Master. Neither doe
you in your Answer contradict, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
this Etymology, by rehearsing diuers and
sundry opinions touching their Head and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
Which variety of opinions, and difference
of Authors about him, plainely argueth, that no
certainty was, or can be had of him, who he was,
and much lesse what was his proper name.
Wherefore, distrusting your former Answer, you
adde a second, saying, <hi>Howsoeuer this particular

visible professors of the Protestant faith, whereof no Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Head and Author of the Heresie of the <hi>Acephali</hi>
was, I suppose, a visible man: yet can he not now,
nor, for ought appeares, could he then, when hee
broched his Heresie, be named. In like manner,
the 7000. that neuer bowed their knees to <hi>Baal,</hi>
and all your Ancestors descending from <hi>Noah,</hi>
were certainly visible men: yet can they not
now be all named; and therefore M. <hi>Sweet'</hi>s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,

else you would not so ignorantly apply Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens</hi>

we teach with Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> that Christs visible
Catholique Church is dispersed farre and wide
ouer the face of the whole earth. But you are
the Donatists of our Age: for, as the Donatists
confined the Catholique Church of Christ, to

you also restraine the Church of Christ to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the Popes adherents.<note place="margin">

with this difference, some are sound members and

Wee doubt not, but Christ hath his flock vnder

               <p>
                  <hi>Yea, but we are so farre from beeing able to produce
three Protestants in all Ages, as we cannot name one in

<hi>hath prooued it to your hand.</hi> A beggerly Rapsodist,
whose patched cloak is already all to-be-tome
by one of our noble Mastiues, and the ragges
that remaine, as I am informed, will be shortly by

a knowne Papist, to alleage meerely his work and
words, to mee is but a dry kinde of proofe; and
therefore you did well in this place, to knock at
the Buttery-dore.</p>
               <p>And heere I intreat the Reader to note, how
the very name of the Buttery reuiues the Iesuite.
In all the other passages of his Book, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2020:123"/>
that pretends to wit or mirth: but heer he
is very pleasant, now his dull wit is whetted: he
was not able in all the Conference, nor since
in his Answer, to send out such a flash. Will you
know the reason? The Spright of the <hi>Butterie</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth
him, and thus he diuines; <hi>The Protestants
cannot abide with any patience, when they bee much
pressed in this poynt, as appeareth by diuers that haue
been vrged, and in particular by Doctor</hi> Featly <hi>in this
Conference, who hauing been called vpon to produce
Names, burst forth, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>I burst forth,</hi> not into <hi>a passion,</hi> as you
would make the Reader beleeue, but into a
laughter, as did the rest of the company: neither
did I by any gesture or speech, discouer my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
but your folly, who, when I alledged
you reasons and testimonies, were not content
with them, but called for emptie names, &amp;c.
And what was this, but to call for a Colledge
Buttery-book; which is nothing but a Register of
the names of such as are in that societie? If the
sprite of the Butterie had not obfuscated your
braine, &amp; surprized your iudgement, you might
haue vnderstood, &amp; plainly perceiued, that I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
not a Catalogue of noble Confessors and
Martyrs of the Catholique Protestant faith, to a
Buttery-book; but such a Catalogue as you then
required, and you vsually bring, to proue the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblity
of your church, <hi>viz.</hi> a companie of names,
and nothing else; <hi>testes sine testimonijs,</hi> witnesses
deposing nothing for you. And, may not such
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2020:123"/>
emptie Catalogues be fitly compared to But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie-books?
<hi>Note, Reader,</hi> say you, <hi>what a fit Title
hee giueth to a Catalogue of Names of Protestants;
who, indeed, are more like to bee found in a Butterie-booke,
then any good Record of Antiquitie, as hauing
had their beginning of late in one</hi> Martin Luther;
<hi>who, after his apostasie, more respected the Butterie,
then any ecclesiasticall storie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I maruell not, that you, Yeomen of the Popes
Butterie and Pantry, and the Blacke-gard of
Rome, haue a sharpe tooth against <hi>Luther;</hi> who,
by burning the Popes haruest of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> hath
made the Catalogue farre lesse of those that
brued for the Friers Buttery, and baked for the
Popes Kitchin. Certainly, if <hi>Martin Luther</hi> had
so fat a belly as you paint him with, hee did but
hold that which hee got among you: for, after
hee for sooke <hi>Sodom</hi> (which you Apostataes call
apostasie) hee so hated and detested the glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony
and drunkennesse of Monks and Friers, and
so sharpely inueighed against them, that <hi>Erasmus</hi>
sometimes spake as truly as wittily of him; <hi>That
though hee otherwise highly esteemed of him, yet hee
could not but confesse, that hee was much too blame in

The question is not now, Whether our faith or

the question now is of the effect, to wit, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie

say, to that which Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> now obiecteth against
the proofe taken from visibility, that Although all kind
of visible professors doe not argue right faith, yet want
of visibile professors argueth want of Christs true
Church. For, supposing it to bee true which euen D.
<hi>Featly</hi> himselfe heere saith (according to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
Relator) <hi>viz.</hi> wee knowe by the promises of God
in the Scripture, that the Church which maintaineth
the true faith, shall haue alwaies professors more or lesse
visible, and (as Master <hi>Fisher</hi> further proued in one
of the foresaid papers, giuen to the old gentleman before
this meeting) so visible, as their Names in all Ages
may bee shewed out of good Authors; supposing also out
of Doctor <hi>Whitaker, contr. Dur. l. 7. p. 472.</hi> that
Whatsoeuer is foretold by the antient Prophets, of the
propagation, amplitude, and glorie of the Church; is
most cleerly witnessed by Histories; and supposing
lastly, out of Doctor <hi>Iohn White,</hi> in his way, <hi>p. 338.</hi>
That things past cannot bee shewed to vs, but by Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Supposing all this (I say), it is most apparant,
that if there cannot bee produced (as there cannot)
Names of Protestants, or of any other professors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

promises agree, besides those which are knowne Roman

Roman Catholiques are the true church of Christ which

Thirdly, the Romane or Westerne Church
ought to bee distinguished from the Papacie, or
mystery of iniquity in it; which is not the
Church, but a preualent and predominant facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in it. The Romane Church we acknowledge
to bee a member (though a sick and weak one)
of the Catholique visible Church; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
to haue some part in the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
made to the Church, in the Gospell: but
the Papacy, or that predominant faction, is no
member, but a botch or an aposteme in the
Church; to which none of those promises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
yet many prophesies are cleerly fulfilled in
it.</p>
               <p>First, 1. <hi>Tim. 1. 4.</hi> Now, the Spirit speaketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
that <hi>In the later times some shall depart from

their wiues: he preferred harlots before married
wiues; fornication, adultery, and incest, before

chaste marriage. And likewise in the Papacy
that part of the Prophesie is fulfilled, touching
the forbidding of certain meats; as for example,
flesh, and egges, and white meats, and the like,
and that for conscience sake, and vnder paine of
deadly sin, and accounting such abstinence me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Prophesie in 2. <hi>Thes. 2. 9. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
after the power of Satan, in all power of signes

and no where else. See their Legends, old and

is fulfilled in the Papacy, which permitteth pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Stews, I might say, alloweth, because who
keep those houses, do therefore pay a pension to
the Pope.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that Prophesie, <hi>Iude 16. speaking great
swelling words of vanity,</hi> is fulfilled in the Papacy;
which teacheth, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the
Mother and Queen of all Churches; that the
Pope cannot erre; that hee is aboue the Law of
God; that those who adhere to him, can more
than merit heauen: they can supererrogate.</p>

               <p>This Argument, as it is set downe, is so far from
being a demonstration (whose propertie is, To conuince
the vnderstanding) as it is not a probable or morall
perswasion: for, I am verily perswaded, that no wise
man (not alreadie possessed with Protestant opinions)
will or can bee so much as morally conuinced, or in any
sort probably perswaded by it, that Protestants bee the
true visible Church, more then a man (in case of doubt)
can be by the like Argument, which a man may make, to
proue himselfe and his brethren to bee as well spoken of,
as any in all the parish, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">Those who are in heart true honest men, are as well
spoken of, as any in all the parish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">But I and my brethren are in heart true honest
men:</hi>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:2020:131"/>
As this proofe is not able to make any man, not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
affected, to beleeue these men to be well spoken of,
or to bee honest-men: so neither can Doctor <hi>Featlies</hi>
proofe make any wise man beleeue Protestants to bee the
true visible Church, or to haue the true faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the terme, <hi>That Church,</hi> bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
onely of a particular Church (as for example, the
Church of <hi>England)</hi> it is so farre from a Logicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
as it hath not in it any Logicall Forme, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to any of the vsual moods, <hi>Barbara Caelarent,
&amp;c.</hi> But if it bee vnderstood vniuersally of
euerie Church that is or may bee, then both <hi>Maior</hi>
and <hi>Minor</hi> are false: and so it cannot bee a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
whose propertie is, To consist of most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true propositions. The <hi>Maior</hi> in this latter sense is
false, for that there may be a Church or companie, who
may haue inward faith, eternall, and vnchanged (as
for example, a Church of Angels) who, for want of
visible profession, are not so visible as the Catholique
Church ought to be. The <hi>Minor</hi> is false also: for, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>testant
Church hath not the true primitiue faith, neither
is that faith they haue, vnchanged; but so often changed,
and so much subiect to change, as one may say (as a
great person in <hi>Germany</hi> once said of some Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants)
<hi>What they hould this yeere, I doe in
some sort know: but what they will hould next
yeere, I doe not knowe.</hi> Which is true, in regard
they haue no certaine and infallible rule, sufficient to
preserue them from change. But if Doctor <hi>Featly</hi>
shall say, that hee neither meant the tearme, <hi>That
Church,</hi> in either of the aforesaid senses, but meant to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2020:131"/>
signifie by it, That one, holy, Catholique, and Apostolique
Church, which the holy Scriptures doe shew both to haue
perpetuall vnchanged faith, and also to bee perpetually
visible, then indeed the <hi>Maior</hi> is true; but the <hi>Minor</hi>
is most false: and so the argument is farre from being
a demonstration; especially, when it endeuoureth to
proue <hi>magis notum per ignotius, viz.</hi> the visibilitie
(which is easily knowne) by the truth of Doctrine
(which is more hard to be knowne) especially by onely
Scripture. Of the sense whereof (according to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
who say, The whole Church may erre) no
particular man can bee infallibly sure: for if the whole
Church or companie (to whom Christ promised the
Spirit of truth to teach them all truth, may erre, then
much more may euerie particular man erre: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
no particular man can bee infallibly sure of the
sense of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this Argument beggeth or supposeth that
which is in question; for in asking which is the true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church, or congregation of the true faithfull, wee
aske, at least vertually, which is the true faith: in
regard the true Church cannot be without this true faith:
yea therefore doe wee ask which is the true Church, that
of it, being first knowne by other marks, wee may learne
what is the true faith in all points, in which wee yet
knowe not what is to bee held for true diuine faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, although faith be prerequired to be in some
or other members of the true Church, yet inward faith
alone, without some outward profession, by which it is
made visible or sensible, doth not sufficiently make a
man to bee a member of the visible Church.</p>

that you may call vpon Saints.</p>
               <p>Eightthly, we beleeue, that Christ is our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,

               <p>Ninthly, we beleeue; that the Saints departed

haue knowledge of our particular necessities, and
pray to God in speciall for vs.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, we beleeue, that Christ hath institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
two Sacraments in his Church; Baptisme,
and the Eucharist: you beleeue so too, but adde
to them fiue other; Matrimonie, Penance, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
Confirmation, and Extreme Vnction.</p>
               <p>Eleuenthly, we beleeue, that grace is annexed
to the Sacraments in such sort, that all those who
worthily receiue them, participate also of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

the Sacraments conferre this grace <hi>ex opere opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
(a worse Solecism in Diuinity, than in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar),
and that God is tied vnto them; so that all
children, dying without Baptism, are necessarily
damned.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, wee beleeue, that the intention of

               <p>Foureteenthly, we beleeue, that we are iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

you beleeue so too, but adde thereunto your

               <p>Fifteenthly, we beleeue, that we ought to pray
for all the members of Christs militant Church
vpon earth: you beleeue so too; but adde ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
that wee may and ought to pray for the
Dead also.</p>
               <p>Sixteenthly, we beleeue and receiue the three
Creeds; the Apostles, the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,</hi>
and the foure generall Councels: you
beleeue them also, but adde a fourth Creed, <hi>viz.</hi>
the twelue new Articles coined by the Pope, and
annexed to the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you see how the Articles of our beleefe
are drawne out of your owne confessions. That
which wee hold for matter of faith necessary to
saluation, you (and, in a manner, all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in the world) hold as we. And therefore our
doctrine is Catholique, according to <hi>Vincentius</hi>
Rule, <hi>quòd ab omnibus, quòd vbique, quòd semper:</hi>
whereas your additions to the Catholique faith,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2020:136"/>
were neuer maintained, neither by all Christians
in any Age, nor by any Christians in all Ages.
Neither you, nor all the Papists in the world, are
able to proue any one point of your <hi>Trent</hi>-faith,
wherein you differ from vs, to be Catholique.</p>
               <p>And now let vs hear your Paralogisms against
my demonstration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect. 1.</hi> First, you say, it conuinceth not the
vnderstanding, and therefore is no demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This obiection of yours sheweth,
that you need to be informed in your vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
how a demonstration conuinceth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
It is not the property of a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
actually to conuince the vnderstanding,
but potentially or vertually. The meaning of this
Proposition, <hi>A demonstration conuinceth the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
is this; that A demonstration hath in it
power and strength to inforce the vnderstanding
of any intelligent man, to assent to the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the premises beeing before apprehended by
him: and euery demonstration is a Syllogisme:
and euery Syllogisme proceedeth <hi>ex quibusdam
positis.</hi> To illustrate this by that vsuall example
of the eclipse of the Moon; which the Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
demonstrate by the cause, to weet, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition
of the earth between the Sun and the
Moon. Before this demonstration will conuince
the vnderstanding of any man, he must first haue
the tearms expounded vnto him: afterwards he
must be taught, that the Moon hath not light of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2020:137"/>
her self, but receiueth it from the Sunne; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Sunne casteth his light by right lines.
Fourthly, it must be shewed how, in such points,
called by Astronomers, <hi>Caput &amp; cauda Draconis,</hi>
the Sunne and Moone are diametrally opposed:
whereby it comes to passe, that, by the interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the earth, the Moon is debarred from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
light by the Sunne-beames. And thus
in the end, the vnderstanding is conuinced by this
demonstration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">That which is hindred from receiuing light
from the Sunne, by the interposition of the
earth, is eclipsed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">But the Moon, in the points aboue-named,
<hi>viz. the head and taile of the Dragon,</hi> is alwaies
hindred from receiuing light from the Sunne,
by the interposition of the earth:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>Ergo</hi> the Moon alwaies in those points is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aquinas</hi> sheweth, that the vnderstanding of a
Ploughman is not conuinced by this demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but onely the vnderstanding of him who is
sufficiently fore-instructed in the tearms and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
heerunto belonging. Therefore as this
demonstration conuinceth not the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
by the bare proposall of the Syllogisme;
but, the assent hauing been before wrought to
the premises, it enforceth and compelleth a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
vnderstanding to assent to the conclusion:
In like manner, I grant, that the bare proposall of
my former Syllogisme will not presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2020:137"/>
a man either vtterly ignorant, or in error, as
I feare you are, to assent to the perpetuall Visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Protestant Church. But if, as I enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
you to assent to the <hi>Maior,</hi> so you would haue
but staied, and suffred mee to inforce the <hi>Minor,</hi>
will you, nill you, you should haue beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to yeeld to the conclusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But say you, in your worthy witty instance,</hi>
This Argument doth no more perswade a man, that the
Protestants are the true visible Church, then a man,
in case of doubt, can bee perswaded by the like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which a man may make, to prooue himselfe and
his brethren to bee as well spoken of as any in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
thus:</p>
               <p>Those who are in heart honest men, are as well spoken
of as any in all the parish, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Good Sir, let mee aduise you to obtaine a
<hi>writ of remoue</hi> for the Windmill: for the whirling
about of the sailes, wrought very much vpon
your braine, as you were a-printing this Answer
in the Cell. Had not you had a whimpsy in your
head, you would neuer haue set this your Paralo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme,
as a Parallel to my demonstration. In my
demonstration, the <hi>Maior,</hi> rightly vnderstood, is
vndoubtedly true, and <hi>de fide,</hi> as your selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
page 23. The Scripture doth shew, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Catholique and Apostolique Church, <hi>both to
haue perpetuall vnchanged faith, and also to bee perpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tually
visible.</hi> But in your Syllogisme, the <hi>Maior</hi> is
apparantly false. If honest men were alwaies wel
spoken of, how can the Apostles words stand, <hi>Sine
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2020:138"/>
per famam,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 8.</note> siue per infamiam,</hi> either by good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
or by euill report, &amp;c? Nay, how can the
words of truth it selfe be verified,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed are yee
when men speake all manner of euill against you for my
sake?</hi> Againe, perpetuity of faith is the adequate
or selfe-sufficient cause of the perpetuall profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
thereof: but honesty in heart is not the cause
of fame, but honest and vertuous actions. It is
not the inward burning, but the outward <hi>shining
of our light before men, which maketh men to see our
good works,</hi> and thereby <hi>glorifie God</hi> in vs for them.
Yet by this your very instance and Syllogisme,
wee haue the better: and therfore, this your Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme
may be fitly tearmed as you will haue it,
A demonstration, but with this addition of <hi>Fishers
folly.</hi> To be an honest man in heart, is both <hi>prius
naturâ,</hi> and morally <hi>eligibilius,</hi> in nature before, and
more desireable, then to be well spoken of. <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
de me dicas, Vir bonus est, ergo bonae famae, quàmè
contra.</hi> By this very argument, the Visibility of the
Church is but <hi>secundarium quid,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a
secundary proofe, and a common accident to the
truth of faith. And as wee therefore enquire of
fame, that we may know a mans vertue: so wee
therefore enquire of the true Church, as your
selfe confesse, Page 23. that by <hi>it wee may learne
the true faith.</hi> We seeke a guide, that we may finde
the way; and not the way, that wee may finde a
guide. If I can otherwise infallibly know a mans
vertue without fame, (put case he liued in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart)
I will not then set it vpon the triall of fame:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2020:138"/>
but in case I should faile of other proofe for a
probable Argument, I would produce fame.
In like manner, if wee had no other infallible
proofe of the true faith, then by the perpetuall
Visibility of the professors thereof, I would hold
it as you doe, a point of principall moment, to
enquire of the Visibility of professors: but sith
we haue another more easie, direct, and infallible
meanes to prooue it, <hi>viz.</hi> by comparing the
doctrine with the Canonicall Scriptures; you
shall giue me leaue, M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> rather to follow
this Method generally prescribed, and vsed by
the Antient Fathers, as I haue shewed before,
Assertion 7. then the other Method prescribed
by you.<note place="margin">Touching the Visibility of the Church. Assertion 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect. 2.</hi> Secondly, you charge my demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
with falshood in both the premises. The
<hi>Maior</hi> you say is false, for that there may bee a
Church or company, who may haue inward
faith, eternall and vnchanged; as for example, a
Church of Angels, &amp;c. An instance as wide from
the mark, as the heauen is distant from the earth.
Our question is of <hi>a visible Church of which all sorts
of men may learne infallible faith necessary to saluation.</hi>
Are Angels visible? Are all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orts of men to learne
infallible faith of a Church of Angels? Doe you
hold it for a good interpretation, <hi>If thy brother of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
thee, tell the Church;</hi> that is, tell <hi>the Angels,</hi>
or a <hi>Church of Angels?</hi> Although Christ bee the
Head of Angels, and they make a part of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
Church in a large sense; yet I neuer
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2020:139"/>
read of a <hi>Church of Angels. Bellarmine</hi> saith in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

The Church is a Society or company, not
of Angels, but of men. If I should haue brought
such an Argument, to proue the militant Church
vpon earth (of which we disputed) to bee inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
because the Angels are inuisible; I should
haue suspected my selfe, to haue beene as wise
as hee that adored, for a Relique, one of the <hi>fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

               <p>Erubuit, salua res est, <hi>you seeme your selfe to
be ashamed of this Answer: and therfore you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
not vpon it, but passe to the</hi> Minor, <hi>burdening
it with falshood; saying,</hi> The Protestants faith is not
vnchanged, but so often changed, and so much subiect
to change, as one may say, as a great person in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Popish faith is so subiect to change, that
wee may say of it, as a learned person in <hi>France</hi>
once said, That if a man <hi>would finde the Popish Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
he must looke into an Almanack for them.</hi> At one
time, the murther of Kings is Catholique doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the time of the League against the
King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> At another time, they pull in
that horne: and then for a season, such murder is
disauowed. That the Councell is aboue a Pope,
was Catholique Doctrine with you in <hi>Martin</hi> the

vs with our late reuised translation: but
see withall, that you dispence with the Pope, that
he may dispence with you. One yeere the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
conception of the blessed Virgin is
maintained in bookes allowed by your Church;
another yeere it is impugned. Lastly, in one yeere
it is determined in bookes set out by authoritie,
among you, that the oath of alleageance may
lawfully bee taken by Roman Catholiques: in
the next yeere wee reade, that hee is no good
Catholique that will take that oath. The title of
vniuersall Bishop was held insolent, arrogant,
profane, Antichristian, Luciferian, in Saint<note n="*" place="margin">

to preserue them from change.</hi> Belike then, the
Scripture is no certaine and infallible rule; but
vnwritten traditions are: the Word of God is

of inerrability. You adde, to piece out your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
argument, that in my demonstration I proue
<hi>magis notum perignotius,</hi> viz. <hi>the visibilitie, which is
easily knowne, by the truth of Doctrine, which is more
hardly knowne, especially by onely Scripture; of the
sense whereof, according to the Protestants, who say,
The whole Church may erre, no particular man can bee
infallibly sure.</hi> The edge of this argument hath
beene turned alreadie in the Remonstrance;
whereunto I adde: First, that visibilitie is more
knowne to sense, then the truth of doctrine, but
not to the vnderstanding of a Christian. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the visiblenesse of a particular present
Church is the obiect of sense; but not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall,
former, and future visibility of any one
Church, much lesse of the vniuersall. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is much easier, out of plaine and euident
Texts of Scripture, together with the three
Creeds, knowne to the simplest among vs (where
the Liturgie is in a knowne Tongue) to deduce
the truth of doctrine necessarie to saluation, then
hee can produce a successiue Catalogue of visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
professours out of good Authors in all Ages.
<hi>Yea but no man,</hi> say you, <hi>can hee infallibly sure of the
sense of Scripture, because Protestants hold, The whole
Church may erre.</hi> In thus arguing, you bewray
either ignorance, or an ill conscience. Ignorance,
if you knowe not, that wee distinguish betweene
the essentiall or formal Church, and the Church
representatiue; of poynts necessarie to saluation,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2020:140"/>
and not necessarie; of euident Texts of Scripture,
&amp; of obscure. But if you knew these distinctions,
as indeed you cannot but knowe them (hauing
read D. <hi>Field</hi> and other Protestant Writers)
you dispute against your conscience. Because,
in obscure and difficult Texts of Scripture, the
Church may erre; will it therefore follow, that
no man can bee sure of the sense of plaine and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
Texts? In which, if wee may beleeue

priuiledged from death</hi> In like manner, whosoeuer
readeth your said seuerall Answers, may obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them; If the Argument aboue-named, was
a <hi>petitio principij,</hi> it could not be a <hi>transitio à genere
in genus:</hi> and if it were a <hi>transitio à genere in genus,</hi>
it could not be a <hi>petitio principij.</hi> If it were a diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
proofe, it could not bee identicall: if it bee
identicall, as you here affirme, it cannot be diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue:
for, it implyes an apparant contradiction,
to say,<note n="*" place="margin">In prouing the same thing by the same thing, digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from the same thing.</note> that a man, in proouing <hi>idem per idem,</hi>
doth <hi>digredi ab eodem.</hi> But you yeeld a reason
why this Argument beggeth or supposeth
that which is in question: <hi>For</hi> (say you) <hi>in asking
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2020:141"/>
which is the true visible Church, or Congregation of
the true faithfull, wee aske, at least vertually, which is
the true faith.</hi> By the like reason, you might proue
euery Demonstration <hi>à priori,</hi> to bee a <hi>petitio prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipij:</hi>
For, in propounding any question touching
the effect, wee enquire vertually and implicitly
of the cause. And therefore <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in <hi>lib. 2.
Poster. Analyt.</hi> acutely prooueth, <hi>omnem quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionem
esse quaestionem medij;</hi> that euerie scienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
question is, in effect, a question of the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
or the cause. By the like Argument you
might prooue, that all Arguments drawne <hi>à



definitione ad definitum,</hi> are <hi>petitiones principij:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
in propounding any question touching
the <hi>definitum,</hi> wee, at least vertually, inquire of
the definition. If the tearmes in my Syllogisme
were but formally distinct, the Syllogisme could
bee no <hi>petitio principij:</hi> how much lesse then can it
bee termed <hi>petitio principij:</hi> when, as it is certaine,
they are distinct really, as your selfe confesse
in your fourth Argument: to which now I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
my selfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, you impeach my Demonstration,
by pushing againe at the</hi> Maior; <hi>saying,</hi> Although
faith be prerequired to be in some or other members of
the true Church; yet inward faith alone, without some
outward profession, by which it is made visible, or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
doth not sufficiently make a man to be a member of
the visible Church.</p>
               <p>It is a true rule in Philosophy: <hi>Vehemens sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile
corrumpit sensum;</hi> the bright light of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2020:142"/>
so buzzardeth you, that you see not
where you are, nor knowe what you are about.
I am so farre from affirming, that <hi>inward
faith, without outward profession, maketh a visible
member of Christs Church;</hi> that from inward faith,
I inferre necessarily <hi>ex consequenti;</hi> outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
which (as I sayd in the Conference)
makes a member of the visible Church. Doo
you grant the consequence, or deny it? If you
grant it, my Argument proceedeth: if you deny
it, <hi>confirmabit pro me vester Aristoteles,</hi> your great
Clerke,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Eccles. Milit. cap. 13.</note> Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> makes good the
consequence in this manner: <hi>Qui non confitentur
fidem, sed, eâ in corde retentâ, exteriùs profitentur per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiam
et idololatriam, non sunt boni, nec saluantur; cùm
ad Roman. 10. dicat Apostolus, Corde creditur ad iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,
ore autem fit confessio ad salutem: et Mat. 10. Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
qui negauerit me coram hominibus, &amp;c.</hi> They are
not good men, nor shall bee saued, who do not
confesse the faith; but, keeping it in their hearts,
outwardly professe perfidiousnesse and idolatry:
For, the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 10.</hi> saith, <hi>With the heart
man beleeueth to righteousnes; but with the tongue man
confesseth to saluation:</hi> And Mathew 10. <hi>Whosoeuer

which is in heauen.</hi>

               <p>Let Master <hi>Fisher</hi> therefore looke back vpon

without expecting M. <hi>Fisher</hi>'s Answer, he turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to the Audience, and said, Hee grants Christ and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2020:147"/>
his Apostles to be Protestants. Whereupon, diuers of
the Audience made such a shout, as if they had gotten a
victory; with such a noise, as M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> endeuouring
to answer, for a time could not be heard. But he rising
vp, and with his hand and voice crauing silence, made
such as would heare him, vnderstand, how falsely D.
<hi>Featly</hi> had slandered him to his face: and either then,
or vpon some like occasion, he said, What may I expect
behinde my back, when you thus mis-report mee to my
face?</p>
               <p>And in this sort, when many of the company
were willing to depart; D. <hi>Featly,</hi> beeing called vpon
(as it seemed) by some of his companions, to goe away,
did arise, and offer to be gone: yet, in his rising, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> saying, Will you dispute vpon Christ
and his Apostles, or no? To which M. <hi>Fisher</hi> said, I will,
if you will stay; and stretching out his hand, hee took
D. <hi>Featly</hi> by his arme, offering to stay him: yet hee, in
that abrupt manner, went away.</p>

               <p>To do as Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> did, is no fit way to giue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to all sorts, expecting resolution of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
most important question: As it were a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
way, to giue satisfaction in a debt of twentie
pieces of gold to another his creditour, if in stead of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
payment required, hee should say and offer to proue
by a syllogisme, yea, by a demonstration <hi>à priori,</hi> that
he can pay him the said twentie pieces, and being vrged
to lay downe the particular peeces of gold, hee saith, that
by an induction hee will lay downe those pieces of gold
one after another; and being farther pressed to doe so,
hee, not hauing one piece of gold of his owne, taketh
out of his creditors purse, one or two, or more pieces;
and laying downe one or two of them, saith, Lo, here is
one or two towards the twentie: and being neuer so
much vrged, he will not lay downe any more, vntill
his creditour first dispute with him, whether these two
or three pieces laid downe bee his owne or no: and being
hereupon seriously told by his creditour, that vnlesse he
laid downe all the pieces of gold, hee did not satisfie the
debt, but lost his credit and forfeited his band; he then
falleth into passion, and saith, <hi>What? will you haue
mee eat my dinner at a bit?</hi> I cannot lay downe all
at once. Will you dispute with mee about these, or no?
Which his creditor refusing to doe, vntill all the twentie
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2020:148"/>
pieces bee actually laid downe; hee lastly saith, Well,
you will not dispute about these: you grant these to bee
mine. And so, without expecting answer, hee turneth
to the companie, saying, Hee granteth these to bee mine,
and taketh vp his cloke, and runneth away, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that his creditour, so soone as hee can open his
mouth, biddeth him stay, and denieth anie such grant
to haue been made by him; yea, offereth to dispute with
him of that poynt, if hee will stay. I suppose, no man
will thinke this kinde of dealing, to bee an honest and
good satisfaction in a debt of monie: and therefore
much lesse should it bee accounted good in matters of for
more importance and value, and specially in satisfying
this (by Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> vndertaken) debt, of shewing
names of visible Protestants in all ages out of good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>

               <p>Wee haue had triall before of your Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
Logicke, and Philosophie, and heer now
you giue vs a cast of your Rhetoricke. The parts
of a good similitude, called <hi>Protasis</hi> and <hi>Antapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosis,</hi>
ought to be like two eyes looking one way,
and not asquint: else they make not a similitude,
but a dissimilitude. Let vs then view the aspect
and cast of these your eyes. As a man, who being
to pay a debt of twentie pieces or pounds to
another his creditour,<note place="margin">Protasis.</note> in stead of actuall paying,
offers to proue by a Syllogisme, that hee can pay
him: and afterwards being pressed, not hauing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2020:148"/>
one piece of gold of his owne, taketh out one
or two pieces out of his creditours purse, and
layeth them downe, and will lay no more
downe, vntill his creditour first dispute with
him whether the pieces laid downe be his owne
or no. And the creditour refusing so to doe, till
the whole summe were laid downe, hee the
debtor taketh vp his cloke, and runneth away:
<hi>Euen so</hi> Doctor <hi>Featly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Antapodosis.</note> being to proue the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
of the Protestant Church, first proued it
by a demonstration <hi>à priori,</hi> and afterwards, at the
importunitie of his aduersarie, vndertooke also
to proue it <hi>à posteriori,</hi> by producing a catalogue
of Names from Christ to <hi>Luther;</hi> and hee began,
<hi>recto et naturali ordine,</hi> with the first age, instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in Christ and his Apostles, very earnestly
pressing and vrging, yea and adiuring also Master
<hi>Fisher</hi> to answer this instance: And vpon Master
<hi>Fishers</hi> finall and peremptorie refusall thereof, he
was pulled away by the companie, and not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to argue any longer with such a one, that
refused to answer Christ and his Apostles.
Hold hooke and line, and the <hi>Fisher</hi> shall catch
a Gudgeon. I grant, a Similitude needeth not <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere
quatuor pedibus,</hi> runne vpon foure feet; yet
certainly it is a very bad Similitude that is lame
of all foure, as this is; and therefore cannot draw
<hi>Dunne</hi> out of the mire. First, to produce a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of Names, was no debt, but rather a merit
or worke of supererrogation: for the visibilitie of
the Protestant Church may bee, and hath beene
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2020:149"/>
sufficiently defended, and demonstratiuely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
without producing any catalogue of names:
and therefore your <hi>similie</hi> limpeth on the first
foot.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to proue the visibilitie of the
Church by a demonstration <hi>à priori,</hi> is not to pay
a debt, by offering to proue, that a man can pay
it; but actually to pay it in the purest gold,
whereas it had been sufficient to pay it in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
siluer or coorser gold. For, a demonstration
<hi>à priori,</hi> as farre exceeds a demonstration <hi>à poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori,</hi>
as gold doth siluer, or the finest Angel gold
baser coine of the same metall; and therefore
your <hi>similie</hi> halteth on the second foot.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to instance in Christ and his Apostles,
was not to lay downe two pieces for twentie,
but to lay downe a Diamond worth manie mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
in stead of twentie peeces: for if the Poet
could say,<note place="margin">Cic. Orator.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato mihi instar millium: Plato</hi> is to mee

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter, as
in your ridiculous <hi>similie</hi> you would imply, but
a matter of the greatest importance of all, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether Christ and his Apostles bee ours
or yours: and therefore your similitude halts
downe-right on this third foot.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is not all one, after a man hath
laid downe two pieces, to stay till they bee
weighed, before hee lay downe any more, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2020:149"/>
simply to refuse to lay downe any more. It is one
thing, voluntarily to goe away; and another
thing, to bee puld away by those of his friends
whom hee hath cause most to respect; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your <hi>similie</hi> is lame also on the fourth foot:
and how then can it stand vpright, much lesse
goe for currant? Nay, the most beggerly crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenesse
of this long-robed comparison, is in the
begging as granted that which is the moment
and ground of the whole question. Hee putteth
the case, that the debter tooke the two pieces
out of the creditours purse. Surely, a blind or
verie credulous creditor, that would stand still
till the debter picked his pocket. O patience!
Good Sir Creditor, if you can, vpon your cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
make good, that those whom you intend by
the two tendered pieces of coyne, namely,
Christ and his Apostles, are the proper legacy
and riches of the Romane treasurie, take vs your
bondmen in stead of payment of the rest. But if
this field, wherein this precious pearle lyeth, bee
by good title ours (as I then would, and at any
time hereafter can proue) I think, vpon such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction,
you will haue small courage to clamour
for the rest of your twentie. Doe but looke on
this coyne, though loth, and see whose image
and superscription it carryeth: is it not the liuely
indeleble Character of our Sauiours Charter,
the Scriptures? They are ours by Christ; Christ
ours by them.</p>
               <p>The Roman pouch is so stuffed with Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2020:150"/>
so choaked with counterfait ouergilt Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of new-minted Articles, that Christ, and his
Apostles, and Euangelists, cannot bee admitted;
nay, will not bee embased, to bee mingled with
such drosse. But I wonder that you dwell so long
vpon a money-<hi>Similie.</hi> I thought you had vowed
pouerty, and might not touch siluer. I haue
heard of some of your orders, that if they touch
coyne, it blisters their hands: as it is reported of
a certaine Lady, that if a Rose-leafe bee put vpon
her hand as shee is asleep, it will make it blister.
But it seemeth to mee, that you are <hi>Theocritus his
Fisher;</hi> you fish for gold; and, if you are not
wronged, haue caught no small number of gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
gudgeons in your net, and transported them
beyond the seas, carrying, <hi>Rem ad non res,</hi> no smal
stock to English Nunneries, I had almost sayd Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitisses
or Loyolasses. And if you will needes
haue a <hi>Similie</hi> from paying monie, to illustrate
this passage in the conference, thus you may
frame it: Suppose a Catalogue for sixteene-hundred
yeeres which haue runne since Christ,
to bee sixteen-hundred pound: suppose the
hundred yeeres to bee a hundred pound: I, by
producing a Catalogue of visible Protestants
in the first age, lay downe a hundred pound of
the summe, and bid you tell it after me, and then
demand of you, whether the summe bee right?
You answer, that you will tell mee, after you
haue told the whole summe of 1600. pounds. I
presse you again &amp; againe, to answer concerning
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2020:150"/>
this first summe, whether it be right or no: if it be
right, I promise to lay down al the rest in the like
manner. You answer as before, Lay downe the
rest, or you shall <hi>not begin with the first &amp; next heap,</hi>
but with the last in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion. I charge you, as you
wil answer it at your peril to your Master, whose
factor you pretend to bee, to giue-ouer all cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
&amp; plainly &amp; directly to answer me, whether
this first sum be right or not: and when, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this deep charge, you trifle &amp; cauill, the
witnesses, who were to set their hands to my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
pul me away, saying, <hi>You shal deale no more
with such a cauilling factor.</hi> This is a true &amp; perfect

when this speech should bee made by the Gentleman to

it would argue too much want of capacitie: for if hee

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2020:151"/>
producing of names beeing so oft and earnestly required
to bee done in all Ages, and yet beeing onely pretended
(and that most falsely) to be done for one Age, and the

he would goe forward to name men in other Ages,
especially in Ages before <hi>Luther;</hi> at the question requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; any meane capacitie might see, that the Question in
which the old Gentleman desired to bee satisfied; was
not fully answered, nor consequently hee satisfied.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the same Gentleman beeing present;
when the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> told M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> that D.
<hi>Featly</hi> should at another time come againe to giue

that at the next meeting his Question should bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered:
which shewed, that as yet he did not conceiue it
to be answered.</p>

as you please, How I could bee resolued
by the Conference? I am sure, I was resolued,
and so still continue. When the Philosopher in
<hi>A. Gellius,</hi> sophistically disputed against motion
in this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whatsoeuer is mooued locally, is either moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the place wherein it is, or wherein it is
not. It cannot be mooued in the place wherein
it is not, because that is not to mooue locally,
or in place: where the body hath no existence,
it can haue no motion. Neither can a body be
said to mooue in the place wherein it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
while a body remaines in its place, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
mooue from it:</q> One of his Auditors there

vnlearned man, by two or three blunt Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
conquered and quite confounded him.
Wil you from this, and the like instances, inferre,
that the men so conuerted, were men of meane
capacity? The contrary euidently appeares in
Story: you should rather from hence gather with
religious <hi>Austen</hi> (who may truly be said to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

written, rather <hi>ex gratia,</hi> then <hi>degratia,</hi> so gratiously
doth hee write of grace) <hi>totum Deo dare, qui vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem

euery good work after, <hi>to ascribe all to God, who
both prepares the will to be aided by grace, and aideth it
beeing prepared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, but say you, M. <hi>Bugges</hi> much desired a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
meeting: therefore it seemes, he was not so
resolute a Protestant as wee make him. If this
were a good Argument, you might prooue all of
our side to be vnsettled in our Religion; yea, M.
Deane of <hi>Carlile,</hi> and my selfe also, who much
desired, and yet doe, a second meeting, to perfect
the work then begun. Though a man be neuer
so well resolued in poynt of Religion, yet hee
may desire to heare Diuinity-Disputations, and
make good vse of them. Yea, but M. <hi>Bugges</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
M. <hi>Fisher</hi> and M. <hi>Sweet</hi> to giue him a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of names of professors in the Romane
Church; saying, that if after this, the Doctors
would not giue him a Catalogue of Protestants,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2020:154"/>
hee would dislike their cause. If M. <hi>Bugges</hi> spake
so (which I haue reason to doubt) hee spake it,
as hauing certaine knowledge, that we had a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue,
which hee did or might haue seene in
the Conference. Nor indeed doth the desiring
or requiring of a Catalogue, inferre any doubt of
the conclusion. Though a plaine vnlearned
Christian beleeue most firmely, that Christ was
borne of the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> yet
may he desire more particular information, by
hearing the beginning of Saint <hi>Mathews,</hi> or Saint
<hi>Lukes</hi> Gospell read and expounded to him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
when I vndertooke to name those who
taught Protestant Doctrine in all Ages, if I
should faile therein, he should haue had iust cause
to dislike my proceedings. Yea but, say you,
there was no cause giuen in the Conference at
all, of any effectuall resolution to be made by
the old Gentleman: therefore he could not bee
so resolued by it, as is pretended. For answer
heereunto, though I am loth, yet you constraine
mee to recapitulate the chiefe points touched in
the Conference. Before the Conference, M.
<hi>Bugges</hi> was somewhat staggered in the poynt
touching the Visibility of the Church, by your
<hi>brauadoes,</hi> and <hi>Rhodomontadoes, that all the world
were Papists before</hi> Luther; <hi>That there was neither</hi>
vola <hi>nor</hi> vestigium <hi>of a Protestant Church before that
time;<note place="margin">A briefe reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> That no Protestant Minister durst encounter you
in this point: if any should be so hardy, as to enter into
these lists with you; you would presently blank, silence,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2020:154"/>
and nouplus them.</hi> Thus possessed, and in some sort
perplexed by your bold and confident asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and false suggestions; hee with much adoe,
by Sir <hi>Humfrey Lyndes</hi> meanes, procures a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference:
wherein hee findes all things otherwise
then hee might expect. Hee and all the Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
obserued D. <hi>White,</hi> and my selfe, to bee very
ready and earnest to proceed in the Questions;
both to prooue the Visibility of our Church, and
disprooue theirs. On the contrary, he could not
but see you to cast all manner of <hi>Remoraes</hi> and
rubs, to hinder speedie and direct proceedings:
and for the Questions touching the Visibility of
the Church,</p>
               <p>First, hee heard, that the perpetuall Visibility
of the Church, beeing a point of faith, was
not to bee built vpon deduction from humane
Stories and good Authors, as the Iesuite requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
but vpon diuine reuelation in Gods Word,
as is confessed by<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>doneum, ad faciendum cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam in theologia fidem.</note> learned Papists.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that a Protestant Church might
haue beene visible in all Ages, and yet not the
names of visible Protestants now to bee produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and prooued out of good Authors, because
neither all mens names euer were vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
nor are all antient Records preserued to
this day, neither can wee come by all those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
that are yet extant.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that notwithstanding the Popish brag,
that <hi>All the Christian world were Papists before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
yet you were not able to name any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2020:155"/>
City, Village or Hamlet, nay not any man,
who for 500. yeeres and more after Christ, either
professed your Trent-faith in generall, or those
fifteene points recited in the Conference in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that the surest and strongest meanes
to prooue the perpetuall Visibility of a Church,
was <hi>á priori,</hi> by the conformity of it's faith to the
Scriptures: of which faith, God promiseth in
his Word, that it shall haue visible Professors to
the worlds end.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that a visible Church inferrs not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
a right faith. Iews, Mahumetanes, Gentiles,
and diuers sorts of blasphemous Hereticks, haue
visible professors of their impieties: yet are
they all of a wrong beliefe; if of any on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the right faith inferreth necessarily a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church, because the true faith cannot bee
in a Church, which professeth it not openly, or
priuately: therefore the prime and maine que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of all is, of the right beliefe, of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
and Catholique faith, whether wee or the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> haue it; and not of a Catalogue
of names.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that an offer was made, to name some
eminent persons, which in al Ages taught Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Doctrine, and opposed the Romish errors,
either when they came in, or not long after; and
that this Catalogue had beene a good way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in, if you had not beene the cause by
your delayes and tergiuersations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:2020:155"/>
Lastly, that when I instanced in Christ and his
Apostles, and vrged you againe and againe, yea
and adiured you also to answer directly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they taught our faith or yours; yet you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
and finally refused so to doe: which
hee might well interpret, to proceed from your
apparant distrust in your cause.</p>
               <p>And now let the discreet Reader iudge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
M. <hi>Bugges</hi> had not reason to alter his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning you and your cause, at least in that
particular, of which only he seemed to doubt of.</p>

Lordship was present at a late Conference, wherein
D. <hi>White</hi> and D. <hi>Featly</hi> vndertook to shew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
mee and my companion, that the Protestant
Church had beene visible in all Ages, and that their
Professors might be named, especially in the Ages before
<hi>Luther.</hi> Your Lordship may remember the substance
of all the proofe to haue consisted in this, that The true
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2020:156"/>
Church was alwaies so visible, as the Professors thereof
in all Ages might be named: but the Protestants was
the true Church. Wee refused to dispute of the <hi>Minor,</hi>
because it transferd the Question, and auoyded that
plaine proofe of the visible Church, which was then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
and expected. If<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they conclude, they are
able to name their Professors in all Ages, why did they
refuse to giue vs a Catalogue of theirs, as we were ready
to haue giuen them another of ours? Why went they
about to prooue they were able to name them, when with
lesse adoe they might haue named them? Where deeds are
iustly expected, words without deeds are worthily neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
               <p>Certainely, heereby they are so farre from hauing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
themselues of the great enterprize they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took,
as they stand more engaged then before, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it. For, hauing now professed and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that the true Church, or (to vse their owne
words) <hi>the Church that is so visible as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church ought to bee (and the Church,
whose faith is eternall and vnchanged, must bee),
is able to name her Professors in all Ages,</hi> either
for their owne honour, and for the satisfaction of the
world, they must set down the names of their Professors
in all Ages; or else they shamefully discouer themselues,
not to be that true and visible vnchanged Church, which
is able to name them. Againe, at the length yeelding (as
they did) to shew the continual Visibility of their Church,
by a full induction of their visible Protestants in all
Ages, (which they seemed to vndertake with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence),
why did they stick in the first Age alone, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2020:156"/>
to name their professors in the Ages following, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the first were tried? May not the Answerer choose to
deny which part of the Argument hee pleaseth? and was
it euer heard, that hee should bee inforced to reply to one
proposition alone, before the whole Argument, whether
it were Syllogism or Induction, were fully propounded?

owne partie, within three or foure daies would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to giue vs the names of their Professors in all Ages,
as wee were ready to giue them the names of ours, that
thereby both sides might bee the better prepared for a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

not faile to encounter with them, either by way of speech
or writing, as your Lordship (all things considered)
shal think fairest, or safest, or most conuenient for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery

bee accounted a plaine flight, and no man heereafter can

Letter, no Letter, relating, not relating, the

               <p>First, it may bee call'd <hi>a priuate Letter,</hi> because
it was seald vp like <hi>a priuate Letter,</hi> and indorsed
to an Honorable Personage; yet it was no <hi>priuate
Letter:</hi> for, diuers copies of it were dispersed

was set vpon it, onely to make it more passable,
and to giue vent for such cheating wares, as
Master <hi>Fisher</hi> thought, would passe more currant,
by a Letter addressed to so Noble a Personage.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>it relateth, and not relateth,</hi> because
it omitteth much more then it relateth: for the
Introduction in the beginning, and the Induction
in the end of the Conference, and all my Replies
in the middle, they are all not circumcised only,
as the Argument here relateth, but quite cut out.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it relateth my <hi>Argument, not my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;

according to my owne opinion, but as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly

vpon your owne ground: vpon which to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant

not at all to haue descended to an Induction,

to conuince you, and to satisfie some of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory,
I beganne a Catalogue, and had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

not without adiuration: Secondly, so vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to require an Opponent to prooue at once,
eminent professors for 1500 yeeres, to haue
taught Protestant Doctrine. Was there euer any
that vndertook to make good a catalogue of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
in all Ages, who did not first prooue, that
there were such in the first Age, and then in the
second, <hi>et sic de caeteris,</hi> and so in the rest? Was

answer an Argument by Induction of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
consisting of 15 or rather 15 hundred parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2020:158"/>
(and al in his iudgement questionable) who
did not answer them piece-meale in order, first
applying his Answer to the first particular, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
to the second, &amp;c? I cannot patterne you
better, then by that malefactor, who hauing stolne
my Oxen, and beeing indited for them seuerally,
would not answer directly to the first enditement,
Guilty or not guilty; but said; still that hee had
that Oxe with his fellowes; heereby hoping,
vpon tryall of the whole in one lump, to escape
by his book, or benefit of Clergie, as wee call
it. In like manner, when you were put to it,
to answer directly, Whether the Protestant
Professors were not visible in the first Age, and so
in the second, and so in the third, &amp;c? you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
It was not visible in the first Age, <hi>with the
rest,</hi> nor in the second <hi>with the rest,</hi> and further
you will not goe. The difference betweene you,

confusedly, to saue his neck; and you, to saue the
rack of an Argument; he, to slip out by his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
you, by your vnclerkly Sophistry. You may
bee sure, such kinde of foggie and misty answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
could no way satisfie a man of so cleere a

this nature, as the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> is. Which

it was a Disputation appointed by me, or no;
and whether I was not satisfied with it. Whereby
I perceiue, those that learne the doctrine of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,
will not spare to tell a plaine lye, to doe
any man wrong that is not of their opinion. And
I am the more confirmed in this opinion: for,
since last night, M. <hi>Plume</hi> came to mee, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
this enclosed letter, which I much maruell
at. I would not answer it, but thus: that I would
speake with you, and that M. <hi>Fisher</hi> should not
need feare, that D. <hi>Featly</hi> would flee from him,
but meet him at any time, to make good his <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</hi>
I had thought to haue spoken with you my

this day into the countrey. Wherefore, if you
meet, I pray let the company know, for the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that I knew of it but halfe an howre before
it was, and I came at the request of another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and for no desire of mine to be satisfied:
for I thank God, my conscience makes no doubt
of the truth of our Religion. This I say, because
I heare that some of that Religion giue it out, It

               <p>NOW hauing made an end of this Relation, I
am to intreat the gentle Reader to reuiew it, or
reflect vpon it, and to call to minde, and mark,
first, the occasion, and consequently, the end of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
secondly, the Question, and true meaning of it;
thirdly, what method was most fit to be obserued, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this Question; fourthly, what course was taken
by the Protestant Disputant, and what by the Catholique
Respondent. All which beeing duly considered, thou
wilt better see what is to bee iudged of the whole Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and wilt make to thy selfe more benefit of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
treated in it, then perhaps hitherto thou hast done
about the occasion.</p>

               <head>Doctor FEATLY his Answer.</head>
               <p>THere is a threefold sight.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>per radium rectum,</hi> by a right beame
or line betweene the eye and obiect; as when I
looke directly vpon a mans face, and behold the
shape and proportion thereof as it is in it selfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>per radium reflexum,</hi> by a reflected
line or beame; as, when I behold a mans face
and shape in a glasse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>per radium refractum,</hi> by a broken
beame; as, when I behold the same mans face, or
any thing else through <hi>dispar medium,</hi> as water or
glasse. Whosoeuer viewes your <hi>Reflection,</hi> as you
call it, with a single eye, will iudge, that it ought
rather to haue been tearmed a <hi>Refraction;</hi> not for
that it proceeds from a man of a <hi>broken</hi> brain: (for
your intellectuals are good enough) but because
you defend a <hi>broken</hi> cause; and your proofes are
<hi>broken</hi> scraps taken out of <hi>Brerelies</hi> alsme-box: and
you represent no truth entirely, but <hi>brokenly.</hi> If it
represent any thing entirely, as by reflection, it
is the <hi>Fisher</hi> viewing himselfe vnhappily <hi>caught in
his owne net,</hi> struggling and striuing to breake out
of it, but all in vaine; <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>As I haue before <hi>related</hi> your <hi>Relation:</hi> so I

wherein I finde,</p>
               <p>First, matter of repetition touching the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and meaning of it, and the occasion of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2020:160"/>
Conference and method vsed in it; whereunto I
haue answered before, and it is very tedious to

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, matter of additions, which are of
two sorts; either personall, and these concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</p>
               <p>My selfe: for answer whereunto, I refer
you to the <hi>appendix;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Master <hi>Salisburie,</hi> a diligent Preacher &amp;
smart Disputant, who either hath alreadie,
or will shortly meete with you at <hi>Fishers
folly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or real, to wit, certain allegations crudely
taken out of Master <hi>Brerelyes</hi> Protestants A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie,
falsely so called, <hi>tractatu 2. c. 2. sect.
11. subdiuis. 3.</hi> to proue, that by the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Protestants, there were no Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
before <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, although I might iustly passe-ouer in
silence those testimonies, partly, because I haue
no particular quarrell with Master <hi>Brerely,</hi> but
with your selfe; partly, because none of those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations
come neere the <hi>Outworkes,</hi> much lesse
the <hi>Castle</hi> of my defence: yet I hold it not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnfit to examine them particularly, that the
indifferent Reader may see with what sinceritie
you cite testimonies out of Protestant Writers.

to those that view them neere at hand:

               <p>First, I answer, that <hi>Luthers</hi> words in his <hi>Epistle

which innumerable soules haue been helped. A
speech as modest as true, far different from that

               <p>Secondly, if you can, in any Epistle <hi>ad Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentin.</hi>
or elsewhere in <hi>Luthers</hi> workes, find those
words, <hi>Wee dare boast, that Christ was first published
by vs;</hi> the meaning of them may bee gathered
from many other places of <hi>Luther,</hi> to bee this,
that in those parts of the Christian world, he was
the first that publiquely made head against the
Roman errors, and sent a Flag of defiance to the
Antichrist of Rome, and vindicated the truth of
Christs Gospel, so long with-held in vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes.</p>

that himselfe had been left alone; and therefore

I neuer wanted courage in these combats; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that I am rather accused of the contrarie,
of an ouerpoignant stile and fierie zeale:
yet I alwaies wished, that God would take mee
from among my <hi>Baalites,</hi> and that, being ciuilly
dead, I might enioy my selfe in some corner;
vtterly despairing of doing any good vpon the
brazen foreheads and iron necks of the wicked.
But behold, it is told mee also (as it was told
<hi>Elias)</hi> that God hath reserued vnto himselfe a
remainder (of true beleeuers) euen in this time,
&amp; that there are Prophets kept in secret: neither
is this said onely vnto me, but demonstrated vnto
me also, to my great comfort: for, <hi>Wesselus Frisius
Groningensis</hi> (whom they call <hi>Basil)</hi> is lately set
out in print, a man of a rare and great spirit, and
admirable wit, who (it appeares) was truely
taught of God, as those Christians were to bee,
of which <hi>Esay</hi> prophesieth. For, it cannot bee
thought, that hee receyued his learning from
men; as neither did I. If I had read this Author
before, my enemies might haue thought, that I
drew all out of <hi>Wesselus</hi> Store-house, his spirit &amp;
mine so perfectly agree.</p>

Hus,</hi> and therein obserued the Scriptures so
powerfully and so purely handled, that I
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2020:164"/>
began to maruell why the Pope and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
should burne a man of such worth: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
I shut the booke; suspecting, that vnder
hony there might lye hid some poyson,
where-with my simplicitie might haue been
infected. So strongly was I bewitched with the
name of a Pope and a Councell.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But after that, &amp;c. there began the ioy of
my heart: and viewing all those whom the
Pope had condemned, and put to death for
Heretiques, I esteemed them as Saints &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;
especially those whose godly writings and
confessions I could finde, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Among these, I met with those brethren
whom they call <hi>Pigards,</hi> who were not now
so hatefull to mee, as they had been formerly
in the time of my Popery. To be briefe, I found
in these men a miracle, and that a very great
one, almost vnheard of in the Popish Church,
to wit, that these men, leauing the doctrines of
men, to the vtmost of their indeauour medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Law of God day and night, and were
very readie and skilfull in Scriptures; whereas
in the papacie, the greatest clarkes vtterly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the Scriptures.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And I could not but congratulate both them
&amp; vs, that we who before were far seuered one
from another (esteeming each other as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques)
now by the breaking downe of the
partition wall of suspition, became neere one to
the other, and were together brought into one
Sheepefold.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:2020:164"/>
Wherefore I commend to all the seruants of
God, this confession of the Brethren, whereby all
men may cleerely perceiue how wrongfully they
haue beene condemned and vexed by the Papists.</p>
               <p>Now how worthily <hi>Martin Luther</hi> conceyued

that good man wrong: and <hi>Erasmus Roterodam</hi> in
the first bookes which hee printed (lying yet by

not conuicted. This was the iudgement of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men alwaies, concerning <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> that great
wrong and violence was offered vnto him. For
proofe whereof, hee alleageth Doctor <hi>Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
and <hi>Andrew Praule;</hi> and in the end, addeth
moreouer, It is a thing confessed, euen by our
Aduersaries themselues (some of whom, beeing
great Diuines, I heard 30 yeeres agoe), that <hi>Iohn
Hus</hi> was excellently learned, and farre beyond
all the Doctors in that Councell. I my selfe,
when I was a young Student in Diuinity at <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
meeting with a booke of Sermons, penn'd
by <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> was inflamed with a desire of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2020:165"/>
it thorow, that I might know what were
the heresies which this Arch-heretick broached.
This book was happily kept from burning, lying
hid among many other in the publique Library:
in the reading whereof, I was amazed, and could
not sufficiently admire what the cause might be,
that so great a Clarke, so expert and dexterous in
expounding and handling Scripture, should bee
burned.</p>
               <p>Thus you see, how farre <hi>Luther</hi> was from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
from any of his fore-runners: to whom
hee yeelded as ample a testimony for the Truth,
as they had yelded to the Truth. And I desire
the indifferent Reader to obserue, how <hi>Iohn Hus</hi>
his prophesie before his death, was fulfilled in
<hi>Luthers</hi> vindicating his doctrine and person.
<hi>Iohn Hus</hi> his words were, which are yet to bee
seene, stamped in antient coyne, currant among
the Hussites, <hi>Centum reuolutis annis, &amp;c. After a
hundred yeeres, you shall answer God and mee:</hi> and
some affirme, that hee added, <hi>Iam Hus,</hi> that is,
in the Bohemian Language, <hi>Goose: but there shall
follow mee a Swan, &amp;c.</hi> And indeed, after a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres, that Swan appeared in the world,
which most sweetly beganne to record the pure
notes of the Songs of <hi>Sion,</hi> whose strong quill
hath eternized <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> his innocencie of life,
and purity of Doctrine.</p>

to say, that many learned men in</hi> Germany
<hi>did hold the doctrine of the Lutheran Gospell. Schlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senburgs</hi>
words are, <hi>Impudenter scribit Vtenboyus
seex Conrado Pellicano audiuisse, multos viros erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos
in Germaniâ, priusquam prodiret Lutherus, euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelij
doctrinam tenüisse; adeoque, ipsum Pellicanum,
priusquam auditum esset nomen Lutheri, Purgatorium
Papisticum reiecisse. Vtenboius</hi> writes impudently,
that he heard <hi>Conradus Pellicanus</hi> affirme, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
learned men in <hi>Germany</hi> held the doctrine of
the Gospell, before <hi>Luther</hi> appeared; and that <hi>Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanus</hi>
himselfe impugned the Popish Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
before the name of <hi>Luther</hi> was heard. For
ought I know, <hi>Vtenboius</hi> is as honest a man, as <hi>Schlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senburgius:</hi>
and if <hi>Schlusenburgius</hi> deny it, <hi>Vtenboius</hi>
affirmeth it, yea, and (for ought is prooued to the
contrary) <hi>Conradus Pellicanus</hi> also: yet that which
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2020:167"/>
                  <hi>Schlusenburg</hi> maintaineth for the honor of his
Master, no way helpeth your cause: for, admit
there were not in <hi>Germany,</hi> yet there might bee
elsewhere many thousands, as in <hi>Bohemia, France,
England, &amp;c.</hi> who, before <hi>Luther,</hi> embraced the
doctrine of the Gospell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in <hi>Germany</hi> it selfe, there were not
<hi>multi eruditi viri,</hi> many learned men; yet there
might be some, for ought <hi>Schlusenburg</hi> saith to
the contrary: therefore <hi>Schlusenburges</hi> testimony
falls very short, neither doth <hi>George Myllius</hi> his
come much neerer to the marke. His words are, <hi>Si
antecessores</hi> Lutherus <hi>in officio habuisset Orthodoxos; Si
Apostasia commissa ab Episcopis Pontificijs non fuisset,
Lutherana reformatione opus non fuisset. Non ergo
possumus veros monstrare Episcopos, qui ante</hi> Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
<hi>sub Papatu fuerint praedecessores</hi> Lutheri. <hi>Si enim
tales fuissent in Romana Ecclesia discedendi ab ista, causa
non fuisset.</hi> If <hi>Luther</hi> had had orthodoxall
Predecessors in his Office; If the Popish
Bishop had not made an Apostasie, there
should haue beene no need of a Lutheran
Reformation. Therefore, we cannot shew true
Bishops vnder the Papacie, to whom <hi>Luther</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded:
for if there had beene such in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Church, there had beene no cause to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from it. What makes this testimony for you?
Is it for the honor of your Church, to bee truly
branded with Apostasie? to haue no orthodoxal
Bishops bearing rule in it? What though there
were no right-beleeuing Bishops vnder or in the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2020:168"/>
Papacy; will it follow, that there were no right-beleeuing
Christians elsewhere? It is true, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
presupposeth a Deformation, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
presupposeth a disease; &amp; a purgation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
matter fit to bee purged. Though the
Romane Church, or rather the predominant
faction in the Romane Church, was vnsound in
the faith, and very corrupt and rotten; yet were
there other sound members of Christs Church,
in whose steps, it is well knowne, that <hi>Luther</hi>
trod. What a paralyticall Paralogisme is this?

Waldenses:</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">De vestro cum Waldensibus consensu optima quaeque spero, non modò quia sanctam vnita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, in quam co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alescunt Christi membra, Deus semper benedice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re solitus est, sed quòd inter haec rudimenta, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Waldensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um peritiam, quam longo vsu Dominus exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, non vulgari adiumento vobis fore spero. Quare vobis omnibus danda est opera, vt haec pia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiratio magis ac magis sancia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp;c.</note> I hope the best of your agreement with
the Waldenses; not onely, because God alwaies vseth to
blesse the holy vnity, in which the members of Christ
grow vp together, but also, because in these your rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and beginnings, I conceiue, that the skill and long
experience of the Waldenses, will bee an extraordinary
help vnto you: wherefore all of you must doe the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of your endeuours, that this holy agreement &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
betweene you, may more and more be established,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> (whom you alleage in the
next place) held the like correspondence
with the Waldenses, as may be gathered from
that Letter of his which hee wrote vnto
them.</p>
               <p>Blessed be the Lord God our louing Father, who hath
preserued you to this present time, in so great knowledge
of his truth, and who hath now inspired you in the search
thereof, hauing made you capable and fit to doe it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
now, what the nature of true faith is, which is, that
so soone as it knowes in part any spark of the diuine light,
it preserueth carefully the things that are giuen vnto it
of God. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is an example to vs, who in all his
epistles, shewes the great care that he hath had to procure
the glory of God. And doubtlesse, if wee pray with a
good heart, that the name of God be sanctified, and his
Kingdome may come, we shall prosecute nothing with
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2020:171"/>
such diligence, as the establishment of the truth where it
is not, and the aduancement thereof where it is already
planted. One onely thing doth especially grieue mee, that
our imployments at this time are such, about other
affaires, that wee haue no leasure to answer you at large,
as we desire, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By the contents of this Letter, and many other
passages in <hi>Bucers</hi> Works, which for breuities
sake I omit, it appeares that <hi>Bucer,</hi> in calling
<hi>Luther</hi> the first Apostle of the reformed Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
did not thereby intend, that <hi>Luther</hi> was the
first that euer preached the Doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches; for, hee could not bee ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
that after Christ and his Apostles, and
the Fathers for 6 or 700 yeers, <hi>Bertram,</hi> &amp; <hi>Elfrick,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and <hi>Petrus Brus,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Tolous,</hi>
and <hi>Dulcinus,</hi> and <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> and <hi>Lollardus,</hi> and
<hi>Wicklef,</hi> and <hi>Hus,</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and many
other Starres, fought in their courses against the
Romish <hi>Sisera.</hi> But <hi>Bucers</hi> meaning is, that <hi>Luther</hi>
was the first, who in our Age and memory, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
and success-fully set on foot a generall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Church in these Westerne
parts: when the corrupt matter of Popish errors
and superstitions long in gathering, grew now
to a ripe coare, <hi>Luther</hi> was the first who openly
lanced it. <hi>Luther</hi> formed no new Church, but
reformed the Church hee found; and therefore
cannot bee termed, The first Apostle of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Doctrine; although, in a tolerable sense,
hee may be stiled, The first Apostle of the happie
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2020:171"/>
Reformation in our daies. <hi>Luther</hi> burnisht and
refined the gold of the Sanctuary, obscured
with rust: he made not new gold.</p>
               <p>In your allegation out of <hi>Beza,</hi> by suppressing
the Aduerb <hi>(penè,</hi> almost), you shew your selfe,
<hi>non penè,</hi> not almost, <hi>sed penitùs,</hi> altogether a falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficator.
<hi>Beza's</hi> words, <hi>Epist. 5.</hi> are, <hi>Huic tum demum
locum esse dicimus, cùm vel nulla, vel penè nulla est or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaria
vocatio, sicut nostris temporibus accidit in Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu.</hi>
We say, that then extraordinary calling takes
place, when there is either no, or almost no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
vocation (<hi>of Pastors</hi>), as in our time fell out
in the Papacie. This (<hi>almost</hi>) you omit altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For <hi>Beza's</hi> opinion, touching extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
calling, as I doe not heere oppugne, so much
lesse doe I vndertake to maintaine. We can, and
haue prooued lawfull &amp; ordinary calling in our
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as you may see in M. <hi>Masons</hi>
most accomplished Treatise of this Subject, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reuised by him before his death, and translated
into Latine, at this instant sweating vnder the
Presse. Admit, there had beene no ordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of right-beleeuing Church-men, Bishops,
or Priests, when <hi>Luther</hi> did first sound his siluer
Trumpet: what will you inferre thereupon?
that at that time there was no visible Church?
There <hi>Beza</hi> leaues you, who professeth both a
visible Church in generall, consisting of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
sound and vnsound, and these more or lesse;
and in particular,<note place="margin">In his booke of worthy men.</note> hee calleth the Waldenses, <hi>The
seed of the most pure, antient, Christian Church, which
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2020:172"/>
was miraculously preserued in the midst of the darknes
and errors, which haue beene hatched by Satan in these
latter times.</hi> And as <hi>Beza</hi> leaues you, in this
your inference, so also doth the Truth:
For, although the Ship of Christ is in great
danger, when erronious <hi>Pastors,</hi> like false lights,
are set vp in the Watch-Towers of <hi>Sion,</hi> yet, sith
our chiefe <hi>Pilot</hi> hath forewarned vs heereof, and
bid vs take heede of <hi>false prophets</hi> and <hi>teachers,</hi>
and hath left vs a most certaine direction in his
Word, which is the true Light, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
conduct vs to those <hi>pulchri portus,</hi> the faire Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
in Heauen; the people of God may keepe
the right way, and through Gods grace escape
the quick-sands of heresie. As God bestoweth
diuers gifts of the <hi>Spirit</hi> ordinarily vpon the
Clergie, so he bestoweth also where he pleaseth,
<hi>Spiritum discretionis,</hi> in the <hi>Laytie, a Spirit</hi> whereby
they may discerne <hi>spirits,</hi> whether they are of
God or no; <hi>a Spirit,</hi> by which, <hi>trying all things,
they may hold fast that is good.</hi> And if their ghostly
Fathers offer them <hi>a stone for bread,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 9, 10.</note> or a <hi>Serpent
for fish,</hi> they will cast it away: Or if more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
they shall mingle error and heresie with
truth, and offer them, as your Teachers did and
doe, an apple with a worme in it, or a cup of
wine with a dead Fly, they will take out the
worm and Fly, and then eat of the one, and drink
of the other. This is that which<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Baltasar</hi> Praefat. in Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</note>

obserueth, <hi>Oft-times the eares of the Auditors are
purer then the tongue of the Preacher.</hi> Hee deliuers
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2020:172"/>
vngarbled spices, they garble it; vnsifted meale,
they sift and boult it; impure milke, they straine
it. In the daies of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and much more after
the death of the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> vntill the birth
of Christ, there were few<note n="*" place="margin">(I would see a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of true Teachers of the infallible faith in those times.)</note> Doctors in <hi>Israel,</hi>
that rightly expounded the Law, and taught
Gods people as they ought: yet no man doubts
that God had then a visible Church; as also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in the time of the Arrian &amp; Eutychian
persecution, in which there were very few Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
or Pastors vntainted with those heresies:
Therefore, although we should grant you your
antecedent out of <hi>Beza,</hi> that there was no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
vocation at that time, of pure and sincere
Teachers, yet wee will barre you of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
that at that time there was no visible
Church. Our English Diuines, alledged by
you, affirme no such thing. <hi>Perkins</hi> saith not,
that our Church was simply inuisible, but that
it was not visible to the world; adding in the
same place, that <hi>it lay hid vnder the chaffe of Popery.</hi>
And the truth of this, saith hee, the Records of
all Ages manifest. The same <hi>Perkins,</hi> in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Catholick,</hi> more fully explaineth his
meaning, thus: <hi>Though Popery raigned and ouerspred
the face of the earth, for many hundred yeeres: yet in
the middest thereof, God reserued a people to himselfe,
that truly worshipped him; The woman fled into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
&amp;c. And she still retaines a remnant of her
seed, which keepe the commandement of God, and haue
the testimony of Iesus Christ.</hi> See here how farre
